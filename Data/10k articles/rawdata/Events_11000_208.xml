The '''2012 ICT Skype controversy''' was the leaking of [[Skype]] conversations and emails between [[Mohammed Nizamul Huq]], head judge and chairman of [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal]], and Ahmed Ziauddin, a Bangladeshi lawyer based in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The trial of the birth of a nation |url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21568349-week-chairman-bangladeshs-international-crimes-tribunal-resigned-we-explain |magazine=[[The Economist]] |date=15 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conversations took place during the prosecution of the accused for alleged [[war crimes]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971.

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', the recordings and emails suggested that the Bangladesh Government pressured and attempted to intervene in the International Crimes Tribunal to speed up proceedings. The neutrality and independence of Huq was called into question, as Ziauddin appeared to help him to prepare documents for the tribunal and made detailed recommendations for Huq. Ziauddin also advised prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor Zaed-al-Malum, and informed Huq about how the prosecutors may develop their cases. This resulted in a connection between the judge, adviser and the prosecution.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt;

The 17 hours of conversations between 28 August and 20 October 2012 and more than 230 e-mails between September 2011 and September 2012 were disclosed to ''The Economist.''&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt; The Bangladeshi newspaper ''[[Amar Desh]]'' also received the conversations, and published a report on 9 December, followed by the transcripts in full. On 13 December, a court injunction banned Bangladeshi newspapers from publishing the materials, at which time ''Amar Desh'' stopped further publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2013/01/bangladesh-journalist-faces-sedition-charges/ |title=Bangladesh newspaper editor at risk |date=8 January 2013 |website=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 December 2012, Huq resigned from his position as chairman of ICT-1, citing personal reasons. Despite demands from [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] for the Tribunal to be scrapped, the Law Minister [[Shafique Ahmed]] said that Huq's resignation would not hamper trial proceedings.&lt;ref name=DSHuq&gt;{{cite news |date=12 December 2012 |title=Tribunal chief quits over Skype scandal |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-260836 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December, Fazle Kabir, then head of the second tribunal (ICT-2), was named as the new chairman.&lt;ref name=DSKabir&gt;{{cite news |date=13 December 2012 |title=Justice Kabir new chief |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-260968 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants' applications for retrials were rejected.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype3&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Bloodletting after the fact |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2013/03/bangladeshs-war-crimes-trials |magazine=[[The Economist]] |date=1 March 2013 |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)}}

The International Crimes Tribunal was set up in [[Bangladesh]] in 2009 to prosecute suspects accused of war crimes during the Bangladesh Liberation War. The [[Awami League]] had pledged to do so in the campaign for the [[Bangladeshi general election, 2008|2008 election]]. Between 2010 and 2012, the tribunal indicted eleven men as suspects; they are now political leaders, nine from Jamaat-e-Islami, two from the [[Bangladesh National Party|BNP]] and zero from the Awami League. At the time of the Skype controversy, the trials of [[Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury]], [[Motiur Rahman Nizami]] and [[Ghulam Azam]] were underway at ICT-1 and the trial of [[Delwar Hossain Sayeedi]] had nearly finished.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt;

On 6 December 2012, the presiding judge of ICT-1, Mohammed Nizamul Huq, passed an order requiring two members of ''The Economist'' to appear before the court, demanding that they explain how they came into possession of e-mails and conversations between him and lawyer Ziauddin. This order came after ''The Economist'' contacted Huq about the material they had. The order named Ahmed Ziauddin as an expert assisting the judges, explaining that the judges needed research support as the tribunal is based on new law.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Discrepancy in Dhaka |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2012/12/bangladesh |magazine=[[The Economist]] |date=8 December 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December, the newspaper ''Amar Desh'' began publishing reports and transcripts of the conversations, and ''The Economist'' published a further report on 15 December.

==Revelations==
According to ''The Economist'', the Skype conversations and e-mails suggested that the Bangladesh Government pressured and attempted to intervene in the International Crimes Tribunal to speed proceedings up. During a conversation between Huq and Ziauddin on 14 October, Huq referred to the government as
&lt;blockquote&gt;Absolutely crazy for a judgment. The government has gone totally mad. They have gone completely mad, I am telling you. They want a judgment by 16th December ([[Victory Day]])...it's as simple as that.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On 15 October, Huq described how a member of the government "came to visit me this evening. He asked me to pass this verdict fast. I told him 'how can I do that?'... He said, 'Try as quick as you can.'"&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt;

''The Economist'' also reported the communications revealed Brussels-based lawyer Ziauddin's influence in the trial. Between 28 August and 20 October, the two men spoke for the equivalent of almost 20 minutes every day. Ziauddin appeared to help Huq prepare documents. On 12 May, Ziauddin sent Huq a document called "GhulamAzamChargesFinalDraft", and the next day the tribunal issued an identical document as its indictment against Ghulam Azam. Ziauddin also advised Huq on the future of Huq's fellow judge Shahinur Islam, saying, "If he does not stop he has to go as well, because it is so harmful to us."&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt;

''The Economist'' further adds that the conversations reveal that Ziauddin discussed the same issues with the judge and the prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor Zaed-al-Malum. On 11 December 2011 he sent Malum and another prosecutor help on the case against Azam and forwarded this advice to Huq. After the prosecutors laid their charges, Ziauddin continued to advise Huq on the accusations.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype/&gt;

During the conversations, one or both of the men referred to Justice Jahangir Hossain as "corrupt." Before Justice Huq resigned, Hossain gave an emotional speech in court in his own defence (Huq was absent). Hossain objected to Huq and Ziauddin's characterisation of him. He also objected to ''Amar Desh's'' coverage of the Skype conversations. Hossain said he had been appointed to sit on a case that involved Mahmudur Rahman (now editor of Amar Desh) while he had been appointed as Energy Advisor in the BNP government. Hossain said that Rahman should not have included his name in a large headline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 December 2012 |title='I'm honest,' Justice Jahangir Hossain |url=http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=237991&amp;cid=2 |newspaper=bdnews24.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214014424/http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=237991&amp;cid=2 |archive-date=2012-12-14 |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ahmed Ziauddin==
Ahmed Ziauddin is a Bangladeshi lawyer and academic specializing in international courts of law, who lives and works in Brussels, Belgium. He was born in [[Dhaka]], then part of [[East Pakistan]], where he went to college and law school, and his brother was a friend of Mohammed Nizamul Huq. They have known each other for many years.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype3 /&gt; Ziauddin is a professor of international law at [[Catholic University of Brussels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 September 2003 |title=Dhaka, Washington sign pact |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79317987.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=Dhaka |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he is the full-time director of the Bangladesh Centre for Genocide Studies.&lt;ref name=TheDawn&gt;{{cite news |date=13 January 2013 |title=Bangladesh: Centre for Genocide Studies |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/778387/bangladesh-centre-for-genocide-studies |newspaper=Dawn |location=Karachi |accessdate=2013-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center campaigns to end what he has called "the ingrained culture of impunity" regarding the 1971 war crimes in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TheDawn /&gt;

Ziauddin is also known for his advocacy of the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] as he lobbied Asian governments to sign and ratify the treaty&lt;ref name=AZ&gt;{{cite news |last=Ziauddin |first=Ahmed |date=3 July 2008 |title=Bangladesh should ratify ICC statute |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/law/2008/07/03/index.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ziauddin |first=Ahmed |date=12 December 2009 |title=Ratification of the Rome statute |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/law/2009/12/02/index.htm |newspaper=Law and Our Rights (supplement) |publisher=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HindustanTimes&gt;{{cite news |date=20 October 2004 |title=Pak urged to ratify International Criminal Court |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-1073270981.html |newspaper=Hindustan Times |agency=Asian News International |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ziauddin was affiliated since 2001 as coordinator for the Asian Network of the Coalition for the International Criminal Court (CICC) and its efforts to lobby [[United Nations]]-member countries to sign the Rome Statute that established by treaty the [[International Criminal Court]]. He worked to get [[States parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Asian countries]], such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, to sign and then ratify the treaty&lt;ref name="HindustanTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Civil society bodies ask govt to ratify all HR treaties |newspaper=The Nation |location=Lahore |date=20 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dhaka to ratify Rome Statute of int'l court before March |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-116855 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh signed and then ratified in 2010. In that same year, Bangladesh's ratification of the Rome Statute made possible its establishment of Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hasina comes up with new peace model |url=http://www.newstoday.com.bd/?option=details&amp;news_id=39782&amp;date=2011-09-25 |date=25 September 2011 |publisher=News Today |accessdate=2013-04-11}}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His lobbying of Bangladesh for the Rome Treaty was also connected to his desire to see the war crimes trial take place there. He said previous governments in Bangladesh had not dealt with the war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Strangio |first=Sebastian |date=22 July 2010 |title=War crimes and Bangladesh |url=http://thediplomat.com/2010/07/war-crimes-and-bangladesh/ |work=The Dipolomat |accessdate=2012-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that the International Criminal Court did not negate the role of nations; he wrote, "The ICC is only a complimentary court. It is intended to supplement national courts, which are primarily responsible to try war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts of Genocide."&lt;ref name=AZ /&gt; He also said that the Rome Statute would protect the country; he said, "As Bangladesh works to address impunity for past crimes and re-establish the rule of law, joining the ICC will help ensure that grave crimes are not committed in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Global coalition calls on Bangladesh to join ICC |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/law/2009/08/05/news.htm |work=Law &amp; our rights |publisher=The Daily Star |date=29 August 2009 |access-date=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war crimes trial, Ziauddin advised lead Justice Nizamul Huq. He also drafted charges against one of the accused, Ghulam Azam.&lt;ref name=TheDawn /&gt; Weeks before the Skype controversy came to public light, Ziauddin attended a conference at the Assembly of States Parties of the International Criminal Court at The Hague in November 2012 where Toby Cadman, who is the defense attorney for the accused in Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal and the most high-profile critic of the process. Cadman presented a paper that linked the Rome Statute with the problems of the ICT: "lack of transparency; discriminatory intent of the legislation and tribunal; lack of clear definitions of crimes; absence of rules of disclosure; and investigations being conducted under a cloak of secrecy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationallawbureau.com/index.php/prosecution-and-defence-clash-over-standards-of-procedural-fairness-at-the-bangladesh-international-criminal-tribunal/ |title=Prosecution and Defence Clash Over Standards of Procedural Fairness at the Bangladesh International Criminal Tribunal |last=Macpherson |first=Caroline |date=27 November 2012 |publisher=International Criminal Law Bureau  |accessdate=2013-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ziauddin described his professional relationship with Huq in ''The Economist'' as follows:
{{quote|It's up to judges to decide where they are going to get research support or other support they need. They are quite entitled to do it. The more so when they really don’t have that research backup [in Bangladesh]. [They ask for help] if they feel if there are people more informed about the issue, especially where [international law] is so new in Bangladesh ... I’m not really advising him, but if there is a question then I try to respond.&lt;ref name=EconomistSkype /&gt;
}}

After the disclosure of their conversations came to light, Ziauddin was also called before Bangladesh's war crimes court to answer for his participation, a case which is in progress.

==Aftermath==
On 11 December 2012, Huq resigned from his position as chairman of ICT-1, citing personal reasons. Despite demands from Jamaat-e-Islami for the tribunal to be scrapped, the Law Minister Shafique Ahmed said that Huq's resignation would not hamper trial proceedings. He said that Huq had in no way behaved improperly and had the right to consult with experts in the law.&lt;ref name=DSHuq/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ethirajan |first=Anbarasan |date=11 December 2012 |title=Bangladesh war crimes judge Nizamul Huq resigns |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-20677752 |work=BBC News |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December, Fazle Kabir, then head of the second tribunal (ICT-2), was named as the new chairman.&lt;ref name=DSKabir/&gt;

On 19 December, the defence submitted applications for a retrial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 December 2012 |title=Skype row continues to dog ICT-1 |url=http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=238443&amp;cid=37 |newspaper=bdnews24.net |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225160611/http://bdnews24.com/details.php?id=238443&amp;cid=37 |archive-date=2012-12-25 |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A petition was also filed to remove the chief prosecutor Zaed-al-Malum. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, BNP MP on trial at ICT-1, demanded adjournment of his case until the petition was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=20 December 2012 |title=Ghulam Azam seeks retrial |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-261827 |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January, the defendants' applications for retrials were rejected.

The editor of ''Amar Desh,'' Mahmudur Rahman, was arrested on remand on 11 April 2013 for a number of charges, including sedition for publishing the Skype material, as well as other reporting from Amar Desh about the [[2013 Shahbag protests]].
&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; The Asian Human Rights Commission reports that they are informed that Rahman has been tortured in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Detained Editor Tortured in Police Remand |url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-STM-080-2013 |website=Asian Human Rights Commission |accessdate=2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===
[[File:Darlington raceway.svg|thumb|left|Layout of Darlington Raceway, the track where the race will be held.]]
'''Darlington Raceway''' is a [[race track]] built for [[NASCAR]] racing located near [[Darlington, South Carolina]]. It is nicknamed '''"The Lady in Black"''' and '''"The Track Too Tough to Tame"''' by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as "A NASCAR Tradition." It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate. This situation makes it very challenging for the crews to set up their cars' handling in a way that will be effective at both ends.

==Race==
===First half===
Under mostly sunny [[South Carolina]] skies, [[Kevin Harvick]] led the field to the green flag at 6:26&amp;nbsp;p.m. Not much happened during this first run of the race outside of [[Clint Bowyer]] making an unscheduled stop for a flat tire on lap 23. [[Kyle Larson]] started a cycle of green flag stops on lap 47. Harvick retained the lead through the pit cycle. [[Austin Dillon]] and [[Michael McDowell (racing driver)|Michael McDowell]] were black-flagged for speeding and forced to serve a pass through penalty.

It was the same routine the next run of riding around the track until the second round of stops on lap 92. This time, [[Brad Keselowski]] assumed the lead when Harvick pitted. [[Trevor Bayne]] spun out at the entrance of pit road and brought out the first caution of the race on lap 96.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=David|title=NASCAR: Martin Truex Jr. races to Darlington victory|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/nascar-auto-racing/thatsracin/article100016132.html|accessdate=September 7, 2016|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=September 4, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trapped all but Keselowski, [[Chase Elliott]] and [[Ricky Stenhouse Jr.]] a lap or more down. Everyone opted to take the wave-around when the top-three pitted.

The race restarted on lap 103. [[Jimmie Johnson]], who was black-flagged before the caution flew for "illegal body modification," was forced to serve a pass through penalty. The second caution of the race flew on lap 114 after [[Brian Scott]] got loose exiting turn 2 and spun out.

The race restarted on lap 118. Keselowski drove away from the field for a time, but was chased down by Harvick who passed him in turn 2 to retake the lead on lap 141. A number of cars started pitting on lap 162. Harvick was among them and Keselowski assumed the lead. He pitted the next lap and the lead cycled back to Harvick.

The third caution of the race flew on lap 204 for a single-car wreck on the backstretch. Exiting turn 2, [[Tony Stewart]] got alongside Scott and his car got loose. After he recovered his car, he veered back to the right, hooked Scott and sent him into the inside wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bruce|first=Kenny|title=Tony Stewart visits NASCAR hauler post-Darlington|url=http://www.nascar.com/content/nascar/en_us/news-media/articles/2016/9/4/tony-stewart-called-nascar-hauler-brian-scott-wreck.html|website=NASCAR.com|publisher=NASCAR Media Group, LLC.|accessdate=September 7, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]|date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We were just in a bad situation ... I was trying to let Tony go," Scott said. "Apparently he got mad at me. I have a lot of respect for Tony. He's always raced me really clean. I am not sure what he thought was going on there. I am not sure if he thought I was trying to hold him up there, I wasn’t. I was trying to let him go. I even pointed him to the inside. Maybe he thought I was giving him the finger or something. I will talk with him. We will figure it out.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pistone|first=Pete|authorlink=Pete Pistone|title=Stewart and Scott Tangle|url=http://www.mrn.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup/News/Articles/2016/09/Tony-Stewart-and-Brian-Scott-Tangle-at-Darlington.aspx|website=MRN.com|publisher=[[Motor Racing Network]]|accessdate=September 7, 2016|date=September 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart was called to the NASCAR hauler after the race for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Utter|first=Jim|title=Tony Stewart called to meeting with NASCAR for incident|url=http://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/tony-stewart-called-to-meeting-with-nascar-for-incident-video-815856/|website=[[Motorsport.com]]|publisher=Motorsport Network, LLC.|accessdate=September 7, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]|date=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denied intentionally wrecking him, saying afterwards that he was "on old tires and sliding around. I got underneath him in [Turn] 2 and for some reason, he ran us through there [beside us] and I got really loose, and I was still getting it gathered up and got him in the left rear and wrecked him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pockrass|first=Bob|title=Tony Stewart denies purposely wrecking Brian Scott at Darlington|url=http://www.espn.com/racing/story/_/id/17467630/tony-stewart-blames-old-tires-wreck-brian-scott|website=[[ESPN.com]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=September 7, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]|date=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second half===
The race restarted on lap 211. The fourth caution of the race flew on lap 213 after Johnson got loose exiting turn 4, spun down the track and hit the inside wall on the frontstretch.

The race restarted on lap 218. The fifth caution of the race flew on lap 249 after [[Jeffrey Earnhardt]] slammed the wall in turn 4. [[Denny Hamlin]] exited pit road with the race lead.

The race restarted on lap 255. The sixth caution of the race flew on lap 260 for [[Greg Biffle]] hitting the wall in turn 4. [[Matt Kenseth]] opted not to pit under the caution and assumed the race lead.

The race restarted on lap 265. Harvick drove by Kenseth to retake the lead with 94 laps to go. The seventh caution of the race flew with 87 laps to go for a two-car wreck in turn 2 involving [[A. J. Allmendinger]] and [[Ryan Blaney]]. Hamlin exited pit road with the race lead.

The race restarted with 83 laps to go. Larson got a great restart and took the lead from Hamlin with 82 laps to go. Oil left on the track that came from the expired engine of Stewart's No. 14 car brought out the eighth caution of the race with 48 laps to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bezjak|first=Lou|title=Darlington isn’t too tough for Truex to tame|url=http://www.thestate.com/sports/nascar-auto-racing/article100015307.html|accessdate=September 7, 2016|work=[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=September 4, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The race restarted with 45 laps to go. The ninth caution of the race flew with 39 laps to go for a two-car wreck on the backstretch. Rounding turn 2, [[Paul Menard]] suffered a left-rear tire blowout, got loose, clipped [[Kurt Busch]] and sent him backwards into the wall. He continued down the track hitting the inside wall head on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hembree|first=Mike|title=Martin Truex Jr. wins at Darlington|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2016/09/04/martin-truex-jr-wins-darlington/89874872/|accessdate=September 7, 2016|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=September 5, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] opted not to pit and assumed the lead along with [[Brad Keselowski]] who also stayed out.

The race restarted with 34 laps to go. [[Martin Truex Jr.]] passed Newman for the lead with 27 laps to go. Harvick reeled him in to take the lead just as the 10th caution of the race flew for a two-car wreck in turn 2 involving [[Aric Almirola]] and Bowyer. Truex exited pit road with the race lead.

The race restarted with 12 laps to go.

===Post-race===
====Driver comment====
Truex said in victory lane that the win was "just – this is unbelievable. So many people to thank obviously. I’ve always loved this race track. I’ve led a lot of laps here in my career. I feel like just something always happened and just so proud to get to victory lane with this group. The pit crew was flawless tonight. They won us the race. They took a lot of heat from last week with what happened. I’m glad he’s (Ryan Newman) not riding home with me – he’d be waiting a while. But just a big weekend for us to – we’ve had a terrible string of back luck. We’ve had super-fast race cars. Auto-Owners Insurance, this is their second race with us and one more with us this year and really excited for them. They went a little retro. I’ve got my zoot suit. This is something here that’s really special to us – I ran this wheel today and it’s real special to take that thing to victory lane. We do a lot with our foundation for ovarian and pediatric cancer. It’s awareness month for both of those diseases, so big day for us there, but just can’t say enough about this team and Barney Visser (team owner) and Toyota and TRD (Toyota Racing Development) – the engines have been unbelievable this year – and Bass Pro Shops and Furniture Row, Denver Mattress and everybody that’s made this possible. Cole Pearn (crew chief) and these guys are just amazing. I knew when the bad luck would stop coming we’d start racking them off. We do a lot with our foundation for ovarian and pediatric cancer. It’s awareness month for both of those diseases, so big day for us there, but just can’t say enough about this team and Barney Visser (team owner) and Toyota and TRD (Toyota Racing Development) – the engines have been unbelievable this year – and Bass Pro Shops and Furniture Row, Denver Mattress and everybody that’s made this possible. Cole Pearn (crew chief) and these guys are just amazing. I knew when the bad luck would stop coming we’d start racking them off and tonight we weren’t the best car for once and we actually won, so that was really cool and just couldn’t be more excited to win at Darlington, the Southern 500. I’ve been wanting to win this thing a long time and got to thank Sprint, the fans were great – tons of fans here today – and really excited. Glad they stuck around for a good finish and I don’t know – I could go on and on for hours I guess. Well, it just was frustrating to lead laps here throughout my career and even in years when we didn’t run that well at teams I was on, we seemed to run well here and felt like we let a few slip away. It was worth the wait for sure, so we’ll do some celebrating tonight and just can’t thank everybody enough again – everybody at (Joe) Gibbs (Racing), all those guys, great teammates – just so many people I need to thank. The pit crew – man, I can’t say it enough, what a job they did tonight. I appreciate them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Tucker|title=Truex wins the Southern 500|url=http://www.speedwaymedia.com/?p=114682|website=SpeedwayMedia.com|publisher=USA Today Sports Digital Properties|accessdate=September 7, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]|date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a series of bad pit stops relegated Harvick, who led a race high of 214 laps, to a runner-up finish, he said that he lost the race because of "the same old thing. You get into position where you bring a dominant car. The guys in the shop and the guys in the garage are doing a great job. The guys on pit road are doing a terrible job. You get into position to win races and they continually step on their toes and don’t make it happen.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long|first=Dustin|title=Frustrations boil after pit road problems keep Kevin Harvick out of victory lane again|url=http://nascar.nbcsports.com/2016/09/05/frustrations-boil-after-pit-road-problems-keep-kevin-harvick-out-of-victory-lane-again/|website=NASCARTalk.NBCSports.com|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|accessdate=September 7, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]|date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his post-race media availability, he went further saying he's "over being a cheerleader. Those guys get paid a lot of money to perform on pit road and cheerleading hasn’t really been working. You’ve got to get after it on pit road and do your job.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Catanzareti|first=Zach|title=Kevin Harvick ‘Done Being Cheerleader’ After Another Pit Road Mishap in Darlington|url=https://frontstretch.com/2016/09/04/kevin-harvick-done-being-cheerleader-after-another-pit-road-mishap-in-darlington/|website=Frontstretch.com|publisher=Frontstretch|accessdate=September 7, 2016|location=[[Darlington, South Carolina]]|date=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Penalties====
On the Wednesday following the race, Larson and Newman – whose cars failed post-race inspection – were docked 15 points each, and their crew chiefs were both fined over $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fryer|first=Jenna|title=Newman's title chances take hit following NASCAR penalty|url=http://racing.ap.org/article/newmans-title-chances-take-hit-following-nascar-penalty|accessdate=September 8, 2016|work=Associated Press|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=AP Sports|date=September 7, 2016|location=[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{A1 Grand Prix}}

'''A1 Grand Prix''' ('''A1GP''') was a 'single make' [[Open-wheel car|open wheel]] [[auto racing]] series that ran from 2005 until 2009. It was unique in its field in that competitors solely represented their [[nation]] as opposed to themselves or a team, the usual format in most [[formula racing]] series. As such, it was often promoted as the "[[World cup competition|World Cup]] of Motorsport". The series was ratified by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)]] and races were held in the traditional Formula One off-season, the northern hemisphere winter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1gp.com/About/WhatIsA1GP.aspx What is A1 Grand Prix?] A1GP official website&lt;/ref&gt; The nation-based A1GP concept was founded by [[Maktoum Hasher Maktoum Al Maktoum|Sheikh Maktoum Hasher Maktoum Al Maktoum]] of [[Dubai]], initially in 2003.&lt;ref name="A1GP History"&gt;[http://www.a1gp.com/(S(s3nn5d55u4a2ta45yonq3uz4))/About/A1GPhistory.aspx A1GP History] ''a1gp.com''&lt;/ref&gt; After a successful first season of A1GP, it was announced on 29 September 2006 that Maktoum was to sell his position as Chairman &amp; Director of A1GP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1gp.com/news/index.php?flashNavId=1&amp;newsid=377 Official A1GP Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer of his share in the organisation of A1 Grand Prix to RAB Capital was finalized in December 2006. [[Tony Teixeira]] took control of the series in 2006, leading it to [[liquidation]] by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crash.net/A1GP/news/149145/1/series_in_doubt_after_liquidation.html "Series in doubt after liquidation,"], crash.net, 30 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The nation-based A1GP concept was founded by [[Maktoum Hasher Maktoum Al Maktoum|Sheikh Maktoum Hasher Maktoum Al Maktoum]] of [[Dubai]], initially in 2003.&lt;ref name="A1GP History"/&gt; Once the series had received the backing of the FIA, a management structure including new executive directors [[Brian Menell]] and [[Tony Teixeira]] were appointed to oversee the sale of franchises for the operation of international teams. Thirty franchises were made available; twenty-three of them were restricted to specified nations, while the other seven were opened to tender for nations that had not been initially targeted.

===First season===
{{main|2005–06 A1 Grand Prix season}}

Twenty-five of the franchises were purchased in time for the [[2005–06 A1 Grand Prix season]], which began on 25 September 2005 with the [[2005–06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain|A1 Grand Prix of Nations Great Britain]] at the [[Brands Hatch]] circuit in [[Kent]], United Kingdom. The first season was planned for 12 rounds (24 races, with two each weekend); however the cancellation of a race scheduled for [[Curitiba]], [[Brazil]] in January 2006 reduced this number to 11. [[Nelson Piquet, Jr.]] won the inaugural race of the series for [[A1 Team Brazil]]. Their winning form was not to continue. Wins at [[Estoril]] and [[Sepang International Circuit|Malaysia]] saw [[A1 Team France]] build up a sizeable gap. By the start of the winter break, France had run away with the lead with [[A1 Team Switzerland]] 28 points behind. At the final race of the season in [[Shanghai]], A1 Team France were crowned the first-ever A1 Grand Prix world champions with 172 points. Switzerland were second with 121 points and [[A1 Team Great Britain]] third with 97 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/results.php?s=201&amp;y=2005&amp;c=1|title=A1 Grand Prix results for 2005–06 | work=Autosport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Katherine Legge]] was the first woman to drive [[A1 Grand Prix cars]] during test session in December 2005 on [[Dubai Autodrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racerchicks.com/news/M_Legge.html Katherine Legge to Test A1GP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023065547/http://racerchicks.com/news/M_Legge.html |date=2007-10-23 }} ''racerchicks.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second season===
{{main|2006–07 A1 Grand Prix season}}

Changes were made for the 2006–07 season to race durations and distances to improve the spectacle for attendees and TV viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=27843 "A1 Grand Prix makes plans for the 2006–07 season"], A1GP official website, 14 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006–07 schedule was released on 7 July 2006, with the first race at [[Circuit Park Zandvoort]] on 1 October 2006, and the last race at Brands Hatch on 29 April 2007. New teams [[A1 Team Singapore|Team Singapore]] and [[A1 Team Greece|Team Greece]] joined the competition but [[A1 Team Turkey|Team Turkey]] failed to secure funding for the season. [[A1 Team Austria|Team Austria]], [[A1 Team Japan|Team Japan]], [[A1 Team Portugal|Team Portugal]] and [[A1 Team Russia|Team Russia]] did not return for the second season. However, after securing funding Team Portugal competed in the final four rounds of the second season in South Africa, Mexico, China and Britain. Team Germany won the series with 128 points, 35 points lead ahead of Team New Zealand.

On 29 September, Sheikh Maktoum announced he was resigning his position as chairman and chief executive of the series, seeking to have his place taken by increased shareholder interests:
{{cquote|I am happy that I have built the series with fans in mind. I feel like I have fulfilled my promise to them by bringing A1GP from concept to reality and am confident that the World Cup of Motorsport will go from strength to strength. Having devoted all my efforts to making A1GP the success it is today, this transaction will allow me to devote more time to my Dubai International Holding Company which currently manages a substantial portfolio of assets and new ventures and which continues to actively pursue other significant investment opportunities.}}
Maktoum announced his intended resignation in September and his exit from the organisation was confirmed in December.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=27597 "A1GP and Sheikh Maktoum bid farewell"] A1GP official website, 29 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=30200 "Sheikh Maktoum Exits A1GP In Deal With RAB Capital"] A1GP official website, 10 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third season===
[[File:Sepang International Circuit A1 Race.JPG|thumb|Sepang International Circuit A1 Race]]
{{main|2007–08 A1 Grand Prix season}}

===Fourth season===
{{main|2008–09 A1 Grand Prix season}}

The 2008–09 season was the first season in which the new "Powered by Ferrari" A1GP car was used. According to 2007–08 champion Neel Jani, 90% of teams in the paddock warned Teixeira ahead of time that this car change was untimely and an inefficient use of funds.&lt;ref name="Jani trauert der A1GP-Serie nach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsport-total.com/formelsport/news/2010/06/Jani_trauert_der_A1GP-Serie_nach_10062401.html|title=Jani trauert der A1GP-Serie nach|accessdate=24 June 2010|author=Roman Wittemeier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rule changes included shorter qualifying sessions, a pit-stop during the now longer Sprint Race, removal of limits on Friday test drivers, and reduced Sprint Race points scoring.&lt;ref name="New 08/09 Rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=41852|title=Rule changes for new season|accessdate=11 August 2008|author=a1gp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fifth season===
{{main|2009–10 A1 Grand Prix season}}

The opening round of the season, scheduled as part of the already well established [[Nikon SuperGP]] race meeting, was cancelled five days before practice was due to begin. With cars and series infrastructure still tied up in London and no comment forthcoming from A1GP, organisers in Australia were forced to announce the series would not appear at what had been a high-profile addition to the A1 Grand Prix calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mival |first=Al |title=V8 Supercars to replace scrapped event as A1GP cars fail to show |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26222254-10389,00.html |publisher=Courier Mail |date=17 October 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091020083300/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C23739%2C26222254-10389%2C00.html |archivedate=20 October 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The event was underwritten by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland state government]], who  mentioned the possibility of taking legal recourse against A1 Grand Prix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Greg Stolz and David Murray |title=A1GP race cars still in UK as Gold Coast event in limbo |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,26220533-3102,00.html |publisher=Courier Mail |date=17 October 2009 |accessdate=17 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112090311/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C23739%2C26220533-3102%2C00.html |archivedate=12 November 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was thrown into further doubt as more races were cancelled, with an announcement made on 5 November 2009 stating that the races in China and Malaysia would not be taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vince Pettit |title=A1GP – The final nail in the coffin? |url=http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2009/11/a1gp-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin |publisher=thecheckeredflag.co.uk |date=5 November 2009|accessdate=5 November 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091116122621/http://www.thecheckeredflag.co.uk/2009/11/a1gp-the-final-nail-in-the-coffin| archivedate= 16 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The last race that was to be held in the season, the Dutch round, was switched for [[Superleague Formula]]. This put an end to the hopes the season would start and also put the future of the series in doubt.

==Teams==
{{main|List of A1 Grand Prix teams}}
Each A1 Grand Prix team represented a nation. Drivers must have the same nationality as the team they drove for. The team car should also represent the country. The team owner, principal and crew, however, did not need to have the same nationality as the team.

{{Main|List of A1 Grand Prix drivers}}

==Race weekend==
A1 Grands Prix of Nations took place over a three-day period, from Friday to Sunday. The teams were given five sets of dry weather [[slick tire]]s, and two sets of wet weather [[tread|treaded tires]] per weekend. However, if the weather was extreme, the team could be given more wet weather tires at the expense of the slick tires. The race weekend started with two one-hour practice sessions held on the Friday, and then another on the Saturday morning. A two-hour qualifying session took place on Saturday afternoon, and two races took place on Sunday. Primarily, the three practice sessions were for car setup and track familiarisation before the official competition began with Saturday qualifying. Three different drivers could participate in the three practice sessions; the driver elected for qualifying or for one of the races was required to have taken part in at least one such practice session.

===Qualifying===
A1 Grand Prix used a unique qualifying format, which began at 14:00 local time on the Saturday of the race weekend, to determine the grid lineup for Sunday's races, the Sprint Race and the Main Race. The qualifying period was split into four, ten-minute sessions.&lt;ref name="New 08/09 Rules" /&gt; Each car was permitted three laps per session, including the laps required for leaving the pits, and for re-entering it. This allowed one lap to set a competitive time. There was a five-minute break between sessions, which added up to a total of 55 minutes for qualifying. The grid for the Sprint Race was set based on the cars' fastest time from either the first or the second session. The grid for the Feature Race was determined the same way, but using sessions three and four. However, if there was a red flag due to an accident on the circuit, the timing to the end of qualifying continued to run.

===Sprint race===
The Sprint Race used the grid determined in sessions one and two of the previous day's qualifying session, and was held in the early afternoon. The race began from a [[rolling start]], and its duration was a maximum of 24 minutes plus one additional lap.&lt;ref name="New 08/09 Rules" /&gt; Additionally, each team had to make one mandatory pit stop between laps four and eight.&lt;ref name="New 08/09 Rules" /&gt; Drivers were permitted four uses of [[A1 Grand Prix cars#PowerBoost|PowerBoost]] during the Sprint Race.

|}

===Feature race===
The Feature Race used the grid determined in sessions three and four of the previous day's qualifying session, and was held mid-afternoon. The race began from a [[standing start]], and was a race of approximately {{convert|180|km}}, with a maximum time limit of 69 minutes plus one lap. Teams had to make two mandatory pit stops during the Feature Race, one between laps eight and sixteen, and another during a pit window, which was not announced until the first window has closed. Drivers were permitted eight uses of [[A1 Grand Prix cars#PowerBoost|PowerBoost]] during the Feature Race.

====Pit stop====
Each team had to complete three compulsory [[pit stop]]s over the course of the race weekend – one during the Sprint Race, and two during the Feature Race.&lt;ref name="New 08/09 Rules" /&gt; During the pit stop, all four tyres on the car had to be changed. A total of eight mechanics could be used during the stop, however, only four were allowed to 'touch the car', none of which (save the so-called "lollipop man" that directed the car into its pit) could be present in the pit lane before the car came to a complete halt. Refuelling was also not permitted; infringements of these rules or of the pit-lane [[speed limit]] resulted in the imposition of a drive-through penalty.

At the end of Season 3, A1GP released the results of the season's pit stop times. Although having never won a race, [[A1 Team Australia]] had the fastest pit crew of all teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=41731|title=Who were the pit stop kings?|accessdate=31 July 2008|author=a1gp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring===
Unlike almost all other forms of auto racing, drivers did not score points individually; instead the points they earn were ascribed to their national team. This means that teams could change drivers between rounds, which was often necessary because some drivers had commitments in other formulae, and still accumulate points to their score.

Points were awarded for the first ten places but the amounts changed during the series' run: 15 for the winner, 12 for second place, 10 for third place, 8 for fourth place, 6 for fifth place, 5 for sixth place, and so on with 4, 3, 2, and one point for tenth place. Points were awarded in a different way for the Sprint Race: 10 for the winner, counting down 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 point for eighth place.&lt;ref name="New 08/09 Rules" /&gt; In addition, one point was awarded to the team that set the fastest single lap time in either the Sprint or Main Race. Cash prizes were also awarded.

Below is a list of pointscoring systems used to determine the winner of the A1 Grand Prix World Cup of Motorsport since the [[2005–06 A1 Grand Prix season|2005–06 season]]. The World Cup of Motorsport was awarded to the [[List of A1 Grand Prix teams|A1 Grand Prix team]] which accumulated the most points over the course of a season.

==Chassis and engines==
[[File:A1GP Ferrari car.jpg|thumb|The "Powered by Ferrari" A1 Grand Prix car in global livery]]
{{main|A1 Grand Prix car}}

The A1GP formula provided a single "spec" car for each team. Each car was mechanically identical, built with many technical restrictions designed to limit performance, reduce running costs, and prevent any one or number of teams gaining an advantage through better equipment. This regulation provided a level playing field in which driver skill and team effort should become the primary factor for success.

Specifically, the cars had a carbon fibre monocoque with an aluminium honeycomb core [[chassis]] based on the [[Formula One]] [[Ferrari F2004]] chassis, riding on control [[slick tire]]s from [[Michelin]]. The 4.5-litre [[Ferrari/Maserati engine|Ferrari/Maserati]] V8 engine was capable of delivering up to {{convert|600|bhp|kW}} in [[A1 Grand Prix cars#PowerBoost|PowerBoost]] mode – a mechanism to provide short bursts of increased power to create additional overtaking opportunities and action throughout the race.

==Broadcasters==
[[Richard Dorfman]] was the A1GP's director of broadcasting.

==2006 A1 Grand Prix incident==
{{main|2006–07 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Beijing, China}}

The first Chinese round of the 2006–07 A1GP took place on the streets of [[Beijing International Streetcircuit|Beijing]]. However, the tight hairpin at the end of the back straight was too tight for the cars to negotiate safely, as it was a 180 degree left turn. Cars were running wide and stopping mid corner; therefore, the sessions were red flagged.

A shorter circuit was created, creating another, less tight hairpin halfway up the straight, bypassing most of the old straight. This corner was still not ideal, as drivers ran wide despite the corner being wider and had to avoid the pitlane entry barrier. It had to suffice, though, as otherwise the race would have been cancelled.

However, another problem arose in qualifying when [[manhole]] covers on the roads were coming undone due to the racing cars' high downforce and low ride height. Grid positions were decided based on practice times. Some advertising banners also came loose around the circuit.

It was announced that the races would start behind the safety car, as the first corner was also deemed unsafe.

Both races were uneventful, particularly the Sprint Race, which took place almost entirely behind the safety car after course officials failed to remove a single spun car in a timely fashion.

==Series collapse and liquidation==
Chairman [[Tony Teixeira]] announced in October 2007 that Italian manufacturer [[Ferrari]] would design and build the engines for six years, and that Ferrari would consult in the design and manufacture of the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=39186 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416231449/http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=39186&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=16 April 2009 |title=Ferrari joins A1GP |website=A1GP |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ferrari involvement was intended to ease some of the concerns regarding A1GP's ongoing financial viability, the continued input of existing backers, and the platform's ability to attract sponsors. CEO Pete da Silva reported a loss for the initial season, and yet RAB Capital paid $200 million to the exiting Dubai founder for his 80% stake. Before the 2008–09 "Powered by Ferrari" season was to begin, Bloomberg reported that RAB Capital announced that the A1GP investment had been written down for a third time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=a8AcWcq843_A&amp;refer=uk "RAB Tries to Halt Redemptions After Loss on Racing Investment "], Bloomberg, 10 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A1 Team Australia boss Alan Jones later suggested that "it is common knowledge that Mr Teixeira bought RAB Capital out from A1GP" before the current season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldcoast.com.au/article/2008/11/17/23471_gold-coast-indy.html "A1GP Boss Denies Financial woes"], Goldcoast, 17 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; yet A1GP prominently displayed RAB Capital branding until A1GP discontinued racing operations in 2009.

Following doubts that the fifth season would go ahead due to financial constraints and reports that engine suppliers Ferrari would pull out over non-payments, Teixeira announced that the series had secured its long-term future, following a financial restructuring. As part of the restructuring, administration had been applied for the previously liquidated A1 Grand Prix Operations Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=44488&amp;langCode=EN&amp;teamId=1|title=A1GP.com|publisher=A1 Grand Prix|date=25 September 2009|accessdate=26 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dispute over the ownership of the series' cars was heard on 18 January 2010 at the [[High Court of Justice]] in [[London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Glenn (ed.)|date=14 January 2010|title=Pit &amp; Paddock: Future hangs on court decision|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=199|issue=2|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a judicial decision on 21 January 2010 ruling that the Administrator, Tim Bramston, had won the case with A1 Holdings. The assets were awarded to A1 Grand Prix Operations, and therefore Bramston became their administrator. Bramston said he was trying to secure the best price in liquidation and would not rule out a sale to an entity controlled by Teixeira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.autoweek.com/article/20100128/MOTORSPORTS/100129928 |title= A1GP to be sold |work= autoweek.com |publisher= Autoweek |date= 28 January 2010 |accessdate= 28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RAB Capital's Special Situations fund missed out on the market recovery of 2009 and its shareholders forced manager RAB to allow the entire fund to be put up for sale through a [[Dutch auction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b669b646-20cd-11df-b920-00144feab49a.html "Battered RAB Capital to auction prize fund"], ft.com, 24 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

While the A1GP liquidators were apparently selling all intellectual property rights along with cars,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2258571/a1-goes-liquidation-seeking "A1GP goes into liquidation, but seeking buyers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228034438/http://www.accountancyage.com/accountancyage/news/2258571/a1-goes-liquidation-seeking |date=2010-02-28 }}, accountancyage.com, 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it is unclear if a buyer was also expected to assume franchise agreements and financial obligations, or if the series and its necessary operating entities could be bought free and clear of any and all claims by Teixeira, Lyndhurst, and RAB. The liquidators appointed GoIndustry DoveBid to handle the sale of the assets,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.go-dove.com/event-14131/A1GP_-_Opportunity_to_acquire_Grand_Prix_race_cars_powered_by_Ferrari "GoIndustry DoveBid A1GP Sale"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325192820/http://www.go-dove.com/event-14131/A1GP_-_Opportunity_to_acquire_Grand_Prix_race_cars_powered_by_Ferrari |date=2010-03-25 }}, ''go-dove.com''&lt;/ref&gt; and the liquidators are seeking £10 million for the assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watkins|first=Gary (ed.)|date=2010-04-01|title=Pit &amp; Paddock: £10 million tag put on A1|journal=[[Autosport]]|volume=200|issue=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a revival plan for the series could not be agreed with interested investment parties then the A1 Grand Prix assets were to be put up for auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.italiaracing.net/notizia.asp?id=26850&amp;cat=34 |title=Quattro settimane per il futuro dell'A1GP |trans-title=Four weeks to the future of A1GP |publisher=Italiaracing.Net |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014 |language=it |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309052920/http://www.italiaracing.net/notizia.asp?id=26850&amp;cat=34 |archive-date=2012-03-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2010 [[Autosport magazine]]  published in its "rumours &amp; speculation" blog that the series, in one form or another, was to be revived for a new 2011–12 season, citing an unidentified source who claims backing from a group of new investors. The season would constitute 18 countries making up the grid and ten race weekends, spread out either side of Christmas 2011, visiting many of the series' previous venues. The series would also run under a new model, similar to the [[GP2 Series]] whereby teams are responsible for finding their own funding.&lt;ref name="autosport.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/grapevine.php/id/85015 |title=A1GP could be resurrected |first=Andy |last=Van De Burgt |work=Autosport |date=5 July 2010 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 rumours surfaced of A1GP's potential return with a new name. The series was to be called the A10 World Series, keeping the A1 from A1GP to signify the continuation of the idea. The series was billed as a Global single seater series with 600BHP V10 engines. A source told Autosport magazine that the A10 World Series would use A1GP's idea of pitting countries against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/89003 |title=A1GP concept set for revival |first=Gary |last=Watkins |work=Autosport |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the holding company for the series was formally dissolved in early 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.duedil.com/company/07418408/a10-world-series-limited |title=A10 World Series Limited, Hampshire |publisher=[[Duedil]] |date= |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 ISRA (International Sport Racing Association) took 2005–08 A1 Grand Prix racing cars (Lola-Zytek) and created a single-seater competition named [[Formula Acceleration 1]], which was part of [[Acceleration 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/109953 |first=Gary |last=Watkins |title=A1GP cars to top new race bill |publisher=[[Autosport]] |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eurotux S.A. |url=http://autosport.pt/autodromo-internacional-do-algarve-divulga-calendario=f118307 |title=Autódromo Internacional do Algarve divulga calendário |trans-title=Autódromo Internacional do Algarve discloses calendar |publisher=Autosport.pt |date=10 February 2014 |accessdate=17 June 2014 |language=pt |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221181612/http://autosport.pt/autodromo-internacional-do-algarve-divulga-calendario=f118307 |archivedate=21 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 AFRIX Motorsport of South Africa announced that they had purchased the remaining 21 'Powered by Ferrari' A1GP cars – together with their engines and spares, but less engine management electronics and steering wheels – from Delivered on Time, a freight company that had been granted a lien on the vehicles ''in lieu'' of unpaid bills. AFRIX stated that the cars were to form the basis for a one-make series to be run in South Africa during the southern hemisphere summer.&lt;ref name=autosportafrix&gt;{{cite news|author= Watkins, Gary |date= 28 May 2015 |title= Ferrari-powered A1GP cars bought by South African group |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/119206 |work= Autosport.com |publisher= Haymarket Media Group |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150529203139/http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/119206 |archivedate= 29 May 2015 |accessdate= 29 May 2015 |deadurl= no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United Kingdom in the European Union}}

After the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|UK EU membership referendum]] held on 23 June 2016, in which a majority voted to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]], the United Kingdom experienced political and economic upsets, with spillover effects across the rest of the [[European Union]] and the wider world. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], who had campaigned for Remain, announced his resignation on 24 June, triggering a [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Conservative leadership election]], won by Home Secretary [[Theresa May]]. Following [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s loss of a [[motion of no confidence]] among the [[Parliamentary Labour Party]], he also faced a [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|leadership challenge]], which he won. [[Nigel Farage]] stepped down from leadership of the pro-Leave party [[UKIP]] in July. After the elected party leader resigned, Farage then became the party's interim leader on 5 October until [[Paul Nuttall]] was [[UK Independence Party leadership election, November 2016|elected leader]] on 28 November.

Voting patterns in the referendum varied between areas: [[Gibraltar]], [[Greater London]], many other cities, [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] had majorities for Remain; the remainder of England and Wales and most [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist parts of Northern Ireland]] showed Leave majorities.&lt;ref name="Split"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21701257-results-paint-picture-angry-country-divided-class-age-and-region-country-divided/|title=The Brexit vote reveals a country split down the middle |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=24 June 2016|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled concern among [[Scottish nationalism|Scottish]] and [[Irish nationalism|Irish]] nationalists: the [[First Minister of Scotland]] threatened to withhold legislative consent for any withdrawal legislation and has now formally requested permission to hold a [[Proposed second Scottish independence referendum|second Scottish independence referendum]], while the [[deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland]] called for a referendum on a [[united Ireland]]. The [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|status of Gibraltar]] and that [[London independence|of London]] were also questioned.

In late July 2016, the [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]] was told that Cameron had refused to allow the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|Civil Service]] to make plans for Brexit, a decision the committee described as "an act of gross negligence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/david-cameron-accused-gross-negligence-brexit-contingency-plans|title=Cameron accused of 'gross negligence' over Brexit contingency plans|work=The Guardian|first=Patrick |last=Wintour|date=20 July 2016|accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic effects==
{{main|Economic effects of Brexit}}

Economic arguments were a major element of the referendum debate.  Remainers, including the UK treasury, argued trade would be worse off outside the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-treasury-analysis-the-long-term-economic-impact-of-eu-membership-and-the-alternatives|title=HM Treasury analysis: the long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brexit and the UK's Public Finances|journal=Institute for Fiscal Studies|date=May 2016|issue=IFS Report 116|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/uploads/publications/comms/r116.pdf|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of withdrawal argued that the cessation of net contributions to the EU would allow for some cuts to taxes or increases in government spending.&lt;ref name=JR14042016TGEABLEU&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/14/british-austerity-brexit-budget-nhs-disability-benefits-property The end of British austerity starts with Brexit] J.

When the [[London Stock Exchange]] opened on Friday 24 June, the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]] fell from 6338.10 to 5806.13 in the first ten minutes of trading. Near the close of trading on 27 June, the domestically-focused [[FTSE 250 Index]] was down approximately 14% compared to the day before the referendum results were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2016/06/markets-after-referendum |title=Markets after the referendum – Britain faces Project Reality |last=Buttonwood |date=27 June 2016 |website=The Economist |publisher=The Economist Newspaper Limited |access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1 July the FTSE 100 had risen above pre-referendum levels, to a ten-month high representing the index's largest single-week rise since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=1 July 2016 |title=Post-Brexit rebound sees FTSE setting biggest weekly rise since 2011 |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/post-brexit-vote-rebound-sees-071820694.html/ |agency=Reuters|location=London, UK |access-date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July, it officially entered [[bull market]] territory, having risen by more than 20% from its February low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36762631|title=FTSE 100 rises to 11-month high|date=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTSE 250 moved above its pre-referendum level on 27 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/07/27/ftse-100-set-to-open-higher-as-markets-eye-us-fed-rates-decision/|title=FTSE 100 hits one-year high and FTSE 250 erases post-Brexit losses as UK economy grows by 0.6pc|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=27 July 2016|accessdate=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500]], a broader market than the Dow Jones, reached an all-time high on 11 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://next.ft.com/content/771c7bba-3cae-3cce-9591-9135675b4d6c|title=S&amp;P 500 hits record high for first time since '15|newspaper=Financial Times|date=11 July 2016|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the referendum the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]]  published a report funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] which warned that Britain would lose up to £70 billion in reduced economic growth if it didn't retain [[Single Market]] membership with new trade deals unable to make up the difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/08/10/britain-could-be-up-to-70billion-worse-off-if-it-leaves-the-sing/|title=Britain could be up to £70billion worse off if it leaves the Single Market after Brexit, IFS warns|author=Steven Swinford|date=10 August 2016|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of these areas is financial services, which are helped by EU-wide "passporting" for financial products, which the [[Financial Times]] estimates indirectly accounts for up to 71,000 jobs and 10 billion pounds of tax annually&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.https://www.ft.com/content/f60b2d44-8a51-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731 |title=Claim 'hard Brexit' could cost UK£10bn in tax |newspaper=Financial Times |date=4 October 2016 |accessdate=4 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819141428/http://https/ |archivedate=19 August 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are concerns that banks may relocate outside the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37743700 |title=Banks poised to relocate out of UK over Brexit, BBA warns |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2016 |accessdate=24 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 June, Chancellor of the Exchequer [[George Osborne]] attempted to reassure financial markets that the UK economy was not in serious trouble. This came after media reports that a survey by the [[Institute of Directors]] suggested that two-thirds of businesses believed that the outcome of the referendum would produce negative results as well as falls in the value of sterling and the FTSE 100. Some British businesses had also predicted that investment cuts, hiring freezes and redundancies would be necessary to cope with the results of the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Zoe |date=26 June 2016 |title=Firms plan to quit UK as City braces for more post-Brexit losses |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/26/city-of-london-expecting-further-post-brexit-losses-when-trade-reopens |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, UK |access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osborne indicated that Britain was facing the future "from a position of strength" and there was no current need for an emergency Budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-36637732 |title=Osborne: UK economy in a position of strength |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 June 2016 |website=BBC News – Business |publisher=BBC |access-date=27 June 2016 |quote=George Osborne has said the UK is ready to face the future "from a position of strength" and indicated there will be no immediate emergency Budget.}}&lt;/ref&gt; "No-one should doubt our resolve to maintain the fiscal stability we have delivered for this country ... And to companies, large and small, I would say this: the British economy is fundamentally strong, highly competitive and we are open for business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/27/europe/uk-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson/ |title=Brexit: UK government shifts to damage control |last1=Dewan |first1=Angela |last2=McKirdy |first2=Euan |date=27 June 2016 |publisher=CNN |access-date=27 June 2016 |quote=Not since World War II has Britain faced such an uncertain future.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 July [[Philip Hammond]], Osborne's successor as Chancellor, told [[BBC News]] the referendum result had caused uncertainty for businesses, and that it was important to send "signals of reassurance" to encourage investment and spending. He also confirmed there would not be an emergency budget: "We will want to work closely with the governor of the Bank of England and others through the summer to prepare for the Autumn Statement, when we will signal and set out the plans for the economy going forward in what are very different circumstances that we now face, and then those plans will be implemented in the Budget in the spring in the usual way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36792202 |title=Philip Hammond: Financial markets 'rattled' by Leave vote |publisher=BBC News  |date=14 July 2016 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July, the global investment management company [[BlackRock]] predicted the UK would experience a recession in late 2016 or early 2017 as a result of the vote to leave the EU, and that economic growth would slow down for at least five years because of a reduction in investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Hazel |last=Sheffield |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/brexit-will-plunge-the-uk-into-a-recession-in-the-next-year-blackrock-says-a7134616.html |title=Brexit will plunge the UK into a recession in the next year, BlackRock says |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=14 July 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July, the UK-based economic forecasting group [[ITEM club|EY ITEM club]] suggested the country would experience a "short shallow recession" as the economy suffered "severe confidence effects on spending and business"; it also cut its economic growth forecasts for the UK from 2.6% to 0.4% in 2017, and 2.4% to 1.4% for 2018. The group's chief economic adviser, Peter Soencer, also argued there would be more long-term implications, and that the UK "may have to adjust to a permanent reduction in the size of the economy, compared to the trend that seemed possible prior to the vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Zlata |last=Rodionova |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/uk-faces-short-recession-as-brexit-uncertainty-hits-house-prices-consumer-spending-and-jobs-ey-a7142616.html |title=UK faces short recession as Brexit uncertainty hits house prices, consumer spending and jobs, EY predicts |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=18 July 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior City investor Richard Buxton  also argued there would be a "mild recession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robin |last=De Peyer |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/brexit-britain-set-for-recession-as-top-city-figure-warns-leaving-eu-will-be-horrible-a3297781.html |title=Britain 'set for recession' as Richard Buxton calls leaving EU 'horrible' |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=18 July 2016 |accessdate=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) reduced its 2017 economic growth forecast for the UK from 2.2% to 1.3%, but still expected Britain to be the second fastest growing economy in the G7 during 2016; the IMF also reduced its forecasts for world economic growth by 0.1% to 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017, as a result of the referendum, which it said had "thrown a spanner in the works" of global recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Larry |last=Elliott |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jul/19/imf-cuts-uk-growth-forecasts-following-brexit-vote |title=IMF cuts UK growth forecasts following Brexit vote |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 July 2016 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July, a report released by the [[Bank of England]] said that although uncertainty had risen "markedly" since the referendum, it was yet to see evidence of a sharp economic decline as a consequence. However, around a third of contacts surveyed for the report expected there to be "some negative impact" over the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy |last=Meakin |first2=Jill |last2=Ward |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-20/boe-sees-no-sharp-slowing-yet-even-as-brexit-boosts-uncertainty |title=BOE Sees No Sharp Slowing Yet Even as Brexit Boosts Uncertainty |work=Bloomberg News |publisher=Bloomberg |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, following three months of positive economic data after the referendum, commentators suggested that many of the negative statements and predictions promoted from within the "remain" camp had failed to materialise,&lt;ref name="The Times 2016-09-02"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ralph|first=Alex|title=''Rally rewards bravery in the face of Project Fear''|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rally-rewards-bravery-in-the-face-of-project-fear-tkdz2h95n|date=2 September 2016|publisher=The Times|accessdate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by December, analysis began to show that Brexit was having an effect on inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Katie Allen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/21/brexit-economy-referendum-inflation-uk-2017 |title=Brexit economy: inflation surge shows impact of vote finally beginning to bite &amp;#124; Business |publisher=The Guardian |date=22 November 2016 |accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the IMF raised their forecast for the UK economy from 1.5% to 2% for 2017 and from 1.4% to 1.5% for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.sky.com/story/imf-raises-forecast-for-uk-economic-growth-to-2-in-2017-10842188 |title=IMF raises forecast for UK economic growth to 2% in 2017 |publisher=Sky News |date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June, the Conservative Party leader and prime minister, [[David Cameron]], announced that he would resign by October because the Leave campaign had been successful in the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36615028|title=Brexit: David Cameron to quit after UK votes to leave EU|date=24 June 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the Conservative MPs on both sides of the referendum debate had urged him to stay, the [[UK Independence Party|UKIP]] leader, [[Nigel Farage]], called for Cameron to go "immediately".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Brexit: David Cameron to quit after UK votes to leave EU|publisher=BBC New|date=24 June 2015|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36615028|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A leadership election was scheduled for 9 September, with the new leader to be in place before the party's autumn conference on 2 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36640889 |title=New Tory leader 'should be in place by 9 September' |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=28 June 2016 |publisher=BBC News  |access-date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main candidates were predicted to be [[Boris Johnson]], who had been a keen supporter of leaving the EU, and [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]], who had campaigned for Remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/25/theresa-may-emerges-as-stop-boris-tory-leadership-candidate|title=Theresa May emerges as 'Stop Boris' Tory leadership candidate|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 June 2016|author=Rowena Mason|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last-minute candidature by Johnson's former ally [[Michael Gove]] destabilised the race and forced Johnson to stand down; the final two candidates became May and [[Andrea Leadsom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-leadership-andrea-leadsom-emerges-to-rival-theresa-may-a7114916.html|title=Conservative leadership: Andrea Leadsom emerges as pro-Leave rival to Theresa May as Michael Gove fades|date=2 July 2016|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SecondBallot"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36737426|title=Theresa May v Andrea Leadsom in Conservative leader race|publisher=BBC News  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leadsom soon withdrew, leaving May as new party leader and next prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36768148|title=PM-in-waiting Theresa May promises 'a better Britain'|date=11 July 2016|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took office on 13 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kylie |last=MacLellan |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-may-idUKKCN0ZT20C |title=After winning power, Theresa May faces Brexit divorce battle |agency=Reuters |date=13 July 2016 |accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labour===
{{further|Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016}}
The Labour Party leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] faced growing criticism from his [[Parliamentary Labour Party|parliamentary party]] MPs, who had supported remaining within the EU, for poor campaigning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1716177/labour-out-votes-heap-pressure-on-corbyn|title=Labour 'Out' Votes Heap Pressure on Corbyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two Labour MPs submitted a vote of [[no confidence]] in Corbyn on 24 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/uk-politics-36570120|title=Brexit after EU referendum: UK to leave EU and David Cameron quits|accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that there is evidence that Corbyn deliberately sabotaged Labour's campaign to remain part of the EU, despite remain polling favourably among Labour voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36633238|title=Corbyn office 'sabotaged' EU Remain campaign|accessdate= 26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early hours of Sunday 26 June, Corbyn sacked [[Hilary Benn]] (the shadow foreign secretary) for apparently leading a coup against him. This led to a string of Labour MPs quickly resigning their roles in the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Labour in crisis: Tom Watson criticises Hilary Benn sacking|work=The Guardian|author=Asthana A |author2=Syal, R.|accessdate=26 June 2016|date=26 June 2016|url=http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/labour-in-crisis-tom-watson-criticises-hilary-benn-sacking/ar-AAhDKv3?li=BBoPWjQ&amp;ocid=SL5MDHP}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-afternoon on 27 June 2016, 23 of the Labour Party's 31 shadow cabinet members had resigned from the shadow cabinet as had seven parliamentary private secretaries. On 27 June 2016, Corbyn filled some of the vacancies and was working to fill the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Jeremy Corbyn's new-look shadow cabinet |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/28/labour-crisis-vote-jeremy-corbyn-leadership-david-cameron-brexit/ |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London, UK |date=27 June 2016 |access-date=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a source quoted by the BBC, the party's Deputy Leader [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson]] told leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] that "it looks like we are moving towards a leadership election." Corbyn stated that he would run again in that event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36638041 |title=Corbyn told he faces leadership fight as resignations continue |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=27 June 2016 |publisher=BBC News  |access-date=27 June 2016 |quote=Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has told Jeremy Corbyn he has "no authority" among Labour MPs and warned him he faces a leadership challenge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A no confidence motion was held on 28 June 2016; Corbyn lost the motion with more than 80% (172) of MPs voting against him with a turnout of 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jeremy Corbyn Loses Vote of No Confidence|publisher=Sky News|date=28 June 2016|access-date=28 June 2016|url=http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/jeremy-corbyn-loses-vote-of-no-confidence/ar-AAhJ3KO?li=BBoPWjQ&amp;ocid=SL5MDHP|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701173053/http://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/jeremy-corbyn-loses-vote-of-no-confidence/ar-AAhJ3KO?li=BBoPWjQ&amp;ocid=SL5MDHP|archivedate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corbyn responded with a statement that the motion had no "constitutional legitimacy" and that he intended to continue as the elected leader. The vote does not require the party to call a leadership election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZE11Y |title=EU leaders tell Britain to exit swiftly, market rout halts |last1=Holden |first1=Michael |last2=Piper |first2=Elizabeth |date=28 June 2016 |agency=Reuters |access-date=28 June 2016 |quote=the confidence vote does not automatically trigger a leadership election and Corbyn, who says he enjoys strong grassroots support, refused to quit.

Supporting Corbyn, [[John McDonnell]] said, "We're not going to be bullied by Labour MPs who refuse to accept democracy in our party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36667795 | title=Corbyn to face Labour leadership challenge from Angela Eagle | publisher=BBC | date=29 June 2016 | accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July, [[Angela Eagle]] announced her campaign for the Labour party leadership after attaining enough support of MPs to trigger a leadership contest, saying that she "can provide the leadership that Corbyn can't".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36761370|title=Labour leadership: Angela Eagle says she can unite the party|date=11 July 2016|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eagle subsequently dropped out of the race (on 18 July) leaving [[Owen Smith (politician)|Owen Smith]] as the only contender to [[Jeremy Corbyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grice |first=Andrew |date=19 July 2016 |title=Labour leadership election: Angela Eagle pulls out of contest to allow Owen Smith straight run at Jeremy Corbyn |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/angela-eagle-pulls-out-labour-leadership-election-owen-smith-jeremy-corbyn-a7145021.html |newspaper=The Independent |location=London, UK |access-date=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith had supported the campaign for Britain to [[Britain Stronger in Europe|remain]] in the [[European Union]], in the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum on Britain's membership]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35616946|title=EU vote: Where the cabinet and other MPs stand|date=22 June 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July 2016, following the vote to [[United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union|leave]] the EU, three weeks prior, he pledged that he would press for an early general election or offer a further referendum on the final 'Brexit' deal drawn up by the [[Theresa May|new prime minister]], were he to be elected [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/owen-smith-to-offer-referendum-on-brexit-deal-if-elected-labour-leader|title=Owen Smith to offer referendum on Brexit deal if elected Labour leader|date=13 July 2016|authors=Anushka Asthana, Heather Stewart|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately two weeks later, Smith told the BBC that (in his view) those who had voted with the Leave faction had done so "because they felt a sense of loss in their communities, decline, cuts that have hammered away at vital public services and they haven't felt that any politicians, certainly not the politicians they expect to stand up for them..." His recommendation was to "put in place concrete policies that will bring real improvements to people's lives so I'm talking about a British New Deal for every part of Britain..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-36860780 |title=Owen Smith on Corbyn, leadership, devolution and Brexit |last=Cornock |first=David |date=21 July 2016 |publisher=BBC Wales |access-date=25 July 2016 |quote=said voters backed Brexit because they didn't feel the Labour Party stood up for them,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal Democrats===
The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Lib Dems]], who are a strongly [[pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] party, announced that they respect the referendum result, but would make remaining in the EU a [[Party platform|manifesto]] pledge at the next election.&lt;ref name="Farron"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/lib-dems-pledge-british-return-eu-next-general-election|title=Lib Dems to pledge British return to EU in next general election |date=26 June 2016|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leader [[Tim Farron]] said that "The British people deserve the chance not to be stuck with the appalling consequences of a leave campaign that stoked that anger with the lies of Farage, Johnson and Gove."&lt;ref name="Farron"/&gt;

===More United===
In reaction to the lack of unified pro-EU voice following the referendum, members of the Liberal Democrats and others discussed the launch of a new centre-left political movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wintour|first1=Patrick|title=Liberals, celebrities and EU supporters set up progressive movement|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/19/liberals-celebrities-and-eu-supporters-set-up-progressive-movement|accessdate=24 July 2016|date=19 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was officially launched on 24 June as [[More United]], named after a line in the [[maiden speech]] of Labour MP [[Jo Cox]], who was [[Killing of Jo Cox|killed during the referendum campaign]].&lt;ref name="BusinessInsider"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shead|first1=Sam|title=Paddy Ashdown has launched a tech-driven political startup called More United that will crowdfund MPs across all parties|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/paddy-ashdown-has-launched-a-tech-driven-political-startup-called-more-united-2016-7|accessdate=24 July 2016|date=24 July 2016|newspaper=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; More United is a cross-party coalition, and will [[crowdfund]] candidates from any party who support its goals, which include [[environmentalism]], a [[market economy]] with strong [[public services]], and close co-operation with the EU.&lt;ref name="MUPrinciples"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moreunited.uk/beliefs|title=Our Principles|website=More Together|accessdate=26 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116045841/http://www.moreunited.uk/beliefs|archive-date=16 November 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UKIP===
{{further|UK Independence Party leadership election, September 2016|UK Independence Party leadership election, November 2016}}

The [[UK Independence Party]] was founded to press for British withdrawal from the EU, and following the referendum its leader [[Nigel Farage]] announced, on 4 July, that having succeeded in this goal, he would stand down as leader.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36702468|title=UKIP leader Nigel Farage stands down|publisher=BBC News|date=4 July 2016|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the resignation of the [[UK Independence Party leadership election, September 2016|elected]] leader [[Diane James]], Farage became the interim party leader on 5 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37561065|title=Nigel Farage steps back in at UKIP as Diane James quits|work=BBC news|date=5 October 2016|accessdate=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farage's successor [[Paul Nuttall]] was [[UK Independence Party leadership election, November 2016|elected]] the party leader on 28 November 2016.&lt;ref name="Fisher1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Lucy|title=Putin and Assad are on our side, claims new Ukip leader|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/farages-deputy-wins-ukip-race-and-vows-to-replace-labour-g5bw0xq38|work=The Times|subscription=yes|date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General politics==
The government and the [[Civil Service (United Kingdom)|civil service]] is heavily focused on Brexit. Former [[Head of the Home Civil Service]] [[Bob Kerslake]] has stated that there is a risk that other matters will get insufficient attention until they develop into crises.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2017/apr/09/focus-brexit-obliterates-social-policy-agenda  Crisis looms for social policy agenda as Brexit preoccupies Whitehall] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A cross party coalition of MP's has been formed to oppose hard Brexit.  This group is known as, the all-party parliamentary group on EU relations.  [[Chuka Umunna]] said that MP's should be active players rather than spectators, he said, “We will be fighting in parliament for a future relationship with the EU that protects our prosperity and rights at work, and which delivers a better and safer world.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jul/10/rebel-mps-form-cross-party-group-to-oppose-hard-brexit  Rebel MPs form cross-party group to oppose hard Brexit] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second general election===
{{further|United Kingdom general election, 2017}}
Under the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], the next general election was scheduled to be held on 7 May 2020.&lt;ref name="When"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tuft|first1=Ben|title=When will the next UK General Election be held?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/when-will-the-next-uk-general-election-be-held-10236102.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the result of the referendum, some political commentators argued that it might be necessary to hold an early general election before negotiations to leave begin.&lt;ref name=Samuel&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/the-eu-referendum-reveals-a-nation-utterly-divided--an-early-gen/ |title=The EU referendum reveals a nation utterly divided.  An early general election is the only answer |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final two candidates in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Conservative Party leadership election]] – Andrea Leadsom and Theresa May – said they would not seek an early general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/andrea-leadsom-eu-citizens-can-stay-in-uk/|title=Andrea Leadsom: EU citizens can stay in UK|author=Vince Chadwick|date=4 July 2016|accessdate=4 July 2016|website=politico.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-rules-our-early-general-election-or-second-eu-referendum-if-she-becomes-conservative-a7110656.html|title=Theresa May rules out early general election or second EU referendum if she becomes Conservative leader|author=Jon Stone|date=30 June 2016|accessdate=6 July 2016|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Leadsom's withdrawal and with May thus due to become prime minister without any broader vote, there were renewed calls for an early election from commentators&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Politics'', BBC2, 11 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and politicians. [[Tim Farron]], leader of the Liberal Democrats, called for an early election shortly after Leadsom's withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-36570120|title=David Cameron's last full day as PM and Labour leadership|date=12 July 2016|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite repeatedly previously ruling out an early General Election, May announced on 18 April 2017 her intention to call an election on 8 June 2017. This required a  two-thirds super-majority of the Commons in support of a motion for an early general election, which was agreed on 19 April.  May stated that "division in Westminster will risk ability to make a success of Brexit and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country... We need a general election and we need one now, because we have at this moment a one-off chance to get this done while the European Union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin. I have only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2017-04-18/general-election-theresa-mays-statement-in-full/|title=Theresa May's surprise General Election statement in full|last=|first=|date=18 April 2017|work=|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The snap election resulted in an unexpected [[Hung Parliament]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] losing their overall majority but remained as the largest party which has led to further political turmoil.

===Pressure groups===
{{main|Opposition to Brexit in the United Kingdom}}
Numerous pressure groups were established after the referendum to oppose Brexit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/10/brexit-resistance-getting-bigger-pro-europe-eu-referendum-organising-groups The Brexit resistance: ‘It’s getting bigger all the time’] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former prime ministers' views===
A week after the referendum, [[Gordon Brown]], a former Labour prime minister who had [[Signing of the Treaty of Lisbon#Absence of Gordon Brown|signed the Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007, warned of a danger that in the next decade the country would be refighting the referendum. He wrote that remainers were feeling they must be pessimists to prove that Brexit is unmanageable without catastrophe, while leavers optimistically claim economic risks are exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Gordon|title=The key lesson of Brexit is that globalisation must work for all of Britain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/29/key-lesson-of-brexit-globalisation-must-work-for-all-of-britain|accessdate=18 November 2016|work=The Guardian|date=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous Labour prime minister, [[Tony Blair]], in October 2016 called for a second referendum, a decision through parliament or a general election to decide finally if Britain should leave the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Joe Watts Political Editor |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-tony-blair-second-eu-referendum-vote-article-50-latest-a7384411.html |title=Brexit: Tony Blair says there must be a second vote on UK's membership of EU |work=The Independent |date=28 October 2016 |accessdate=9 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former leader of the Conservative prime minister [[John Major]] argued in November 2016 that parliament will have to ratify whatever deal is negotiated and then, depending on the deal there could be a case for a second referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-38092635|title=Tony Blair 'to help the UK's politically homeless'|date=24 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawal negotiations==
{{main|Brexit negotiations}}
In the summer of 2018, a survey by YouGov indicated that five British people think the government is handling negotiations badly for every one who approves of the government's negotiations. In another survery, voters indicated dissatisfaction not only with the UK government. The polling organisation NatCen found 57% think the EU is handling Brexit talks badly, while only 16% believe it is doing well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-45520517 What British people think about Brexit now] ''[[BBC]]'' 18 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immigration concerns===
To what extent free movement of people would or would not be retained in any post-Brexit deal with the EU has emerged as a key political issue.

In late July 2016, discussions were underway that might provide the UK with an exemption from the EU rules on refugees' freedom of movement for up to seven years.

According to CEP analysis of Labour Force Survey, immigrants in the UK are on average more educated than UK-born citizens. Citizens in the UK are concerned that immigrants are taking over their jobs since most immigrants are highly educated, however, they are actually helping the economy because they too consume goods, and produce jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Dhingra|first2=Swati|last3=Ottaviano|first3=Gianmarco|last4=John|first4=Van Reenen|title=Brexit and the Impact of Immigration on the UK|url=http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/brexit05.pdf|last1=Wadsworth|first1=Jonathan|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigrants to the UK help to mitigate the negative effects of the ageing British labour force and are believed to have an overall net positive fiscal effect. Some have argued that immigration has a dampening effect on wages due to the greater supply of labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Brexit and Immigration|journal=Economic Outlook|volume=40|issue=2|page=20|doi=10.1111/1468-0319.12215|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies suggest that immigration has only a small impact on the average wage of workers.

Annual net immigration from the EU to the UK has, thus, fallen to about 100,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Notification of intention to leave the EU (Article 50)===
{{main|United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union}}
The most likely way that exit from the EU is activated is through [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union]]. The British government chooses when to invoke, although theoretically the other members of the European Union could refuse to negotiate before invocation.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;"It is entirely up to the departing member state to trigger article 50, by issuing formal notification of intention to leave: no one, in Brussels, Berlin or Paris, can force it to. But equally, there is nothing in article 50 that obliges the EU to start talks – including the informal talks the Brexit leaders want – before formal notification has been made. 'There is no mechanism to compel a state to withdraw from the European Union,' said Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at Cambridge University.... 'The notification of article 50 is a formal act and has to be done by the British government to the European council,' an EU official told Reuters." {{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/who-will-dare-pull-trigger-article-50-eu|title=Will Article 50 ever be triggered?|author=Jon Henley|date=26 June 2016|newspaper=The Observer|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the first time that this article has been invoked.

===Informal discussions===
On 20 July 2016, following her first overseas trip as prime minister, during which she flew to Berlin for talks with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], Theresa May reaffirmed her intention not to trigger Article 50 before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a "sensible and orderly departure" from the EU. However, although Merkel said it was right for the UK to "take a moment" before beginning the process, she urged May to provide more clarity on a timetable for negotiations. Shortly before travelling to Berlin, May had also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the [[presidency of the Council of the European Union]], which passes between member states every six months on a rotation basis, and that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36841066 |title=Brexit: Theresa May says talks won't start in 2016 |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rowena |last=Mason |first2=Philip |last2=Oltermann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/20/angela-merkel-backs-theresa-mays-plan-not-to-trigger-brexit-this-year |title=Angela Merkel backs Theresa May's plan not to trigger Brexit this year |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of Remain and Leave votes varied dramatically across the country.&lt;ref name="Split"/&gt; Remain won every single Scottish district, most [[London boroughs]], Gibraltar and the predominantly Catholic parts of Northern Ireland, as well as many English and Welsh cities. Leave by contrast won almost all other English and Welsh districts and most of the predominantly [[Ulster Protestant]] districts, and won a majority in Wales as a whole as well as every [[Regions of England|English region]] outside London. These results were interpreted by many commentators as revealing a "split" or "divided" country, and exacerbated regional tensions.&lt;ref name="Split"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Divided"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/23/united-kingdom-two-nations-political-chasm-left|title=The UK is now two nations, staring across a political chasm |author=John Harris|date=23 June 2016|accessdate=8 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
Of the constituent countries in the United Kingdom, England voted most in favour of leaving the European Union with 53% of voters choosing to leave compared to 47% of voters who chose to remain. Every region apart from [[Greater London]] returned large majority votes in favour of "Leave". The largest regional vote in favour of "Leave" was recorded in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] which saw 59% of voters chose to leave the EU which was closely followed by the [[East Midlands]] which saw 58% of voters opting to leave. The East Midlands also saw the two highest local authority votes in the United Kingdom in favour of leaving the EU which was recorded in the [[Borough of Boston]] in [[Lincolnshire]] in which 75.6% of voters chose to leave which was closely followed by the neighbouring local authority [[South Holland District Council|South Holland]] which saw 73% of voters there opting to leave.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36616747|title=England's most pro and anti-EU boroughs|first1=|last1=|first2=|last=|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 July, following her first official talks with Nicola Sturgeon at [[Bute House]], Theresa May said that she was "willing to listen to options" on Scotland's future relationship with the European Union and wanted the Scottish government to be "fully involved" with discussions, but that Scotland had sent a "very clear message" on independence in 2014.

Although Wales voted to leave the European Union, [[Leanne Wood]], the leader of [[Plaid Cymru]] suggested that the result had "changed everything" and that it was time to begin a debate about independence for Wales. Sources including ''[[The Guardian]]'' have noted that opinion polls tend to put the number in favour of Wales seceding from the United Kingdom at 10%, but Wood suggested in a speech shortly after the referendum that attitudes could change following the result: "The Welsh economy and our constitution face unprecedented challenges. We must explore options that haven’t been properly debated until now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven |last=Morris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/27/its-time-to-put-welsh-independence-on-agenda-leanne-wood |title=It's time to put Welsh independence on agenda – Leanne Wood |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 June 2016 |accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 July, a YouGov opinion poll commissioned by [[ITV Wales]] indicated that 35% would vote in favour of Welsh independence in the event that it meant Wales could stay in the European Union, but Professor [[Roger Scully]], of [[Cardiff University]]'s Wales Governance Centre said the poll indicated a "clear majority" against Wales ceasing to be part of the UK: “The overall message appears to be that while Brexit might reopen the discussion on Welsh independence there is little sign that the Leave vote in the EU referendum has yet inclined growing numbers of people to vote Leave in a referendum on Welsh independence from the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shipton |first=Martin |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/third-voters-would-back-independence-11567766 |title=A third of voters would back independence for Wales – if the country could stay in the EU as the rest of the UK left |newspaper=Western Mail |date=5 July 2016 |accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greater London]] voted to remain in the EU, and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she had spoken to London Mayor [[Sadiq Khan]] about the possibility of remaining in the EU and said he shared that objective for London. A petition calling on Khan to [[London secessionism|declare London independent]] from the UK received tens of thousands of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36620401|title=Petition for London independence signed by thousands after Brexit vote|work=BBC News|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/londependence-petition-calls-for-london-to-join-the-eu-on-its-own-a7101006.html|title='Londependence' petition calls for London to join the EU on its own|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported the petition as [[tongue-in-cheek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-36620558 |title=After Brexit vote, a tongue-in-cheek call for independence for London |work=BBC |date=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of London's independence argued that London's demographic, culture and values are different from the rest of England, and that it should become a [[city state]] similar to Singapore, while remaining an EU member state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/06/24/londoners-want-their-own-independence-after-brexit-result/|title=Londoners want their own independence after Brexit result|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/06/24/70000-sign-petition-for-london-to-become-independent-and-rejoin-the-eu-5965541/|title=70,000 sign petition for London to become independent and rejoin the EU|author=Nicole Morley|work=Metro|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spencer Livermore, Baron Livermore]], said that London's independence "should be a goal," arguing that a London city-state would have twice the GDP of Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/eu-referendum-london-independence_uk_576d4c57e4b0d257114993a2|title=London Independence Goes Beyond A Twitter Joke With Politicians Seriously Discussing It|date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan said that complete independence was unrealistic, but demanded devolving more powers and autonomy for London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sadiq Khan: Now London must 'take back control', 28 June 2016|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayor-addresses-top-business-leaders|publisher=london.gov.uk|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gibraltar===

{{main|Gibraltar after Brexit}}

Spain's foreign minister [[José García-Margallo y Marfil|José Manuel García-Margallo]] said "It's a complete change of outlook that opens up new possibilities on Gibraltar not seen for a very long time. I hope the formula of co-sovereignty – to be clear, the Spanish flag on the Rock – is much closer than before."&lt;ref name="uk.reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Spain to seek co-sovereignty on Gibraltar after Brexit |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-eu-gibraltar-idUKKCN0ZA169 |agency=Reuters |date= 24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibraltar's Chief Minister [[Fabian Picardo]] however immediately dismissed García-Margallo's remarks, stating that "there will be no talks, or even talks about talks, about the sovereignty of Gibraltar", and asked Gibraltar's citizens "to ignore these noises".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gibraltar stands defiant against Spain after Brexit vote |work=[[The Local]] |url=http://www.thelocal.es/20160624/gibraltar-defiant-against-spain-after-brexit |date=24 June 2016 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is while he was in talks with Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister of Scotland, to keep Gibraltar in the EU, while remaining British too. He said that "I can imagine a situation where some parts of what is today the member state United Kingdom are stripped out and others remain."

==Republic of Ireland==
The Republic of Ireland, which shares a land border with the United Kingdom, joined the then European Communities alongside its neighbour on 1 January 1973, and as of 2016, its trade with the UK was worth £840m (€1bn) a week, while as many as 380,000 Irish citizens were employed in the UK. Britain was also a significant contributor towards the 2010 [[Economic Adjustment Programme for Ireland|bailout package]] that was put together in the wake of the [[Post-2008 Irish banking crisis|banking crisis]] of the late 2000s. Concerned by the possibility of a UK vote to leave the EU, in 2015, [[Enda Kenny]], the [[Taoiseach]] of Ireland, established an office to put together a contingency plan in the event of a Brexit vote.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Ireland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Ireland"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Shane |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36839998 |title=Brexit: Irish concerns over implications of UK vote |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 July 2016, ''[[Bloomberg News]]'' reported that the UK's vote to leave the EU was having a negative impact on the Republic of Ireland, a country with close economic and cultural ties to the UK. Share prices in Ireland fell after the result, while exporters warned that a weaker UK currency would drive down wages and economic growth in a country still recovering from the effects of the banking crisis. [[John Bruton]], who served as Taoiseach from 1994 to 1997, and later an EU ambassador to the United States, described Britain's vote to leave the European Union as "the most serious, difficult issue facing the country for 50 years".&lt;ref name="Bloomberg Ireland"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dara |last=Doyle |first2=Marc |last2=Champion |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-17/ireland-hits-brexit-alarm-in-biggest-foreign-crisis-in-50-years |title=Ireland Hits Brexit Alarm in Biggest Foreign Crisis in 50 Years |work=Bloomberg News |publisher=Bloomberg |date=18 July 2016 |accessdate=20 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Ashmore, head of the [[Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland]] argued the uncertainty caused by the result had made attracting new business lenders into Ireland more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/brexit/brexit-decision-makes-it-harder-to-attract-new-business-lenders-to-ireland-sbci-boss-34902243.html |title=Brexit decision makes it harder to attract new business lenders to Ireland – SBCI boss |newspaper=The Irish Independent |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, John McGrane, director general of the British Irish Chamber of Commerce, said the organisation had been inundated with enquiries from UK firms wishing to explore the feasibility of basing themselves in a country "with the same language and legal system and with a commitment to staying in the EU".&lt;ref name="BBC Ireland"/&gt;

On 21 July, following talks in Dublin, Kenny and French President [[Francois Hollande]] issued a joint statement saying they "looked forward to the notification as soon as possible by the new British government of the UK's intention to withdraw from the Union" because it would "permit orderly negotiations to begin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-36850619 |title=Ireland and France call for EU Brexit process to start 'as soon as possible' |publisher=BBC News  |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollande also suggested Ireland should secure a "special situation" in discussions with European leaders during the UK's European withdrawal negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Juno |last=McEnroe |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/brexit-represents-special-situation-for-ireland-says-hollande-745917.html |title=Brexit represents 'special situation for Ireland', says Hollande |newspaper=The Irish Examiner |publisher=Landmark Media Investments |date=21 July 2016 |accessdate=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2016, figures released by the [[National Police Chiefs' Council]] indicated there were 3,076 reported hate crimes and incidents across England, Wales and Northern Ireland between 16–30 June, compared to 2,161 for the same period in 2015, a 42% increase; the number of incidents peaked on 25 June, when there were 289 reported cases.

==Post-referendum campaigning==

===Petition for a new referendum===
{{see also|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016#Petition for a new referendum}}
Within hours of the result's announcement, a petition, calling for a second referendum to be held in the event that a result was secured with less than 60% of the vote and on a turnout of less than 75%, attracted tens of thousands of new signatures. The petition had been initiated by William Oliver Healey of the [[English Democrats]] on 24 May 2016, when the Remain faction had been leading in the polls, and had received 22 signatures prior to the referendum result being declared.&lt;ref name=investigation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Healey&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=York |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/william-oliver-healey-referendum-petition_uk_576f8b28e4b0232d331e1b39 |title=Second EU Referendum Petition Started By Leave Voter William Oliver Healey |work=The Huffington Post |publisher=Verizon |date=26 June 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC-Coleman/&gt; On 26 June, Healey said that the petition had actually been started to favour an exit from the EU and that he was a strong supporter of the Vote Leave and Grassroots Out campaigns.

===Backing for a new referendum===
The [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] fears that any Brexit deal the government might make could harm workers' interests and lead to workers in many industries losing their jobs.  [[Frances O'Grady]] of the TUC said that unless the government provides a deal that is good for working people, the TUC will strongly support calls for a second referendum.  O'Grady said, "I want to serve notice to the prime minister today that if we don't get the deal that working people need, then the TUC will be throwing our full weight behind a campaign for a popular vote so that people get a say on whether that deal is good enough or not,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-45464115 Brexit: TUC issues new EU referendum warning to May] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate over legitimacy of a second referendum===

The petition initiated a debate over the legitimacy of holding a second referendum. BBC political correspondent [[Iain Watson]] argued that since the petition requests a piece of retrospective legislation, it is unlikely to be enacted,&lt;ref name=investigation/&gt; while David Cameron had previously ruled out holding a second referendum, calling it "a once-in-a-lifetime event".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicholas |last=Winning |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-prime-minister-david-cameron-rules-out-another-vote-on-whether-to-leave-eu-1463492823 |title=British Prime Minister Cameron Rules Out Another Vote on Leaving EU |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Whitaker |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/david-cameron-rules-out-second-eu-referendum-1-4035895 |title=David Cameron rules out second EU referendum |newspaper=The Scotsman |publisher=Johnston Press |date=22 February 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jolyon Maugham]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], a barrister specialising in tax law, argued that a second referendum on EU membership could be triggered by one of two scenarios: following a [[snap general election]] won by one or more parties standing on a remain platform, or as a result of parliament deciding that circumstances had changed significantly enough to require a fresh mandate. Maugham cited several instances in which a country's electorate have been asked to reconsider the outcome of a referendum relating to the EU, among them the two [[Treaty of Lisbon]] referendums held in Ireland, in [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008|2008]] and [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jolyon |last=Maugham |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-petition-second-eu-referendum-how-to-get-new-vote-on-uk-membership-a7102646.html |title=How to deliver a second EU referendum |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=25 June 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Vernon Bogdanor]] said that a second referendum would be "highly unlikely", and suggested governments would be cautious about holding referendums in future,&lt;ref name="Telegraph second referendum"/&gt; but argued it could happen if the EU rethought some of its policies, such as those regarding the [[Freedom of movement for workers in the European Union|free movement of workers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Vernon |last=Bogdanor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/19/second-referendum-britain-eu-leaders-listen |title=There could still be a second referendum in Britain – if EU leaders listen |newspaper=The Guardian |date=19 July 2016 |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[John Curtice]] agreed that a change of circumstances could result in another referendum, but said the petition would have little effect.&lt;ref name="Telegraph second referendum"&gt;{{cite news|first=Camilla |last=Turner |first2=Michael |last2=Wilkinson |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/25/could-britain-actually-have-a-second-referendum-on-brexit/ |title=As three million people sign a petition for a second EU referendum we ask – could it actually happen? |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=26 June 2016 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBC legal correspondent [[Clive Coleman]] argued that a second referendum was "constitutionally possible [but] politically unthinkable.

On 26 June, former prime minister [[Tony Blair]] said the option of holding a second referendum should not be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/update/2016-06-26/tony-blair-dont-rule-out-a-second-eu-referendum/|title=Tony Blair: 'Don't rule out a second EU referendum'|work=ITV News |publisher=ITV |date=26 June 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later he suggested the will of the people could change, and that Parliament should reflect that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ashley |last=Cowburn |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-tony-blair-second-eu-referendum-chilcot-report-latest-news-a7116776.html |title=Tony Blair says the UK 'should keep its options open' over Brexit |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=3 July 2016 |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alastair Campbell]], the [[Downing Street Director of Communications]] under Blair called for a second referendum setting out "the terms on which we leave.

Following the first post-referendum meeting of the Cabinet on 27 June, a spokesman for the Prime Minister said that the possibility of a second referendum was "not remotely on the cards. There was a decisive result [in the EU referendum]. The focus of the Cabinet discussion was how we get on and deliver that."&lt;ref name="Cooper"/&gt; Theresa May also ruled out the possibility at the launch of her campaign to succeed Cameron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jon |last=Stone |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-rules-our-early-general-election-or-second-eu-referendum-if-she-becomes-conservative-a7110656.html |title=Theresa May rules out early general election or second EU referendum if she becomes Conservative leader |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 June, Health Secretary [[Jeremy Hunt (politician)|Jeremy Hunt]] raised the possibility of a second referendum, but said that it would be about the terms of the UK's exit from the European Union rather than on the issue of EU membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lizzie |last=Dearden |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-running-conservative-party-leader-second-eu-referendum-brexit-vote-a7106836.html |title=Jeremy Hunt raises prospect of second EU vote while announcing he may run as Conservative Party leader |newspaper=The Independent |publisher=Independent Print Limited |date=28 June 2016 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labour MP [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]] also suggested that a second referendum would focus on the terms of an exit plan, with a default of remaining in the EU if it were rejected. Citing a poll published in the week after the referendum that indicated as many as 1.1&amp;nbsp;million people who voted to leave the EU regretted their decision, he tabled an [[early day motion]] calling for an exit package referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Geraint |last=Davies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/30/second-eu-referendum-pull-us-out-of-fire-make-happen |title=A second EU referendum could pull us out of the fire.

On 26 June it was reported that Conservative grandee [[Michael Heseltine]] was suggesting that a second referendum should take place after Brexit negotiations, pointing to the overwhelming majority in the House of Commons against leaving the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anushka Asthana |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/26/fightback-against-brexit-on-cards-remain-eu-referendum-heseltine |title=Parliamentary fightback against Brexit on cards |work=The Guardian |accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 July, Labour leadership candidate [[Owen Smith (politician)|Owen Smith]] said that he would offer a second referendum on the terms of EU withdrawal if elected to lead the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anushka |last=Asthana |first2=Heather |last2=Stewart |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/13/owen-smith-to-offer-referendum-on-brexit-deal-if-elected-labour-leader |title=Owen Smith to offer referendum on Brexit deal if elected Labour leader |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 July 2016 |accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official investigations into campaigns==

On 9 May 2016, Leave.EU was fined £50,000 by the UK [[Information Commissioner's Office]] 'for failing to follow the rules about sending marketing messages': they sent people text messages without having first gained their permission to do so.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/1624135/mpn-better-for-the-country-20160509.pdf DATA PROTECTION ACT 1998 SUPERVISORY POWERS OF THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER MONETARY PENALTY NOTICE] (9 May 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2016/05/eu-campaign-firm-fined-for-sending-spam-texts/ EU campaign firm fined for sending spam texts]' (11 May 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2017, the Information Commissioner's Office also reported that it was 'conducting a wide assessment of the data-protection risks arising from the use of data analytics, including for political purposes' in relation to the Brexit campaign. It was specified that among the organisations to be investigated was [[Cambridge Analytica]] and its relationship with the Leave.EU campaign. The findings are expected to be published sometime in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Doward, Carole Cadwalladr and Alice Gibbs, '[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/mar/04/cambridge-analytics-data-brexit-trump Watchdog to launch inquiry into misuse of data in politics]', ''The Observer'' (4 March 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;Carole Cadwalladr, '[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked]', ''The Observer'' (Sunday 7 May 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 April 2017, the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] announced that it was investigating 'whether one or more donations – including of services – accepted by Leave.EU was impermissible; and whether Leave.EU’s spending return was complete', because 'there were reasonable grounds to suspect that potential offences under the law may have occurred'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/journalist/electoral-commission-media-centre/news-releases-referendums/electoral-commission-statement-on-investigation-into-leave.eu Electoral Commission statement on investigation into Leave.EU] (21 April 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

=== Accusations of foreign interference===
In the run up to the Brexit referendum, Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] suggested that Russia "might be happy" with a positive Brexit vote, while the Remain campaign accused the [[Kremlin]] of secretly backing a positive Brexit vote.&lt;ref&gt;S Rosenberg, ‘EU referendum: What does Russia gain from Brexit?’ (26 June 2016) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36629146 BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, [[Ben Bradshaw MP]] claimed in Parliament that it was "highly probable" that Russia had interfered in the Brexit referendum campaign.&lt;ref&gt;''Highly probable' that Russia interfered in Brexit referendum, Labour MP says' (13 December 2016) [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/russian-interference-brexit-highly-probable-referendum-hacking-putin-a7472706.html Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, Bradshaw called on the British intelligence service, [[Government Communications Headquarters]], currently under [[Boris Johnson]] as Foreign Secretary, to reveal the information it had on Russian interference.&lt;ref&gt;J Kanter and A Bienkov, 'Labour MPs think the government is hiding info about Russia interfering with Brexit' (23 February 2016) [http://uk.businessinsider.com/labour-mp-ben-bradshaw-suspicious-russian-interference-brexit-2017-2?op=1 Business Insider]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the [[House of Commons]] Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee issued a report stating that Russian and foreign interference in the referendum was probable, including the shut down of the government voter registration website immediately before the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rajeev Syal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/apr/12/foreign-states-may-have-interfered-in-brexit-vote-report-says |title=Brexit: foreign states may have interfered in vote, report says |work=The Guardian |date=12 April 2017 |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, it was reported by the ''[[Irish Times]]'' that £425,622 had potentially been donated by sources in [[Saudi Arabia]] to the "vote leave" supporting [[Democratic Unionist Party]] for spending during the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;F O’Toole, ‘What connects Brexit, the DUP, dark money and a Saudi prince?’ (16 May 2017) ''Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albion Parris Howe''' (March 13, 1818 – January 25, 1897) was a [[Union Army]] general in the [[American Civil War]].  Howe's contentious relationships with superior officers in the [[Army of the Potomac]] eventually led to his being deprived of [[Division (military)|division]] command.

==Early life==
Howe was born in [[Standish, Maine]]. He graduated from the [[United States Military Academy]] in 1841. After serving in the [[4th Air Defense Artillery Regiment|4th U.S. Artillery]] for two years, he taught mathematics at the U.S. Military Academy for three years. 

Howe served in the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] and was awarded a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion in 1847 to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] for gallantry during [[Winfield Scott]]'s advance upon [[Mexico City]], especially for his actions at the [[Battle of Contreras]] and the [[Battle of Churubusco]]. He was promoted to the rank of captain on March 2, 1855. Howe served under [[Robert E. Lee]] during the suppression of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] at [[Harpers Ferry]].

==Civil War==
At the beginning of the Civil War, Howe served under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George B. McClellan]] in [[West Virginia in the American Civil War|western Virginia]]. He took command of [[John J. Peck|John J. Peck's]] 3rd Brigade, ([[Gardes Lafayette|55th New York]], [[Anderson Zouaves|62nd New York]], and the 93rd, 98th, and 102nd Pennsylvania regiments) [[Darius N. Couch|Couch's]] 1st Division, [[Erasmus D. Keyes|Keyes's]] [[IV Corps (Union Army)|IV Corps]] during the [[Seven Days Battles]], after Peck was promoted to command of [[Silas Casey|Silas Casey's]] Division of the same corps. Howe received the brevet rank of [[Major (United States)|major]] in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]] for his role at the [[Battle of Malvern Hill]]. He was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the volunteer service on June 11, 1862.

In the subsequent campaigns of the [[Army of the Potomac]], Howe fought in the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and was present at the [[Battle of Antietam]]. He was promoted to command 2nd Division, [[VI Corps (Union Army)|VI Corps]], leading it at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]. His division was heavily engaged at [[Battle of Fredericksburg II|Fredericksburg]] and [[Battle of Salem Church|Salem Church]] during the [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville Campaign]]. Howe's division led a reconnaissance in the vicinity of Fredericksburg on June 3, 1863, as the Union high command tried to determine whether the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] was moving out of its positions to undertake an offensive. It was only minimally engaged in the [[Gettysburg Campaign|campaign]] culminating in the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. His division was the last to reach the battlefield and his two brigades were assigned to opposite ends of the Union line, leaving him effectively without a command.&lt;ref&gt;Tagg, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; During the pursuit of Lee's retreating army, the [[1st Vermont Brigade]] of Howe's division fought the Confederate rear guard near [[Funkstown, Maryland]], on July 10, 1863. Howe continued in division command during the [[Bristoe Campaign]] and the [[Mine Run Campaign]]. 

Howe was removed from command by Maj. Gen. [[George G. Meade]] shortly thereafter. Howe's bad relationship with his corps commander, Maj. Gen. [[John Sedgwick]], including support of Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] in the controversies that were spawned by the Union defeat at Chancellorsville, probably contributed to this removal. Meade, if he did not initiate Howe's removal, at least did not oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, p. 80,&lt;/ref&gt;  Howe testified against Meade and Sedgwick before the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], claiming Sedgwick spoke to him about retreating to [[Westminster, Maryland]].  Sedgwick's testimony before the committee contradicted Howe's without naming him.  The committee did not pursue this contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; What is clear is that Sedgwick sought the services of Brig. Gen. [[George W. Getty]] to replace Howe in command of the 2nd Division.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, pp. 141, 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Army of the Potomac, Howe commanded the artillery depot in [[Washington, D.C.]] He was in the field briefly at Harpers Ferry, opposing the raid on Washington by Confederate [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Lieutenant general|Lieutenant General]] [[Jubal Early]].

==Postbellum service==
[[File:Mrs Elizabeth M Howe, by Cecilia Beaux.jpg|thumb|Mrs. Elizabeth M. Howe ([[Cecilia Beaux]], 1903)]]
At the close of the war, Howe served in the honor guard that stood watch over the corpse of [[Abraham Lincoln]], and soon afterward was appointed as a member of the [[military justice|military commission]] that tried the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln conspirators]]. Howe did not make any public comments on the conviction or hanging of [[Mary E. Surratt]], but was not among the five officers who petitioned President [[Andrew Johnson]] to commute her sentence to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, n. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; Both assignments may indicate that the [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican]] faction in the Congress found him useful and sympathetic.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served in the [[Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands|Freedmen's Bureau]] in 1865. Howe was mustered out of the volunteer service on July 15, 1866.

Howe retired from the Army on June 30, 1882, at the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. He was a veteran companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].  He died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and is buried there in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Eicher, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

Howe was married to Elizabeth, daughter of Andrew Mahaffey, a superintendent of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and Elizabeth McPherson. They had six children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5768513 Lot notes of the painting of Elizabeth Howe by Cecilia Beaux] Christie's, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Annecy International Animation Film Festival''' (French: '''''Festival International du Film d'Animation d'Annecy''''', abbreviated as '''AIAFF''') was created in 1960 and takes place at the beginning of June in the town of [[Annecy]], [[France]]. Initially occurring every two years, the festival became an annual event in 1998. It is one of the four international animated film festivals sponsored by the ''Association Internationale du Film d'Animation'' (or ASIFA, the [[International Animated Film Association]]).

The festival is a competition between [[cartoon]] films of various techniques ([[animated cartoon|animated drawings]], [[Cutout animation|cut-out papers]], [[modelling clay]], etc.) classified in various categories:
* [[Feature films]]
* [[Short films]]
* Films produced for television and advertising
* Student films
* Films made for the internet (since 2002)

Throughout the festival, in addition to the competing films projected in various cinemas of the city, an open-air night projection is organized on Pâquier, in the centre of town, amongst the lake and with the mountains. According to the topic of the festival, classic or recent films are projected upon the giant screen. On Saturday evening, all the award winners are presented.

The '''Ati-Atihan Festival''' is a feast held annually in January in honor of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]] (Infant Jesus), concluding on the third Sunday, in the town of [[Kalibo, Aklan]] in the island of [[Panay]], [[Philippines]]. The name ''Ati-Atihan'' means "to be like Atis" or "to make believe Atis", the local name for the [[Aeta]] aborigines who first settled in Panay Island and other parts of the archipelago.

The festival consists of tribal dance, music, accompanied by indigenous costumes and weapons, and parade along the street. Christians and non-Christians observe this day with religious processions. It has inspired many other Philippine Festivals including the [[Sinulog Festival]] of [[Cebu]] and [[Dinagyang]] of [[Iloilo City]], both adaptations of the Kalibo's Ati-Atihan Festival, and legally holds the title "The Mother of All Philippine Festivals" in spite of the other two festivals' claims of the same title.

==History==
A 1200 A.D. event explains the origins of the festival. A group of 10 [[Malay race|Malay]] chieftains called ''[[Datu]]s'', fleeing from the island of [[Borneo]] settled in the Philippines, and were granted settlement by the [[Ati (tribe)|Ati]] people, the tribes of [[Panay Island]]. Datu Puti, minister made a trade with the natives and bought the plains for a golden salakot, brass basins and bales of cloth. They gave a very long necklace to the wife of the Ati chieftain. Feasting and festivities followed soon after. 
[[File:Ati-Atihan 2007.jpg|thumb|right|160px]]
Some time later, the Ati people were struggling with famine as the result of a bad harvest. They were forced to descend from their mountain village into the settlement below, to seek the generosity of the people who now lived there. The ''Datus'' obliged and gave them food. In return, the Ati danced and sang for them, grateful for the gifts they had been given.

The misoln was originally a pagan festival from this tribe practicing Animism, and their worshiping their [[anito]] god. [[Spain|Spanish]] missionaries gradually added a Christian meaning. Today, the Ati-Atihan is celebrated as a religious festival.

In 2012, the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts]] (NCCA) and the ICHCAP of [[UNESCO]] published ''Pinagmulan: Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage''. The first edition of the [[UNESCO]]-backed book included the ''Ati-atihan Festival'', signifying its great importance to Philippine intangible cultural heritage. The local government of Aklan, in coopration with the NCCA, is given the right to nominate the Ati-atihan Festival in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ichcap.org/eng/ek/sub3/sub2.php|title=Pinagmulan: Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage|website=www.ichcap.org|accessdate=21 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
[[File:The Mobonians2007a.jpg|thumb|right|200px]] The people attend masses for the ''Santo Niño'', and benefit dances sponsored by government organizations. The formal opening mass emphasizes the festival’s religious event. The procession begins with a rhythmic drumbeats, and dances parading along the street. The second day begins at dawn with a rosary procession, which ends with a community mass, and procession. The phrase "Hala Bira! Pwera Pasma!" is originally associated with the Sto. Nino Ati-Atihan Festival as the revelers and devotees keep on going with the festivities all over the town from morning to the wee hours of the next morning, rain or shine, for one week or even more. They believe that the miraculous Child Jesus will protect them from harm and illness.  The highlight of the festival occurs on the last day, the third Sunday of January, when groups representing different tribes compete for tourists' attention and prizes. The festival ends with a procession of thousands of people carrying torches and different kinds of images of the Santo Niño. The contest winners are announced at a masquerade ball which officially ends the festival.

Founded on October 5, 1947, '''Cominform''' (from '''Communist Information Bureau''') is the common name for what was officially referred to as the '''Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Healey|first=Denis|date=|title=The Cominform and World Communism|url=|journal=International Affairs|volume=24, 3|pages=339-349}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first official forum of the [[International Communist Movement]] since the dissolution of the [[Comintern]] and confirmed the new realities after [[World War II]], including the creation of an [[Eastern Bloc]].  

==Overview==
The intended purpose of Cominform was to coordinate actions between Communist parties under Soviet direction. It was not intended to be a replacement or successor to the [[Communist International|Comintern]]. The Cominform was not a world Communist party, it did not have subordinates or power, other than its publication. It had its own newspaper, ''For Lasting Peace, for People's Democracy!'' It limited itself to one goal: "to organize an exchange of experience, and where necessary to coordinate the activity of the Communist parties, on the basis of mutual agreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmerman|first=Heinz|date=Spring 1985|title=The cominform effects on Soviet foreign policy|url=|journal=Studies in Comparative Communism|volume=18, 1|pages=3-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other aspects, Cominform was also used to repel anti-communist expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed: 1945 to the Present|last=Hunt|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=38|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French and Italian parties were tasked specifically with the obstruction of the implementation of the [[Marshall Plan]] and the [[Truman Doctrine]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 February 2017|title=Cominform|url=|journal=Britannica Academic|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cominform divided the world into imperialist and anti-imperialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deery and Redfern|first=|date=May 2005|title=No Lasting Peace? Labor, Communism and the Cominform: Australia and Great Britain, 1945-50|url=|journal=Labour History|volume=88|pages=63-86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cominform was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-dominated organization of Communist parties founded in September 1947 at a conference of [[Communist party]] leaders in [[Szklarska Poręba]], [[Poland]]. It was founded with nine members, the Communist parties of the U.S.S.R., Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, France, and Italy. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] called the conference in response to divergences among communist governments on whether or not to attend the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris Conference]] on the [[Marshall Plan]] in July 1947. 

Cominform was initially located in [[Belgrade]] (then the capital of the [[Federative People's Republic of Yugoslavia]]). After the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the group in June 1948, the seat was moved to [[Bucharest]], [[Romanian People's Republic|Romania]]. The expulsion of the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] from Cominform for ''[[Titoism]]'' initiated the ''[[Informbiro period]]'' in that country's history. One of the most decisive factors that led to the expulsion of Yugoslavia was their commitment to the insurgency in Greece, and their decision to station troops in Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swain|first=Geoffrey|date=1 March 2010|title=The Cominform: Tito's International?|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=35, Issue 3|pages=641-663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper was published in several languages. It was originally printed in Belgrade; it was moved to Bucharest after the expulsion of the Yugoslavian party.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Bernard S.|date=April 1953|title=The Cominfom: A Five-Year Perspective|url=|journal=World Politics|volume=5, 3|pages=368-376}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast array of articles was published, including some from the Canadian Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Black|first=J. L.|date=Spring 1988|title=The Stalinist Image of Canada The Cominform and Soviet Press, 1947-1955|url=|journal=Labour / Le Travail|volume=21|pages=153-171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cominform was dissolved on April 17, 1956, after the Soviet [[rapprochement]] with Yugoslavia and the process of [[History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985)|De-Stalinization]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Meetings ==

There are four recorded meetings of the Cominform, before 1956. The first was the founding meeting. This occurred in Poland, 1947. Members present at the first meeting were [[Kardelj]] and [[Milovan Djilas|Djilas]] for Yugoslavia, [[Valko Chervenkov|Chervenkov]] and [[Poptomov]] for Bulgaria, [[Gheorghiu-Dej]] and [[Anna Pauker]] for Romania, [[Mihály Farkas|Farkas]] and [[József Révai|Revai]] for Hungary, [[Władysław Gomułka|Gomulka]] and [[Hilary Minc|Minc]] for Poland, [[Andrei Zhdanov|Zhdanov]] and [[Malenkov]] for the U.S.S.R., [[Jacques Duclos|Duclos]] and [[Frajon]] for France, [[Rudolf Slánský|Slánský]] and [[Bastovanski]] for Czechoslovakia, and [[Luigi Longo|Longo]] and [[Reala]]{{dn|date=November 2017}} for Italy. Zhdanov was chairman, Gomulka was appointed vice-chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G.I.|first=|date=May 1950|title=The Evolution of the Cominform 1947-1950|url=|journal=The World Today|volume=6, 5|pages=213-228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The second meeting occurred in Yugoslavia in January 1948. During this meeting, a permanent editorial board was chosen for the newspaper. This editorial board was under the leadership of Yugoslav national, [[Pavel Yudin|P. Yudin]]. He was succeeded by U.S.S.R. national, [[Mark Borisovich Mitin|M. Mitin]], after the Yugoslavian expulsion. A third meeting occurred in Romania in June 1948. This resulted in the expulsion of the Yugoslav Communist party. Lastly, the fourth meeting was held in Hungary in November 1949.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9698">'''Dalles des Morts''', also known as '''Death Rapids''' in English, was a famously violent stretch of the [[Columbia River]] upstream from [[Revelstoke, British Columbia]], Canada, now submerged beneath the waters of the [[Lake Revelstoke Reservoir]].

==History==

===1817===
The rapids acquired their name after a dark series of events in 1817, when a crew of [[North West Company]] [[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageur]]s lost their canoes and food during a traverse of the rapids and were forced to attempt the overland journey to [[Spokane House]], with only one survivor being rescued by local native people after a harrowing survival ordeal, and a confession of cannibalistic survival:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Dalles des Morts [mis-spelled "Dalle de Mort" on Trutch's 1871 map of British Columbia.] The French form originated with NWC voyageurs in 1817, when seven men were wrecked here and all their food was lost. They began walking along the river hoping to reach Spokane House, the nearest establishment, over {{convert|300|mi|km}} away. High water forced them up into the almost impenetrable forest. One by one they died, the survivors resorting to cannibalism. The last one was found by Indians on the shore of Upper Arrow lake and was taken to Kettle Falls, whence he was conducted to Spokane House. His story that he had killed his last companion in self defence was not believed, and he was dismissed from the NWC service, escaping more serious punishment owing to lack of evidence against him.

(from Douglas of the Fir: A Biography of David Douglas, Botanist, by A.G. Harvey; Harvard University Press, 1947, p.110)
Source: Provincial Archives of BC "Place Names File" compiled 1945-1950 by A.G. Harvey from various sources, with subsequent additions &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://ilmbwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=50400 "Death Rapids: Origin notes and history", BC Geographical Name Information Service]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"In 1817 a party of seven Nor'westers was sent back to Spokane House [from [[Boat Encampment]]] because they were too ill to traverse the Rocky Mountains with the rest of the party. Their canoes and provisions were lost at the rapids here. Without supplies, they proceeded on foot very slowly, as they were weak and had only water for sustenance (there being no berries at this time of year). On the third day, the first man died and his remains were eventually eaten by the survivors. This continued until only two men were left, La Pierre and Dubois. Only La Pierre was found alive and he maintained that Dubois had attempted to kill him, but he had succeeded in overpowering and killing him in self defence. La Pierre's story was doubted, but he couldn't be convicted on the evidence." (from Adventures on the Columbia River by Ross Cox; London, 1831; vol 2, p.184-84) See also The Kootenays in Retrospect, vol 1: Columbia River Chronicles, Edward Affleck, editor, 1976.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1838===
In 1838, another even greater tragedy befell the annual [[York Factory Express]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], an annual shipment of goods, books, personnel and mail between York Factory and Fort Vancouver, a tradition that had continued an earlier annual journey by [[North West Company]] staff from [[Fort Astoria|Fort George]] to [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] on Lake Superior.  The westbound journey was known as the Autumn Express because of the time of year of its schedule, and also as the Columbia Express due to its destination (referring as much to the [[Columbia Department]] as to the [[Columbia River]])&lt;!--that's long, but please add Mackie cite or the other guy that info's in and delete whatever to style/not-overdone content--&gt;.  The 1838 Express had had a difficult journey from [[Fort Edmonton]], and the party contained an unruly upper-crust greenhorn who had eloped with one of the daughters of HBC Governor Simpson, who during an ill-advised transit of the rapids panicked and jumped from the canoe with his wife in his arms, upsetting the canoe in the process and resulting in the death of all but one who had been aboard, including himself and his wife but sparing [[Matooskie]], a native woman in the party who had lost her child in the journey via [[Athabasca Pass]].&lt;!--think it was her, longer story after I re-read the source site again--&gt;  She made her way to [[Fort of the Lakes]], at the head of Upper Arrow, and was taken to [[Fort Colville]]&lt;!--Spokane House?--&gt; with her story.&lt;!--there was an inquest as with 1817, I know, but I don't have a cite just yet--&gt;

===1860s===
During the [[Big Bend Gold Rush]] from 1865 on, the Dalles des Morts marked the head of steamboat navigation on a route that stretched from [[Marcus, Washington|Marcus, Washington Terr.]] via the Arrow Lakes and their [[Narrows (Arrow Lakes)|Narrows]] to the port-boomtown of [[La Porte, British Columbia|La Porte]], which lay at the foot of the rapids, and also at the foot of the portage to the goldfields on the creeks flanking the [[Goldstream River]], which joined the Columbia only a few miles above the rapids, around which a portage from La Porte became necessary.  (the other main goldfields of the rush were along [[Downie Creek]], which joined the Columbia just below La Porte, where another town, [[Downie Creek, British Columbia|Downie Creek]] survived as a settled locality until the inundation; La Porte did not)  The first run by the steamer [[Forty-Nine (steamboat)|Forty-Nine]] was in 1865 but made it only as far as the Narrows due to heavy ice, but the next year the steamer braved the rapids of the Narrows and in 1866 began regular service from Marcus to La Porte for the duration of the [[gold rush]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trailsintime.org/?request=ships ''"Steamboats of the Columbia"'' article in ''Trails In Time'' website by Walter Volovsek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bancroft |first= Hubert Howe |author2=William Nemos |author3=Alfred Bates  |title= History of British Columbia, 1792-1887 |year= 1887 |page= 533}} online at [https://books.google.com/books?id=zjEPAAAAYAAJ Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The other main route to the rush was via [[Pettipiece Pass]] &lt;!--and another pass, maybe--&gt; from [[Seymour Arm, British Columbia|Seymour Arm]] on [[Shuswap Lake]], another port town which sprang up at the end of the steamboat route from [[Savona, British Columbia|Savona's Ferry]] at the farther end of [[Kamloops Lake]] and accessed by a newly built but easy road from [[Cache Creek, British Columbia|Cache Creek]] via the [[Semlin Valley]] to Savona's Ferry, today's town of Savona.  From Kamloops Lake the route ran via the [[South Thompson River]], [[Little Shuswap Lake]], and the [[Little River (Little Shuswap Lake)|Little River]].&lt;!--ref is Akriggs and others, I'll be back later with cites; I think there were more steamboats above the Dalles des Morts, though...--&gt;  Still others came to the goldfields on the longer route around the Big Bend from the [[East Kootenay]] and the [[Wild Horse Creek Gold Rush]] and [[Montana]]&lt;!--whatever territory that was then - Nebraska?  Missouri?--&gt;.

==Name==
The name was formally registered in English as Death Rapids on December 12, 1939, but rescinded on April 3, 1986, upon the inundation of the site by the reservoir.  Joseph Trutch's 1870s map uses the mistaken "Dalle des Morts".  A ''dalles'' is a term from [[French language|French]] as used by the ''[[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageurs]]'' in the [[Pacific Northwest]], adapted from the usual meaning of ''dalle'' as a flagstone, or in other contexts as a gutter on a ship's deck or bridge for the purpose of draining excess water. The context of "river rapids" does not turn up in French dictionaries, but appears to be a local variation on the usual meanings, a pun on the staircase-like stones underneath some rapids and also on the rapidly draining narrow chutes that typify a "Dalles".  In the case of Dalles des Morts, the pun carries the extra weight of "gravestone", as that is the usual meaning of the phrase in French.

The more famous "Dalles" in the Pacific Northwest is the namesake of [[The Dalles, Oregon]], which was the site of the Grand Dalles de la Columbia and also the Petites Dalles or Little Dalles before the inundation of that portion of the Columbia.&lt;!--I've seen "Dalles" used on other rivers, including the Fraser or Lillooet I think; maybe it was the Okanagan, I'll try to find it again, it was a 19th C mention only--&gt;&lt;!--Old maps made by Archibald McDonald label rapids with the word "Dalls" whenever they occur, including the Fraser. He also labels "Falls" and "Cascades", implying a difference in meaning.(Pfly)--&gt;

'''''Dark Shadows''''' is a 2012 American [[horror comedy|horror comedy film]] based on the [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] television soap opera [[Dark Shadows|of the same name]]. It was directed by [[Tim Burton]] and stars [[Johnny Depp]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], [[Eva Green]], [[Jackie Earle Haley]], [[Jonny Lee Miller]], [[Chloë Grace Moretz]], and [[Bella Heathcote]] in a dual role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Review: 'Dark Shadows' is a lesson in Tim Burton's quirks|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/may/11/entertainment/la-et-dark-shadows-20120511|accessdate=September 4, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 11, 2012|author=Kenneth Turan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It’s Dragula Alex Zane reviews Dark Shadows|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/sftw/4309615/Its-Dragula.html|accessdate=September 4, 2012|newspaper=The Sun|date=May 11, 2012|author=Alex Zane|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a limited release on May 10, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=77504 | title=Dates Set for ''Dark Shadows'', ''Journey 2'' and ''Rivals'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=May 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was officially released the following day in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://collider.com/news-on-batman-3-superman-dark-shadows-and-the-hobbit-december-2013-imax-and-warner-bros-sign-up-to-20-picture-deal/23355/ | title= News on ''Batman 3'', ''Superman'', ''Dark Shadows'', and ''The Hobbit'' (December 2012!) – IMAX and Warner Bros.

The film performed disappointingly at the United States box office, but did well in foreign markets. The film received mixed reviews; critics praised its visual style and consistent humor but felt it lacked a focused or substantial plot and developed characters.&lt;ref name="rotten tomatoes" /&gt; The film was produced by [[Richard D. Zanuck]], who died two months after its release. It featured the final appearance of original series actor [[Jonathan Frid]], who died shortly before its release. It was the 200th film appearance of actor [[Christopher Lee]], and his fifth appearance in a Burton film.

==Plot==
In 1760, the Collins family moves from [[Liverpool, England]] to [[Maine]] and establishes the fishing town [[Collinsport]], where they build their estate, [[Collinwood Mansion|Collinwood]].

When he first arrives, the young son [[Barnabas Collins|Barnabas]] meets the young Angelique Bouchard, who instantly becomes besotted with him. Angelique's mother, a [[witch]], warns her against socialising with people of noble birth; however, this does not stop Angelique from following the family for many years, hoping to be loved by Barnabas, but to no avail.

By 1776, Barnabas ([[Johnny Depp]]), now a grown man, falls in love with a young woman named [[Josette du Pres]] ([[Bella Heathcote]]), scorning Angelique ([[Eva Green]]), who works as a maid in his household. Turning to [[black magic]], Angelique curses the Collins family, first by killing Barnabas's parents ([[Ivan Kaye]] and [[Susanna Cappellaro]]) in an assumed accident, then by enchanting Josette to leap to her death from a seaside cliff called Widow's Hill. In a fit of grief, Barnabas attempts to leap to his own death but fails, as Angelique curses him to the [[Immortality|immortal]] life of a [[vampire]]. When he still rejects her advances, she turns the town against him, and he is buried alive in a coffin.

196 years later, in 1972, a young Maggie Evans (also Bella Heathcote), under the assumed identity of "[[Victoria Winters]]", applies for a job as a [[governess]] at Collinwood and meets with the current reclusive [[matriarch]], [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]). Her nephew David ([[Gulliver McGrath|Gully McGrath]]), for whom Victoria will be caring, believes his mother, who drowned in a boating accident, still visits him. Victoria does not divulge that since her young age she, too, can see [[ghost]]s.

After meeting with David, his live-in [[psychiatrist]] [[Julia Hoffman]] ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]), his father Roger ([[Jonny Lee Miller]]), and Elizabeth's rebellious daughter Carolyn ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), Victoria is hired by Elizabeth. That night, Victoria sees the ghost of Josette, who warns that "he's coming" before disappearing after falling from a [[chandelier]].

Elsewhere, a group of construction workers dig up Barnabas's coffin and inadvertently free him. After satiating his bloodthirst of 196 years and shocked by the modern times he finds himself in, Barnabas returns to Collinwood, and [[Hypnosis|hypnotizes]] the [[groundskeeper]], Willie Loomis ([[Jackie Earle Haley]]), as his personal [[Renfield]], and introduces himself to the family as a "distant relative". Elizabeth believes him to be a con-man until he reveals hidden riches buried in a secret passage within the house, whereas Elizabeth thought the family to be destitute. After realising who and what Barnabas is, she asks him to keep it a secret to protect the children of his true nature, passing him off as his own descendant, "Barnabas Collins III".

During his breakfast with his newfound family, Barnabas is instantly smitten with Victoria when he meets her as she resembles Josette. Resolved to honorably win her heart, he seeks out Carolyn's advice on courting her. Angelique, now an immortal witch herself and Elizabeth's rival, learns of Barnabas' resurgence and visits him, informing him that she now has taken over Collinsport as a member of the upstanding community. In retaliation, Barnabas reopens the Collins [[Canning|Cannery]] family business and uses hypnosis to steal several of the fisherman crews who work for Angelique. As a result, she tries to buy him off. However, even after an episode of supernatural lust between the two, he rejects her offer. Meanwhile, Julia later discovers his identity by hypnotizing him and offers to cure his vampiric condition via blood transfusions.

After successfully restoring the family fortune and business, Barnabas decides to hold a ball to reintroduce the family to the townsfolk with Carolyn suggesting that they make it a happening with musician [[Alice Cooper]] as the headliner. During the ball, Barnabas catches Roger stealing from guest's coats and later finds Victoria gazing out from a balcony. Feeling comfortable around him, Victoria confides to Barnabas that she's actually an escapee from the mental asylum where her parents had her confined since she was a child due to her powers. Meanwhile, Angelique makes a grand appearance in order to see Barnabas. When she catches him and Victoria kissing, she becomes even more embittered.

Motivated after Victoria reciprocated his feelings, Barnabas seeks out Julia (wishing even more desperately to be mortal again), only to find out that the latter has been using his blood to make herself immortal. Feeling betrayed, he drains her and dumps her seemingly dead body into the town bay with Willie's help. After catching Roger trying to break into the secret passage, Barnabas gives him a choice: to stay and be an exemplary father to David or to leave with enough money to live his thieving life elsewhere. Roger chooses the latter, anguishing David. Barnabas's true identity is finally revealed to the rest of the family and Victoria when he saves David from a falling [[disco ball]]. Victoria is scared by the revelation and runs away.

Upset, Barnabas barges into Angelique's office to demand her to release him from his curse, and while she offers him blood due to her knowing that Julia is no longer around to provide him blood transfusions, she also threatens to send Victoria off Widow's Hill, the same way she did to Josette, and offers him an ultimatum: Either become partners and lovers with her or be locked in a coffin again. With Barnabas rejecting the former, she proceeds to do the latter, this time placing him in the Collins Family [[Mausoleum]]. Shortly after, he is found and freed by David, alerted by his mother's ghost, and they return towards the mansion. Meanwhile, Angelique destroys the Collins Cannery and implicates Barnabas in the murders of Julia and all the people he had to feed on, turning the townsfolk against the family.

At the mansion, Barnabas and Elizabeth see the police, Angelique, and the angry mob approaching as Carolyn withdraws into the mansion. Willing to turn himself in as long as she goes along with him, Barnabas reveals his and Angelique's true natures in front of an angry mob and a fight ensues, pitting Barnabas and Elizabeth against Angelique. During the fight (following the mob's departure upon these revelations), Carolyn reveals to her family that she is a [[werewolf]] and joins her family in their battle against Angelique, but a fire later breaks out in the house. Ultimately, the ghost of David's mother (Josephine Butler) manages to hurl Angelique against the chandelier, which then falls to the ground, mortally wounding her as she starts to shatter. She reaches into her chest and literally offers her heart to Barnabas this time as it shatters as well, resulting in her death. Concerned for Victoria's well-being, Barnabas storms off to look for her as David informs him through his mother that she's headed towards Widow's Hill. As David asks Elizabeth what they will do now, Elizabeth says that they will do what they've always done as the Collins family: "Endure."

After catching up to Victoria at Widow's Hill, Barnabas stops her from leaping and refuses to turn her into a vampire to save her from eternal suffering as an immortal, despite her request. Touched, Victoria throws herself from its cliffs anyway, resulting in Barnabas leaping after her and biting her, so that she can survive the fall as a vampire. She awakens, asking him to call her Josette, and the two kiss passionately on the rocky shore.

The closing scene is at the bottom of the bay as Julia opens her eyes to her new immortal life.

==Cast==
* [[Johnny Depp]] as [[Barnabas Collins]], an 18th-century [[vampire]] who awakens to the 20th century.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; While an [[Empathy|empathetic]] character aware of his sinister nature, Barnabas retains a vicious streak, never forgiving and relentless in the kill. His only loyalties to his family aside, he is a well-mannered man consistently trapped in the mindset of an 18th-century Englishman.
** Justin Tracy as Young Barnabas
* [[Eva Green]] as [[Angelique Bouchard Collins|Angelique Bouchard]], a vengeful witch who plots a vendetta against Barnabas and his family.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; She wears a constantly false smile that resembles a smile of a [[Bisque doll|porcelain doll]] or glass figure, her face becomes cracked either when damaged or emotionally distraught, revealing a possibly hollow interior. She had spent two centuries using her immortal nature to ruin the Collins family name and give herself more power, posing as five successive generations of the "Bouchard Women".
** [[Raffey Cassidy]] as Young Angelique
* [[Bella Heathcote]] as [[Victoria Winters]], David's governess and Barnabas' love interest.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; Heathcote also plays the role of [[Josette du Pres]]. Victoria and [[Maggie Evans]]' roles in the original series were combined in the film, with Maggie choosing to adopt the name of Victoria after seeing a poster for winter sports in [[Victoria, British Columbia]] while on the train to Collinsport. As a child, Victoria was sent to a mental hospital by her parents for possessing the ability to see and speak to ghosts, only to escape and find refuge with the Collins family. She is from New York and has a very kind nature. She is mutually attracted to Barnabas, but initially recoils after discovering his true nature. After being cursed by Angelique, she ultimately decides that the only way for her and Barnabas to be together is for him to turn her into a vampire as well.
** Alexia Osborne as Young Victoria
* [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as [[Elizabeth Collins Stoddard]], the family matriarch.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; Stern and strict, but loyal and devoted to her family, Elizabeth cares for every member of the household and tends to help them through their personal trials. To "endure" as they always have, she isn't afraid to stand up for herself.
* [[Jonny Lee Miller]] as Roger Collins, Elizabeth's "[[wikt:ne'er-do-well|ne'er-do-well]]" brother.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; Larcenous and greedy, Roger often takes advantage of what he can through theft, trickery or bribery. When Barnabas catches him snooping around for the secret passage, he offers Roger a choice, either stay at Collinwood and be an exemplary father to his son David, or leave with the money to live on. The selfish man chooses the latter, hurting David at his departure.
* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Julia Hoffman|Dr. Julia Hoffman]], the family's live-in psychiatrist, hired to deal with David and his belief in ghosts.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; Somewhat vain and losing to her aging, she takes it upon herself to receive transfusions from Barnabas (under the guise of trying to cure him). She is often drunk or taking pills. Barnabas woos her into having a crush on him, often taking advantage of his naive nature without regarding the possible consequence of betraying him.
* [[Jackie Earle Haley]] as [[Willie Loomis]], the manor's caretaker.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; He becomes Barnabas' servant through [[hypnosis]]; he retains his own mindset, but follows his master's will instantly.
* [[Chloë Grace Moretz]] as [[Carolyn Stoddard]], Elizabeth's rebellious teenage daughter.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; She offers Barnabas advice on love, music, and insight into the current era. She wants to run away to New York when she turns 16, but her mother constantly forbids it. She also turns out to be a werewolf, as she was bitten by a werewolf sent by Angelique when she was a baby.
* [[Gulliver McGrath|Gully McGrath]] as [[David Collins (Dark Shadows)|David Collins]], Roger's "precocious" 10-year-old son, who can see his mother's ghost, who was killed by Angelique at sea.&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt;

==Production==
In July 2007, [[Warner Bros.]] acquired film rights for the gothic soap opera ''[[Dark Shadows]]'' from the estate of its creator [[Dan Curtis]]. [[Johnny Depp]] had a childhood obsession with ''Dark Shadows'', calling it a "dream" to portray Barnabas Collins, and ended up persuading Burton to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fleming | first=Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117969246 | title=Depp lights up 'Dark Shadows' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's development was delayed by the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]]. After the strike was resolved, Tim Burton was attached to direct the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kroll | first=Justin | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118031422 | title='Dark Shadows' ready for the light | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=February 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2009, screenwriter [[John August]] was writing a screenplay for ''Dark Shadows''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Siegel | first=Tatiana | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117998904 | title=John August to pen 'Preacher' film | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=January 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, author and screenwriter [[Seth Grahame-Smith]] replaced August in writing the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McNary | first=Dave | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118021794 | title=WB moves on Depp's 'Shadow' | journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=July 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; August did, however, receive story credit with Smith for his contribution to the film. Filming began in May 2011. It was filmed entirely in England, at both [[Pinewood Studios]] and on location.&lt;ref name="begins"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=77724 | title=Filming Begins on Tim Burton's ''Dark Shadows'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depp attempted to emulate the "rigidity" and "elegance" of Jonathan Frid's original Barnabas Collins, but also drew inspiration from [[Max Schreck]]'s performance in ''[[Nosferatu]]''.&lt;ref name="radish"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/johnny-depp-tim-burton-dark-shadows-interview/164615/|title=Johnny Depp and Tim Burton Talk DARK SHADOWS, Pulling from the TV Series, Deleted Scenes, a Sequel and More|author=Radish, Christina|publisher=Collider|date=May 8, 2012|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional crew members and Burton regulars are production designer [[Rick Heinrichs]], costume designer [[Colleen Atwood]], editor [[Chris Lebenzon]] and composer [[Danny Elfman]].&lt;ref name="begins" /&gt; French cinematographer [[Bruno Delbonnel]]&amp;nbsp;— known for his work in ''[[Amélie]]'', ''[[A Very Long Engagement]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''&amp;nbsp;— worked on the project.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed $79,727,159 in the United States and Canada, along with $165.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $245.5 million.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; For a Burton film, ''Dark Shadows'' achieved below-average domestic box office takings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/05/johnny-depp-dark-shadows-tim-burton-box-office.html|title='Dark Shadows': Has America fallen out of love with Johnny Depp? - latimes.com|author=Zeitchik, Steven|date=May 14, 2012|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many commentators attributing that to the domination of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref name="EOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eonline.com/news/avengers_assembles_1_billion_box_office/315839|title=The Avengers Assembles $1 Billion at Box Office, Overshadows Johnny Depp's Dark Shadows - E!

===Critical response===
''Dark Shadows'' has received mixed &lt;!--Both RT (5.3/10) and MC (55/100) scores are considered as mixed--&gt;reviews from film critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 37%, based on 233 reviews, with an average rating of 5.3/10. The site's critical consensus reads: "The visuals are top notch but Tim Burton never finds a consistent rhythm, mixing campy jokes and gothic spookiness with less success than other Johnny Depp collaborations."&lt;ref name="rotten tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dark-shadows-2010/|title=''Dark Shadows''|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|work=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 42 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dark-shadows|title=Dark Shadows Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More - Metacritic|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics felt that the film lacked a focused or consistent plot or [[genre]] (as either [[Horror film|horror]], [[Comedy film|comedy]] or [[Drama film|drama]])&lt;ref name="TWP" /&gt; pointing to Grahame-Smith's script, and that some jokes fell flat.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://horror.about.com/od/2012theatricalreviews/fr/Dark-Shadows-Movie-Review.htm |title=Dark Shadows Movie Review - Tim Burton Film Starring Johnny Depp |author=Harris, Mark H |publisher=[[About.com]] |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further claimed that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's collaborations have become tired.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/back-for-another-bite-20120512-1yixi.html|title=Dark Shadows: Johnny Depp, Tim Burton: Film, Movie Review, Trailer |author=Gibbs, Ed |date=May 13, 2012 |publisher=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', [[Fairfax Media]] |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://screencrush.com/tim-burton-johnny-depp-divorce/ |title=The Magic is Gone: Tim Burton and Johnny Depp Need to Divorce |author=Hayes, Britt |publisher=ScreenCrush |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the same, and other reviewers, however, noted its visual style was impressive.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RS" /&gt;

Positive reviewers, on the other hand, opined that the film ''did'' successfully translate the mood of the soap opera,&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; also acclaiming the actors—most notably Depp as Barnabas, who several said was the stand-out character due to his humorous [[culture shock]],&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt; as well as Pfeiffer&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ign.com/articles/2012/05/09/dark-shadows-review-2 |title=Dark Shadows Review - IGN |author=Vejvoda, Jim |date=May 9, 2012 |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and their characters; and further, that the film's '70s culture [[pastiche]] worked to its advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/tim-burtons-dark-shadows-full-whimsy-camp-11341608.html |title=Tim Burton's 'Dark Shadows' Full of Whimsy and Camp - Yahoo!

[[Roger Ebert]] said, "[The film] offers wonderful things, but they aren't what's important. It's as if Burton directed at arm's length, unwilling to find juice in the story." Ebert later noted that "Much of the amusement comes from Depp's reactions to 1970s pop culture," eventually concluding that the film "begins with great promise, but then the energy drains out," giving it two and a half stars out of four.&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120509/REVIEWS/120509983 |title=Dark Shadows :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=rogerebert.com, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |date=May 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manohla Dargis]], writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that it "isn't among Mr. Burton's most richly realized works, but it's very enjoyable, visually sumptuous and, despite its [[Melancholia|lugubrious]] source material and a sporadic tremor of violence, surprisingly effervescent," and opined in a mostly positive review that Burton's "gift for deviant beauty and laughter has its own liberating power."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/05/11/movies/johnny-depp-stars-in-tim-burtons-dark-shadows.html?smid=tw-nytimesmovies&amp;seid=auto |title=Johnny Depp Stars in Tim Burton's 'Dark Shadows' - NYTimes.com |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |first=Manohla |last=Dargis |date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] gave the film a mixed two and a half stars, claiming, "After a fierce and funny start, ''Dark Shadows'' simply spins its wheels," and adding that "the pleasures of ''Dark Shadows'' are frustratingly hit-and-miss. In the end, it all collapses into a spectacularly gorgeous heap."&lt;ref name="RS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/dark-shadows-20120510 |title=Dark Shadows - Movie Reviews |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Ann Hornaday dismissed the film, awarding it just one and a half stars, explaining that "Burton's mash-up of post-'60s [[kitsch]] and modern-day knowingness strikes a chord that is less self-aware than fatally self-satisfied. ''Dark Shadows'' doesn't know where it wants to dwell: in the eerie, subversive [[Umbra|penumbra]] suggested by its title or in playful, go-for-broke [[Camp (style)|camp]]."&lt;ref name="TWP"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/movies/dark-shadows-an-imax-3d-experience,1229895/critic-review.html |title=Critic Review for Dark Shadows: An IMAX 3D Experience on washingtonpost.com |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Corliss]] in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' pointed out that "[Burton]'s affection is evident, and his homage sometimes acute," and reasoned: "All right, so Burton has made less a revival of the old show than a hit-or-miss parody pageant," but praised the star power of the film, relenting that "attention must be paid to movie allure, in a star like Depp and his current harem. Angelique may be the only [[Satanist]] among the women here, but they're all bewitching."&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/05/10/johnny-depp-in-tim-burtons-dark-shadows-death-warmed-over/ |title=Johnny Depp in Tim Burton's Dark Shadows: Death Warmed Over |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Bradshaw]], in the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', weighed the film in a mixed write-up, giving it three stars out of five, and pointing out his feeling that "the Gothy, jokey 'darkness' of Burton's style is now beginning to look very familiar; he has built his brand to perfection in the film marketplace, and it is smarter and more distinctive than a lot of what is on offer at the multiplex, but there are no surprises. There are shadows, but they conceal nothing."&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/10/dark-shadows-review |title=Dark Shadows – review |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |location=London |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Burton was asked if he thought that this could be a possible start to a franchise, he replied, "No. Because of the nature of it being like a soap opera, that was the structure. It wasn't a conscious decision. First of all, it's a bit presumptuous to think that. If something works out, that's one thing, but you can't ever predict that. [The ending] had more to do with the soap opera structure of it."&lt;ref name=radish/&gt;

'''Donner Pass''' (el. {{convert|7056|ft|m|abbr=on}})&lt;ref&gt;Gannett, Henry. ''A Dictionary of Altitudes in the United States'' (3rd Edition), Bulletin of the U.S. Geological Survey, No. 160, Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., 1899. p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[mountain pass]] in the northern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], above [[Donner Lake]] about {{convert|9|mi|km}} west of [[Truckee, California]]. Like the Sierra Nevada mountains themselves, the pass has a steep approach from the east and a gradual approach from the west.

The pass has been used by the [[California Trail]], [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], [[Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad)|Overland Route]], [[Lincoln Highway]] and [[Victory Highway]] (both later [[U.S. Route 40 in California|U.S. Route 40]] and still later Donner Pass Road), as well as indirectly by [[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]].

Today the area is home to a thriving recreational community with several [[Paternoster lake|alpine lakes]] and ski resorts ([[Donner Ski Ranch]], [[Boreal Mountain Resort|Boreal]], and [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort|Sugar Bowl]]). The permanent communities in the area include [[Kingvale, California|Kingvale]] and [[Soda Springs, Nevada County, California|Soda Springs]], as well as the larger community below the pass surrounding Donner Lake.

==History==
To reach [[California]] from the east, pioneers had to get their wagons over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range.  In 1844 the [[Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party]] followed the [[Truckee River]] into the mountains.  At the head of what is now called [[Donner Lake]], they found a low notch in the mountains and became the first overland settlers to use the pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westerly-journies.com/goldrush/goldsteph-murphy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222081651/http://westerly-journies.com/goldrush/goldsteph-murphy.html|archivedate=2007-02-22|title=Opening of the California Trail|first=Lee|last=Clegg|work=High Sierra History|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pass was named after a later group of California-bound settlers.  In early November 1846 the [[Donner Party]] found the route blocked by snow and was forced to spend the winter on the east side of the mountains.  Of the 81 settlers, only 45 survived to reach California;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Utah Crossroads|title=Donner Party: Statistics|url=http://www.utahcrossroads.org/DonnerParty/Statistics.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of them resorting to [[cannibalism]] to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/america-the-story-of-us|work=America The Story Of Us |title=Westward|publisher=History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=George R.|title=Ordeal by Hunger: The Story of the Donner Party|edition= Third|publisher= Houghton-Mifflin|location= New York|date= 1963|pages= 132, et seq.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 1952, 222 passengers and crew aboard a train became stranded about {{convert|17|mi|km}} west of Donner Pass at [[Yuba Pass]], on Track #1 adjacent to Tunnel 35 (on Track #2), at about MP 176.5. [[Southern Pacific Railroad]]'s passenger train ''[[City of San Francisco (train)|City of San Francisco]]'' was en route westbound through the gap when a blizzard dumped so much snow the train was unable to move forward or reverse.

[[File:Donner Pass Summit Tunnel West Portal.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Summit Tunnel, West Portal ''(Composite image with the tracks removed in 1993 digitally restored)'']]In the spring of 1868, the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] were finally "conquered" by the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] (CPRR), after almost five years of sustained construction effort, with the successful completion at Donner Pass of its 1,659-foot (506 m) Tunnel #6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Sierra_Grade_8-2003/Donner_Pass-Summit_Tunnel/index.html|title=CPRR Summit Tunnel (#6), Tunnels #7 &amp; #8, Snowsheds, "Chinese" Walls, Donner Trail, and Dutch Flat Donner – Lake Wagon Road at Donner Pass|work=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and associated grade, thus permitting the establishment of commercial transportation ''en masse'' of passengers and freight over the Sierra for the first time. Following a route first surveyed and proposed by CPRR's original Chief Engineer, [[Theodore Judah|Theodore D. Judah]] (1826–1863), the construction of the four tunnels, several miles of snowsheds and two "Chinese Walls"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Tunnels.html |title=Tunnels of the Pacific Railroad|journal=Van Nostrand's Eclectic Engineering Magazine|volume=II|year=1870|pages=418–423|first=John R.|last=Gilliss}}&lt;/ref&gt; necessary to breach Donner Summit constituted the most difficult engineering and construction challenge of the original [[Sacramento]]-[[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] CPRR route.
   
[[Image:Lmc tdj.jpg|thumb|right|225px|CPRR Engineers L.M. Clement and T.D. Judah]]
Principally designed and built under the personal, often on-site direction of CPRR's Chief Assistant Engineer, Lewis M. Clement (1837–1914),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lewis Metzler Clement: A Pioneer of the Central Pacific Railroad|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Lewis_Metzler_Clement.html|publisher=Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original (Track 1) summit grade remained in daily use from June 18, 1868, when the first CPRR passenger train ran through the Summit Tunnel, until 1993 when the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (SP) (which operated the CPRR-built [[Oakland]]-[[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] line until its 1996 merger with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP)) abandoned the 6.7 mile (10.7&amp;nbsp;km) section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1) and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8), one mile east of the old [[Flying junction|flyover]] at [[Eder, California|Eder]]. All traffic has since operated over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit {{convert|1|mi|km}} south of Donner Pass through the {{convert|10322|ft|m|adj=on}}-long Tunnel #41 running under [[Mount Judah]] between Soda Springs and Eder. SP made this change because the railroad considered Track 2 and Tunnel 41 (which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was finally double tracked) to be easier and less expensive to maintain during in the harsh Sierra winters than the Track 1 tunnels and [[snow shed]]s over the summit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cooper, Bruce C.|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Sierra_Grade_8-2003/Donner_Pass-Summit_Tunnel/index.html |title=Summit Tunnel &amp; Donner Pass |publisher=CPRR.org |date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with major ongoing upgrades and expansions being made to the [[Port of Oakland]] in order to better accommodate the rapidly growing North American trade with Asia and the Pacific, the cooperation of UP, the Port's principal rail partner, has been sought to "construct a second track and raise tunnel clearances over Donner Pass for container trains linking California with the rest of the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portofoakland.com/newsroom/pressrel/view.asp?id=26 |title=Newsroom |publisher=Port of Oakland |date= |accessdate=2010-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126210226/http://portofoakland.com/newsroom/pressrel/view.asp?id=26 |archivedate=2010-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would likely require either a new parallel tunnel next to Tunnel 41 or the replacement of the summit section of Track 1 between the Norden complex and Shed 47; either would increase capacity and effectively eliminate delays currently caused by having to run all east and west bound traffic between Norden and Shed 47 over a single track. (To fully eliminate bottleneck delays the now single track {{convert|7.1|mi|km|adj=on}} section between Switch 9 (MP 171.9) at [[Emigrant Gap]] and Shed 10 (MP 179.0) west of Cisco would likely also have to be restored to double track.) Improvements were completed on the Sierra grade in November 2009, including increasing 18,000 lineal feet of tunnel clearances in 15 restricted tunnels between [[Rocklin, California|Rocklin]] and [[Truckee, California|Truckee]] and upgrading 30 miles of signals to CTC, although the original Donner Pass grade (Track 1) was not restored. Since then trains of full-height (20&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;inch) double-stack container cars have run over Donner Pass; some tunnels on Track 2 between Bowman and Colfax were not enlarged, so stack trains in both directions must use the older, tunnel-free Track 1 between those points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.railwayage.com/index.php/news/doublestacks-on-donner-pass.html|title=Doublestacks on Donner Pass|date=November 24, 2009|first=William C.|last=Vantuono|journal=Railway Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:I-80 altitude profile.png|thumb|Altitudes along a 100-mile stretch of the I-80, peaking at Donner saddle]]
The [[Lincoln Highway]], the first road across America, crosses Donner Pass; this was also a part of the [[Victory Highway]]. [[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] was built through this area in the early 1960s. I-80 generally parallels the route of US&amp;nbsp;40 through the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], but it crosses the Sierra crest at the '''Euer Saddle''', about {{convert|2|mi|km}} north of Donner Pass. Euer Saddle is referred to by [[CalTrans]] as '''"Donner Summit"''' at {{convert|7240|ft|m}} ({{coord | 39.339872 |-120.343958 |type:landmark |name=Donner Summit}}), located on the south side of I-80 at the Castle Peak exit beyond Boreal Inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohv.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=23055 |title=Donner Summit |publisher=ca.gov |access-date=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donner Summit is about {{convert|150|ft|m}} higher than Donner Pass, but is wider and has a gentler approach that aided construction to [[Interstate Highway standards]], which do not allow the sharp curves used by the Donner Pass Road. The [[Grade (slope)|grade]] is 3-6% for 30 miles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gonefcon.com/trucktcom/grade.htm |title= Grade Climb &amp; Descent Considerations|work=www.gonefcon.com |accessdate= 2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1920s highway has been preserved as a scenic alternative to I-80.

Ski resorts in the [[Lake Tahoe]] area report an average of {{convert|300|to|500|in|m|2}} of snowfall per season. Winds in the pass can also become extreme and wind gusts in  excess of {{convert|100|mph}} are common during [[winter storm]]s.  Winter temperatures in the area drop below {{convert|0|F|C|1|disp=or}} several times each year; the all-time record low for California of {{convert|-45|°F|°C|1|abbr=on}} was recorded at [[Boca, California|Boca]] (east of Truckee) in January 1937.

The winter of 1846–47 was especially severe, and this is generally cited as the single most important factor in the disaster of the [[Donner Party]].

==Recreation==
[[Image:Snowboarder cornice at sugarbowl.jpg|right|thumb|Snowboarder at [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort]] located near the top of Donner Pass]]

Summer and winter offer a wide variety of recreation and lifestyle sports such as [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], [[Alpine skiing|alpine]] and [[cross-country skiing]], [[Rock climbing|rock]] and [[ice climbing]]. The original tunnel built by Central Pacific Railroad is home to a large amount of [[Graffiti#Tagging|tagging]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mklibrary.com/hiking/donner-pass-summit-tunnel-hike/|title=Donner Pass Summit Tunnel Hike - MK Library|date=2017-07-21|work=MK Library|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The region was made world-famous during the early 1990s with [[snowboarding]] films by Fall Line Films (FLF) and Standard Films, for its easy access to frontcountry and [[backcountry]] terrain.   However, its fame and quick access from Old Highway 40 or nearby [[Sugar Bowl Ski Resort]] has led to a large number of avalanche fatalities, including professional snowboarder Jamil Khan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.mountainzone.com/news/khan.html |work=Mountain Zone News|title=Pro Snowboarder Jamil Khan Killed by Avalanche|date=1998-02-13 |accessdate=2010-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Redtape1.JPG|right|thumb|Red tape binds 19th century documents, the origin of phrase "[[red tape]]" to criticize economic interventionist laws and regulations]]

'''Economic interventionism''' (sometimes '''state interventionism''') is an [[Economic policy|economic policy perspective]]
favoring government intervention in the market process to correct the [[market failure]]s and promote the [[Public interest|general welfare of the people]]. An '''economic intervention''' is an action taken by a government or [[international institution]] in a [[market economy]] in an effort to impact the [[economics|economy]] beyond the basic regulation of [[fraud]] and enforcement of contracts and provision of [[public good]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karagiannis|first=Nikolaos|title=Key Economic and Politico-Institutional Elements of Modern Interventionism.|journal=Social and Economic Studies|year=2001|volume=50|issue=3/4|pages=17–47|jstor=27865245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="von Mises Ed.1998 10–12"&gt;{{cite book|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|title=Interventionism: An Economic Analysis|year=1998|publisher=[[The Foundation for Economic Education]]|location=New York|pages=10–12|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Mises09.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic intervention can be aimed at a variety of political or economic objectives, such as promoting economic growth, increasing employment, raising wages, raising or reducing prices, promoting [[Economic egalitarianism|income equality]], managing the money supply and interest rates, increasing profits, or addressing [[market failures]].

The term ''intervention'' assumes on a philosophical level that the state and economy should be inherently separated from each other;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lu|first=Catherine|title=Intervention|url=http://sage-ereference.com/view/politicaltheory/n233.xml?rskey=lrs7HL&amp;result=1&amp;q=intervention|work=Encyclopedia of Political Theory|publisher=SAGE|accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore the terminology applies to capitalist market-based economies where government action interrupts the market forces at play through regulations, economic policies or subsidies (however [[state-owned enterprises]] that operate in the market do not constitute an intervention). The term "intervention" is typically used by advocates of [[laissez-faire]] and [[free market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|title=Interventionism: An Economic Analysis|year=1998|publisher=The Foundation  for Economic Education, Inc|location=New York|pages=10–12|url=http://www.hacer.org/pdf/Mises09.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capitalist]] market economies that feature high degrees of state intervention are often referred to as [[Mixed economy|mixed economies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Brown|first= Douglas |title= Towards a Radical Democracy (Routledge Revivals): The Political Economy of the Budapest School |publisher= Routledge|date=November 11, 2011|isbn= 978-0415608794|pages = 10–11 |quote= The political definition refers to the degree of state intervention in what is basically a capitalist market economy. Thus this definition 'portray[s] the phenomenon in terms of state encroaching upon market and thereby suggest[s] that market is the natural or preferable mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political perspectives==
{{Progressivism}}
[[Libertarianism|Libertarians]], liberals and other advocates of free market or laissez-faire economics generally view government interventions as harmful, due to the law of [[unintended consequences]], belief in government's inability to effectively manage economic concerns, and other considerations. Government officials tend to be naturally disposed to seek more power and authority, and the money that usually goes with those things, and this quest often takes the form of economic interventionism which they then seek to justify. Many [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern liberals]] (in the United States) and contemporary [[social democrat]]s (in Europe) are inclined to support interventionism, seeing state economic interventions as an important means of promoting greater [[Income inequality|income equality]] and [[social welfare]]. Many center-right groups, such as [[Gaullism|Gaullist]]s and [[Christian Democracy|Christian Democrats]], also support state economic interventionism to promote social order and stability. Nationalist conservatives also frequently support economic interventionism as a means of protecting the power and wealth of a country or its people, particularly via advantages granted to industries seen as nationally vital.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Government interventions should be undertaken when potential benefits outweigh the (external) costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maziarz|first=Mariusz|date=2017|title=Ethics, Uncertainty, and Macroeconomics|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.18778/1899-2226.20.4.04|journal=Annales. Ethics in Economic Life|volume=20 |issue=4|pages=51–63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Marxists]] often feel that government welfare programs might interfere with the goal of overthrowing capitalism and replacing it with socialism, because a [[welfare state]] makes capitalism more tolerable to the average worker.&lt;ref name="Gamble et al"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierson|first=Chris|title=Marxism and Social Science |editor=Gamble |display-editors=etal |year=1999|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana and Chicago|pages=176–77 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.397.5282&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist]]s often criticize interventionism (as supported by social democrats and social liberals) as being untenable and liable to cause more economic distortion in the long-run. From this perspective, any attempt to "patch up" capitalism's contradictions would lead to distortions in the economy elsewhere, so that the only real and lasting solution is to entirely replace capitalism with a socialist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Schweickart, David. ''Democratic Socialism''. Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice (2006): http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm: "Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state – pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance.  They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down; etc.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Economic Policy - Intervention Strategy Matrix.png|thumb|350px|right|Typical intervention strategies under different conditions]]
The effects of government economic interventionism are widely disputed.

Regulatory authorities do not consistently close markets, yet as seen in economic liberalization efforts by states and various institutions ([[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]]) in [[Latin America]], "...financial liberalization and privatization coincided with democratization".&lt;ref name="Karagiannis 2001 19–21"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karagiannis|first=Nikolaos|title=Key Economic and Politico-Institutional Elements of Modern Interventionism|journal=Social and Economic Studies|year=2001|volume=50|issue=3/4|pages=19–21|jstor=27865245}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggests that after the [[La Década Perdida|lost decade]] an increasing "diffusion of regulatory authorities" emerged,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jordana|first=Jacint|author2=David Levi-Faur|title=The Diffusion of Regulatory Capitalism in Latin America: Sectoral and National Channels in the Making of a New Order|journal=[[Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]]|date=Mar 2005|volume=598|issue=The Rise of Regulatory Capitalism: The Global Diffusion of a new Order|pages=102–24|jstor=25046082|doi=10.1177/0002716204272587}}&lt;/ref&gt; these actors engaged in restructuring the economies within Latin America. Latin America through the 1980s had undergone a [[debt crisis]] and ''hyperinflation'' (during 1989 and 1990).

:"One of the first modern environmental protection laws enacted in the United States was the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (NEPA), which requires the government to consider the impact of its actions or policies on the environment. NEPA remains one of the most commonly used environmental laws in the nation. In addition to NEPA, there are numerous pollution-control statutes that apply to such specific environmental media as air and water. The best known of these laws are the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] (CAA), [[Clean Water Act]] (CWA), and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) commonly referred to as [[Superfund]]. Among the many other important pollution control laws are the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (RCRA), [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA), [[Oil Pollution Prevention Act]] (OPP), [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] (EPCRA), and the Pollution Prevention Act (PPA)."&lt;ref name="pollutionissues.com"&gt;[http://www.pollutionissues.com/Ho-Li/Laws-and-Regulations-United-States.html Laws and Regulations, United States].

the main reasons for policy intervention are to correct market failure,to ensure resources are allocated efficiently,etc.

United States pollution control statutes tend to be numerous and diverse, and many of the environmental statutes passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] are aimed at pollution prevention, they often need to be expanded and updated before their impact is fully realized. Pollution-control laws are generally too broad to be managed by existing legal bodies, so Congress must find or create an agency for each that will be able to implement the mandated mission effectively.&lt;ref name="pollutionissues.com"/&gt;

During [[World War I]], U.S government intervention mandated that the manufacturing of cars be replaced with machinery to successfully fight the war. Today government intervention could be used to break the U.S dependence on oil by mandating U.S automakers to produce electric cars such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]]. Recently, Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D) said, “We need help from Congress,” namely, renewing the clean energy manufacturing [[tax credit]] and the [[tax incentives]] that make plug-ins cheaper to buy for consumers.&lt;ref name="carbonoffsetsdaily.com"&gt;(August 3, 2010).

Unfortunately, current bills suggest carbon prices would only add a few cents to the price of gasoline, which has negligible effects, compared to what's needed to change fuel consumption.&lt;ref name="carbonoffsetsdaily.com"/&gt;

Currently, opponents believe that the carbon dioxide emissions tax, that the U.S. government introduced, on new cars that is unfair on consumers and looks like a revenue-raising fiscal intervention instead of limiting harm caused to the environment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;(August 13, 2010).

During [[George W. Bush]]’s 2000 campaign, he promised to commit $2 billion over 10 years to advance clean coal technology through research and development initiatives. According to Bush supporters, he fulfilled that promise in his fiscal year 2008 budget request, allocating $426 million for the [[Clean Coal Technology]] Program.&lt;ref name="indypendent.org"&gt;(June 7, 2007).

The coal industry received $9 billion in subsidies under the act, as part of an initiative supposedly to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and reduce carbon emissions. This included $6.2 billion for new power plants, $1.1 billion in tax breaks to install pollution-control technology and another $1.1 billion to make coal a cost efficient fuel. The act also allowed redefinitions of coal processing, such as spraying on diesel or starch, to qualify them as “non-traditional,” allowing coal producers to avoid paying $1.3 billion in taxes per year.&lt;ref name="indypendent.org"/&gt;

The [[Waxman-Markey]] bill, also called the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], passed by the [[House Energy and Commerce Committee]] in 2010, targets dramatic CO2 reductions after 2020, when the price of the permits would rise to further limit consumers’ demand for CO2-intensive goods and services.

The '''''Enterprise''''' was a United States merchant vessel&lt;ref&gt;Variously described in sources as a [[schooner]], [[brig]] or [[brigantine]]&lt;/ref&gt; active in the [[coastwise slave trade]] in the early 19th century along the Atlantic Coast. Bad weather forced it into [[Hamilton, Bermuda]] waters on February 11, 1835 while it carried 78 slaves in addition to other cargo. It became the centre of a minor international incident when the British authorities freed nearly all the slaves. Britain had abolished slavery in its Caribbean colonies effective 1834. At that time it advised "foreign nations that any [[slave ships|slavers]] found in Bermuda [and the Bahamas] waters would be subject to arrest and seizure. Their cargoes were liable to forfeiture" without compensation.&lt;ref name="forfeit"/&gt;

Bermuda customs officers called a gunboat and [[Royal Navy]] forces to detain the ''Enterprise'' ship so that the slaves could be freed. [[Richard Tucker (Bermuda)|Richard Tucker]] of the local [[Friendly Society]] served the captain with a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]],'' ordering him to deliver the slaves to the Bermuda Supreme Court so they could speak as to their choice of gaining freedom in the colony or returning with the ship to slavery in the United States. The court met from 9 p.m. to midnight on February 18, and the Chief Justice interviewed each slave. Seventy-two of the seventy-eight slaves from the ''Enterprise'' chose to stay in Bermuda and gain freedom.

The freeing of the slaves from ''Enterprise'' was one of several similar incidents from 1830 to 1842: officials in Bermuda and [[the Bahamas]] freed a total of nearly 450 slaves from United States ships in the domestic trade, after the ships had been wrecked in their waters or entered their ports for other reasons. United States owners kept pressing the government for claims for their losses. In the [[1853 Treaty of Claims]], the US and Britain agreed to settle a variety of claims dating to 1814, including those for slaves freed after 1834. This was ultimately settled by arbitration in 1855, establishing a payment of $270,700 against the US Government, due British subjects, and $329,000 against the British Government, due to American citizens. Ultimately some insurance companies were paid for the loss of property of the slaves.

==Background==
Both the United States and Great Britain had banned the international slave trade since 1807, and both operated sailing patrols off Africa (Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]]) and in the Caribbean to intercept illegal vessels and suppress the trade. The United States in its legislation preserved the right to operate ships for its domestic [[coastwise slave trade]] among various markets along the East and Gulf coasts, which became increasingly important as the [[Deep South]] rapidly developed cotton cultivation. With labor demand at a height, in the antebellum years, nearly a million enslaved African Americans were moved to the Deep South in a forced migration, two-thirds through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans had the largest slave market and its port was important for the slave trade and related businesses.

In 1818,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z70-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=brig+Comet+1830&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y_uxAN54OM&amp;sig=l_3rV5PKNYcogWpkSE63wi4aWQ8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pclmUZ6CAcng2gWIy4CQAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=brig%20Comet%201830&amp;f=false Appendix: "Brigs Encomium and Enterprise"], ''Register of Debates in Congress,'' Gales &amp; Seaton, 1837, p. 251-253. Note: In trying to retrieve American slaves off the ''Encomium'' from British colonial officials (who freed them), the US consul in February 1834 was told by the Lieutenant Governor that "he was acting in regard to the slaves under an opinion of 1818 by [[Sir Christopher Robinson]] and Lord Gifford to the British Secretary of State."&lt;/ref&gt; the Home Office in London had ruled that "any slave brought to the [[Bahamas]] from outside the [[British West Indies]] would be manumitted."&lt;ref name="horne103"/&gt; This interpretation led to British colonial officials' freeing a total of nearly 450 slaves owned by U.S. nationals from 1830 to 1842, in incidents in which American merchant ships were wrecked in the Bahamas or put into colonial ports for other reasons.&lt;ref name="horne103"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&amp;dq=%22children+of+the+enterprise%22+musson&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Gerald Horne, ''Negro Comrades of the Crown: African Americans and the British Empire Fight the U.S. Before Emancipation''], New York University (NYU) Press, 2012, p. 103. Horne notes 300; more were freed when all five ships are considered.&lt;/ref&gt;  The American slave ship ''Comet'' was wrecked in 1830 off Abaco Island, as was the ''Encomium'' in February 1834. Customs officials seized the cargoes of slaves when brought into Nassau by wreckers, and colonial officials freed them: 164 slaves from the ''Comet'' and 45 from the ''Encomium''. Britain paid an indemnity to the US in those two cases, but only in 1855 under the Treaty of Claims of 1853. Additional slaves were liberated from American ships during the intervening years.&lt;ref&gt;Horne (2012), ''Negro Comrades of the Crown'', p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished]] slavery effective in August 1834 in the British Isles, most of its colonies and their waters. Since the emancipation, Britain had advised "foreign nations that any [[slave ships|slavers]] found in Bermuda [and the Bahamas] waters would be subject to arrest and seizure. Their cargoes were liable to forfeiture" without compensation.&lt;ref name="forfeit"/&gt;

==''Enterprise'' in Bermuda==
In February 1835, seven days out on a voyage between [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the American brig ''Enterprise'' was driven off-course by a hurricane and forced to put in for provisions at [[Hamilton, Bermuda]], a British colony.&lt;ref name="horne107-108"/&gt; When the customs officers arrived on the large, 127-ton ship on February 11,&lt;ref name="horne107-108"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XTLFKrmJPgcC&amp;dq=%22children+of+the+enterprise%22+musson&amp;q=%22Comet%22+slave+ship#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Comet%22%20slave%20ship&amp;f=false Horne (2012), ''Negro Comrades of the Crown''], pp. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt; they discovered that it held a total of 78 slaves, in what they reported were appalling conditions. The captives were not listed on the ship's manifest for cargo.&lt;ref name="forfeit"/&gt; Alexandria and Washington, DC comprised a major market for slaves from the Chesapeake Bay area, of Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, being sold and shipped to the Deep South. Most of the slaves on the ''Enterprise'' were owned by Joseph Neal, and they were highly valuable, as they were young, American-born and spoke English. They were listed as mostly between the ages of 7 and 15, and 19 to 25. There were a total of 41 females and 37 males.&lt;ref name="horne107-108"/&gt;

The customs officials told Captain Smith that the slaves were illegal in Bermuda and subject to forfeiture; they ordered him to bring them ashore. The British summoned a gunboat and Royal Navy forces to put the crew under armed guard.&lt;ref name="forfeit"/&gt; When Smith threatened to leave in defiance, local forces detained the Americans.

[[Richard Tucker (Bermuda)|Richard Tucker]] intervened; he was the Bermudian founder in 1832 of the local black [[Friendly Society|Young Men's Friendly Lodge]] (a mutual aid group).&lt;ref name="forfeit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bios"/&gt; He obtained a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' from the court compelling the captain, Elliot Smith, to bring the slaves "before the Chief Justice and answer for themselves whether they would proceed with the vessel to her destined port and continue slaves, or remain at Bermuda and be free."&lt;ref name="salem"/&gt;

Some 78 slaves, many of them women with children, were removed from the ship to prepare for their court hearing. By the time they landed at Barr's Bay Park near [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]], an "immense crowd" had gathered to greet them.&lt;ref name="forfeit"/&gt; Many of the crowd had been freed just the year before and were excited to think the American slaves might gain freedom.

The Bermuda Supreme Court convened at 9 p.m. on February 18 to interview the slaves.&lt;ref name="seizure"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4h4SAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq "Seizure of American Slaves in Bermuda"], ''New York Journal of Commerce'', reprinted from ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]]'' (Bermuda), collected in ''The African Repository'', volume 11, [[American Colonization Society]], 1835, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing lasted until midnight in a packed room; a large crowd of locals attended the session.&lt;ref name="bios"/&gt; Bermuda's Chief Justice Thomas Butterfield interviewed the slaves individually,&lt;ref name="bios"/&gt; and asked whether they wished to return to the US and slavery, or remain in Bermuda as free persons.&lt;ref name="seizure"/&gt; During this session, the Court heard that many of the people had been free blacks in Maryland that raiders had kidnapped and sold into slavery.&lt;ref name="forfeit"/&gt;

A woman named Ridgely, with her five children, chose to return to the United States. The remaining 72 people chose to stay in Bermuda. That night, on February 18, 1835, the Supreme Court freed them.&lt;ref name="bios"/&gt; A journalist present wrote, "It would be difficult to describe the sense of joy and wonderment that prevailed."&lt;ref name="horne107-108"/&gt;

The Attorney General initiated a subscription on behalf of the [[freedmen]], and $70 was quickly raised from attendees to help them.&lt;ref name="seizure"/&gt; Mayor William Cox of Hamilton offered them the use of a vacant storehouse as a place to sleep.&lt;ref name="bios"/&gt; Well-wishers and the [[Friendly Society]] aided the new freedmen in finding housing and jobs, and quickly integrating into local society.&lt;ref name="forfeit"&gt;[http://www.bermuda-online.org/history1800-1899.htm "1835.

The ''Enterprise'' case contributed to the tensions arising between Great Britain and the United States over the question of slavery during the period after it had been abolished in Britain and her colonies. The United States continued with it as a domestic trade and profitable institution in the South.&lt;ref name="salem"&gt;[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bmuwgw/salem20mar1835.htm "Another Seizure of American Slaves in Bermuda"], ''[[Salem Gazette]]'', 20 Mar 1835, reprinted from ''New York Journal of Commerce''&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of several incidents in which British officials in Bermuda or the West Indies freed slaves owned by Americans. While the US and Britain worked to suppress the international slave trade from Africa, the US wanted to protect its domestic slavers if weather or accidents drove them into British colonial ports. In the case of the ''Enterprise'' and other incidents, local British citizens took action on behalf of American slaves.

==Related incidents==
In 1840, ''[[Hermosa (slave ship)|Hermosa]]'', a US schooner in the [[coastwise slave trade]], carrying 38 slaves from Richmond to New Orleans for sale, went aground on one of the Abacos islands in the [[Bahamas]]. After [[Marine salvage|salvors]] took the ship to port, the captain refused to let the slaves off. With the US [[consul (representative)|consul]], he tried to arrange for another ship to take his slave cargo for delivery. British magistrates backed with armed force boarded ''Hermosa'', taking the slaves off and freeing them when they reached shore. The Americans protested.&lt;ref name="hermosa"/&gt;

The [[Creole Case]] gained notoriety as it resulted from a November 1841 [[slave revolt]] on an American brig. After 19 slaves took control of the crew of the ''Creole,'' they ordered the ship sailed to [[Nassau, Bahamas]]; one of the leaders had heard of the ''Hermosa'' case the year before and knew the British had abolished slavery. Ultimately, 128 of 135 slaves from the ''Creole'' were freed by the British colonists. It was the most successful slave revolt in US history.&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US was concerned not only about compensation for slaveholders' losses. It feared that the success of the ''Creole'' slaves would encourage others to attempt such ship revolts to reach freedom in the British West Indies, and threaten the coastwise slave trade and slavery in the South.

The US-British negotiations on the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] (1842) were underway at the time and partially resolved the international tensions. The [[Presidency of Martin Van Buren|Martin Van Buren administration]] had formally demanded the return of the American slaves from the ''Creole'', which Britain refused. Southern slaveholders continued to press Congress for compensation for their loss of "property."

In correspondence with US Secretary of State [[Daniel Webster]], the British diplomat [[Lord Ashburton]], while repeating that British law forbidding slavery was unalterable, assured Webster that, in the interest of 'good neighbourhood,' the Crown would inform the governors of the colonies on the southern borders of the United States against "officious interference" when chance drove American vessels into British jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/worksdanweb06websrich#page/316/mode/2up/search/ashburton "Letter from Lord Ashburton to Daniel Webster," in ''The Works of Daniel Webster''], vol.

Quote: "...Our Treaty on Claims with Great Britain: On motion of Mr. HOUSTON, the bill carrying into effect the treaty between the United States and Great Britain on the subject of claims, concluded February, 1853, was taken up...the commission provided for the payment of $270,700 against this Government, due British subjects, and $329,000 against the British Government, due to American citizens, requiring the money to be paid in one year from the expiration of the commission, which expired on the 15th of last month...The treaty has relation to slaves on board the ''Enterprise'' and ''Creole''.  The bill passed under the operation of the previous question."&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years following signing of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, the United States had no complaints against Britain related to emancipating slaves from American ships at Caribbean ports.&lt;ref name="liberation"/&gt; But, even if officials could be instructed to turn a blind eye, the residents of British colonies (many of whom had formerly been enslaved) sometimes took direct action to free American slaves.&lt;ref name="liberation"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1855/07/20/75801176.pdf "Liberation of the American Slave at Savanna la Mar"], ''New York Times'', 20 July 1855. Note: The newspaper discussed the international ramifications of a slave being taken off an American ship by Jamaican residents and being set free. It called for a lasting solution to be found by "the two governments interested".&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 1855, the ''New York Times'' reported that an American slave had been removed in late June by Jamaicans from the brig ''Young America'' at [[Savanna-la-Mar]], [[Jamaica]] and "set at large".&lt;ref name="liberation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1855/07/24/75801258.pdf "The Jamaica Negro Difficulty"], reprinted from ''Norfolk (Va.) Argus'', in ''New York Times'', 24 July 1855. Note: It includes "Letter to Collector of port of Norfolk from Consul R. Monroe Harrison, [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], Jamaica, dated 2 July 1855," warning shipmasters against allowing blacks to crew vessels putting into Jamaica because of frequent problems with desertion. In addition, Harrison refers to a recent incident:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...It is only a few days since that the brigantine ''Young America'', Capt. ROGERS of Baltimore, arrived at Savannah-la-Mar, when the black cook or steward, being desirous of getting rid of that vessel, and the master not wishing to let him go, a band of half-savage negroes went on board and took him out by force, and insulted the captain in the most shameful manner, while the magistrates looked on and countenanced the atrocious act....You would greatly oblige me if you would be pleased to caution masters of vessels against shipping negroes to come to any port in this island, as they are sure to have trouble."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the US Consul in Jamaica, the man in question had boarded the ''Young America'' with papers showing he was a free man named Nettles. Later he said his name was really Anderson, and he was a slave escaping from a Mr. Robinson. The Consul noted that, if this were true, Anderson would have become free "on touching British soil." The Consul had written to the Collector of the Port of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], advising shipmasters to avoid bringing black crew to Jamaica, because of their high rate of desertion at the island. He noted that it was difficult to recover deserters because of strong local opposition to slavery, as well as the US and Great Britain lacking any treaty applying to their recovery.&lt;ref name="letter"/&gt;

The '''Euratom Treaty''', officially the '''Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community''', established the [[European Atomic Energy Community]]. It was signed on 25 March 1957, at the same time as the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaty establishing the European Economic Community]] ([[European Economic Community|EEC]] Treaty).

The Euratom treaty is less well-known due to the lower profile of the organisation it founded. While the EEC has evolved into what is now the [[European Union]], Euratom has remained much the same as it was in 1957, albeit governed by the institutions of the European Union. It was established with its own independent institutions, but the 1967 [[Merger Treaty]] merged the institutions of Euratom and the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] with those of the EEC.

The Euratom treaty has seen very little amendment, due to the later sensitivity surrounding [[nuclear power]] amongst European [[public opinion]]. Owing to this, some argue that it has become too out-dated, particularly in the areas of democratic oversight. It was not included as part of the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], which sought to combine all previous treaties, over fears that including nuclear power in the treaty would turn more people against it. Nevertheless, it forms part of the active [[treaties of the European Union]].

After the [[Greek legislative election, 2007|legislative elections of 2007]], in which PASOK was soundly defeated, Venizelos announced his [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement leadership election, 2007|candidacy for the leadership]] of the party. In the leadership election, held on 11 November 2007, Venizelos was defeated by incumbent party leader [[George Andreas Papandreou|George Papandreou]], receiving 38.18% of the vote against 55.91% for Papandreou.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2007/07-11-15.ana.html#08 "George Papandreou wins PASOK leadership election with 55.91 pc"], Athens News Agency, 15 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

When named by Papandreou to the finance and deputy PM positions in June 2011, Venizelos said "'I am leaving defense today to go to the real battle' to reduce Europe’s biggest debt load – almost 1 1/2 times the size of its economy."&lt;ref&gt;Petrakis, Maria, and Natalie Weeks, [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-06-17/greek-new-finance-minister-venizelos-says-prepared-for-battle.html "Greek New Finance Minister Venizelos Says Prepared for Battle"], ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|Businessweek]]'', 17 June 2011, 11:29 AM EDT. Retrieved 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Marsh (Financial Specialist)|David Marsh]] of London and Oxford Capital Markets in ''[[MarketWatch]]'' wrote that both "German parliamentarians who voted solidly earlier this month to involve private-sector creditors in the next bail-out package", which [[Angela Merkel]] has now dropped as a precondition, and "Greece’s politicians and people, who must bow to further austerity as the price for fresh external support", were central as "the stage now shifts to further players in the theatre of Greek affairs." And "[n]obody knows whether the burly new Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos will put in a starring role or turn out merely as a transitory figure."&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, David, [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/for-greece-a-delicate-endgame-of-fingerpointing-2011-06-20?link=mw_story_kiosk "For Greece, a delicate endgame of fingerpointing "], ''MarketWatch'', 20 June 2011 12:01 a.m. EDT. Retrieved 21 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Venizelos was active in the [[Macedonia naming dispute]], when elements in Greece opposed the use of the name "Macedonia" by the newly independent neighbouring [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Columnist Mark Dragoumis of [[Athens News]] opined that, "[i]n February 1994, as minister of information, [Venizelos] was instrumental in convincing the ailing Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to impose that idiotic 'embargo' on the country later named FYROM." Dragoumis maintained that Venizelos' motivation was to gain "nationalist votes in his Thessaloniki constituency."&lt;ref name=MD01&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.athensnews.gr/old_issue/13255/16785|publisher=Athens News|author=Dragoumis, Mark|date=5 October 2007|accessdate=21 June 2011|title=Pasok's lost cause: 'Always oppose – never propose'|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403165127/http://www.athensnews.gr/old_issue/13255/16785|archivedate=3 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dragoumis also criticised Venizelos for helping pass a law – "in order to boost [his] popularity among Greek republicans" – to impose a requirement on [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II]], former king of the Hellenes, and his family if they wanted to be granted Greek nationality. The requirement was to submit a declaration that they "unreservedly respected the 1975 Constitution and accepted and recognised the Hellenic Republic." The columnist termed it a "silly precondition – reminiscent of the 'declarations of repentance' that Greek leftists were obliged to sign under pressure during the civil war and after."&lt;ref name=MD01/&gt; Ultimately, the law proved irrelevant once Greece signed the [[Schengen Agreement]] allowing the ex-king to travel to Greece via Italy without having to pass through Greek immigration.&lt;ref name=CY01&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.typos.com.cy/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=28195|publisher=typos.com.cy|date=16 February 2003|accessdate=26 November 2012|title=The ex-king Konstantine de-Grecia departed from Greece (in Greek)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Disaster Assistance Nonprofit Fairness Act of 2013''' ({{USBill|113|H.R.|592}}) is a bill that passed in the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].  The bill would make religious organizations and religious non-profits eligible to receive federal funding for repairs and rebuilding of their facilities after a major disaster.  The bill amends the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act]].

The bill passed the House by a large margin, but was criticized by opponents for using taxpayer money to help tax-exempt organizations and for violating the principle of [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]].

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=592sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 592 - 113th Congress|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/592|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill would amend the [[Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act|Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act]] to include community centers, including [[Tax exemption|tax-exempt]] houses of worship, as "private nonprofit facilities" for purposes of disaster relief and emergency assistance eligibility under such Act.

The amendment makes a [[Church (building)|church]], [[synagogue]], [[mosque]], [[temple]], or other [[Place of worship|house of worship]], and a private nonprofit facility operated by a religious organization, eligible for federal contributions for the repair, restoration, and replacement of facilities damaged or destroyed by a major disaster, without regard to the religious character of the facility or the primary religious use of the facility.

Finally, the bill makes the Act applicable to the provision of assistance in response to a major disaster or emergency declared on or after October 28, 2012.

==Procedural history==
===House===
The Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on February 8, 2013 by [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ)]].&lt;ref name=592actions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 592 - 113th Congress - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/592/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was immediately referred to the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]].  It was then referred to the [[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management]] on February 11, 2013.  On February 13, the Bill was considered on the House floor under a [[Suspension of the rules in the United States Congress|suspension of the rules]]; it passed later that day 354-72 ([http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll039.xml Roll Call Vote 39]).  By the time it had passed, the Bill had received 9 cosponsors in the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 592 - Cosponsors|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/592/cosponsors|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the 72 members who voted against the bill, 66 were [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 6 were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].

===Senate===
The Bill was received in the Senate on February 14, 2013.&lt;ref name="592actions" /&gt;  It was referred to the [[United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs]] on March 13, 2013.

==Debate==
Supporters of the Bill argued that the bill was necessary to clarify existing law by correcting an oversight.  The House Republican Majority's official website stated their view that "unlike previous disasters, Congress did not clarify that religious nonprofits, including houses of worship, are eligible to receive disaster funding when providing aid for victims and communities impacted by [[Hurricane Sandy]].  As a result, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|(Obama) Administration]] is interpreting current law to preclude houses of worship from being eligible for funding on the same terms as similarly impacted nonprofits."&lt;ref name=592gop&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 592 Legislative Digest GOP.gov|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr592|publisher=House Republicans|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other supporters of federal funding for houses of worship damaged in disasters have argued that such places a key parts of communities and are not exempted from other aspects of government disaster management, like evacuation orders or emergency fortification attempts, and therefore should not be prevented from seeking disaster relief.&lt;ref name=WSJschick1&gt;{{cite news|last=Schick|first=Avi|title=Separation of Church and State, Disaster Edition|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324039504578261581899619590|accessdate=April 23, 2013|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the Bill argued that the Obama Administration is right to deny funds to religious institutions; this argument was often made on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] grounds.&lt;ref name=CFI1&gt;{{cite web|title=Why CFI Opposed H.R. 592|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/why_cfi_opposed_h.r._592/|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ConDish1"/&gt;  The non-profit [[Center for Inquiry]] wrote on its website that they opposed the Bill because they believed it violated the First Amendment's prohibition against government establishing any religion.&lt;ref name="CFI1"/&gt;  The Center for Inquiry argued that "true religious freedom protects the conscience of the taxpayer by ensuring that his or her money is not used to support or advance religion with which he or she may disagree."&lt;ref name="CFI1"/&gt;  One blogger referred to the act as the "Taxpayer Money to Tax-Exempt Churches Act".&lt;ref name=ConDish1&gt;{{cite web|last=Briney|first=Jennifer|title=H.R. 592: Taxpayer Money to Tax-Exempt Churches Act|url=http://www.congressionaldish.com/h-r-592-taxpayer-money-to-tax-exempt-churches-act/|publisher=Congressional Dish|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The group [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] also argued against the Bill, writing on their website that "Church-state separation protects the right of taxpayers to support only the religious institutions of their choice, and it ensures the independence and integrity of faith communities. Houses of worship exist primarily to teach the tenets of their religion. They should be supported by donations, not government subsidies."&lt;ref name=AU1&gt;{{cite web|title=Should We Be Asked To Pay For Rebuilding Houses Of Worship?|url=https://www.au.org/content/should-we-be-asked-to-pay-for-rebuilding-houses-of-worship|publisher=Americans United|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Bulgarian Empire''' ([[Old Bulgarian]]: ц︢рьство бл︢гарское, ''ts'rstvo bl'garskoe'') was a [[Middle ages|medieval]] [[Bulgaria]]n [[State (polity)|state]] that existed in southeastern [[Europe]] between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded in 681 when [[Bulgars|Bulgar tribes]] led by [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Asparuh]] moved to the north-eastern [[Balkans]]. There they secured [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] recognition of their right to settle south of the [[Danube]] by [[Battle of Ongal|defeating]]{{snds}}possibly with the help of local [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] tribes{{snds}}the Byzantine army led by [[Constantine IV]]. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the [[Danube Bend]] to the [[Black Sea]] and from the [[Dnieper]] River to the [[Adriatic Sea]].

As the state solidified its position in the Balkans, it entered into a centuries-long interaction, sometimes friendly and sometimes hostile, with the Byzantine Empire. Bulgaria emerged as Byzantium's chief antagonist to its north, resulting in [[Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars|several wars]]. The two powers also enjoyed periods of peace and alliance, most notably during the [[Second Arab siege of Constantinople]], where the Bulgarian army broke the siege and destroyed the Arab army, thus preventing an Arab invasion of [[Southeastern Europe]]. [[Byzantium]] had a strong cultural influence on Bulgaria, which also led to the eventual [[Christianization of Bulgaria|adoption of Christianity]] in 864. After the disintegration of the [[Avar Khaganate]], the country expanded its territory northwest to the [[Pannonian Plain]]. Later the Bulgarians confronted the advance of the [[Pechenegs]] and [[Cumans]], and achieved a decisive victory over the [[Magyars]], forcing them to establish themselves permanently in [[Pannonia]].

During the late 9th and early 10th centuries, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] achieved a string of victories over the Byzantines. Thereafter, he was recognized with the title of Emperor, and proceeded to expand the state to its greatest extent.  After the annihilation of the Byzantine army in the [[Battle of Achelous (917)|battle of Anchialus]] in 917, the Bulgarians laid siege to [[Constantinople]] in 923 and 924. The Byzantines, however, eventually recovered, and in 1014, under [[Basil II]], inflicted a crushing defeat on the Bulgarians at the [[Battle of Kleidion]]. By 1018, the last Bulgarian strongholds had surrendered to the Byzantine Empire, and the First Bulgarian Empire had ceased to exist. It was succeeded by the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] in 1185.

After the adoption of [[Christianity]], Bulgaria became the cultural center of [[Slavic Europe]]. Its leading cultural position was further consolidated with the invention of the [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] and [[Early Cyrillic alphabet]]s shortly after in the capital [[Preslav]], and literature produced in [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]] soon began spreading north. Old Bulgarian became the [[lingua franca]] of much of Eastern Europe and it came to be known as [[Old Church Slavonic]]. In 927, the fully independent [[Bulgarian Patriarchate]] was officially recognized.

The Bulgars and other non-Slavic tribes in the empire gradually adopted an essentially foreign Slavic [[Old Bulgarian|language]]. Since the late 9th century, the names ''Bulgarians'' and ''Bulgarian'' gained prevalence and became permanent designations for the local population, both in literature and in common parlance. The development of Old Church Slavonic literacy had the effect of preventing the assimilation of the [[South Slavs]] into neighbouring cultures, while stimulating the formation of a distinct Bulgarian identity.

{{History of Bulgaria}}
The First Bulgarian Empire became known simply as ''Bulgaria''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1930|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; since its recognition by the Byzantine Empire in 681. Some historians use the terms ''Danube Bulgaria'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vladimirov|first=G.|title=Danube Bulgaria and Volga Bulgaria|publisher=Orbel|year=2005|location=|page=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''First Bulgarian State'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John V.

== Background ==

=== The Balkans during the early Migration Period ===
{{see also|Thracians|Migration Period}}
Parts of the eastern [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]] was in antiquity inhabited by the [[Thracians]] who were a group of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Webber|first=Cristopher|author2=Angus McBride |title=The Thracians, 700 BC–AD 46|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2001|location=|page=14|isbn=1-84176-329-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole region as far north as the [[Danube]] River was gradually incorporated into the [[Roman Empire]] by the 1st century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of the Roman Empire after the 3rd century AD and the continuous invasions of [[Goths]] and [[Huns]] left much of the region devastated, depopulated and in economic decline by the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving eastern half of the Roman Empire, called by later historians the [[Byzantine Empire]], could not exercise effective control in these territories other than in the coastal areas and certain cities in the interior. Nonetheless, it never relinquished the claim to the whole region up to the Danube. A series of administrative, legislative, military and economic reforms somewhat improved the situation but despite these reforms disorder continued in much of the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reign of Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r.{{nbsp}}527–565) saw temporary recovery of control and reconstruction of a number of fortresses but after his death the empire was unable to face the threat of the Slavs due to the significant reduction of revenue and manpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slavic migrations to the Balkans ===
{{Main article|South Slavs}}
The [[Slavs]], of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] origin, were first mentioned in written sources to inhabit the territories to the north of the Danube in the 5th century AD but most historians agree that they had arrived earlier.&lt;ref name="fine25"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of Slavs that came to be known as the [[South Slavs]] was divided into [[Antes (people)|Antes]] and [[Sclaveni]] who spoke the same language.&lt;ref name="fine25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cambr2005134"&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 1|2005|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Slavic incursions in the Balkans increased during the second half of Justinian I's reign and while these were initially pillaging raids, large-scale settlement began in the 570s and 580s.&lt;ref name="cambr2005134"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This migration is associated with the arrival of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] who settled in the plains of [[Pannonia]] between the rivers Danube and [[Tisza]] in the 560s subjugating various Bulgar and Slavic tribes in the process.&lt;ref name="cambr2005134"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumed in bitter wars with the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] [[Sasanian Empire]] in the east, the Byzantines had little resources to confront the Slavs.&lt;ref name="fine30"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 1|2005|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Slavs came in large numbers and the lack of political organisation made it very difficult to stop them because there was no political leader to defeat in battle and thereby force their retreat.&lt;ref name="fine30"/&gt; As the wars with Persia persisted, the 610s and 620s saw a new and even larger migration wave with the Slavs penetrating further south into the Balkans, reaching [[Thessaly]], [[Thrace]] and [[Peloponnese]] and raiding some islands in the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines held out [[Thessaloniki|Salonica]] and a number of coastal towns but beyond these areas the imperial authority in the Balkans disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Bulgars ===
[[File:Old Great Bulgaria and migration of Bulgarians.png|thumb|left|250px|The Bulgarian colonies after the fall of Old Great Bulgaria in the 7th century.]]
[[File:The Bulgarian expansion south of the Danube after the victorious battle of Ongal 681ad.jpg|thumb|Bulgaria under the rulership of Asparuh]]
{{Main article|Bulgars|Old Great Bulgaria}}
The [[Bulgars]] were semi-[[nomad]]ic warrior tribes originating from [[Central Asia]] whose exact ethnic origin is controversial. They spoke a form of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] language and during their migration westwards they absorbed other ethnic groups and cultural influences, including [[Huns|Hunnic]], [[Iranian people|Iranian]] and Indo-European people.{{sfn|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=229|ps=: "The exact ethnic origins of the Danubian Bulgars is controversial. It is in any case most probable that they had enveloped groupings of diverse origins during their migration westwards across the Eurasian steppes, and they undoubtedly spoke a form of Turkic as their main language. The Bulgars long retained many of the customs, military tactics, titles and emblems of a nomadic people of the steppes."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84090/Bulgaria/42718/Sport-and-recreation#toc42721 |title=Bulgaria: Arrival of the Bulgars |author-link= |date= |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |access-date=26 January 2017 |quote=The name Bulgaria comes from the Bulgars, a people who are still a matter of academic dispute with respect to their origin (Turkic or Indo-European) as well as to their influence on the ethnic mixture and the language of present-day Bulgaria.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgars included the tribes of [[Onogurs]], [[Utigur]]s and [[Kutrigur]]s, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sophoulis|first=Panos|date=2011|title=Byzantium and Bulgaria, 775–831|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EbIyAQAAQBAJ|publisher=Brill|page=89|isbn=9789004206960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clear mention of the Bulgars in written sources dates from 480, when they served as the allies of the Byzantine Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] (r. 474–491) against the [[Ostrogoths]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|1992|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; although an obscure reference to ''Ziezi ex quo Vulgares'', with [[Ziezi]] being an offspring of Biblical [[Shem]], son of [[Noah]], is in the ''[[Chronography of 354]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|1992|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 490s the Kutrigurs had moved west of the [[Black Sea]] while the Utigurs inhabited the steppes to the east of them. In the first half of the 6th century the Bulgars occasionally raided the Byzantine Empire but in the second half of the century the Kutrigurs were subjugated by the [[Avar Khaganate]] and the Utigurs came under the rule of the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|1992|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the power of the Western Turks faded in the 600s the Avars reasserted their domination over the Bulgars. Between 630 and 635 [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Kubrat]] of the [[Dulo clan]] managed to unite the main Bulgar tribes and to declare independence from the Avars, creating a powerful confederation called [[Old Great Bulgaria]], also known as '' Patria Onoguria'', between the Black Sea, the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref name="fine44"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|1992|pp=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kubrat, who was baptised in [[Constantinople]] in 619, concluded an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] (r. 610–641) and the two countries remained in good relations until Kubrat's death between 650 and 663.&lt;ref name="fine44"/&gt; Kubrat fought with the [[Khazars]] in the east but after his demise Old Great Bulgaria disintegrated under strong Khazar pressure in 668&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curta|2008|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his five sons parted with their followers. The eldest [[Batbayan]] remained in his homeland as Kubrat's successor and eventually became a Khazar vassal. The second brother [[Kotrag]] migrated to the middle [[Volga]] region and founded [[Volga Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|1992|pp=245–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third brother [[Asparuh of Bulgaria|Asparuh]] led his people west to the lower Danube.&lt;ref name="fine44"/&gt; The fourth one, [[Kuber]], initially settled in Pannonia under Avar suzerainty but revolted and moved to the region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], while the fifth brother [[Alcek]] settled in central [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golden|1992|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whittow270"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment and consolidation ===
[[File:First Bulgarian Empire by Asparuh to Kardam (680- 803).png|250px|alt=A map of the Bulgarian Empire in the late 7th and 8th centuries|thumb|Bulgaria at the turn of the 7th century]]
The Bulgars of Asparuh moved westwards to what is now [[Bessarabia]], subdued the territories to the north of the Danube in modern [[Wallachia]], and established themselves in the [[Danube Delta]].&lt;ref name="fine67"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 670s they crossed the Danube into [[Scythia Minor]], nominally a Byzantine province, whose steppe grasslands and pastures were important for the large herd stocks of the Bulgars in addition to the grazing grounds to the west of the [[Dniester]] River already under their control.&lt;ref name="whittow270"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cambr1995 229"&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 680 the Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine IV]] (r.{{nbsp}}668–685), having recently [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|defeated the Arabs]], led an expedition at the head of a huge army and fleet to drive off the Bulgars but suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of Asparuh [[Battle of Ongal|at Onglos]], a swampy region in or around the Danube Delta where the Bulgars had set a fortified camp.&lt;ref name="fine67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgars advanced south, crossed the [[Balkan Mountains]] and invaded [[Thrace]].&lt;ref name="bg92"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 681, the Byzantines were compelled to sign a humiliating peace treaty, forcing them to acknowledge Bulgaria as an independent state, to cede the territories to the north of the [[Balkan Mountains]] and to pay an annual tribute.&lt;ref name="fine67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Universal history|universal chronicle]] the Western European author [[Sigebert of Gembloux]] remarked that the Bulgarian state was established in 680.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronica by Sigebert of Gembloux" in LIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}III, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/libi/3/gal/3_042.html p. 42]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first state that the empire recognised in the Balkans and the first time it legally surrendered claims to part of its Balkan dominions.&lt;ref name="fine67"/&gt; The Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] wrote of the treaty:

{{quote|...the Emperor [Constantine{{nbsp}}IV] signed peace with them [the Bulgars], and agreed to pay them tribute for shame of the Romans and for our many sins. For it was wondrous for faraway and close peoples to hear that he, who made everyone pay him tribute – to the east and to the west, to the north and to the south, had been defeated by this unclean and newly emerged people.&lt;ref name="bg92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Chronographia by Theophanes the Confessor" in GIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}III, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/3/gal/3_264.html p. 264]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The relations between the Bulgars and the local Slavs is a matter of debate depending on the interpretation of the Byzantine sources.&lt;ref name="bg91"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasil Zlatarski]] asserts that they concluded a treaty&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1970|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; but most historians agree that they were subjugated.&lt;ref name="bg91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=67, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgars were superior organisationally and militarily and came to dominate politically the new state but there was cooperation between them and the Slavs for the protection of the country. The Slavs were allowed to retain their chiefs, to abide to their customs and in return they were to pay tribute in kind and to provide foot soldiers for the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seven Slavic tribes]] were relocated to the west to protect the frontier with the [[Avar Khaganate]], while the [[Severians|Severi]] were resettled in the eastern Balkan Mountains to guard the mountain passes to the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="bg91"/&gt; The number of Asparuh's Bulgars is difficult to estimate. Vasil Zlatarski and [[John Van Antwerp Fine Jr.]] suggest that they were not particularly numerous, numbering some 10,000,&lt;ref name="fine68"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1970|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Steven Runciman]] considers that the tribe must had been of considerable dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1930|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgars settled mainly in the north-east, establishing the capital at [[Pliska]], which was initially a colossal encampment of 23&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; protected with earthen ramparts.&lt;ref name="fine68"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cambr1995 229"/&gt;

To the north-east the war with the Khazars persisted and in 700 Khan Asparuh perished in battle with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1999|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bg106"/&gt; Despite this setback the consolidation of the country continued under Asparuh's successor, Khan [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] (r.{{nbsp}}700–721). In 705 he assisted the deposed Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian II]] to regain his throne in return of the area ''[[Zagore]]'' in [[Northern Thrace]], which was the first expansion of Bulgaria to the south of the Balkan mountains.&lt;ref name="bg106"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1996|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition Tervel obtained the almost imperial title ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''&lt;ref name="cambr1995 231"&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sitting enthroned besides the Emperor received the obeisance of the citizenry of Constantinople and numerous gifts.&lt;ref name="bg106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cambr1995 231"/&gt; However, three years later Justinian tried to regain the ceded territory by force, but his army was defeated [[battle of Anchialus (708)|at Anchialus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1996|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skirmishes continued until 716 when Khan Tervel signed an [[Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 716|important agreement]] with Byzantium that defined the borders and the Byzantine tribute, regulated trade relations and provided for prisoners and fugitives exchange.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 231"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fine75"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Arabs [[Siege of Constantinople (718)|laid siege to Constantinople]] in 717–718 Tervel dispatched his army to help the besieged city. In the decisive battle before the [[Walls of Constantinople]] the Bulgarians slaughtered between 22,000&lt;ref&gt;"Chronographia by Theophanes the Confessor" in GIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}III, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/3/gal/3_269.html p. 269]&lt;/ref&gt; and 30,000&lt;ref&gt;"Chronica by Sigebert of Gembloux" in LIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}III, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/libi/3/gal/3_043.html p. 43]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabs]] forcing them to abandon the undertaking. Most historians agree that Byzantine-Bulgarian victory was the most important one for stopping the Arab offences against [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="fine75"/&gt;

=== Internal instability and struggle for survival ===
[[File:KHM - Nagyszentmiklos Medaillonkrug 2.jpg|250px|alt=A golden jug|thumb|A golden jug from [[Treasure of Nagyszentmiklós|Nagyszentmiklós]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (present Sânnicolau Mare, [[Romania]]) depicting a warrior with his captive. Experts cannot agree if this warrior is Bulgar, Khazar or Avar]]
With the demise of Khan [[Sevar of Bulgaria|Sevar]] (r.{{nbsp}}738–753) the ruling [[Dulo clan]] died out and the Khanate fell into a long political crisis during which the young country was on the verge of destruction. In just fifteen years seven Khans reigned, and all of them were murdered. The only surviving sources of this period are Byzantine and present only the Byzantine point of view of the ensuing political turmoil in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="fine75"/&gt; They describe two factions struggling for power{{snds}}one that sought peaceful relations with the Empire, which was dominant until 755, and one that favoured war.&lt;ref name="fine75"/&gt; These sources present the relations with the Byzantine Empire as the main issue in this internal struggle and do not mention the other reasons, which could have been more important for the Bulgarian elite.&lt;ref name="fine75"/&gt; It is likely that the relationship between the politically dominant Bulgars and the more numerous Slavs was the main issue behind the struggle but there is no evidence about the aims of the rival factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zlatarski speculates that the old Bulgar military aristocracy was leaning towards war while other Bulgars supported by the majority of the Slavs were inclined for peace with Byzantium.&lt;ref name="fine76"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal instability was used by the "soldier Emperor" [[Constantine V]] (r.{{nbsp}}745–775), who launched nine major campaigns aiming to eliminate Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having contained the Arab threat during the first part of his reign, Constantine{{nbsp}}V was able to concentrate his forces on Bulgaria after 755.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 233"&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated the Bulgarians at [[Battle of Marcellae (756)|Marcellae]] in 756, [[Battle of Anchialus (763)|Anchialus]] in 763 and [[Battle of Berzitia|Berzitia]] in 774, but lost the [[battle of the Rishki Pass]] in 759 in addition to hundreds of ships lost to storms in the Black Sea. The Byzantine military successes further deteriorated the crisis in Bulgaria but on the other hand rallied together many different fractions to resist the Byzantine advance in that period of political volatility and military setbacks, as shown at the council of 766 when the nobility and the "armed people" denounced Khan [[Sabin of Bulgaria|Sabin]] with the words ''"Thanks to you, the Romans will enslave Bulgaria!"''.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 233"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 774 Khan [[Telerig of Bulgaria|Telerig]] (r.{{nbsp}}768–777) tricked Constantine{{nbsp}}V into revealing his spies at the Bulgarian court in Pliska and had them all executed.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 233"/&gt; The next year Constantine{{nbsp}}V died during a retaliatory campaign against Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being able to defeat the Bulgarians several times the Byzantines were able neither to conquer Bulgaria, nor to impose their suzerainty and a lasting peace, which is a testimony to the resilience, fighting skills and ideological coherence of the Bulgarian state.&lt;ref name="fine78"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devastation brought to the country by the nine campaigns of Constantine{{nbsp}}V firmly rallied the Slavs behind the Bulgars and greatly increased the dislike of the Byzantines, turning Bulgaria into a hostile neighbour.&lt;ref name="fine78"/&gt; The hostilities continued until 792 when Khan [[Kardam of Bulgaria|Kardam]] (r.{{nbsp}}777–803) achieved an important victory in the [[battle of Marcelae]], forcing the Byzantines once again to pay tribute to the Khans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the victory, the crisis was finally overcome, and Bulgaria entered the new century stable, stronger, and consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of Khan [[Krum]] (r.{{nbsp}}803–814) Bulgaria doubled in size and expanded southward and to the northwest, occupying the lands along the middle Danube and [[Transylvania]]. Between 804 and 806 the Bulgarian armies thoroughly eliminated the Avar Khaganate, which had suffered a crippling blow by the Franks in 796, and a border with the [[Frankish Empire]] was established along the middle [[Danube]] or Tisza.&lt;ref name="fine78"/&gt; Prompted by the Byzantine moves to consolidate their hold on the Slavs in Macedonia and northern Greece and in response to a Byzantine raid against the country, the Bulgarians confronted the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="fine95"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 808 they raided the valley of the [[Struma (river)|Struma]] River, defeating a Byzantine army, and in 809 [[Siege of Serdica (809)|captured]] the important city Serdica (modern [[Sofia]]).&lt;ref name="fine95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cambr1995 235"&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 811 the Byzantine Emperor [[Nicephorus I]] launched a massive offensive against Bulgaria, seized, plundered and burned down the capital Pliska but on the way back the Byzantine army was decisively defeated in the [[battle of Pliska|battle of the Varbitsa Pass]]. Nicephorus{{nbsp}}I himself was slain along with most of his troops, and his skull was lined with silver and used as a drinking cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krum took the initiative and in 812 moved the war towards [[Thrace]], capturing the key Black Sea port of [[Nessebar|Messembria]] and defeating the Byzantines once more [[battle of Versinikia|at Versinikia]] in 813 before proposing a generous peace settlement.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 235"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the negotiations the Byzantines attempted to assassinate Krum. In response, the Bulgarians pillaged Eastern Thrace and seized the important city of [[Edirne|Adrianople]], resettling its 10,000 inhabitants in "[[Bulgarian lands across the Danube|Bulgaria across the Danube]]".&lt;ref name="fine99"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krum made enhanced preparation to capture Constantinople: 5,000 iron-plated wagons were built to carry the siege equipment; the Byzantines even pleaded for help from the Frankish Emperor [[Louis the Pious]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the sudden death of Krum on 14 April 814, however, the campaign was never launched.&lt;ref name="fine99"/&gt; Khan Krum implemented legal reform and issued the first known written law code of Bulgaria that established equal rules for all peoples living within the country's boundaries, intending to reduce poverty and to strengthen the social ties in his vastly enlarged state.&lt;ref name="Bozhilov 1999 140–141"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine100"/&gt;
[[File:Bulgars.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bulgar soldiers slaughter Christians, from the Menologion of Basil II, 10th century.]]
Krum's successor Khan [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]] (r.{{nbsp}}814–831) concluded a [[Treaty of 815|30-year peace treaty]] with the Byzantines, thus allowing both countries to restore their economies and finance after the bloody conflicts in the first decade of the century, establishing the border along the ''[[Erkesia]]'' trench between [[Debelt]]os on the Black Sea and the valley of the [[Maritsa]] River at [[Kalugerovo, Haskovo Province|Kalugerovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cambr1995 236"&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west the Bulgarians were in control of [[Belgrade]] (whose modern name was first known as ''Alba Bulgarica'') by the 820s and the northwestern boundaries with the Frankish Empire were firmly settled along the middle Danube by 827.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine107"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whittow279"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the north-east Omurtag fought the Khazars along the [[Dnieper]] River, which was the easternmost limit of Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et all|1981|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive building was undertaken in the capital Pliska, including the construction of a magnificent palace, pagan temples, ruler's residence, fortress, citadel, water-main, and bath, mainly from stone and brick.&lt;ref name="fine107"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omurtag started in 814 persecution of Christians,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curta|2006|p=XV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular against the Byzantine prisoners of war settled north of the Danube. [[Menologion of Basil II]], glorifies Emperor Basil II as a warrior defending Orthodox Christendom against the attacks of the pagan Bulgars. The expansion to the south and south-west continued under Omurtag's successors under the guidance of the capable ''[[kavhan]]'' (First Minister) [[Isbul]]. During the short reign of Khan [[Malamir of Bulgaria|Malamir]] (r.{{nbsp}}831–836), the important city of Philippopolis ([[Plovdiv]]) was incorporated into the country. Under Khan [[Presian of Bulgaria|Presian]] (r.{{nbsp}}836–852), the Bulgarians took most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], and the borders of the country reached the [[Adriatic Sea]] near [[Vlorë|Valona]] and [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref name="whittow279"/&gt; Byzantine historians do not mention any resistance against the Bulgarian expansion in Macedonia, leading to the conclusion that the expansion was largely peaceful. With this, Bulgaria had become the dominant power in the Balkans.&lt;ref name="whittow279"/&gt; The advances further west was blocked by the development of a new Slavic state under Byzantine patronage, the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Principality of Serbia]].&lt;ref name="whittow279"/&gt; Between 839 and 842 the Bulgarians waged war on the Serbs but did not make any progress. Historian [[Mark Whittow]] asserts that the claim for a Serb victory in that war in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' was a wishful Byzantine thinking&lt;ref name="whittow279"/&gt; but notes that any Serb submission to the Bulgarians went no further than the payment of tribute.&lt;ref name="whittow279"/&gt;
[[File:Bulgaria under Presian-1.jpg|left|250px|alt=A map of the Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century|thumb|Bulgaria after the territorial expansion under Krum, Omurtag and Presian]]
The reign of [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (r.{{nbsp}}852–889) began with numerous setbacks. For ten years the country fought against the Byzantine Empire, [[Eastern Francia]], [[Great Moravia]], the Croats and the Serbs forming several unsuccessful alliances and changing sides.&lt;ref name="fine112"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|pp=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 863 there was a period of 40 days of earthquakes and there was a lean year, which caused famine throughout the country. To cap it all, there was an incursion of locusts. Yet, despite all military setbacks and natural disasters the skilful diplomacy of Boris{{nbsp}}I prevented any territorial losses and kept the realm intact.&lt;ref name="fine112"/&gt; In this complex international situation [[Christianity]] had become attractive as a religion by the mid 9th-century because it provided better opportunities for forging reliable alliances and diplomatic ties.&lt;ref name="whittow280"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking this into account, as well as a variety of internal factors, Boris{{nbsp}}I converted to Christianity in 864, assuming the title ''[[Knyaz]]'' (Prince).&lt;ref name="whittow280"/&gt; Taking advantage of the struggle between the [[Papacy]] in [[Rome]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], Boris{{nbsp}}I brilliantly manoeuvred to assert the independence of the newly established [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Church]].&lt;ref name="whittow283"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; To check the possibility of Byzantine interference in the internal matters of Bulgaria, he sponsored the disciples of the brothers [[Cyril and Methodius]] to create literature in [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian language]].&lt;ref name="fine127"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boris{{nbsp}}I dealt ruthlessly with the opposition to the [[Christianisation of Bulgaria]], crushing a revolt of the nobility in 866 and overthrowing his own son [[Vladimir of Bulgaria|Vladimir]] (r.{{nbsp}}889–893){{Cref2|a}} after he attempted to restore the traditional religion.&lt;ref name="fine119"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 893 he convened the [[Council of Preslav]] where it was decided that the capital of Bulgaria was to be moved from Pliska to [[Veliki Preslav|Preslav]], the Byzantine clergy was to be banished from the country and replaced with Bulgarian clerics, and Old Bulgarian language was to replace the Greek in liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria was to become the principle threat for the stability and security of the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stephenson|2004|p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decisions of the Council of Preslav brought an end to the Byzantine hopes to exert influence over the newly Christianized country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bakalov et al|2003|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 894 the Byzantines moved the Bulgarian market from Constantinople to [[Thessaloniki]], affecting the commercial interests of Bulgaria and the principle of Byzantine–Bulgarian trade, regulated under the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 716|Treaty of 716]] and later agreements on the [[most favoured nation]] basis.&lt;ref name="fine137"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1930|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Prince, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]] (r.{{nbsp}}893–927), who came to be known as Simeon the Great, [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896|declared war]] and defeated the Byzantine army in Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=286–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines turned for aid to the [[Magyars]], who at the time inhabited the steppes to the north-east of Bulgaria. The Magyars scored two victories over the Bulgarians and pillaged [[Dobruja|Dobrudzha]] but Simeon{{nbsp}}I allied with the [[Pechenegs]] further east and in 895 the Bulgarian army inflicted a [[Battle of Southern Buh|crushing defeat on the Magyars]] in the steppes along the [[Southern Bug]] River. At the same time, the Pechenegs advanced westwards and prevented the Magyars from returning to their homeland.&lt;ref name="fine139"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blow was so heavy that the Magyars were forced to migrate west, eventually settling in the [[Pannonian Basin]], where they eventually established the [[Kingdom of Hungary (medieval)|Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine139"/&gt; In 896 the Byzantines were routed in the decisive [[battle of Boulgarophygon]] and pleaded for peace that confirmed the Bulgarian domination on the Balkans,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; restored the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation, abolished the commercial restrictions and obliged the Byzantine Empire to pay annual tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|pp=318–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peace treaty remained in force until 912 although Simeon{{nbsp}}I did violate it following the [[Sack of Thessalonica (904)|sack of Thessaloniki]] in 904, extracting further territorial concessions in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 913 the Byzantine emperor [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]] provoked a [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 913–927|bitter war]] after resolving to discontinue paying an annual tribute to Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the military and ideological initiative was held by Simeon{{nbsp}}I, who was seeking ''[[casus belli]]'' to fulfil his ambition to be recognized as Emperor (in Bulgarian, ''[[Tsar]]'') and to conquer Constantinople, creating a joint Bulgarian–Roman state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 917, the Bulgarian army dealt a crushing defeat to the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Achelous (917)|battle of Achelous]], resulting in Bulgaria's total military supremacy in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Theophanes Continuatus]] "a bloodshed occurred, that had not happened in centuries",&lt;ref&gt;"Chronographia by Theophanes Continuatus" in GIBI, vol.

The Bulgarians also captured the important city of Adrianople in Thrace and seized the capital of the [[Hellas (theme)|Theme of Hellas]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], deep in southern Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1999|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disaster at Achelous, the [[Byzantine diplomacy]] incited the Principality of Serbia to [[Bulgarian–Serbian wars of 917–924|attack]] Bulgaria from the west, but this assault was easily contained. In 924, the Serbs ambushed and defeated a small Bulgarian army,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; provoking a major retaliatory campaign that ended with Bulgaria's annexation of Serbia at the end of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stephenson|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further expansion in the Western Balkans was checked by King [[Tomislav of Croatia]], who was a Byzantine ally and [[Croatian–Bulgarian battle of 926|defeated]] a Bulgarian invasion in 926.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simeon{{nbsp}}I was aware that he needed naval support to conquer Constantinople and in 922 sent envoys to the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah]] in [[Mahdia]] to negotiate the assistance of the powerful [[Arabs|Arab]] navy. The caliph sent representatives to Bulgaria to arrange an alliance but his emissaries were captured en route by the Byzantines near the [[Calabria]]n coast. The Byzantine Emperor [[Romanos I Lekapenos]] managed to avert a Bulgarian–Arab alliance by showering the Arabs with generous gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=152–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war dragged on until Simeon I's death in May 927. By then Bulgaria controlled almost all Byzantine possessions in the Balkans, but without a fleet did not attempt to storm Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both countries were exhausted by the huge military efforts that had taken a heavy toll on the population and economy. Simeon's successor [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]] (r.{{nbsp}}927–969) negotiated a favourable [[Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 927|peace treaty]]. The Byzantines agreed to recognize him as Emperor of Bulgaria and the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] as an independent Patriarchate, as well as to pay an annual tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine161"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peace was reinforced with a marriage between Peter and Romanos's granddaughter [[Irene Lekapene]].&lt;ref name="fine161"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement ushered in a period of 40 years of peaceful relations between the two powers. During the first years of his reign, Peter I faced revolts by two of his three brothers, John in 928 and [[Mihail of Bulgaria|Michael]] in 930, but both were quelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; During most of his subsequent rule until 965, Peter{{nbsp}}I presided over a [[Golden Age]] of the Bulgarian state in a period of political consolidation, economic expansion and cultural activity.&lt;ref name="stephenson25"&gt;{{harvnb|Stephenson|2004|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:First Bulgarian Empire (976-1018).png|left|250px|alt=A map of the Bulgarian Empire in the late 10th and early 11th centuries|thumb|Bulgaria under the rule of Emperor [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuel]]]]
Despite the treaty and the largely peaceful era that followed, the strategic position of the Bulgarian Empire remained difficult. The country was surrounded by aggressive neighbours{{snds}}the Magyars to the north-west, the Pechenegs and the growing power of [[Kievan Rus']] to the north-east, and the Byzantine Empire to the south, which proved to be an unreliable neighbour.&lt;ref name="whittow293"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria suffered several devastating Magyar raids between 934 and 965. The growing insecurity, as well as expanding influence of the landed nobility and the higher clergy at the expense of the personal privileges of the peasantry, led to the emergence of [[Bogomilism]], a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] heretic [[sect]] that in the subsequent decades and centuries spread to the Byzantine Empire, northern Italy and southern France (cf. [[Cathars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the south, the Byzantine Empire reversed the course of the [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|Byzantine–Arab wars]] against the declining [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and in 965 discontinued the payment of the tribute, leading to sharp deterioration of the bilateral relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 968 the Byzantines incited Kievan Rus' to [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|invade Bulgaria]]. In two years the Kievan Prince [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatoslav I]] [[Battle of Silistra|defeated]] the Bulgarian army, captured Preslav and established his capital at the important Bulgarian city of [[Pereyaslavets|Preslavets]] (meaning "Little Preslav").&lt;ref name="fine182"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this desperate situation the ageing Peter{{nbsp}}I abdicated, leaving the crown to his son [[Boris II of Bulgaria|Boris II]] (r.{{nbsp}}969–971), who had little choice but to cooperate with Svyatoslav.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unexpected success of the Rus' campaigns led to a confrontation with the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="fine182"/&gt; The Byzantine Emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]] eventually defeated Svyatoslav's forces and compelled him to leave the Balkans in 971.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=295–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of their campaign the Byzantines seized Preslav and detained Boris{{nbsp}}II. Initially John{{nbsp}}I Tzimiskes presented himself as a liberator but Boris{{nbsp}}II was promptly forced to ritually abdicate in Constantinople.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although at the time the Byzantines controlled only the eastern regions of the country, Bulgaria was proclaimed a Byzantine province.&lt;ref name="fine187"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lands to the west of the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar River]] remained free and the Bulgarians were able to regroup headed by the four [[Cometopuli dynasty|Cometopuli]] brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=296–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 976, the youngest of them, [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuel]], concentrated all power in his hands following the death of his eldest siblings. When in 976 the rightful heir to the throne, Boris{{nbsp}}II's brother [[Roman of Bulgaria|Roman]] (r.{{nbsp}}971–997), escaped from captivity in Constantinople, he was recognized as Emperor by Samuel,&lt;ref name="whittow297"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Cref2|b}} who remained the chief commander of the Bulgarian army. Peace was impossible because as a result of the symbolic ending of the Bulgarian Empire following Boris{{nbsp}}II's abdication, Roman and later Samuel, were seen as rebels and the Byzantine Emperor was bound to enforce the imperial sovereignty over them.&lt;ref name="whittow297"/&gt; This led to more than [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria|40 years]] of increasingly bitter warfare.&lt;ref name="whittow297"/&gt; A capable general and good politician, at first Samuel managed to turn the fortunes to the Bulgarians. The new Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] was decisively defeated in the [[Battle of the Gates of Trajan]] in 986 and barely escaped with his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine poet [[John Geometres]] wrote of the defeat:

Immediately after the victory Samuel pushed east and recovered north-eastern Bulgaria with the old capitals Pliska and Preslav. In the next ten years the Bulgarian armies expanded the country south annexing the whole of [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus]] and plundering the [[Peloponnese]] Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the major Bulgarian military successes and the defection of a number of Byzantine officials to the Bulgarians, the prospect of the Byzantines losing all their Balkan themes was quite real.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threatened by an alliance between the Byzantines and the Serbian state of [[Duklja]], in 997 Samuel defeated and captured its Prince [[Jovan Vladimir]] and took control of the Serb lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 997, following the death of Roman, the last heir of the [[Krum's dynasty]], Samuel was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria. He established friendly relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]] through a marriage between his son and heir [[Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria|Gavril Radomir]] and Stephen's daughter but eventually Gavril Radomir expelled his wife and in 1004 Hungary participated with the Byzantine forces against Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=195–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1000 the tides of the war turned in favor of the Byzantines under the personal leadership of Basil{{nbsp}}II, who launched annual campaigns of methodical conquest of the Bulgarian cities and strongholds that were sometimes carried out in all twelve months of the year instead of the usual short campaigning of the epoch with the troops returning home to winter.&lt;ref name="fine197"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1001 they seized Pliska and Preslav in the east, in 1003 a major offensive along the Danube resulted in the fall of Vidin after an eight-month siege, and in 1004 Basil{{nbsp}}II defeated Samuel in the [[battle of Skopje]] and took possession of the city.&lt;ref name="fine197"/&gt; The war attrition dragged on for a decade until 1014, when the Bulgarians were decisively defeated [[Battle of Kleidion|at Kleidion]].

== Government ==
[[File:Omurtag1.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=A medieval monarch|Khan [[Omurtag of Bulgaria|Omurtag]] was the first Bulgarian ruler known to have claimed divine origin, ''[[Madrid Skylitzes]]'']]
The First Bulgarian Empire was a hereditary monarchy. The monarch was responsible for the issues of peace and war. He was the commander-in-chief of the [[Medieval Bulgarian army|armed forces]], a judge and a high priest in the pagan period.&lt;ref name="angelov170"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="koledarov11"&gt;{{harvnb|Koledarov|1979|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He guided the external policy of the country and could conclude treaties personally or through authorised emissaries.&lt;ref name="koledarov11"/&gt; In the pagan period the title of the ruler was [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. After 864 Boris I adopted the Slavic [[Knyaz]] (Prince), and since 913 the Bulgarian monarchs were recognised as [[Tsar]]s (Emperors).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=145–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authority of the Khan was limited by the leading noble families and the People's Council. The People's Council included the nobility and the "armed people" was gathered to discuss issues of crucial importance for the state. A People's Council in 766 dethroned Khan [[Sabin of Bulgaria|Sabin]] because he was seeking peace with the Byzantines.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 233"/&gt; According to the old Bulgarian tradition the Khan was first among equals and that was among the reasons for why Boris I decided to convert to Christianity, as the Christian monarch ruled by the grace of God.&lt;ref name="fine119"/&gt; However, it should be noted that the divinity of the Bulgarian ruler, as well as his superiority over the Byzantine Emperor, were already asserted by Khan Omurtag (r.{{nbsp}}814–831),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in the [[Chatalar Inscription]]:

{{quote|The [[Kanasubigi]] Omurtag is a divine ruler in the land where he was born. ... May God [ [[Tengri|Tangra]] ] grant that the divine ruler may press down the [Byzantine] emperor with his foot so long as the [[Kamchiya|Ticha]] flows...&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The second most important post in Bulgaria after the monarch was the ''[[kavhan]]'', monopolised by the members of the tentatively known "Kavhan family".&lt;ref name="andreev175"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lazarov|Pavlov|1999|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''kavhan'' had broad powers and commanded the left wing of the army, and at times the whole army.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could be a co-ruler or a regent during the minority of the monarch;&lt;ref name="angelov175"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sources mention that Khan Malamir "ruled together with ''kavhan'' [[Isbul]]" (fl. 820s–830s)&lt;ref name="andreev175"/&gt; and ''kavhan'' Dometian is noted as an associate [in the government] of Gavril Radomir (r. 1014–1015).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third highest-ranking official was the ''[[ichirgu-boil]]a'', who commanded the right wing of the army at war and might have had the role of a foreign minister.&lt;ref name="angelov175"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his direct command were 1,300 soldiers.&lt;ref name="angelov175"/&gt; Historian [[Veselin Beshevliev]] assumes that the post might have been created under the reign of Khan Krum (r. 803–814), or earlier, in order to limit the power of the ''kavhan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially the Bulgarians did not have their own writing system, the presence of numerous stone inscriptions, mainly in Greek language, indicate the existence of a chancellery to the Khan that was probably organised in Byzantine manner.&lt;ref name="beshevliev99"&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bozhilov156"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the chancellery's staff might have been Greeks and even monks, despite the fact that the country was still pagan.&lt;ref name="beshevliev99"/&gt;

=== Social classes ===
[[File:Simbol of dulo.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A symbol|The symbol ıYı is associated with the [[Dulo clan]] and the First Empire]]
According to an inscription dated from the reign of Khan Malamir (r.{{nbsp}}831–836) there were three classes in pagan Bulgaria{{snds}}''boilas'', ''bagains'' and ''Bulgarians'', i.e. the common people.&lt;ref name="beshevliev66"&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobility were initially known as the ''[[boila]]'' but after the 10th century the word was transformed to ''[[boyar|bolyar]]'', which was eventually adopted in many countries in [[Eastern Europe]]. Each ''boila'' clan had its own totem and was believed to had been divinely established, hence their staunch opposition to Christianity, which was seen as a threat to their privileges.&lt;ref name="fine108"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the clans had ancient origin that could be traced back to the time when the Bulgars inhabited the steppes to the north and east of the Black Sea.&lt;ref name="angelov170"/&gt; The ''[[Nominalia of the Bulgarian khans]]'' mentions monarchs of three clans that ruled Bulgaria until 766{{snds}}Dulo, Vokil and Ugain.&lt;ref name="angelov170"/&gt; The power of the principal noble families was greatly crippled in the aftermath of the anti-Christian rebellion of 866, when Boris{{nbsp}}I executed 52 leading ''boilas'' along with their families.&lt;ref name="fine120"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''boila'' were divided into inner and outer boilas and it was among their ranks that the holders of the highest military and administrative posts were selected.&lt;ref name="beshevliev66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov172"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most likely the ''outer boilas'' resided outside the capital, while the inner ones were member of the court under the direct influence of the monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''bagains'' were the second-ranking aristocratic class and were divided into numerous ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|pp=66–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of two separate nobility classes is further confirmed in the ''Responsa Nicolai ad consulta Bulgarorum'' (Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgarians), where Boris{{nbsp}}I wrote about ''primates'' and ''mediocres seu minores''.&lt;ref name="angelov172"/&gt; Another privileged group were the ''[[tarkhan]]s'', although from the surviving inscriptions it is impossible to determine whether they belonged to the ''boilas'' or to the ''bagains'', or were a separate class.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Bulgar titles and many of the institutions from the pagan era were preserved after the Christianisation of Bulgaria until the very fall of the First Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Biliarsky|2011|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the 9th century was marked with a process of incorporation of both Slavs and Byzantine Greeks in the ranks of the Bulgarian nobility and privileged classes, which increased the power of the monarch that had been previously curtailed by the leading Bulgar aristocratic families.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time certain Slavic titles became more prominent, such as ''[[župan]]'', and some of them mingled forming titles like ''župan tarkhan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The peasants lived in rural communities known as ''[[zadruga]]'' and had collective responsibility.&lt;ref name="angelov167"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the peasantry were personally free under the direct rule of the central administration and the legislation introduced following the adoption of Christianity regulated their relations.&lt;ref name="angelov167"/&gt; The number of personally dependent peasants bound to nobility or ecclesiastical estates increased since the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=356–357, 365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administration ===
Due to the limited remaining sources it is very difficult to reconstruct the administrative evolution and division of the country. Initially the Slavic tribes retained their autonomy but since the beginning of the 9th century commenced a process of centralisation.&lt;ref name="bozhilov156"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Bulgaria's territory steadily expanded the measures against the tribal autonomy were deemed necessary in order to achieve more effective control and to prevent separatism.&lt;ref name="angelov153"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in the 820s some Slavic tribes in western Bulgaria, the Timochani, Branichevtsi and Abodriti sought overlordship from the Franks, Khan Omurtag replaced their chieftains with his own governors.&lt;ref name="angelov153"/&gt; The country was divided into ''[[County|comitati]]'', governed by a ''comita'', although this term was used by Western European chroniclers, who wrote in Latin. It is likely that the Bulgarians used the term ''земя'' (''zemya'', meaning "land"), as mentioned in the Court Law for the People.&lt;ref name="angelov247"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|1971|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their number is unknown, but the Archbishop of Reims [[Hincmar]] mentioned that the 866 rebellion against Boris I was headed by the nobility of the 10 ''comitati''.&lt;ref name="angelov247"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were further divided into ''[[župa|župi]]'', that in turn consisted of ''zadrugi''. The ''comita'' was appointed by the monarch, and was assisted by a ''tarkhan''. The former had many civil and administrative functions, while the latter was responsible for the military affairs.&lt;ref name="angelov248"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|1971|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few ''comitati'' known by name was [[Kutmichevitsa]] in south-western Bulgaria, corresponding to modern western Macedonia, southern Albania and north-western Greece.&lt;ref name="angelov248"/&gt;

=== Legislation ===
The first know written Bulgarian [[Code of law|law code]] was issued by Khan Krum at a People's Council in the very beginning of the 9th century but the text has not survived in its integrity and only certain items have been preserved in the 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia ''[[Suda]]''.&lt;ref name="fine100"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; It prescribed death penalty for false oaths and false accusations and severe penalties for thieves and those who gave them shelter.&lt;ref name="fine100"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov145"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bozhilov 1999 140–141"/&gt; The ''Suda'' also mentioned that the laws foresaw the uprooting of all vineyards as a measure against drunkenness but this claim is refuted in the contemporary sources that indicate that after capturing Pliska in 811 the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus{{nbsp}}I found large quantities of wine; and after the final Bulgarian victory Krum drank wine in the Emperor's skull.&lt;ref name="angelov145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krum's legal code is seen by many historians as an attempt to centralise the state and to end the different element of the society by putting them under a single set of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the text is not preserved its precise aims remain unknown.&lt;ref name="fine100"/&gt;

After the conversion to Christianity Boris{{nbsp}}I was concerned with the legal matters and asked [[Pope Nicholas I]] to provide legal texts.&lt;ref name="fine129"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, under his reign was compiled the ''Законъ соудный людьмъ'' (''Zakon sudnyi ljud'm''), or the Court Law for the People, based heavily on the Byzantine [[Byzantine law|Ecloga]] and Nomocanon, but adapted to the Bulgarian conditions and valid for the whole population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov|1971|pp=269–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine129"/&gt; It combined element of civil, criminal, canon and military law, as well as public and private law, and included substantive norms and procedural guidelines. The Court Law for the People dealt with combating paganism, testimony of witnesses, sexual morality, marital relations, distribution of war booty, etc.&lt;ref name="fine129"/&gt; To eradicate the residual paganism the law provided that a village that allowed performance of pagan rituals should be transferred along its whole land to the Church; and should a rich landowner perform them, his lands were to be sold, and the revenue shared among the poor.&lt;ref name="angelov167"/&gt;

== Military ==
{{main|Medieval Bulgarian army}}
[[File:Sword of Varbitza, Replica Ratina.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=A replica of a sabre|A replica of a Bulgarian sabre found near the town of [[Varbitsa (town)|Varbitsa]]]]
After the formation of the Bulgarian state the ruling elite harboured deep distrust towards the Byzantines against whose perfidy and sudden attacks they had to maintain constant vigilance.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 229"/&gt; The Byzantine Empire never relinquished its claim over all lands to the south of the Danube and made several attempts to enforce that claim. Throughout the existence of the First Empire Bulgaria could expect Byzantine onslaughts aimed at its destruction.&lt;ref name="whittow280"/&gt; The steppes to the north-east were home to numerous peoples whose unpredictable pillaging raids were also of concern.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 237"&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, military preparedness was a top priority.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 237"/&gt; All borders of the country were under vigilance. Guards always stood on the alert and if anyone was to flee during a watch, the responsible guards are killed without hesitation.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 237"/&gt; Before battle, a "most faithful and prudent man" was sent to inspect all the arms, horses, and materiel and being ill-prepared or readied in a useless fashion was punishable by death.&lt;ref name="cambr1995 237"/&gt; Capital punishment was also prescribed for riding [[Horses in warfare|war horses]] in peace time.&lt;ref name="angelov341"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulgarian army was armed with various types of weapons, the most widely used being [[sabre]]s, [[sword]]s, [[battle axe]]s, [[spear]]s, [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[lasso|arkans]], [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]].&lt;ref name="angelov80"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soldiers were often trained to use both spears and bows.&lt;ref name="angelov80"/&gt; The Bulgarians wore helms, mails and shields for defence. The helms were usually cone-shaped, the shields were round and light. The mails were two types{{snds}}[[Mail (armour)|wedge riveted mails]] consisting of small metal rings linked together, and [[scale armour]] consisting of small armour plates attached to each other.&lt;ref name="angelov80"/&gt; Belts were very important for the early Bulgarians and were often decorated with golden, silver, bronze or copper buckles that manifested the illustrious origin of the holder.&lt;ref name="angelov80"/&gt;

The most important part of the army was the [[heavy cavalry]]. In the early 9th century the Bulgarian Khan could muster 30,000 riders "all covered in iron"&lt;ref name="si23"&gt;"Scrptor incertus" in GIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}IV, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/4/gal/4_023.html p. 23]&lt;/ref&gt; who were armoured with iron helms and chain-mails.&lt;ref name="bozhilov137"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The horses too were covered with armour.&lt;ref name="angelov144"/&gt; As the capital Pliska was situated in an open plain the cavalry was essential for its protection.&lt;ref name="koledarov13"&gt;{{harvnb|Koledarov|1979|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fortification system of the inner regions of the country was reinforced with several fortified trenches covering huge spaces and supporting the manoeuvrability of the cavalry.&lt;ref name="koledarov13"/&gt;
[[File:Bulgarians defeat Byzantines under Krenites and Kourtikios.jpg|250px|left|thumb|alt=A medieval manuscript|A battle scene of the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896]], ''Madrid Skylitzes'']]
The army was well versed in the use of [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]]s. A strong cavalry unit was often held in reserve and would attack the enemy at an opportune moment. Free horses would be sometimes concentrated behind the battle formation to avoid surprise attacks from the rear.&lt;ref name="angelov81"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian army used ambushes and feigned retreats, during which the cavalrymen rode with their backs to the horse, firing clouds of arrows on the enemy. If the enemy pursued disorganized, they would turn back and fiercely attack them.&lt;ref name="angelov81"/&gt; The Bulgarians were able to fight at night{{snds}}in 917 they defeated the Byzantine in the [[battle of Katasyrtai]] after a nocturnal combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=288–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The army employed ''[[ruse de guerre]]''. In 918 the Bulgarians took the capital of the Byzantine theme [[Hellas (theme)|Hellas]] [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] without bloodshed after sending into the city five men with axes who eliminated the guards, broke the hinges of the gates, and opened them to the main forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1999|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Strategikon by Kekaumenos" in GIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}VII, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/7/gal/7_020.html p. 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulgarian army was well equipped with [[siege engine]]s. The Bulgarians employed the services of Byzantine and Arab captives and fugitives to produce siege equipment, such as the engineer Eumathius, who sought refuge to Khan Krum after the capture of Serdica in 809.&lt;ref name="angelov144"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 9th century anonymous Byzantine chronicler known as ''Scrptor incertus'' lists the contemporary machinery produced and used by the Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;"Scrptor incertus" in GIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}IV, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/4/gal/4_023.html pp. 23]–[http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/4/gal/4_024.html 24]&lt;/ref&gt; These included [[catapult]]s; [[Scorpio (weapon)|scorpions]]; multi-storey [[siege tower]]s with a [[battering ram]] on the bottom floor; ''testudos''{{snds}}battering rams with metal plating on the top; ''τρίβόλοι''{{snds}}iron tridents placed hidden amidst the battlefield to hinder the enemy cavalry; ladders, etc.&lt;ref name="angelov144"/&gt; Iron-plated wagons were used for transportation. It is known that Khan Krum prepared 5,000 such wagons for his intended siege of Constantinople in 814.&lt;ref name="angelov144"/&gt; Wooden [[pontoon bridge]]s were also constructed for crossing rivers.&lt;ref name="si23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bozhilov137"/&gt;

== Economy and urbanism ==
Agriculture was the most important sector of the economy whose development was favoured by the fertile soils of Moesia, Thrace, and partly, Macedonia.&lt;ref name="angelov339"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land was divided into "lord's lands" and "village lands".&lt;ref name="angelov167"/&gt; The most widespread cereals were [[wheat]], [[rye]] and [[millet]] that were the staple food for the populace.&lt;ref name="angelov339"/&gt; Other crops of significance were [[grape]]s, [[orchard]]s, especially after the 9th century, and [[linen]]. The latter was used for fabrics and cloths that were exported to the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref name="angelov339"/&gt; Due to natural calamities, such as droughts or [[locust]]s, harvests were not secure and there were occasional hunger years. In response to this problem the state maintained depositories of cereals as a reserve.&lt;ref name="angelov340"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal husbandry]] was well developed, the main stocks being [[cattle]], [[ox]]en, [[Water buffalo|buffalo]]s, [[sheep]], [[pig]]s and [[horse]]s.&lt;ref name="angelov340"/&gt; Animal stocks were vital for farming, transport, military, clothing and food. The importance of the meat for the Bulgarian table was demonstrated in the ''Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgarians'', where seven out of 115 questions concerned meat consumption.&lt;ref name="angelov340"/&gt;

Small-scale mining was developed in the Balkan Mountains, the [[Rhodope Mountains]] and some regions of Macedonia.&lt;ref name="angelov340"/&gt; A number of diverse handicrafts thrived in the urban centres and some villages. Preslav had workshops that processed metals (especially gold and silver), stone and wood, and produced ceramics, glass and jewellery.&lt;ref name="angelov304"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine133"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarians produced tiles with higher qualities than the Byzantines and exported them to the Byzantine Empire and Kievan Rus'.&lt;ref name="fine133"/&gt; There was large-scale production of bricks in eastern Bulgaria, many of them marked with the symbol "IYI", which is associated with the Bulgarian state, indicating possible state-organised production facilities.&lt;ref name="angelov304"/&gt; Since the destruction of the Avar Khaganete in the beginning of the 9th century Bulgaria controlled the [[Salt mining|salt mines]] in Transylvania until they were overran by the Magyars a century earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koledarov|1979|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the salt trade was illustrated during the negotiations for alliance between Bulgaria and East Francia in 892 when the Frankish King [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]] demanded that Bulgaria discontinue the export of salt to Great Moravia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Médaillon byzantin - Varna.jpg|250px|thumb|alt=A medieval treasure|A pendant of the [[Preslav treasure]]]]
Trade had an important weight in the economy, as Bulgaria lay between the Byzantine Empire, Central Europe, the Rus' and the steppes.&lt;ref name="fine169"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trade relations with the Byzantine Empire was regulated on a [[most favoured nation]] basis by treaties that included commercial clauses.&lt;ref name="fine137"/&gt; The first such treaty was signed in 716 and determined that goods could only be imported or exported when provided with a state seal. Goods without documents were to be confiscated for the state treasury. The Bulgarian merchants had a colony in Constantinople and paid favourable taxes.&lt;ref name="fine137"/&gt; The relevance of international trade for Bulgaria was evident, as the country was willing to go to [[Byzantine–Bulgarian war of 894–896|war]] with the Byzantine Empire when in 894 the latter moved the market of the Bulgarian traders from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where they had to pay larger taxes and did not have direct access to goods from the east.&lt;ref name="fine137"/&gt; In 896 the war was won and the status of Bulgaria as a most favoured nation restored and commercial restrictions – abolished.&lt;ref name="fine139"/&gt; Some Bulgarian towns acquired great prosperity, such as [[Pereyaslavets|Preslavets]] on the Danube that was described in the 960s as being more prosperous that the capital of the Rus', [[Kiev]].&lt;ref name="fine169"/&gt; A contemporary chronicle lists the main trade partners and chief imports to Bulgaria. The country imported gold, silks, wine and fruits from the Byzantine Empire, silver and horses from Hungary and Bohemia, furs, honey, wax and slaves from the Rus'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were commercial ties with Italy and the [[Middle East]] as well.&lt;ref name="angelov298"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Bulgarian Empire did not mint coins and taxes were paid in kind.&lt;ref name="Angelov et al 1981 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine170"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known whether they were based on land or on person, or both. In addition to the taxes the peasantry must have had other obligations, such as building and maintaining infrastructure and defences, as well as to provide food and inventory to the army.&lt;ref name="fine170"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab writer [[Al-Masudi]] noted that instead of money the Bulgarians used cows and sheep to buy goods.&lt;ref name="Angelov et al 1981 345"/&gt;

The density of the network of towns was high. The economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] estimated that in 800 Pliska had 30,000 inhabitants and around 950 Preslav had some 60,000 making it the largest city in non-Muslim Europe, save Constantinople.&lt;ref name="bairoch"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bairoch|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Bairoch|url=https://books.google.bg/books/about/Cities_and_Economic_Development.html?id=Cg7JYZO_nEMC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Cities and Economic Development|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1988|isbn=978-0226034669|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the largest cities in contemporary France and Italy did not reach 30,000 and 50,000 respectively.&lt;ref name="bairoch"/&gt; Alongside the two capitals existed other prominent urban centres that made Bulgaria the most urbanised region in Christian Europe at the time along with Italy.&lt;ref name="bairoch"/&gt; According to contemporary chronicles there were 80 towns only in the region of the lower Danube.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving sources list more than 100 settlements in the western areas of the Empire where the Bulgarian Orthodox Church possessed properties.&lt;ref name="angelov357"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger urban centres consisted of an inner and an outer town. The inner town would be encircled with stone walls and had administrative and defence functions, while the outer town, usually unprotected, was the centre of economic activities with markets, workshops, vineyards, gardens and dwellings for the populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that as elsewhere in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the country remained predominantly rural.

== Religion ==
=== Pagan Bulgaria ===
[[File:Rosette from Pliska.svg|250px|thumb|alt=A rosette|The [[Pliska rosette]] dated from the pagan period has seven fingers representing the [[Classical planet]]s]]
In the first almost two centuries after its creation, the Bulgarian state remained pagan. The Bulgars and the Slavs continued to practice their indigenous religions. The Bulgar religion was monotheistic, linked to the cult to [[Tengri|Tangra]], the God of the Sky.&lt;ref name="angelov193"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whittow282"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worship of Tangra is proven by an inscription that reads "Kanasubigi Omurtag, a divine ruler ... performed sacrifice to God Tangra".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beshevliev|1992|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling Khan had an important place in the religious life; he was the high priest and performed rituals.&lt;ref name="angelov170"/&gt; A large sanctuary dedicated to the cult of Tangra existed near the modern village of [[Madara (village)|Madara]].&lt;ref name="angelov193"/&gt; The Bulgars practised [[shamanism]], believed in magic and charms, and performed various rituals.&lt;ref name="angelov193"/&gt; Some of the rituals were described by the Byzantines after the "most Christian" ruler [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] had to pour out water on the ground from a cup, to personally turn round horse saddles, to touch triple bridle, to lift grass high above the ground and to cut up dogs as witnesses during the ceremony of the signing of the [[Byzantine–Bulgarian Treaty of 815]].&lt;ref name="andreev58"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pouring of water was a reminder that if the oath is broken, blood would pour out. In the same sense can be explained the turning of the saddle{{snds}}a warning that the violator would not be able to ride or would fall dead from his horse during battle. The triple bridle symbolised the toughness of the agreement and the lifting of grass reminded that no grass would remain in the enemy country if the peace was broken. The sacrifice of dogs was a common custom among the Turkic peoples which further strengthened the treaty.&lt;ref name="andreev58"/&gt;

The Slavs worshiped numerous deities. The supreme god was [[Perun]], the god of thunder and lightning.&lt;ref name="andreev54"&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perun was the only god mentioned (though not by name) by the first authoritative reference to the [[Slavic mythology]] in written history, the 6th-century Byzantine historian [[Procopius]], who described the Slavs that settled south of the Danube. Procopius noted that they also worshipped rivers and believed in [[nymph]]s.&lt;ref name="andreev54"/&gt; A number of mythological beings from the Slavic pantheon have persisted in Bulgarian folklore to the present, such as [[Samodiva (mythology)|samodiva]]s, [[Ala (demon)|hala]]s, [[Supernatural beings in Slavic folklore|vilas]], [[rusalka]]s, [[slavic dragon]]s, etc. During sacrifices the Slavs would perform [[divination]]s. After the adoption of Christianity the worship of Perun merged with the cult of Saint [[Elijah]].&lt;ref name="andreev54"/&gt;
[[File:Bulgars.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=a page of a medieval manuscript|Bulgarian soldiers kill Christians during the persecutions, ''[[Menologion of Basil II]]'']]
Christianity was practised in Bulgaria throughout the whole pagan period. Its dissemination among the populace increased as a result of the successful wars of Khan Krum in the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krum employed many Byzantine Christians{{snds}}Greeks, Armenians and Slavs{{snds}}in his military and administration; some of them served as deputies of the ''kavhan'' and the ''ichirgu-boila''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tens of thousands Byzantines were resettled across Bulgaria, mainly beyond the Danube River to protect the north-eastern borders, so that they could face non-Byzantines.&lt;ref name="fine105"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them, however, maintained clandestine links with the Byzantine court which fuelled the traditional distrust of the Bulgarian elite and resulted in a large-scale persecution of Christianity under the Khans Omurtag and Malamir. Omurtag and the nobility saw the Christians as Byzantine agents and felt that this religion, with its hierarchy based in Byzantium, was a threat to Bulgarian independence.&lt;ref name="fine108"/&gt; There were some executions, including two of the five ''strategoi'' who served under Krum, Leo and John, the metropolitan of Adrianople, the bishop of Debeltos, etc.&lt;ref name="fine108"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bozhilov147"&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of the martyred Christians included Bulgar (Asfer, Kuberg) and Slav names.&lt;ref name="bozhilov147"/&gt; The dismissive attitude of the Christians towards the pagans was insulting to the Bulgarian elite. In a conversation with a Byzantine Christian Omurtag told him: "Do not humiliate our gods, for their power is great. As a proof, we who worship them, have conquered the whole Roman state".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, despite all measures, Christianity continued to spread,&lt;ref name="fine108"/&gt; reaching the members of the Khan's own family. Omurtag's eldest son [[Enravota]], seen as pro-Christian, was disinherited and eventually converted to Christianity. After refusing to renounce his faith, he was executed by orders of his brother Malamir c. 833 and became the first Bulgarian saint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|pp=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of the Bulgarian rulers to Christianity is seen in the [[Presian Inscription|Philippi Inscription]] of Khan Presian:

{{quote|...If someone seeks the truth, God watches. And if one lies, God watches. The Bulgarians did many good things to the Christians [the Byzantines] and the Christians forgot, but God watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozhilov|Gyuzelev|1999|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Christianization ===
{{main|Christianization of Bulgaria}}
By 863 Presian's successor Khan Boris{{nbsp}}I had decided to accept Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sources do not mention the reasons behind this decision but there were several political rationales that he had considered. As Christianity was spreading further into Europe in the 9th century the pagan countries found themselves encircled by Christian powers which could use religion as an acceptable excuse for aggression.&lt;ref name="whittow280"/&gt; Conversion on the other hand would establish the country as an equal international partner.&lt;ref name="whittow280"/&gt; There is evidence that Bulgaria did have contacts with the Muslim world as well{{snds}}either directly or through [[Volga Bulgaria]] that had adopted [[Islam]] at about the same time{{snds}}but the country was far away from any Muslim country that could be of any political benefit, and large part of the population had already been Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|pp=280–281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Christian doctrine would cement the monarch's position high above the nobility as an [[Autocracy|autocrat]], being ruler "by the grace of God" and God's representative on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine118"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Christianity presented excellent opportunity to firmly consolidate both Bulgars and Slavs in a single Bulgarian people under common religion.&lt;ref name="fine118"/&gt;
[[File:Baptism of the Preslav Court.jpg|250px|alt=A painting depicting baptism|thumb|Baptism of Boris I and his court, ''painting by Nikolai Pavlovich'']]
In 863 Boris{{nbsp}}I sought a mission from [[East Francia]] rather than from the Byzantine Empire. He had an alliance with the Eastern Franks since 860 and was aware that the larger distance between the two countries was an obstacle for them to yield direct influence on the future Bulgarian Church.&lt;ref name="fine118"/&gt; He was fully aware that as a neighbour Byzantium would try to interfere with Bulgarian matters.&lt;ref name="fine118"/&gt; Indeed, the Byzantine Empire was determined to place the Bulgarian Church under the jurisdiction of Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople because it hoped it could serve as a leverage to influence the Bulgarian policies, and furthermore could not allow Bulgaria to become a military tool of the Papacy that could potentially be employed by the Pope to enforce his wishes on the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning about Boris{{nbsp}}I's intentions the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael III]] invaded Bulgaria. At the time the Bulgarian army was engaged in warfare against Great Moravia to the north-east and Boris{{nbsp}}I agreed to negotiate.&lt;ref name="whittow282"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fine118"/&gt; The Byzantines' only demand was Boris{{nbsp}}I to adopt Christianity from Constantinople and to accept Byzantine clergy to evangelise the population.&lt;ref name="fine118"/&gt; Boris I conceded and was baptised in 864 taking the name of his godfather, Emperor Michael.&lt;ref name="whittow282"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest posts in the newly established Bulgarian Church were held by Byzantines who preached in Greek language. Aware of the dangers that the spiritual dependency on the Byzantine Empire could pose for Bulgaria's independence, Boris{{nbsp}}I was determined to ensure the autonomy of the Bulgarian Church under a Patriarch.&lt;ref name="fine120"/&gt; Since the Byzantines were reluctant to grant any concessions Boris I took advantage on the ongoing rivalry between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Papacy in Rome in order to prevent either of them from exerting influence in his lands through religion.&lt;ref name="fine120"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whittow283"/&gt; In 866 he sent a delegation to [[Rome]] under the high-ranking official [[Peter (diplomat)|Peter]] declaring his desire to accept Christianity in accordance with the Western rites along with 115 questions to [[Pope Nicholas I]]. The Pope's detailed answers to Boris{{nbsp}}I's questions were delivered by two bishops heading a mission to facilitate the conversion of the Bulgarian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither Nicolas{{nbsp}}I nor his successor [[Pope Adrian II|Adrian II]] agreed to recognize an autonomous Bulgarian Church, which cooled the relations between the two sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria's shift towards Rome on the other hand, made the Byzantines much more conciliatory. In 870, at the [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|Fourth Council of Constantinople]], the Bulgarian Church was recognized as an [[Autonomy|autocephalous]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] under the supreme direction of the Patriarch of Constantinople.&lt;ref name="fine125"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whittow284"&gt;{{harvnb|Whittow|1996|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of Christianity was met with opposition by large layers of the nobility. In 866 Boris{{nbsp}}I faced a major rebellion of the ''boila'' from all parts of the country. The insurgency was crushed and 52 leading ''boilas'' were executed along with their whole kin.&lt;ref name="fine119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. 2|1995|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Boris{{nbsp}}I abdicated in 889 his successor and eldest son [[Vladimir of Bulgaria|Vladimir]] (r.{{nbsp}}889–893) attempted to restore paganism but his father took arms against him and had him deposed and blinded.&lt;ref name="fine119"/&gt;

=== Bulgarian Orthodox Church ===
[[File:Saint Clement of Ohrid (icon, 13th-14th century).jpg|250px|alt=A medieval icon|thumb|A medieval icon of Saint [[Clement of Ohrid]], a high-ranking official of the Bulgarian Church, scholar, writer and enlightener of the Bulgarians and the Slavs]]
Since 870 the Bulgarian Church was autonomous under an archbishop.&lt;ref name="whittow284"/&gt; The decree of autonomy under the nominal ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Constantinople was far greater than could possibly had been achieved under the Papacy.&lt;ref name="fine125"/&gt; Following the Fourth Council of Constantinople the Byzantine clergy was once again admitted to Bulgaria and allowed to preach in Greek.&lt;ref name="fine125"/&gt; However, as a result of the [[Council of Preslav]] in 893 Old Bulgarian was declared the official language of the state and the Church and the Greek-speaking Byzantine priests had to leave the country. Thus, the church was entirely staffed by Bulgarians.&lt;ref name="fine134"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boris{{nbsp}}I's successor Simeon{{nbsp}}I was not content to have the Bulgarian Church with the rank of archbishopric and was determined to raise it to a patriarchate, in light of his own ambition to become an emperor. He was well acquainted with the Byzantine imperial tradition that the autocrat must have a patriarch and there could be no empire without a patriarchate.&lt;ref name="zlatarski389"&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|p=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of his remarkable triumph over the Byzantines in the battle of Achelous, in 918 he convened a council and elevated the archbishop [[Leontius of Bulgaria|Leontius]] as a patriarch.&lt;ref name="zlatarski389"/&gt; The decisions of that council were not recognized by the Byzantines&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as a result of the Bulgarian victory in the war they eventually recognized Leontius' successor [[Demetrius of Bulgaria|Demetrius]] as Patriarch of Bulgaria in 927.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lalkov|1996|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first Patriarchate officially accepted, apart from the ancient [[Pentarchy]]. It is likely that the seat of the Patriarchate was in the city of [[Silistra|Drastar]] on the Danube River rather than in the capital Preslav.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zlatarski|1972|pp=507–508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 10th century the Bulgarian Patriarchate included the following dioceses: [[Ohrid]], [[Kastoria|Kostur]], Glavinitsa (in modern southern Albania), [[Almopia|Maglen]], [[Pelagonia]], [[Strumica|Strumitsa]], Morovizd (in modern northern Greece), [[Kyustendil|Velbazhd]], [[Sofia|Serdica]], [[Braničevo (region)|Braničevo]], [[Niš]], [[Belgrade]], [[Sirmium|Srem]], [[Skopje]], [[Prizren]], [[Lipljan]], [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], [[Silistra|Drastar]], [[Edessa, Greece|Voden]], [[Stari Ras|Ras]], [[Çermenikë|Chernik]], [[Himarë (town)|Himara]], [[Dropull|Drinopol]], [[Buthrotum|Butrint]], [[Ioannina|Yanina]], [[Petra, Pieria|Petra]] and [[Kalabaka|Stag]].&lt;ref name="angelov357"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Charters of Basil II" in GIBI, vol.{{nbsp}}VI, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, [http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/6/gal/6_041.html pp. 41]–[http://www.promacedonia.org/gibi/6/gal/6_047.html pp. 47]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the eastern parts of the empire under Byzantine occupation in 971 the seat of the Patriarchate was relocated to [[Ohrid]] in the west.&lt;ref name="whittow297"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=191–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the final conquest of Bulgaria in 1018 the Patriarchate was demoted to an [[Archbishopric of Ohrid|archbishopric]] but retained many privileges. It kept control of all existing episcopal sees, the seat remained in Ohrid and its titular, the Bulgarian [[John of Debar]], kept his office. Furthermore, the Bulgarian archbishopric was given a special position{{snds}}it was placed directly under the emperor rather than under the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople.&lt;ref name="fine199"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whittow388"/&gt;

[[Monasticism]] grew steadily and the monasteries quickly became major landowners with large population of peasants living their estates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; It developed further under the reign of Emperor Peter I, accompanied with augmentation of their properties.&lt;ref name="fine169"/&gt; Many high-ranking nobles and members of the ruling family tonsured and died as monks, including Boris I, his brother [[Doks of Bulgaria|Doks]], Peter I, the ''ichirgu-boila'' [[Mostich]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing opulence of monastic life led to an increase of asceticism among more pious monks. One of them, [[John of Rila]], became a hermit in the [[Rila]] Mountains and his virtues soon attracted a number of followers,&lt;ref name="fine169"/&gt; who founded the renowned [[Rila Monastery]] after his death. He preached about living in harmony and stressed the value of manual labour and the need the monks never to aspire to riches and power.&lt;ref name="fine169"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; John of Rila was revered as a saint while he was still alive and eventually became patron of the Bulgarian people.

In the 10th century Bulgarian clerics established connections with the emerging Christian communities in the Rus'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria seems to had been an established centre from where the small number of [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]] Christians obtained clergy and liturgical texts.&lt;ref name="fine187"/&gt; As a result of the Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria many of his soldiers were influenced by Christianity and maintained that interest after their return. The connections between Bulgarians and [[Ruthenians]] must be considered an important background to the official [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|conversion to Christianity of Kievan Rus']] in 988.&lt;ref name="fine187"/&gt;

=== Bogomilism ===
{{main|Bogomilism}}
[[File:Bogomilist expansion.svg|250px|alt=A map of the Bogomilist expansion in Europe|thumb|Expansion of [[Bogomilism]] in medieval Europe]]
During the reign of Emperor Peter{{nbsp}}I (r.{{nbsp}}927–969) in Bulgaria arose a [[Heresy|heretical]] movement known as [[Bogomilism]]. The heresy was named after its founder the priest [[Bogomil (priest)|Bogomil]] whose name can be translated as dear (''mil'') to God (''Bog''). The main sources about Bogomilism in Bulgaria come from a letter of the Ecumenical Patriarch [[Theophylact of Constantinople]] to Peter I (c.{{nbsp}}940), a treatise by [[Cosmas the Priest]] (c.{{nbsp}}970) and the anti-Bogomil council of Emperor [[Boril of Bulgaria]] (1211).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bogomilism was a [[Christian Gnosticism|neo-Gnostic]] and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]] sect that believed that God had two sons, [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Satan]], that represented the two principles [[good and evil]].&lt;ref name="fine176"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; God had created light and the invisible world, while Satan rebelled and created darkness, the material world and man.&lt;ref name="fine176"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kazhdan301"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they rejected marriage, reproduction, the Church, the [[Old Testament]], the Cross, etc.&lt;ref name="fine173"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bogomils were divided into several categories, led by the ''perfecti'' (the perfect ones) that never married, consumed no meat and wine and preached the gospel. Women too could become ''perfecti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=383, 387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other two categories were the ''believers'', who had to adopt and follow most of the Bogomil moral ethics, and the ''listeners'', who were not required to change their lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bogomils were described by Cosmas as looking docile, modest and silent from the outside, but being hypocrites and ravenous wolves in the inside.&lt;ref name="Kazhdan301"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fine173"/&gt; The Bulgarian Orthodox Church condemned the teachings of Bogomilism and members of the sect were persecuted by the state authorities as well since the Bogomils preached civil disobedience because as anything earthly the state was considered to be linked with Satan.&lt;ref name="Kazhdan301"/&gt; The sect could not be eradicated and from Bulgaria it eventually spread to the rest of the Balkans, the Byzantine Empire, southern France and northern Italy. In certain regions of Western Europe the heresy flourished under different names{{snds}}[[Catharism|Cathars]], Albigensians, Patarins{{snds}}until the 14th century.&lt;ref name="fine176"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kazhdan301"/&gt;

== Formation of Bulgarian nationality ==
The Bulgarian state existed before the formation of the Bulgarian people.&lt;ref name="fine129"/&gt; Prior to the establishment of the Bulgarian state the Slavs had mingled with the native Thracian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population and the density of the settlements increased after 681 and the differences between the individual Slavic tribes gradually disappeared as communications became regular between the regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the second half of the 9th century, Bulgars and Slavs had lived together for almost two centuries and the more numerous Slavs were on the way to assimilate the Bulgars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fine128"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Bulgars had already started to use the Slavic Old Bulgarian language while the Turkic Bulgar language gradually died out leaving only certain words and terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pounds|first=Normal J.

== Culture ==

The cultural heritage of the First Bulgarian Empire is usually defined in Bulgarian historiography as the Pliska-Preslav culture, named after the first two capitals, [[Pliska]] and [[Preslav]], where most of the surviving monuments are concentrated. Many monuments of that period have been found around [[Madara (village)|Madara]], [[Shumen]], [[Novi Pazar, Bulgaria|Novi Pazar]], the village of [[Han Krum (village)|Han Krum]] in north-eastern Bulgaria, as well in the territory of modern Romania, where Romanian archaeologists called it the "[[Dridu culture]]".&lt;ref name="angelov186"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remains left by the First Empire have also been discovered in southern [[Bessarabia]], now divided between [[Ukraine]] and [[Moldova]], as well as in modern Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Greece.&lt;ref name="whittow293"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Чеботаренко|first=Г.

=== Architecture ===

==== Civil architecture ====
The first capital Pliska initially resembled a huge encampment spanning an area of 23{{nbsp}}km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the eastern and western sides measuring some 7{{nbsp}}km in length, the northern{{snds}}3.9{{nbsp}}km, and the southern{{snds}}2.7{{nbsp}}km. The whole area was encircled by a trench 3.5{{nbsp}}m wide in the foundation and 12{{nbsp}}m wide in the upper part and earthen escarpment with similar proportions{{snds}}12{{nbsp}}m wide in the foundation and 3.5{{nbsp}}m in the upper past.&lt;ref name="angelov181"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner town measured 740{{nbsp}}m to the north and to the south, 788{{nbsp}}m to the west, and 612{{nbsp}}m to the east. It was protected by stone walls 10{{nbsp}}m high and 2.6{{nbsp}}m thick, constructed by large carved blocks.&lt;ref name="angelov181"/&gt; There were four gates, each protected by two pairs of quadrangular towers. The corners were protected by cylindrical towers and there were pentagonal towers between each corner and gate tower.&lt;ref name="angelov181"/&gt; The inner town harboured the Khan's palace, temples, and nobility houses. The palace complex included baths, a pool and a heating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were several inns, as well as numerous shops and workshops.&lt;ref name="Angelov et al 1981 182"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Pliska-svik.jpg|250px|left|thumb|alt=Medieval ruins|The ruins of [[Pliska]], the first capital of Bulgaria]]
The Bulgarians also constructed forts with residences, called by the contemporary Byzantine authors ''auls'', or fortified palaces.&lt;ref name="Angelov et al 1981 182"/&gt; An example of this type of construction is the [[Palace of Omurtag|Aul of Omurtag]], mentioned in the Chatalar Inscription, which bears many similarities with Pliska, such as the presence of baths and the usage of monumental construction techniques with large carved limestone blocks.&lt;ref name="angelov185"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologists have discovered a damaged lion statue that was originally 1 m in height and matches the description in the inscription: "In the field of Pliska staying he [Omurtag] made a court/camp (aulis) at [the river] Ticha ... and skillfully erected a bridge at Ticha together with the camp [he put] four columns and above the columns he erected two lions."&lt;ref name="angelov185"/&gt; The same method of construction was employed in the fortress on the Danubian island of [[Păcuiul lui Soare]] (in modern Romania), where the gate is similar in plan with those at Pliska, Preslav and the Aul of Omurtag.&lt;ref name="angelov185"/&gt; Further north on the southern slopes of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] was located the fortress Slon, which was an important juncture that connected the salt mines of [[Transylvania]] with the lands to the south of the Danube, and was constructed in the same manner.&lt;ref name="angelov186"/&gt;

The second capital Preslav covered an area of 5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the shape of irregular pentagon and like Pliska was divided into inner and outer town.&lt;ref name="angelov296"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city experienced an extensive construction programme under Simeon I who intended it to rival Constantinople. The inner town contained two palaces, called by the archaeologists the Western Palace and the Throne Hall that were linked.&lt;ref name="angelov296"/&gt; Very few elements of the decoration have survived{{snds}} marble plates and two monolith columns of green marble that probably enclosed the arch above the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=296–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole complex was larger than the Pliska Palace and was walled with the bath adjoining the southern wall.&lt;ref name="angelov297"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ceremonial road covered with stone plates linked the northern gate and the palace complex and formed a spacious plaza in front of it.&lt;ref name="angelov300"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer town housed estates, churches, monasteries, workshops and dwellings.&lt;ref name="angelov297"/&gt; Adjoined to the outer side of southern gates of the inner town there was a large trading edifice with 18 rooms for commerce on the first floor and accommodation rooms on the second.&lt;ref name="angelov298"/&gt; The most common plan of the commercial, artesian and residential monastic edifices was rectangular with the first floor being used for production, and the second one{{snds}} for living. Some of the buildings had marble or ceramic tile floors, and others had [[veranda]]s on the second floor.&lt;ref name="angelov298"/&gt; There were two types of plumbing{{snds}}made of masonry or of clay pipes that brought water from the mountains to the city.&lt;ref name="angelov300"/&gt;

After the adoption of Christianity in 864, intensive construction of churches and monasteries began throughout the Empire. Many of them were erected over the old pagan temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new sacral architecture altered the appearance of the cities and fortresses.&lt;ref name="angelov233"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; This construction was sponsored by the state but also by donations by rich people, known as ''[[ktitor]]s''.&lt;ref name="angelov233"/&gt; Among the first places of worship to be constructed after 864 was the [[Great Basilica of Pliska]]. It was one of the biggest structures of the time, as well as contemporary Europe's longest church, with rectangular shape reaching 99{{nbsp}}m in length.&lt;ref name="angelov427"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basilica was divided into two almost equal parts{{snds}}a spacious [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] and the main building.&lt;ref name="angelov427"/&gt;

During the reign of Simeon{{nbsp}}I the domed [[cruciform]] type of church building was introduced and same to dominate the country's sacral architecture.&lt;ref name="angelov300"/&gt; Preslav was adorned with tens of churches and at least eight monasteries. The churches were decorated with ceramics, plastic elements and a variety of decorative forms.&lt;ref name="angelov301"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading example of the city's ecclesiastic architecture is the splendid [[Round Church, Preslav|Round Church]]. It was a domed [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] with a two-tiered colonnade in the interior and a walled atrium with niches and columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=300–301}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kazhdan335"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of the church had been influenced by [[Armenia]]n, [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Carolingian architecture]].&lt;ref name="kazhdan335"/&gt; There were also a number of cave monasteries, such as the [[Murfatlar Cave Complex]], where excavations have revealed stone relief murals and inscriptions in three alphabets{{snds}}Glagolitic, Cyrillic and Greek, as well as Bulgar runes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the region of [[Kutmichevitsa]] to the south-west, Clement of Ohrid oversaw the construction of the [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|Monastery of Saint Panteleimon]] and two churches with "round and spherical form" in the late 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 900 the [[Monastery of Saint Naum]] was established at the expense of "the pious Bulgarian Tsar Michael-Boris and his son Tsar Simeon" on the shores of [[Lake Ohrid]] at some 30{{nbsp}}km to the south of the town as a major literary centre.&lt;ref name="angelov233"/&gt; Other important buildings were the [[Church of St. Sophia, Ohrid|Church of Saint Sophia]] in Ohrid the Basilica of [[Achillius of Larissa|Saint Achillius]] on and island in [[Lake Prespa]] with dimensions of 30 х 50{{nbsp}}m, both modelled after the Great Basilica of Pliska.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=428}}&lt;/ref&gt; These churches had three [[nave]]s and three [[apse]]s.&lt;ref name="angelov427"/&gt; Preserved edifices from that period that provide evidence of the rich and settled Bulgarian culture at the time include three small churches dated from the late 9th or early 10th centuries in [[Kastoria|Kostur]] and the church in the village of [[Agios Germanos|German]] (both in modern Greece).&lt;ref name="whittow293"/&gt;

The most representative surviving art monument is the [[Madara Rider]], a large relief carving commissioned by Khan Tervel following his triumph in 705. It is the only relief of its kind, having no parallel in Europe.&lt;ref name="madara"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/43|title=Madara Rider|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Official Site of UNESCO|accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relief depicts a composition of a horseman, a lion and a dog at 23 m above ground level in an almost vertical 100 m high cliff of the [[Madara Plateau]].&lt;ref name="angelov309"&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; All figures are in motion. The rider, facing right, is thrusting a spear into the lion lying at his horse's feet, and on the left the dog is running after the horseman.&lt;ref name="angelov309"/&gt; The carving of the horseman halo, garments, as well the bird in front of the horseman face, are barely recognizable due to the erosion and bad condition of the monument.&lt;ref name="angelov309"/&gt; The Madara Rider was included in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]] in 1979.&lt;ref name="madara"/&gt;

The meaning and symbolism of the depiction is uncertain, as well its actual masonry tradition and cultural source.&lt;ref name="Sophoulis83"&gt;{{harvnb|Sophoulis|2011|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the relief is connected with the Bulgar ethnogenesis{{snds}}the [[Eurasian nomads|semi-nomadic equestrian warrior]] culture from the [[Eurasian Steppe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donchev |first=Slavi |title=The Madara Horseman |url=http://www.icomos.org/monumentum/vol23-24/vol23-24_6.pdf|volume=23–24 |date=1981|publisher=[[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Madara Rider bears resemblance to the Persian [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rock [[relief]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|pp=334–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sophoulis83"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donchev |first=Slavi |title=The Madara Horseman |url=http://www.icomos.org/monumentum/vol23-24/vol23-24_6.pdf|volume=23–24 |date=1981|publisher=[[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hero-horseman is also a common character of Turko-Altaic and [[Alans|Alanic]] mythology.&lt;ref name="Sophoulis83"/&gt; It is sometimes considered that the horseman represents or is related to the Bulgar deity Tangra, while Russian philologist [[Vladimir Toporov]] related it to the Iranian deity [[Mithra]].&lt;ref name="Sophoulis83"/&gt; Some considered it an example of the [[Thracian horseman]]{{snds}}a recurring motif of a deity in the form of a horseman in the [[Paleo-Balkanic mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Donchev |first=Slavi |title=The Madara Horseman |url=http://www.icomos.org/monumentum/vol23-24/vol23-24_6.pdf|volume=23–24 |date=1981|publisher=[[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS]]|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculpture and stone carving were well-developed to supply the demand for public and sacral buildings. Many details of marble carving have been excavated in Preslav. The decoration included animals such as [[griffin]]s, rabbits and birds, as well as vegetative elements (most often [[palmette]]s and grape leaves) and geometric motifs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|pp=307–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also three-dimensional animal figures discovered in church No. 1 in Preslav, including heads of lions and lionesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main sources for Bulgarian domestic use-oriented [[pottery]] are the [[necropolis|necropoleis]] at Novi Pazar, [[Devnya]], and [[Varna]].&lt;ref name="angelov309"/&gt; The vessels were made with a [[potter's wheel]], unlike Slavic practice. Since the 9th century two-story ovens were used for the annealing of the pottery.&lt;ref name="angelov309"/&gt; The shape and decoration of the early Bulgarian pottery was similar to that found in northern [[Caucasus]], the [[Crimea]], and the shores of the [[Sea of Azov]]. The growing exchange with the Byzantine Empire following the adoption of Christianity led to an increase in the shapes and decorations of the Bulgarian pottery that was unprecedented in the Slavic world.&lt;ref name="angelov309"/&gt;

One of the most famous features of the Pliska-Preslav culture was the decoration of palaces and churches with lacquered ceramic plates, which may indicate a Near Eastern (Arabic) influence.&lt;ref name="kazhdan335"/&gt; They were produced of white clay, known also as [[Kaolinite|kaolin]].&lt;ref name="angelov301"/&gt; In the 10th century the ceramic workshops in and around Preslav produced high quality ceramic tiles in the so-called "Preslav style" that were widely used in monumental construction projects and were also exported abroad.&lt;ref name="fine133"/&gt; Many of them were marked with Cyrillic or Glagolitic letters on the rear side.&lt;ref name="angelov309"/&gt; Archaeologists have discovered tile of that style in Kiev, showing Bulgarian influences in Kievan Rus.&lt;ref name="fine187"/&gt; The ceramic plates were painted mostly to include geometric or vegetative elements and sometimes birds. Some had depictions of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin]], saints and apostles, both in full figures, portraits and medallions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=2084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the destruction of Pliska and Preslav, only fragments and details of the ceramic decoration have survived. Among the most notable of those is the well-preserved, 20-tile ''Icon of St Theodore'', found in the ruins of the [[Patleina Monastery]] of Saint Panteleimon in the outskirts of Preslav which was the site of one of the workshops.&lt;ref name="kazhdan335"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angelov309"/&gt; The extensive use of ceramic decoration in Preslav and the nearby churches and monasteries most probably pre-dates its widespread use in Constantinople.&lt;ref name="kazhdan335"/&gt;

[[File:Old Bulgarian Alphabet.png|250px|thumb|alt=An alphabet|The [[Early Cyrillic Alphabet|Old Bulgarian alphabet]]]]
{{see also|Old Church Slavonic|Glagolitic alphabet|Cyrillic script}}
Although the Boris{{nbsp}}I had succeeded in securing an autonomous Church, the higher clergy and theological books were still Greek, which impeded the efforts to convert the populace to the new religion. Between 860 and 863 the Byzantine monks [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]] created the [[Glagolitic alphabet]], the first Slavic alphabet by order of the Byzantine Emperor, who aimed to convert [[Great Moravia]] to Orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref name="whittow284"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fine113"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language they used was called by later historians [[Old Church Slavonic]] and was based on the local Slavic dialect spoken in the region of [[Thessaloniki]],&lt;ref name="fine113"/&gt; hence it is also known as Old Bulgarian. Ultimately, the brothers' mission to establish Slavic liturgy in Great Moravia failed.&lt;ref name="Fine 1991 114"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 886 their disciples [[Clement of Ohrid|Clement]], [[Saint Naum|Naum]] and Angelarius, who had been banished from Great Moravia, reached Bulgaria and received a warm welcome by Boris I.&lt;ref name="fine127"/&gt; They began to preach in Bulgaria and thus the work of the Slavic mission of Cyril and Methodius was saved.&lt;ref name="fine127"/&gt;

The Bulgarian monarch commissioned the creation of two theological academies to be headed by the disciples where the future Bulgarian clergy was to be instructed in Bulgarian vernacular. Clement was sent to the southwestern province [[Kutmichevitsa]] in Macedonia, where he founded the [[Ohrid Literary School]]. There, he educated 3,500 pupils between 886 and 907.&lt;ref name="fine128"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naum established the literary school in the capital Pliska, which moved later to the new capital Preslav. Eventually, Naum too was sent to Ohrid.&lt;ref name="fine128"/&gt; The rationale to centre the literary activities far away from the capital was that at the time a Byzantine archbishop still resided in Pliska.&lt;ref name="fine128"/&gt; In the late 9th or the early 10th century the [[Cyrillic script]] was created at the [[Preslav Literary School]].&lt;ref name="fine136"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on the Greek letters and included a number of original ones for sounds that were non-existent in Greek, adding 14 letters to the existing 24 Greek ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angelov et al|1981|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few decades the new script replaced the Glagolitic alphabet in Bulgaria and eventually spread in the whole Eastern Orthodox Slavic world.&lt;ref name="fine136"/&gt; Today more than 250 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages.

[[File:DidacticGospelAlphabetPrayerConstantinePreslavski.jpg|250px|thumb|left|alt=A page of a medieval manuscript|A page with the ''Alphabet Prayer'' by [[Constantine of Preslav]]]]
One of the first original works was ''On the Letters'' (''О писмєньхъ'') by Chernorizets Hrabar, where he defended the Cyrillic alphabet against its Byzantine Greek critics and proved not only its right to existence but also its superiority to the [[Greek alphabet]] arguing that the Greek letters were neither the oldest known to man, nor divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|pp=134–136}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the form of rhetoric questions and answers ''On the Letters'' demonstrated excellent historic and linguistic knowledge of Chernorizets Hrabar, as he indicated that "God did not first create the Hebrew or the Greek language, but Syrian which Adam spoke..."&lt;ref name="fine135"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1991|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; and underlined that "Before then the Greeks had no alphabet of their own but wrote their speech with [[Phoenicia]]n letters."&lt;ref name="fine135"/&gt; Constantine of Preslav and John the Exarch combined translated and adapted Byzantine works with original texts.&lt;ref name="kazhdan336"/&gt; The latter compiled the ''Shestodnev'' (''Шестоднев'' – [[Hexameron]]) that included valuable first-hand evidence about the Bulgarian Empire under Simeon I. Constantine of Preslav's ''Didactic Gospel'' was the first systematic work treating sermons in Slavic literature that also featured the poetic preface ''Azbuchna molitva'' (''Азбучна молитва'' – Alphabet Prayer), the first original poetry in Bulgarian language. Later, [[Cosmas the Priest]] wrote the anti-Bogomil treatise ''Sermon Against the Heretics'' which apart from the theological arguments contained criticism on the contemporary Bulgarian society, with particular attention to religious and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andreev|Lazarov|Pavlov|1999|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the official literature, [[Apocrypha|apocryphical texts]] were also written and received impetus after the second half of the 10th century, as imperial patronage ceased during the Byzantine conquest and subsequent Byzantine rule in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="kazhdan336"/&gt; One such work expressing the Bulgarian aspirations and fears was ''Tale of the Cross Tree'' by [[Jeremiah (Bulgarian priest)|Jeremiah the Priest]] that was considered heretical and was banned by the Orthodox Church.&lt;ref name="kazhdan336"/&gt;

The flourishing literary activity and the experimentation with various genres developed the style, flexibility and expressiveness of the language.&lt;ref name="kazhdan336"/&gt; The literature produced in the Old Bulgarian language soon spread north and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Balkans and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schenker|first=Alexander M.|authorlink=Alexander M.

'''Funky Elephant''' is an annual springtime [[music festival]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. It's dedicated to a vast variety of styles within [[African American music|black rhythm music]]. Genres represented include [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[Latin American music|Latin]], [[reggae]], [[afrobeat]] etc. Funky Elephant has been organized since 1994.

The festival is held at [[Tavastia Club]] and its smaller sub-club downstairs, Semifinal. The clubs are located in the very center of Helsinki.

During the years, the festival has had such performers as
* [[Sharon Jones &amp; The Dap-Kings]]
* [[Roy Ayers]]
* [[Joe Bataan]]
* Pucho &amp; the Latin Soul Brothers
* [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]]
* [[DJ Vadim]] &amp; One Self

Plus, many highly acclaimed [[Disc jockey|DJs]] of the genre.

Overall, the festival has had over 100 live performances and over 70 DJs.

The organizer is Funky Amigos, which is a non-profit association. Its aim is to enhance the status of modern rhythm music scene and its artists in Finland. In wider prospect, Funky Amigos also wants to encourage multi-culturality and tolerance.

Other Funky Amigos' events include
* The Funk Awards, a gala event to give recognition to those Finns who have kept the scene showcased domestically. Held annually since 2000.
* The Baby Elephant Tour, a chance for the lesser-known, up and coming Finnish artists to tour clubs around Finland.

Besides these, Funky Amigos randomly organizes other events depending on its resources. The goal is to have some kind of activity going on all year-round.

The '''Georgian Theatre Royal''' is a theatre and historic [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Theater (structure)|playhouse]] in the market town of [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]], [[North Yorkshire]], England. It is among the oldest of Britain's extant theatres.&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

==History==
It was built in 1788 by the actor-manager Samuel Butler (died 1812 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=2747-gtr&lt;/ref&gt;) and was one of his circuit of theatres, the others being located in [[Beverley]], [[Harrogate]], [[Kendal]], [[Northallerton]], [[Ripon]], [[Ulverston]] and [[Whitby]], though none of these are now open. Regular performances at the theatre continued until 1830, when performances became less frequent and in 1848 it was let as an auction house. The Georgian Theatre Royal was reopened by a non-profit trust in 1963, it was expanded in 1996 and had major restoration works, including the addition of a museum, costing £1.6 million in 2002, reopening once again in 2003.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;
August 2016 saw the opening of The Georgian Theatre Royal Experience, a small but perfectly formed museum, detailing the history of the theatre and displaying artifacts from the theatre's collection, as well as The Woodland Scene, reported to be the oldest surviving stage scenery in the world. In addition, the Paul Iles Learning Centre was reopened following extensive renovation, and now houses The Georgian Theatre Royal Youth Theatre as well as many events including volunteer open days, book groups and costume making sessions.

==Theatre building==
It is now fully restored and seats 214.  The building is [[listed building|Grade I listed]].&lt;ref name=GTR/&gt; and has hosted Georgian star [[Edmund Kean]], and other figures such as Dame [[Sybil Thorndike]], [[Joyce Grenfell]] and [[Alan Bennett]]. The venue also houses a 180-member youth theatre.
The Theatre Royal possesses the oldest known set of theatrical scenery in existence.  Known as 'The Woodland Scene', it was painted in a workshop in [[Royston, Hertfordshire]] and dates back to around 1820.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/ru5laUATRKm7PAkS5Er9Cg The Woodland Scene - theatre scenery].

==Closure threat==
On 1 May 2013 it launched a funding campaign to save it from closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-22310360|title=Appeal to save Richmond's historic Georgian Theatre Royal|last=Youngs|first=Ian|date=28 April 2013|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was seeking to raise an initial £122,500.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29321">[[File:Hard disk failure.jpeg|thumb|A head crash, one type of disk failure]]

A '''hard disk drive failure''' occurs when a [[hard disk drive]] malfunctions and the stored information cannot be accessed with a properly configured computer.

A hard disk failure may occur in the course of normal operation, or due to an external factor such as exposure to fire or water or high [[magnetic field]]s, or suffering a sharp [[impact (mechanics)|impact]] or environmental contamination, which can lead to a [[head crash]].

Hard drives may also be rendered inoperable through [[data corruption]], disruption or destruction of the hard drive's [[master boot record]], or through [[malware]] deliberately destroying the disk's contents.

== Causes ==
Some hard disk drives simply fail because of worn out parts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Joel|title=How To Care For Your Hard Drives And Make Them Last Longer|url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/care-hard-drives-make-last-longer/|publisher=Make Use Of|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=What parts? Mechanical parts, or frequently accessed platter areas?|date=February 2016}} others fail prematurely. Drive manufacturers typically specify a [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF) or an [[annualized failure rate]] (AFR) which are population statistics that can not predict the behavior of an individual unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scheier|first1=Robert|title=Study: Hard Drive Failure Rates Much Higher Than Makers Estimate|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/129558/article.html |publisher=PC World|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are calculated by constantly running samples of the drive for a short period of time, analyzing the resultant wear and tear upon the physical components of the drive, and extrapolating to provide a reasonable estimate of its lifespan. Hard disk drive failures tend to follow the concept of the [[bathtub curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How long do hard drives actually live for?|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/170748-how-long-do-hard-drives-actually-live-for|publisher=ExtremeTech|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drives typically fail within a short time if there is a defect present from manufacturing. If a drive proves reliable for a period of a few months after installation, the drive has a significantly greater chance of remaining reliable. Therefore, even if a drive is subjected to several years of heavy daily use, it may not show any notable signs of wear unless closely inspected. On the other hand, a drive can fail at any time in many different situations.

The most notorious cause of drive failure is a [[head crash]], where the internal [[disk read-and-write head|read-and-write head]] of the device, usually just hovering above the surface, touches a [[Hard-disk platter|platter]], or scratches the magnetic [[data storage device|data-storage]] surface. A head crash usually incurs severe [[data loss]], and [[data recovery]] attempts may cause further damage if not done by a specialist with proper equipment. Drive platters are coated with an extremely thin layer of non-[[electrostatic]] lubricant, so that the read-and-write head will simply glance off the surface of the platter should a collision occur. However, this head hovers mere [[nanometers]] from the platter's surface which makes a collision an acknowledged risk. Another cause of failure is a faulty [[air filter]]. The air filters on today's drives equalize the [[atmospheric pressure]] and moisture between the drive enclosure and its outside environment. If the filter fails to capture a dust particle, the particle can land on the platter, causing a head crash if the head happens to sweep over it. After a head crash, particles from the damaged platter and head media can cause one or more [[bad sectors]]. These, in addition to platter damage, will quickly render a drive useless. A drive also includes controller electronics, which occasionally fail. In such cases, it may be possible to recover all data.


{{Irrelevant|paragraph}}
The phenomenon of disk failure is not limited only to drives, but also applies to other types of magnetic media. In the late 1990s, [[Iomega]]'s 100-megabyte Zip disks used in [[Zip drive]]s were affected by the [[click of death]], called so because the drives endlessly clicked when accessed, indicating the impending failure. 3.5-inch [[floppy disk]]s can also fall victim to disk failure. If either the drive or the media is dirty, users may experience the [[buzz of death]] when attempting to access the drive.

== Signs of drive failure ==
Failure of a hard disk drive can be catastrophic or gradual. The former typically presents as a drive that can no longer be detected by [[CMOS setup]], or that fails to pass [[BIOS POST]] so that the operating system never sees it. Gradual hard-drive failure can be harder to diagnose, because its symptoms, such as corrupted data and slowing down of the PC (caused by gradually failing areas of the hard drive requiring repeated read attempts before successful access), can be caused by many other computer issues, such as [[malware]]. A rising number of bad sectors can be a sign of a failing hard drive, but because the hard drive automatically adds them to its own growth defect table,&lt;ref name="AutoJK-3"/&gt; they may not become evident to utilities such as [[ScanDisk]] unless the utility can catch them before the hard drive's defect management system does, or the backup sectors held in reserve by the [[internal hard-drive defect management]] system run out. A cyclical repetitive pattern of seek activity such as rapid or slower seek-to-end noises ([[click of death]]) can be indicative of hard drive problems.&lt;ref name="AutoJK-4"/&gt;

=== Landing zones and load/unload technology ===
[[File:Rwheadmacro.jpg|thumb|Read/write head from circa-1998 [[Fujitsu]] 3.5" hard disk (approx. 2.0 mm x 3.0 mm)]]
[[File:Rwheadmicro.JPG|thumb|[[Micrograph|Microphotograph]] of an older generation hard disk drive head and slider (1990s)]]
[[File:WD102AA Scratched area read retries.ogg|thumb|Noises from an old hard drive while attempting to read data from bad sectors]]

During normal operation, heads in HDDs fly above the data recorded on the disks. Modern HDDs prevent power interruptions or other malfunctions from landing its heads in the data zone by either physically moving (''parking'') the heads to a special ''landing zone'' on the platters that is not used for data storage, or by physically locking the heads in a suspended (''unloaded'') position raised off the platters. Some early PC HDDs did not park the heads automatically when power was prematurely disconnected and the heads would land on data. In some other early units the user would run a program to manually park the heads.

==== Landing zones ====
A ''landing zone'' is an area of the platter usually near its inner diameter (ID), where no data is stored. This area is called the Contact Start/Stop (CSS) zone. Disks are designed such that either a [[spring (device)|spring]] or, more recently, rotational [[inertia]] in the platters is used to park the heads in the case of unexpected power loss. In this case, the [[brushless DC electric motor|spindle motor]] temporarily acts as a [[electrical generator|generator]], providing power to the actuator.

Spring tension from the head mounting constantly pushes the heads towards the platter. While the disk is spinning, the heads are supported by an air bearing and experience no physical contact or wear. In CSS drives the sliders carrying the head sensors (often also just called ''heads'') are designed to survive a number of landings and takeoffs from the media surface, though wear and tear on these microscopic components eventually takes its toll. Most manufacturers design the sliders to survive 50,000 contact cycles before the chance of damage on startup rises above 50%. However, the decay rate is not linear: when a disk is younger and has had fewer start-stop cycles, it has a better chance of surviving the next startup than an older, higher-mileage disk (as the head literally drags along the disk's surface until the air bearing is established). For example, the Seagate Barracuda 7200.10 series of desktop hard disk drives are rated to 50,000 start&amp;ndash;stop cycles, in other words no failures attributed to the head&amp;ndash;platter interface were seen before at least 50,000 start&amp;ndash;stop cycles during testing.&lt;ref name="AutoMK-84"/&gt;

Around 1995 IBM pioneered a technology where a landing zone on the disk is made by a precision laser process (''Laser Zone Texture'' = LZT) producing an array of smooth nanometer-scale "bumps" in a landing zone,&lt;ref name="AutoMK-85"/&gt; thus vastly improving [[stiction]] and wear performance. This technology is still largely in use today, predominantly in desktop and enterprise (3.5-inch) drives. In general, CSS technology can be prone to increased stiction (the tendency for the heads to stick to the platter surface), e.g. as a consequence of increased humidity. Excessive stiction can cause physical damage to the platter and slider or spindle motor.

==== Unloading ====
''Load/unload'' technology relies on the heads being lifted off the platters into a safe location, thus eliminating the risks of wear and [[stiction]] altogether. The first HDD [[IBM 305 RAMAC|RAMAC]] and most early disk drives used complex mechanisms to load and unload the heads. Modern HDDs use ramp loading, first introduced by [[Memorex]] in 1967,&lt;ref name="AutoMK-86"/&gt; to load/unload onto plastic "ramps" near the outer disk edge.

Addressing shock robustness, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] also created a technology for their [[ThinkPad]] line of laptop computers called the Active Protection System. When a sudden, sharp movement is detected by the built-in [[accelerometer]] in the Thinkpad, internal hard disk heads automatically unload themselves to reduce the risk of any potential data loss or scratch defects. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] later also utilized this technology in their [[PowerBook]], [[iBook]], [[MacBook Pro]], and [[MacBook]] line, known as the [[Sudden Motion Sensor]]. [[VAIO|Sony]],&lt;ref name="AutoMK-87"/&gt; HP with their HP 3D DriveGuard&lt;ref name="AutoMK-88"/&gt; and [[Toshiba]]&lt;ref name="AutoMK-89"/&gt; have released similar technology in their notebook computers.

=== Modes of failure ===
Hard drives may fail in a number of ways. Failure may be immediate and total, progressive, or limited. Data may be totally destroyed, or partially or totally recoverable.

Earlier drives had a tendency toward developing [[bad sector]]s with use and wear; these bad sectors could be "mapped out" so they were not used and did not affect operation of a drive, and this was considered normal unless many bad sectors developed in a short period of time. Some early drives even had a table attached to a drive's case on which bad sectors were to be listed as they appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adaptec.com/en-us/support/_eol/acb/acb-2072/hw_install/acb-2072.htm?nc=/en-us/support/_eol/acb/acb-2072/hw_install/acb-2072.htm Adaptec ACB-2072 XT to RLL Installation Guide] A defect list "may be put in from a file or entered from a keyboard."&lt;/ref&gt; Later drives map out bad sectors automatically, in a way invisible to the user; a drive with remapped sectors may continue to be used. Statistics and logs available through [[S.M.A.R.T]] (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) provide information about the remapping.

Other failures, which may be either progressive or limited, are usually considered to be a reason to replace a drive; the value of data potentially at risk usually far outweighs the cost saved by continuing to use a drive which may be failing. Repeated but recoverable read or write errors, unusual noises, excessive and unusual heating, and other abnormalities, are warning signs.

* ''Head crash'': a head may contact the rotating platter due to mechanical shock or other reason. At best this will cause irreversible damage and data loss where contact was made. In the worst case the debris scraped off the damaged area may contaminate all heads and platters, and destroy all data on all platters. If damage is initially only partial, continued rotation of the drive may extend the damage until it is total.&lt;ref name=headcrash/&gt;
* ''Bad sectors'': some magnetic sectors may become faulty without rendering the whole drive unusable. This may be a limited occurrence or a sign of imminent failure.
* ''Stiction'': after a time the head may not "take off" when started up as it tends to stick to the platter, a phenomenon known as [[Stiction#Hard disk drives|stiction]]. This is usually due to unsuitable lubrication properties of the platter surface, a design or manufacturing defect rather than wear. This occasionally happened with some designs until the early 1990s.
* ''Circuit failure'': components of the electronic circuitry may fail making the drive inoperable.
* ''Bearing and motor failure'': electric motors may fail or burn out, and bearings may wear enough to prevent proper operation.
* ''Miscellaneous mechanical failures'': parts, particularly moving parts, of any mechanism can break or fail, preventing normal operation, with possible further damage caused by fragments.

=== Metrics of failures ===
Most major hard disk and motherboard vendors support S.M.A.R.T, which measures drive characteristics such as [[operating temperature]], spin-up time, data error rates, etc. Certain trends and sudden changes in these parameters are thought to be associated with increased likelihood of drive failure and data loss. However, S.M.A.R.T. parameters alone may not be useful for predicting individual drive failures.&lt;ref name=google/&gt; While several S.M.A.R.T. parameters affect failure probability, a large fraction of failed drives do not produce predictive S.M.A.R.T. parameters.&lt;ref name= google /&gt; Unpredictable breakdown may occur at any time in normal use, with potential loss of all data. Recovery of some or even all data from a damaged drive is sometimes, but not always possible, and is normally costly.

A 2007 study published by [[Google]] suggested very little correlation between failure rates and either high temperature or activity level. Indeed, the Google study indicated that "one of our key findings has been the lack of a consistent pattern of higher failure rates for higher temperature drives or for those drives at higher utilization levels.".&lt;ref&gt;Conclusions: [https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/disk_failures.pdf Failure Trends in Large Disk Drive Population], p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Hard drives with S.M.A.R.T.-reported average temperatures below {{convert|27|C|abbr= on}} had higher failure rates than hard drives with the highest reported average temperature of {{convert |50|C| abbr = on}}, failure rates at least twice as high as the optimum S.M.A.R.T.-reported temperature range of {{convert |36|C| abbr=on}} to {{convert|47|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=google/&gt; The correlation between manufacturers, models and the failure rate was relatively strong. Statistics in this matter are kept highly secret by most entities; Google did not relate manufacturers' names with failure rates,&lt;ref name= "google"/&gt; though it has been revealed that Google uses Hitachi Deskstar drives in some of its servers.&lt;ref name="AutoMK-90" /&gt;

Google's 2007 study found, based on a large field sample of drives, that actual annualized failure rates ([[Annualized failure rate|AFRs]]) for individual drives ranged from 1.7% for first year drives to over 8.6% for three-year-old drives.&lt;ref&gt;AFR broken down by age groups: [https://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en//archive/disk_failures.pdf Failure Trends in Large Disk Drive Population], p. 4, figure 2 and subsequent figures.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar 2007 study at [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] on enterprise drives showed that measured MTBF was 3–4 times lower than the manufacturer's specification, with an estimated 3% mean AFR over 1–5 years based on replacement logs for a large sample of drives, and that hard drive failures were highly correlated in time.&lt;ref name="Schroeder_2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.usenix.org/events/fast07/tech/schroeder.html|author=Bianca Schroeder and Garth A. Gibson|title="Disk Failures in the Real World: What Does an MTTF of 1,000,000 Hours Mean to You?". Proceedings 5th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies. 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study of [[latent sector error]]s (as opposed to the above studies of complete disk failures) showed that 3.45% of 1.5 million disks developed latent sector errors over 32 months (3.15% of nearline disks and 1.46% of enterprise class disks developed at least one latent sector error within twelve months of their ship date), with the annual sector error rate increasing between the first and second years. Enterprise drives showed less sector errors than consumer drives. Background [[Data scrubbing|scrubbing]] was found to be effective in correcting these errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/Publications/latent-sigmetrics07.pdf|title=L.N. Bairavasundaram, GR Goodson, S. Pasupathy, J.Schindler. "An analysis of latent sector errors in disk drives". Proceedings of SIGMETRICS'07, June 12-16,2007.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Small Computer System Interface|SCSI]], [[Serial attached SCSI|SAS]], and [[Fibre Channel|FC]] drives are more expensive than consumer-grade SATA drives, and usually used in [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[disk array]]s, where SATA drives were sold to the [[home computer]] and desktop and near-line storage market and were perceived to be less reliable. This distinction is now becoming blurred.

The [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF) of SATA drives is usually specified to be about 1.2&amp;nbsp;million hours (some drives such as [[Western Digital Raptor]] have rated 1.4&amp;nbsp;million hours MTBF),&lt;ref name="AutoMK-91"/&gt; while SAS/FC drives are rated for upwards of 1.6&amp;nbsp;million hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.netapp.com/documents/tr-3437.pdf |author=Jay White |title=Technical Report: Storage Subsystem Resiliency Guide (TR-3437) |work=NetApp | page=5 |date=May 2013 &lt;!--old date, TR must have been updated and "page 5" may not still be correct: September 2011 --&gt;|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, independent research indicates that MTBF is not a reliable estimate of a drive's longevity ([[service life]]).&lt;ref name="AutoMK-92"/&gt; MTBF is conducted in laboratory environments in test chambers and is an important metric to determine the quality of a disk drive, but is designed to only measure the relatively constant failure rate over the service life of the drive (the middle of the "[[bathtub curve]]") before final wear-out phase.&lt;ref name="Schroeder_2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"One aspect of disk failures that single-value metrics such as MTTF and AFR cannot capture is that in real life failure rates are not constant. Failure rates of hardware products typically follow a "bathtub curve" with high failure rates at the beginning (infant mortality) and the end (wear-out) of the lifecycle."(Schroeder et al. 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PattersonHennessy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. Patterson|author2=John L. Hennessy|title=Computer Organization and Design, Revised Fourth Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface.

AFR is the percentage of drive failures expected per year. Both AFR and MTBF tend to measure reliability only in the initial part of the life of a hard disk drive thereby understating the real probability of failure of a used drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.snowark.com/decrypting-hard-drive-failures-mtbf-and-afr/|title=Decrypting hard-drive failures – MTBF and AFR|work=snowark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[cloud storage]] company [[Backblaze]] produces an annual report into hard drive reliability. However the company states that it mainly uses commodity consumer drives, which are deployed in enterprise conditions, rather than in their representative conditions and for their intended use. Consumer drives are also not tested to work with enterprise [[RAID]] cards of the kind used in a datacenter, and may not respond in the time a RAID controller expects; such cards will be identified as having failed when they have not.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The result of tests of this kind may be relevant or irrelevant to different users, since they accurately represent the performance of consumer drives in the enterprise or under extreme stress, but may not accurately represent their performance in normal or intended use.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Mitigation ==
In order to avoid the loss of data due to disk failure, common solutions include:

* [[Data backup]], to allow restoration of data after a failure
* [[Data scrubbing]], to detect and repair latent corruption
* [[Data redundancy]], to allow systems to tolerate failures of individual drives
* [[Active hard-drive protection]], to protect laptop drives from external mechanical forces
* [[S.M.A.R.T.]] (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) included in hard-drives, to provide early warning of predictable failure modes
* [[Base isolation]] used under server racks in data centers

== {{Anchor|ADAPTATION-DATA}}Data recovery ==
Data from a failed drive can sometimes be partially or totally [[Data recovery|recovered]] if the platters' magnetic coating is not totally destroyed. Specialised companies carry out data recovery, at significant cost, by opening the drives in a [[clean room]] and using appropriate equipment to read data from the platters directly. If the electronics have failed, it is sometimes possible to replace the electronics board, though often drives of nominally exactly the same model manufactured at different times have different circuit boards that are incompatible. Moreover, electronics boards of modern drives usually contain drive-specific ''adaptation data'' required for accessing their [[system area]]s, so the related componentry needs to be either reprogrammed (if possible) or unsoldered and transferred between two electronics boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes operation can be restored for long enough to recover data, perhaps requiring reconstruction techniques such as [[file carving]]. Risky techniques are justifiable if the drive is otherwise dead. If a drive is started up once it may continue to run for a shorter or longer time but never start again, so as much data as possible is recovered as soon as the drive starts. A 1990s drive that does not start due to stiction can sometimes be started by tapping it or rotating the body of the drive rapidly by hand.

[[File:1927 Mississippi Flood Levee Breach.jpg|thumb|right|A levee failure during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]].]]
[[File:Watersnoodramp 1953 dijkdoorbraak Den Bommel.jpg|thumb|right|A breach in a dike during the [[North Sea flood of 1953]].]]
A '''levee breach''' or '''levee failure''' (the word dike or dyke can also be used instead of [[levee]]) is a situation where a levee fails or is intentionally [[Wiktionary:Breach|breached]], causing the previously contained water to flood the land behind the levee.

==Causes of failure==
Man-made levees can fail in a number of ways.  The most frequent (and dangerous) form of levee failure is a ''breach''.  A ''levee breach'' is when part of the levee actually breaks away, leaving a large opening for water to flood the land protected by the levee.

===Foundation failure===
A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure that is caused either by surface erosion or by a subsurface failure of the levee. Levee breaches are often accompanied by levee boils, or [[sand boil]]s.  The underseepage resurfaces on the landside, in the form of a volcano-like cone of sand. Boils signal a condition of incipient instability which may lead to erosion of the levee toe or foundation or result in sinking of the levee into the liquefied foundation below. Some engineers think that boils lead to a form of [[internal erosion]] called [[Piping (erosion)|piping]] which undermines the levee, but others consider them a symptom of generalized instability of the foundation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Erosion and damage===
Surface erosion of the surface of a levee is usually caused by the action of wind and water (waves but also normal flow). Erosion can be worsened by pre-existing or new damage to a levee. Areas with no surface protection are more prone to erosion. A levee grazed by certain types of animals, like [[sheep]], can show trails used by the animals where grass does not grow.

Trees in levees are a special risk. A tree can become unstable after the soil of the levee has become saturated with water. When the tree falls the [[root|root system]] will likely take a chunk of the saturated soil out of the levee. This shallow hole can quickly erode and result in a breach. If the tree falls in the water and floats away it can damage the levee further downstream. Floating trees near levees should be quickly removed by the agency responsible for the maintenance of the levee.

Other forms of damage can be caused by ships or other (large) floating objects or from objects in the levee, like [[traffic sign]]s or fences that are damaged or completely removed by wind or water. [[Barbed wire]] fences can collect large amounts of floating plant material, resulting in a large amount of drag from the water. Whole fences can be dragged away by the water.

===Overtopping===
Sometimes levees are said to fail when water ''overtops'' the crest of the levee.  ''Levee overtopping'' can be caused when flood waters simply exceed the lowest crest of the levee system or if high winds begin to generate significant swells (a [[storm surge]]) in the ocean or river water to bring waves crashing over the levee.  Overtopping can lead to significant landside [[erosion]] of the levee or even be the mechanism for complete breach.  Often levees are armored or reinforced with rocks or concrete to prevent erosion and failure.

[[File:Kessel (North-Brabant, NL), soldatenwiel.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Kolk (vortex)|kolk]] lake in the Netherlands]]

==Kolk lakes==
After a levee breach a [[Kolk (vortex)|kolk lake]] can often be seen. This is a [[crater (disambiguation)|crater]]-like depression just behind the breach where soil and other material has been violently scoured out by the rushing water. After a breach, a kolk lake can sometimes remain after the water level recedes.

==Intentional breaches==
In some cases levees are breached intentionally. This can be done to protect other areas, to drain flooded areas, or to give back land to nature. In most cases an intentional breach is not without discussion since valuable land is given up.

During the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] a levee was blown up with [[dynamite]] to prevent the flooding of [[New Orleans]].  Again during record-breaking flooding in 2011, the US Army Corps of Engineers blew up a section of a Mississippi River levee with dynamite to open the New Madrid Floodway. The floodway was used for farming and had about 200 residents at the time. The levee at Bird's Point was designed to be removed if necessary so that Mississippi water levels would be lowered, taking pressure off levees for miles upstream in more populated areas such as [[Cairo, Illinois]], and [[New Madrid, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/us/03levee.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=A.

Taking land from the cycle of flooding by putting a dike around it prevents it from being raised by silt left behind after a flood. At the same time the drained soil [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidates]] and [[peat]] decomposes leading to land [[subsidence]]. In this way the difference between the water level on one side and land level on the other side of the dike grows. 

In some areas reclaimed land is given back to nature by breaching and removing dikes to allow flooding to occur (again). This restores the natural environment in the area. This happened in the [[Glory River]] in Iraq.

==Examples of levee breaches==

===New Orleans===
{{Main|2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans}}
The words ''levee'' and ''levee breach'' were brought heavily into the public consciousness after the levee failures in metro New Orleans on August 29, 2005 when [[Hurricane Katrina]] passed east of the city.  Levees breached in over 50 different places submerging 80 percent of the city.  Most levees failed due to water overtopping them but some failed when water passed underneath the levee foundations causing the levee wall to shift and resulting in catastrophic sudden breaching.  The sudden breaching released water at a high velocity that moved houses off their foundations and tossed cars into trees.  This happened in the [[Lower Ninth Ward]] when the [[Industrial Canal]] breached and also in the Lakeview neighborhood when the [[17th Street Canal]] breached. At least 1,464 people perished. In New Orleans, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] is the Federal agency responsible for levee design and construction as defined in the [[Flood Control Act of 1965]] and subject to local participation requirements, some of which were later waived. Fault has been aimed at the Corps of Engineers, their local contractors, and local levee boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New Study of Levees Faults Design and Construction - New York Times | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/22/us/22corps.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Schwartz | date=May 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North Sea===
{{See also|Storm tides of the North Sea}}

The [[St. Elizabeth's flood (1421)|St. Elizabeth's flood]] of 1421 was caused by a surge of seawater being forced upriver during a storm, overflowing the river dikes and submerging approximately {{convert|300|km2|sqmi|sigfig=1}} of land in the [[Netherlands]]. Estimates of people having died range from 2,000 to 10,000. Parts of the submerged lands have still not been reclaimed resulting in the [[Biesbosch]] wetlands.

During the [[North Sea flood of 1953]], in the night of 31 January – 1 February 1953, many dikes in the provinces of [[Zeeland]], [[South Holland|Zuid-Holland]] and [[North Brabant|Noord-Brabant]] in the [[Netherlands]] were unable to withstand the combination of [[spring tide]] and a northwesterly storm. The resulting flood killed 1,835 people. A further 307 people were killed by dike breaches in the [[United Kingdom]], in the [[county (England)|counties]] of [[Lincolnshire]], [[Norfolk]], [[Suffolk]] and [[Essex]]. In the Netherlands this flood was a main reason for the construction of the [[Delta Works]], probably the most innovative and extensive levee system in the world.&lt;ref name="Delta Plan, Netherlands"&gt;[http://www.7wonders.org/wonders/civil-engineering-wonders.aspx] Accessed August 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other breaches===

'''NEVER''' was a series of [[professional wrestling]] events held by [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) between August 2010 and November 2012. On July 12, 2010, NJPW officially announced the NEVER project, which was to highlight younger up-and-coming talent and outside wrestlers not signed to the promotion.&lt;ref name=NEVERAnnounced&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=28 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101228091940/http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=28 | title = Nextジェネレーション育成 新プロジェクト「NEVER」シリーズがスタート!! | archivedate=December 28, 2010 | date=July 12, 2010 | accessdate=September 10, 2014 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChampionshipAnnouncedPWTorch&gt;{{cite web | url = http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_65739.shtml | title = News items: Velvet Sky launches clothing line, Details on Nash's next int'l tour, NJPW introducing new title | last=Caldwell | first=James | date=October 5, 2012 | accessdate=September 10, 2014 | work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was explained that the name of the project was an acronym of the terms "New Blood", "Evolution", "Valiantly", "Eternal" and "Radical".&lt;ref name=NEVERAnnounced/&gt; For the events, NJPW recruited several [[freelancer]]s as well as wrestlers signed to promotions such as [[DDT Pro-Wrestling]] and [[Kaientai Dojo]]. Some outsiders who became NEVER regulars included [[Daisuke Sasaki]], Kaji Tomato, [[Madoka (wrestler)|Madoka]], Ryuichi Sekine and [[Shinobu Sugawara|Shinobu]]. [[Yujiro Kushida|Kushida]], who entered NEVER as a representative of the [[Smash (professional wrestling)|Smash]] promotion in February 2011, signed a NJPW contract the following month and returned to the project the following September, now representing NJPW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=5343 | title = Kushidaの“新日本入団会見”にTajiri&amp;酒井代表も出席！ 3.18Smash後楽園には棚橋が来場!! | date=March 8, 2011 | accessdate=September 10, 2014 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three NJPW trainees; [[Hiromu Takahashi]], [[Sho Tanaka]] and [[Yohei Komatsu]], made their professional wrestling debuts at NEVER events. Takahashi, who debuted at ''NEVER.1'', was the only wrestler who wrestled on all thirteen NEVER events.

'''''Nedjeljni Jutarnji''''' is the weekly Sunday edition of ''[[Jutarnji list]]'', one of the two prominent dailies in [[Croatia]]. ''Nedjeljni'' is principally concerned with life, culture, politics and style. Founded by Tomislav Wruss in 2003&lt;ref&gt;http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/nedjeljni-jutarnji-list-od-2-ozujka-na-kioscima/121703.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in the long tradition of Croatian Sunday papers such as [[Nedjeljna Dalmacija]], it was brasher and less polite than the daily edition of ''Jutarnji''.

''Nedjeljni'' typically publishes fewer political and more urban-tabloid and human interest stories than its daily counterpart. The approach is more populist and entertaining, yet it has also been a platform for serious debate and important crusading issues.

==Recent development ==
''Nedjeljni'' has undergone a visual re-design since June 2010. The number of pages has been expanded to about 90, in order to match the volume of Sunday papers in Britain or the U.S. Numerous columnists have been added, and now include the literary critic and essayist [[Igor Mandić]], leading web entrepreneur Nenad Bakic, actress and screenwriter [[Jelena Veljača]], editor-in-chief of [[Forbes]] Croatia, Viktor Vresnik and culinary expert Rene Bakalović.

''Nedjeljni'' also launched a weekly food supplement, ''Dobra Hrana'', with 10 pages of cooking tips and features on dining culture. The paid circulation figures have been increasing in recent months, and the title currently outsells the daily edition of ''Jutarnji''.

==Notable stories ==

In September 2010, ''Nedjeljni'' launched a series of investigative features on the Croatian meat industry, exposing the systematic failure of inspections and border controls.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jutarnji.hr/vara-se-na-analizama--uvozi-se-staro-meso--a-mesnice-imaju-katastrofalne-higijenske-uvjete/883580/&lt;/ref&gt; The series drew sharp criticism from government officials and industry leaders, but ''Jutarnji'' continued publishing until the government opened a hotline and launched a series of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jutarnji.hr/afera-meso--u-sest-dana-cak-300-prijava-na--mesofon-/889211/&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the paper published a shocking feature on the Croatian shadow economy, which by some estimates represents about 30% of the country's GDP.  The feature was widely cited and brought about a change in the legal system in order to battle shadow economy.

On its March 2, 2011 cover, the paper published an exclusive story on the corruption in the European parliament involving the Slovenian, Romanian and Austrian representatives. 

Also, on January 3, 2010, ''Nedjeljni'' published one of the first articles on Fimi-media, a company that was allegedly involved in a corruption scandal that led to the arrest of former Croatian Prime Minister [[Ivo Sanader]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.net.hr/crnakronika/page/2010/01/02/0173006.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|date=February 2014}}
The '''Night of the Dead''' is a whole night of [[horror film]]s shown as part of the annual [[Leeds International Film Festival]]. Beginning in 2001, it has become a firm fan favourite, selling out well before the event. Since Night of the Dead V, this event has taken place at the [[Hyde Park Picture House]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].

As well as the films there is plenty of banter between films between the "organisers" and the audience. There is the giving away of prizes either for doing, not doing or claiming to have done things that those running the event deem worthy. There is also often an appearance by somebody involved with the making of one of the films shown for a Q&amp;A session.

== Night of the Dead IV ==
This took place from midnight on 6 November 2004. The films shown were ''[[I'll See You in My Dreams (2003 film)|I'll See You In My Dreams]]'' (a short), ''[[Graveyard Alive: A Zombie Nurse in Love]]'', ''[[El Ciclo]]'' (another short), ''[[Monster Man (film)|Monster Man]]'', ''[[Una de zombis|Una de Zombis]]'' and ''[[Black Sunday (1960 film)|Black Sunday]]''. Night of the Dead IV was the last to take place at the Lounge Cinema.

== Night of the Dead V ==
Kicking off at midnight of 12 November 2005  with the short film ''[[The French Doors]]'', the event continued, alternating between long and short with ''[[Loft (2005 film)|Loft]]'', ''[[Jona/Tomberry]]'', ''[[Boy Eats Girl]]'' (starring [[Samantha Mumba]]), ''[[Something Red]]'', ''Zombie Honeymoon'', ''[[12 Hot Women]]'', and finally ''[[Gusha No Bindume]]'' (or "Hellavator").

==Night of the Dead VI ==
On the 11th (technically 12th) day of November in 2006, at the stroke of midnight began the sixth annual '''Night of the Dead'''.

'''Nikko Briteramos''' (born June 22, 1983 in [[Chicago, Illinois]] is a former [[Huron University]] basketball player convicted in 2002 for not informing his partner of his HIV status before having sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_14_102/ai_91915327/ | work=Jet | title=HIV positive college student sentenced for having unprotected sex with his girlfriend | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received national attention after he was the first person arrested under a South Dakota law requiring that persons inform prospective sexual partners that they are [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus|HIV]] positive. He became the central subject of wide-ranging ethical and philosophical debates regarding the unconstitutionality and illegitimacy of [[partner notification]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/01/us/after-arrest-campus-queues-for-hiv-tests.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=26 March 2011|title=After Arrest, Campus Queues for H.I.V.

In March 2002, he allegedly participated in a "Post 9-11" [[Red Cross]]" blood drive. Several weeks later he was informed by Red Cross officials that the donation that he gave was flagged for HIV.&lt;ref&gt;JET magazine Vol. 102, No. 14 ISSN 0021-5996, Published by Johnson Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;  

Briteramos admitted having unprotected sex with the woman in his dorm on April 13. The woman later tested negative for HIV. He was arrested after Health Department officials discovered Briteramos and the woman in his dorm room. He was initially charged with three counts of intentional exposure to the AIDS virus. Two counts were dropped in exchange for his guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_14_102/ai_91915327/ | work=Jet | title=HIV positive college student sentenced for having unprotected sex with his girlfriend | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He pled guilty to one count of "Intentional Exposure to HIV" and received a suspended sentence of five years, 120 days in jail, and 200 hours community service plus fines.  According to the plea deal he was to register for school where later found out that he had lost his scholarship.  He was eventually arrested for violating the terms of his probation for having spent five hours in the registration process and tested positive for marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keloland.com/NewsDetail6162.cfm?Id=20142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Notorious H.I.V.:the media spectacle of Nushawn Williams&lt;/ref&gt;  Briteramos spent 18 months in the South Dakota State Penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;VIBE magazine Jul 2003 Vol. 11, No. 7 ISSN 1070-4701 Published by Vibe Media Group&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his release from prison, the 6 foot-9 inch Briteramos played in 2005-06 for [[Chicago State University]].  He was not drafted by the NBA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://basketball.realgm.com/player/Nikko-Briteramos/Summary/13902&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pukllay''' or '''phukllay''' ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for to play, play / carnival,&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; other spellings ''pucllay, pugllay, phujllay, pujhllay, pujllay, puqhllay'') is a traditional festival held in the central [[Andes mountains|Andes]]. The word "play" refers to either the clouds or the blossoms "playing" in the winds at the end of the rainy season and thus harvesting time. The Bolivian ''Pukllay'' is connected to the Christian carnival and the celebration of a battle won over the Spaniards – hence the appropriation of the Spanish helmets and spurs one can still see in the ritual dance.

In March 2011, Bolivia nominated the ''Pukllay''  festival in [[Tarabuco]] (including the Ayarichi dance of the Yampara people) to UNESCO for [[World Heritage]] recognition as part of the cultural and intangible heritage of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bolivia postula tres expresiones culturales como patrimonio inmaterial ante la Unesco | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-04-07 | date = 2011-03-17 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/tragaluz/20110317/bolivia-postula-tres-expresiones-culturales-como-patrimonio-inmaterial_117403_233217.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140201213428/http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/tragaluz/20110317/bolivia-postula-tres-expresiones-culturales-como-patrimonio-inmaterial_117403_233217.html | archivedate = 2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reclaim the Streets''' ('''RTS''') is a collective with a shared ideal of [[community ownership]] of [[public space]]s. Participants characterise the collective as a [[resistance movement]] opposed to the dominance of [[corporation|corporate]] forces in [[globalisation]], and to the [[automobile|car]] as the dominant [[mode of transport]].

==Protests==
{{main|Street reclamation}}

Reclaim the Streets often stage [[non-violence|non-violent]] [[Civil disobedience|direct action]] [[street reclamation|street reclaiming]] events such as the 'invasion' of a major road, highway or freeway to stage a party. While this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as [[automobile|car]] drivers and public bus riders, the philosophy of RTS is that it is vehicle traffic, not pedestrians, who are causing the obstruction, and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space. The events are usually spectacular and colourful, with sand pits for children to play in, free food and music, however they have been known to degenerate into riots and violence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#KleinNoLogo|Klein]]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]] sometimes results. The style of the parties in many places has been influenced by the [[rave]] scene in the UK, with [[sound system (DJ)|sound systems]] playing dance music.

'''Reclaim the Streets''' is also used for this type of political action, regardless of its actual relation to the RTS movement.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2007}}
The earliest written source for the phenomenon "reclaim the streets" can be found in Marshall Berman's (1981) ''All That is Solid Melts into Air.'' In a chapter entitled "Modernity in the Streets" Berman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At the ragged edge of Baudelaire's imagination we glimpsed another potential modernism: revolutionary protest that transforms a multitude of urban solitudes into a people, and '''reclaims the city streets''' for human life. . . ''Thesis,'' a thesis asserted by urban people starting in 1789, all through the nineteenth century, and in the great revolutionary uprisings at the end of World War One: '''the streets belong to the people.''' ''Antithesis,'' and here is [[Le Corbusier]]'s great contribution: no streets, no People." (pp. 166–167, emphasis added)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Streets have many times been occupied with the intent of using them for other things than traffic. For example, a group of environmentalists occupied the streets of central Stockholm in autumn 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativstad.nu/Dokument/bilfriadan.html|title=Bilfria dan|website=www.alternativstad.nu|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in 1990–91 the same group arranged a tradition of 20 minutes "culture crashes" in busy street crossings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternativstad.nu/Dokument/kulturkrockarna.html|title=Kulturkrockarna|website=www.alternativstad.nu|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other occupations against car traffic before 1991, these events were not called Reclaim The Streets.

===United Kingdom===
Reclaim The Streets was originally formed by [[Earth First!]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} in [[Brixton]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}, London, in Autumn 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no6/rts.htm|title=Reclaim The Streets! (Do or Die)|website=www.eco-action.org|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was born out of anti-road protest camps at places such as [[M11 link road protest|Claremont Road]] and [[Twyford Down]]. The idea of street reclaiming soon spread throughout the United Kingdom. The first actions can be seen as specifically anti-car and pro-alternative transport, but over the years the members of the core group changed its focus, realising that it was better to go to the root of the problem as they saw it, namely the capitalist system.&lt;ref&gt;A direct action network for global and local social-ecological revolution(s) to transcend hierarchical and authoritarian society, (capitalism included), and still be home in time for tea... Welcome to the cyber-streets of RTSLondon. [http://rts.gn.apc.org/ Reclaim The Streets! website ]&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Our streets are as full of capitalism as of cars and the pollution of capitalism is much more insidious."''&lt;ref&gt;Reclaim The Streets Agit-Prop (Distributed at the M41 Street Party on Saturday 13 July 1996) quoted on [http://www.eco-action.org/dod/no6/rts.htm Do or Die Issue 6, Summer 1997. In the paper edition, this article appears on page(s) 1–10.]
&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the actions always followed the principle of [[non-violent direct action]].

===Global===
The idea of a Reclaim The Streets action was quickly taken up as a form of protest around the world. These "[[street party|street parties]]" have been held in cities all over Europe, Australia, North America, and Africa. Initial instances confounded authorities and drivers alike, but over the years the protests have become institutionalised in many places, occurring much like other forms of legal protest in that the event is arranged with authorities beforehand, but not in all places like for example in [[Finland]], where the first [[Street party]] outside the UK was arranged on 17 May 1997.

'''Refugees of the Syrian Civil War''' or '''Syrian refugees''' are citizens and permanent residents of [[Syrian Arab Republic]], who have fled from their country since the onset of the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2011 and have sought [[right of asylum|asylum]] in other parts of the world.

In 2016, from an estimated pre-war population of 22 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria's drained population| url= https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/09/daily-chart-18 |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations]] (UN) identified 13.5 million Syrians requiring [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] assistance, of which more than 6 million are [[Internally displaced person|internally displaced]] within Syria, and around 5 million are [[refugees]] outside of Syria.&lt;ref name="OCHA"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.unocha.org/syria|title = UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 16_02_2016 |date= |accessdate= |website = |publisher = |last = |first =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of the latter are hosted by countries neighboring Syria. Among countries of the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP), a coordination platform including neighboring countries (with the exception of Israel) and Egypt, the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)]] counted 5,165,502 registered refugees, as of August 2017.&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt;
[[Turkey]] is the largest host country of registered refugees with over 3.5 million Syrian refugees.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
The UNHCR counted almost 1 million asylum applicants in Europe, as of August 2017.&lt;ref name="europe"&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe: Syrian Asylum Applications |url=http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/asylum.php |publisher=UNHCR |date=June 2017 |accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Humanitarian aid]] to internally displaced persons (IDPs) within Syria and Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries is planned largely through the UNHCR.
By 2016, various nations had made pledges to the UNHCR to permanently resettle 170,000 registered refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unhcr.org/52b2febafc5.html|title = UNHCR Factsheet on resettlement: Syrian Refugees |date= 16 February 2016 |accessdate = 17 February 2016 |website= UNHCR |publisher= UNHCR |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404042206/http://www.unhcr.org/52b2febafc5.html |archivedate=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
{{main|Syrian Civil War}}
[[Human rights in Syria]] under the rule of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] (continuous since 1963) is considered to be in exceptionally poor conditions by international observers and has been deteriorating further since 2008.&lt;ref name="w.r.p555"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/world-report-2010 World Report 2010 Human Rights Watch World Report 2010], pg. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AmInt2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/syria|title=Amnesty International Report 2009, Syria|publisher=|accessdate=28 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007231314/http://thereport.amnesty.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/syria|archivedate=7 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2010-11 [[Arab Spring]] uprisings in [[Tunisia]], [[Egypt]], [[Libya]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Yemen]] inspired [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|major protests]] in Syria.
The Syrian Army intervened in March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13343540 |title=Syrian army tanks 'moving towards Hama' |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2011 |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Syrian government crackdown gradually increased in violence, escalating to major military operations to suppress resistance. In April, hundreds died in clashes between the Syrian Army and opposition forces, which included armed protestors and defected soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=219606|title=Civilian killings in Syrian demonstrations rises to 800|date=5 July 2011|newspaper=|work=The Jerusalem Post|via=|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As Syria descended into civil war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. has secretly provided arms training to Syria rebels since 2012 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/21/world/la-fg-cia-syria-20130622 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date= 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it quickly became divided into a complex patchwork of shifting alliances and territories between the Assad government, [[Syrian opposition|rebel groups]], the majority-Kurdish [[Syrian Democratic Forces|SDF]], and [[Salafi jihadist]] groups (including [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]).
Up to half a million people [[Casualties of the Syrian Civil War|died in the war]], including around a hundred thousand civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About 475 thousand persons were killed in 76 months of the Syrian revolution |url=http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=70012 |date=16 July 2017| accessdate=12 August 2017 |publisher=[[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights|SOHR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2011, thousands of people had fled from the war to neighbouring countries, with even larger numbers displaced within Syria itself.&lt;ref name="cnnwitnesses"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/05/14/syria.conflict/index.html?hpt=T2 |title=Witnesses: Soldiers shell Syrian border town amid refugee flight |publisher=CNN |date=14 May 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="syriasrefugees"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/05/13/syrias_refugees_from_terror |title=Syria's refugees from terror |first=Hanin |last=Ghaddar |publisher=Foreign Policy: The Middle East Channel |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="turkeypreparing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2011/05/03/turkey-preparing-for-large-numbers-of-syrian-refugees/ |title=Turkey preparing for large numbers of Syrian refugees |publisher=Ya Libnan |date=3 May 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As armies assaulted various locations and battled, entire villages were trying to escape, with thousands of refugees a day crossing borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/23/us-syria-idUSTRE75J0AV20110623 |title=Syrian troops near Turkey border, refugees flee |agency=Reuters |date= 23 June 2011|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=syriaturkeydenounce&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin |last=Chulov |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/09/syria-turkey-refugees-denounce-regime |title=Syrian refugees in Turkey: 'People see the regime is lying.

Other reasons for displacement in the region, often adding to the Syrian Civil War, target the refugees of the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War]], [[Kurdish refugees]], and [[Palestinian refugees]].

"The Syria crisis has become the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era, yet the world is failing to meet the needs of refugees and the countries hosting them", the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] [[António Guterres]] said in 2014.&lt;ref name="Syrian Refugees"&gt;{{cite news|title=Syrian refugees biggest humanitarian crisis|url=http://www.middleeaststar.com/index.php/sid/225225113|date=28 August 2014|accessdate=30 August 2014|publisher=''Middle East Star''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNHCR reported that the total number of refugees worldwide exceeds 50 million for the first time since [[World War II]], largely due to the Syrian civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Harriet Sherwood, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/20/global-refugee-figure-passes-50-million-unhcr-report Global refugee figure passes 50&amp;nbsp;m for first time since second world war], The Guardian, 20 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2012, in the [[early insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War]] preceding 10 April ceasefire under the [[Kofi Annan peace plan for Syria|Kofi Annan peace plan]],
UN reported 200,000 or more Syrians internally displaced, 55,000 registered refugees and an estimated 20,000 not yet registered.&lt;ref name="reuters2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-refugees-idUSBRE8390JE20120410 |accessdate=20 May 2017| title=Factbox: Syrian refugee exodus grows | publisher=Reuters|date=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 25,000 were registered in Turkey, 10,000 in Lebanon (mostly fleeing [[2012 Homs offensive|fighting in Homs]], around 10,000 more were unregistered), 7,000 in Jordan (with 2,000 more unregistered estimated by the UNHCR, 20,000 according to [[The Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development|JOHUD]] and 80,000 arrivals according to Jordanian officials&lt;ref name="news24"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/World/News/Syria-Refugees-brace-for-more-bloodshed-20120312 |title=Syria: Refugees brace for more bloodshed – News24|work=News24|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), 800 in Iraq (400 more unregistered).&lt;ref name="reuters2012" /&gt; Within Syria, there were 100,000 refugees from Iraq, 70,000 more already returned to Iraq.&lt;ref name="reuters2012" /&gt;

An estimated 1.5 million Syrians are refugees by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taheri|first1=Amir|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10803920.2013.822756#.VN6zOPmG_QA|title=Has the Time Come for Military Intervention in Syria?|journal=American Foreign Policy Interests|date=9 August 2013|volume=35|issue=4|pages=217–220|accessdate=18 November 2014|doi=10.1080/10803920.2013.822756}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014, the deteriorating humanitarian situation in neighboring Iraq prompted an influx of Iraqi refugees into north-eastern Syria. By the end of August, the UN estimated 6.5 million people had been displaced within Syria, while more than 3 million had fled to countries such as Lebanon (1.1 million), Jordan (600,000) and Turkey (800,000).&lt;ref name="Syrian Refugees" /&gt;

With the beginning of 2015, the European Union struggled to cope with the [[2015 European migrant crisis|migrant crisis]], its countries entering negotiations and heated political debate over closing or reinforcing borders and quota systems for resettlement of refugees and migrants from different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/55e9793b6.html|title=UNHCR chief issues key guidelines for dealing with Europe's refugee crisis|date=4 September 2015|publisher=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a drowned Syrian toddler's body washed up on a Turkish beach becomes [[Death of Alan Kurdi|a seminal moment]] in the refugee crises and global response.&lt;ref name="adamwithinall"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/if-these-extraordinarily-powerful-images-of-a-dead-syrian-child-washed-up-on-a-beach-don-t-change-10482757.html |title=If these extraordinarily powerful images of a dead Syrian child washed up on a beach don't change Europe's attitude to refugees, what will? |author=Adam Withnall |date=2 September 2015 |work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stopthewarcoalition"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/news/if-this-powerful-image-will-not-change-uk-attitudes-to-refugees-what-will |title=If this powerful image will not change UK attitudes to refugees, what will? |publisher=[[Stop the War Coalition]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; National debates and media coverage about the Syrian refugee crises increase markedly, bringing considerable attention to the human costs of the Syrian Civil War, the responsibilities of host countries, pressures forcing refugees to migrate from their host countries, people smuggling, and the responsibilities of third countries to resettle refugees.&lt;ref name="people smuggler"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2215315/alan-kurdis-father-was-working-as-a-human-smuggler-claims-fellow-refugee/ |title=Alan Kurdi's father was working as a human smuggler claims fellow refugee |publisher=[[Global News]] |date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="falsified claim"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34142695 |title=Canada denies Alan Kurdi's family applied for asylum |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the same year in [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Egypt]], the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) was launched to better coordinate humanitarian help between [[UNHCR]], governments and NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabstates.undp.org/content/rbas/en/home/ourwork/SyriaCrisis/projects/3rp.html|title=3RP: Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan|website=United Nations Development Programme in the Arab States|language=en|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, the countries hosting the largest numbers of refugees also introduced a number of restrictions on new arrivals.
Lebanon stopped new registrations and allows refugees to enter the country only in extreme circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30657003|title=Syrians entering Lebanon face new restrictions|date=5 January 2015|publisher=BBC News|access-date=28 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jordan sealed its border with Syria during most of 2016, because of security concerns over [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] control, according to government officials.&lt;ref name="freihat"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jordanian Chief of Staff Lieutenant Mahmoud Freihat: ISIS Controls Syrian Refugee Camps Near Jordanian Border|url=https://www.memri.org/tv/jordanian-chief-staff-lieut-gen-mahmoud-freihat-isis-controls-syrian-refugee-camps-near-jordanian/transcript|publisher=[[Middle East Media Research Institute|MEMRI]]|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jordantimes.com/news/local/6-troops-killed-14-injured-car-bomb-attack-syria-border?platform=hootsuite|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=21 June 2016|publisher=The Jordan Times|title=6 troops killed, 14 injured in car bomb attack on Syria border}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports from the [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]], the [[National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] emerged in 2016 that Turkish border guards routinely shoot at Syrian refugees trying to reach Turkey,&lt;ref name="hurriyet2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-foreign-ministry-rejects-claims-of-killings-on-syrian-border.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=100689&amp;NewsCatID=341|title=Turkish Foreign Ministry rejects claims of killings on Syrian border|publisher=hurriyet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyet"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-denies-using-force-against-syrian-refugees-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=99053&amp;NewsCatID=339|title=Turkey denies using force against Syrian refugees |publisher=hurriyet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/334866-turkish-guards-shoot-refugees/|title=Turkish border guards shooting Syrian refugees 'daily' – Amnesty Intl|publisher=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt; also, Turkey has forcibly returned thousands of Syrian refugees to war zone since mid-January 2016.&lt;ref name="https"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rt.com/news/338011-turkey-syria-refugees-amnesty/|title=Turkey forcibly returned thousands of Syrian refugees to war zone – Amnesty|publisher=RT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish Foreign Ministry and President Erdoğan denied it.&lt;ref name="hurriyet2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hurriyet"/&gt;

In 2017, while the conflict in Syria and the reasons for displacement continue, few Syrians are able to leave it, due to more restrictive border management by neighboring countries.&lt;ref name="3RPStrategic"&gt;{{cite report|author=UNHCR|author-link=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|date=December 2016|title=Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) – Regional Strategic Overview|url=http://www.3rpsyriacrisis.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/3RP-Regional-Strategic-Overview-2017-2018.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same period, an estimated 50,000 first time asylum applications have been made by Syrians in Europe,&lt;ref name="europe"/&gt; and around 100,000 new [[third country resettlement]]s are planned for 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=So, your country isn't keen to resettle refugees.

===Returns===
As of mid-2017, an estimated 260,000 refugees returned to Syria since 2015 and more than 440,000 internally displaced persons returned to their homes, to search for family, check on property and, in some cases, due to improved security in parts of the country.&lt;ref name="returns"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/briefing/2017/6/595612454/unhcr-seeing-significant-returns-internally-displaced-amid-syrias-continuing.html|title=UNHCR seeing significant returns of internally displaced amid Syria's continuing conflict|publisher=[[UNHRC]]|date=30 June 2017|accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="returnsIOM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Over 600,000 Displaced Syrians Returned Home in First 7 Months of 2017 |url=https://www.iom.int/news/over-600000-displaced-syrians-returned-home-first-7-months-2017 |publisher=[[International Organization for Migration|IOM]] |date=11 August 2017 |accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Walid Muallem|Syrian foreign minister]] called on the country's refugees to return home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian FM calls on refugees to return home|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-4171914/Syrian-FM-calls-refugees-return-home.html|website=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|accessdate=3 February 2017|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Moallem to Filippo Grandi: The government committed to providing needs to people and refugees|url=http://sana.sy/en/?p=67115|publisher=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] (SANA)|accessdate=3 February 2017|date=21 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, the UNHCR stated that conditions in Syria are still unsafe and destitute, improvements in many areas are uncertain and many basic services are absent; access of aid convoys is also a challenge.&lt;ref name="returns" /&gt;
Less than a half of the returnees have access to water or health services, due to extremely damaged infrastructure.
An estimated 10 per cent ended up as internally displaced persons once again.&lt;ref name="returnsIOM" /&gt;

===Overall situation===
{{Expand section|date=August 2017}}
The vast majority of refugees live below the poverty line
(e.g. in 2016 in Lebanon most households were below $85 monthly per capita;&lt;ref name="vasyr16"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees in Lebanon, 2016 |url=http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/download.php?id=12482 |publisher=UNHCR, UNICEF, WFP |date=16 December 2016 |accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
in south east Turkey, 90% were below $100 and 70% below $50 monthly per capita&lt;ref name="turkeyDebt16"&gt;{{cite web|title=MEB/SMEB Calculation for Syrians Living in Turkey - 2016 |url=https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/57031 |author=Christina Hobbs |publisher=UNHCR |date=September 2016| accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Average monthly per capita expenditures were estimated in 2015-2016 at $104 in Lebanon&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt; and $55 in south-east Turkey.&lt;ref name="turkeyDebt16" /&gt;
Underemployment and low wages are widespread. Many rely on less sustainable sources, food vouchers, taking credits or borrowing money mostly from friends and relatives, less frequently from shops and rarely from landlords
(e.g., in Lebanon 90% households were in debt, $850 in average;&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;
in south-east Turkey more than half are in debt, a few hundred dollars on average&lt;ref name="turkeyDebt16" /&gt;).
Because of this, refugees face difficulties accessing services and providing food, housing, healthcare and other basic needs for their families.&lt;ref name="unhcrUpdate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="3RPKey" /&gt;
Most refugees receive refugee-related information through SMS
(e.g. 91% of registered households in Lebanon&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;) and many use smartphones (in Lebanon, two thirds of households reported using [[Whatsapp]]&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;).

====Shelter====
Refugees live primarily within hosting communities, in rented houses or informal settlements of tents and sub-standard dwellings.
Only about 10% live in [[Syrian refugee camps|formal camps]].
In Lebanon, 85% pay rent, 71% live in residential building (regular apartments or in the micro-apartments designed for the building doorman/superintendent), 12% in non-residential structures (worksites, garages, shops), and 17% in informal tented settlements; a quarter of homes are overcrowded (less than 4.5 square meters per person).&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;
In southern Turkey, 96% of the refugees living outside of camps pay rent, 62% live in rented apartments, 28% in unfinished buildings or garages, 1% in tents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Security Report, Off-Camp Syrian Refugees in Turkey |url=https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/54523 |date=April 2016|accessdate=13 August 2017| publisher=[[World Food Programme|WFP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Refugees are commonly charged a higher rate compared to local people, especially for sub-standard conditions
(in 2016, in Lebanon, a monthly average ranging from $53 for keeping tents on land to $250 for a non-shared apartment or house;&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;
in south east Turkey, roughly $250 for dwellings meeting [[Sphere Project|SPHERE]] standards, excluding water and electricity costs&lt;ref name="turkeyDebt16" /&gt;).
In Lebanon, many households face water shortages and a quarter of dwellings were in notably poor condition.&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;

Few refugees have residency permits in Lebanon, mainly due to their cost, creating difficulties at checkpoints when moving in search for jobs.&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;

====Employment====
Earning opportunities for refugees are predominantly informal, principally due to governments issuing few working permits. Barriers include quotas, fees, long and cumbersome paperwork, and discrimination by employers.
In Turkey, even after reforms opening the labor market in January 2016, the number of refugees in a single workplace cannot exceed 10%; employers pay work permit fees of 600 [[Turkish lira|TL]] ($180) every year; while there is an exemption for seasonal work, it requires a separate application and still requires being registered for at least 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Syrian Nationals Working in Turkish Supply Chains: FAQ on Work Permits for Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection, Turkey |url=http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/download.php?id=12085 |author=Foreign Trade Association |date=February 2017 |accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By late 2015 at most several thousand permits have been issued, refugees are thus overwhelmingly employed informally.&lt;ref name="turkeyLabor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact of Syrian Refugees on Turkey Labour Market |url=https://data2.unhcr.org/en/documents/details/54522 |date=August 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2017| publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jobs are often seasonal and employment rates differ widely between winter and summer.&lt;ref name="turkeyDebt16" /&gt;
In May 2016 in Lebanon, 36% working-age individuals (70% men, 7% women) reported working (for at least one day in the 30 days prior to a survey). Among them underemployment was widespread (working 14 days a month on average) and wages were low (on average $215 for working men and $115 for working women).
The structure of employment was 33% construction, 22% agriculture, 26% services, 6% retail/shops, 6% cleaning.&lt;ref name="vasyr16" /&gt;

Some Syrian refugees have resorted to [[prostitution]] as a means of survival, particularly among women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadiki|first1=Larbi|title=Routledge Handbook of the Arab Spring: Rethinking Democratization|date=2014|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwarzer|first1=Beatrix|title=Transnational Social Work and Social Welfare|date=2016|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is increasing concern about the exploitation of female refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/syria-women-rape-marriage-refugee-camp-jordan|title=Rape and sham marriages: the fears of Syria's women refugees|work=Channel 4 News|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNHCR]] has a policy of helping refugees work and be productive, using their existing skills to meet their own needs and needs of the host country:
: Ensure the right of refugees to access work and other livelihood opportunities as they are available for nationals... Match programme interventions with corresponding levels of livelihood capacity (existing livelihood assets such as skills and past work experience) and needs identified in the refugee population, and the demands of the market... Assist refugees in becoming self-reliant. Cash/ food/rental assistance delivered through humanitarian agencies should be short-term and conditional and gradually lead to self-reliance activities as part of a longer-term development... Convene internal and external stakeholders around the results of livelihood assessments to jointly identify livelihood support opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Livelihoods and Self-reliance|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4eeb19f49.pdf|publisher=UNHCR, 2011|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internally displaced persons in Syria==
{{See also|Palestinian refugee camps}}

More than half the people fleeing the war moved only within Syria itself. While [[Refugee#Legal definition|legal definitions]] of "refugee" do not apply to them, they are often referred to as such. The term [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) is used to distinguish them, with "[[Forced displacement|(forcibly) displaced person]]" applying to both groups. UNHCR estimates that 7 million persons in Syria are internally displaced or in need of humanitarian assistance, as of 2017. Most live in houses, often badly damaged by the war.

Due to security concerns, poor access to areas of need and unpredictability, humanitarian efforts were directed at emergency aid. The complexity of administrative procedures and limited capacity of NGOs permitted to operate in Syria are also cited as challenges to assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Shelter Sector 2016 Year-End Report|url=https://www.sheltercluster.org/syria-hub/documents/syria-shelter-sector-2016-year-end-report|author=Sector partners providing urgent aid to the civilians of Aleppo|publisher=Maha Shaban|date=January 2017|access-date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelter aid for internally displaced persons is coordinated mainly by the [[Shelter Cluster|Global Shelter Cluster]] (co-led by [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|IFRC]] and the Syrian Ministry of Local Administration). No formal camps were set up, but some public buildings are rehabilitated as collective short-term shelters. For example, of the 90,000 people from east [[Aleppo]] registered by the UN, the vast majority live in houses, but 4,250 remain in the Jibreen collective shelter, as of January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/en/node/138151|title=Aleppo Situation Report No. 12|date=4 January 2017|access-date=1 May 2017|author=[[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|OCHA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More people are targeted by programs of help in upgrading private unfinished buildings and of winterization and shelter kit distribution (blankets, light construction materials, tools, etc.). Only since recently the situation allows for implementing more durable solutions: full, long-term rehabilitation of damaged houses to basic living conditions, light infrastructure repair and legal help. In 2016, collective shelters were rehabilitated for 24,000 persons, kits were distributed to 26,000 people, 40,000 benefited from private building upgrades, 12,000 from long-term house repairs, and 5,000 from basic infrastructure repair.

[[UNRWA]] estimates that 450,000 Palestinian refugees remain in Syria, of whom up to 280,000 are internally displaced, and an estimated 43,000 are trapped in hard-to-reach locations.
Some continue to be displaced multiple times as a result of armed violence. Additionally, 120,000 are displaced to neighboring countries.
Until 2011, UNRWA provided services in 12 camps administered by Syrian authorities, including [[Homs Camp|Homs]] and [[Yarmouk Camp|Yarmouk]]. Many sustained extensive damage and were forcibly displaced due to armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Escalation of violence in Syria claiming Palestine refugee lives and destroying civilian homes|url=https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/official-statements/escalation-violence-syria-claiming-palestine-refugee-lives-and|accessdate=1 May 2017|date=8 June 2016|publisher=[[UNRWA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Palestinian Authority|PA]] President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] contacted the UN Secretary-General about the situation, and the latter  tried to broker a deal with [[Israel]] to allow Palestinian refugees living in Syria to resettle in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]].

==In countries of the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan==
[[File:Zaatari refugee camp, Jordan (3).jpg|thumb|[[Zaatari refugee camp]], Jordan]]
[[File:Syrian refugees in the Middle East map en.svg|upright=1.364|thumbnail|Number of Syrian refugees hosted in countries under the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan. (August 2015)]]

The Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan (3RP) is a coordination effort between [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]] (countries neighboring Syria), [[Egypt]], and [[United Nations|UN]] agencies with [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] including [[UNHCR]] and 240 partners.&lt;ref name="3RPKey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3rpsyriacrisis.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/3RP-Interagency-Key-Messages.pdf |title=3RP Key Messages| date=March 2017| accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It describes itself as "a strategy document, coordination platform, advocacy tool, and funding appeal".
The 3RP has been initiated at the break of 2015/2016, replacing the former inter-agency Regional Response Plan and coordinating response plans of each country,
with  national leadership and ownership as a foundational principle, to use in-country systems effectively and avoid creating parallel ones.
It publishes strategic overviews and broad reports on the situation in constituent countries, describing in particular humanitarian efforts outside of Syria.
These are directed at food and assistance, safe water access, formal education for children, primary health care consultations, shelter assistance, and access to wage employment.
According to the 3RP, funding is not keeping up with needs of the region: only 6 percent of the 2017 Plan has been funded in the first three months, while the 2016 Plan has been funded at 63 percent.
The 3RP also called for support including commitments to resettlement.&lt;ref name="3RPKey" /&gt;

In the region, refugees predominantly live in urban, peri-urban and rural areas, while only about 10 percent live in camps.&lt;ref name="3RPStrategic" /&gt;
The majority live below the [[poverty threshold|poverty line]].
Hosting countries face overburdened infrastructure, both public (e.g., water, health, roads) and private (e.g., housing), as well as severe disruption of exports through Syria.

{{see also|Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Jordan|Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Egypt}}

'''{{flag|Egypt}}''' – [[Egypt]], which does not border [[Syria]], became a major destination for Syrian refugees since 2012 following the election of Egyptian President [[Mohamed Morsi]]. During Morsi's presidential term, they were an estimated between 70,000 and 100,000 Syrian refugees living in the country. Morsi's government tried to support Syrian refugees by offering residency permits, assistance on finding employment, allowing Syrian refugee children to register in state schools and access to other public services.

Following the events relating to the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état]], Syrian refugees were met with hostility by Egyptians, accusing them of supporting the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], since the group has close relations with the [[Syrian opposition]] and the [[Free Syrian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kenner|first1=David|title=Latest victims of Egypt's coup: 70,000 Syrian refugees|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/11/latest-victims-of-egypts-coup-70000-syrian-refugees/|publisher=[[Foreign Policy]]|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian refugees find hostility in Egypt|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-refugees-find-hostility-in-egypt/2013/09/07/fc54b832-17cc-11e3-961c-f22d3aaf19ab_story.html|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interim government has also tightened visa restrictions for Syrian citizens, requiring them to obtain a visa and a security clearance issuance before entering Egypt. Following these measures, at least 476 Syrians were denied entry or deported from Egypt. A number of flights carrying Syrians have been turned back from airports in Egypt to where their flight originated, including [[Damascus]] and [[Latakia]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt imposes new visa rules on Syrians|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/09/egypt-imposes-new-visa-rules-on-syrians.html|website=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]]|date=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/51f242c59.html|title=Egypt: UNHCR concerned over detention of Syrian refugees amid anti-Syrian sentiment|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–2014)|post-coup unrest in Egypt]], many Syrians have also made decisions to leave Egypt and settle in [[Europe]] instead.

As of March 2016, Egypt hosts 119,665 refugees, an increase of 1,153 refugees from April 2015.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UNHCR-Egypt"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/country.php?id=8|title = UNHCR Syria Regional Refugee Response/ Egypt|author = |date = 17 March 2015|work = [[UNHCR]]|accessdate = 21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study by Egyptian foreign affairs ministry has estimated that the country has hosted around 500,000 Syrian refugees since the start of the conflict. Egypt's assistant foreign minister Hisham Badr blamed the refugee influx over the [[EU-Turkey deal]] and Egypt hasn't received enough assistance from foreign governments to reduce the refugee influx, which he claims is currently costing the government around [[US$]]300 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Sarah|title=Egypt reveals it now hosts FIVE MILLION migrants – including 500,000 Syrians – and blames the influx on EU deal with Turkey.|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3766960/Egypt-reveals-hosts-FIVE-MILLION-migrants-including-500-000-Syrians-blames-influx-EU-deal-Turkey.html|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] has also said that his country received around 500,000 Syrian refugees without "media shows". President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi|al-Sisi]] said that his government doesn't abuse refugees, adding that many international organizations stopped receiving refugees, causing an increase in the numbers and that his government still receives refugees despite [[Egypt]] facing an economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2015/09/13/500000-syrian-refugees-were-received-in-egypt-al-sisi/|title=500,000 Syrian refugees were received in Egypt: Al-Sisi|date=13 September 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) and the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) reported that Syrian refugees have contributed US$800 million to the [[Economy of Egypt|Egyptian economy]] since the start of the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian refugees have contributed $800 mln to Egyptian economy since 2011: UN report|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/268891/Egypt/Politics-/Syrian-refugees-have-contributed--mln-to-Egyptian-.aspx|publisher=[[Ahram Online]]|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Turkish law, Syrian refugees cannot apply for resettlement but only temporary protection status. Registering for temporary protection status gives access to state services such as health and education, as well as the right to apply for a work permit in certain geographic areas and professions. Over a third of urban refugees are not registered. Currently, 30% of Syrian [[refugee children]] have access to education, 4,000 businesses have been opened, and several Syrian refugee camps have grown into small towns with amenities from healthcare to barber shops. Over 13 million Syrians received aid from the Turkish Aid Agency (AFAD).

With continuous refugees fleeing into their country, by 2018 Turkey has been reported in hosting 63.4% of all the refugees in the world.

Turkey continues to support the refugees by building around 28 shelters for the victims of human trafficking, however outside the camps, only 24% of Syrian children have access to education, work permits are still highly restricted, lack of systematic social benefits are becoming worse, and even border control has become more strict. Although 90% of the Syrian refugees in Turkey live outside the camps and inside the citites, and although Turkey holds the highest population rate in refugees as a whole, Turkey continues to struggle with the amount of responsibility they hold of the 3.5 million refugees.

=== President Barack Obama administration ===

In late September 2016, the U.S surpassed its initial goal of resettling 10,000 Syrian refugees by resettling over 12,500 refugees throughout the U.S. Most of this initial grouping were admitted to the U.S in the previous four months leading up to this announcement.

President Obama made a statement on 20 September 2016, asking countries at a United Nations Leader's Summit on Refugees to "fulfill a moral obligation" to help the current refugee crisis. He also rejected current President Trump's idea to build a wall on the border of Mexico and the United States.  His statement to help the millions of refugees around the world was stressed by his action to convene the summit. He brought up Syria in particular in his speech mentioning the 4.8 million refugees from Syria was "particularly unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Koran |first=Laura |date=20 September 2016 |title= Obama: Refugee crisis is test of our humanity |url= http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/20/politics/obama-refugees-summit/index.html |website= CNN.com |location=New York, NY, USA |accessdate= 6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama stated in his summit speech that the refugee crisis is so bad that most refugees are leaving with hardly more than the clothes on their backs.

=== President Donald Trump administration ===

On 27 January 2017, new US President [[Donald Trump]] announced that he had signed [[Executive Order 13769|an executive order]] suspending any further resettlement of Syrian refugees to the [[United States]] indefinitely until further notice due to security concerns (excluding "refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality"&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html |title=Executive Order Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United State |date=27 January 2017 |work= New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could include [[Christians in Syria|Christians]], [[Shia Muslims]] and [[Yazidis]] in Syria).

It was also announced in April of that same year that the US would send $167 million for Lebanese support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Held |first=Amy |date= 25 July 2017 |title= Trump Says Keeping Syrian Refugees in Region is 'Best Way To Help Most People'|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/25/539318758/trump-says-keeping-syrian-refugees-in-region-is-best-way-to-help-most-people |agency= National Public Radio |location= Washington, DC, USA |accessdate= 6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some supports advocate that Donald Trump's new suspension of resettlement was done to help protect the safety of the [[United States]], a large portion are skeptical of the long-term results of the suspension. According to opponents of the plan, the suspension can be described as "ill-conceived, poorly implemented and ill-explained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chappell |first=Bill |date= 6 February 2017 |title= Former Top Security Officials Criticize Trump's Ill-conceived'Ban in Court Fling |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/06/513683537/former-top-security-officials-criticize-trumps-ill-conceived-ban-in-court-filing |agency= National Public Radio |location= Washington, DC, USA |accessdate= 6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of critics even includes two prominent Republicans, [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] and [[John E. McLaughlin|John McLaughlin]]. The critics argue that, since 11 September 2001, there have been no terrorist attacks in the U.S. that have been caused by any of the people banned by the order. In addition, they say that the suspension could compromise U.S. troops fighting overseas and that it provides propaganda for terrorist organizations like ISIS, as it allows them to proclaim that the U.S. has anti-Islam tendencies. The U.S. 9th Circuit Cout of Appeals has said in ''[[Washington v. Trump]]'', that the travel ban is not constitutional, but Trump has stated he will continue to try and make it a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trump Travel Ban Makes America Less Safe: Ex-Top Security, State Officials|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-travel-ban-makes-america-less-safe-ex-top-security-n717206|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=14 February 2017|date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 December, the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of supporting the Trump Administrations third installment of the travel ban. This decision will allow full enforcement of the ban to continue after US courts blocked the first two measures of the controversial regulation of travelers. The ban will allow the Trump administration to heavily regulate migration from countries such as Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Venezuela, Yemen and Syria. This comes after President Trump's loss in October from his second ban being blocked by federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii. Active cases against the ban are currently in the lower courts and could dictate if President Trump's third attempt at his travel ban could still be enforced or deemed unconstitutional like his original two efforts. Advocates against the ban include the American Civil Liberties Union which represent several groups challenging the ban and will continue to do so with American Civil Liberties Union's director Omar Jadwat saying "President Trump's anti-Muslim prejudice is no secret." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= 4 December 2017 |title= Supreme Court Allows Trump Travel Ban to Take Effect |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/us/politics/trump-travel-ban-supreme-court.html|newspaper= New York Times|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2016 Fiscal Year, the US dramatically increased the number of refugees admitted from Syria, totaling 12,587 refugees from the war-torn country. Ninety-nine percent of these refugees were Muslims (with few Shia Muslims admitted) and approximately one percent were Christian according to the Pew Research Center analysis of State Department Refugee Processing Center data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=State Department refugee data|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/05/u-s-admits-record-number-of-muslim-refugees-in-2016/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious breakdown of Syria's 17.2 million people is approximately 74% Sunni Islam, 13% Alawi, Ismaili and Shia Islam, 10% Christian and 3% Druze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CIA Factbook|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of religious persecution in the country is described by the [[State Department]], "In Syria, the Assad regime increased its targeting and surveillance of members of a variety of faith groups it deemed a "threat," especially members of the country's Sunni majority. This occurred concurrently with the escalation of violent extremist activity targeted against religious minorities, including [[Christians]], [[Druze]], [[Alawites]], and others as the current civil war continues. Large scale internal and external displacement of all sectors of the population is ongoing"  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580e4274e58c624696efadc6/t/583c731337c5810ef266008f/1480356628934/Report+to+Congress+for+FY+2016+USRAP.pdf |title=Proposed Refugee Admissions for FY 2016, Report to Congress  |date= |work= US Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the US accepted 3,024 Syrian refugees, but only accepted 11 in the first quarter of 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/04/12/602022877/the-u-s-has-welcomed-only-11-syrian-refugees-this-year |date= |work= NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public opinion on Syrian refugees ===

The topic of American's involvement in alleviating the Syrian refugee crisis continues to be a highly contentious issue among legislators, stakeholders, and activists. As instability in the region continues to rise, and the number of people seeking refuge continues to increase, the topic of whether or not to admit Syrian refugees into the United States continues to have a pervasive hold on American affairs, both foreign and domestic.

The issue of whether or not to admit Syrian refugees into the US has long been classified as a partisan issue, and the poll results affirm this position. As of 2016, 56% of Democrats support admitting Syrian refugees into the US, whereas 18% of Republicans are supportive, and 32% of Independents supportive of admitting Syrian refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/press-release/poll-most-americans-oppose-admitting-syrian-refugees-favor-limited-military|title=Poll: Most Americans Oppose Admitting Syrian Refugees, Favor Limited Military Involvement to Combat ISIS in Syria {{!}} Chicago Council on Global Affairs|last=Affairs|first=Chicago Council on Global|website=www.thechicagocouncil.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Syrian Refugee Crisis, the [[United States]] citizens have been formulating opinions on how to deal with the refugee crisis. In a CNN/ORC poll conducted in November 2015 when responding to the question "Do you favor or oppose allowing refugees from Syria to seek asylum in the United States? ... Do you favor/oppose that strongly or just somewhat?" 16% of people were strongly in favor, 22% somewhat in favor, 18% somewhat opposed, 43% strongly opposed, and 1% were unsure.&lt;ref name="Immigration"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pollingreport.com/immigration.htm|title=Immigration|website=www.pollingreport.com|access-date=2018-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poll indicates that towards the beginning of the Refugee Crisis people were more so in opposition of Syrian refugees taking asylum in the United States. This poll was conducted again in 2017, January 31 through February 2, responding to the same question. In this poll, 25% of people were strongly in favor, 29% somewhat in favor, 18% somewhat opposed, 27% strongly opposed, and 2% were unsure with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.&lt;ref name="Immigration"/&gt; This poll indicates that Americans are pretty split on the issue of letting Syrian refugees into the United States in 2017 and that more people changed their opinions from 2015 to be more in favor of letting in Syrian refugees.

In [[Duke University School of Law|Duke University Law School]]'s Academic Journal, Suman Momin wrote an article entitled ''A Human Rights Based Approach to Refugees: A Look at the Syrian Refugee Crisis and Responses from Germany and the United States''. Momin lays out the most common moral and intrinsic arguments that affect citizens' opinions on refugee issues such as the Syrian Refugee Crisis. Momin introduces the "Good Samaritan" argument, the protection argument, and the political responsibility argument.&lt;ref name="Momin 2017 55–79"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Momin|first=Suman|date=2017|title=A HUMAN RIGHTS BASED APPROACH TO REFUGEES: A LOOK AT THE SYRIAN REFUGEE CRISIS AND THE RESPONSES FROM GERMANY AND THE UNITED STATES|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1066&amp;context=dflsc|journal=Duke Forum for Law &amp; Social Change|volume=9|pages=55–79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]] argument states that people are in favor of helping non-citizens who are refugees as long as they believe that by helping, their own country will not be sacrificing anything. The protection argument stems from the idea that humans care about the rights and lives of others. This argument means that people pay attention to emotional debates that use photos of refugees or play at emotional connections, making people want to protect or save refugees. Finally, the political responsibility argument states that people are more willing to help when they think providing aid or letting in refugees with advance their own country politically. Where Americans stand on these moral rationales is what influences their opinion of foreign policy issues towards Syrian refugees.&lt;ref name="Momin 2017 55–79"/&gt;

In a [[Quinnipiac University]] Poll from February 16 through February 21, 2016, responding to the question "Do you support or oppose accepting Syrian refugees into the U.S.?", 74% of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 43% of [[Independent voting movement|Independents]] were in support of Syrian refugees coming to the US while only 13% of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were in support. 82% of Republicans were opposed to Syrian refugees coming to the US, 51% of Independents and 22% of Democrats. 4% to 5% of people in each party had no answer. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9.&lt;ref name="Immigration"/&gt; This poll indicates that Democrats are largely in favor of Syrian refugees entering the US while Republicans are largely opposed and considering the margin of error, Independents are completely split on the issue. In another poll taken by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] in January 30 and 31st of 2017 Gallup asked people "Thinking now about some of the specific actions [[Donald Trump]] has taken since he has been in office, would you say you approve or disapprove of indefinitely suspending the United States' Syrian refugee program" 32% of people approved Trumps actions suspending the Syrian refugee program 62% of people disapproved and 6% of people were unsure. There was a margin of error of plus or minus 4 in this poll.&lt;ref name="Immigration"/&gt; These public opinion polls show how American opinions change and how they would respond to questions concerning Syrian refugees.

In [[Culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman culture]], '''''sigillaria''''' were [[ancient Roman pottery|pottery]] or wax figurines given as traditional gifts during the [[Saturnalia]]. Sigillaria as a [[proper noun]] was also the name for the last day of the Saturnalia, December 23,&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Kaster, ''Macrobius: Saturnalia Books 1–2'' ([[Loeb Classical Library]], 2011), pp. 81 (note 110) and 110 (note 178).&lt;/ref&gt; and for a place where ''sigillaria'' were sold.&lt;ref&gt;[[Caroline Vout]], ''Power and Eroticism in Imperial Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; A '''''sigillarius''''' was a person who made and sold ''sigillaria'', perhaps as an offshoot of [[Terra sigillata|pottery manufacture]].&lt;ref&gt;Claire Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome: The Retail Trade in the Late Republic and the Principate'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The objects==
In the dialogue of [[Macrobius]]'s ''Saturnalia'', the interlocutor Praetextatus says that ''sigillaria'' were substitutes for the sacrificial victims of the primitive religious rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.10.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreted as such, they raise questions about [[human sacrifice]] among the earliest Romans&lt;ref&gt;Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Argei]] and [[oscilla]]). The speaker Evangelus, however, counters that the figures are nothing more than toys to amuse children.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' 1.11.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fair==
For the four-day fair, vendors of the figurines and other gifts set up temporary stalls in the [[Campus Martius]], and later in the [[portico]] of the [[Baths of Trajan]]. [[Juvenal]] says the vendor stalls blocked the paintings of [[Jason (mythology)|Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the [[Porticus Argonautarum|Porticus Agrippiana]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast to [[Juvenal]] 6.154; Lawrence Richardson, ''A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1992), p. 398; Holleran, ''Shopping in Ancient Rome,'' pp. 191–192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dolf Brouwers.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dolf Brouwers as Sjef van Oekel.]]

'''Sjef van Oekel''' was a popular TV comedy character created by Dutch artist [[Wim T. Schippers]] and played by Dutch comedian, singer and actor [[Dolf Brouwers]] (1912–1997). Van Oekel started as a side character in ''[[De Fred Hachéshow]]'' in 1972, but became such a cult figure that he gained his own television show, ''[[Van Oekel's Discohoek]]'', songs and even a comic strip, all written by Schippers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Dolf_Brouwers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==

[[Wim T. Schippers]] created Sjef van Oekel in 1972 as a Belgian [[french fries]] salesman from the village [[Reet]]. Schippers had never visited Reet, but had seen the name on a company manufacturing car accessories and enjoyed the [[double entendre]] of the name ("Reet" means "crack" or "buttcrack" in Dutch).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Dolf_Brouwers&lt;/ref&gt; In line with his character's origin Van Oekel originally used a Flemish accent, but quickly dropped this in favor for his own Dutch accent.

Van Oekel is typically dressed in a fine black [[tuxedo]] and always talks and behaves in a refined manner, complete with [[archaism]]s. However something always went wrong during his presentations, either on the set or he himself tripped or went [[nauseous]]. Situations like these always lead to his well-known [[catch phrase]]: "Ik word niet goed!" ("I'm starting to feel not well!"). Whenever Van Oekel said this he usually used a handkerchief to clean off the sweat on his forehead. In one controversial episode he threw up in the bicycle bag of his sidekick Evert van de Pik (played by Jaap Bar), which outraged Dutch journalist [[Henk van der Meyden]] so much that he started an unsuccessful campaign to get the program banned. Other well-known catch phrases of Van Oekel were "Als het ware..." ("As a matter...") and "Pardon...reeds" ("Pardon... already").

==History==
The character made his debut in 1972, in ''[[De Fred Hachéshow]]'', a controversial television show created by [[Wim T. Schippers]]. He later returned in two later Schippers shows, ''[[Barend is weer bezig]]'' (1972–1973) and ''[[Van Oekel's Discohoek]]'' (1974).&lt;ref name="franken"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlfilmdoek.nl/artikelen/algemeen/wim-t-schippers-3-het-is-weer-zo-laat/|title=Wim T. Schippers #3: Het is weer zo laat!|last=Franken|first=Guido|date=17 July 2008|publisher=Nederlands Filmdoek|language=Dutch|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The van Oekel character was ancillary in ''De Fred Hachéshow'' and ''Barend is weer bezig'', both of which had Barend Servet as the lead, but central in ''Van Oekel's Discohoek'', where he played the host of a music show on television that parodied popular music programs of the era.

Van Oekel quickly became a [[cult figure]] with viewers. Brouwers recorded many Schippers-penned and other songs, most of which comic and dramatic. With [[Manke Nelis]] he recorded "Vis wordt duur betaald" (#46 in the Dutch charts in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Manke+Nelis+%26+Dolf+Brouwers&amp;titel=De+vis+wordt+duur+betaald&amp;cat=s|title=Manke Nelis &amp; Dolf Brouwers – 'De vis wordt duur betaald'|publisher=dutchcharts.nl|accessdate=27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), but his best known song is probably "Vette jus" ("[Sauerkraut with] greasy gravy"), a dish still associated with him in a song that is little more than a list of Dutch dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.destentor.nl/regio/raalte/zuurkool-met-vette-jus-in-olst-1.2601005|title=Zuurkool met vette jus in Olst|date=26 November 2007|work=[[De Stentor]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/zuid-holland/nieuws/rotterdam/2005/juli/doe-jij-het-op-muziek-met-kito.html|title=Doe jij het op muziek, met Kito|last=Baken|first=Janneke|date=29 July 2005|publisher=[[3VOOR12]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.parool.nl/parool/nl/34/ETEN-DRINKEN/article/detail/233632/2009/03/28/Johannes-van-Dam-blikt-terug.dhtml|title=Johannes van Dam blikt terug|date=28 March 2009|work=[[Het Parool]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was first performed on the 1973 Christmas special for ''[[Barend is weer bezig]]''; it was written by Schippers, [[Gied Jaspars]], and [[Clous van Mechelen]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|last1=Schippers|first1=Wim T.|authorlink1=Wim T. Schippers|last2=Jaspars|first2=Gied|authorlink2=Gied Jaspars|last3=Hemert|first3=Ruud van|authorlink3=Ruud van Hemert|last4=Linden|first4=Wim van der|authorlink4=Wim van der Linden|title=Het Barend Servet effect.

==Comic strip==
In 1976 [[Wim T. Schippers]] and [[Theo van den Boogaard]] drew a [[celebrity comics|celebrity comic strip]] series based on the character. Many stories and gags feature Van Oekel embarrassing other people or meeting rather eccentric and exhibitionistic people himself. Sjef van Oekel quickly became notorious for featuring very risqué subject matter, including religion, pornography, [[pedophilia]], prostitution, vulgar language, and so on. The stories were published in ''De Nieuwe Revu'' and sold well enough to be translated in French ("Léon Van Oukel", later "Léon La Terreur"), German ("Julius Patzenhofer", later "Leo, der Terrorist"), Danish and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/boogaard.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brouwers' personal backlash==
Van Oekel made a few media appearances in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but by 1984 this came to a halt too. Brouwers felt increasingly exploited by Schippers, especially regarding the comic strip. In 1989 he dragged Schippers and Van den Boogaard to court because the comic strip frequently portrayed him in vulgar situations without him earning a penny from it. The judge ruled in favor of Brouwers and decided that the series could continue, but the character was no longer allowed to be portrayed in "obscene or pornographic situations". A financial settlement was also agreed on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Dolf_Brouwers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lambiek.net/artists/b/boogaard.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether van Oekel was just used or also abused by Schippers and others was the topic of a 2004 theater production. According to Hein Janssen, writing in ''[[de Volkskrant]]'', it is certainly true that Brouwers jumped at the opportunity to become a celebrity, but the extent to which Schippers and the other writers and directors pushed Brouwers (he balked, for instance, at having to simulate sex with an inflatable doll) is questionable.&lt;ref name="janssen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2676/Cultuur/article/detail/694765/2004/10/06/Zuurkool-met-vette-jus-gloedvol-vertolkt.dhtml|title="Zuurkool met vette jus" gloedvol vertolkt|last=Janssen|first=Hein|date=6 October 2004|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Team Racing Auto Circuit''' (TRAC) was a proposed American [[stock car]] [[automobile racing]] organization founded by Hank Durschlag and [[Charles Jeter]] that was scheduled to begin operations in 2004. TRAC was proposed by a group called Team Sports and Entertainment Inc., whose shareholders included [[Cale Yarborough]], a three-time winner of the [[NASCAR]] [[Winston Cup Series]] season title, [[television]] executive [[Robert Wussler]]; and former [[college football]] coach [[Danny Ford]]. Among the series' board members includes former Cup team owner [[Michael Kranefuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=20010516&amp;id=wboeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_s8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6217,4934923|title=New racing series revved up for 2003|newspaper=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]]|date=May 16, 2001|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Miller was named chief executive officer of Team Sports Entertainment Inc. and its subsidiary, the Charlotte-based Team Racing Auto Circuit.  Miller is the chairman of Miller Industries Inc., a provider of vehicle towing and recovery equipment and services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2002/01/21/daily13.html Charlotte Business Journal] January 22, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The concept of TRAC was to put teams of drivers, particularly 8–12 two-driver teams,&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/may/16/sports/sp-64203|title=New Racing Series Set for 2003|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 16, 2001|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in identically prepared cars that were said to be similar to the [[muscle cars]] produced by [[Automotive industry|Detroit]].  Some of the cars that were scheduled to compete included the [[Chevrolet Corvette]], the [[Dodge Viper]], and the [[Ford Mustang]]. All entries were to be equipped with [[Riley &amp; Scott]]-designed chassis and fuel-injected V8 engines supplied and sealed (to prevent tampering) by a designated vendor. The [[race track]]s planned were primarily [[oval track racing|ovals]] with capacities of at least 50,000 people.&lt;ref name="LA Times" /&gt;

Teams, representing various tracks throughout the country, would accumulate points in each race for each driver, presumably based on the order of finish. The plan called for regular season races, playoffs, and a championship.

TRAC had a contract from [[ESPN]] to televise the races.  [[Raycom Media]] handled marketing and sold advertising, and Yarborough was the league's spokesman.

The series held a test at [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] in April 2002 with [[Andy Hillenburg]] and [[Tony Ave]] driving the cars. Four months later, at [[Lowe's Motor Speedway]], Ave and [[Boris Said]] tested the cars.&lt;ref name="Jayski" /&gt;

==Fall==
TRAC was unable to sell sponsorships for any of the proposed teams, prompting the series' debut to be postponed to 2004, but the league ultimately folded without conducting a single race.  The end of TRAC was officially announced on August 26, 2003.&lt;ref name="Jayski" /&gt;

In 2004, Team Sports and Entertainment was sued by four shareholders for "breach of contract, wrongful conversion of company monies, mismanagement, breach of fiduciary duty and fraud."&lt;ref name="Jayski"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayski.com/pages/trac.htm|title=TRAC Series Info|work=[[Jayski's Silly Season Site]]|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show''''' is an American half-hour animated series of the famous [[Abbott and Costello|comedy duo]] that aired in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] from September 9, 1967 to June 1, 1968.  Each of the 39 individual episodes consisted of four five-minute cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace, Vincent  (2009).  ''Encyclopedia of Television Shows, 1925 through 2007'' (Volume 1).  Jefferson, North Carolina:  McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-3305-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoons were created jointly by [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[RKO General]] and Jomar Productions between 1965 and 1967.  The series was syndicated by Gold Key Entertainment and [[King World Productions]], with the rights now owned by [[Warner Bros. Television Distribution]].

The primary feature of this cartoon series was the fact that [[Bud Abbott]] supplied the voice for his own character.  Stan Irwin provided the voice of [[Lou Costello]], who had died in 1959. The rest of the voice cast was composed of Hanna-Barbera regulars. The Canadian cartoonist, [[Lynn Johnston]], who is famous for her [[comic strip]], ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', was an uncredited cel colorist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=Lynn|title=A Look Inside For Better Or For Worse:: The 10th Anniversary Collection|year=1989|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|pages=38–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''Abbott and Costello'' was among the animated programs of the 1960s that were based on the decade's nostalgia craze which animated other comedy teams of the past such as ''[[Laurel and Hardy (animated series)|Laurel and Hardy]]'' and ''[[The New Three Stooges]]''.&lt;ref name="Erickson54" /&gt; The show created work for the ill and impoverished [[Bud Abbott]], who provided the voice of his animated character.&lt;ref name="Erickson54" /&gt; Lou Costello had died in 1959, and his voice was supplied by nightclub manager Stan Irwin, who was a close friend of the duo.&lt;ref name="Erickson54" /&gt;

==Comic book series==
A comic book based on the TV show was produced by [[Charlton Comics]].  Starting in February 1968, it ran for 22 issues, ending in August 1971.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?seriesid=11342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Hal Erickson (author)|Hal Erickson]], author of ''Television Cartoon Shows, An Illustrated Encyclopedia'' gave the program a negative review, stating that  ''Abbott and Costello'' episodes were difficult to tell apart.&lt;ref name="Erickson54"&gt;Erickson, 2005. p.54&lt;/ref&gt; Erickson stated that "virtually every one them features the tubby Costello being pursued by some bugeyed monster or giant sized garden pest" and that "None of the classic verbal exchanges which brought the real Abbott and Costello to fame in the first place are evident."&lt;ref name="Erickson54" /&gt;

==Home media==
An episode of the show was released in May 2013 as part of ''The Best of Warner Bros.: Hanna Barbera 25 Cartoon Collection'' DVD set.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cartoonbrew.com/dvd/warner-bros-anniversary-dvd-set-salutes-hanna-barbera-76903.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Théâtre de Paris''' is a theatre located at 15, rue Blanche in the [[9th arrondissement of Paris|9th arrondissement]] of Paris. It includes a second smaller venue, the '''Petit Théâtre de Paris'''.

==History==
The first theatre on the site was built by the [[Armand de Vignerot du Plessis|Duke of Richelieu]] in 1730. Baron Ogny bought it in 1779 and renamed it '''Folie-Richelieu'''. Then during the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] it was directed by Fortunée Hamelin, a celebrated member of the ''Merveilleuses'' ("marvelous women") of the [[French Directory|Directoire]] era.

In 1811, the Folie-Richelieu was transformed into a park, then demolished completely in 1851 in the redevelopment under [[Baron Haussmann]]. It became the site of the church of [[Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris|Sainte-Trinité de Paris]] with part of the site becoming a [[roller skating]] rink. In 1880, using plans by the architects Aimé Sauffroy and Ferdinand Grémailly, part of the rink became the Palace Théâtre and, after a further restoration in 1891 by [[Édouard Niermans (architect)|Édouard Niermans]], the [[Casino de Paris]]. After that, the rest of the rink, near the present rue Blanche, was demolished to make way for the '''Nouveau-Théâtre'''.

The first director of the Nouveau-Théâtre, actor and stage director [[Lugné-Poe]], an associate of [[André Antoine]], introduced the Norwegian [[Henrik Ibsen]] and the Swedish [[August Strindberg]] to Parisian audiences, before leaving to found the [[Théâtre de l'Œuvre]] in 1893.

In 1906, the actress [[Gabrielle Réjane]] bought the theater, renovated it and gave it a new name, the '''Théâtre Réjane'''. She produced among other works the French premiere of ''[[The Blue Bird (play)|L'oiseau bleu]]'' by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]] in 1911 and successfully played her signature role of ''[[Madame Sans-Gêne (play)|Madame Sans-Gêne]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]] at the theatre.

The producer Léon Volterra bought the hall in 1918, and on 12 August 1919, he inaugurated the '''Théâtre de Paris''', Réjane having stipulated in the sales contract that the theater could not retain her name. Volterra ran the theatre until 1948, when it was taken over by Marcel Karsenty and the comedian [[Pierre Dux]]. The actress and director [[Elvira Popescu]] took over in 1955 along with Hubert de Mallet, managing it for ten years, before she left to the [[Théâtre Marigny]].

Under Alain de Leseleuc (1965–1975) and Robert Hossein (1975–1990) the theatre specialized in musical works, particularly [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] [[List of operettas by Jacques Offenbach|operetta]]s and [[opéra-bouffe|opéras-bouffes]], such as ''[[La Périchole]]'' directed by Maurice Lehmann, ''[[La belle Hélène]]'' directed by [[Jérôme Savary]], and ''[[Le pont des soupirs]]'' directed by [[Jean-Michel Ribes]]. It also produced musicals like ''[[Starmania (musical)|Starmania]]'' and ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''.

Since January 2002, Stéphane Hillel has been artistic director of both theatres.

==Petit Théâtre de Paris==
Elvira Popescu created a second venue with 300 seats, converted from costume workshops, which she first called the '''Théâtre Moderne''' before renaming it the '''Petit Théâtre de Paris'''. This second theatre is still functioning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">'''Udo of [[Aachen]]''' (c.1200–1270) is a fictional [[monk]], a creation of British technical writer Ray Girvan, who introduced him in an [[April Fool's]] hoax article in 1999. According to the article, Udo was an illustrator and theologian who discovered the [[Mandelbrot set]] some 700 years before [[Benoît Mandelbrot]].

Additional details of the hoax include the rediscovery of Udo's works by the also-fictional Bob Schipke, a [[Harvard University|Harvard]] mathematician, who supposedly saw a picture of the Mandelbrot set in an [[illumination (manuscript)|illumination]] for a 13th-century [[Carol (music)|carol]]. Girvan also attributed Udo as a mystic and poet whose poetry was set to music by [[Carl Orff]] with the haunting ''[[O Fortuna]]'' in [[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]].

==Aspects of the hoax==

The poetry of ''O Fortuna'' was actually the work of itinerant [[goliard]]s, found in the German Benedictine monastery of [[Benediktbeuern Abbey]].

The hoax was lent an air of credibility because often [[medieval monks]] did discover scientific and mathematical theories, only to have them hidden or shelved due to persecution or simply ignored because publication prior to the invention of the printing press was difficult at best. Mr. Girvan adds to this suggestion by associating Udo with several other more legitimate discoveries where an author was considered ahead of his time in terms of a scientific theory of some sort that is now established as a mainstream theory but was considered [[fringe science]] at the time.

Another aspect of the deception was that it was very common for pre-20th century mathematicians to spend incredible amounts of time on hand calculations such as a [[logarithm table]] or [[trigonometric functions]]. Calculating all of the points for a Mandelbrot set is a comparable activity that would seem tedious today but would be routine for people of the time.

A '''referendum on the Act of Declaration of Independence''' was held in [[Ukraine]] on 1 December 1991.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', page 1976 {{ISBN|9783832956097}}&lt;/ref&gt; An overwhelming majority of 92.3% of voters approved the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declaration of independence]] made by the [[Verkhovna Rada]] on 24 August 1991.

==The referendum==
Voters were asked "Do you support the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]]?"&lt;ref name=N2&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1985&lt;/ref&gt; The text of the Declaration was included as a preamble to the question. The referendum was called by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Parliament of Ukraine]] to confirm the Act of Independence, which was adopted by the Parliament on 24 August 1991.&lt;ref name=UKrW191991&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/359102.shtml Historic vote for independence], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (1 September 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens of Ukraine expressed overwhelming support for independence. In the referendum, 31,891,742 registered voters (or 84.18% of the electorate) took part, and among them 28,804,071 (or 92.3%) voted ''"Yes"''.&lt;ref name=N2/&gt;

On the same day, a [[Ukrainian presidential election, 1991|presidential election]] took place.  All six candidates campaigned in favour of a "Yes" vote in the independence referendum.   [[Leonid Kravchuk]], the [[Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada|parliament chairman]] and de facto head of state, was elected to serve as the first [[President of Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=UKrW812991&gt;[http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1991/499101.shtml Independence – over 90% vote yes in referendum; Kravchuk elected president of Ukraine], ''[[The Ukrainian Weekly]]'' (8 December 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker takes out all his money from the bank where Audrey works, and he and Audrey eventually date and finally move in together. While Walker is attending a baseball game with his dog Brute, a man observes that Brute is a breed well-suited to fighting. Walker will not let his dog fight. Then Lou Ann insists on going to nursing school, which will cost a great deal of money, and she expects Walker to pay or he will never see his kids again. So Walker does what he has to do. Brute is very good, but Walker is reluctant to keep fighting. However, he needs the money and continues until Brute is killed and he gets arrested for dogfighting.

[[File:Posts in Warneford Meadow 030207.JPG|thumb|upright|Two wooden posts in Warneford Meadow.]]
'''Warneford Meadow''' is an area of {{convert|20|acre|ha}} of natural [[grassland]] immediately south-east of the [[Warneford Hospital]], in [[Headington]], east [[Oxford]], England. The Warneford Meadow is a wild space within urban Oxford. The area has been used by local residents as a [[public space]] for [[recreation]] for over 50 years.&lt;ref name="Town Green"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.24dash.com/news/environment/2006-12-21-Warneford-Meadow-to-become-Town-Green | title=Warneford Meadow to become Town Green? | date=21 December 2006 | publisher=24dash.com | accessdate=7 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Warneford Meadow was purchased in 1918 by the [[Warneford Hospital]], a [[psychiatric hospital]], following the sale of the adjacent Southfield Farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.headington.org.uk/history/listed_buildings/warneford.htm Headington News website describing the history of Warneford Hospital].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theoxfordtimes.net/display.var.1093753.0.nhs_dilutes_its_student_village_plan.php  |title=NHS dilutes its 'student village' plan |work=Oxford Times|date=29 December 2006 |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase was funded by public subscription, with the aim of providing natural green space for the psychological benefit of patients and the local community. [[Archaeology trench|Archaeological trenching]] performed in 2006 suggested a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] or [[Prehistoric Britain|pre-Roman settlement]], or area of [[pottery]] production, in the area of the present meadow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxford.gov.uk/files/meetingdocs/60257/item4-pt1.pdf An Oxford City council planning document (pdf) discussing the archeological findings].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Warneford meadow Tom Capon 1.jpg|thumb|Warneford Meadow in summer.]]
Access to the Meadow is gained from either a lane off Hill Top Road, beside the Southfield Park Golf Club, or Roosevelt Drive opposite the 'Little Oxford' housing development (beside the Headington Care Home). The Meadow slopes gradually down from the Hill Top Road end, towards the Boundary Brook, which runs between the Meadow and the [[Churchill Hospital]] to the East. Several public paths run across the Meadow. South of the Meadow is the Southfield Park Golf Club and the Meadow is bounded to the west by homes on Hill Top Road. Warneford Meadow also includes an orchard, on the northern border of the Meadow with the [[Warneford Hospital]].

==Biodiversity==
The Meadow contains species of [[butterfly]], [[invertebrates]], and birds including [[skylark]]s and [[kingfishers]]. The Meadow forms part of the 'green corridor' which links South Park to the [[Thames]] via Boundary Brook.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The Meadow's border hedges include [[Blackberry|backberries]]. The Warneford Orchard on the northern edge of the Meadow is over 50 years old and has varieties of apple including the Russian ''Emperor Alexander''.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} [[Owls]], [[bat]]s, and [[badgers]] are also found in the orchard.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Development==
[[File:Sunrise over Warneford Meadow 030207.JPG|thumb|Sunrise over the Warneford Meadow in winter.]]
Development of the Meadow is permitted under the Oxford Local Plan 2001–2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxford.gov.uk/PageRender/decP/Oxford_Local_Plan_occw.htm Oxford Local Plan 2001–2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oxfordshire &amp; Buckinghamshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust]] (OBMH) submitted two outline planning applications in July 2006, regarding the Meadow. The primary reason for the development, stated by the OBMH management, was the desire to generate capital for the Trust, in order to upgrade patient facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.obmh.nhs.uk/?p=1858 |title=Update on planning applications |work=Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust |date=20 November 2007 |accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In answer to a parliamentary question about the assets of the United Kingdom's [[National Health Service|NHS]] as a whole [[Liam Byrne]], the [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], revealed that the 'surplus' land at the Warneford Hospital was worth £30,900,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2006-01-12c.36306.h Theyworkforyou.com] – Liam Byrne MP clarifying the most valuable assets owned by the Department of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.headington.org.uk/news/items/2006/warneford_meadow.htm Headington News website with details of the planning proposals submitted to Oxford County Council], 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plans for development met with substantial opposition from local residents, led by nearby Residents Associations and the action group 'Friends of Warneford Meadow'.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

An application to have the land registered as a [[Village green|Town or Village Green]] (under section 22 of the [[Commons Registration Act 1965]], amended by section 98 of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/issues/common/town-villagegreens/index.htm UK government/DEFRA website outlining legislation on Town or Village greens]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in December 2006.&lt;ref name="Town Green"/&gt; The application was successful, and Warneford Meadow was designated as a Town Green in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7986428.stm Meadow Protected From Developers], [[BBC News]], 6 April 2009. Retrieved 23 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust challenged the decision in the High Court;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/search/4424678.NHS_to_appeal_on_Oxford_meadow_being_a__town_green_/ NHS to appeal on Oxford meadow being a "town green"], ''[[Oxford Mail]]'', 8 June 2009. Retrieved 23 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the action commenced in February 2010. In March 2010 the High Court upheld the original decision to register the meadow as a Town Green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/headlines/5081069.Meadow_campaigners_celebrate_a_new_dawn/ |title=Meadow campaigners celebrate a new dawn |date=24 March 2010 |work=Oxford Mail | accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wars in Lombardy''' were a series of conflicts  between the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Duchy of Milan]]  and their respective allies, fought in four campaigns in a struggle for hegemony in Northern Italy that ravaged the economy of [[Lombardy]] and weakened the power of  Venice.  They lasted from 1423 until the signing of the [[Treaty of Lodi]] in 1454. 
During their course, the political structure of Italy was transformed: out of a competitive congeries of [[Medieval commune|communes]] and [[Italian city-states|city-states]]  emerged the five major Italian territorial powers that would make up the map of Italy for the remainder of the 15th century and the beginning of the [[Italian Wars]] at the turn of the 16th century. They were Venice, Milan, [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], the [[Papal States]] and [[kingdom of Naples|Naples]].
Important cultural centers of Tuscany and Northern Italy&amp;mdash;[[Siena]], [[Pisa]], [[Urbino]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]]&amp;mdash;became politically marginalized.

The wars, which were both a result and cause of Venetian involvement in the power politics of mainland Italy,{{efn|Venice subdued [[Verona]] in 1402, [[Padua]] in 1405, and the rest of eastern Lombardy, the Venetian ''terra ferma'' ("mainland"), the following year. Previously Venice had been strictly a maritime power: her battles with the [[Republic of Genoa]], culminating in the [[battle of Chioggia]], were all fought at sea.}} found Venetian territory extended to the banks of the [[Adda River|Adda]] and involved the rest of Italy in shifting alliances but only minor skirmishing. 
The shifting counterweight in the balance was the allegiance of  Florence, at first allied with Venice against encroachments by [[House of Visconti|Visconti Milan]], then switching to ally with [[Francesco Sforza]] against the increasing territorial threat of Venice. 
The Peace of Lodi, concluded in 1454, brought forty years of comparative peace to Northern Italy,{{efn|See however the brief [[War of Ferrara]] (1482–1484) that was settled by the [[Peace of Bagnolo]].}} as Venetian conflicts focused elsewhere.{{efn|The extension of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] power into the [[Balkans]] and in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] had involved Venice in intermittent warfare since 1415.}}

After the [[Treaty of Lodi]], there was a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] resulting in a period of stability lasting for 40 years. During this time, there was a mutual pledge of non-aggression between the five Italian powers, sometimes known as the [[Italic League]]. Even there was frequent tension between Milan and Naples, the peace held remarkably well until the outbreak of the [[Italian Wars]] in 1494, as Milan called upon the king of France to press his claim on the kingdom of Naples.

==First campaign==
The first of four campaigns against the territorial ambitions of [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[duke of Milan]], was connected to the death of the lord of [[Forlì]], [[Giorgio Ordelaffi]]. He had named Visconti the trustee of his nine-year-old heir, [[Teobaldo II Ordelaffi|Teobaldo II]]. The latter's mother, [[Lucrezia degli Alidosi]], daughter of the lord of [[Imola]], did not agree and assumed the regency for herself. The Forlivesi rebelled and called in the city the Milanese [[House of Visconti|Visconti]]'s condottiero, [[Agnolo della Pergola]] (May 14, 1423). Florence reacted by declaring war on Visconti. Its captain [[Pandolfo III Malatesta|Pandolfo Malatesta]] therefore entered Romagna to help the Alidosi of Imola, but he was defeated and the city stormed on February 14, 1424. The young [[Luigi degli Alidosi]] was sent captive to Milan and a few days later the lord of [[Faenza]], [[Guidantonio Manfredi]], joined the Visconti party. The Florentine army, this time commanded by [[Carlo I Malatesta|Carlo Malatesta]], was again defeated, at the [[Battle of Zagonara]] in July; Carlo, taken prisoner, was freed by Visconti and joined him too. Florence thus hired [[Niccolò Piccinino]] and [[Oddo da Montone]], but the two were also beaten in [[Val di Lamone]]. Oddo was killed but Piccinino was able to convince Manfredi to declare war against Visconti.

After the failure in Romagna, Florence tried to defy the Visconti from the [[Liguria]]n side, by allying with the Aragonese of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]. However, both a fleet of 24 Aragonese galleys sent to Genoa to move it to fight against the Milanese, and a land army, were unsuccessful. In the meantime, Piccinino and the other condottiero [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]] had been hired by Visconti, who also sent an army to invade Tuscany under [[Guido Torello]]. He subsequently defeated the Florentine army at Anghiari and Faggiuola.

The Florentine disaster was countered by the pact signed on December 4, 1425 with the [[Republic of Venice]]. By the agreement the war was to be pursued at the common expense of both: the conquests in Lombardy to be assigned to the Venetians; those in Romagna and Tuscany to the Florentines. The condottiero [[Francesco Bussone da Carmagnola|Carmagnola]] was appointed Captain General of the League. In the ensuing fighting seasons (1425–26), Carmagnola, recently in the pay of Visconti, retook [[Brescia]], which he had recently taken on behalf of Visconti, after a long siege which saw massive use of artillery (November 26, 1426). Meanwhile, the Venetian fleet on the [[Po River]], under [[Francesco Bembo]], advanced as far as [[Padua]], and the Florentines regained all their lands in Tuscany. Visconti, who had already ceded Forlì and Imola to the [[Pope Martin V|Pope]] to gain his favour, called a mediation. Through the intervention of the Papal legate, [[Niccolò degli Albergati]], the peace was signed on December 30, 1426 in Venice.

Visconti regained the lands occupied by Florence in Liguria, but had to renounce the area of [[Vercelli]], conquered by [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy]], and Brescia, which went to Venice, and to promise to stop encroaching himself in Romagna and Tuscany.

==Second campaign==
The peace did not last very long. Under advice by the emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], Visconti refused to ratify it and the war broke out in May 1427. The Milanese were initially victorious, taking [[Casalmaggiore]] and besieging [[Brescello]]; the fleet sent there was set on fire by the Venetian fleet of Bembo; however, [[Niccolò Piccinino]] was able to defeat Carmagnola at Gottolengo on May 29. The Venetian commander pushed him back and conquered Casalmaggiore on July 12, while [[Orlando Pallavicino]], lord of several castles near [[Parma]], rebelled against the Visconti as Amadeus VIII and [[John Jacob of Montferrat]] invaded Lombardy from East.

Visconti could count on some of the best condottieri of the time, such as Sforza, della Pergola, Piccinino and [[Guido Torello]]. In order to counter their mutual jealousy, he named supreme commander Carlo Malatesta. The latter led the Milanese at [[Battle of Maclodio|Maclodio]] (October 4, 1427), being crushed by the Venetians under Carmagnola. The victory was however indecisive, and Visconti managed to be reconciled with Amadeus by ceding him [[Vercelli]] and marrying his daughter, [[Marie of Savoy (1411–1469)|Marie of Savoy]]. However, as Sforza was defeated by some Genoese exiled and Sigismund's help was wanting, Visconti sued for a treaty. With the mediation of the Pope, the peace was signed at Ferrara on April 18, 1428. A Venetian governor was established at [[Bergamo]] and [[Crema, Italy|Crema]] (1429) in addition to confirming the Venetian possession of Brescia and its ''contado'' (neighbourhood). The Florentines recovered the strongholds they had lost, apart from [[Volterra]], which rebelled against the new settlement. The troops sent to reduce that city, under [[Niccolò Fortebraccio]], were later sent to invade the [[Lucca]], whose lord, [[Paolo Guinigi]], had previously sided with the Visconti.

==Third campaign==
The third war (1431-1433) started, therefore, when Visconti took up the Lucchese cause, by sending them [[Francesco Sforza]], with 3,000 horse; Sforza, however, was eventually bought off with fifty thousand ducats by the Florentines, who continued the siege of Lucca after the condottiero had left. Called in by the besieged, Visconti managed to have the [[Republic of Genoa]] {{efn|Milan controlled Genoa since 1421.}} declare war against Florence. The subsequent defeat on the [[Serchio]] banks of their commander Guidantonio da Montefeltro (December 2, 1430), encouraged the Florentines to engage the aid of Venice once more and re-erect their lapsed League, with the favour of the new Pope, [[Eugene IV]], a Venetian. Visconti replied by rehiring Piccinino and Sforza, who were again to face Carmagnola.

The League's army was first beaten at [[battle of Soncino|Soncino]] (May 17, 1431), while [[Luigi Colonna]] defeated the Venetians at [[Cremona]], Cristoforo Lavello pushed back the Montferrat troops, and Piccinino established strong positions in Tuscany. Another source of dismay for the revived League was the [[Battle on the Po (1431)|destruction of the Po Fleet]] under [[Niccolò Trevisani]] near Pavia (June 23). In 1431 Visconti also found a precious ally in Amadeus VIII of Savoy in exchange for his help against John Jacob of Montferrat.

Venice won a naval victory over Genoa at [[San Fruttuoso]] on 27 August 1431, but on land  Carmagnola, the commander of Venetian forces, moved cautiously, avoiding a pitched battle and raising the suspicion he could have been bought by Visconti, while the latter was also joined by Sigismund who had entered Italy to receive the imperial crown. In the end Carmagnola was suspended; recalled by the [[Council of Ten]], he was arrested in March 1432, tried for treason and beheaded outside the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]]. In November 1432 a Venetian army was crushed by Piccinino at the [[Battle of Delebio]] by a joint army of Milan and [[Valtellina]], which had been invaded by the Serenissima in 1431.

The peace of Ferrara in May 1433 institutionalized an unsteady status quo. The Florentine war with Lucca and her allies likewise resulted in a return to the previous status quo, but the major League leader's lack of successes had lost much charisma: the Venetian doge [[Francesco Foscari]] was on the verge of resigning, while [[Cosimo de' Medici]] was imprisoned and confined in Padua. Another result of the peace agreement was the reduction of [[Montferrat]] to a satellite of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]].

==Fourth campaign==
In the so-called "fourth war" broader questions were personalized in the combats among antagonistic [[Condottiero|condottieri]]: [[Gattamelata]], and later [[Francesco Sforza]] fought nominally for Venice, while the Visconti side was led by [[Niccolò Piccinino]], who had promised to Eugene IV to reconquer the Marche for him. But, in a reversal typical of the time, when he captured [[Ravenna]] and [[Bologna]], he forced the cities to recognize Milanese suzerainty.

Piccinino, backed by [[Gian Francesco Gonzaga]], had invaded the Lombard possessions of Venice. In September 1438 he laid siege to Brescia and assaulted [[Bergamo]] and [[Verona]]. In response to this Venice signed an alliance with Florence and Francesco Sforza, including some notable captains of the time such as [[Astorre II Manfredi]], [[Pietro Persaliano]] and [[Niccolò III d'Este|Niccolò III of Ferrara]], who was also restored the [[Polesine]] in exchange for his support.

The Milanese were repeatedly defeated in Tuscany and at [[battle of Soncino|Soncino]] (June 14, 1440). The war seemed won for Venice, and Sforza went to Venice to receive the honour of a triumph. However, Piccinino returned from Romagna in February 1441 and crushed Sforza's garrison at Chiari. Sforza besieged [[Martinengo (Italy)|Martinengo]], but when Piccinino cut him off from any possibility of retreat the situation looked again favourable to Milan. Believing that the victory was now in his hands, he asked from Visconti the signiory of [[Piacenza]] in exchange for it. The lord of Milan preferred instead to appeal to Sforza for an agreement.

On the field of Cavriana, Sforza acted as mediator between the two sides, accomplishing the act for which Carmagnola had lost his head. No large territorial changes were made in the ensuing Peace of Cremona of 20 November 1441: Venice kept Ravenna, Florence the [[Casentino]]. Piccinino was awarded the lands of Orlando Pallavicino in the Parmense, while Filippo Maria Visconti recognized the independence of Genoa and again promised to stop interfering with the situation in Tuscany and Romagna.

==Aftermath==
Off the battlefields, important dynastic and political changes occurred: Francesco Sforza entered the service of Visconti and married his daughter, [[Bianca Maria Visconti]], while Florence took a new turn under [[Cosimo de' Medici]]. After Visconti died in 1447, Francesco Sforza, backed by Lorenzo de' Medici, entered Milan in triumph (May 1450).{{efn|After the demise of the short-lived [[Ambrosian Republic]].}} Two coalitions now formed: Sforza's Milan allied with Medici's Florence on the one hand, faced Venice and the Aragonese [[Kingdom of Naples]] on the other. The main theater of war remained Lombardy, where both sides joined in the [[Peace of Lodi]] (May 1454), a compromise peace that formed the basis for a general accord among the four contenders, Venice, Milan, Florence and Naples, under the blessings of [[Pope Nicholas V]], representing the fifth power in Italy. The peace of Lodi is often marked as the emergence of a consciously expressed European political principle of [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].
