'''20 ans, barakat!''' (20 years is enough!) is a movement in [[France]] and [[Algeria]] founded in 2003 to overturn the [[Algerian Family Code]] in force since June 1984.

They consider this code to contradict the legal equality between women and men proclaimed in Article 29 of the [[Constitution of Algeria|Algerian constitution]], institutionalizing what they call second-class citizenship for women and leading to discrimination and injustices against them.

Among the injustices and discrimination against women in the Algerian law the movement points to the following points:
* Polygamy is allowed.
* Only divorced women have parental authority over their children.
* Women's right to divorce is conditional, while men retain the power to divorce even against the will of the woman.
* Having a [[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|wali]] (matrimonial guardian) has been made optional, but has not been abolished.
* Negotiated conditions in the marriage contract are only available to the most educated and informed of women.

In response, the movement demands that the following changes be made to the Family Code:
* Prohibition of polygamy.
* End of the use of wali (matrimonial guardian).
* Introduction of joint parental authority.
* Introduction of equal rights to divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weldd.org/our-voices/algeria-statement-collectif-20-ans-barakat-20-years-enough|title=Algeria: Statement from the Collectif 20 ans barakat (20 Years is Enough!)|accessdate=22 November 2016|website=weldd.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022122/http://www.weldd.org/our-voices/algeria-statement-collectif-20-ans-barakat-20-years-enough|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] announced that it would support the establishment of as many as 50 overseas "economic and trade cooperation zones". Of the 19 zones approved so far, five are in Sub-Saharan Africa, namely [[Ethiopia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Nigeria]] (two), and [[Zambia]].

'''''Alfacinha''''' is a term to denote a person from [[Lisbon]], the [[etymology]] of which is unclear. The first known reference arises in the mid-19th century, in the book ''Travels in My Land'' by  [[Almeida Garrett]] (1846), "For you shall be ''Alfacinhas'' forever, supposing that all the squares of this world are like the Palace Square ...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Travels in My Land | year=1846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one explanation, the term comes from the fact that in the region of Lisbon [[lettuce]] (alface) is an abundant plant, and given the [[Arabic]] origin of the word, has been cultivated on a large scale during the [[Muslim]] period.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The '''Allgemeines bürgerliches Gesetzbuch''' ('''ABGB''') is the [[Civil Code]] of [[Austria]], which was enacted in 1811 after about 40 years of preparatory works. Karl Anton Freiherr von Martini and Franz von Zeiller were the leading drafters at the earlier and later stages of the draft. Comparable to the [[Napoleonic code]], it was based on the ideals of freedom and equality before the law. It was divided into three major segments, following the [[Roman law]] segregation methods. It was modernized during the [[First World War]]. ABGB continues to be the basic civil code of [[Austria]] to this day and it is also still the basic civil code of [[Liechtenstein]]. Besides Austria, its influence persists in other successor states of [[Austria-Hungary]]. In the Czech part of [[Czechoslovakia]] (The Slovak part used Hungarian customary law) it was in effect until 1951, although it had been [[Novation|novelized]] multiple times, until it was replaced by the civil code from 1950.

The '''Arthur Ross Book Award''' is a [[politics]]-related [[literary award]].

==History and administration==
It was endowed in 2001 by [[Arthur Ross (philanthropist)|Arthur Ross]], an American [[businessman]] and [[philanthropist]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Martin (journalist)|Martin, Douglas]] (September 11, 2007).

Retrieved February 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of recognizing books that make an outstanding contribution to the understanding of [[foreign policy]] or [[international relations]]. The prize is for nonfiction works from the past two years, in English or translation, and is accompanied by a monetary award. The amount of the prize has varied from year to year but has sometimes consisted of a $30,000 "Gold Medal", a $15,000 "Silver Medal" and a $7,500 "Honorable Mention".

The '''Association of Peasant Workers of the Carare''' (Spanish: ''Asociación de Trabajadores Campesinos del Carare'' (ATCC)) is an organization that was founded in 1987 in the village of La India, part of the municipality of [[Cimitarra]] in north-east Colombia, as a reaction to the ongoing violence between various armed groups in the region. Despite the murder of several of its leaders, it has continued to fight for peace, and in 1990 it was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] in recognition of its work.

== History ==
Following decades of fighting in the region between guerrilla groups and the Colombian army, later joined in the 1980s by paramilitary fighters, the community of La India had reached breaking point by 1987. A group of peasants asked for a meeting with the guerrillas  which took place on May 21, 1987, and asked to be left in peace. The guerrillas accepted the request of the group, and a meeting the following week with the commander of the military forces achieved the same result.&lt;ref name="Semana19910107"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=El premio de la paz |url=http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/el-premio-de-la-paz/14431-3 |magazine=[[Semana (magazine)|Semana]] |language=Spanish |date=January 7, 1991 |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the meetings the ATCC was formed. Its aim was to promote economic growth and peace in the region by holding talks with all parties involved in the conflict, while avoiding taking sides. The ATCC obtained a government grant for six million pesos to build a community store and two purchase two canoes to provide transport to the area along the [[Carare River]]. The organization also developed a six-year plan, cosing almost three thousand million pesos, to develop the region.&lt;ref name="Semana19910107" /&gt; The ATCC's plan covers six municipalities in the region and has five goals: to create a program of building a culture of peace and symbolic reparation; a health care and community rehabilitation plan; an agroforestry program to restore the environment and work for the community; a program of organizational strengthening and institutional recovery; and the restoration of collective property. The plan was finally approved on December 15, 2012.&lt;ref name="Espectador20130612"&gt;{{cite news |first=Santiago |last=Martínez Hernández |title=Reparación a la lucha sin armas |url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/judicial/reparacion-lucha-sin-armas-articulo-427476 |newspaper=[[El Espectador]] |language=Spanish |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATCC's greatest setback was the murder on February 26, 1990 of its co-founder and president Josué Vargas, its secretary Saúl Castañeda, and its technical advisor Miguel Ángel Barajas, along with London-based [[BBC]] journalist Silvia Duzán who had been interviewing them in a restaurant in Cimitarra.&lt;ref name="Espectador20130612" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiempo19901021"&gt;{{cite news |first=Arturo |last=Jaimes |title=Un Nobel hecho entre fusiles |url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-1287 |newspaper=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]] |language=Spanish |date=October 21, 1990 |accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on October 8 of the same year the organization was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] (popularly known as the "Alternative Nobel Prize") in recognition of its work in standing up to the violence.&lt;ref name="Semana19910107" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tiempo19901021" /&gt;

During the 1990s the ATCC was involved in a struggle to convince local farmers not to accede to the demands of guerrilla groups and plant coca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Oliver |last=Kaplan |title=Resisting War: How Communities Protect Themselves |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |page=191 |date=2017 |isbn=978-1-10715-980-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2001 and 2004 the organization also had to stand up to further outbreaks of violence that took place in the area.&lt;ref name="Espectador20130612" /&gt;

'''''Basarabia''''' was the first [[Romanian language]] newspaper to be published in [[Bessarabia in the Russian Empire|Bessarabian guberniya]] of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1906-1907.

==History==
[[File:May 1931, celebrating 25 years since the launch Basarabia, the first Romanian newspaper.jpg|thumb|left|In May 1931 the founders and employees of Basarabia celebrated 25 years since the launch]]

It was written with the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]] and published twice weekly. Labeling itself a "national-democratic gazette", the newspaper asked within its articles for [[land reform]], autonomy and self-government for [[Bessarabia]] and the usage of Moldovan in schools and administration. It published articles by [[Constantin Stere]], [[Ion Inculeţ]], [[Ion Pelivan]], [[Alexei Mateevici]], and [[Pan Halippa]].&lt;ref name="king29"&gt;*Charles King, ''The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the Politics of Culture'', 2000, Hoover Institution Press. {{ISBN|0-8179-9791-1}}, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1907, the newspaper published the Romanian patriotic song "[[Deşteaptă-te, române!]]" ("Awaken thee, Romanian!"), which prompted the governor, [[Alexei Kharuzin]], to order its closure. The Russian noble families and the Russian Orthodox Church began a campaign of purging Romanian nationalists from the church and cultural institutions. Many of the supporters of the newspaper were forced to flee to [[Iaşi]], in [[Romania]], where Stere helped them to become students at [[University of Iaşi]].&lt;ref name="king29"/&gt;

A more moderate attempt to continue ''Basarabia'''s work began in 1907, a publication named ''[[Viaţa Basarabiei, 1907|Viaţa Basarabiei]]'' led by [[Alexis Nour]], written in two versions: with Romanian Latin and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] alphabets, but after just six issues (April 22 - May 25, 1907), it also ceased its publication.&lt;ref name="king29"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Rusnac]], [http://www.istoria.md/articol/464/Rena%C5%9Fterea_cultural_na%C5%A3ional%C4%83_a_Basarabiei_%C3%AEn_perioada_%C5%A2arist%C4%83 Renaşterea cultural-naţională a Basarabiei în perioada Ţaristă]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campino e cavaleiro.jpg|thumb|A campino on horseback]]
A '''campino''' ({{IPA-pt|kɐ̃ˈpinu|lang}}) is a [[cattle]] [[herder]] in the [[portugal|Portuguese]] region of [[Ribatejo Province|Ribatejo]].

Campinos work on horse-back, using a long pole (a ''pampilho'' or [[lance]]) to manage and direct the herd.

Campinos are also known for their distinctive attire, which consists of a green and red stocking cap with a tassel, white shirt with full sleeves, red vest, short dark trousers and white stockings. This is similar to the traditional attire of the ''[[forcado]]'', the difference being mainly in the colours.

The '''Catholic Church in Angola''' is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] in [[Rome]]. Approximately 56% (9,486,960)&lt;ref&gt;[[Demography of Angola#Religions]]&lt;/ref&gt; of the population profess the Catholic faith, due largely to [[Angola]]'s status as a former [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony.

There are 19 dioceses, including 5 archdioceses. All the [[bishop]]s are members of the regional [[Episcopal Conference of Angola and São Tomé]].

==By country==

==={{flagu|China, People's Republic of}}===
{{Main|Time in China}}

=== {{flagu|Egypt}} ===
{{Main|Egypt Standard Time|Daylight saving time in Egypt}}

The British first instituted [[summer time]] in Egypt in 1940, during the [[Second World War]]. The practice was stopped after 1945, but resumed 12 years later, in 1957.&lt;ref name="wapo2016" /&gt;

Before the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|revolution in January 2011]], the government was planning to take a decision to abolish summer time in 2011 before President [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s term expires in September 2011. The [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|transitional government]] did so on 20 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/407168 |title=Egypt to cancel daylight saving time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the pretext that daylight saving time would save energy, the Egyptian government decided on 7 May 2014 to reinstate summer time with an exception for the holy month of [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=dst2&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/101285.aspx |title=Daylight saving to be applied in Egypt starting Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April the next year, a poll was held on whether to apply summer time or not. Following the results, the government decided on 20 April to temporarily cancel summer time, to make the necessary amendment to the laws and asked the ministers to work on a study to determine the probability of applying DST in coming years or not.&lt;ref name=dst1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/128195/Egypt/Politics-/No-daylight-saving-this-summer-Egypts-prime-minist.aspx |title=No daylight saving this summer: Egypt's prime minister}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministry of electricity assured that the achieved electricity savings from applying summer time is not of any tangible effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.egynews.net/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AC%D8%A6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A/ |title=Council of Ministers Postpones Using Summer Time This Year}} {{link language|ar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer time was expected to return in 2016, starting on July 8 (after [[Ramadan]]), but on July 5, it was decided to again cancel it.&lt;ref name="wapo2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/06/egypt-cancelled-daylight-savings-time-three-days-before-it-was-due-to-start/ |title=Egypt canceled daylight saving time three days before it was due to start |first=Adam |last=Taylor |date=July 6, 2016 |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''demiurge''' was a [[magistrate]] in [[Peloponnese|Peloponnesian]] and other [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[city-state|city-states]], including [[Corinth]], [[Mantinea]] and [[Argos]], and in their colonies, such as the Doric colony of [[Knidos|Cnidus]] in [[Asia Minor]]. The English word for the title is an [[Anglicisation]] of [[Attic-Ionic]] '''δημιοργός''', but because it was most commonly used by Doric Greek speakers, the original word in Greek has various alternate spellings (see below).

In the [[Achaean League]], the assembly of members was presided over by ten elected ''demiourgoi''; Corinth sent ''epidemiourgoi'' annually to [[Potidaea]] to report to the [[Sparta]]n [[harmost]]s. The term is variously rendered '''δαιμουργός''' (''daimourgos''), '''δαιμωργός''' (''daimorgos''), and '''δαμιεργός''' (''damiergos'') in [[Doric Greek]], and '''δημιοργός''' (''demiorgos'') in [[Ionic Greek]] on the island of [[Samos]]. In the Archaic Argolid, the demiurge seems to have served as a judge, and when one was lacking, his role could be fulfilled by a [[hierogrammat]], according to an inscription from [[Mycenae]] recorded in the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' IV, 493.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">The '''Egyptian Desert Land Law''' is an [[Egypt]]ian Law No. 143 of 1981 (and its amendments 55/1988, 205/1991, &amp; 96/1995) that governs the acquisition and ownership of desert land in Egypt.

== Desert Land in Egypt ==
Egypt is predominantly [[desert]]. Only 35,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 3.5% - of the total land area is [[Agriculture|cultivate]]d and permanently settled. Most of the country lies within the wide band of desert that stretches eastwards from Africa's [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Coast]] across the [[continent]] and into southwest Asia.

Egypt's main desert areas are:
* [[Western Desert (Egypt)|Western Desert]] (from the Nile valley to the border with [[Libya]] 
* [[Eastern Desert]] (from the Nile Valley to the [[Red Sea]] coast)
* [[Sinai Peninsula]]

== Principles of the Desert Land Law ==
Article 1 of Law No. 143 defines desert land as the land two kilometers outside the border of the city.
Certain limits are placed on the number of [[feddan]]s (one feddan is equal to 1.038 [[acre]]s or 4200 m²) that may be owned by individuals, families, co-operatives, partnerships and corporations:
* up to 150 feddans for individuals.
* up to 10,000 feddans for partnerships.
* up to 50,000 feddans for joint-stock companies.

Foreign partners and shareholders may be involved, provided Egyptians own at least 51% of the capital. However, upon liquidation of the company, the land must revert to Egyptians.
The lease of desert land for more than a period of 50 years shall also be considered to be ownership under Law 143.

Although companies formed under the Investment Law No. 8/1997 do not require Egyptian participation, companies that undertake projects over desert land must be owned in their majority by Egyptians. According to the law 55 of 1988, the President of the Republic may decide to treat Arab nationals as Egyptian nationals for purposes of this law.

[[File:Rijksdaalders met randschrift.jpg|thumb|"God zij met ons" on [[rijksdaalder]]s]]
[[File:Edge nederland s01.jpg|thumb|"God zij met ons"]]
'''''God zij met ons''''' ({{lang-en|God be with us}}) is a proverb phrase written on [[Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[coin]]s. This caption was formerly written on the edge of the [[Dutch guilder|guilder]], [[rijksdaalder]] (two and a half guilder), five guilders, ten guilders and twenty-five guilders and today on [[Dutch euro coins|2-euro Dutch coins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2004:051E:0238:0238:EN:PDF Written question P-2322/03 by Véronique De Keyser (PSE) to the Council], ''[[Official Journal of the European Union]]'', 2004. Retrieved 26 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

This shortened text expands into its Latin origin "Si Deus nobiscum quis contra nos" (If God is with us, who shall be against us?). This biblical motto was used in the [[Eighty Years' War]] and taken over by the [[Dutch Republic]] for use on its coins.

The '''[[British Indian Ocean Territory]]''', or in abbreviated form '''BIOT''', is an [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territory]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. It is administered by a [[Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory|Commissioner]], resident in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] in [[London]].

{{Politics of British Indian Ocean Territory}}

In terms of law, the territory is governed by the laws of the UK, where applicable; and in the case of persons subject to [[United States]] military law a special agreement applies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/bancoult-d16b1.html#ii U.S./U.K. BIOT agreements, 1966-1987] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716181503/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/jksonc/docs/bancoult-d16b1.html |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of the territory are based on the constitution, set out in the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/british_indian_ocean_territory_c|title=British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004 - a Freedom of Information request to Privy Council Office|date=9 November 2012|publisher=whatdotheyknow.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; which gives the Commissioner full powers to make laws for the territory.&lt;ref name="FCO"&gt;[http://biot.gov.io/governance British Indian Ocean Territory (British Overseas Territory)], [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. Retrieved 34 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cormacain, R. ‘Prerogative legislation as the paradigm of bad law-making: the Chagos Islands’ (2013) 39 Commonwealth Law Bulletin 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chief of state from 6 February 1952 has been Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. The commissioner for the territory has been Tony Crombie since January 2004, and the administrator has been [[Charles A Hamilton]] since 2002. The commissioner and administrator are both resident in the UK. The representative of the British government on the island is Cdr D. Howard RN.

There are no [[election]]s on the territory; the position of the [[monarch]] is hereditary and the commissioner and administrator are appointed by the monarch.

{{main article|Capital punishment in the British Indian Ocean Territory}}
Capital punishment is prohibited under the domestic law of the British Indian Ocean Territory, although in practice [[United States]] military law (which does provide for capital punishment) applies for most BIOT residents.

The '''Kokang people''' ({{zh|c=果敢族|p=Guǒgǎn Zú}}; {{lang-my|ကိုးကန့်လူမျိုး}}) are an [[ethnic group]] of [[Myanmar]]. They are [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking [[Han Chinese]]&lt;ref&gt;Burma has other, non-Kokang populations of Han Chinese; depending on what area of China they originally immigrated from, these populations speak [[Yunnan#Languages|Yunnanese]], [[Hokkien language|Hokkien]], [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Hakka language|Hakka]], and [[Hainanese]]. See {{cite book | chapter=The Ethnic Chinese in Myanmar and their Identity | author=Mya Than | title=Ethnic Chinese as Southeast Asians | year=1997 | editor=Leo Suryadinata | publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | location=Singapore | isbn=981-3055-58-8 | pages=117&amp;ndash;8}}&lt;/ref&gt; living in [[Kokang]], administered as [[Kokang Special Region]] (now [[Kokang Self-Administered Zone]]).&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-as-china-myanmar,0,2397711.story | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | author=Ng Han Guan | title=Ethnic rebels flee Myanmar, abandoning weapons and uniforms for safe haven in south China | accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
In 1997, it was estimated that the Kokang people, together with more recently immigrated [[Yunnan]]ese, constituted 30 to 40 percent of Myanmar's ethnic Chinese population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The Ethnic Chinese in Myanmar and their Identity | author=Mya Than | title=Ethnic Chinese as Southeast Asians | year=1997 | editor=Leo Suryadinata | publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies | location=Singapore | isbn=981-3055-58-8 | pages=119&amp;ndash;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Most Kokang are descendants of Chinese speakers who migrated to what is now [[Shan State]] in the 18th century. In the mid-17th century, the [[Yang (surname)|Yang clan]], a Chinese military house that fled with the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming loyalists]] from [[Nanjing]] to [[Yunnan Province]], and later migrated to the Shan State in eastern Myanmar, formed a feudal state called [[Kokang]]. From the 1960s to 1989, the area was ruled by the [[Communist Party of Burma]], and after the dissolution of that party in 1989 it became a special region of Myanmar.

The [[Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army]] (MNDAA) is a Kokang insurgent group. In August 2009 they clashed with [[Tatmadaw]] soldiers in a conflict fanned by controversial interests known as the [[2009 Kokang incident]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internationalrivers.org/blogs/227/chinese-dam-builders-fan-conflict-in-burma Chinese Dam Builders Fan Conflict in Burma]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Overload''' was a military operation by the [[Rhodesian Army]] that took place over six weeks starting on 27 July 1974. The operation resulted in the movement of 49,960 people into twenty-one [[Villagization|protected villages]] in the [[Chiweshe Tribal Trust Land]]. The people were moved into the protected villages to prevent them from being attacked or killed by the insurgents. Unfortunately the relocation resulted in the deaths of a few of the people being moved most likely due to attempts by the insurgents to prevent the relocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cilliers|first1=Jakkie|title=Counter-Insurgency in Rhodesia|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317499247|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=VHRKCAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=Counter-Insurgency+in+Rhodesia&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; But despite this unintended and regrettable tragedy the operation was a success due to professionalism of the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]].&lt;ref name=geldenhuys96&gt;{{Harvnb
|Geldenhuys
|Preller
|2007
|pp=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in the northern Chiweshe area had been subject to violent political intimidation by [[ZANLA]], and so for the most part moved willingly, but in the southern part of the area, where support for the cadres was a little stronger, a small amount resistance was encountered. The security forces destroyed the old huts after their occupants had moved. "In the short term, benefits seemed substantial," says Cilliers, "as insurgent activities were severely disrupted in [[Chiweshe]] for the following six months." The security forces immediately set about a similar operation called ''Overload Two'' in the Madziwa Tribal Trust Lands, which met with further success. 

==Aftermath==
Although initially successful, the protected villages ultimately proved counter-productive for the security forces. Cilliers cites the "lack of emphasis on concurrent socio-economic conditions" as a negative factor, pointing out the lack of sanitation and other facilities in most of the villages, as well as the fact that they were not sufficiently guarded. Wood agrees, saying that the villages "were never adequately policed or protected and the people were not involved in their management or persuaded of their necessity." Because of the inadequate financial backing for the PVs they were not developed properly, and their locations were often too far from the fields where the villagers grew their crops. 

The village administration was poor to the extent that in numerous cases ZANLA insurgents were able to use them as hiding places. "Most important of all," Wood concludes, the protected villages "took the people away from the burial sites of their ancestors, which they venerated." The PVs lasted until 1978, when they were dismantled. This combined with the effectiveness of the recently formed Selous Scouts to reduce ZANLA influence in the area and force the cadres back to the north, towards Mozambique.

The '''Pazeh''' (or '''Pazih'''; 巴則海 or 巴宰) people, including the [[Kaxabu people|Kaxabu]], are the descendants of the [[Tsouic]] Pazeh-speaking [[indigenous people]] from [[Taichung]] and [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]] areas of [[Taiwan]]. Due to the processes of [[acculturation]] and cultural [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], the majority of [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] who identify themselves as Pazeh reside in the [[Ai-lan district]] (愛蘭地區) in the central city of [[Puli, Nantou|Puli]], [[Nantou County|Nantou]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2014/06/15/2003592824&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
The current Pazih community is located around the Ai-lan (愛蘭) [[Taiwanese Presbyterian Church]], which provides support for the Pazeh cultural revival and political mobilization. The Ai-lan Pazih are currently petitioning [[Government of the Republic of China|Taiwan's government]] for official status as a recognized [[Taiwanese Aborigines|Taiwanese Aboriginal]] ethnic group.

'''"Penso em ti, eu sei"''' ("I Think of you, I know") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Adelaide Ferreira|Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letra da canção e outras informações sobre a canção|url=http://www.diggiloo.net/?1985pt|publisher=www.diggiloo.net|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song is a ballad, with Adelaide telling her lover how she feels as their relationship comes to an end. The lyrics suggest that she will in fact end the relationship the moment the song ends, thus producing the conflicted emotions she feels.

The song was performed ninth on the night, following [[Belgium]]'s [[Linda Lepomme]] with "[[Laat me nu gaan]]" and preceding [[Germany]]'s [[Wind (band)|Wind]] with "[[Für alle]]". At the close of voting, it had received 9 points, placing 18th in a field of 19.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 Contest]] by [[Dora (singer)|Dora]] with "[[Não sejas mau para mim]]".

'''Pinto's Loggia''' or '''Pinto's Lodge''' ({{lang-mt|It-Tribuna ta' Pinto - Il-Loġġa ta' Pinto}}), is a [[loggia]] in [[Qormi]], [[Malta]]. It was built in 1772 to commemorate the 31st year of [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]]'s magistracy, and it is now a landmark and symbol of Qormi.

==History==
Pinto's Loggia was built in 1772, marking the 31st year of the reign of [[Manuel Pinto da Fonseca]] as [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Grand Master]] of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]]. Qormi had been granted city status as ''Città Pinto'' on 25 May 1743, and the city still bears Pinto's coat of arms as its symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zammit|first1=Vincent|title=Il-Gran Mastri – Ġabra ta' Tagħrif dwar l-Istorja ta' Malta fi Żmienhom – It-Tieni Volum 1680–1798|date=1992|publisher=Valletta Publishing &amp; Promotion Co. Ltd.|location=[[Valletta]]|pages=427–428|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is supported by four columns, and it is decorated with Pinto's coat of arms and a [[Latin]] inscription. According to tradition, Pinto used to sit in the loggia to shade himself while watching [[horse racing]],&lt;ref name="lc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Residences|url=http://lc.gov.mt/Page.aspx?catid=70&amp;pid=190&amp;lid=1|website=lc.gov.mt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424095734/http://lc.gov.mt/Page.aspx?catid=70&amp;pid=190&amp;lid=1|archivedate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its original purpose is still unclear.&lt;ref name="dlhwalks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Twitchell-Waas|first1=Jeffrey|title=Ħal Qormi – Four walks through a historic city|date=2011|publisher=[[Din l-Art Ħelwa]]|location=[[Valletta]]|isbn=9789995731021|pages=43–44|url=http://dinlarthelwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Qormi-Walks-9.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424094202/http://dinlarthelwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Qormi-Walks-9.pdf|archivedate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[File:Pinto Farmhouse-stables and Loggia in Qormi.jpg|thumb|left|The farmhouse complex, used as stables]]
The loggia was originally part of a large farmhouse complex which included stables for the Grand Master's horses, but the farmhouses were demolished in 1981 to make way for modern houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residenzi Importanti|url=http://lc.gov.mt/Page.aspx?catid=70&amp;pid=190&amp;lid=2|website=lc.gov.mt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424103859/http://lc.gov.mt/Page.aspx?catid=70&amp;pid=190&amp;lid=2|archivedate=24 April 2016|language=Maltese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parish Church of St. Sebastian was later built in the vicinity of the loggia.&lt;ref name="dlhwalks"/&gt;

The loggia was restored in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guillaumier|first1=Alfie|title=Bliet u Rħula Maltin|date=1987|publisher=Valletta Publishing &amp; Promotion Co.

According to the Belarusian opposition, the Presidential Security Service has played a key role in the events around the [[Belarusian referendum, 1996|controversial referendum of 1996]], which has resulted in the dissolution of the disloyal [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]] and an ultimate concentration of state power in the hands of authoritarian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://govorim.by/novosti-belarusi/29040-andrey-klimov-esli-by-ne-predatelstvo-rukovodstva-verhovnogo-soveta-lukashenko-ne-udalos-by-sovershit-perevorot.html|title=Андрей Климов: Если бы не предательство руководства Верховного Совета, Лукашенко не удалось бы совершить переворот|trans-title=Andrey Klimau:"If there wouldn't be a treason by the Supreme Soviet, Lukashenko would not have managed to organize his coup d'etat"|date=24 November 2011|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hancar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nv-online.info/np/viktor-gonchar-ya-gord-tem-chto-mne-udalos-sdelat/|title=Виктор ГОНЧАР: «Я горд тем, что мне удалось сделать…»|trans-title=Viktar Hanchar:"I'm proud of what I've managed to do..."|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belaruspartisan.org/politic/106262/|title=Десять лет назад сотрудники Службы безопасности президента захватили Центризбирком|trans-title=Ten years ago, soldiers of the Presidential Security Service took over the Central Elections Commission|date=20 November 2006|publisher=[[Belorussky Partizan]]|language=Russian|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the controversial referendum, the Presidential Security Service has blocked the office of the [[Central Election Commission of Belarus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.tut.by/society/520859.html|title=Интервью с Лидией Ермошиной: Пока ты в системе — ты должен быть лоялен к власти|trans-title=Interview with Lidiya Yermoshina: "As long as you are in the System, you have to be loyal to the authorities"|last=Ванкович|first=Александр|date=22 November 2016|publisher=[[TUT.by]]|language=Russian|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prevented the Head of the Commission, [[Viktar Hanchar]] from executing his role.&lt;ref name=hancar/&gt; [[Lidia Yermoshina]], a member of the Commission loyal to Lukashenko, has been appointed instead of Hanchar. Three years later, Viktar Hanchar has disappeared and was presumably murdered.

After the events, the [[United States]] [[United States Department of State|State Department]] stated that the Presidential Guard is a [[secret police]] force under the control of [[President of Belarus|President]] [[Alexander Lukashenko]]. The State Department in 1996 stated the guard was allowed to use force "''against the President's political enemies with no judicial or legislative oversight."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/1999/319.htm|title=Country Reports on Human Rights Practices Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor 1999|date=February 23, 2000|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions against officers of the Presidential Guard===

Several former Heads of the Presidential Security Service have been included in the sanctions lists of the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]]:&lt;ref&gt;[https://nn.by/?c=ar&amp;i=61552 Поўны спіс 208 беларускіх чыноўнікаў, якім забаронены ўезд у ЕС] - [[Nasha Niva]], 11.10.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been included in the [[List of people and organizations sanctioned in relation to human rights violations in Belarus|sanctions list of the European Union in 2011]] and is one of four persons remaining under EU sanctions after 2016. He is also on the sanctions list of the [[United States]]. Besides that, as one of the persons accused of involvement in the disappearances of 1999-2000, Naumov remains one of the few people on the sanctions list of the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=1498|title=OFAC Sanctions List Search|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been included in the [[List of people and organizations sanctioned in relation to human rights violations in Belarus|sanctions list of the European Union in 2011]].

* [[Yuri Zhadobin]] has been described in the [[European Council|EU Council]]'s 2012 decision on sanctions as follows: ''"As a member of the Security Council, he approves the repressive decisions agreed at ministerial level, including the decision to repress the peaceful demonstrations on 19 December 2010. After December 2010, he praised the "total defeat of destructive forces", when referring to the democratic opposition."'' &lt;ref name=EU2012/&gt; He has been included in the [[List of people and organizations sanctioned in relation to human rights violations in Belarus|sanctions list of the European Union in 2011]].

* [[Andrei Vtiurin]] has allegedly supervised interrogations of arrested protesters after the demonstrations that followed 2010 presidential elections.  He has been included in the [[List of people and organizations sanctioned in relation to human rights violations in Belarus|sanctions list of the European Union in 2011]].&lt;ref name=EU2012/&gt;

The '''Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Barska nadbiskupija'' / Барска надбискупија, {{lang-sq|Kryedioqeza e Tivarit}}, {{lang-la|Archidioecesis Antibarensis}}) is an ecclesiastical territory or [[diocese]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref name=CathHierBar&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dbary.html "Archdiocese of Bar (Antivari)"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

Retrieved February 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It is centred in the city of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Italian ''Antivari''). It was erected as a diocese in the 9th century and elevated to an archdiocese in 1089. The Archbishopric was by Pope's decree abolished some time after 1140, until it was restored by the Serbian medieval [[Nemanjić]] dynasty in 1199. 

The Archbishops regularly bore titles of "[[Primate (bishop)|Primates]] of Serbia" (''Primas Serviae''), implemented as a permanent part of the title by Archbishop [[Stephen Tegliatti]] in 1475, since 1256 early on self-styled as "Archbishop of Slavians".&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Serbs, referring to the Serbian medieval state&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, [[Traboin]], [[Tuzi]], [[Grude]], and [[Klezna]] were added to the Archbishopric from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shkodër-Pult|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shkodër]]. In 1969, the territory of the municipalities of [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], [[Gusinje]], and [[Vojno Selo]] were added to the Archbishopric from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Skopje]].

'''''The Twenty-Second Day''''' is a 2007 [[novel]] by [[Muhammad Aladdin]], and has been published by [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929032913/http://elainpublishing.com/ '''ِEl-'Ain'''] Publishing House in [[Egypt]].

==Plot introduction==
A young man, a pianist who hates piano, goes into a stormy relationship with a divorced woman who's older than he is for ten years. This woman, a painter and artistic trainer for children, was his first choice in 26 years of life as a slave for his father's wishes, or maybe it's the cosmic wishes of fate itself, as he might feel as a crushed young man who wished to be anything but being what he is. He received a total shock when the woman dumped him at last, did an abortion for his baby, and tells him that they can't live up the relation they have, because it goes to be crushed, sooner or later.
in the final scene, we see the painter watches the TV, we could understand he's witnessing the US forces entering [[Baghdad]], then he begin to prepare his suitcase, which gives us a hint he's going to leave the country.

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==

The second novel published by the Egyptian writer [[Muhammad Aladdin]], also known as Alaa Eddin (Arabic:محمـد علاء الديـن) . Aladdin has gained acclamation for his first novel published [[The Gospel According to Adam]] (Arabic:إنجيل آدم) in January 2006. The work has been hailed by writers like [[Bahaa Taher|Baha Tahir]] and [[Sonallah Ibrahim]] to be among the best of a promising new crop. Then came The Twenty-Second day (Arabic: اليوم الثاني و العشرون) in 2007, published by El 'Ain publishing house. The novel gained a warm receiving from the either readers and writers,  it "has a specific unique world was delightfully presented by Aladdin", as Muhammad Hisham 'Abya wrote in the Egyptian famous [http://www.boswtol.com/aldiwan/nkasakees_137_06.html'''boswtol'''] website, and "it follow up his (Aladdin) first  novel The Gospel According to Adam, continuing his writing usual course which is anti-stereotyping and anti-mechanical", As Nour Al- Asa'd wrote in the prestigious Lebanese newspaper [http://www.annahar.com'''An Nahar'''] ( April 24, 2007), "having such minimalistic language and style, clearing psychological depth in either the hero's persona, or towards the world around" as the Egyptian notable writer [[Bahaa Taher|Baha' Taher]] commented in a seminar held for the novel. 
In an interview with the Egyptian prestigious literary newspaper [https://web.archive.org/web/20070909103427/http://www.akhbarelyom.org.eg/adab/ '''Akhbar Al Adab'''], it was mentioned the secret of the title, the twenty-second day, by referring to the day US forces entered Baghdad, and the connection between a failure of a love affair, as a personal matter, and the failure of a pan-Arab dream, as a general matter. "It's like you are very far and very close at the same time", said Aladdin, commenting on the not that this connection isn't so easy to discover.

The '''Vested Property Act''' is a controversial law in [[Bangladesh]] that allows the Government to confiscate property from individuals it deems as an ''enemy of the state''. Before the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, it was known as the Enemy Property Act and is still referred to as such in common parlance. The act is criticized as a tool for appropriating the lands of the minority population.

==Background==
{{Persecution of Bengali Hindus}}

===Legal history===

This law is the culmination of several successive discriminatory laws against non-Muslims passed while Bangladesh was part of Pakistan.

Chronologically, they are:
* The East Bengal (Emergency) Requisition of Property Act (XIII of 1948)
* The East Bengal Evacuees (Administration of Property) Act (VIII of 1949)
* The East Bengal Evacuees (Restoration of Possession) Act (XXII of 1951)
* The East Bengal Evacuees (Administration of Immovable Property) Act (XXIV of 1951)
* The East Bengal Prevention of Transfer of Property and Removal of Documents and Records Act of 1952
* The Pakistan (Administration of Evacuees Property) Act (XII of 1957)
* The East Pakistan Disturbed Persons (Rehabilitation) Ordinance (No 1 of 1964)
* The Defence of Pakistan Ordinance (No. XXIII of 6 September 1965)
* The Defence of Pakistan Rules of 1965
* The Enemy Property (Custody and Registration) Order of 1965
* The East Pakistan Enemy Property (Lands and Buildings Administration and Disposal Order of 1966).
* The Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) Ordinance No. 1 of 1969
* Bangladesh (Vesting of Property and Assets) President's (Order No. 29 of 1972).
* The Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provisions) (Repeal) Act (XLV of 1974)
* The Vested and Non-Resident Property (Administration) Act (XLVI of 1974)
* The vested and Non-Resident (Administration) (Repeal) Ordinance 1976 The Ordinance, (No. XCII of 1976).
* The Ordinance No. XCIII of 1976.

On 6 November 2008, the High Court division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh delivered its [[rule nisi]] upon the Government on the Enemy Property (Continuance of Emergency Provision) (Repeal) Act 1974 and subsequently promulgated Arpita Sampatty Protapyan Ain 2001 and circulars, administrative orders.

The order calls upon the respondent to show cause as to why instructions issued in the contents of presidential order 29 of 1972, act 45 and 46 of 1974, ordinance No. 92, 93 of 1976, Arpita Sampatty Protapyan Ain 2001 and circulars issued by government that are in contradiction with the fundamental rights and the charter of declaration of Independence of Bangladesh, 10 April 1971, should not be declared to be [[ultra vires]] the constitution.The Rule Nisi also stated why the properties so far incorporated in the list as Enemy (Vested) should not be returned to the title holder/successor/legal possession holders and or such other or further order or orders passed as to this Court may seem fit and proper. The Rule is made returnable within 4 weeks from 28 October 2008.  {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Renamed as Vested Property Act===

Though renamed as the Vested Property Act in 1974, the law still retains the fundamental ability to deprive a Bangladeshi citizen of his/her property simply by declaration of that person as an enemy of the state. Leaving the country through abandonment is cited as the most common reason for this, and it is frequently the case {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} that Hindu families who have one or several members leaving the country (due to religious atrocities against Hindus, and economic as well as political reasons) have their entire property confiscated due to labeling as enemy.&lt;ref name=refworldunhc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MRGI,,BGD,,49749d572d,0.html |title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Bangladesh : Hindus |date=2 May 2012 |website=UNHCR |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018084914/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,MRGI,,BGD,,49749d572d,0.html |archive-date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurable impact==

===Newspaper reports===

The Bangladeshi newspaper ''[[The Sangbad]]'' (21 March 1977) reported that at that point in time, according to the government's own figures, 702,335 acres (2,842&amp;nbsp;km²) of cultivable land and 22,835 homes were listed as enemy property. {{More citations needed|date=November 2008}}

===Prominent cases===

Much of the property of murdered Hindu politician [[Dhirendranath Datta]] was confiscated by the Bangladesh government after independence in 1971 {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. Because Datta's body was never found after he was arrested by the [[Pakistan Army]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], an affidavit was brought forward that it could not be concluded that Datta had not voluntarily left the country.

The family property of Nobel Prize–winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] had been confiscated by the Pakistan government. In 1999, the Bangladesh government announced that it was investigating opportunities to return the property to Sen's family.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/law/2007/04/03/rights.htm |title=Vested Property Act: A story of deprivation and exploitation |author=Dipanwita Roy |date=21 April 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barkat's seminal work===

A seminal book by Professor Abul Barkat of [[Dhaka University]], ''Inquiry into Causes and Consequences of Deprivation of Hindu Minorities in Bangladesh through the Vested Property Act'', was published in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It demonstrated that 925,050 Hindu households (40% of Hindu families in Bangladesh) have been affected by the Enemy Property Act. This included 748,850 families dispossessed of agricultural land. The total amount of land lost by Hindu households as a result of this discriminatory act was estimated at 1.64 million acres (6,640&amp;nbsp;km²), which is equivalent to 53 per cent of the total land owned by the Hindu community and 5.3 per cent of the total land area of Bangladesh.

The survey also showed that the beneficiaries of the land grab through the act cut across all party lines. The political affiliation of direct beneficiaries of appropriated property was:
* [[Bangladesh Awami League]] 44.2%
* [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP) 31.7%
* [[Jatiya Party (Ershad)|Jatiya Party]] 5.8%
* [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] 4.8%
* Others 13.5%

The greatest appropriation of Hindu property took place immediately after independence during the first Awami League government (1972–75) and during the first period of rule of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (1976-1980). Barkat's work also showed that since 1948, 75% of the land of religious minorities in East Pakistan and subsequent Bangladesh had been confiscated through provisions of the act.

Barkat also emphasized that less than 0.4% of the population of Bangladesh has benefited from the Enemy Property Act, demonstrating that this law has been abused by those in power through corruption, with no demonstrated sanction by the population at large.

===Effect on Bangladeshi demographics===

The law in its implementation has been seen as a major driver behind the reduction of the [[Hinduism in Bangladesh|Bangladeshi Hindu]] population, which has declined from an estimated 30% in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;http://hinduism.about.com/od/history/a/humanrights.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  to 17% in 1965 to 16% today,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background Note: Bangladesh|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3452.htm|publisher=Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, U.S. Department of State|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a loss of around 11 million people. Most of this population left for India, while the more affluent Bangladeshi Hindus leaving due to the act have moved to USA, Canada, Europe and Australia.

==Repeal of the act==

During Bangladesh's first three decades of independence many politicians made empty promised to repeal the act. The first government of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman vowed to repeal any laws that contradicted the values of the newly liberated country; the Enemy Property Act contravened non-communal provisions of the new constitution. But instead of being repealed it was sustained under a new name in 1974.

Finally in the run up to the 2001 election [[Sheikh Hasina]] and the [[Awami League]] succeeded in a drive to repeal the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/bangla14864.htm |title=Bangladesh: Essential Background |date=2007 |website=Human Rights Watch |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224083954/http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/bangla14864.htm |archive-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The legacy of enemy turned vested property act in Bangladesh |url=http://www.asiantribune.com/index.php?q=node/5925 |newspaper=Asian Tribune |date=29 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2002/14021.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2002: Bangladesh], US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;  The Vested Properties Return Act (2001) was implemented (in a session boycotted by the opposition BNP and Jamaat members) in an effort to make amends for the confiscated property. However little progress has been made in returning or compensating lost property under the [[Khaleda Zia]] government from 2001-2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hindu properties continue to be 'vested' |url=http://www.newagebd.com/2007/may/26/front.html#1 |newspaper=New Age |location=Dhaka |date=26 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930203518/http://www.newagebd.com/2007/may/26/front.html#1 |archive-date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, [HRCBM (Human Rights Congress for Bangladesh Minorities)] [http://www.hrcbm.org/] filed a writ before [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]] under article 102 of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quandaryreflection.blogspot.com/2008/08/hrcbms-litigation-against-government-of.html WRIT PETITION NO. 6092 OF 2008], HRCBM (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==International concern==

Congressman Crowley of the Bangladesh-American caucus has called for the repeal of the act {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}, as have several Bangladeshi politicians and human rights activists. The current opposition Awami League has vowed to repeal the act if returned to power in the next elections, even though it has yet to acknowledge its own participation in implementation of the act during the 1972-75 period.

An international conference organized by several Hindu activist groups held in London on 16 June 2005 was addressed by, among others, Lord Avebury of the British House of Lords and called for repeal of the act. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The law has been highlighted by the [[U.S. Department of State]] and [[Amnesty International]] as a major human rights concern that has contributed to internal displacement, emigration and disenfranchisement. {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
