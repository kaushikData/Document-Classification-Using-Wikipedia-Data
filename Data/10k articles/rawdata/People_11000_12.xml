'''Abigail Kuaihelani Maipinepine Bright, Mrs. Campbell''' (August 22, 1858 – November 1, 1908) was a member of the nobility of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. During her life, she married two powerful businessmen, particularly adding to the success of her first husband, [[James Campbell (industrialist)|James Campbell]], and giving him descendants. Among their grandchildren were three heirs to the throne of the kingdom of Hawaii.

James Campbell, Sr. died in 1900 and bequeathed his widow one-third of the estate during her lifetime.

After the 1893 [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], Abigail Campbell and Emma Nāwahī, wife of [[Joseph Nāwahī]], became leaders of the Hawaiian native movement for protesting the takeover, called ''Hui Hawai{{okina}}i Aloha {{okina}}Āina o Na Wahine'' (Hawaiian Women's Patriot League).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Noenoe K.

The Campbell estate owned the St. James Hotel in [[San Jose, California]]. At the time, Abigail Campbell was also preparing to celebrate the wedding of her daughter Abigail to Prince [[David Kawānanakoa]], which took place two days later.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">'''Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ), a [[Saudi]] who reportedly lived in Yemen, is believed to have been rendered by the [[CIA]] to [[Jordan]] in early 2002.  His real name is believed to be Ahmad Ibrahim Abu al-Hasana.

Al-Jeddawi was listed by the FBI as a wanted terrorism suspect in February 2002. He was identified as a known associate of a Yemeni Al Qaeda leader named [[Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei]].

==February 12, 2002 terror alert==
In early 2002, according to an FBI report, as a result of US military operations in [[Afghanistan]] and of on-going interviews of detainees in [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]], information became available on February 11, 2002 regarding threats to US interests which indicated that a planned attack may have been about to occur in the United States or against US interests in the country of Yemen on or around the next day, February 12, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/2-11-02.htm FBI Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information 2-11-02] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020605061032/http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/2-11-02.htm |date=2002-06-05 }}, (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on February 11, 2002, the FBI listed Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi and 16 other suspected terrorists to the [[FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list]]. The early version of that list was then known as the "Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information" list. Years later, the FBI removed his profile from the main page of that list.

On February 14, 2002, several days after the FBI alert, six of the names were removed from the list, and the FBI re-published the list with only eleven names and photos. Six of the suspects who had been named were already in custody.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/2-14-02.htm FBI Most Wanted Terrorists Seeking Information 2-14-02] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020610170928/http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/seekinfo/2-14-02.htm |date=2002-06-10 }}, revision by FBI removed 6 Yemen prisoners' names from the list (dead link)&lt;/ref&gt;

The six names identified in the Yemen plot on February 11, 2002, but who were removed from the list on February 14, 2002, are: [[Issam Ahmad Dibwan al-Makhlafi]], [[Ahmad al-Akhader Nasser Albidani]], [[Bashir Ali Nasser al-Sharari]], [[Abdulaziz Muhammad Saleh bin Otash]], [[Shuhour Abdullah Mukbil al-Sabri]] and Riyadh Shikawi.

'''Abu Mu'az al-Jeddawi''' remained listed among the eleven names still being sought on February 14, 2002.  The others who also remained were: Fawaz Yahya al-Rabeei, [[Omar Ahmad Omar al-Hubishi]], [[Ammar Abadah Nasser al-Wa'eli]], [[Alyan Muhammad Ali al-Wa'eli]], [[Bassam Abdullah bin Bushar al-Nahdi]], [[Mustafa Abdulkader Aabed al-Ansari]], [[Samir Abduh Sa'id al-Maktawi]], [[Abdulrab Muhammad Muhammad Ali al-Sayfi]], [[Abu Nasr al-Tunisi]] and [[Amin Saad Muhammad al-Zumari]].

Whether foiled, aborted, or merely incorrect specific intelligence, the February 12, 2002 attack never occurred.

==CIA Rendition to Jordan==

Human Rights Watch has reported that al-Jeddawi was rendered by the CIA to Amman, Jordan, in early 2002, where he was held in the custody of the Jordan's General Intelligence Department (GID).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/node/62263/section/5 Human Rights Watch, Double Jeopardy: CIA Rendition to Jordan (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Human Rights Watch researchers spoke to two former detainees held by the GID who said that they communicated with al-Jeddawi while he was detained at the GID detention facility in late 2002; a third former detainee wrote that he saw al-Jeddawi there, too.

Human Rights Watch's sources differ regarding where al-Jeddawi was arrested.  Both al-Tabuki and another person claim that al-Jeddawi was arrested in [[Yemen]].  Al-Tabuki said that he was arrested less than a month after his wedding.  A third source, however, who was also held in GID custody with al-Jeddawi, believes that al-Jeddawi was arrested in Kuwait, although he was not certain about this point.  All of them agree, at any rate, that al-Jeddawi was in US custody prior to being handed over to Jordan.  And according to one source, a US agent "hit him in the head."

One person, who told Human Rights Watch that al-Jeddawi was "famous in Afghanistan," said:

&lt;small&gt;He was a really rich guy, and he lived in [[Yemen]]; he was married to a Yemeni woman.  The Yemenis arrested him and handed him over to the US.  I actually saw him in GID: we met in the bathroom thanks to the help of a nice soldier.&lt;/small&gt;

This same informant not only saw al-Jeddawi in custody in late 2002 but also communicated with al-Jeddawi's family later. He said that the family told him that al-Jeddawi was held at the GID facility for more than a year, during which time he was kept hidden from the ICRC.  Al-Jeddawi is believed to be currently incarcerated in Saudi Arabia.

'''Alex Vause''' is a fictional character played by [[Laura Prepon]] on the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''. The character is loosely based on the real ex-girlfriend of [[Piper Kerman]], author of ''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]''. Before her arrest, Vause worked for an international drug cartel and was in a relationship with protagonist [[Piper Chapman]], who once transported drug money for her during their travels. Vause is portrayed as the catalyst for Chapman's [[indictment]]. She is reunited with her ex-lover in federal prison, nearly a decade after the events that led to their breakup. Her relationship with Chapman is reignited, as they carry out a tumultuous love affair in prison. Vause is noted for her pragmatism, forthrightness, wit and veiled vulnerability. She is a main character in seasons one, three, four, five, and six and a recurring character in season two.

The character of Alex Vause is loosely based on Catherine Cleary Wolters, ex-girlfriend of [[Piper Kerman]], the author of ''[[Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison]]'' and an executive consultant on the series.&lt;ref name="Sue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/04/orange-is-the-new-black-real-alex|title=The Real Alex of Orange Is the New Black Speaks for the First Time: "I Was Not Piper's First, and I Certainly Did Not Seduce Her"|website=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|first=Sue|last=Carswell|date=April 15, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/orange-new-black-author-hints-new-season-talks-reform-way-stl#stream/0|title='Orange Is the New Black' Author Hints At New Season, Talks Reform, On Way To STL|first=Nancy|last=Fowler|publisher=[[St. Louis Public Radio]]|date=September 1, 2014|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kerman's memoir, Wolters is given the pseudonym Nora Jansen, who is a marginal character in the book.&lt;ref name="Cal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/05/10/real-life-alex-on-oitnb-feared-show-would-ruin-her-life/|title=Real-life Alex on 'OITNB' feared show would ruin her life|last=Callahan|first=Maureen|date=May 10, 2015|website=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In actuality, Kerman and Wolters did not serve their prison sentences together as depicted in the series however they were reunited in a flight to [[Chicago]], where they were detained for several weeks [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago|in a detention facility]] to testify in the drug trafficking case.&lt;ref name="Sue"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/tv/article/Orange-is-the-New-Black-author-and-husband-tell-5647662.php|title='Orange Is the New Black' TV series reflects couple's reality|website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|first=Meredith|last=May|date=July 27, 2014|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their stint in Chicago is portrayed in the series' second season; however, the defendant they were to testify against was changed to the cartel's kingpin, as was the fact that Wolters and Kerman were cell-mates in the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/orange-is-the-new-black/247386/orange-is-the-new-black-how-the-book-adds-to-the-show|title=Orange Is the New Black: How the Book Adds to the Show|website=[[Den of Geek]]|first=Abigail|last=Brady|date=July 2, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lstylegstyle.com/stories/the-real-piper-of-orange-is-the-new-black/|title=The Real Piper of Orange is the New Black|website=L Style G Style|first=Lynn|last=Yeldell|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=June 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617151356/http://www.lstylegstyle.com/stories/the-real-piper-of-orange-is-the-new-black/|archive-date=2017-06-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolters met Kerman in 1991 in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], becoming friends around the time Kerman graduated from [[Smith College]]. Kerman wrote in her memoir that Wolters was part of a "clique of impossibly stylish and cool lesbians in their mid-30s".&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/12/211339427/behind-the-new-black-the-real-pipers-prison-story|title=Behind 'The New Black': The Real Piper's Prison Story|website=[[NPR]]|date=August 12, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters said both of them ran in "the same little [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Noho]] lesbian social circle", and spent time together when she returned from her travels.&lt;ref name="Sue"/&gt;   Wolters had told Kerman she worked for an African drug lord, moving heroin around internationally, while Kerman was fascinated by her globe-trotting, adventurous lifestyle.&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-14/news/ct-met-orange-new-black-20131114_1_piper-kerman-piper-chapman-drug-case|title='Orange is New Black' drug case still open in Chicago federal court|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|first=David|last=Heinzmann|date=November 14, 2013|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerman"&gt;{{cite book|title=Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison|author=Kerman, Piper|year=2010|publisher=[[Spiegel &amp; Grau]]|isbn=978-0-812-98618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters asked Kerman if she wanted to take part in the operation.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; According to Wolters, she and Kerman became romantically involved after Kerman had gotten involved in the drug ring. In her interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Wolters said that they were not girlfriends but friends with benefits, a notion with which Kerman disagreed, stating that they may have different perspectives about their time together and their relationship was complicated.&lt;ref name="Sue"/&gt;

Kerman traveled with Wolters to exotic places, and made several trips carrying drug-funds for the cartel. Kerman realized she needed to walk away when Wolters asked her to transport heroin instead of money, after which she flew home and started a new life.&lt;ref name="Riese"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/meet-the-real-alex-vause-catherine-cleary-wolters-has-mixed-feelings-about-orange-is-the-new-black/|title=Meet The Real Alex Vause: Catherine Cleary Wolters Has Mixed Feelings About "Orange Is The New Black"|website=[[Autostraddle]]|author=Riese|date=April 15, 2014|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt; Years later, Kerman was indicted and plead guilty to a money laundering charge, serving 13 months in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury|a minimum-security prison in Danbury, Connecticut]].

When Wolters and others involved in the drug ring were arrested by federal law enforcement, Wolters said that she, like the others, named everyone involved, including Kerman.&lt;ref name="Sue"/&gt; Wolters also stated that, contrary to Kerman's implication in her memoir, she was not "singularly responsible for [her] downfall", as she was honest about what she did and getting involved was Kerman's decision.&lt;ref name="Jeff"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://people.com/crime/cleary-wolters-meet-the-woman-who-inspired-alex-vause-orange-is-the-new-black/|title=Meet the Real-Life Alex Vause of Orange Is the New Black|last=Truesdell|first=Jeff|date=June 5, 2015|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kerman aimed to take responsibility for her actions, she said she still carried some resentment toward Wolters [for naming her], later making peace with her when they were held together in a Chicago facility.&lt;ref name="Sue"/&gt; Unlike in the series, Wolters and Kerman did not get back together when they were reunited in prison.&lt;ref name="Sue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riese"/&gt;

According to Wolters, "the only [physical] similarity between myself and [Vause] is my black glasses."&lt;ref name="Jeff"/&gt; In her memoir, Kerman described Wolters as a "droll" woman, with a "drawling, wisecracking husky voice" and a "playful, watchful way of drawing a person out"; "when she paid you attention, it felt as if she were about to let you in on a private joke."&lt;ref name="Kerman"/&gt; Wolters' interview to ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' in April 2014 led to a book deal for her memoir.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitney"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/cleary-wolters-out-of-orange_n_7226614.html|title=Cleary Wolters, The Real Alex Vause, Shares Her Story For The First Time|website=[[HuffPost]]|first=Erin|last=Whitney|date=May 7, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[HarperOne]] released ''Out of Orange'', Wolters' memoir covering from the circumstances of her involvement in the drug trafficking ring and her relationship with Kerman, to her arrest, prison experience, and the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/real-life-alex-vause-orange-new-black-328552|title=Q&amp;A: The Real-Life Alex Vause Discusses Prison, Memoir 'Out of Orange'|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=July 5, 2015|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/orange-is-new-black-character-725795|title=The Real Alex From 'Orange Is the New Black' Is Getting Her Own Book|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|first=Hillary|last=Lewis|date=August 15, 2014|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
{{update|section|date=September 2017}}

===Season 1===
Vause is introduced in the first episode through flashbacks; she and Chapman were both involved in crimes involving [[drug money]]. At the end of the first episode, the audience sees that Vause and Chapman are both serving their sentences in the same prison, Litchfield Penitentiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/orange-new-black-season-1-recap-everything-know-season-2-premiere-1593957|title='Orange Is The New Black' Season 1 Recap: Everything To Know Before The Season 2 Premiere|last=Schaefer|first=Megan|date=June 3, 2014|work=[[International Business Times]]|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two begin a romantic and sexual relationship in episode six; they are also both involved in a dispute with another inmate, [[Tiffany Doggett|Tiffany "Pennsatucky" Doggett]] ([[Taryn Manning]]), who locks Vause in a dryer and then attempts to kill Chapman in the season finale. Vause was raised solely by her mother and, in the ninth episode 'Fucksgiving', Vause's father is seen to be an influence on her being involved in the drug cartel.&lt;ref name="Thewire"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/06/your-guide-to-catching-up-to-orange-is-the-new-black-in-time-for-season-two/372080/|title=Your Guide to Catching Up to 'Orange Is the New Black' in Time for Season Two|last=Reid|first=Joe|date=June 3, 2014|work=The Wire|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Chapman realises that Vause was the one who told authorities about her illegal drug activities, they break off their relationship. Vause then becomes sexually involved with another inmate, [[Nicky Nichols]] ([[Natasha Lyonne]]).&lt;ref name="Thewire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/orange-is-the-new-black-recap-season-1-finale.html|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 1 Finale Recap: I Saw the Light|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=August 29, 2013|work=Vulture|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/191973-orange-is-the-new-black-recap-1-13-cant-fix-crazy/3|title="Orange is the New Black" recap (1.13): Can’t Fix Crazy|last=Davis|first=Ali|date=July 25, 2013|work=After Ellen|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
In the first episode, Vause promises Chapman that she will lie to protect her in the upcoming trial of her former boss [[Kubra Balik]]. She breaks this promise, however, and, after testifying against Balik, Vause manages to secure release from prison while Chapman remains incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/218712-orange-is-the-new-black-recap-2-1-thirsty-bird/3|title="Orange is the New Black" recap (2.1): Thirsty Bird|last=Piccoli|first=Dana|date=June 6, 2014|work=After Ellen|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After discovering that Balik was not imprisoned for his crimes, Vause fears for her life; she is also unable to leave her apartment due to the terms of her parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/06/orange-is-the-new-black-recap-season-2-episode-11-hunger-strike.html|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2, Episode 11 Recap: How About I Kill the Bitch?|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=June 18, 2014|work=Vulture|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/11/orange-is-the-new-black-recap-go-ahead-girls-take-a-break-from-your-values/|title=‘Orange Is the New Black’ Recap: ‘Go Ahead, Girls, Take a Break From Your Values’|last=Zernike|first=Kate|date=July 11, 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She visits Chapman in prison and confides in her that she is scared; Chapman then gets Bloom to tell Vause's parole officer that Vause is breaking her parole, which lands her back in prison, where she is safe from Balik's retribution.

===Season 3===
Vause appears in every episode of the third season. Chapman reports Vause to a parole officer and she is sent back to Litchfield prison; Chapman does eventually admit to doing this and the two begin frequently having [[hate sex]].&lt;ref name="Dibdin"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/ustv/s245/orange-is-the-new-black/review/a651710/orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-review-episodes-1-3-blend-comedy-and-tragedy.html|title=Orange is the New Black season 3 review: Episodes 1-3 blend comedy and tragedy|last=Dibdin|first=Emma|date=June 12, 2015|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/06/orange-is-the-new-black-review-mothers-daybed-bugs.html|title=

Vause is never questioned about his murder. Vause's guilt manifests itself in notes left around the prison, revealing Aydin's name. Chapman convinces Vause to find them all, and prepares to burn them.

==Critical commentary==
Matthew Wolfson of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' described Vause as intelligent, "with the instincts of a pragmatist, but without a strategy—a striking and emotionally direct person who may have closed off too many options for a workable future”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/orange-is-the-new-black-season-one|title=Orange Is the New Black: Season One|accessdate=April 30, 2017|date=July 16, 2013|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|author=Wolfson, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dana Poccoli of ''[[AfterEllen]]'' said that Vause could be considered a villain in the first season as she is the reason Chapman is in prison, but she is also a "fascinating character that we want to understand and spend time with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/tv/214952-the-return-of-the-lesbian-villain|title=The Return of the Lesbian Villain|first=Dana|last=Piccoli|website=[[AfterEllen]]|date=April 10, 2014|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'', Victoria Kezra similarly suggested that before the audience meets her, Vause is already a villain, for she is "responsible for Chapman’s illegal activities" and named her ex-lover to receive less prison time. What is "wonderful" about the character, Kezra added, is that the audience's "perception of her changes throughout the show", from a villainous figure to a sympathetic individual. She observed that Vause has "a great sense of humor about the whole situation" and is "pretty caring and insightful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/orange-is-the-new-black-the-daily-beast-staff-debates-whos-the-best-character|title='Orange Is the New Black': The Daily Beast Staff Debates Who's the Best Character|first=Victoria|last=Kezra|website=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s Liz Raftery considered Vause a polarizing character, asking "is she a master manipulator or just misunderstood?". She proposed that Vause "seems to think of herself as a bad person but maybe she isn't, whereas [Chapman] is so convinced that she's a good person and is totally taken aback whenever anyone challenges that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/laura-prepon-orange-is-the-new-black-alex-piper-1069067/|title=Orange Is the New Black's Laura Prepon: "Piper Is Just as Toxic as Alex|accessdate=April 30, 2017|date=August 11, 2013|website=[[TV Guide]]|author=Raftery, Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerri Mahn of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' wrote that unlike Chapman, Vause "doesn’t harbor any illusions about who she is or what playing by the rules will get her". Vause had named Chapman in her trial both to receive a lighter sentence and out of resentment from Chapman breaking her heart years earlier; she sincerely loves Chapman, Mahn considered, and "continually came to her defense throughout season one", turning her down when she realized Chapman was using her as "someone to fall back on when Larry doesn’t come through".&lt;ref name="Mahn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/orange-is-the-new-black/236206/orange-is-the-new-black-what-we-expect-in-season-two|title=Orange Is The New Black: What We Expect in Season Two|first=Gerri|last=Mahn|website=[[Den of Geek]]|date=June 6, 2014|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Surette of [[TV.com]] said that Vause's season one flashbacks fit the character well, and "instantly gave us a story to be interested in", as they provided a more rounded view of the character than Chapman's purview allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/community/post/orange-is-the-new-black-moscow-mulefcksgiving-review-the-shu-doesnt-fit-137546438918/|title=Orange Is the New Black "Moscow Mule"/"F*cksgiving" Review: The SHU Doesn't Fit|website=[[TV.com]]|date=August 7, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; J.M Suarez wrote in ''[[PopMatters]]'' that the character of Vause is "fearless and intimidating" as well as street-smart, contrary to Chapman who is "sheltered" and "often afraid and deferential", and it is "in highlighting these differences in prison, that their eventual backstories have even more impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/181721-orange-is-the-new-black-season-one-blu-ray|title='Orange is the New Black' Eases Us All Into Prison Life|website=[[PopMatters]]|first=J.M.|last=Suarez|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greco Patti of ''[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'' complimented Prepon's "nuanced" portrayal, and noted that, notwithstanding Vause's illicit occupation and her role in Chapman's imprisonment, she is a woman who "came from nothing, who loved and lost, and who maybe got used", and she seems more loyal and genuine in her love for Chapman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/laura-prepon-on-the-mystery-of-real-life-alex.html#|title=OITNB's Laura Prepon on Dancing to 'Milkshake,' Singing Meatloaf, and the Mystery of Real-Life Alex|first=Patti|last=Greco|date=August 16, 2013|website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|accessdate=June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The A.V.

According to McNutt, Vause's despondency regarding her absent father "could either gain [her] new perspective and put her life on the right track or [she could] try to fill the absence as quickly as possible", the latter of which she chose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/orange-is-the-new-black-the-complete-first-season-100992|title=Orange Is The New Black: "Fucksgiving"/"Bora Bora Bora"|first=Myles|last=McNutt|website=[[The A.V.

Vause "left her scruples at the door" when she built her worldly life on an alliance through her father's drug dealer, Mahn assessed. "She worked hard, gambled big, and lost everything".&lt;ref name="Mahn"/&gt; ''[[Autostraddle]]'' posited that Vause hates and fears vulnerability, and the scene where she is locked in a dryer and pleads Chapman to stay echoes the past, when Vause pleaded with Chapman before Chapman left following news of Vause's mother's death. Additionally, Vause is a complicated character for the writer, primarily because she found her sexual threat to Doggett "troubling", while seeing Vause as a young girl "who would do anything for the life she was cheated out of" was something with which she empathized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autostraddle.com/orange-is-the-new-black-episode-111-recap-ya-dun-goofed-190884/|title="Orange Is The New Black" Episode 111 Recap: Ya Dun Goofed|author=Kate|website=[[Autostraddle]]|date=August 13, 2013|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Den of Geek'', Chris Longo wrote that, as the first season played out, Vause "was vilified, then the tables turned when she won Piper’s friendship, then they turned upside down during their inevitable hookup.

The on-off lovers have "little meaningful interaction" with other characters while they are entangled in their tempestuous relationship, making them "emotionally unavailable" to other characters and to the audience.

Kelly Lawler  in ''[[USA Today]]'' suggested that, as opposed to how Chapman painted her, Vause's legitimate concerns over the danger she is in makes her one of the most rational individuals on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2015/06/13/orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-episode-8-recap-fear-and-other-smells/77511464/|title='Orange is the New Black' binge recap: 'Fear, and Other Smells'|website=[[USA Today]]|first=Kelly|last=Lawler|date=June 13, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perri Nemiroff of ''Collider'' said that Vause's season three flashbacks on her witnessing what her drug cartel boss is capable of made her present situation "far more dynamic and tense", giving her anxiety full credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-episode-8-9-recap/|title=ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK Recap: "Fear, and Other Smells" &amp; "Where My Dreidel At"|website=[[Collider]]|first=Perri|last=Nemiroff|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Sepinwall of ''[[Uproxx]]'' felt that Vause's flashback, like Nichols' in an earlier episode, was "covering familiar territory solely to support prominent stories each was getting in the present", but at least both flashbacks were "somber" enough to make them an "interesting contrast" to the concurrent comedic moments at Litchfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/review-orange-is-the-new-black-tongue-tiedfear-and-other-smells/|title=Review: 'Orange Is the New Black' – 'Tongue-Tied/Fear, and Other Smells'|website=[[Uproxx]]|first=Alan|last= Sepinwall|date=July 3, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the eleventh episode of the season, McNutt wrote that Vause's "isolation is turned around, and what once felt like a failure of the show’s writing becomes a logical character choice." Vause wants no part in what Chapman's prison business has turned into, knowing first-hand the dangers and the damage such an operation can cause. "I find myself respecting [Vause's] struggle to embrace her situation—it may not have served the season to this point," McNutt observed, "but it serves here as a productive counterpoint to [Chapman]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/orange-new-black-we-can-be-heroes-221150|title=Orange Is The New Black: "We Can Be Heroes"|first=Myles|last=McNutt|date=June 21, 2015|accessdate=June 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ambash, Vause [and Chapman's] notable absence from the third season's final group scenes – as Vause is trapped with the man who has been sent to kill her, and Chapman is off tattooing herself in the chapel – symbolizes their heightened distrust in others and the prison system itself. "For [Vause], unlike [Chapman], this wasn’t her choice. With safety stripped from her, and ties of trust cut by others, it’s no surprise [Vause] is kept away now from the freedom of the lake."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cutprintfilm.com/tv/orange-is-the-new-black-reviews/|title='Orange Is the New Black' Review: 3.11 "We Can Be Heroes" / 3.12 "Don't Make Me Come Back There" / 3.13 "Trust No Bitch"|website=CutPrintFilm|first=Emily|last=Ambash|date=July 21, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambash noted that Vause's season three storyline "highlights real issues regarding prisoners’ safety, especially when no real background checks are performed on new, untrained officers, who end up with easy access to inmates". Moreover, "it serves as a reminder that [Vause and Chapman] have basically switched roles" as Chapman embarked on "the smuggling business [and] showed little regard for [Vause]", finding a new sense of power and thrill in her illicit enterprise, while Vause wisely avoided it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cutprintfilm.com/tv/orange-is-the-new-black-review-3-07-tongue-tied-3-08-fear-and-other-smells/|title='Orange Is the New Black' Review: 3.07 "Tongue Tied" / 3.08 "Fear and Other Smells"|website=CutPrintFilm|first=Emily|last=Ambash|date=July 3, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauren Chval of ''Chicago Tribune'' remarked that what is great about Vause is "she knows who she is and what she wants", trusts her instincts and has "never flipped on her feelings for Chapman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-episode-9-recap-20150614-column.html|title='OITNB' episode 9 recap: The hot Aussie just made everything a lot more confusing|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|first=Lauren|last=Chval|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chval praised Prepon in the role, and remarked that Vause is "always more interesting in her scenes without Chapman".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-orange-is-the-new-black-season-3-episode-13-recap-20150618-column.html|title='OITNB' episode 13 recap: Let's just be free for a second|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|first=Lauren|last=Chval|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jen Chaney of ''Vulture'' noted that the "murky issues surrounding blame" are prompted from the outset of the season, as both Vause and Lolly become responsible for the homicide of the hit man, "yet neither of them are true 'murderers' in that both were motivated by self-defense. It’s a case of both women doing wrong and neither of them doing wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/06/orange-is-the-new-black-sympathy-aggressors-season-four.html|website=[[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]|title=Orange Is the New Black Challenges Us to Sympathize With Aggressors in Season 4|first=Jen|last=Chaney|date=June 20, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kornhaber of ''The Atlantic'' said that Vause's acknowledgement that her attacker "was a person", echoed "a mantra that’s surfaced in various forms across the season".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/06/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4-episode-13/487586/|website=[[The Atlantic]]|title=Orange Is the New Black: 'Toast Can't Never Be Bread'|first=Spencer|last=Kornhaber|date=June 21, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myles McNutt of ''The A.V.

Myles McNutt wrote that Vause being compelled to finish killing the man, instead of letting him die by Lolly's deed, "makes it more visceral, and creates an internalized event to frame her understanding of her status as a 'criminal' in the season to follow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/new-season-oitnb-begins-delusions-gangsta-238249|website=[[The A.V.

Club'' that the circumstances of Lolly's paranoia, the lack of evidence that the correctional officer was a hit man, the lack of trust in a broken system, and the difficulty in explaining away Vause and Lolly's actions in the homicide, meant that Lolly being taken away was "tragic" but ultimately "probably the best case scenario" when someone would have to be held responsible.&lt;ref name="answers"/&gt;

''Autostraddle''{{'s}} Kayla Kumari Upadhyaya considered Vause's decision to not tell Chapman what she has gone through an "emotionally significant" moment for the character. Vause is not on good terms with Chapman, but she also does not want Chapman to be implicated by it, Upadhyaya observed.

}}'''Andrew Gronholdt''' (26 August 1915 – 13 March 1998) was a famous [[Aleut people|Aleut]] from [[Sand Point, Alaska]] in the [[Shumagin Islands]] south of the lower [[Alaska Peninsula]] and became famous for rejuvenating the ancient [[Unangan]] art of carving hunting hats called ''[[Unangan hunting headgear|chagudax]]''.  In January 2012, a book was published posthumously by Gronholdt titled "'''''Chagudax''''':  A Small Window into the Life of An Aleut Bentwood Hat Carver"&lt;ref&gt;*Gronholdt, Andrew. 2012.  "Chagudax:  A Small Window into the Life of an Aleut Bentwood Hat Carver".  San Francisco:  Blurb, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gronholdt's woodworking techniques, wood steaming and bending methods, and instructional design methodologies were legendary.

== Early life ==
Andrew Gronholdt was born on August 26, 1915 in Sand Point on [[Popof Island]] in the [[Shumagin Islands]]. Gronholdt's father was [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66249492 Niels Peter Gronholdt] from [[Kerteminde, Denmark]]. Gronholdt's mother is [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66298488 Anna Dushkin], who was from a tiny Aleut village on the southside of the Alaska Peninsula named [[Belkofski]], about a dozen miles north east of [[King Cove, Alaska]]. The ancient [[Unangan]] people lived at Belkofski for thousands of years, but the community was closed about 1980 when everyone moved out, mostly to King Cove.

Andrew began attending elementary school in Belkofski and later completed grade school in Sand Point in the Shumagin Islands. Graduation from eighth grade at Sand Point School ended Gronholdt's formal education, but "his own desire to discover and explore schooled him for the rest of his life".&lt;ref&gt;Dye, Sharon. 2010.  Personal conversations with Andrew Gronhold's daughter&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 1942 at [[Unga, Alaska|Unga]], Gronholdt married [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66295942 Elisabeth Z. Rodgers], the daughter of Frank Rodgers and Zenia Lois Larsen.  They had one child, born in Seward.

==Chagudax==
[[File:Andrew gronholdt photography by david l clark slight retouch.jpg|thumb|right|alt text|Gronholdt Photo by David L. Clark, 1966]]
While living in Sand Point on Popof Island in the [[Shumagin Islands]] amongst the members of the [http://qttribe.org/ Qagun Tayagungin Tribe], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110419203706/http://www.ungatribe.org/ Unga Tribe], and the Pauloff Harbor Tribe,  Gronholdt designed ''chagudax'' (the ancient [[Unangan]] word for "hunting visor") in the [[Aleutians]].  Based upon the elaborate design of his maritime hunting ancestors, Gronholdt carved slabs of wood into thin blanks which he steamed and bent over molds to form the complex shapes of these ancient bentwood hats.

He began researching hat construction methods in 1985.&lt;ref name="chadwick" /&gt; Gronholdt, believing that the creation of these bentwood hunting hats was an important component of the ancient Unangan culture, went from [[Sand Point, Alaska|Sand Point]] to several other communities within the Aleutians, teaching others this lost art.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Lydia T.  "Aleut Art:  Unangam Aguqaadangin". Anchorage, Alaska:  Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Gronholdt taught at several schools including Sand Point and Unalaska.  Gronholdt's students teach chagudax at Aleut cultural camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|tLnPHWTi-Fs|Aleut culture camps}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chagudax classes are well attended, often filled to the limit.  Students cherish the chagudax which they carved, steamed, and bent.  They carry them home with a deep sense of cultural pride as a symbol of ancient Aleut ways.

The ''chagudax'' was an important component of the [[Unangan]] sea kayaker's hunting and battle uniform.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Lydia T.  "Glory Remembered:  Wooden Headgear of Alaska Sea Hunters."  Juneau, Alaska:  Alaska State Museums, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sight of a fleet of Aleut men, fully dressed in battle uniform with their ''chagudax'' and the decks of their sea kayaks bristling with razor sharp spears with which they were deadly accurate at long distances, struck fear into the hearts of enemies and excitement into the hearts of Aleut women. "All travelers are unanimous in stating that the Aleut in full attire and in his baidarka has a handsome and indeed a majestic appearance"(p.&amp;nbsp;275)&lt;ref&gt;Veniaminov, Ivan.  "Notes on the Islands of the Unalashka District".  Kingston, Ontario:  The Limestone Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gronholdt's visors are featured in collections at the [[Anchorage International Airport]], the [[Unalaska]] City School Percent for Art, the Shumagin Corporation and the Aleutian/Pribilof Islands Association.&lt;ref name="chadwick" /&gt;

==Gronholdt's other skills==

Gronholdt had a background as a wooden boat builder.&lt;ref name="chadwick" /&gt;  He also crafted wooden pumps, known as '''chxuusi-x''',&lt;ref&gt;Bergsland, Knut.  "Aleut Dictionary:  Unangam Tunudgusii".  Fairbanks, Alaska:  Alaska Native Language Center, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; which was used to bail water out of the skin-on-frame [[iqyax]], the Aleut sea kayaks.

==Civic life==

Gronholdt believed in the importance of the Aleut people getting involved and voicing their opinion to help make the community better, serving on the Board of Directors for the Shumagin Corporation (1972 through 1974) and serving for over 21 years (1977 through 1998) on the Board of Directors in several positions at the Aleut Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aleutcorp.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=32 "Past TAC Directors."] ''The Aleut Corporation''. 2008 (retrieved 28 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1989, Gronholdt was chosen as an instructor at the Institute of Alaska Native Art's prestigious ''Bending Tradition'' program which was "charged with creative energy"  (p.&amp;nbsp;10) and his area of the wood working shop quickly became known as "Aleut Corner" (p.&amp;nbsp;10) as the plethora of bentwood hunting visors poured forth.&lt;ref name="chadwick" /&gt;

Okalena Patricia Lekanoff-Gregory, Unalaska Aleut artist, has been one of Gronholdt's more prolific students, having instructed classes throughout the Aleutians and Northwest United States.  At the beginning of each of her classes, Okalena Patricia Lekanoff-Gregory tells all of her new students about her great instructor, Andrew Gronholdt, and has a fine portrait of Gronholdt displayed at the carving table, next to the carving knives.  An important component of Aleut values is to acknowledge Unangax elders.  In 2011 Lekanoff-Gregory worked with the Smithsonian's Arctic Studies Center to produce a video titled {{YouTube|bmhSelrkFEk|"The Artistry and History of the Aleutian Islands Bentwood Hat"}} in which she provides an overview of how the bentwood hats are carved, steamed, and bent.  Lekanoff-Gregory also honors having learned chagudax from Gronholdt.

==Death and legacy==
Gronholdt died on March 13, 1998 in [[Edmonds, Washington]] at the age of 82.&lt;ref name="chadwick"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/sop/sopv3i4.pdf |first=Jerah |last=Chadwick |title=Revival of Unangax̂/Aleut Hatmaking: In Memory of Andrew Gronholdt |work=Sharing Our Pathways |volume=3 |issue=4 |date=September–October 1998 |accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gronholdt was laid to rest at Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park next to his wife [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66295942 Elisabeth].   Their gravestone is engraved, "[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=gronholdt&amp;GSfn=andrew&amp;GSbyrel=all&amp;GSdyrel=all&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=66148152&amp;df=all&amp; Together Forever]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66148152 "Andrew Gronholdt."] ''Find a Grave''. (retrieved 28 March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since his death, some of his former students have continued his teaching.&lt;ref name="chadwick" /&gt; His legacy of building ''chagudax'' continues into the future as instructors at Aleut culture camp use forms and jigs he built to teach new generations about the proud warriors who defended their coastal villages wearing these unique hunting visors.  The [[Aleut Foundation]] offers the Andrew Gronholdt Scholarship Award to Aleut students majoring in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thealeutfoundation.org/ScholarshipGuide.aspx "Scholarship Guide."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724015049/http://www.thealeutfoundation.org/ScholarshipGuide.aspx |date=July 24, 2011 }} ''The Aleut Foundation.'' (retrieved 28 March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
In January 2012 Gronholdt's photographs, diary, and drawings were published in a book titled "[http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/2873796 Chagudax:  A Small Window into the Life of an Aleut Bentwood Hat Carver]".  Most of the material in the book was created by Gronholdt and includes many photographs of the chagudax which he designed, carved, steamed and bent.  The 96-page book, edited by Michael Livingston and Sharon Gronholdt-Dye, contains 144 illustrations.  Gronholdt's diary details his younger years in the Shumagin Islands when times were sometimes hardscrabble such as near-starvation of the entire Gronholdt family on remote Dolgoi Island in the 1920s.  Gronholdt's distinctly optimistic world view shines a bright light into life in the Shumagin Islands in the early 20th century.

According to the [[Book of Mormon]], '''Antipus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|t|ɪ|p|ə|s}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «ăn´tĭ-pus»&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Nephite]] military commander who lived in the 1st century BC.  The story of Antipus and his army is detailed in the 56th chapter of the [[Book of Alma]].  In 66 BC Antipus' army was strengthened with the 2,000 warriors under the leadership of [[Helaman]].  Helaman and Antipus engaged the invading [[Lamanite]] army by a stratagem in which Helaman and his 2,000 played decoy.  Helaman was to lead away the Lamanite army while Antipus attacked from behind.  After three days of the Lamanites pursuing Helaman, Antipus and his army finally overtook and engaged the Lamanites.  However, in the battle Antipus was slain and his army only avoided complete defeat when Helaman and his 2,000 also joined the battle.

'''Arnold Judas Rimmer'''&lt;ref name="better than life episode"/&gt; is a [[fictional character]] in the [[science fiction]] [[situation comedy]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', played by [[Chris Barrie]]. He is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule. After he is killed by a radiation leak during a [[timeskip]] in the series' first episode "[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the ‘H’ symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode "[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode "[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.

It remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school. They joke that only the boy's name was used, and not his personality because that would imply he had one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nazzaro |first=Joe |date=1994 |title=The Making of Red Dwarf |publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1980s ====
[[File:Intangible Rimmer.jpg|thumb|Resurrected as a 'soft-light' hologram, Rimmer was unable to touch or interact with his environment until the series VI episode "[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]" where he became a 'hard-light' hologram.]]
Rimmer first appeared in ''Red Dwarf''{{'}}s first episode "[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]" (1988), where he is characterised as second technician on board the mining ship ''[[Red Dwarf spacecraft#Red Dwarf|Red Dwarf]]'', ranking above [[Dave Lister]] ([[Craig Charles]]), the lowest ranked crew member on board the ship with whom he shares quarters, and below all four of the service robots. As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[chicken soup]] [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his "engineer's exam" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] ([[Norman Lovett]]) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a [[hologram]], having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board ''Red Dwarf'' is a creature called "[[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]]" ([[Danny John-Jules]]), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis.&lt;ref name="the end"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The End |episode-link=The End (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=15 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of "[[Future Echoes]]" (1988), Rimmer claims to have taken the "astronavigation exam" without passing nine times, or "[t]en, if you count the time [he] had [his] spasm." He also claims in this episode that his father had said, "Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut, and you can cope with anything," right before "that unfortunate [[suicide]] business".&lt;ref name="future echoes"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Future Echoes |episode-link=Future Echoes |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=22 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Balance of Power (Red Dwarf)|Balance of Power]]" (1988), Holly reveals that reason Rimmer was brought back as a hologram was because, in Holly's judgment, Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane because the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, making Rimmer the crew member with which Lister had the most interaction; in Holly's judgment, the fact that their interactions were almost entirely antagonistic was irrelevant. Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.&lt;ref name="balance"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.&lt;ref name="balance" /&gt;

In "[[Confidence and Paranoia]]" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]]. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by [[Craig Ferguson]]), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.&lt;ref name="confidence"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Confidence and Paranoia |episode-link=Confidence and Paranoia |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Me²]]" (1988), Rimmer is shown moving in with his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are "[[gazpacho soup]]". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that "anybody could make a mistake like that." His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his "death" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the "gazpacho soup" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.&lt;ref name="me squared"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Me² |episode-link=Me² |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite "Future Echoes" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in "[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]]. Rimmer's father also stretched his sons on a [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] machine to make them taller, causing Frank to be 6'5" by the time he was eleven. Rimmer disliked his parents enough to the point where he [[divorce]]d them from himself when he was fourteen; Rimmer getting paid [[Alimony|maintenance]] until employment age and access to the family dog every fourth weekend.&lt;ref name="better than life episode"/&gt;

According to "[[Thanks for the Memory (Red Dwarf)|Thanks for the Memory]]" (1988), Rimmer did a maintenance course at Saturn Tech. Rimmer also claims that his sexual liaison with McGruder was the only point in his entire life he had made love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Thanks for the Memory |episode-link=Thanks for the Memory (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=20 September 1988 |season= |series-no=II |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Queeg (Red Dwarf)|Queeg]]" (1988), Rimmer mentions how, after being burnt once by a person he considered his best friend, he had considered no-one in his life to be "true friends", and that friends were only friends when it suits them. He explains that when he was fifteen, he had a "friend", Porky Roebuck, to whom Rimmer believed that Porky's father having an affair with Rimmer's mother proved how close he and Porky were. Porky and Rimmer went on a Space Scouts survival course together, where Porky was the ringleader of a plan to eat Rimmer; Rimmer being tied to a stake and having [[barbecue sauce]] poured on him before he was almost cooked. Lister believes that Porky was "only" bullying Rimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Queeg |episode-link=Queeg (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=4 October 1988 |season= |series-no=II |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Parallel Universe (Red Dwarf)|Parallel Universe]]" (1988) shows Holly's "Holly Hop Drive" trying to get to [[Earth]] within a few seconds. Instead, however, it lands the crew in a female-oriented [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] with another version of ''Red Dwarf''; its crew including a female version of Rimmer called Arlene Rimmer (played by [[Suzanne Bertish]]). Regarding Rimmer as little more than a "discardable sex object", the female Rimmer sexually harasses and gropes Rimmer and tries to [[Hypnosis|hypnotise]] him even after Rimmer shows no interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Parallel Universe |episode-link=Parallel Universe (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=11 October 1988 |season= |series-no=II |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Backwards (Red Dwarf episode)|Backwards]]" (1989), Rimmer facilitates a driving test for the mechanoid [[Kryten]] ([[Robert Llewellyn]]), where Kryten causes the ''[[Red Dwarf spacecraft#Starbug|Starbug 1]]'' shuttle to fall into a time hole. The ship crash lands on Earth in a reality where time runs backwards, leaving Kryten, Rimmer and Holly (now played by [[Hattie Hayridge]]) stranded. Rimmer and Kryten start working as the novelty act "the Sensational Reverse Brothers" and begin to enjoy life in this new reality, but after three weeks, they are fired by a pub manager ([[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]]) for a fight that Rimmer and Kryten only become involved in later that night. Lister and the Cat come to rescue Rimmer, Kryten and Holly in another ''Starbug'' to get back to ''Red Dwarf''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Backwards |episode-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf episode) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 November 1989 |season= |series-no=III |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to backstory in "[[Marooned (Red Dwarf)|Marooned]]" (1989), Rimmer did not lose his [[virginity]] to McGruder, but to a girl Rimmer met at cadet school called Sandra in the back of his brother's car.&lt;ref name="Marooned"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Marooned |episode-link=Marooned (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 November 1989 |season= |series-no=III |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when adapted in the novel ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), it is revealed Rimmer was lying.

In "[[Polymorph (Red Dwarf episode)|Polymorph]]" (1989), Rimmer considers the relationship he had with his brothers to be "close". He mentions that he was the butt of the "occasional" practical joke growing up. Despite varying from apple pie beds and black eye telescopes to hiding a small land mine in Rimmer's [[sandpit]], Rimmer believes that none of this was "sinister". Rimmer says that some considered his mother (played by [[Kalli Greenwood]]) to be cold and aloof, but himself believes that she had no time for fools. Rimmer believes this to be "tragic", because they would otherwise have got on "famously".&lt;ref name="polymorph"/&gt;

In "[[Timeslides]]" (1989), Lister is seen travelling back in time by entering a [[Reversal film|photographic slide]] with mutated developing fluid, and tells his seventeen-year-old self (played by [[Emile Charles]]) how to gain a successful multi-billion-[[Pound sterling|pound]]{{refn|group=note|The "[[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Dollarpound|dollarpound]]" currency would not be mentioned in the series until the following episode "[[The Last Day (Red Dwarf)|The Last Day]]" (1989).&lt;ref name="the last day"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Last Day |episode-link=The Last Day (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=19 December 1989 |season= |series-no=III |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} business empire with fifty-eight houses by inventing the "tension sheet" so that he won't join the Space Corps and get trapped on ''Red Dwarf'' in deep space. By becoming the inventor of the tension sheet and never joining the Space Corps, Lister's entire timeline is altered, causing Kryten to never be rescued and the Cat race to no longer exist. Rimmer is left on his own with Holly, and tries going back further in time to his eight-year-old self's (played by [[Simon Gaffney]]) days in [[boarding school]] so that ''he'' invents the tension sheet. Rimmer unwittingly sets things how they were before by causing the original inventor of the tension sheet—Thickie Holden ([[Stephen McKintosh]]), who is in the same dormroom as Rimmer and overhears Rimmer speaking to his younger self—to become the one who patents the tension sheet, but for reasons unclear to both Holly and Rimmer, Rimmer somehow changes his past so that he is alive back on ''Red Dwarf''. His happiness is short-lived, however, as he dies within minutes anyway after hitting a box containing explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Timeslides |episode-link=Timeslides |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=12 December 1989 |season= |series-no=III |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rimmer is seen in the next episode, "[[The Last Day (Red Dwarf)|The Last Day]]" (1989), once again as a hologram. According to his backstory, Rimmer's parents were "Seventh-day Advent Hoppists", and believed that every Sunday should be spent hopping, because their version of the [[Christian biblical canons|Bible]] had a misprint in [[1 Corinthians 13]] and they had [[Biblical literalism|interpreted this passage literally]]. He mentions that the first time he was [[French kiss]]ed was from his Uncle Frank. He had come into the wrong room and thought Rimmer was his mum.&lt;ref name="the last day"/&gt;

==== 1990s ====
According to Lister in "[[Justice (Red Dwarf)|Justice]]" (1991), before the nuclear accident that killed the crew of ''Red Dwarf'', Rimmer was in charge of "Z Shift", and it occupied his every waking moment. Lister said that Z Shift's most vital responsibility was making sure the vending machines didn't run out of fun size [[Crunchie]] bars.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Justice |episode-link=Justice (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=28 February 1991 |season= |series-no=IV |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Dimension Jump (Red Dwarf episode)|Dimension Jump]]" (1991), an alternate Arnold Rimmer, whose friends call him "Ace", is shown as a successful and heroic test pilot in the Space Corps and commander who crosses dimensions to meet another Rimmer—the hologrammatic Rimmer living on ''Red Dwarf''. Ace's interdimensional ship collides with the ''Starbug'' shuttle, causing it to crash land on an ocean planet. With Lister's help, Ace repairs ''Starbug''{{'}}s starboard engine. After returning to ''Red Dwarf'', Ace decides he can't stay, as he couldn't bear to be near the weaselly Rimmer of this universe. Ace can't return home but decides to explore other realities with "a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet." Ace explains that the diverging point in their lives where Ace gets his big break and Rimmer doesn't is that at the age of seven, Ace went down a year in his class while Rimmer stayed up. Being kept down a year was according to Ace what changed him and made him fight back.&lt;ref name="dimension jump"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Dimension Jump |episode-link=Dimension Jump (Red Dwarf episode) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 March 1991 |season= |series-no=IV |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to "[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]" (1991), Rimmer's only physical presence is a small "light-bee"; a piece of hardware which buzzes around and projects his holographic image.&lt;ref name="meltdown"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Meltdown |episode-link=Meltdown (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1991 |season= |series-no=IV |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been contradicted on a few occasions by his ability to move completely through solid objects such as walls or by the ability of solid objects or living characters to pass completely through Rimmer.&lt;ref name="the end"/&gt;&lt;ref name="balance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Stasis Leak |episode-link=Stasis Leak |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=27 September 1988 |season= |series-no=II |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Demons and Angels]]" (1992), ''Red Dwarf'' is blown up when the beam of a device called the triplicator is put into reverse, putting the engine core into meltdown, while creating a "high" and "low" version of ''Red Dwarf'', complete with their own versions of Rimmer (both played by Barrie). Before the lifespans of both versions of ''Red Dwarf'' expire after an hour, the crew collect pieces of the triplicator from both ''Red Dwarf''s, and restore the original ''Red Dwarf'' by amalgamating the two copies with a rebuilt triplicator. The "high" version of Rimmer has his light-bee crushed by Lister when Lister's "low" self controls Lister into doing this by remote control, while the "low" version disappears with his version of ''Red Dwarf''.&lt;ref name="demons and angels"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Demons and Angels |episode-link=Demons and Angels |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Juliet |last3=May |author-link3=Juliet May |first4=Grant (directors) |last4=Naylor |author-link4=Grant Naylor |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=19 March 1992 |season= |series-no=V |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Back to Reality (Red Dwarf)|Back to Reality]]" (1992), ink from a "despair squid" causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination, with the hallucinations attacking things they each consider "quintessential to [their] self-esteem". In the hallucination, Rimmer believes he is a vagrant with a coat smelling of yak's urine called Billy Doyle, with Lister being his more important half-brother, a totalitarian fascist mass murderer called Sebastian. Kryten also explains that because "Billy" has the same upbringing growing up with "Sebastian", Rimmer couldn't blame his own shortcomings on Rimmer's parents. The four nearly commit suicide together, but a mood stabiliser saves them at the last second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Back to Reality |episode-link=Back to Reality (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Juliet |last3=May |author-link3=Juliet May |first4=Grant (directors) |last4=Naylor |author-link4=Grant Naylor |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=26 March 1992 |season= |series-no=V |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Psirens]]" (1993), Kryten explains that ''Red Dwarf'' was "stolen", with the crew now based inside ''Starbug'' chasing after ''Red Dwarf'' to recover it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Psirens |episode-link=Psirens |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=7 October 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]" (1993), Rimmer encounters a being known as Legion (Nigel Williams), who upgrades Rimmer's projection unit from "soft light" to "hard light", giving him a physical form and the ability to interact directly with the world, in addition to making him virtually indestructible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Legion |episode-link=Legion (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 October 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Emohawk: Polymorph II]]" (1993), an emotion-leeching "emohawk" attacks ''Starbug'' and consumes Rimmer's bitterness, turning him into his "Ace Rimmer" persona. The emohawk is captured, and Lister freezes it with liquid dillinium. The crew plan to extract the emohawk's DNA strands and re-inject Rimmer with them to return his emotions to normal, but the Cat clumsily freezes everyone else before this can be done.&lt;ref name="emohawk"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Emohawk: Polymorph II |episode-link=Emohawk: Polymorph II |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=28 October 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Rimmerworld]]" (1993), Rimmer steals an escape pod locked on course with the nearest habitable planet. Because of the [[time dilation]] caused by the pod going through a [[wormhole]], it takes six hundred years from Rimmer's perspective for ''Starbug'' to catch up with him, even though it's only moments from the point of view of ''Starbug''. In the meantime, using cloning equipment inside the pod, Rimmer uses his DNA to create a society of thousands of Arnold Rimmers (all played by Barrie), who backstab Rimmer and imprison him before Lister, the Cat and Kryten rescue him centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Rimmerworld |episode-link=Rimmerworld |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=4 November 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Out of Time (Red Dwarf)|Out of Time]]" (1993), Rimmer mentions that all trace of ''Red Dwarf'' has been lost. In the episode, a ''Starbug'' from fifteen years hence arrives, with Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten's future selves intending to copy some components from the present ''Starbug''{{'}}s time drive so they can fix the fault in their own drive and continue their lives of opulence, socialising with notorious figures of history such as the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]], the [[House of Borgia|Borgias]], [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Hermann Göring]]. Lister tells the future crew to leave, and the future ''Starbug'' fires upon the present day one, apparently killing the crew and blowing ''Starbug'' up.&lt;ref name="out of time"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Out of Time |episode-link=Out of Time (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |date=11 November 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following episode, "[[Tikka to Ride]]" (1997), Lister mentions in a video log that the future ''Starbug'' destroying the ''Starbug'' of the present meant the time drive they had used ceased to exist in both the present and the future, or in other words, killing the present crew of ''Starbug'' in the present also killed the crew in the future, making it impossible for the future crew from ever going back in time to kill themselves in the present. The Cat later mentions in the episode that time returned to the point before the time drive was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Tikka to Ride |episode-link=Tikka to Ride |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |first2=Ed (director) |last2=Bye |author-link2=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |date=17 January 1997 |season= |series-no=VII |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]" (1997), Rimmer is approached by a dying Ace Rimmer (played by Barrie), who is not the Ace Rimmer which Rimmer had met previously, nor an immediate replacement but a distant successor and a hard light hologram with a damaged light-bee. Ace asks Rimmer to become a defender of the multiverse upon Ace's death.

Because he is resurrected as he was at the time of the accident, he lacks any of the growth that the "other" Rimmer has gone through since the series began, reverting him back to his original persona.

In ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth]]'' (2009), set nine years later, ''Red Dwarf'' is intact; the human race is apparently "virtually extinct" in the universe apart from Lister again; Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten are the only people on board the ship; and Rimmer is shown to be a hard light hologram and the most senior officer on board again; how these have come about and what happened to the micro-organism is not explained. In this special, a female "despair squid", whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called ''Red Dwarf'', and their dimension is "invalid". This leads them to be shown being pulled into the nearest "valid" reality. They confront the "Creator" of ''Red Dwarf'' ([[Richard O'Callaghan]]) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they're hallucinating, and they wake up on board ''Red Dwarf''. Kryten and Rimmer speculate that they were able to choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid.&lt;ref name="back to earth"&gt;{{cite serial |title=Red Dwarf: Back to Earth |title-link=Red Dwarf: Back to Earth |episode= |url= |series= |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |credits= |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |city= |date=10–12 April 2009 |season= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To his surprise, he finds that Howard is, like him, a vending machine repairman who became the superior officer on his ship. In Howard's case this followed an attack by [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Simulants]]. Howard is mortally wounded during a skirmish with the rogue Simulant who killed the crew, Sim.

According to Rimmer's backstory in "[[Lemons (Red Dwarf)|Lemons]]" (2012), Rimmer was given the middle name "Judas" because [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], as characterised by the religious denomination that Rimmer's mother belonged to, the Church of Judas, embodied all of the traits Rimmer's mum wanted him to have. According to the Church of Judas, [[Jesus]] asked Judas, whom the Church believed was Jesus' twin brother, to swap places with him; Judas sacrificing himself and his reputation so that [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus would appear to have been resurrected]] after showing up following [[Crucifixion of Jesus|the crucifixion of Judas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Lemons |episode-link=Lemons (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |city= |date=18 October 2012 |season= |series-no=X |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Beginning (Red Dwarf).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rimmer learns of his true parentage from Lecturer Rimmer's recorded message.]]

In a flashback depicted in "[[The Beginning (Red Dwarf)|The Beginning]]" (2012), Rimmer is shown during his youth (played by [[Philip Labey]]) attending Io [[Institute of technology|Polytechnic]] on [[Io (moon)|Io]], where one of his lecturers covering [[psychological profiling]] is the man he believes is his father, Lecturer Rimmer (now played by [[Simon Treves]]). After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding [[peer pressure]]. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board ''[[Red Dwarf spacecraft#Blue Midget|Blue Midget]]'' being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.

It is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode "Only the Good...". This is a combination of the respective memories of the hologram Rimmer, who later became Ace, and the resurrected Rimmer who faced Death in the Series VIII cliffhanger. However, attempts by Rimmer and Kryten to explain how he saved the ship at the end of that series are interrupted.&lt;ref name="the beginning"/&gt;

In "[[Officer Rimmer]]" (2016), Rimmer is promoted to first lieutenant by a bio-printed copy of Captain Herring ([[Stephen Critchlow]]), when Rimmer saves Herring's ship the ''Nautilus'' by a fluke. He separates ''Red Dwarf'' by instigating a class system, and sets up an officers' club featuring copies of himself (played by Barrie). Rimmer accidentally creates a monstrous amalgamation of Rimmers (also played by Barrie) that absorbs all the other Rimmers apart from the original. Rimmer resigns his rank, again becoming second technician, so he can leave the officers' corridor and get to safety. Lister, Cat and Kryten subsequently kill the monster.&lt;ref name="Officer Rimmer"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Officer Rimmer |episode-link=Officer Rimmer |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=13 October 2016 |season= |series-no=XI |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to backstory in "[[List of Red Dwarf episodes#Red Dwarf XII (2017)|Timewave]]" (2017), when Rimmer was six, his parents sent him to a different prep school, St Tremble's, so he could get his confidence back after being ridiculed every day and [[wedgie]]d every night. According to Rimmer, games were not competitive there, and everyone won a "you're really special" trophy on [[sports day]]. He said that his sex life had been a "shambles" ever since one of Rimmer's brothers told him sex advice at school that the most important thing was the clitoris; Rimmer misheard it as "to spit on her wrist".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Timewave |episode-link=Timewave (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=26 October 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Mechocracy]]" (2017), Kryten is elected president of the machines on ''Red Dwarf'' after running against Rimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Mechocracy |episode-link=Mechocracy |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=2 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=4 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Skipper (Red Dwarf)|Skipper]]" (2017), Rimmer, in search of a fresh start, decides to leave his universe using a quantum skipper that can skip to other universes where he feels less of a loser. In his first jump to a new universe it is the moment just before he causes the radiation leak but, for an unexplained reason, he is a hologram with his old letter 'H' on his forehead when this happened.  After multiple attempts at finding a suitable universe, Rimmer arrives in a universe where he is alive, married and a navigation officer. However, upon discovering Lister is more successful and rich than he is, Rimmer returns to his original universe and breaks the quantum skipper, finding the pain of living in that universe "too much".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Skipper |episode-link=Skipper (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=16 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Novels ===
In ''[[Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' (1989), Rimmer is a First Technician. Rimmer first meets Lister while ''Red Dwarf'' is docked at [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], a moon of [[Saturn]]. There, Rimmer is under the persona of "Officer Christopher Todhunter" and dons a phony admiral uniform and [[fake mustache|false mustache]]. He encounters Lister, who has stolen the Mimas-equivalent of a [[taxi]] known as a 'Hopper' to earn money, and pays him to take him to the [[red-light district]] of the city where Rimmer plans to frequent a droid [[brothel]], while lying and saying he intends to eat at a restaurant.

Unlike in the television series, Rimmer's incompetence does not cause the radiation leak that kills the crew. Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=2 November 1989 |title=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |title-link=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=46 |isbn=0-14-012437-3  |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), similar to the [[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|episode of the same name]], the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive [[virtual reality]] video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's [[subconscious]] desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night, leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.

Following a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.

Imprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), following the attempted kidnapping of the crew by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots, ''Starbug'' is infected with the Armageddon Virus. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable.

In the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Rimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others. As the highest ranking survivor aboard the ship (despite being a hologram), Rimmer often deludes himself into believing that he is in charge and that he has somehow been moulding "his" crew into an effective spacegoing unit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Holoship |episode-link=Holoship |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Juliet (director) |last3=May |author-link3=Juliet May |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=20 February 1992 |season= |series-no=V |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote='''Rimmer:''' Captain, I've been in effective command of Red Dwarf now for nearly four years.

So don't tell me I'm not an officer, Captain, just because in deep space there's no academy around to award me my pips. |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the others tend to take suggestions from Lister or Kryten in a crisis.

Rimmer's poor repair work on the drive plate was responsible for the radiation leak that killed the crew, and Rimmer bore the guilt of this (although he also partly blamed Lister for the accident, as he was unable to help repair the drive plate due to being in stasis at the time).&lt;ref name="the end"/&gt; However, in "[[Justice (Red Dwarf)|Justice]]" (1991), after Rimmer is jailed for over 9000 years for the accident, Kryten successfully argues at his appeal that Rimmer's guilt is misplaced – as a second technician (and one who "couldn't outwit a used teabag"), he could not possibly have been responsible for (and indeed would not have been trusted with) work that might endanger the crew if not performed correctly. Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment. In keeping with his defective personality, Rimmer continually objects to his own defence (despite its effectiveness) on the grounds that he believes he is being portrayed unfairly.&lt;ref name="justice"/&gt;

Rimmer was finally able to live his fantasy of commanding an army in the episode "[[Meltdown (Red Dwarf)|Meltdown]]" (1991), leading an army of "good" wax-droids against a much larger force of "evil" wax-droids. Although Rimmer ultimately succeeds in destroying the opposing army, his forces are completely wiped out when he uses most of them as a diversion and then has Kryten turn up the heating to melt all the droids.&lt;ref name="meltdown"/&gt; In addition to his fondness for militarism,&lt;ref name="Marooned"/&gt; [[elitism]] and [[Hammond organ]] music,&lt;ref name="camille"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Camille |episode-link=Camille (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 February 1991 |season= |series-no=IV |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rimmer also enjoys [[Morris dancing]] and is an authority on [[utility pole|20th century telegraph poles]],&lt;ref name="camille"/&gt; especially those observed while [[train spotting (hobby)|train spotting]].&lt;ref name="dimension jump"/&gt; Rimmer has also been attempting to learn [[Esperanto]] for eight years, but has failed miserably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Kryten |episode-link=Kryten (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=6 September 1988 |season= |series-no=II |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Marooned (Red Dwarf)|Marooned]]" (1989), he reveals he used to play golf and hated people (like Lister) who abused the facilities.

Many episodes of ''Red Dwarf'' focus on the conflict between Rimmer's ego and his neuroses. In "[[Confidence and Paranoia]]" (1988), Rimmer manages to trick Lister into generating a hologram duplicate in order to provide him with a companion;&lt;ref name="confidence"/&gt; however, as a consequence of Rimmer's self-loathing, in the follow-up episode "[[Me²]]" (1988), the two Rimmers are incapable of getting along, and their interaction becomes so bitter and hate-filled that the duplicate must be turned off.&lt;ref name="me squared"/&gt; In "[[Terrorform]]" (1992), a "psi-moon" sculpted to reflect Rimmer's psychological make-up becomes a desolate, swampy hell-hole dominated by Rimmer's Self-Loathing, personified as a sadistic beast, with a metaphysical graveyard marking the "demise" of his various virtuous qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Terrorform |episode-link=Terrorform |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Juliet (director) |last3=May |author-link3=Juliet May |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=5 March 1992 |season= |series-no=V |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his cowardice, and tendency to run from any kind of danger or fight, Rimmer is the member of the crew most willing to kill, preferably in the safest and most cowardly way possible, although, due to a mixture of cowardice, and the fact that for much of the series he cannot physically harm anyone, he seldom manages to. He attempts to coerce Lister to shoot a dangerous [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Simulant]] ([[Nicholas Ball (actor)|Nicholas Ball]]) in the back (bemoaning the fact that said Simulant was currently awake),&lt;ref name="justice"/&gt; suggests shooting Kryten and Lister into space when they appeared on the ship in a timeline where they had been erased from history,&lt;ref name="the inquisitor"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Inquisitor |episode-link=The Inquisitor (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Juliet |last3=May |author-link3=Juliet May |first4=Grant (directors) |last4=Naylor |author-link4=Grant Naylor |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=27 February 1992 |season= |series-no=V |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that he and Kryten eject Lister and Cat from ''Starbug'' when it is revealed that the ship lacks fuel to reach the nearest planet — although this is also prompted by the discovery that the ship only had air for seven minutes and was ended when Rimmer learned that his projection unit only had enough power for four minutes&lt;ref name="demons and angels"/&gt; — and in a despair squid-induced hallucination of 21st century Earth, casually pushes a fellow hologram ([[Sophie Winkleman]]) into traffic after she repeatedly threatens to have him "erased" and claims that hologram-killing is "morally, ethically [...] fine".&lt;ref name="back to earth"/&gt; In "[[List of Red Dwarf episodes#Red Dwarf XI .282016.29|Officer Rimmer]]" (2016), Rimmer deems it better to sacrifice others for the safety of the crew.&lt;ref name="Officer Rimmer"/&gt;

Rimmer's personality flaws are in fact almost completely a result of his hang-ups. An alternative version of Rimmer, [[Red Dwarf characters#Ace Rimmer|Ace Rimmer]], who was kept back a year in school, learned [[humility]] and inner strength and grew up to become a charming and well liked Space Corps [[test pilot]], interstellar [[hero]], and sexual seducer.&lt;ref name="dimension jump"/&gt;

Surprisingly, however, Rimmer is still capable of nobility, honour and love. When ''Red Dwarf'' encounters a holoship with an all-hologram crew composed of the "best and brightest" in the episode "[[Holoship]]" (1991), Rimmer desperately wants to join. A female officer aboard the ship, Nirvanah Crane, played by [[Jane Horrocks]], falls in love with him and sacrifices her place on the ship for Rimmer, only for Rimmer to do the same in return for her. This act of nobility surprises even Rimmer himself.&lt;ref name="holoship"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Holoship |episode-link=Holoship |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Juliet (director) |last3=May |author-link3=Juliet May |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=20 February 1992 |season= |series-no=V |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Out of Time (Red Dwarf)|Out of Time]]" (1993), Rimmer is disgusted by his corrupt future self to the point where he'd rather do battle with him than surrender ("Better dead than [[Smeg (vulgarism)|smeg]]!"), Rimmer later frantically risking his life to save the others after their future selves kill them.&lt;ref name="out of time"/&gt;  In "[[The Beginning (Red Dwarf)|The Beginning]]" (2012), Rimmer is also able to formulate a plan to save the crew from the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Simulant Generals]].&lt;ref name="the beginning"/&gt; Rimmer has also showed the capacity to respect other viewpoints in conflict with his own; in "[[The Last Day (Red Dwarf)|The Last Day]]" (1989), he tries to convince Lister that he should respect Kryten's right to believe in [[Silicon Heaven]] in spite of it conflicting with Lister's own beliefs&lt;ref name="the last day"/&gt; and in "[[Lemons (Red Dwarf)|Lemons]]" (2012), Rimmer was eager to meet [[Jesus]] despite being an [[atheist]]. In "[[Polymorph (Red Dwarf)|Polymorph]]" (1989), Rimmer leads Kryten and Cat in the hunt for the intruder and in "[[Bodyswap]]" (1989), he takes charge of the hunt for ''Red Dwarf's'' self-destruct mechanism. Once Rimmer is sapped of his anger by the Polymorph, he is a conciliatory pacifist wishing to promote peace between the creature and various members of the crew and keen to not hurt anybody's feelings during their discussions.&lt;ref name="polymorph"/&gt; In "[[Backwards (Red Dwarf)|Backwards]]" (1989), he revels in his success as a showbiz performer and extols the virtues of a world without war, famine, crime or death. In "[[Tikka to Ride]]" (1997), Rimmer protests against abusing the Time Drive and chastises Lister for doing so.

==Appearance==
Rimmer's status as a hologram in most episodes of ''Red Dwarf'' is shown by the 'H' on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from the [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], such as "alphabet head" and "[[Goal (sport)#Rugby football|goalpost]] head". Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair&lt;ref name="the inquisitor"/&gt; relatively short, deciding that it makes him feel like more of a man.&lt;ref name="future echoes"/&gt; When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that "every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts" (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head).&lt;ref name="emohawk"/&gt;

Rimmer's Space Corps uniform changes several times during the course of the show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original. In the 2009 three-part special ''Back to Earth'', Rimmer wears a blue suit similar to his Series III and VI green suit but with the addition of a plain waist-high belt worn over the jacket and a quilted collar.&lt;ref name="back to earth"/&gt; From [[Red Dwarf X|Series X]] onward, Rimmer sports a dark blue tunic; lacking the belt and light blue boots of the ''Back to Earth'' outfit.&lt;ref name="Naylor"/&gt;

The 'H' on his forehead also changes from series to series: it starts as a grey colour and a blocky shape, then, in Series III, it becomes bright blue and reflective, and then, in Series V, its shape is changed to a thinner and more stylised font. His 'H' also briefly changes to a reflective red colour set inside a circle when he temporarily joins the holoship SS ''Enlightenment''.&lt;ref name="holoship"/&gt;

==Casting==
[[Image:Arlene Rimmer.jpg|thumb|right|Rimmer encounters his "female opposite" Arlene.]]

Among the actors who auditioned for Rimmer were [[Norman Lovett]] (who went on to play [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] instead), [[David Baddiel]], [[Hugh Laurie]], and [[Alfred Molina]].&lt;ref name="Casting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/guide/index.cfm?sectionID=behind-the-scenes&amp;seriesID=1&amp;subsectionID=casting |title=RedDwarf.co.uk: Series I Casting |accessdate=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Molina was cast as Rimmer,&lt;ref name="Interview: Norman Lovett"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date=November 1992 |title=Interview: Norman Lovett |url= |journal=Red Dwarf Smegazine |publisher=Fleetway Editions Ltd |volume= |issue=#9 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |issn=0965-5603}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End"&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End |url= |journal=Red Dwarf Smegazine |publisher=Fleetway Editions Ltd |volume=2 |issue=#1 |pages= |doi= |access-date= |issn=0965-5603}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the role was recast and filled by [[Chris Barrie]], a professional voice-actor and impressionist.  Barrie, who had originally auditioned for Lister,&lt;ref name="Casting" /&gt; was familiar with [[Rob Grant]] and [[Doug Naylor]] having worked together on ''[[Son of Cliché]]'' and ''[[Spitting Image]]'', and with the producers on ''[[Happy Families (1985 TV series)|Happy Families]]'' and various [[Jasper Carrott]] productions.&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf series 1 Episode One: The End"/&gt; He has appeared in all but four episodes of the show, which he missed in series VII due to scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_7/writing.html |title=RedDwarf.co.uk: Series VII Writing |accessdate=10 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022124350/http://reddwarf.co.uk/deck05/series_7/writing.html |archivedate=22 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Barrie was given an offer to reprise his role, but turned it down for fear of being tied into a restrictive, long-term contract, which is common in American television production.&lt;ref name="Red Dwarf USA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/index.cfm?frameset=deck05/down_time_fs.html&amp;page=red_dwarf_usa.html |title=Down Time: Red Dwarf USA |author=Ellard, Andrew |accessdate=10 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106170424/http://www.reddwarf.co.uk/index.cfm?frameset=deck05%2Fdown_time_fs.html&amp;page=red_dwarf_usa.html |archivedate=6 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Ludolf "Buddy" Ebsen Jr.''' (Also known as '''Frank "Buddy" Ebsen'''{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}; April 2, 1908 – July 6, 2003) was an American actor and dancer whose career spanned seven decades. His most famous role was as [[Jed Clampett]] in the [[Columbia Broadcasting Company|CBS]] television [[sitcom]] ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' (1962&amp;ndash;1971); afterwards he starred as the [[Title role|title character]] in the television detective drama ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'' (1973&amp;ndash;1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Buddy Ebsen, 95; Actor-Dancer Was Jed Clampett of 'Beverly Hillbillies'|work= Los Angeles Times|date=July 8, 2003|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/08/local/me-ebsen8|accessdate=2010-10-06|first=Dennis|last=McLellan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a dancer, Ebsen began his career in ''[[Broadway Melody of 1936]].'' He also appeared as a dancer with child star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Captain January (1936 film)|Captain January]]'' (1936). Ebsen was the original choice for the role of the Tin Man [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]], but fell ill due to the aluminum dust in his makeup and was forced to drop out. He appeared with [[Maureen O'Hara]] in ''[[They Met in Argentina]]'' (1941) and [[June Havoc]] in ''[[Sing Your Worries Away]]'' (1942).  In ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' (1961), he portrayed Doc Golightly, the much older husband of [[Audrey Hepburn]]'s character. Before his starring role in ''The Beverly Hillbillies'', Ebsen had a successful television career, the highlight of which was his role as Davy Crockett's sidekick, George Russell, in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|Davy Crockett]]'' miniseries (1953&amp;ndash;54).

==Early years==
A middle child with four sisters, Buddy Ebsen was born as Christian Ludolf Ebsen Jr., on April 2, 1908, in [[Belleville, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=ny&gt;{{cite news|title=Buddy Ebsen, of 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' Dies at 95|date=8 July 2003|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/08/obituaries/08EBSE.html|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=la&gt;{{cite web|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|title=Buddy Ebsen, 95; Actor-Dancer Was Jed Clampett of 'Beverly Hillbillies'|date=8 July 2003|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/08/local/me-ebsen8|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Christian Ludolf Ebsen Sr., was a [[Danish people|Danish]] choreographer, who once owned a dance studio and was also a physical fitness advocate, before operating a [[natatorium]] for the local school district,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicimages.com/people/article_4e042662-10ab-5fa1-9416-d5ece05f1178.html|title=Buddy Ebsen|publisher=classicimages|date=2006-08-25 |accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Frances (née Wendt),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YkIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tCMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7138,924501&amp;dq=stroke-fatal-to-summer-visitor-rites-are-held&amp;hl=en|
title=Stroke Fatal to Summer Visitor; Rites Are Held|work=The Times-News|date=July 21, 1951 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] (specifically, [[Baltic_Germans#Latvia|Latvian]]) painter. 

Ebsen was raised in Belleville until the age of 10, when his family moved to [[Palm Beach County, Florida]]. In 1920, Ebsen and his family relocated to [[Orlando, Florida]]. Ebsen and his sisters learned to dance at a dance studio his father operated in Orlando.

During his high school years, Ebsen became a member of John M. Cheney Chapter, [[DeMolay International|Order of DeMolay]]. His involvement as a teenager led to his being recognized by DeMolay in adult life with the award of the Legion of Honor Degree, and later by induction into the DeMolay Alumni Hall of Fame.

Ebsen graduated from Orlando High School in 1926. Initially interested in a medical career, Ebsen attended the [[University of Florida]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]], from 1926 to 1927, and then [[Rollins College]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]], from 1927 to 1928. Family financial problems caused by the collapse of the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s|Florida land boom]] forced Ebsen to leave college at age 20.

==Professional career==
Ebsen left Orlando in the summer of 1928 to try his luck as a dancer in [[New York City]], arriving with only $26.75 in his pocket, and worked at a [[soda fountain]] shop. His sister [[Vilma Ebsen]] and he performed as a dance act in [[supper clubs]] and in [[vaudeville]] — they were known as "The Baby Astaires". On [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Ebsens appeared as members of the chorus in the [[musical theatre|musical]]s ''[[Whoopee]]'', ''[[Flying Colors (musical)|Flying Colors]]'', and ''[[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1934]]''. A rave review from New York columnist [[Walter Winchell]], who saw them perform in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], led to a booking at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] in New York City, the pinnacle of the vaudeville world.

===MGM signing===
[[image:Buddy Ebsen1.jpg|right|thumb|Buddy Ebsen c. 1936]]
In 1935, Ebsen and his sister were approached by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] for a [[screen test]]. They then signed a two-year contract, with a two-year option, for $1,500.00 per week each ({{Inflation|US|1500|1935|fmt=eq}}). After relocating to Hollywood, the siblings made their film debuts in the 1935 film ''[[Broadway Melody of 1936]]''. This was to be Vilma's only film — a contract problem prevented her making other films and she soon retired from show business.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Ebsen went on to appear in numerous films, both musicals and nonmusicals, including the 1936 ''[[Born to Dance]]'', the 1936 ''[[Captain January (1936 film)|Captain January]]'' (in which he danced with [[Shirley Temple]]),  the 1938 ''[[Broadway Melody of 1938]]'' (with [[Judy Garland]] as his dance partner), and the 1938 ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (1938 film)|The Girl of the Golden West]]''. Ebsen partnered with actresses [[Eleanor Powell]] and [[Frances Langford]], among others, and also danced solo.

Ebsen was noted for his unusual, surreal dancing and singing style (for example, his contribution to the "Swingin' the Jinx Away" finale of ''[[Born to Dance]]''). His abilities might have been a reason filmmaker [[Walt Disney]] chose Ebsen to be filmed dancing in front of a grid as an aid to animating [[Mickey Mouse]]'s dancing in Disney's 1929 to 1939 [[Silly Symphony|Silly Symphonies]] animated short films.

===''The Wizard of Oz''===
[[File:Buddy Ebsen Tin Man.jpg|right|thumb|Buddy Ebsen as the Tin Man]]
When Ebsen turned down studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s offer of an exclusive MGM contract, Mayer warned him that he would never work in Hollywood again. Nonetheless, MGM did cast Ebsen as the Scarecrow in its 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Ebsen then swapped roles with actor [[Ray Bolger]], who was originally cast as the Tin Man. Bolger wanted to play the Scarecrow, and Ebsen did not object to the change. Ebsen had recorded all of his songs as the  Tin Man, attended all the rehearsals, and began filming. However, he soon began experiencing body aches, muscle cramps and shortness of breath, eventually leading to a lengthy  hospitalization. Doctors determined that Ebsen was suffering a reaction to the [[aluminum]] dust used in the Tin Man makeup and he was forced to leave the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/movies/films/ozebsen.asp |title=Wizard of Oz and Buddy Ebsen |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[SAG-AFTRA]] ''Early Members: 1937'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303061728/http://www.sagaftra.org/early-members-1937|date=March 3, 2016}} ''Frank 'Buddy' Ebsen'': "When I was cast as the original Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz (1939), I almost disappeared over the rainbow because of the poisonous aluminum dust in my silvery make-up. It cost me a big medical bill. If that happened today, the Guild would have taken care of it. SAG, long may they wave."&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview included posthumously on the 2005 DVD release of ''The Wizard of Oz'', Ebsen recalled that the MGM  studio heads did not believe he was ill until he was ordered back to the set, and was intercepted by an angry nurse. Ebsen was replaced by [[Jack Haley]], with the makeup quickly changed to a safer aluminum paste. As noted in a documentary on the 2005 DVD, at the time,  MGM did not publicize the true reason for Ebsen's departure; even Haley was not told until much later. Although Haley re-recorded most of Ebsen's vocals, Ebsen's [[Midwestern]] voice (as opposed to Haley's [[Boston accent|Bostonian]] accent), with the enunciated "r" in the word "wizard", can still be heard on the soundtrack during several reprises of the song "We're Off to See the Wizard". Ebsen's recording of the Tin Man's only solo song, "[[If I Only Had a Brain|If I Only Had a Heart]]", still exists and is included on the two-CD Deluxe Edition of the film's soundtrack, while a still photo recreation of the sequence featuring shots of Ebsen as the Tin Man was included as an extra with all VHS and DVD releases of the film since 1989. For the rest of his life, Ebsen complained of breathing problems from his involvement in "that damned movie".&lt;ref&gt;Cox, Stephen (1988, rev. 2003).

Cumberland House Publishing; Rev Exp edition. {{ISBN|1-58182-302-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, he outlived all of the major cast members of ''The Wizard of Oz'', living into the 21st century; [[Jerry Maren]] (1920–2018), described in various obituaries as the last surviving Munchkin,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/list/ls061321507/ IMDb] lists several actresses who played Munchkin children who may still be alive as of January 2018. The list also includes a few non-Munchkin extras.&lt;/ref&gt; outlived Ebsen by nearly 15 years, and extras are still alive. Other Munchkins have outlived him as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aXNX_bIxnwC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=buddy+ebsen+outlived+the+cast+of+wizard+of+oz&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QpQBl1Dq6y&amp;sig=RH3C0RbVo76sEG4f-VpbbrTjfmI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N6aBVezzMoWogwSc_4CYBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=buddy%20ebsen%20outlived%20the%20cast%20of%20wizard%20of%20oz&amp;f=false|last=Andrews|first=Nigel|title=Nigel Andrews on Jaws: A Bloomsbury Movie Guide|year=1991|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|isbn=9781582340425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
After recovering from the illness, Ebsen became embroiled in a contract dispute with MGM that left him idle for long periods. He took up sailing, eventually becoming so proficient in seamanship that he taught the subject to [[United States Navy]] officer candidates. In 1941, with the start of U.S. involvement in [[World War II]], Ebsen applied several times for an officer's commission in the Navy, but was repeatedly turned down. His application for a [[United States Coast Guard]] commission was accepted, and he was promptly given the rank of [[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]]. This wartime rank was one step up from the rank of [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]], the usual rank given newly appointed naval officers in peacetime. Ebsen served as [[damage control]] officer and later as executive officer on the Coast Guard-manned Navy [[frigate]] {{USS|Pocatello|PF-9|6}}, which recorded weather at its "[[weather station]]" 1,500 miles west of [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. These patrols consisted of 30 days at sea, followed by 10 days in port at Seattle. Ebsen was [[honorably discharged]] from the Coast Guard as a [[lieutenant]] in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;''Stars in Blue'', James E. Wise Jr. and Anne Collier Rehill, Naval Institute Press, 1997, p. 159, {{ISBN|1-55750-937-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to acting===

Ebsen made his television debut on an episode of ''[[The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre]]'' in 1949. This led to television appearances in: ''Stars Over Hollywood'', ''Gruen Guild Playhouse'', four episodes of ''Broadway Television Theatre'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse of Stars]]'', ''Corky and White Shadow'', the [[H.J. Heinz Company]]'s ''[[Studio 57]]'', ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'', two episodes of ''[[Climax!]]'', ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]'', ''[[Playhouse 90]]'', ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'', ''[[Johnny Ringo (TV series)|Johnny Ringo]]'', two episodes of ''[[Bonanza]]'', three episodes of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' (in which he portrayed assorted homicidal villains), and ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]''. Ebsen received wide television exposure when he played Georgie Russel, a role based on a historical person &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Janelle|title=Re: George Russell|url=http://genforum.genealogy.com/russell/messages/12763.html|publisher=genealogy.com|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Archives and Records Administration.

In the 1958–1959 season, Ebsen co-starred in the 26-episode half-hour [[NBC]] television adventure series ''[[Northwest Passage (TV series)|Northwest Passage]]''. This series was a fictionalized account of [[Robert Rogers (soldier)|Major Robert Rogers]], a colonial American fighter for the British in the [[French and Indian War]]. Ebsen played the role of Sergeant Hunk Marriner; [[Keith Larsen]] played Rogers.

In 1960, Ebsen appeared in episodes of the television series ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', in the episodes "The Pitchwagon" and ''[[Tales of Wells Fargo]]'', which he reprised in episodes of both series during 1962 in the roles of different characters.  Also in 1960, Ebsen played in season 4 episode 30 of ''[[Have Gun, Will Travel]]'' called "El Paso Stage", as a corrupt marshal.

From 1961 to 1962, Ebsen had a recurring role as Virge Blessing in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama series ''[[Bus Stop (TV series)|Bus Stop]]'', the story of travelers passing through the bus station and diner in the fictitious town of Sunrise, [[Colorado]]. [[Robert Altman]] directed several episodes. [[Arthur O'Connell]] had played Virge Blessing in the earlier [[Bus Stop (1956 film)|film version]] on which the series was loosely based. Ebsen also appeared as "Mr. Dave" Browne, a homeless [[hobo]], on ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' opposite [[Ron Howard]], and as Jimbo Cobb in'' [[The Twilight Zone]] ''episode "[[The Prime Mover]]" (season 2, episode 21) in 1961.

===''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961)===
Throughout the 1950s, Ebsen performed in films, mainly Westerns. One notable exception was an acclaimed role as Doc Golightly, an older, rural veterinarian deserted by his young wife (played by [[Audrey Hepburn]]) in 1961's ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

===''The Beverly Hillbillies'' (1962–1971)===
[[File:Buddy Ebsen and Irene Ryan from The Beverly Hillbillies - 1970.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Irene Ryan]] and Ebsen, 1970]]

[[Paul Henning]] recalls his reason for choosing Ebsen to play Clampett: "I had seen him on TV and I couldn't imagine anyone else doing the role," he says. "I was fortunate to have him, because he became the cornerstone of the show."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Tom|title=Come Listen To A Story 'bout A Man Named... Buddy, Barnaby &amp; Jed|date=12 February 1995|newspaper= [[Sun-Sentinel]] |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1995-02-12/features/9502080292_1_ebsen-hillbillies-barnaby-jones/3|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebsen became famous as [[Jed Clampett]], an easygoing backwoods mountaineer who strikes oil and moves with his family to [[Beverly Hills, California]], in the long-running, [[Fish out of water (disambiguation)|fish-out-of-water]] CBS sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. Aside from the top-billed Ebsen, principal cast members included [[Irene Ryan]] as Jed's mother-in-law, Daisy Moses, also known as Granny; [[Max Baer Jr.]] as Jed's dimwitted nephew Jethro Bodine; [[Donna Douglas]] as Jed's only child, the curvaceous, critter-loving [[Elly May Clampett]]; [[Raymond Bailey]] as Milburn Drysdale, a bank president who oversees the Clampett fortune; and [[Nancy Kulp]] as Jane Hathaway, Drysdale's secretary.

Although scorned by critics, ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' attracted as many as 60 million viewers between 1962 and 1971 and was several times the highest-rated series on television. The show also spawned similar Paul Henning-produced rural sitcoms such as ''[[Green Acres]]'' and ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', which were eventually linked in crossover episode arcs. ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' was still earning good ratings when it was cancelled by CBS (because programmers [[Rural purge|began shunning shows that attracted a rural audience]]). One episode, "The Giant Jack Rabbit", was the highest-rated half-hour on television to that time and remains{{when|date=July 2013}} the most-watched half-hour sitcom episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Giant Jackrabbit: What is a Beverly Hillbillies Episode Doing on the TV All Time Most Watched List?|publisher=[[The Retroist]]|url=http://www.retroist.com/2012/06/11/the-giant-jackrabbit-what-is-a-beverly-hillbillies-episode-doing-on-the-tv-all-time-most-watched-list/|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all was harmonious among cast members on ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' set, especially between the politically conservative Ebsen and the more liberal Kulp. Said Douglas, "They had a different view, so they had some heated discussions about that. They would go at it for weeks." In 1984, Kulp unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] as a Democrat from [[Pennsylvania]]. To her dismay, Ebsen supported her Republican opponent, incumbent Representative [[Bud Shuster]], going so far as to tape an ad for Shuster that labeled Kulp as "too liberal". Ebsen claimed she was exploiting her celebrity status and did not know the issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Folkart|first=Burt A.|title=Nancy Kulp; Foil in 'Beverly Hillbillies'|date=5 February 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-02-05/news/mn-889_1_beverly-hillbillies|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feudin' Hillbillies: Jed Clampett Opposes Miss Hathaway's House Bid|date=2 November 1984|newspaper=[[The Palm Beach Post]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19841102&amp;id=jqdUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hjsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6266,1161853&amp;hl=en|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Barnaby Jones'' (1973–1980)===
Ebsen returned to television in 1973 as the title character of ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', which proved to be his second long-running television series. Barnaby Jones was a milk-drinking detective who came out of retirement to investigate the death of his son. Critics and CBS executives ridiculed the age of the show's audience, but it lasted 8 seasons and 178 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YUFfn59FaBwC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=barnaby+jones+178+episodes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MzjF3nfIIn&amp;sig=6TSn76rR-KtLuIhf3EuTQIUlDzE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ga-BVZmSEMKjgwTosYGYBw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=barnaby%20jones%20178%20episodes&amp;f=false|last3=Dowell|first3=Gary|last2=Mangus|first2=Don|last1=Halperin|first1=James L.|title=HMM Dallas Music and Entertainment Memorabilia Auction Catalog #688|year=2008|publisher=Heritage Capital Corporation|isbn=9781599672298}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Barnaby Jones'' was cancelled, it was one of the last surviving 1970s detective dramas. [[Lee Meriwether]], 1955 [[Miss America]], played Barnaby's widowed daughter-in-law, Betty Jones. Ebsen appeared briefly as Barnaby Jones on two other productions: a 1975 episode of ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]'' and the 1993 film ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|The Beverly Hillbillies]]''.

Meriwether said of her on and off screen chemistry with Ebsen, "He really worked at being at the top of his game." "You had to keep up with him. I adored him. I think he had feelings for me, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/aug/19/entertainment/la-et-st-lee-meriwether-classic-hollywood-20130819 |title=There she is ....

I was so lucky. He was a dream." "He loved the idea of being a detective. We had CSI-type equipment in the office on the set and he liked doing his own tests.

===Other television credits===

'''Dean A. Grennell''' (November 1, 1923 – April 10, 2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[firearms]] expert, writer/editor, and active [[science fiction]] [[science fiction fandom|fan]]. He was the managing editor of ''Gun World'' magazine and editor of the [[science fiction fanzine]] ''Grue''.

== Background and military service ==
Grennell was born near [[Humboldt, Kansas]], in 1923. His family moved to rural Wisconsin three years later, and he grew up on a [[dairy farming|dairy farm]]. He was a veteran of the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]], where he served as an aerial gunnery instructor during [[World War II]].

== Guns and ammunition ==
After the war, while working as a [[salesman]] for a wholesale [[HVAC]] equipment supplier, he became interested in [[handloading]] cartridges for firearms.&lt;ref name="asprg"/&gt; He eventually became a recognized expert in the firearms field. In the 1950s, he began a long career as a writer on handloading and guns, serving on the staff of various firearms publications. He contributed to such publications as ''[[Gun Digest]]'' and ''Handloaders Digest''. In 1966, he became managing editor of ''Gun World'', working with publisher [[Jack Lewis (screenwriter)|Jack Lewis]]. He served as managing editor of the magazine for more than three decades. As of 2010, ''Gun World'' magazine was still being published.

He was the originator of the [[.45 Super]] pistol cartridge concept and a co-developer of the cartridge.&lt;ref name="super1"/&gt;  The cartridge was later developed by Grennell, along with Tom Ferguson and Ace Hindman (of Ace Custom .45s, in Texas).&lt;ref name="sizg"/&gt; Along with Wes Ugalde of [[Fallon, Nevada]], Grennell was co-developer of the .25 Ugalde [[wildcat cartridge]], (also known as the Thompson/Center Ugalde, or .25 TCU.)&lt;ref name="reload"/&gt; He was also credited as the inventor of the NEXPANDER cartridge reloading tool, which is still in production.&lt;ref name="grayb"/&gt;

== Science fiction fandom ==
In the 1950s, Grennell also began a lifetime of activity in [[science fiction fandom]]. His best-known publication was his fanzine ''Grue'', begun in 1953. The title ''Grue'' ("The Fan's Magazine") was a play on words for the then-popular men's magazine ''[[True (magazine)|True]]'', "The Man's Magazine".&lt;ref name="fanc"/&gt;  In fanzines, Grennell was sometimes called '''dag''', in reference to his initials. He was friends with [[Robert Bloch]], the author of ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''.

==Personal life==
Growing up in [[Brandon, Wisconsin]], Grennell lived in [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Milwaukee]] and [[Germantown, Wisconsin]], and eventually moved to southern California. His wife Jean Grennell died May 29, 1999. They had seven children.&lt;ref name="770a"/&gt; He sometimes signed his letters "Dino".&lt;ref name="zone"/&gt;

'''Deez Nuts''' was a satirical candidate, portrayed by '''Brady C. Olson''', who ran in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]]. His form to run for office was filed with the [[Federal Election Commission]] in late July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fec.gov/fecviewer/CandidateCommitteeDetail.do?candidateCommitteeId=P60009198&amp;tabIndex=3 Details for Candidate ID : P60009198], ''[[Federal Election Commission]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In polls conducted by [[Public Policy Polling]] in [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]] and [[North Carolina]] in mid-August 2015, he polled at 8, 8 and 9 percent respectively, garnering the attention of the media.&lt;ref name="db1"&gt;{{cite web |last=Collins |first=Ben |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/19/presidential-candidate-deez-nuts-does-not-exist.html |title=Presidential Sensation Deez Nuts Is a 15-Year-Old Iowa Farm Boy |date=August 19, 2015 |work=The Daily Beast |accessdate=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Tom. " "I have so many websites" Donald "All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me" Trump grows lead in NC; GOP leads most match ups." Public Policy Polling. Ed. Dean Debnam. Public Policy Polling, 19 Aug. 2015. Web. 22 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2015/08/trump-grows-lead-in-nc-gop-leads-most-match-ups.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2015, Deez Nuts announced on his Facebook page his intention to run for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]], citing his eligibility despite not being a member of the House itself and the scarcity of candidates. A poll performed in mid-August 2016 shows Deez Nuts slightly edging out [[Killing of Harambe|Harambe]] and [[Jill Stein]] in Texas, with 3% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/291759-poll-jill-stein-tied-with-harambe-trailing-deez-nutz-in-texas Poll: Jill Stein tied with Harambe, trailing Deez Nutz in Texas] (16 Aug 2016), ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuts' bid for the presidency drew attention to the number of questionable candidates who had filed to run for office.&lt;ref name="cb1s"&gt;Kaplan, Rebecca (July 28, 2015). [http://www.cbsnews.com/news/deez-nuts-is-running-for-president/ Deez Nuts is running for president], ''[[CBS News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpofang1"&gt;Fang, Marina (August 4, 2015).

It was revealed on August 19, 2015, that "Deez Nuts" is 15-year-old Brady C. Olson of [[Wallingford, Iowa]]. He stated, in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, that he created the practical joke "half-trying to break the two-party system, half-frustration with the front-runners." In addition, Olson also endorsed Vermont Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the Democratic nomination, and Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]] for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickinson|first1=Tim|title=Meet 'Deez Nuts,' the Teen Presidential Candidate Punking America|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/meet-deez-nuts-the-teen-presidential-candidate-punking-america-20150819|accessdate= August 20, 2015|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Olson, according to Section 1 of [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]],&lt;ref name=USConstitution&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html|title=Constitution of the United States, Article 2, Section 1|quote="... neither shall any Person be eligible to [the office of President of the United States of America] who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years ...."|accessdate=2015-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; does not meet the minimum age requirement of 35 years at the time of inauguration to be able to serve as president if elected following the 2016 elections.

In August 2016, the [[Federal Election Commission]] announced its intent to punish future satirical candidates for president for false filings with a federal agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/08/19/fec-cracks-down-on-fake-candidates/88993532/ |title=Federal Election Commission cracks down on Deez Nuts, other fake candidates |last=Schouten |first=Fredreka |date=August 19, 2016 |work=USA TODAY |access-date=June 27, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fec.gov/press/press2016/news_releases/20160818release.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political platform==
Brady Olson, the person behind Deez Nuts, has expressed [[libertarian]] views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Soave|first1=Robby|title=2016 Presidential Candidate Deez Nuts Is (Are?) Libertarian|url=https://reason.com/blog/2015/08/20/2016-presidential-candidate-deez-nuts-is|accessdate=August 23, 2015|publisher=Hit and Run Blog|date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Deez Nuts believes that  [[United States Congress|Congress]] should not be able to spend more than it takes in through [[taxes]]. In order to reinforce the importance of a balanced budget, Nuts believes that, in the short term, Congress, [[President of the United States|the President]], and the [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] should have their salaries slashed in half until the budget is balanced, after which the salaries may slowly rise until they normalize. Nuts believes the salaries should be cut once again if the budget becomes unbalanced.

Nuts also believes that tax incentives are crucial to offer to corporations in order to keep jobs in the United States, as opposed to [[outsourcing]]. Nuts envisions a more self-sufficient United States in the future, not reliant on foreign imports.&lt;ref name="Deez Nuts 2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Deez Nuts for President 2016 Platform|url=http://deeznutsforpresident2016.yolasite.com/Platform.php|accessdate=August 23, 2015|publisher=Deez Nuts 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
Nuts supports cutting subsidies to oil companies and giving tax incentives to individuals and corporations implementing [[renewable energy]] and "green" technology—in particular, he supports grants to communities installing municipal wind turbines, hydroelectric dams, and rooftop solar panels. Nuts has not yet expressed an opinion on nuclear power.&lt;ref name="Deez Nuts 2016"/&gt;

===Immigration===
He considers all adult illegal immigrants violators of the law, believing they should be deported to their country of origin. He has added that the lone exception to this is minors; however, he has not stated the punishment to minors, or the minor's family.&lt;ref name="Deez Nuts 2016"/&gt;

===Social===
Deez Nuts is opposed to the belief that the United States is a [[Christianity|Christian]] nation, and believes in legal [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]] on the basis that each person should be allowed to make his or her own decisions.&lt;ref name="Deez Nuts 2016"/&gt;

===Voting rights===
Deez Nuts believes that residents of [[American overseas territories]] deserve voting rights. He has expressed the need for the people of [[American Samoa]] to become [[citizens of the United States]] and receive one [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]], due to its status as an [[unincorporated territory]] (American Samoans are currently [[U.S. nationals]], but not U.S. citizens). Nuts would give [[Guam]], the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] two electoral votes and give [[Puerto Rico]] three electoral votes, bringing the total number of electoral votes to 548 from 538. Nuts also believes that all five territories and the [[District of Columbia]] should each have their own one voting representation (as opposed to a [[Non-voting members of the United States House of Representatives|non-voting delegates]]) in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], bringing the seats in the House to 441 from 435.&lt;ref name="Deez Nuts 2016"/&gt;

==Endorsements==
Deez Nuts was endorsed by the man behind the original [[The Chronic|'Deez Nuts' skit]], hip-hop artist [[Warren G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collins|first1=Ben|title=Warren G Endorses Deez Nuts for President|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/20/warren-g-endorses-deez-nuts-for-president.html|accessdate=August 20, 2015|publisher=''[[The Daily Beast]]''|date=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice T]] also endorsed Deez Nuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/ice-t-said-everything-tapper-couldnt-during-cnndebate-live-tweets/|title=Ice-T Said Everything Tapper Couldn't During #CNNDebate Live-Tweets|date=17 September 2015|work=mediaite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of his legacy can be seen in the words from the famous folk song "Nicaragua, Nicaraguita" where the words are as follows:

:''Ay Nicaragua, Nicaragüita, la flor más linda de mi querer,''
:''abonada con la bendita, Nicaragüita, sangre de Diriangen.''

:Oh Nicaragua, the most beautiful flower of my love,
:Fertilized with the blessed blood of Diriangen.

'''Elias Molee''' (January 3, 1845 –   September 27, 1928) was an American journalist, [[philologist]] and [[linguist]].

==Background==
Elias Molee was born in [[Muskego, Wisconsin]], the son of John Evenson Molie and Anne Jacobson Einong.  The original spelling of the family name was Molie. His father emigrated from [[Tinn]] in the province of [[Telemark]], [[Norway]] in 1839 and was an early farmer in Muskego.

in 1906, while publishing his second book on teutonish, he lived in [[Tacoma, Washington]].

==Career==
Elias Molee is known as the creator of the language [[Tutonish]]. He also invented a system of shorthand and used only lower case letters (for example, he used "e" in place of "the") and a form of sign language symbols. In his autobiography ''molee's wandering'' (written without capital letters, which he considered "cruel, non-ethical, non-artistic, and non-scientific") he describes an idyllic childhood spent listening to tales of Norse mythology in his family's log cabin, eating "good pancakes with milk in e dough n much egg n butter in it," and roaming the fields picking fresh berries, plums and nuts with the local children.

'''François Rémond''' (c. 1747 – 1812) was a French master metalworker and bronze [[Gilding|gilder]] who achieved renown in his day, and whose work is still greatly valued.  
It included stand-alone works such as candelabras, the decorative casings for clocks and bronze ornamentation for the elaborate furniture made for the elite at the time.

==Life==

François Rémond was born in Paris about 1747, and started his apprenticeship in 1763. In 1774 he became a master in the bronze gilders' guild.
He was a prolific worker.{{sfn|François Rémond: Getty}}  
He became one of the best regarded of bronze gilders, carvers and casters of his time, producing work that was much in demand from the royal court.
He undertook many commissions from the prominent ''[[marchand-mercier]]'' [[Dominique Daguerre]].{{sfn|Sasportas|Vertaldi|2013}}
He created works in the Turkish style, then in vogue, for the royal family of [[Louis XVI of France]] (1754–1793).{{sfn|Nora|2001|p=330}}

Rémond made urns, firedogs and candelabras.
He worked with the bronze caster [[Pierre Gouthière]] on some of his larger works before 1788, when Gouthière went bankrupt.{{sfn|François Rémond: Getty}} 
Both Rémond and Gouthière were known for their ability to create matt and burnished gilding. They would make elaborate gilt-bronze mounts for clocks, furniture or statuary that incorporated imaginary or rare creatures such as camels and ostriches.{{sfn|Gilt Bronze : 1600-1800}}
Rémond also made ornaments and figures for clock makers and furniture mounts for [[ébéniste]]s.{{sfn|François Rémond: Getty}} 
He provided bronze ornamentation for the furniture-maker [[Jean Henri Riesener]] (1734-1806).{{sfn|Jewel-cabinet, c.1787}}

In August 1774 the cabinet-maker [[David Roentgen]], based in the town of [[Neuwied]] on the lower Rhine, met Rémond in Paris.
This was to be the start of a long and productive relationship between the two men.{{sfn|Koeppe|2012|p=25}}
In future, most of Roentgen's pieces were ornamented with bronze from Paris, 
including mounts by Rémond and sometimes sculptural work from artists such as [[Louis-Simon Boizot]].{{sfn|Koeppe|2012|p=31}}
Roentgen sold a rolltop desk to [[Catherine the Great]] in April 1786, decorated in bronze, with a chiming clock. 
The clock incorporates a bronze sculpture and bronze ornamentation made with great skill and artistry by Rémond.{{sfn|Koeppe|2012|p=47}}
In a set of five cabinets that Roentgen made for Catherine between 1786 and 1788 Rémond made the arabesque ornaments on the door panels and bronze medallions of the philosophers [[Cicero]] and [[Plato]].{{sfn|Koeppe|2012|p=48}}

An example of his work is an elaborate Neoclassical chimney-piece held by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], made in 1784 after a design by [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] (1744-1818), with bronze figures representing satyresses sculpted by [[Jean-Joseph Foucou]] (1739-1815). It was commissioned for the Grand Salon Ovale of the Hôtel Thelusson in Paris.
The cheminée is made of Verde di Levanto marble, patinated bronze and gilt bronze. Rémond cast the bronze figures and made the decoration. The frieze is entirely decorated with repeating gilt-bronze ornament.{{sfn|Chimneypiece ... MOMA}}

François Rémond died in Paris in 1812.{{sfn|François Rémond: Getty}}

[[Image:Guy-Jean-Baptiste Target portrait.jpg|thumb|right|Guy-Jean-Baptiste Target]]
'''Gui-Jean-Baptiste Target''' (17 December 1733 – 9 September 1806) was a French lawyer and politician.

==Biography==

Born in [[Paris]], Target was the son of a lawyer, and was himself a lawyer to the [[Parlement of Paris]]. He acquired a great reputation as a lawyer, less by practice in the courts than in a consultative capacity, and served the [[ancien régime]] as member of a committee to revise the civil and criminal laws of the kingdom. He strenuously opposed the "''[[parlement]] Maupeou''", devised by [[René Nicolas Charles Augustin de Maupeou|Chancellor Maupeou]] to replace the old judiciary bodies in 1771, refusing to plead before it, an act that earned him the sobriquet of the "Virgin of the palace".

He was counsel for [[Louis René Edouard, cardinal de Rohan]] in the "[[affair of the diamond necklace]]".

In 1785, he was elected to the [[Académie française]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He contributed to the development of the [[Edict of Tolerance]] signed at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] by [[Louis XVI]] in 1787.

==French Revolution==

In 1789, he was returned as one of the deputies of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] in Paris to the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], and he was instrumental in writing up the [[cahiers de doléances]] of Paris. He went on to support revolutionary measures such as the union of the orders, the suspensive veto, the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]], the last of which he was one of the principal authors.. He was one of many deputies named to the [[French Constitution of 1791#Drafting process|Constitutional Committee]] in September 1789, to replace those conservative members who resigned.  
He presided over the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] 18 January - 2 February 1790.

His excessive obesity, which made him the butt of the Royalist jokes, prevented his practising at the bar for some years before 1789. When [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] invited him to undertake his defence, he excused himself on this ground. In 1792, he published some [[constitution]]al observations in extenuation of the king's actions, which, in the circumstances of the time, would have taken some courage.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==From Thermidor to Empire==

Target took no part in public affairs during the [[Reign of Terror]]. Under the [[French Directory|Directory]] he was made a member of the [[Institut de France]] in 1796 and of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] in 1798. He lived to collaborate in the earlier stages of the [[Napoleonic Code|new criminal code]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

== Works ==

Among his writings may be mentioned a paper on the grain trade (1776) and a ''Mémoire sur l'état des Protestants en France'' (1787), in which he pleaded for the restoration of civil rights to [[Protestants]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

== Names ==
One of the oldest references ''Cenabî History'' gives her name as ''Ayşe Hatun''. According to ''Sicill-i Osmanî'' her name is ''Gülbahar Hatun,'' while ''Alderson'' gives her name as ''Ayşe Hatun,'' as well.&lt;ref name="Gül-Bahar"/&gt;

== Origins ==
Gülbahar Hatun and Ayşe Hatun were never different women. The theory of Gülbahar Hatun's origins make her a different woman from Ayşe Hatun as both women had same maiden name, ''Ayşe'' in both the origins and were also married in the same year. The theories of her background are:

* The Ottoman inscription (vakfiye) describes her as ''Hātun binti Abd-us-Samed (Daughter of Abd-us-Samed)'',&lt;ref name="gülbahar"/&gt; which supports the widespread view that her father was a [[Pontic Greek]] who had "turned Turk", that is converted to Islam and joined the Turkish [[Millet]]. ''Abd-us-Samed'', meaning ''Servant of God'', was the [[anonym]] that was applied to many Balkan and Anatolian Christians who converted to Islam in the classical Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="ArchiveTurkey13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enfal.de/otarih44.htm|title=Consorts Of Ottoman Sultans (in Turkish)|publisher = Ottoman Web Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Dolphin Alderson|title=The Structure of the Ottoman Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=Wj64AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Structure+of+the+Ottoman+Dynasty&amp;dq=The+Structure+of+the+Ottoman+Dynasty&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|year=1956|publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin described above is also described for [[Emine Gülbahar Hatun]], wife of [[Mehmed the Conqueror]], mother of Sultan [[Bayezid II]] and the grandmother of Sultan [[Selim I]]. The origin described below is the most acceptable origin of Gülbahar Hatun.

* According to this origin (most sources have claimed that) she was the daughter of ''Alaüddevle Bozkurt Bey'', the eleventh ruler of the [[Dulkadirids]] centered around [[Elbistan]] in ''[[Kahramanmaraş]]''. Her real name was Ayşe&lt;ref name="ayşe"/&gt; and was renamed Gülbahar after her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Hoffman family''' of [[New York (state)|New York]] is a prominent family whose ancestor Martin Hoffman was born in Reval (now [[Tallinn]]), then the capital of [[Estonia under Swedish rule|Swedish Estonia]]. He emigrated to the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]] in 1657. Among his descendants were Governor of New York [[John T. Hoffman]], Congressman [[Ogden Hoffman]], New York Attorney General [[Josiah Ogden Hoffman]], State Senator [[Anthony Hoffman]], several clergymen of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

'''John William Scott''' "'''Ian'''" '''Cassels''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (11 July 1922 &amp;ndash; 27 July 2015&lt;ref&gt;https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;b55dbdac.1508&lt;/ref&gt;) was a British mathematician.

==Biography==
Cassels was educated at Neville's Cross Council School in [[Durham, England|Durham]] and [[George Heriot's School]] in Edinburgh. He went on to study at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and graduated with an undergraduate [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] (MA) degree in 1943.

His academic career was interrupted in [[World War II]] when he was involved in [[cryptography]] at [[Bletchley Park]]. After the war he became a research student of [[Louis Mordell]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]; he received his PhD in 1949 and was elected a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellow]] of Trinity in the same year.

Cassels then spent a year lecturing in mathematics at the [[University of Manchester]] before returning to Cambridge as a lecturer in 1950. He was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Arithmetic in 1963, the same year he was elected as a fellow of the [[Royal Society of London]]. In 1967 he was appointed as [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics]] at Cambridge. In 1969 he became Head of the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics]]. He retired in 1984.

==Mathematical work==
He initially worked on [[elliptic curve]]s. After a period when he worked on [[geometry of numbers]] and [[diophantine approximation]], he returned in the later 1950s to the arithmetic of elliptic curves, writing a series of papers connecting the [[Selmer group]] with [[Galois cohomology]] and laying some of the foundations of the modern theory of [[infinite descent]]{{cn|date=July 2016}}. His best-known single result may be the proof that the [[Tate-Shafarevich group]], if it is finite, must have order that is a square; the proof being by construction of an [[alternating form]].

Cassels often studied individual [[Diophantine equation]]s by [[algebraic number theory]] and [[p-adic methods]].

His publications include 200 papers. His advanced textbooks have influenced generations of mathematicians; some of Cassels's books have remained in print for decades.

'''James Richard Haskell''' was an [[United States|American]] inventor chiefly remembered for his invention (with [[Azel S. Lyman]]) of a multi-charge gun which was intended to increase muzzle velocity by detonating additional propellant charges behind the projectile or shell as it moved up the gun's barrel and was a distant ancestor of the [[World War II]] [[Germany|German]] [[V-3 cannon|V-3]] "supergun".

In 1854 Haskell began experiments with steel [[breech-loading]] [[rifled]] cannon and breech-loading small-arms, manufacturing 25 of the former, which were purchased by the [[Mexico|Mexican]] Government.

In 1855 he began experimenting with multi-charge guns in partnership with Azel S. Lyman, who originated the idea of applying successive charges of gunpowder to accelerate the velocity of a projectile.

==Rafael Repeater==
In 1862, with a French inventor named George Raphael (sometimes reported as Rafael), a supplier of revolvers and swords to the Union army, Haskell invented and constructed a rapid-firing [[machine gun]] which became known as the [[Rafael Repeater]]. It was mounted on a light artillery carriage and fired standard rifle bullets. Unlike contemporary machine-guns, it did not use a feed hopper or separate cartridge chambers. However, few details remain of how it worked, apart from a mention in a letter from [[John Ericsson]]:&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''By a simple application of transverse reciprocating movements, exact and definite, the cartridge chamber is brought in line with the barrel, a perfectly tight joint being formed without any sliding movement across the joint of junction. Abrasion and wear are thereby prevented. The mode of filling and applying the sliding cartridge chamber is certain and free from all danger.''}}

Rafael secured a meeting with Abraham Lincoln thanks to a letter of introduction from New York governor [[Edwin D. Morgan]] and in turn Lincoln arranged that the gun be tested by [[John A. Dahlgren]] who did so at the Navy Yard, discovering that the gun's range and accuracy were remarkable. At a range of {{convert|1800|yd|abbr=on}}, the lateral deviation was described as "very slight", and "nearly all" of 16 shots fired at a target at {{convert|600|yd|abbr=on}} were hits. As far as rate of fire went, the gun fired 40 shots in 20 seconds. John Ericsson was impressed, and wrote to Lincoln that

{{quote|''One regiment of intelligent men provided with one hundred of these effective weapons can most assuredly defeat and destroy a four-fold number of enemies.''&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Repeater was tested in April 1863 at the 6th Corps headquarters in Virginia and was praised by a board composed of two Brigadier-Generals and a Colonel. In their report they stated that they found its simple construction, accuracy, range and rate of fire exactly as had been claimed for it and recommended that initially eight to twelve guns be used per brigade. Brigadier General Pratt, whose experience in action with the [[Gatling gun]] had not been satisfactory, endorsed the Rafael Repeater in glowing terms and asked that at least 24 of them be issued to his division.

After reading the report, [[Abraham Lincoln]] asked the [[Secretary of War]] to refer it to the [[Bureau of Ordnance]]. However, [[James Wolfe Ripley|General James Wolfe Ripley]], who was notorious for delaying the introduction of repeating rifles, did not buy a single example of the gun.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-charge gun==
Haskell and Lyman reasoned that subsidiary propellant charges, spaced at intervals up the barrel of a gun in side chambers and ignited an instant after a shell had passed them, could increase the muzzle velocity of a projectile. The result, the "Lyman-Haskell multi-charge gun", which they constructed on the instructions of the US Army's Chief of Ordnance, did not resemble a conventional artillery piece; the barrel was so long that it had to be laid on an inclined ramp, and it had pairs of chambers angled back at 45 degrees let into it. It was test fired at the Frankfort Arsenal at [[Philadelphia]] in 1880 and was unsuccessful; due to faulty [[obturation]], the flash from the original propellant charge bypassed the projectile and prematurely ignited the subsidiary charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Report of the Chief of Ordnance to the Secretary of War | publisher = | year = 1884 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best velocity that could be obtained from it was {{convert|335|m/s|ft/s}}, much worse than a conventional [[Armstrong Gun]] of the same period. Lyman and Haskell abandoned the idea, though it was apparently briefly raised again in Britain during [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=wood&gt;{{cite book | last = Wood | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=Roger Ford | title = Germany's Secret Weapons in World War II | publisher = Zenith Imprint | year = 2000 | location = | pages = 117–119 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7603-0847-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel Haskell died at his home in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] on August 16, 1897.

'''Jimmy Demers''' is an American [[singer-songwriter]], best known as "the original voice" of the "[[Always Coca-Cola]]" ad campaign. He is a contributor to ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.

Demers was born and raised in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], Massachusetts. He moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music and was soon one of the first artists signed by John McClain to [[Interscope Records]]. Throughout the 1990s, Demers recorded [[jingle]]s for many high-profile clients, including [[Chevrolet]], [[AOL]], [[McDonald's]] and the groundbreaking worldwide campaign of "Always Coca-Cola". He was a member of an R&amp;B/pop group, Truth Inc.
 
Demers has traveled widely, singing in, among other venues, [[Shanghai]], where he performed at the closing ceremonies for the [[Special Olympics World Summer Games]], and [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]]. He has been a featured singer to sports organizations in the United States and has sung the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|U.S. national anthem]] at the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]], [[Dodger Stadium]] and [[Chase Field]].

Shortly after the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], Demers, along with other celebrities and high-profile supporters, went to [[Kuala Lumpur]] to lend his support to the Force of Nature concert for [[Tsunami Aid]]. While in Kuala Lumpur, Demers sang for the King and Queen of [[Malaysia]] at the Royal Palace.

Demers has worked with music industry figures [[Diane Warren]], [[David Foster]], [[Giorgio Moroder]] and [[Tim Rice]]. He has recorded back-up vocals for many artists, including [[Garth Brooks]], [[Patti LaBelle]] and [[Cher]]. His debut album ''Dream A Little'', produced by [[Terry Coffey]] for the [[Concord Music Group]] was released to critical praise. His brother [[Donnie Demers]] wrote the words and music to several of the songs, including "It's A Lonely World" (which was featured on the Sirius radio show of author [[Deepak Chopra]].)

[[Paula Abdul]] has referred to Demers as "the greatest male vocalist in the world" and hosted ''An evening with Jimmy Demers'' in Los Angeles. A&amp;M Record's co-founder [[Herb Alpert]], Billie Dee Williams and model [[Cheryl Tiegs]] were among those who joined Abdul as Jimmy and Donnie performed to a capacity audience.

Demers has headlined sold-out shows at the [[Oak Room (Algonquin Hotel)|Oak Room]] at the [[Algonquin Hotel]] and Lowes Regency Hotel in New York City. He performed at the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in Oxford, England, with Donnie Demers, for The Skoll World Forum Awards.

Demers currently resides in California. He practices [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Demers|first1=Jimmy|title=Do Yourself a Favor – Meditate!|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jimmy-demers/do-yourself-a-favor-medit_b_617704.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hugh Edrich''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 21 June 1937) is a former English [[first-class cricket]]er who, during a career that ran from 1956 to 1978, was considered one of the best batsmen of his generation.&lt;ref name="Cap"&gt;{{cite book |title=If The Cap Fits |last=Bateman |first=Colin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Tony Williams Publications |location= |isbn=1-869833-21-X |pages=60–61 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Born in [[Blofield]], [[Norfolk]], Edrich came from a cricketing family, his four cousins, [[Eric Edrich]], [[Bill Edrich]], [[Geoff Edrich]] and [[Brian Edrich]], all having played first-class cricket.&lt;ref name="Cap"/&gt; He was educated at the private Bracondale School between the ages of eight and seventeen, during which time he played cricket at weekends and was coached by former cricketer [[Cecil Boswell|C. S. R. Boswell]].

Edrich played for [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and [[England cricket team|England]]. He was renowned for playing the cut, the cover drive and scoring off his legs, earning over the years a reputation for dogged fearlessness. His statistical achievements show that he was amongst the best players of his generation, playing a total of seventy-seven [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for England between 1963 and 1976, and scoring a triple-century in 1965 that is the fifth highest Test score for England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?class=1;id=1;type=team | title=Records / England / Test matches / High scores | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A player during the time when [[One Day International]] cricket was in its infancy, he played, and top scored, in the first ever ODI match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/284257.html | title=Records / One-Day Internationals / Batting records / Most runs in an innings (progressive record holder) | publisher=ESPN CricInfo | accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cricket writer Colin Bateman described him as "unflinching, unselfish, and often unsmiling while going about his business in the middle, he was a fiercely formidable opener who knew his limitations and worked wonderfully within them".&lt;ref name="Cap"/&gt;

==Life and career==
Having played four first-class matches for [[Combined Services]] in 1956 and 1957, whilst doing his [[National Service#National service in the United Kingdom|national service]], Edrich made his first-class debut for [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] in their final fixture of the 1958 season. The following year, he came to the fore, scoring 1,799 runs at an average of 52.91. Over the next four years he and [[Micky Stewart]] became a very effective opening partnership for the county, to the extent that both were called up for England for the Test series against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], who were dominating the sport at this time. Despite Edrich's strong performances for his county, he managed a total of only 108 Test runs in six innings facing bowlers including [[Wes Hall|Hall]], [[Garfield Sobers|Sobers]] and [[Charlie Griffith|Griffith]].

However, an opportunity to break back into the international side arose when [[Geoffrey Boycott]] was injured during [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]'s tour of England in 1964. Edrich was called up to the side for the Second Test, at [[Lord's]], and did not disappoint, scoring 120. The match ended in a draw due to rain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/154875.html Cricketer of the Year], [[CricInfo]]. Retrieved on 10 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not selected for the 1964–65 tour of South Africa.

Injuries to other players resulted in another recall to the England side for the Third Test against [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in July 1965, where he scored 310 not out.&lt;ref name="Cap"/&gt; This innings spanned over eight hours, and included 52 fours and five sixes – 238 runs or 77% of his innings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/128733.html Edrich's epoch] [[CricInfo]]. Retrieved on 8 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators{{Who|date=April 2011}} at the time said that he might have broken the existing Test record of 365 within another 90 minutes or so if his captain, [[M. J. K. Smith|Mike Smith]], had not felt it necessary to declare the innings closed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} However, a week later during the First Test against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]], he suffered a blow to the head from a short-pitched delivery by [[Peter Pollock]]. This was before helmets came into use, and he was forced to retire hurt on 7 not out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/12490.html John Edrich's Cricket profile] [[CricInfo]]. Retrieved on 29 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]] named Edrich as [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year|Cricketer of the Year]] in 1966 for his achievements in 1965, alongside [[Colin Bland]], [[Dick Motz]], [[Graeme Pollock]] and brother [[Peter Pollock]]. As well as his Test triple century, he had scored a total of 2,319 runs at an average of 62.67 during the season, including eight hundreds. At one stage, in nine successive innings he scored 139, 121*, 205*, 55, 96, 188, 92, 105 and 310*. Not previously known as a big hitter, he struck forty-nine sixes during the course of the season.
[[Image:John Edrich Graph.png|left|thumb|350px|John Edrich's Test career performance graph]]

He had by now become an established member of the England batting line-up, rarely omitted unless injured. Beginning with the [[1965–66 Ashes series]], he sometimes batted at number three rather than, as hitherto, opening the innings. In the [[1970–71 Ashes series]] his 687 runs (52.85) kept him at the crease for 33 hours and 26 minutes, a record for a Test series until broken by [[Glenn Turner]] against West Indies the next season. His form at this time helped England play 27 consecutive Tests without defeat in 1968–71, and lose only one Test out of 40 in 1966–71.

Edrich played in the first-ever [[One Day International]] (ODI), on 5 January 1971 against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]]. After the Third Test had been called off due to rain, the umpires called for an unscheduled match, consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Edrich top-scored with 82 runs, thus scoring the first half-century in an ODI, and won the first [[Man of the Match]] award in ODI history.

The following summer, Surrey won the [[County Championship]] for the first time since 1958, with Edrich's batting being an important factor in the county's success. By now, Stewart had dropped down the order to number three, and Edrich had formed another successful opening partnership with [[Mike Edwards (cricketer)|Mike Edwards]]. Stewart retired after the 1972 season, and from 1973 to 1977 Edrich succeeded him as Surrey's captain.

On the tour of Australia in 1974–75, his fortune regarding injuries did not improve. In the first [[Test cricket|Test]] a ball from aggressive pace bowler [[Dennis Lillee]] struck his hand and broke it, although he was able to continue batting. In the Fourth Test, the then [[Captain (cricket)|captain]] [[Mike Denness]] dropped himself and Edrich was subsequently named as captain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/england/content/story/222039.html "The Captain Who Dropped Himself]" [[CricInfo]].

'''John Graham Lake''' (March 18, 1870 &amp;ndash; September 16, 1935) was a Canadian-American leader in the [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] movement that began in the early 20th century, and is known as a [[faith healing|faith healer]], [[evangelism|missionary]], and with [[Thomas Hezmalhalch]], co-founder of the [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]]. Through his 1908–13 African missionary work, Lake played a decisive role in the spread of [[Pentecostalism in South Africa]], the most successful southern African religious movement of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="DevilWhoHeals"/&gt;{{rp|98}}&lt;ref name="AzusaAfrica"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.decadeofpentecost.org/ebooks/Azusa-English.pdf | title=From Azusa to Africa to the Nations | publisher=Assemblies of God World Missions: Africa Office, Acts in Africa Initiative | author=Miller, Denzil R. | year=2005 | location=Springfield, MO | isbn=1-8911-1034-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} After completing his missionary work in Africa, Lake evangelized for 20 years, primarily along the west coast of the United States setting up "healing rooms" and healing campaigns, and establishing churches. Lake was influenced by the healing ministry of [[John Alexander Dowie]] and the ministry of [[Charles Parham]].&lt;ref name="JGLM"/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Lake was born in St. Mary's, Ontario, Canada and moved to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan with his family in 1886.&lt;ref name="Apostle"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Lindsay, Gordon|title=John G. Lake–Apostle to Africa|year=1997|publisher=Christ for the Nations, Inc|isbn=978-0899850115}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born into a large family of 16 siblings (eight of whom died young).&lt;ref&gt;B. Morton, [https://www.academia.edu/7005594/John_G_Lakes_Formative_Years_1870-1908_The_Making_of_A_Con_Man "John G Lake's Formative Years 1870-1908"], May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  He graduated from high school in St Mary's shortly before the move to Michigan, and claimed to have been ordained into the Methodist ministry at the age of twenty-one.&lt;ref name="Apostle"/&gt; The seminary he claimed to have attended, though, never existed,&lt;ref name="Burpeau" /&gt;{{rp|53}} and census records show he had less than ten years' education.&lt;ref&gt;US Census 1900 Michigan, Chippewa, Sault Ste Marie, Ward 02, District 0020, entry for John G Lake.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake, then, had no formal theological training.

Lake moved to a suburb of Chicago, Harvey, in 1890, where he worked as a roofer and construction worker before returning to his hometown in 1896. According to Lake, he became an industrious businessman and started two newspapers, the ''Harvey Citizen'' in [[Harvey, Illinois]] and the ''Soo Times'' in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan]],&lt;ref name="Apostle"/&gt; before beginning a successful career in real estate, and later, becoming a millionaire in life insurance dealings. Historian Barry Morton found no evidence that Lake ever owned the two newspapers, citing sources which indicate the ''Harvey Citizen'' was founded by the Harvey township,&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/townofharveyilli00harv | title=The Town of Harvey, Illinois: Manufacturing Suburb of Chicago aged two years | publisher=Harvey Land Association | year=1892 | location=Harvey, Illinois }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Soo Times'' was started by George A. Ferris and owned by Ferris &amp; Scott Publishers.&lt;ref name="DevilWhoHeals" /&gt;{{rp|103}}&lt;ref name="AyerAndSon"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc9236/m1/394/ | title=N.

In February 1893, Lake married Jennie Stevens of Newberry, Michigan, and the two had six children and adopted another before her death in 1908. During the 1890s Lake and many members of his family began appearing regularly in Dowie's services, where they were invariably healed and allegedly brought back from death's door. In 1898 Lake opened a small chapter of Dowie's Christian Catholic Church in Sault Ste Marie and held meetings in the attic of his parents' home. In 1901 he relocated his family to [[Zion, Illinois]], where he worked in the theocratic town's construction department.

After massive retrenchments affected ever-bankrupt Zion City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Chicago Inter-Ocean|date=7 February 1904|title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake found new employment around 1905. He later claimed that he maintained relationships with many of the leading figures of his day including railroad tycoon [[James Jerome Hill]], [[Cecil Rhodes]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=John G.

Lake's biographer, Burpeau, reported no evidence outside of Lake's own assertions that Lake was connected to these wealthy financiers and industrialists.&lt;ref name="Burpeau"&gt;{{cite book | title=God's Showman: A Historical Study of John G. Lake and South Africa/American Pentecostalism | publisher=Refleks Publishing | author=Burpeau, Kemp Pendleton | year=2004 | location=Oslo | isbn=978-82-996599-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morton, contemporary records show Lake never left Zion City at the time Lake was said to be making his name in Chicago; he instead worked in nearby [[Waukegan, IL|Waukegan]] as an "ordinary, small-town insurance salesman". Lake does not appear in contemporary newspapers until 1907 where he gave an account of his experience of speaking in tongues.&lt;ref name="DevilWhoHeals" /&gt;{{rp|105}}
In 1907 Lake was converted to Pentecostalism when [[Charles Parham]] staged a tent revival in Zion in an attempt to woo Dowie's supporters. After Parham's departure a group of several hundred "Parhamites" remained in Zion, led by Thomas Hezmalhalch—a recent arrival from the [[Azusa Street Revival]]. As 1907 wore on, Lake grew in stature among this group, and was usually listed as co-leader. After Parham's arrest for (unsubstantiated) reports of sodomy and pedophilia in the summer of 1907, the Parhamites descended into disorganization. Believing that many had been possessed by demons, a number of brutal [[Exorcism in Christianity#Pentecostalism|exorcisms]] began, in which at least two deaths occurred.&lt;ref name="IndianapolisNews"&gt;{{cite news|title = Confesses death is due to devil cure|newspaper = [[Indianapolis Star]]|date = 21 September 1907|url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/indystar/doc/755743573.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Sep+21%2C+1907&amp;author=&amp;pub=Indianapolis+Star+%281907-1922%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=CONFESSES+DEATH+IS+DUE+TO+DEVIL+CURE|quote = Laboring under a religious frenzy and believing their manipulations would drive out the devils and bring health to Mrs. Letitia Greenhaulgh, aged 64 years and a cripple for twenty years, five members of the sect of Parhamites are under arrest at Zion City, accused of torturing...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = [[Chicago Daily Tribune]]|date = 21 September 1907|url = http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1907/09/21/page/1/article/tortured-in-rite-of-fanatics-dies|title = Tortured in rite of fanatics; dies|page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of arrests and potential mob violence, the Parhamites were forced to flee en masse from Illinois. Lake and Hezmalhalch left for Indianapolis. Once there, they raised $2000 to finance a Pentecostal mission to South Africa.

==Missionary work in Africa==
With [[Thomas Hezmalhalch]], Lake founded the [[Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa]] (AFM) in 1908 and carried on missionary work from 1908-13. Lake and Hezmalhalch would appear to be the first Pentecostal missionaries to South Africa, and introduced speaking in tongues. Many of those who joined their church had previously been Zionists allied to Dowie's organization who believed in [[faith healing]]. Morton writes,&lt;ref name="DevilWhoHeals"/&gt;{{rp|98}} "Lake was instrumental in spreading this fusion of Zionism/Pentecotalismas that is unique to southern Africa... about half of southern African Christians today [2012] are adherents of it... Lake played a decisive role in the spreading of this 'second evangelization'." Lake's movement attracted many of the early [[Zionist Churches|Zionists]] led by Pieter L. Le Roux of [[Wakkerstroom]].&lt;ref name="AFM"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMcDEYRbEaMC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The History of Apostolic Faith Mission and Other Pentecostal Missions in South Africa | publisher=Authorhouse | author=Chandomba, Lyton | year=2007 | isbn=978-1425997397}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} Due to the segregationist impulses of the AFM's white membership,&lt;ref name="deWet"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=de Wet|first=Christiaan R.|title=The Apostolic Faith Mission in Africa, 1908-1960: A Case Study in Church Growth in a Segregated Society|date=1989|type=Ph.D.|publisher=[[University of Cape Town]]|page=Chapters 3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the majority of its African members eventually seceded, forming many different [[Zionist Churches|Zionist Christian sects]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Just six months after Lake's arrival in South Africa, his first wife, Jennie, died on December 22, 1908.&lt;ref name="JGLM" /&gt; Lake recorded that she died of a stroke. He continued his work in Africa for another four years, raising his seven children with the help of his sister Irene.&lt;ref name="JGLM" /&gt;

Lake's ministry in South Africa was not without controversy. Morton wrote&lt;ref name="DevilWhoHeals"/&gt;{{rp|114–15}} that Lake was accused of: misappropriating the AFM's funds, particularly that funds did not flow to poor rural areas but were concentrated with Lake and his party; acting dictatorially; exaggerating the effectiveness of the revival movement he led; and staging miraculous healings through audience plants. He also wrote that "an analysis of the missionary career of John G Lake shows that the initial spread of Pentecostalism and Zionism in southern Africa was facilitated by the systematic use of fraud and deception." &lt;ref name="DevilWhoHeals" /&gt;{{rp|98}}

==Later life and religious work==
Lake returned to America on February 1, 1913, and married Florence Switzer in November 1913.&lt;ref name="JGLM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jglm.org/?page_id=130 | title=Who Was John G. Lake | publisher=John G. Lake Ministries | accessdate=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake's comment{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} on this second marriage was, "Men in these days consider themselves to be happily married once. I have been especially blessed in that I have been happily married twice." From this marriage five children were born.

After a year of itinerant preaching, Lake relocated to [[Spokane, WA]] by July 1914 and began ministering in "The Church of Truth". He started an organization called The Divine Healing Institute and opened what he called "Lake's Divine Healing Rooms". Lake ran the "healing rooms" from 1915 until May 1920, at which time he moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], for a similar ministry that lasted for another five years. He continued to found churches and "healing rooms" down the California coast and eventually to Houston, TX in 1927, before finally returning to Spokane in 1931. Upon his return to Spokane he purchased an old church and began his final church and healing room.&lt;ref name="JGLM"/&gt;

In 1935, Lake suffered a serious stroke{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} and died on September 16, 1935,&lt;ref name="JGLM"/&gt; at age 65.

==Legacy==
Several books have been written recording Lake's experiences and the miracles attributed to Lake.

Lake's history has served as a guide to other ministries, such as Curry R. Blake's "John G. Lake Ministries," based in Dallas, TX, (www.jglm.org) and [[Healing Rooms]] Ministries, led by Cal Pierce, headquartered in Spokane, Washington.

In 1987, Wilford Reidt (the son-in-law of Lake) and his wife, Gertrude (Lake's daughter) passed the leadership of their ministry to Curry R. Blake. Blake was named the General Overseer of the International Apostolic Council, an organization founded by John G. Lake in 1914. Today, the ministry establishes "John G. Lake Healing Rooms" and trains Christians in divine healing.

In 1999, the Healing Rooms in Spokane, Washington were opened, which are not affiliated with John G. Lake Ministries. The Healing Rooms place an emphasis on not only serving the city of Spokane, but in duplicating the ministry of healing globally, with currently 2,002 Healing Rooms in 58 nations.

'''John Rutledge''' (September 17, 1739 – July 23, 1800) was an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and also its second [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]]. Additionally, he served as the first [[Governor of South Carolina]] after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Rutledge established a legal career after studying at [[Middle Temple]] in the [[City of London]]. He was the elder brother of [[Edward Rutledge]], a signatory of the Declaration of Independence. Rutledge served as a delegate to the [[Stamp Act Congress]], which protested taxes imposed on the [[Thirteen Colonies]] by the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. He also served as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]] before being elected as Governor of South Carolina. He served as governor during much of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

After briefly returning to Congress, Rutledge was appointed to the South Carolina Court of Chancery. He was a delegate to the 1787 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Philadelphia Convention]], which wrote the [[United States Constitution]]. During the convention, he served as Chairman of the [[Committee of Detail]], which produced the first full draft of the Constitution. The following year he also participated in the South Carolina convention to ratify Constitution.

In 1789, President [[George Washington]] appointed Rutledge as one of the inaugural Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Rutledge left the Supreme Court in 1791 to become Chief Justice of the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas and Sessions. He returned to the Supreme Court, this time as Chief Justice, following the resignation of [[John Jay]] in June 1795. As the vacancy came during a long [[United States Senate|Senate]] recess, Washington named Rutledge as the new chief justice by a [[recess appointment]].  When the Senate reconvened in December 1795, it rejected Rutledge's nomination by a 10–14 vote. Rutledge resigned his commission shortly thereafter, and withdrew from public life until his death in 1800. He holds the record for the shortest tenure of any Chief Justice. His was the first Supreme Court nomination to be rejected by the Senate, and he remains the only "recess appointed" justice not to be subsequently confirmed by the Senate.

== Early life and family ==
[[File:Coat of Arms of John Rutledge.svg|175px|thumb|left|Coat of Arms of John Rutledge]]
Rutledge was the eldest child in a large family in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].  His father was Scotch-Irish immigrant John Rutledge (Sr.) (1713–1750), the physician. His mother, South Carolina–born Sarah (''née'' Hext; born September 18, 1724), was of English descent. John had six younger siblings: Andrew (1740–1772), Thomas (1741–1783), Sarah (1742–1819), Hugh (1745–1811), Mary (1747–1832), and Edward (1749–1800). John's early education was provided by his father until the latter's death. The rest of Rutledge's primary education was provided by an [[Anglican]] priest.&lt;ref name="Flanders"&gt;{{cite book

John took an early interest in law and often "played lawyer" with his brothers and sisters. When he was 17 years old, Rutledge began to read law under a man named James Parsons. Two years later, Rutledge sailed to England to further his studies at London's [[Middle Temple]]. In the course of his studies, he won several cases in English courts.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 438–439&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing his studies, Rutledge returned to Charleston to begin a fruitful legal career. At the time, many new lawyers barely scraped together enough business to earn their livings. Most new lawyers could only hope that they would win well-known cases to ensure their success.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 447–448&lt;/ref&gt; Rutledge, however, emerged almost immediately as one of the most prominent lawyers in Charleston, and his services were in high demand.&lt;ref name="Fradin"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his successful legal career, he was able to build on his mother's fortune. On May 1, 1763, Rutledge married Elizabeth Grimké (born 1742). Rutledge was very devoted to his wife, and Elizabeth's death on July 6, 1792, was a major cause of the illness that affected Rutledge in his later years.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 451&lt;/ref&gt;

John and Elizabeth had 10 children: Martha Henrietta (1764–1816), Sarah (born and died 1765), [[John Rutledge, Jr.|John]] (1766–1819), Edward James (1767–1811), Frederick Wilkes (1769–1821), William Spencer (1771–1821), Charles Wilson (1773–1821), Thomas (born 1774 and died young), Elizabeth (1776–1842), and States Whitcomb (1783–1829).

== Pre-Revolutionary War ==
In mid-1765 Rutledge was an important figure in the [[Stamp Act Congress]]. This congress produced a resolution that stated that it was "the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on them but with their own consent, given personally, or by their representatives." Rutledge chaired a committee that drew up a petition to the [[House of Lords]] attempting to persuade them to reject the Stamp Act. They were ultimately unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 460&lt;/ref&gt;

When the delegates returned to South Carolina after the Congress adjourned, they found the state in turmoil. The people had destroyed all the [[revenue stamp]]s they could find; they broke into the houses of suspected [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]]  to search for stamps. When the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] went into effect on November 1, 1765, there were no stamps in the entire colony. Dougal Campbell, the Charleston [[court clerk]], refused to issue any papers without the stamps. Because of this, all legal processes in the entire state came to a standstill until news that the Stamp Act had been repealed reached South Carolina in early May 1766.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 463–464&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Stamp Act conflict ended, Rutledge went back into private life, and to his law practice. Besides serving in the colonial legislature, he did not involve himself in politics. His law practice continued to expand and he became fairly wealthy as a result.&lt;ref name="Hartley"&gt;{{cite book
|last=Hartley |first=Cecil B. |title=Heroes and Patriots of the South |year=1860 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TgoGi4jDHOcC |accessdate=2008-04-30 |edition= |series= |publisher=G. G. Evans |location=Philadelphia |isbn= |oclc= |id= |page=294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, Rutledge was elected to the [[First Continental Congress]]. It is not known for certain exactly what John Rutledge did in the Congress. The records of the Congress refer only to "Rutledge", though both John and his brother [[Edward Rutledge]] were present. The most important contribution made by "Rutledge" to the Congress was during the debate on how to apportion votes in the Congress. Some wanted votes to be apportioned by the population of the colonies. Others wanted to give each colony one vote. "Rutledge" observed that as the Congress had no legal authority to ''force'' the colonies to accept its decisions, it would make the most sense to give each colony one vote. The other delegates ultimately agreed to this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 481–482&lt;/ref&gt;

== President of South Carolina ==
John Rutledge served in the First Continental Congress and the [[Second Continental Congress]] until 1776. That year, he was elected President of South Carolina under a constitution drawn up on March 26, 1776. Upon taking office, he worked quickly to organize the new government and to prepare defenses against British attack.&lt;ref name="Hartley296"&gt;Hartley 296–297&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1776, Rutledge learned that British forces would attempt to take Charleston. In response, he ordered the construction of Fort Sullivan (now [[Fort Moultrie National Monument|Fort Moultrie]]) on [[Sullivan's Island]] in [[Charleston Harbor]]. When the British arrived, the fort was only half completed. [[Charles Lee (general)|General Charles Lee]] of the [[Continental Army]], who had arrived a few days earlier with reinforcements from [[North Carolina]], told Rutledge the fort should be evacuated, as Lee considered it indefensible. Lee said that the fort would fall in under a half an hour, and all the men would be killed.&lt;ref name="Hartley296"/&gt; In a note to the fort's commanding officer, Colonel [[William Moultrie]], Rutledge wrote "General Lee ... wishes you to evacuate the fort. You will not, without [an] order from me. I would sooner cut off my hand than write one."&lt;ref&gt;Fradin 91&lt;/ref&gt; Rutledge, noticed that Lee was arrogant and uncouth and unfit to control the militia.  Rutledge, by virtue of being elected by the state gained control of the militia.  Rutledge let it be known that only he could order the militia to defend Charleston. During this time, Rutledge garnered the nickname "Dictator John" by virtue of getting his way with things.&lt;ref&gt;Horton 142&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 1776, the British attacked the fort, expecting it to fall quickly. However, the fort's walls were made out of palmetto logs packed with sand, and the British cannonballs were absorbed into the soft core of the logs without doing much damage, and the British were repulsed, saving Charleston. The battle anniversary is still celebrated as "Carolina Day", on June 28 each year. South Carolina's current "[[Palmetto flag|Palmetto Flag]]", adopted in 1861, features the crescent symbol on the defending soldiers' caps along with the Palmetto tree.&lt;ref&gt;Fradin 91–92&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutledge continued as President of South Carolina until 1778. That year, the South Carolina legislature proposed a new constitution. Rutledge vetoed it, stating that it moved the state dangerously close to a [[direct democracy]], which Rutledge believed was only a step away from total anarchy. When the legislature overrode his veto, Rutledge resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 551&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governor of South Carolina ==
A few months after Rutledge's resignation, the British, having suffered several defeats in the North, decided to try to retake the South. Lieutenant-Colonel [[Archibald Campbell (Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]] landed in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with 3,000 men and quickly took control of the entire state.&lt;ref name="f561"&gt;Flanders 561&lt;/ref&gt;

The new state constitution was revised, and in 1779, Rutledge was elected governor. While the first governor independent from Great Britain, Rutledge is considered by historians and the Government of South Carolina to be the 31st Governor, counting from the Colonial Governors. ''See: [[List of Governors of South Carolina]].'' Rutledge sent troops under General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] into Georgia to harass the British. The new British commander in the south, General Jacques Prevost, responded by marching on Charleston with 2,500 troops. When Rutledge heard about this threat, he hurried to Charleston and worked furiously to build up defenses. In spite of Rutledge's efforts, when General Prevost arrived outside Charleston, the British force had been greatly increased by the addition of Loyalists, and the Americans were vastly outnumbered.&lt;ref name="f561"/&gt;

Rutledge privately asked Prevost for surrender terms. Prevost made an offer, but when Rutledge submitted it to the council of war, the council instructed Rutledge to ask if the British would accept a declaration of South Carolina's [[Neutral country|neutrality]] in the Revolution. They forbade Rutledge from surrendering mainly because William Moultrie, who was now a general, believed that the Americans had at least as many troops as the British force, which consisted largely of untrained civilians.

Prevost replied that as he was faced with such a large military force, he would have to take some of them prisoner before he could accept. Moultrie advised the council that he would never stand by and allow the British to take Americans prisoner without fighting, so the council decided to fight it out. The city braced itself for an attack, but the next morning, the British had disappeared. Prevost had intercepted a letter from General Lincoln to Moultrie saying that he was marching to the aid of Charleston, and Prevost decided that he could not hold out if the Americans got reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 561–564&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charleston occupied ===
[[File:Charlestownmap.jpeg|thumb|left|260px|A map showing the battle lines during the British siege in 1780.]]
In early 1780, Sir [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] attacked South Carolina, and Charleston was thrown into a panic. The legislature adjourned upon learning of the British. Their last action was to give Rutledge power to do anything short of execution without trial. Rutledge did his best to raise militia forces, but Charleston was in the midst of a [[smallpox]] epidemic, and few dared to enter the city.

In February, Clinton landed near Charleston with 5,000 troops. By May he had 9,000 troops to less than 2,500 Americans in the area. The [[siege of Charleston]] ensued. On May 10, Charleston surrendered.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 568–569&lt;/ref&gt; Rutledge had left the city. He remained Governor of the unconquered part of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 573&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the Americans defeated the British at the [[Battle of Cowpens]] in January 1781, they could not drive the British back to Charleston until June 1781, when General [[Nathanael Greene]] arrived with more troops.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 576–577&lt;/ref&gt; The British held Charleston until December 14, 1782.  John Rutledge's term of office had already ended, and he did not run again, because of term limits.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 588–589&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}} A few weeks after leaving the governorship, Rutledge was again elected to the [[Continental Congress]], where he served until 1783. In 1784, he was appointed to the South Carolina [[Court of equity|Court of Chancery]], where he served until 1791.

== Slavery ==

Like many prominent [[European-American]] men in South Carolina at the time, he owned [[African American]] people as [[slaves]].

According to the state library of South Carolina:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although Rutledge claimed that he disliked slavery, as an attorney he twice defended individuals who abused slaves. Before the American Revolution, Rutledge owned sixty slaves; afterward, he possessed twenty-eight. His wife Elizabeth [[Manumission|manumitted]] her own slaves, and his nieces were abolitionists [[Grimké sisters|Sarah and Angelina Grimké]]. Despite this, Rutledge convinced the Constitutional Convention not to abolish slavery. When Rutledge died in 1800, he only owned one slave due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.sc.edu/digital/slaveryscc/intellectual-founders.html|title=Intellectual Founders – Slavery at South Carolina College, 1801–1865|publisher= University of South Carolina Libraries|accessdate=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Encounter with a tavern keeper ==
In 1784, the South Carolina legislature threatened to exile a tavern keeper by the name of William Thompson, for insulting "Dictator" John Rutledge, now the former governor and a prominent figure in the state. Rutledge had sent a female servant to Thompson's tavern to watch a fireworks display from the roof.  Thompson denied  the servant admittance and sent her back to Rutledge. Rutledge was furious and demanded that Thompson come to his house and apologize. Thompson refused and, believing that his honor had been affronted by Rutledge's arrogant request, challenged Rutledge to a duel. Since people like Rutledge did not associate with tavern keepers, Rutledge went to the South Carolina House of Representatives and insisted that it pass a bill banishing Thompson from the state for insulting a government official.&lt;ref&gt;Wood&lt;/ref&gt;  Thompson claimed that, Rutledge and others who were wealthy composed "the grand hierarchy of the State." Thompson argued that independent people required leaders who were "good, able, useful and friends to social equality." This altercation changed the hierarchy of state legislatures for years to come.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper 100–101,&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constitutional Convention ==
{{further|Philadelphia Convention|l1=Constitutional Convention}}
[[File:John Rutledge color painting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rutledge around the time of the Convention.]]
In 1787, Rutledge was selected to represent South Carolina in the [[Philadelphia Convention]] which was called to revise the [[Articles of Confederation]], but instead produced the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Flanders 602"&gt;Flanders 602&lt;/ref&gt; He attended all the sessions and served on five committees.&lt;ref name="Madison"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Convention, Rutledge maintained a moderate nationalist stance and chaired the [[Committee of Detail]]. After the Convention had debated the [[Virginia Plan]] and settled some major points of controversy, the Committee of Detail, which Rutledge chaired, assembled during the convention's July 4 recess.&lt;ref name="Stewart p168"&gt;Stewart, David. ''The Summer of 1787''. p168&lt;/ref&gt; Though the committee did not record its minutes, it is known that the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other sources, to produce the first full draft. Much of what was included in this draft consisted of details, such as powers given to Congress, that hadn't been debated by the Convention. Most of these were uncontroversial and unchallenged, and as such much of what Rutledge's committee included in this first draft made it into the final version of the Constitution without debate.&lt;ref name="Stewart p168"/&gt;

Rutledge recommended that the executive power should consist of a single person, rather than several, because he felt that one person would feel the responsibility of the office more acutely. Because the president would not be able to defer a decision to another "co-president", Rutledge concluded that a single person would be more likely to make a good choice.&lt;ref name="Flanders 602"/&gt; Rutledge was largely responsible for denying the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] the right to give [[advisory opinions]]. Being a judge himself, he strongly believed that a judge's sole purpose was to resolve legal conflicts; he held that a judge should hand down an opinion only when ruling on an actual case. He also thought that the legal community was the higher tier of society.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 604&lt;/ref&gt;

Rutledge also argued that if either house of the legislature was to have the sole authority to introduce [[appropriation bill]]s, it should be the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. He noted that the Senate, by nature of its lengthier terms of office, would tend to be more leisurely in its actions. Because of this, Rutledge felt that the Senate would be better able to think clearly about what the consequences of a bill would be. Also, since the bills could not become law without the consent of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], he concluded that there would be no danger of the Senate ruling the country.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 606&lt;/ref&gt;

When the proposal was made that only landowners should have the right to vote, Rutledge opposed it perhaps more strongly than any other motion in the entire convention. He stated that making such a rule would divide the people into "haves" and "have nots", would create an undying resentment against landowners, and could do nothing but cause discord. He was supported by [[Benjamin Franklin]], and the rule was not adopted.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 607&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debate on slavery in the new country, Rutledge took the side of the slave-owners; he was a Southerner and he owned several slaves. Rutledge said that if the Constitution forbade slavery, the Southern states would never agree to the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 609–610&lt;/ref&gt;

== Supreme Court Associate Justice ==
On September 24, 1789, George Washington nominated Rutledge for one of the five associate justice positions on the newly established Supreme Court. His appointment (along with those of: [[John Blair Jr.]], [[William Cushing]], [[Robert H. Harrison]], and [[James Wilson]]; plus that of John Jay for Chief Justice) was confirmed by the Senate two days later.&lt;ref name=SCNomsSenate&gt;{{Cite web| title=Supreme Court Nominations: present-1789| url=https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/nominations/Nominations.htm| publisher=United States Senate| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His service on the Court officially began February 15, 1790, when he took the Judicial Oath, and continued until March 5, 1791.&lt;ref name=SCjustices/&gt; Rutledge resigned from the Supreme Court, without having ever heard a case, in order to become Chief Justice of the South Carolina Court of Common Pleas and Sessions.&lt;ref&gt;Flanders 622&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senate2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/A_Chief_Justice_Rejected.htm |title=1787–1800 – December 15, 1795 Chief Justice Nomination Rejected |publisher=United States Senate Historical Office |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chief Justice of the United States ==
[[File:John Rutledge senate.jpg|right|thumb|A bust of John Rutledge located in the United States Supreme Court.]]
On June 28, 1795, Chief Justice John Jay resigned, having been elected [[Governor of New York]]. Washington selected Rutledge to succeed Jay as Chief Justice, and, as the Senate would not be meeting again until December, gave Rutledge a recess appointment so that he could serve as Chief Justice during the upcoming August Session. He was commissioned as the second Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on June 30, 1795,&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Louis |url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RL31112.pdf |title=Recess Appointments of Federal Judges |format=[[PDF]]|publisher=Congressional Research Service |date=2001-09-05 |pages=14–15|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took the Judicial Oath on August 12.&lt;ref name=SCjustices/&gt;

On July 16, 1795, Rutledge gave a highly controversial speech denouncing the [[Jay Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]].  He reportedly said in the speech "that he had rather the President should die than sign that puerile instrument"– and that he "preferred war to an adoption of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Independent Chronicle'' (Boston).  August 13, 1795, reprinted in Marcus, Maeva, and Perry, James Russell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=2PEjLba7EYAC&amp;pg=PA780 ''The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789–1800''] p. 780&lt;/ref&gt;  Rutledge's speech against the Jay Treaty cost him the support of many in the Washington Administration, which supported the treaty, and in the Senate, which would soon be called upon to advise the President on his nomination of Rutledge to the judicial post and to consent to its ratification by a two-thirds vote.

Two cases were decided while Rutledge was chief justice. In ''[[United States v. Peters (1795)|United States v. Peters]],'' the Court ruled that federal district courts had no jurisdiction over crimes committed against Americans in [[international waters]]. In ''[[Talbot v. Janson]]'', the Court held that a citizen of the United States did not waive all claims to U.S. citizenship by either renouncing citizenship of an individual state, or by becoming a citizen of another country. The [[Rutledge Court]] thus established an important precedent for [[multiple citizenship]] in the United States.

By the time of his formal nomination to the Court on December 10, 1795, Rutledge's reputation was in tatters and support for his nomination had faded.  Rumors of mental illness and [[alcohol abuse]] swirled around him, concocted largely by the [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] press.  His words and actions in response to the Jay Treaty were used as evidence of his continued mental decline.&lt;ref name="senate2"/&gt; The Senate rejected his appointment on December 15, 1795 by a vote of 14–10. This was the first time that the Senate had rejected a Supreme Court nomination. To date, it is the only Supreme Court recess appointment not to be subsequently confirmed,&lt;ref name="senate2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Wermiel| first=Stephen| date=February 15, 2013| title=SCOTUS for law students (sponsored by Bloomberg Law): Recess appointments and the Court| url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/02/scotus-for-law-students-sponsored-by-bloomberg-law-recess-appointments-and-the-court/| publisher=SCOTUSblog, Supreme Court of the United States| accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rutledge remains the only Supreme Court justice unseated involuntarily by the Senate.

The Senate's rejection of his nomination left Rutledge mentally ruined. On December 26, 1795, he attempted suicide by jumping off a wharf into Charleston Harbor.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haw, James.

Regarding the Senate's rejection of Rutledge's nomination, then Vice President [[John Adams]] wrote to his wife [[Abigail Adams|Abigail]] that it "gave me pain for an old friend, though I could not but think he deserved it. Chief Justices must not go to illegal Meetings and become popular orators in favor of Sedition, nor inflame the popular discontents which are ill founded, nor propagate Disunion, Division, Contention and delusion among the people."&lt;ref&gt;Maltese, John.

==Biography==

===Modeling===

====Early career====
Mascó grew up in a [[middle class]] family, daughter of a headmaster. At age 15, she started her career in the fashion world, while taking piano lessons and attending school. Her breakthrough was at age 13 in a television commercial. She began her studies as a model at the [[Francina International Modeling Agency]]'s School. She was later signed to the agency and began modeling for print. Her modeling pursuits led her to Japan and Italy mainly.

====International career====
Mascó appeared in the 1990 ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'' as the cover model. She also appeared in the 1991, 1992, 1994, and 1995 editions. This cover launched her worldwide and was quickly hired for various high-profile advertising campaigns, including [[Max Mara]], [[Laurèl]] by [[Escada]], [[Armand Bassi]], [[Betty Barclay]], [[Georges Rech]], [[Mango (clothing)|Mango]], Majestic and [[Palmers Lingerie]]. She kept been the face of a variety of advertising campaigns including [[Natura Bissé]], [[El Corte Inglés]], [[Clairol]], [[Coty Beauty Lancaster Group|Lancaster]], [[Trident]], [[Fila (company)|Fila]], [[Clarins]] or [[Timotei]]. Mascó is also the only Spanish model (and with [[Penélope Cruz]] the only Spaniard woman) who has graced on the cover of US ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''. She has been featured in fashion spreads in most major fashion magazines including covers like French, Canadian, American, Spanish, Swedish and Italian ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo]]'', ''[[Woman (magazine)|Woman]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', ''[[Marie Claire]]'', ''[[Sposabella]]'', ''[[Telva]]'', ''Ocean Drive'', ''[[New Woman]]'' or ''[[Amica (Italy)|Amica]]''.

Mascó has worked with the most well-known photographers in the fashion industry in the 1990s, such as [[Hans Feurer]], [[Gilles Bensimon]], [[Ellen Von Unwerth]], [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]], [[Oliviero Toscani]], [[Steven Meisel]], [[Fabrizio Ferri]], [[Albert Watson (photographer)|Albert Watson]] or [[Patrick Demarchelier]] among others.

====Modeling after 30====
[[File:Judit Mascó (3505461028).jpg|thumb|Mascó in 2009 signing her last book's copies]]
Mascó is regarded as one of the best Spanish models of the 1990s and still appears in print occasionally. She became the exclusive spokesmodel for the cosmetics brand [[Natura Bissé]] from 2004 until 2008. At the time she worked for [[Swarovski]] among others. In 2009 she signed for [[Olay]].

===Acting career===
She played  supporting roles in ''Después del sueño'' (After the Dream) and ''El largo invierno'' (The Long Winter of '39), two Spanish films from the early 90's and was asked to become a [[Bond girl]] and to star in ''[[A Walk in the Clouds]]'' (1995), although due to her busy schedule in fashion she turned down those offers.

===Television career===
Mascó's television career began collaborating in the fashion section of TV shows. She made several appearances in Spanish TV series as herself.
In 2006 and 2007, she hosted the [[reality television]] show ''[[Supermodelo]]'' in [[Cuatro TV]].
She left the show the one season before it was canceled in 2008. That year she hosted the show "Els 25" (The 25) in [[TV3 (Catalonia)]].
Currently, Masco can be seen on television as the hostess of [[La 2 (Spain)|La 2]]'s TV show [[Actívate]].

===Awards===
Mascó received the prestigious [[Elle (magazine)|Elle]] [[Woman of the Year]] Award in 2003 and the [[Protagonistas]] Award in 2009 for her [[activism]].

===Activism===
Outside of TV, modeling, and writing, Mascó is involved in social change efforts. She is a board member of several [[international nongovernmental organizations]] such as the [[Vicente Ferrer Moncho|Vicente Ferrer]] Foundation,the [[Asociación de Donantes de Riñón Españoles]] (Association of Spanish Kidney Donors), [[Amics de la Gent Gran]](Friends of the Elderly) and the [[Caravana Solidaria al África Occidental]] ([[West Africa Solidarity Caravan]]). In addition she is the president of the Festival of Childhood and Youth, held in Barcelona and advisory board member of [[Oxfam]] Spain.
In 2000 she traveled to Florida to meet with Spanish citizen [[Joaquin José Martínez]], at the time imprisoned in the [[death row]], to alert the media of an unfair  [[death sentence]] for two murders he did not commit. Her visit was due to a campaign of pressure from Spain. All the media coverage helped the conviction mistrial by the  Florida Supreme Court that accepted to achieve the retrial of Martínez in which he was acquitted of all charges.

===Writing===
Mascó has written two books. In 2003, her self-described memoir, ''El Libro de Judit Mascó'' (''Judit Mascó's book''), was published. In 2009, she released her second book, ''Modelo'' (''Model'') in which she describes her job as a model and intends to guide young girls into this world.

===Personal life===
She is married to lawyer Eduardo Vicente, who was a high school classmate of her brother. They have four daughters, one of them an adopted girl from [[Haiti]].

'''Saint Junian''' ({{lang-fr|Saint Junien}}) was a 6th-century [[Christian]] [[hermit]] and [[abbot]].  He was the founder of Mairé, or Mariacum, Abbey at [[Mairé-Levescault]] in [[Poitou]], [[France]] and is the [[patron saint]] of [[Poitou]] ploughmen.

He was born at the beginning of the 6th century, in 500 or 501, in a in the area of "Briosso" (now called [[Briançais]] or [[Brioux]]) near or on an estate named "Champagné" which still exists ([[Champagné-le-Sec]]),&lt;ref name="junien"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diocese-poitiers.com.fr/patrimoine/saints.html|title=Quelques saints du Poitou et d'ailleurs|date=|publisher= |accessdate=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and close to the village of [[Mairé]] in the commune of [[Perigné]], Deux-Sèvres.

He was educated by his parents who were [[Gallo-Roman]] nobility. Although his name is undoubtedly of [[Paganism|Pagan]] origin, coming from the [[Roman god]]s [[Hera|Juno]]/[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], he was dedicated to the service of God from his earliest childhood and was instructed in all the [[sacred]] and [[human sciences]] which were taught at that time.

Nothing else is known about his early life but we re-encounter Junien as a young man living a life of austerity as a hermit in a place called Bois Trappeau in the commune of [[Ardilleux]] in Deux-Sèvres.

Junian acquired disciples and in 559, King [[Clotaire I]] made him a gift of land on which to found a [[monastery]] dedicated to the rule of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benoît]] - the religious community at [[Mairé-l'Evescault]], south of [[Deux-Sèvres]]. This isolated place evoked memories of his childhood home and Junien named it "Mariacus" - subsequently "Mairé". The "L'Evescault" was added after a great religious festival in [[Poitiers]] to which Junien was invited by Queen [[Radagonde]] who raised him to the same rank as the other [[bishop]]s or "Les Evêques" who were present. Hence the name Mairé-L'Evescault.

He remained a friend of Queen Radegund who herself founded the abbey of [[Sainte-Croix de Poitiers]].&lt;ref name="junien"/&gt;  Junian and Radegonde died on the same day, on August 13, 587.&lt;ref name="junien"/&gt; 
  
Junian's [[monastery]] at Mairé was partially destroyed during the wars of [[Pippin III|Pepin the Short]] and [[Charlemagne]] but survived for another thousand years. It was finally demolished during the [[French Revolution]], the stone being re-used for local construction and the lands reverting to their farming origins.

'''Malek Shafi’i''' ({{nq|ملک شفیعی}}) is a film director, producer, festival organiser, and human rights activist from [[Afghanistan]].

== Biography ==
Malek Shafi’i is the Founder and Executive Director of Afghanistan International Human Rights Film Festival (AIHRFF). He is an award-winning film documentary maker based in [[Kabul]] and has been working in the war-torn country and abroad for the past 13 years. Shafi’i completed his education at Baagh Ferdaws Filmmaking Center in Tehran and Sociology studies in Kateb University in Kabul. Additionally, he attended film production, arts management courses and studies in the Netherlands and the United States. Malek returned to Afghanistan after 20 years of exile and founded "Bashgahe Cinema - Afghanistan Cinema Club – [[BASA Film]] " in 2006, a non-profit organization that promotes cultural and arts development projects with a focus on training and producing the work of emerging afghan filmmakers in Afghanistan. Other cultural projects where he has collaborated extensively include: Kabul International Documentary and Short Film Festival; and Second Take Film Festival 2008 – a film festival that juxtaposes the theme of "gender, cinema and society" in Afghanistan.

Malek has also acted as a Senior Media and Communication Advisor for RTA (Radio Television of Afghanistan), different NGO’s and international organizations as well as with the United Nations system of agencies in Afghanistan, implementing film and media projects on the promotion of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He has directed and produced more than 30 films. Some of them won international film awards from different international film festivals in previous years. Shafi’i was a Jury member of the Tolo TV Film Festival, Kabul Film Festival, Amnesty Award of CPH-DOX, ADB (Asian Development Bank) My View Video competition and in the category judge of BANFF. Malek is a 2012 ArtsLink Residencies program Fellow in Visual Arts and Media, a program that engages communities through international arts partnerships. 
In order to use the power of traditional and new media to influence filmmaking and impact human rights and to connect Afghanistan’s current situation to other human rights issues from other parts of the world and with the need to create a cinematography stage to help Afghan filmmakers showcase their talent and expertise to Afghan filmgoers and the international audience living in Afghanistan, Malek joined creative forces with Afghan documentary filmmaker and human rights activist [[Diana Saqeb]] and Multimedia Producer and Arts Director Hassan Zakizadeh in 2011 to launch the first edition of Afghanistan Human Rights Film Festival in Kabul, as well as other provinces of the country with the main objective of bringing human rights stories to a broader audience and to the real Afghan context.

*Afghanistan Human Rights Film Festival [http://www.ahrfestival.org/]
AHRF is an international film festival focusing on the subject of human rights. It aims to encourage film makers who use their cameras to document struggles against discrimination, injustice and violence.

We have been working towards this festival since 2009 and we are delighted that the first Human Rights Film Festival held in Kabul on 1–7 October 2011.

The festival is being organised by the Afghanistan Cinema Club with the support of various national and international organizations. It aims to be a hub for film makers and artists working despite of censorship in their countries and whose works are restricted from public screenings.

The AHRF is a platform to share the works of film makers and artists who have unfortunately been marginalized by the authority.  It will present stories of lives affected by war, discrimination and injustice. These stories are of people who have resisted oppression and fought against violence to create a more humane world.

AHRF invites entries to the festival. The entries can be documentary, feature film, short film, animation or video art on the subject of human rights. Entry is open to all national and international entrants. There are two categories for entry: national and international.

However, the offer was revoked before the prince could make a reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vpS7DEKrsUC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=Gorham+president+continental+congress&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigo5mAiMXaAhVqUN8KHYmSDWkQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Gorham%20president%20continental%20congress&amp;f=false|title=The Founders: The 39 Stories Behind the U.S. Constitution|last=Fradin|first=Dennis Brindell|date=2005|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|year=|isbn=9780802789723|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several months in 1787, Gorham served as one of the Massachusetts delegates to the [[United States Constitutional Convention]].&lt;ref name=Morton118&gt;Morton, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Gorham frequently served as Chairman of the Convention's [[Committee of the Whole]], meaning that he (rather than the President of the Convention, [[George Washington]]) presided over convention sessions during the delegates' first deliberations on the structure of the new government in late May and June 1787. After the convention, he worked hard to see that the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] was approved in his home state.
In connection with [[Oliver Phelps]], he purchased from the state of Massachusetts in 1788 pre-emption rights to an immense tract of land in western New York State which straddled the [[Genesee River]], all for the sum of $1,000,000 (about ${{Formatprice|{{inflation|US|1000000|1800|r=2}}}} today) (the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]]).&lt;ref name=Morton120&gt;Morton, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKeveley |first= Blake|date=January 1939 |title=Historic Aspects of the Phelps and Gorham Treaty of July 4–8, 1788 |journal=Rochester History |volume=1 |issue=1 | publisher=Rochester Public Library | issn =0035-7413 |url=http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/~rochhist/v1_1939/v1i1.pdf |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land in question had been previously ceded to Massachusetts from the state of New York under the 1786 [[Treaty of Hartford (1786)|Treaty of Hartford]]. The pre-emption right gave them the first or preemptive right to obtain clear title to this land from the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. They soon extinguished the Indian title to the portion of the land ''east'' of the Genesee River, as well as a {{convert|185,000|acre|km2}} tract ''west'' of the Genesee, the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase#Mill Yard Tract|Mill Yard Tract]], surveyed all of it, laid out townships, and sold large parts to speculators and settlers. Nathaniel Gorham Jr. (died October 22, 1836, [[Canandaigua, New York]]) was a pioneer settler of this tract, having been placed in charge of his father's interests there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Appletons' |inline=1 |wstitle=Gorham, Nathaniel |year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, after Gorham and Phelps defaulted in payment, they sold nearly all of their unsold lands ''east'' of the Genesee to [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]], who eventually resold those lands to [[The Pulteney Association]]. Phelps and Gorham were unable to fulfill their contract in full to Massachusetts, so in 1790, they surrendered back to Massachusetts that portion of the lands which remained under the Indian title, namely, the land ''west'' of the Genesee. It also was eventually acquired by Robert Morris, who resold most of it to The [[Holland Land Company]]. Morris did keep {{convert|500,000|acre|km2}} of land that became known as [[The Morris Reserve]].

===Death and legacy===
Gorham died in [[Charlestown, Massachusetts]], in 1796. A eulogy was delivered in his memory by Dr. Thomas Welch of Charlestown.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Welch was a 1772 graduate of Harvard College. He served as a surgeon in the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in the [[Phipps Street Burying Ground|Phipps Street Cemetery]] in Charlestown.&lt;ref name=Morton120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/gorham.htm US Army Center of Military History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorham Street in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/odd/archives/002071.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The Town of [[Gorham, New York]], is also named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA140|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3458">'''Publius Metilius Nepos''' (c. 45&amp;ndash;127) was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Roman senate|senator]] during the late 1st century. He is known to have been [[Roman consul|suffect consul]] in the ''[[nundinium]]'' of September-December 91,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gallivan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/638472 "The Fasti for A. D. 70-96"], ''[[Classical Quarterly]]'', 31 (1981), pp. 191, 218&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed [[Roman governor|Governor]] of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] by the Emperor [[Domitian]] before his death, and held the post until 98.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Birley, ''The Fasti of Roman Britain'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

While governor, he may have founded the [[Colonia (Roman)|colonies]] of ''Colonia Domitiana Lindensium'' ([[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]) and ''Colonia Nervia Glevensium'' ([[Gloucester]]).

Further details about Nepos are more difficult to be confident about. The inscriptions of the [[Frater Arvale]] record a '''Publius Metilius Sabinus Nepos''' as one of their brotherhood who attended their meetings in the years 105, 110, and 111, who had died by 26 February 118 when a successor was co-opted in his place.&lt;ref name=Birley-84&gt;Birley, ''Fasti'', p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a papyrus from [[Roman Egypt]] records the joint consulate of P. Metilius Nepos II and [[Marcus Annius Libo]] for 128; apparently Nepos died in late 127, and his term assigned to another person. Some assistance is provided by the presence of a "Metilius" -- who could be Publius Metilius Nepos or Publius Metilius Sabinus Nepos -- as suffect consul in 103. It is likely we have two consular senators with similar names: one died before February 118, the other in late 127.&lt;ref name=Birley-84/&gt;

[[Pliny the Younger]] addressed several letters to a Nepos, and at least one more to a Sabinus. It is not yet possible to determine which Nepos Pliny was writing to, nor even assure he was writing to either of these Metilii Nepotes.

The question of children and descendants is an open one. On one hand there is a [[Publius Metilius Secundus|Publius Metilius P.f. Secundus]], suffect consul in 123, who could be the son of either Metilii Nepotes; on the other, Anthony Birley notes there are two [[polyonymy|polyonymous]] senators of the next generation whose names are part of their nomenclature: [[Marcus Sedatus Severianus]] consul in 153, and [[Marcus Metilius Aquillius Regulus]] consul in 157.&lt;ref&gt;Birley, ''Fasti'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The solution awaits further information.

'''Refugee crisis''' can refer to movements of large groups of [[displaced people]], who could be either [[internally displaced person]]s, [[Forced displacement|forced displaced people]], [[refugee]]s or other migrants. It can also refer to incidents in the country of origin or departure, to large problems whilst on the move or even after arrival in a safe country that involve large groups of displaced persons, [[asylum seeker]]s or refugees. According to the [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]], in 2017, 65.6 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide because of [[persecution]], [[Conflict (process)|conflict]], [[violence]], or [[human rights]] violations alone.

==Definition==
Refugee crisis can refer to large groups of displaced people, who could be either internally displaced persons, refugees or other migrants, the incidents in their country of origin, or to problems while on the move, or it can refer to problems in the hosting countries after arrival involving large groups of displaced persons, asylum seekers or refugees.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Causes==
Causes for refugee crises can include war and civil war,
human rights violations,
environment and climate.
===War and civil war===
In June 2015 the UN refugee agency reported that [[war]]s and [[persecution]]s are the main reasons behind the refugee crises all over the world. A decade earlier, six people were forced to leave their homes every 60 seconds, but this average has increased four times because of the wars that drive 24 people from their homes each minute in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2016/6/5763b65a4/global-forced-displacement-hits-record-high.html|title=Global forced displacement hits record high|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|access-date=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights violations===
In countries ravaged by massive corruption and greed by those in political positions, many people have been forced to leave their homes in search of survival in foreign lands. The corruption and greed by those in power in such countries includes their amassal of too much wealth at the expense of many, and they end up grabbing property such as land from the marginalized and murdering the innocent, situations where even when one has the necessary qualifications, he or she cannot find work, all work positions are occupied by relatives who sometimes may not even be qualified for them, all the countries' resources are in the hands of the lucky few in political positions coupled by their misuse of surplus when many are suffering with nothing and remain in tears as is the case in many African nations for example [[Uganda]], [[Nigeria]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[South Sudan]], [[Sudan]], [[Eritrea]] and many others being on top of the most corrupt countries in the whole world when their citizens are suffering. This situation of marginalization Discrimination and inequality leads to many to get tired and risk their lives in boat voyages to anywhere they can expect some changes in their lives for example Europe, Canada or North America and Australia among other Countries as its shown in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wonderslist.com/world-10-most-corrupt-countries/|title=Top 10 Most Corrupt Countries in the World 2016|date=27 May 2016|website=Wonderslist.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment and climate===

Although they do not fit the definition of refugees set out in the UN Convention, people displaced by the effects of [[climate change]] have often been termed "climate refugees"&lt;ref name="Kirby"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/613075.stm|title=West warned on climate refugees |last=Kirby|first=Alex|date=24 January 2000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "climate change refugees".&lt;ref name="Strange"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/environment/article4159923.ece|title=UN warns of growth in climate change refugees|last=Strange|first=Hannah|date=17 June 2008|work=The Times|accessdate=17 July 2009 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'environmental refugee' is also commonly used and an estimated 25 million people can currently be classified as such.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate mass migration fears 'unfounded'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12360864|publisher=BBC News |date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alarming predictions by the UN, charities and some environmentalists, that between 200 million and 1 billion people could flood across international borders to escape the impacts of climate change in the next 40 years are realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security and the environment Climate wars Does a warming world really mean that more conflict is inevitable?|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16539538|work=Economist | date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Case studies from Bolivia, Senegal and Tanzania, three countries that are said to be prone to suffering the effects of climate change, show that people affected by environmental degradation rarely move across borders. Instead, they adapt to new circumstances by moving short distances for short periods, often to cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tacoli|first=Cecila|title=Not only climate change: mobility, vulnerability and socio-economic transformations in environmentally fragile areas in Bolivia, Senegal and Tanzania|year=2011|publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development|location=London|isbn=978-1-84369-808-1|pages=40|url=http://pubs.iied.org/10590IIED.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of people live in places that are vulnerable to the effects of climate change. They face extreme weather conditions such as droughts or floods. Their lives and livelihoods might be threatened in new ways and create new vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Bogumil Terminski, ''Environmentally-Induced Displacement. Theoretical Frameworks and Current Challenges'', Universite de Liège, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the effects of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, the term "refugee" was sometimes used to describe people displaced by the storm and the aftereffects. There was an outcry that the term should not be used to describe Americans displaced within their own county, and the term "evacuee" was substituted in its place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9232071/ |title=Associated Press story on debate |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UNHCR similarly opposes the use of the term 'refugee' in reference to environmental migrants, as this term has a strict legal definition.&lt;ref name="UNHCR on environmental migration terminology"&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0d00.pdf |title=Environmental refugees: myth or reality?, Richard Black |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic hardship===
{{Main|Economic migrant}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Boat People at Sicily in the Mediterranean Sea.jpg|thumb|North African immigrants in [[Sicily]].]]

A forcibly displaced person is distinguished from an economic migrant. In 2008, the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] suggested a better term for migrants who fled for the purpose of their and their dependents' basic survival was "forced humanitarian migrants". These economic migrants fall outside the mandates of the support structures offered by governments and non-governmental organisations for [[refugee]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Even economic migration requires a certain level of 'wealth' as migration is always a selective process - and the poorest and most vulnerable people are often excluded as they will find it almost impossible to move due to a lack of necessary funds or social support.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;

An example is the 2008-2009 mass movement of [[Zimbabwe]]ans to neighboring countries. Most migrants did not fit in either category and had more general needs that fell outside the specific mandate of the UNHCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polity.org.za/article/zimbabwean-migration-into-southern-africa-new-trends-and-responses-november-2009-2009-12-03|title=Zimbabwean migration into Southern Africa: new trends and responses (November 2009)|website=Polity.org.za|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To emphasize the importance of a common humanitarian position on the outflow of Zimbabweans into the region the [[Regional Office for Southern Africa]] of the [[UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] coined the term "migrants of humanitarian concern" in 2008. Most of those crossing the border did not apply for refugee status, but they could also hardly be considered as "voluntary" economic migrants. Many of them were not legally protected, nor do they receive humanitarian support. In Botswana, Zambia and Malawi, asylum is available to Zimbabweans; in Mozambique, the few applicants for asylum had been rejected due to the state's decision to consider Zimbabweans as 'economic' and not as forced humanitarian migrants.
Except for South Africa, protection and access to services in most countries in the region is contingent on receiving the refugee status, and require asylum seekers to stay in isolated camps, unable to work or travel, and thus send money to relatives that stayed behind in Zimbabwe. South Africa was considering the introduction of a special permit for Zimbabweans, but the policy was still under review.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Political Responses==
Since the establishment of the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]], instances of population displacement have been identified by registered non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in countries where local governments fail to provide or protect the economic means and social rights of their citizens.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In 1963, [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan]], then Deputy High Commissioner, stated - after visiting Africa - that some refugees are "a by product" and will probably "not have much of a chance to return to their country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/admin/hcspeeches/3ae68fb910/joint-press-conference-given-mr-felix-schnyder-united-nations-high-commissioner.html|title=Joint Press Conference given by Mr. Felix Schnyder, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, Deputy High Commissioner, 9 October 1963|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aga Khan Development Network]], led by the current Ismaili imam, the [[Aga Khan IV]], is engaged in "enhanced cooperation" with the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] to "help broaden the way the international community responds to crises today".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org/press-release/aga-khan-visits-unhcr-headquarters-discuss-enhanced-cooperation|title=Aga Khan visits UNHCR headquarters to discuss enhanced cooperation|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Refugees on a boat.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ecuador]]ian refugees near [[Guatemala]].]]
The term [[boat people]] came into common use in the 1970s with the mass exodus of Vietnamese refugees following the [[Vietnam War]]. It is a widely used form of migration for people migrating from [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Morocco]], [[Vietnam]] or [[Albania]]. They often risk their lives on dangerously crude and overcrowded boats to escape oppression or [[poverty]] in their home nations. Events resulting from the [[Vietnam War]] led many people in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and especially [[Vietnam]] to become refugees in the late 1970s and 1980s. In 2001, 353 asylum seekers sailing from [[Indonesia]] to Australia drowned when their [[SIEV X|vessel sank]].

The main danger to a boat person is that the boat he or she is sailing in may actually be anything that floats and is large enough for passengers. Although such makeshift craft can result in tragedy, in 2003 a small group of 5 [[Cubans|Cuban]] refugees attempted (unsuccessfully, but un-harmed) to reach [[Florida]] in a 1950s pickup truck made buoyant by oil barrels strapped to its sides.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Boat people are frequently a source of controversy in the nation they seek to immigrate to, such as the United States, New Zealand, Germany, France, Russia, Canada, Italy, Japan, [[South Korea]], Spain and Australia. Boat people are often forcibly prevented from landing at their destination, such as under Australia's [[Pacific Solution]] (which operated from 2001 until 2008), or they are subjected to [[mandatory detention]] after their arrival.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, J. and Hasmath, R. (2013) "[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2247142 Deterring the ‘Boat People’: Explaining the Australian Government's People Swap Response to Asylum Seekers]", ''Australian Journal of Political Science'' 48(4): 417-430.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three Mediterranean refugee routes: Eastern, Central and Western route.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Since 2015 more than 700.000 refugees and other migrants used these routes (i.e. the Eastern Balkan route and the Western Balkan route) from Greece through the [[Balkan]] to enter central European countries. Since March 2016 the Eastern route is almost closed, but the Western route is still{{when|date=August 2017}} busy.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Modern and contemporary refugee crises==
===Global population of concern===
{{See also|List of countries by refugee population}}
{{as of |2017}}, 65.6 million individuals have been forcibly displaced worldwide because of persecution, conflict, violence, or human rights violations, per the [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). Of these, 5.4 million were Palestinian refugees, which are not under UNHCR but under [[UNRWA]]’s mandate.

Since 2007, the refugee estimates include not only refugees per the narrow 1951 UN definition, but also people in refugee-like situations, so figures prior to 2007 are not fully comparable. The figure also includes [[internally displaced persons]] (IDP) within their country and people in IDP-like situations, which is descriptive and includes groups of persons who are inside their country of nationality or habitual residence and who face protection risks similar to those of IDPs but who, for practical or other reasons, could not be reported as such and stateless persons.&lt;ref name="UNHCR16"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unhcr.org/5943e8a34 | title=Global trends 2016, Annex Table 1| author= UN High Commissioner for Refugees(UNHCR)|publisher=United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees | date=19 June 2017 | pages=72| accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
[[File:Humanitarian Aid in Congo november 2008.jpeg|thumb|Distribution of humanitarian aid at a refugee camp in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].]]
Since the 1950s, many nations in Africa have suffered [[civil war]]s and ethnic strife, thus generating a massive number of refugees of many different [[Nationality|nationalities]] and [[ethnic group]]s. The number of refugees in Africa increased from 860,000 in 1968 to 6,775,000 by 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9063038|title=Refugee|publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year= 2004|website=www.britannica.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2004, that number had dropped to 2,748,400 refugees, according to the [[United Nations High Commission for Refugees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&amp;id=42b283744 UNHCR.ch] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613013433/http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&amp;id=42b283744 |date=13 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (That figure does not include [[internally displaced person]]s, who do not cross international borders and so do not fit the official definition of refugee.)

Many refugees in Africa cross into neighboring countries to find haven; often, African countries are simultaneously countries of origin for refugees and countries of asylum for other refugees. The [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], for instance, was the country of origin for 462,203 refugees at the end of 2004, but a country of asylum for 199,323 other refugees. The largest number of refugees in 2004 are from Sudan and have fled either the longstanding and recently concluded [[Second Sudanese Civil War|Sudanese Civil War]] or the [[War in Darfur]] and are located mainly in [[Chad]], [[Uganda]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Kenya]].

==== Algeria ====
{{main|Algerian refugee crisis}}
The [[International Organization for Migration]] has stated that refugee migration into Algeria has markedly increased since 2014, with most refugees arriving from Niger.&lt;ref name="ap-cbs"&gt;{{cite news |title=Walk or die: Algeria abandons more than 13,000 migrants in forced Sahara march |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/algeria-abandons-13000-migrants-forced-sahara-desert-march/ |accessdate=1 July 2018 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=CBS News |date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Associated Press]] over 14,000 refugees were expelled from Algeria between August 2017 and June 2018, with refugees forced to walk on foot through the [[Sahara]] to small towns in Niger. The AP reported that as many as 30,000 refugees had died in the desert in Algeria, Niger and nearby countries since 2014.&lt;ref name="ap-cbs" /&gt;

==== Angola ====
Decolonisation during the 1960s and 1970s often resulted in the mass exodus of [[White African|European-descended]] settlers out of Africa – especially from North Africa (1.6 million European ''[[pieds noirs]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEFDE1539F935A35757C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all For Pieds-Noirs, the Anger Endures], The New York Times, 6 April 1988&lt;/ref&gt; Congo, Mozambique and Angola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''The Economist '', 16 August 1975&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1970s, the Portugal's African territories were lost, and nearly one million Portuguese or persons of Portuguese descent left those territories (mostly Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]) as destitute refugees – the ''retornados''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/portugal/48.htm Portugal – Emigration], Eric Solsten, ed. Portugal: A Country Study. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), one of the largest and deadliest Cold War conflicts, erupted shortly after and spread out across the newly independent country. At least one million people were killed, four million were displaced internally and another half million fled as refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/4136de7f6.html Refugees Magazine Issue 131: (Africa) – Africa At A Glance], UNHCR&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Uganda ====
[[File:Ugandan children.jpg|thumb|right|[[Uganda]]n refugee children at a camp near Kitgum.]]
In the 1970s [[Uganda]] and other East African nations implemented racist policies that targeted the Asian population of the region. Uganda under [[Idi Amin]]'s leadership was particularly most virulent in its anti-Asian policies, eventually resulting in the [[Expulsion of Asians in Uganda in 1972|expulsion and ethnic cleansing of Uganda's Asian minority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-08-19/ahmedabad/27205829_1_idi-amin-kampala-ugandan|title=Ugandan refugees recount black deeds of 'butcher of Kampala' - Times of India|website=Artciles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly Indians born in the country.

The [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency]] forced many civilians to live in internally displaced person camps.

====Great Lakes====
{{Main|Great Lakes refugee crisis}}
In the aftermath of the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]], over two million people fled into neighboring countries, in particular [[Zaire]]. The refugee camps were soon controlled by the former government and [[Hutu]] militants who used the camps as bases to launch attacks against the new government in [[Rwanda]]. Little action was taken to resolve the situation and the crisis did not end until Rwanda-supported rebels forced the refugees back across the border at the beginning of the [[First Congo War]].

====Darfur====
An estimated 2.5 million people, roughly one-third the population of the [[Darfur]] area, have been forced to flee their homes after attacks by [[Janjaweed]] [[Arab]] militia backed by Sudanese troops during the ongoing war in Darfur in western [[Sudan]] since roughly 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/15/AR2006101500655.html|title=African Union Force Ineffective, Complain Refugees in Darfur|first=Alfred de|last=Montesquiou|date=16 October 2006|website=Washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article2768232.ece|title=Arabs pile into Darfur to take land 'cleansed' by janjaweed|website=News.independent.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716155314/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/africa/article2768232.ece|archivedate=16 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sudan====
{{see also|Refugees of Sudan|Sudanese refugees in Egypt|Sudanese refugees in Chad|Sudanese in Israel}}
There are tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees in Egypt, most of them seeking refuge from ongoing military conflicts in their home country of Sudan. Their official status as refugees is highly disputed, and they have been subject to racial discrimination and police violence. They live among a much larger population of Sudanese migrants in Egypt, more than two million people of Sudanese nationality (by most estimates; a full range is 750,000 to 4 million (FMRS 2006:5) who live in Egypt. The U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants believes many more of these migrants are in fact refugees, but see little benefit in seeking recognition.

====South Sudan====
{{main|Refugees of South Sudan}}

====Somalia====
[[File:Somyem2.jpg|thumb|Returning Somali expatriates in [[Bosaso]], Somalia (2015).]]
Following the outbreak of civil war in Somalia, many of the country's residents left in search of asylum. According to the UNHCR, there were around 976,500 registered refugees from the nation in adjacent states as of 2016.&lt;ref name="Unhcrreg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Registered Somali Refugee Population|url=http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/regional.php|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of these individuals were registered in [[Kenya]] (413,170: 326,611 in [[Dadaab]], 54,550 in [[Kakuma]], 32,009 in [[Nairobi]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registered Somali Refugee Population|url=http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/country.php?id=110|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yemen]] (253,876 in UNHCR centers and urban areas),&lt;ref name="Unhcrreg"/&gt; and [[Ethiopia]] (213,775 in five camps in [[Dolo Odo|Dollo Ado]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Registered Somali Refugee Population|url=http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/region.php?id=7&amp;country=65|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, 1.1 million people were internally displaced persons (IDPs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Refugees in the Horn of Africa: Somali Displacement Crisis|url=http://data.unhcr.org/horn-of-africa/country.php?id=197|publisher=UNHCR|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the IDPs were [[Bantus (Somalia)|Bantus]] and other ethnic minorities originating from the southern regions, including those displaced in the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia Humanitarian Situation Update|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06NAIROBI4868_a.html|website=Wikileaks|publisher=USAID|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 60% of the IDPs were children.&lt;ref name="Idmc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia IDP Figures Analysis|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/sub-saharan-africa/somalia/figures-analysis|publisher=IDMC|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of the displacement included armed violence, diverted aid flows and natural disasters, which hindered the IDPs' access to safe shelter and resources.&lt;ref name="Idmc2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Over a million IDPs need support for local solutions|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/assets/Uploads/201503-af-somalia-overview-en.pdf|publisher=IDMC|accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IDP settlements were concentrated in south-central Somalia (893,000), followed by the northern Puntland (129,000) and Somaliland (84,000) regions.&lt;ref name="Idmc"/&gt; Additionally, there were around 9,356 registered refugees and 11,157 registered asylum seekers in Somalia.&lt;ref name="Unhcrreg"/&gt; Most of these foreign nationals emigrated from Yemen to northern Somalia after the Houthi insurgency in 2015.&lt;ref name="Grfylibt"&gt;{{cite news|title=Refugees from Yemen Landed In Berabera Town|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=12416|accessdate=24 April 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that between 165,000 – 200,000 [[Sahrawis]] – people from the disputed territory of [[Western Sahara]] – have lived in five large refugee camps near [[Tindouf Province|Tindouf]] in the Algerian part of the [[Sahara]] Desert since 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/21380|title=EU donates 10 million to Western Sahara refugees|website=Afrol.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact2005/fields/2194.html|title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Field Listing - Refugees and internally displaced persons|website=Umsl.edu|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNHCR]] and [[WFP]] are presently engaged in supporting what they describe as the "90,000 most vulnerable" refugees, giving no estimate for total refugee numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/74134/western-sahara-lack-donor-funds-threatens-humanitarian-projects|title=Lack of donor funds threatens humanitarian projects|date=5 September 2007|website=IRIN|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{main|Refugees of the 2011 Libyan civil war}}
Refugees of the 2011 Libyan civil war are the people, predominantly of [[Libyans|Libyan nationality]], who fled or were expelled from their homes during the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], from within the borders of [[Libya]] to the neighbouring states of Tunisia, Egypt and Chad, as well as to European countries, across the Mediterranean, as [[Boat people]]. The majority of Libyan refugees are Arabs and Berbers, though many of other ethnicities, temporarily living in Libya, originated from sub-Saharan Africa, were also among the first refugee waves to exit the country. The total Libyan refugee numbers are estimated at near one million as of June 2011. About half of them had returned to Libyan territory during summer 2011, though large refugee camps on Tunisian and Chad border kept being overpopulated.

===Americas===

====El Salvador====
[[File:Desplazadoscol02.jpg|thumb|[[Colombia]]n refugees receiving humanitarian assistance.]]
More than one million [[Salvadoran]]s were displaced during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] from 1975 to 1982.  About half went to the United States, most settling in the Los Angeles area.

====Guatemala====
There was also a large exodus of [[Guatemala]]ns during the 1980s, trying to escape from the civil war there as well.  These people went to Southern Mexico and the U.S.

====Haiti====
From 1991 through 1994, following the military [[coup d'état]] against President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], thousands of [[Haiti]]ans fled violence and repression by boat. Although most were repatriated to Haiti by the U.S. government, others entered the United States as refugees. Haitians were primarily regarded as [[economic migrant]]s from the grinding poverty of Haiti, the poorest nation in the [[Western Hemisphere]].

====Cuba====
{{See also|Mariel boatlift}}
The victory of the forces led by [[Fidel Castro]] in the [[Cuban Revolution]] led to a large exodus of [[Cubans]] between 1959 and 1980. Thousands of Cubans yearly continue to risk the waters of the [[Straits of Florida]] seeking better economic and political conditions in the U.S. In 1999 the highly publicized case of six-year-old [[Elián González]] brought the covert migration to international attention. Measures by both governments have attempted to address the issue. The U.S. government instituted a [[wet feet, dry feet policy]] allowing refuge to those travelers who manage to complete their journey, and the Cuban government has periodically allowed for mass migration by organizing leaving posts. The most famous of these agreed migrations was the [[Mariel boatlift]] of 1980.

====Colombia====
[[Colombia]] has one of the world's largest populations of [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), with estimates ranging from 2.6 to 4.3 million people, due to the ongoing [[Colombian armed conflict]]. The larger figure is cumulative since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/lib.nsf/db900sid/ASHU-7RR7QG/$file/IDMC_Apr2009.pdf?openelement|format=PDF|title=Internal Displacement.

Source: United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 4 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now estimated by the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]] that there are about 150,000 [[Colombian people|Colombians]] in "refugee-like situations" in the United States, not recognized as refugees or subject to any formal protection.

====United States====
{{main|Asylum in the United States}}
[[File:Mariel Refugees.jpg|thumb|right|A boat crowded with [[Cuba]]n refugees arrives in [[Key West, Florida]], during the 1980 [[Mariel Boatlift]].]]
During the [[Vietnam War]], many U.S. citizens who were [[conscientious objectors]] and wished to [[draft dodger#Draft dodging and the Vietnam War|avoid the draft]] sought political asylum in Canada.  President [[Jimmy Carter]] issued an [[amnesty]]. Since 1975, the U.S. has resettled approximately 2.6 million refugees, with nearly 77% being either Indochinese or citizens of the former Soviet Union. Since the enactment of the Refugee Act of 1980, annual admissions figures have ranged from a high of 207,116 in 1980 to a low of 27,100 in 2002.

Currently, nine national [[VOLAG|voluntary agencies]] resettle refugees nationwide on behalf of the U.S. government: [[Church World Service]], Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]], [[International Rescue Committee]], [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]], Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], and [[World Relief]].

[[Jesuit Refugee Service|Jesuit Refugee Service/USA]] (JRS/USA) has worked to help resettle Bhutanese refugees in the United States. The mission of JRS/USA is to accompany, serve and defend the rights of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons.

From the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] in 1979 until the late 2001 [[Operation Enduring Freedom|U.S.-led invasion]], a total of six million [[Afghan nationality law|citizens of Afghanistan]] have migrated to neighboring parts of [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]].

=====The Partition of 1947=====
{{Main|Partition of India}}
[[File:Partition of Punjab, India 1947.jpg|thumb|Overcrowded train transferring refugees during the [[partition of India]], 1947. This was considered to be the largest migration in human history.]]

The partition of the [[British Raj]] provinces of [[Punjab region|Panjab]] and [[Bengal]] and the subsequent independence of Pakistan and one day later of India in 1947 resulted in the largest human movement in history. In this population exchange, approximately 7 million [[Hindus]] and [[Sikhs]] from [[Bangladesh]] and Pakistan moved to India while approximately 7 million Muslims from India moved to Pakistan. Approximately one million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs died during this event.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=====Bangladeshis=====
As a result of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], on 27 March 1971, Prime Minister of India, [[Indira Gandhi]], expressed full support of her Government to the Bangladeshi struggle for freedom. The Bangladesh-India border was opened to allow panic-stricken Bangladeshis' safe shelter in India. The governments of [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]], [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Tripura]] established refugee camps along the border. Exiled Bangladeshi army officers and the Indian military immediately started using these camps for recruitment and training members of [[Mukti Bahini]]. During the Bangladesh War of Independence around 10 million Bangladeshis fled the country to escape the killings and [[1971 Bangladesh atrocities|atrocities]] committed by the Pakistan Army.
Bangladeshi refugees are known as '"Chakmas"' in India. Other than chakmas there are Bengali Hindu refugee are also there who remain in India after war.

=====Sri Lankans=====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Black July 13 – from Commons.jpg|thumb|Tamil refugees disembarking in Jaffna. [[Black July]], 1983.]] --&gt;

The [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war]] in [[Sri Lanka]], from 1983 to 2009 had generated thousands of internally displaced people as well as refugees most of them being the [[Tamil people|Tamils]]. Many Sri Lankans have fled to neighbourly India and western countries such as Canada, France, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Germany.

While successive policies of discrimination and intimidation of the [[Tamils]] drove thousands to flee seeking asylum, the brutal end to the Civil War and the ongoing repression have forced a wave of thousands of refugees migrate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solidarity.net.au/48/sri-lanka%E2%80%99s-repression-brings-boats-of-tamil-refugees-to-australia/ |title=Solidarity Online &amp;#124; Sri Lanka's repression brings boats of Tamil refugees to Australia |publisher=Solidarity.net.au |date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to countries like Canada, the UK and especially Australia. Australia in particular, receives hundreds of refugees every month.

About 69,000 Sri Lankan Tamil refugees live in 112 camps in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;69,000 Sri Lankan refugees live in 112 camps in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Jammu and Kashmir=====
According to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), about 300,000 Hindu [[Kashmiri Pandits]] have been forced to leave the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] due to Islamic militancy and religious discrimination from the Muslim majority, making them refugees in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/opinion/2012/jan/190112-opinion-Kashmiri-Pandits-The-Forgotten-Victims.htm |title=Columnists |publisher=Mid-day.com |date= |accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have found refuge in [[Jammu]] and its adjoining areas, while others in camps in [[Delhi]] and others in other states of India and other countries too. Kashmiri groups peg the number of migrants closer to 500,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/in.html India], ''The World Factbook''. Retrieved 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biharis====
During the period of united Pakistan (1947–1971), the [[Urdu]]-speaking [[Biharis]] did not assimilate into the society of Bangladesh and have remained a distinct cultural-linguistic group ever since. after the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 the different linguistic group was assaulted by Bengalis because of their{{who|date=August 2017}} active participation with the Pakistani armed forces in committing genocide over the local populace. Some atrocities took place against Biharis. At the end of the war many Biharis took shelter in refugee camps in different cities, the biggest being the Geneva Camp in [[Dhaka]]. It is estimated that about 250,000 Biharis are living in those camps and in Rangpur and Dinajpur districts today. after 1971 many have still been living in Bangladesh while opting to be a repatriated to Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

====Rohingyas====
{{See also|2015 Rohingya refugee crisis}}
[[File:Gathering of IDPs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tamil people|Tamil]] refugees in [[Sri Lanka]].]]
[[Bangladesh]] hosts more than 250,000 Muslim [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugees who were forced out of their homes in western [[Burma]] (Myanmar) and fled in 1991-92 in order to escape persecution by the Burmese military junta.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2012/0612/Why-deadly-race-riots-could-rattle-Myanmar-s-fledgling-reforms Why deadly race riots could rattle Myanmar's fledgling reforms]". ''The Christian Science Monitor''. 12 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many have lived there for close to twenty years.  The Bangladeshi government divides the Rohingya into two categories – recognized refugees living in official camps and unrecognized refugees living in unofficial sites or among Bangladeshi communities.  Around 30,000 Rohingyas are residing in two camps in the Nayapara and Kutupalong areas of the [[Cox's Bazar]] district in Bangladesh. These camp residents have access to basic services, those outside do not.  With no changes inside Burma in sight, Bangladesh must come to terms with the long-term needs of all the Rohingya refugees in the country, and allow international organizations to expand services that benefit the Rohingya as well as local communities.

The agency has been supporting Rohingya refugees staying in the camps. On the other hand, it is not receiving applications for refugee status from the newly arrived Rohingyas. This amounts to a compromise of its mandate.
The brutal campaign of [[ethnic cleansing]] against Muslims in Arakan State by the Burmese military in 1991-92 caused a refugee crisis in which thousands of people have been detained in crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh and tens of thousands of others have been repatriated to Burma where they face further repression. There are widespread allegations of [[religious persecution]], use of forced labor and denial of citizenship to many Rohingya who were forced to return to Burma since 1996.
Many have again fled to Bangladesh in order to seek work or shelter, or to flee from Burmese military oppression, and some are forced across the border by Burmese security forces. In the past few months, abuses against Rohingya in [[Arakan State]] have continued, including strict registration laws that continue to deny Rohingya citizenship, restrictions on their movement, land confiscation and forced evictions to make way for Buddhist Burmese settlements, widespread forced labor in infrastructure projects and the closure of some mosques, including nine in the North Buthidaung Township of Western Arakan State in the last half of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refintl.org/blog/photo-report/luck-draw-rohingya-refugees-bangladesh|title=Luck of the Draw: Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh|website=Refintl.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2007/03/26/rohingya-refugees-burma-mistreated-bangladesh|title=Rohingya Refugees from Burma Mistreated in Bangladesh|date=27 March 2007|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rohingya.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=191&amp;Itemid=28|title=Web site of Arakan Rohingya National Organisation|website=Rohingya.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 90,000 people were displaced in the 2012 [[2012 Rakhine State riots|sectarian violence]] between Rohingya Muslims and Buddhists in Burma's western [[Rakhine State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18517412 | title=Burma unrest: UN body says 90,000 displaced by violence |publisher=BBC | date=20 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also large numbers of Muslim [[Burmese people in Pakistan|Rohingya refugees]] in Pakistan. Most of them have made perilous journeys across [[Bangladesh]] and India and settled in [[Karachi]].

====Nepal====
{{Main|Bhutanese refugees|Refugees in Nepal}}
[[File:Lotshampa refugees in Beldangi Camp.jpg|thumb|[[Bhutan]]ese of [[Nepal]]i origin who fled to Nepal in the early 1990s.]]
After the [[1959 Tibetan exodus]], there are more than 150,000 [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] who live in Nepal. These include people who have escaped over the [[Himalayas]] from [[Tibet]], as well as their children and grandchildren. In Nepal the overwhelming majority of Tibetans born in Nepal are still stateless and carry a document called an Identity Card issued by the Nepalese government in lieu of a passport. This document states the nationality of the holder as Tibetan. It is a document that is frequently rejected as a valid travel document by many customs and immigrations departments. The Tibetan refugees also own a [[Green Book (Tibetan document)|Green Book]] issued by the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] for rights and duties towards this administration.

In 1991–92, Bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 ethnic [[People of Nepal|Nepalis]] known as [[Lhotshampa]]s from the southern part of the country. Most of them have been living in seven refugee camps run by UNHCR in eastern Nepal ever since. In March 2008, this population began a multiyear resettlement to other countries including the United States, New Zealand, Denmark, Canada, Norway and Australia. At present, the United States is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these refugees in the US as a third country settlement programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm | title = Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' | author = Bhaumik, Subir | date = 7 November 2007 | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, as many as 200,000 Nepalese were displaced during the [[Maoist]] insurgency and [[Nepalese Civil War]] which ended in 2006.

By 2009, more than 3 million civilians had been displaced by the [[War in North-West Pakistan]] (2004–present).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/05/30/34-million-displaced-by-Pakistan-fighting/UPI-68801243704876/ 3.4 million displaced by Pakistan fighting].

Since 1991, much of the country's non-Muslim population, including non-ethnic Tajikistan's Russians and [[Bukharian Jew]]s, have fled [[Tajikistan]] due to severe poverty, instability and [[Tajikistan Civil War]] (1992–1997). In 1992, most of the country's Jewish population was evacuated to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishsf.com/bk960906/iend.htm|title=For Jews in Tajikistan, the end of history is looming|website=Jewishsf.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ethnic Russian population fled to Russia.

====Southeast Asia (Vietnam War)====
{{main|Indochina refugee crisis}}

[[File:35 Vietnamese boat people 2.JPEG|thumb|170px|right|[[Vietnam]]ese boat people, 1984.]]
Following the communist takeovers in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in 1975, about three million people attempted to escape in the subsequent decades. With massive influx of refugees daily, the resources of the receiving countries were severely strained. The plight of the [[boat people]] became an international humanitarian crisis. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) set up refugee camps in neighboring countries to process the boat people. The budget of the UNHCR increased from $80 million in 1975 to $500 million in 1980. Partly for its work in Indochina, the UNHCR was awarded the 1981 Nobel Peace Prize.
* Large numbers of Vietnamese refugees came into existence after 1975 when [[South Vietnam]] fell to the [[Vietnam People's Army|communist forces]]. Many tried to escape, some by boat, thus giving rise to the phrase "[[boat people]]". The Vietnamese refugees emigrated to Hong Kong, France, the United States, Canada, Australia, and other countries, creating sizeable expatriate communities, notably in the United States. Since 1975, an estimated 1.4 million refugees from Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries have been resettled to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?ID=585 Refugee Resettlement in Metropolitan America]".

* Survivors of the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime in [[Cambodia]] fled across the border into [[Thailand]] after the Vietnamese invasion of 1978–79.  Approximately 300,000 of these people were eventually resettled in the United States, France, Canada, and Australia between 1979 and 1992, when the camps were closed and the remaining people repatriated.
* Nearly 400,000 Laotians fled to Thailand after the [[Vietnam War]] and communist takeover in 1975. Some left because of persecution by the government for religious or ethnic purposes. Most left between 1976 and 1985 and lived in refugee camps along the border between [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]]. They mostly settled in the United States, Canada, France, and Australia. In the United States they mostly settled in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State, [[California]], Washington, D.C., [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], and [[Minnesota]].
* The Mien or [[Yao people|Yao]] recently lived in northern [[Vietnam]], northern [[Laos]] and northern [[Thailand]].

As a token of appreciation to the Mien and [[Hmong people]] who served in the [[CIA]] secret army, the United States accepted many of the refugees as [[Naturalization|naturalized]] [[Citizenship|citizens]] ([[Mien American]]).

====Jewish refugees====
{{Further|Jewish refugees}}
[[File:Bermuda conference - april 1943.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bermuda Conference]]]]
Between the first and second world wars, hundreds of thousands of European Jews, mainly from Germany and Austria attempted to flee
the German government's [[anti-semitic]] policies which culminated in the [[Holocaust]] and the mass murder of millions of European Jews. These Jews were often found it difficult or impossible to immigrate to other European countries. The 1938 [[Evian Conference]], the 1943 [[Bermuda Conference]] and other attempts failed to resolve the problem of Jewish refugees, a fact widely used in [[Nazi propaganda]] (see also [[MS St. Louis|MS ''St. Louis'']]).

Since its founding at the beginning of the 1900s Jewish immigration to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] was encouraged by the nascent [[zionism|Zionist movement]], but immigration was restricted by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government, under the pressure from [[Palestinian Arabs]]. Following its formation in 1948, according to [[1947 UN Partition Plan]], Israel adopted the [[Law of Return]], granting Israeli citizenship to any Jewish immigrant. Mass rioting and attacks on Jews throughout the Muslim World following the creation of the state of Israel led to the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], in which 850,000 Jews fled to Israel between 1948 and the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/VideoLibrary/Pages/Jewish-refugees-from-Arab-lands.aspx|title=VI- 30 November: Commemorating the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands|website=Mfa.org.il|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoge"&gt;{{cite news |title=Group seeks justice for 'forgotten' Jews |first=Warren |last=Hoge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/world/americas/04iht-nations.4.8182206.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====European Union====
According to the [[European Council on Refugees and Exiles]], a network of European refugee-assisting [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), huge differences exist between national asylum systems in Europe, making the asylum system a 'lottery' for refugees. For example, Iraqis who flee their home country and end up in Germany have an 85% chance of being recognised as a refugee and those who apply for asylum in Slovenia do not get a protection status at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecre.org/topics/asylum_in_EU|title=European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) – Asylum in the EU|website=Ecre.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom the [[Asylum Support Partnership]] was created to enable all the agencies working to support and assist [[asylum seeker]]s in making asylum claims was established in 2012 and is part funded by the home office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/what_we_do/working_with_partners/asp |title=Working with partners - Asylum Support Partnership |publisher=Refugeecouncil.org.uk |date= |accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In 2010, President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] began the systematic dismantling of illegal [[Romani people|Romani]] camps and squats in France, deporting thousands of Roma residing in France illegally to [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]] or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11027288 | publisher=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: France Roma expulsions | date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
Since the 1980s Spain has transitioned from a country whose people emigrated to other countries to one of immigration. Immigrants coming into Spain are categorized and ranked by their country of origin according to Spanish immigration law. Depending on the individual's origin country they can receive “preferred” status over other immigrants who are given “outsider” status due to their country of origin, such as [[Third World|Third World countries]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calavita|first=Kitty|date=1998|title=Immigration, Law, and Marginalization in a Global Economy: Notes from Spain|jstor=827756|journal=Law &amp; Society Review|volume=32|issue=3|pages=529–566|doi=10.2307/827756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain has also added more steps to their asylum procedures, which some critics feel makes it too difficult for refugee and asylum seekers to enter and as such serves as a deterrence tool that violates Spain's international obligation to protect this group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fullerton|first=Maryellen|date=1 December 2005|title=Inadmissible in Iberia: The Fate of Asylum Seekers in Spain and Portugal|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/ijrl/eei039|journal=International Journal of Refugee Law|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=659–687|doi=10.1093/ijrl/eei039|issn=0953-8186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ángeles|first=Ortega, María|last2=Celia|first2=Ruiz,|date=2016|title="Vidas a la deriva : la ruptura del sueño europeo".

Since 2014 the number of refugees seeking asylum in Spain has increased greatly and Spain has received criticism for what has been perceived as a failure to keep up with these numbers. Spain has offered to provide asylum to 17,337 refugees by September 2017, however, only 744 of which were extended asylum status in the country by July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bris|first=Pablo|last2=Bendito|first2=Félix|date=17 August 2017|title=Lessons Learned from the Failed Spanish Refugee System: For the Recovery of Sustainable Public Policies|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/8/1446|journal=Sustainability|language=en|volume=9|issue=8|pages=1446|doi=10.3390/su9081446}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the [[Pew Research Center]] found that from July 2015 to May 2016 there was an increase in percentage point of the refugee population in many European countries, however Spain was one of the few that experienced a decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/12/15/international-migration-key-findings-from-the-u-s-europe-and-the-world/#|title=International migration: Key findings from the U.S., Europe and the world|date=15 December 2016|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=22 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty with refugees successfully immigrating to Spain has led to some researchers such as [[Kitty Calavita]] to suggest that the country's marginalization and social and economic exclusion are primarily produced by law, rather than culture.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

====Hungary====
In 1956–57 following the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] nearly 200,000 persons, about two percent of the population of Hungary, fled as refugees to Austria and [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/photos?set=hungarian_refugees The Lives of the Hungarian Refugees], UNHCR&lt;/ref&gt;

====Czechoslovakia====
The [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in 1968 was followed by a wave of emigration, unseen before. It stopped shortly after (estimate: 70,000 immediately, 300,000 in total).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britskelisty.cz/9808/19980821h.html "Day when tanks destroyed Czech dreams of Prague Spring" (''Den, kdy tanky zlikvidovaly české sny Pražského jara'') at Britské Listy (British Letters)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southeastern Europe====
Following the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946–1949) hundreds of thousands of Greeks and Ethnic Macedonians were expelled or fled the country. The number of refugees ranged from 35,000 to over 213,000. Over 28,000 children were evacuated by the Partisans to the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. This left thousands of [[Greeks]] and [[Aegean Macedonians]] spread across the world.

The [[forced assimilation]] campaign of the late 1980s directed against ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] resulted in the emigration of some 300,000 [[Turks in Bulgaria|Bulgarian Turks]] to Turkey.
[[File:Evstafiev-travnik-refugees.jpg|thumb|Refugees arrive in [[Travnik]], central [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], during the [[Yugoslav wars]], 1993.]]
Beginning in 1991, political upheavals in [[Southeastern Europe]] such as the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]], displaced about 2,700,000 people by mid-1992, of which over 700,000 of them sought asylum in [[European Union member states]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/specials/bosnia/context/dayton.html|title=Bosnia: Dayton Accords|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=Resettling Refugees: U.N.

Today there are still thousands of refugees and internally [[displaced person]]s in Southeastern Europe who cannot return to their homes. Most of them are [[Serbs]] who cannot return to [[Kosovo]], and who still live in refugee camps in Serbia today.

In 2009, between 7% and 7.5% of [[Serbia]]'s population were refugees and IDPs. Around 500,000 refugees, mainly from Croatia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], arrived following the [[Yugoslav wars]].

====Russia====
{{main|Chechen refugees}}
Since 1992, ongoing conflict has taken place in the [[North Caucasus]] region of Russia. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[Chechnya]] broke away and [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|became a ''de facto'' independent state]]. This move was not recognized by the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], which invaded, leading to the [[First Chechen War|first Chechen war]]. As a consequence, about 2 million people have been displaced and still cannot return to their homes. Due to widespread lawlessness and ethnic cleansing under the government of [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] most non-Chechens (and many [[Chechen people|Chechens]] as well) fled the country during the 1990s or were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chechnyaadvocacy.org/refugees.html|title=Chechnya Advocacy Network|website=Chechnyaadvocacy.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2369902|title=Ethnic Russians in the North of Caucasus – Eurasia Daily Monitor|website=Jamestown.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near and Middle East===

====Population exchange between Greece and Turkey====
The 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] was stemmed from the "[[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]" signed at [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], on 30 January 1923, by the governments of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and the Republic of [[Turkey]]. It involved approximately 2 million people (around 1.5 million [[Greeks in Turkey|Anatolian Greeks]] and 500,000 Muslims in Greece), most of whom were forcibly made refugees and ''[[de jure]]'' denaturalized from their homelands.

By the end of 1922, the vast majority of native [[Ottoman Greeks|Asia Minor Greeks]] had already fled the [[Greek genocide]] (1914–1922) and Greece's later defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibney, Matthew J. (2004), ''"The Ethics and Politics of Asylum: Liberal Democracy and the Response to Refugees"'', [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to some calculations, during the autumn of 1922, around 900,000 Greeks arrived in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaos Andriotis (2008). Chapter ''The refugees question in Greece (1821–1930)'', in "''Θέματα Νεοελληνικής Ιστορίας''", ΟΕΔΒ (''"Topics from Modern Greek History"''). 8th edition&lt;/ref&gt; The population exchange was envisioned by Turkey as a way to formalize, and make permanent, the exodus of Greeks from Turkey, while initiating a new exodus of a smaller number of Muslims from Greece to supply settlers for occupying the newly depopulated regions of Turkey, while Greece saw it as a way to supply its masses of new propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey with lands to settle from the exchanged Muslims of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Howland, Charles P. [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/68710/charles-p-howland/greece-and-her-refugees "Greece and Her Refugees"], ''Foreign Affairs,'' [[The Council on Foreign Relations]]. July 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

This major compulsory [[Population transfer|population exchange]], or agreed mutual expulsion, was based not on language or ethnicity, but upon religious identity, and involved nearly all the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]] citizens of Turkey, including its [[Karamanlides|native Turkish-speaking Orthodox]] citizens, and most of the [[Muslim]] citizens of Greece, including its native [[Greek Muslim|Greek-speaking Muslim]] citizens.

====Palestinians====
{{Further|Palestinian refugees}}
[[File:Palestinian refugees.jpg|thumb|Palestinian refugees leaving the Galilee in October–November 1948]]
A heavy exodus of the non-Jewish population of Palestine took place in 1948. Though usually described as byproduct of the [[1948 Palestine war]], the first and largest wave of Palestinian refugees took place in early 1948, shortly after the [[Deir Yassin massacre]]—preceding, therefore, said war,&lt;ref name=AviS&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shlaim|first1=Avi|title=The Iron Wall|trans-title=Israel and the Arab World|year=2001|publisher=W.

According to files belonging to the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli army]] that came under the attention of Israeli historians such as [[Benny Morris]], the overwhelming majority (about 73%) of Palestinian refugees left as a result of actions undertaken by Zionist militias and Jewish authorities, with a smaller percentage, about 5%, leaving voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benny (1986): "The Causes and Character of the Arab Exodus from Palestine: The Israel Defense Forces Intelligence Branch Analysis of June 1948."

Dispossession and displacement of Palestinians continued in the decades after Israel's independence, and renewal of conflicts between Israel and its neighbors. During the 1967 war, about 400,000 Palestinians, half of whom were 1948 refugees, fled their lands in the West Bank following advances by the Israeli army and settled in Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Children of Palestine: Experiencing Forced Migration in the Middle East|year=2005|publisher=British Library|isbn=1845450108|page=23|author1=Dawn Chatty|author2=Gillian Lewando Hundt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, Israel blacklisted the refugees from that war to impede them from returning and reclaiming their properties and lands, which have been allocated to Jewish settlements and Israeli military bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ministry admits 'blacklist' of Palestinians who left West Bank during Six-Day War|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/ministry-admits-blacklist-of-palestinians-who-left-west-bank-during-six-day-war-1.192233|date=5 July 2006|accessdate=13 October 2013|author=Akiva Eldar |work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel has also admitted to revoking the residency rights of 250,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories in the period between 1967 and 1994, the year of the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, after they left temporarily to study and work abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel admits it revoked residency rights of a quarter million Palestinians|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-admits-it-revoked-residency-rights-of-a-quarter-million-palestinians-1.435778|date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013|author=Akiva Eldar|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian refugees and their descendents spread throughout the Arab world; the largest populations are found in neighboring Levantine countries—Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. The populations of the West Bank and Gaza are also composed to a large extent of refugees and their descendents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/UN/unrwa6.html|title=United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA): Palestinian Refugees in Gaza Strip|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1967, the West Bank and Gaza were officially ruled, respectively, by Jordan and Egypt.  Jordan's Hashemite Kingdom was the only Arab government to have granted citizenship to Palestinian refugees.

Palestinian refugees from 1948 and their descendants do not come under the 1951 UN [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]], but under the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]], which created its own criteria for refugee classification. The great majority of Palestinian refugees have kept the refugee status for generations, under a special decree of the UN,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10.html|title=Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|website=Unhcr.org|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3ae6b3314.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029015803/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/3ae6b3314.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and legally defined to include descendants of refugees, as well as others who might otherwise be considered [[internally displaced person]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

As of December 2005, the World Refugee Survey of the [[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]] estimates the total number of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to be 2,966,100. [[Palestinian refugees]] number almost half of Jordan's population, however they have assimilated into Jordanian society, having a full citizenship. In Syria, though not officially becoming citizens, most of the Palestinian refugees were granted resident rights and issued travel documents. Following the Oslo Agreements, attempts were made to integrate the displaced Palestinians and their descendants into the Palestinian community. In addition, Israel granted permissions for family reunions and return of only about 10,000 Fatah members to the West Bank. The refugee situation and the presence of [[List of Palestinian refugee camps|numerous refugee camps]] continues to be a point of contention in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

The [[Palestinian exodus from Kuwait (Gulf War)|Palestinian exodus from Kuwait]] took place during and after the [[Gulf War]]. There were 400,000 Palestinians in Kuwait before the Gulf War. During the Gulf War, more than 200,000 Palestinians fled Kuwait during the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi occupation of Kuwait]] due to harassment and intimidation by [[Iraqi security forces]],&lt;ref name="ir"/&gt; in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait.&lt;ref name=ir&gt;{{cite web|author=Shafeeq Ghabra|title=The PLO in Kuwait|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/1457|date=8 May 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Gulf War in 1991, Kuwaiti authorities pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait.&lt;ref name=ppp&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven J.

[[Mizrahi Jews in Israel|They and their descendants]] make up the majority of [[Israeli Jews]].

A number of small-scale Jewish exoduses began in many Middle Eastern countries early in the 20th century with the only substantial [[aliyah]] coming from Yemen and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Reeva S. Simon, Michael M. Laskier, Sara Reguer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bW7aNxCGDKQC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times], 2003, p. 327="Before the 1940s only two communities, Yemen and Syria, made substantial aliyah."&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of Israel]] in 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands that now make up the [[Arab world]]. Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French and Italian-controlled [[North Africa]], 15–20% in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], approximately 10% in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and approximately 7% in the [[Kingdom of Yemen]]. A further 200,000 lived in [[Pahlavi Iran]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily from Iraq, Yemen and Libya. In these cases over 90% of the Jewish population left, despite the necessity of leaving their property behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aharoni|first= Ada|url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/w91udxrhc7cf5a86|title=The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries|journal= Peace Review: A Journal of Social Justice |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |volume=15 |pages=53–60 |ref=harv |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/1040265032000059742}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hundred and sixty thousand Jews from Arab countries immigrated to [[Israel]] between 1948 and 1951, accounting for 56% of the total immigration to the newly founded state.&lt;ref name=colin63&gt;Shindler, Colin.

Later waves peaked at different times in different regions over the subsequent decades. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 following the [[Suez Crisis]]. The exodus from the other North African Arab countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of Jews from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. Six hundred thousand Jews from Arab and Muslim countries had reached Israel by 1972.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adi-schwartz.com/israeli-arab-conflict/all-i-wanted-was-justice/|title=All I Wanted was Justice|last=Schwartz|first=Adi|date=4 January 2008|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulewitz&gt;Malka Hillel Shulewitz, ''The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands'', Continuum 2001, pp. 139 and 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aharoni&gt;Ada Aharoni [http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm "The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213230126/http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm |date=13 February 2012 }}, Historical Society of Jews from Egypt website.

Israel destroyed 139 Syrian villages in the occupied territory of the [[Golan Heights]] and 130,000 of its residents fled or were expelled from their lands, which now serve the purpose of settlements and military bases.

The [[Iran–Iraq War]] from 1980 to 1988, the 1990 [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]], the first [[Gulf War]] and subsequent conflicts all generated hundreds of thousands if not millions of refugees. Iran also provided asylum for 1,400,000 Iraqi refugees who had been uprooted as a result of the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq]] (1990–91).

=====Refugees in Jordan=====
[[File:An Aerial View of the Za'atri Refugee Camp.jpg|thumb|Za'atri camp for Syrian refugees in Jordan]]
[[Jordan]] has one of the world's largest immigrant populations{{when|date=August 2017}}  with some sources putting the immigrant percentage to being 60%. [[Iraqi refugees]] number between 750,000 and 1 million in Jordan with most living in Amman.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Jordan also has Armenian, Chechen, Circassian minorities, and about half of its population is said to be of Palestinian refugees and their descendants.

====Syrian refugees====

To escape the violence, nearly 4,088,078 Syrian refugees{{when|date=August 2017}} have fled the country to neighboring Jordan, [[Lebanon]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php Syria Regional Refugee Response – Demographic Data of Registered Population].

====African refugees in Israel====
[[File:There Are No Illegal Children!.jpg|thumb|Demonstration against the expulsion of refugees and their families from Israel in Tel Aviv, 2009]]
Since 2003, an estimated 70,000 [[Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel|immigrants arrived illegally]] from various African countries into Israel.&lt;ref name="ARDC"&gt;African Refugee Development Center. Retrieved 11 November 2011, [http://www.ardc-israel.org/en/about/refugees/ African Refugee Development Center] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206094843/http://www.ardc-israel.org/en/about/refugees/ |date=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 600 [[Sudanese refugees in Israel|refugees]] from the Darfur region of Sudan have been granted temporary resident status that is to be renewed every year, although not official refugee status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acri.org.il/pdf/refugees0209en.pdf|title=ACRI.org.il|website=Acri.org.il|accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2,000 refugees from the conflict between [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]] have been granted temporary resident status on humanitarian grounds. Israel prefers not to recognize them as refugees so as not to offend Eritrea and Ethiopia. The Sudanese, who are from an enemy state, are also not recognized as refugees. In effect, Israeli politicians, including the current prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], have referred to the refugees as a threat to Israel's "Jewish character".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Netanyahu: Illegal African immigrants – a threat to Israel's Jewish character|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/netanyahu-illegal-african-immigrants-a-threat-to-israel-s-jewish-character-1.302653

Over the past years, conflicts have occurred between Israelis and African immigrants in southern Tel-Aviv, mostly due to poverty issues on both sides. Locals accuse African immigrants of rape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/law/1.1710228 |title=חשד: אריתראים אנסו קטינה בת 15 בדרום תל אביב - משפט ופלילים - הארץ |publisher=Haaretz.co.il |date= |accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stealing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4239481,00.html |title=The dark side of Tel Aviv - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= |accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and assault, making racial issues emerge in the southern part of Tel-Aviv, which became an immigrant-populated area.

In 2012, Reuters reported that Israel may jail "illegal immigrants" for up to three years under a [[Israeli policy for Sudanese and Eritrean refugees | law]] put into effect to stem the flow of Africans across the desert border with Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFBRE8520DX20120603 |title=Israel to jail illegal migrants for up to 3 years |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Netanyahu said in effect that, "If we don't stop their entry, the problem that currently stands at 60,000 could grow to 600,000, and that threatens our existence as a uniquely Jewish and democratic state."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/20/israel-netanyahu-african-immigrants-jewish Israel PM: illegal African immigrants threaten identity of Jewish state]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2221">'''René Renou''' (1952 – 19 June 2006) was president of the [[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine]] (INAO) at the time of his death and was "one of the most influential men in French winemaking.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.decanter.com/news/87087.html |title=Head of INAO, Rene Renou, dies |first=Jane |last=Anson |date=20 June 2006 |website=[[Decanter.com]] |access-date=24 April 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701054322/http://www.decanter.com/news/87087.html |archive-date=1 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renou argued that France's ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) system was hindering the country's competitiveness in the world wine market. He said that the AOC system was "conceived for producers rather than consumers", that there are too many AOCs, they are not meaningful, that they confuse consumers, and that reform was essential. His proposals for reform met strong resistance and defense of the [[status quo]].

''BettaneDesseauve'' named Renou Man of the Year in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wineindustryreport.finewinepress.com/2006/06/20/rene-renou/ |title=René Renou |date=20 June 2006 |website=Wine Industry Report |access-date=24 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142133/http://wineindustryreport.finewinepress.com/2006/06/20/rene-renou/ |archive-date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a Chevalier de la [[Legion of Honour|Légion d’Honneur]] and Commander in the [[Ordre du Mérite Agricole]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/winenews060620_3 |title=René Renou reaches the end of the road |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |date=20 June 2006 |website=JancisRobinson.com |access-date=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The René Renou winery is located in the [[Anjou (wine)|Anjou]] district of the [[Loire Valley (wine)|Loire Valley]] wine region, and makes wine from [[Coteaux du Layon]] and other AOCs.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:SamYbarra.jpg|thumb|200px|Ybarra beneath sandbags]] --&gt;'''Sam Ybarra''' (1945-1982) was a [[United States Army]] soldier who served in the [[Tiger Force]] commando unit attached to the [[101st Airborne Division]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. He is notable for alleged involvement in warcrimes alongside the Tiger Force unit.

Ybarra was born and raised on the [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation]] in [[Arizona]] to a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] father and an [[Apache people|Apache]] mother. When he was five, his father died in a bar brawl, and after that he was raised by his mother. He attended [[Globe High School]] in [[Globe, Arizona]], and was arrested four times as a teenager for disturbing the peace and underage drinking.

Ybarra enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1966, along with his childhood friend Kenneth Green, and the friends were attached to the Tiger Force unit. Both he and Green committed atrocities against Vietnamese civilians during the war, and engaged in the Tiger Force practice of cutting off trophy ears from their victims.

Ybarra was noted by the ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' magazine as having recorded the 1000th kill of [[Operation Wheeler/Wallowa|Operation Wheeler]].

Green was killed on September 29, 1967, and other Tiger Force soldiers claim that it threw Ybarra over the edge, as he vowed to avenge his friend's death. As a result, he became the unit's worst killer, and had to be transferred out of the unit to an artillery company in early 1968. Ybarra went on to be [[court martial]]ed for insubordination, and was dishonorably discharged in late 1968. He would later be named in 7 of the 30 allegations that the Army would later investigate the unit for.

Once discharged, Ybarra could not be compelled to testify to the investigations against him, and declined three times. He died of pneumonia in 1982, at age 37, living with his mother on the San Carlos Apache Reservation in Arizona, reportedly contrite and depressed over his role in the war.

The '''seventy disciples''' or '''seventy-two disciples''' (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the '''Seventy[-two] Apostles''') were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to ({{bibleref2|Luke|10:1}}) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521–524; 543–545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''. Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] is the only current one to use [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]] as a title for a priesthood office.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=25|showsource=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==

The passage from [[Luke 10]] reads (in [[Young's Literal Translation]]):{{quote|
And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come, then said he unto them, `The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.

`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves; carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;  and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house; and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back. `And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from house to house, and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you, and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.

`And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say, And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you; and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. `Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed; but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you. `And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down. `He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'

And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, `Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;' and he said to them, `I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen; lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you; but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–20|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Analysis ==
This is the only mention of the group in the [[Bible]]. The number is ''seventy'' in some manuscripts of the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] (such as [[Codex Sinaiticus]]) and [[Caesarean text-type|Caesarean]] text traditions but ''seventy-two'' in most other Alexandrian and [[Western text-type|Western]] texts. It may derive from the [[Sons of Noah|seventy nations of Genesis 10]] or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the [[Septuagint]] from the [[Letter of Aristeas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek NT''&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the ''[[Vulgate]]'', [[Jerome]] selected the reading of seventy-two.

The ''Gospel of Luke'' is not alone among the [[synoptic gospels]] in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion ({{bibleref2|Luke|9:1–6}}) is closely based on the "limited commission" mission in ''[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]'' {{bibleref2|Mark|6:6–13}}, which however recounts the sending out of the [[twelve apostles]], rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|9:35}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:1}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:5–42}}) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized [[Q document]]. Luke also mentions the [[Great Commission]] to "all nations" ({{bibleref2|Luke|24:44–49}}) but in less detail than Matthew's account and {{bibleverse|Mark|16:19–20}} mentions the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]].

What has been said to the seventy (two) in {{bibleref2|Luke|10:4}} is referred in passing to the Twelve in {{bibleref2|Luke|22:35}}:
:He said to them, "When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?" "No, nothing," they replied.

The [[feast day]] commemorating the seventy is known as the "[[Synaxis]] of the Seventy Apostles" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on [[January 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 4]]. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the [[liturgical year]] (see [[Eastern Orthodox Church calendar]]).

== The record by Pseudo-Hippolytus ==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] was a disciple of [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]], a disciple of [[Apostle John]]. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on [[Mount Athos]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 3&lt;/ref&gt; While his major work ''The Refutation of All Heresies'' was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, ''On the Twelve Apostles of Christ'' and ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'', are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 254–56&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [[James the Just|James the Lord's brother]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Cleopas]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], who supplied the vacant place in the number of the twelve apostles.
# [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Thaddeus]], who conveyed the epistle to Augarus ([[Abgar V]]).
# [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]], who baptized Paul, and was bishop of Damascus.
# [[St Stephen|Stephen]], the first martyr.
# [[Philip the Evangelist|Philip]], who baptized the eunuch.
# [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], bishop of Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.
# [[Nicanor the Deacon|Nicanor]] died when Stephen was martyred.
# [[Timon the Deacon|Timon]], bishop of Bostra.
# [[Parmenas]], bishop of Soli.
# [[Nicolas the Deacon|Nicolaus]], bishop of Samaria.
# [[Barnabas]], bishop of Milan.
# [[Mark the Evangelist]], bishop of Alexandria.
# [[Luke the Evangelist]].
These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1706">'''Simon van den Bergh''' (October 26, 1819 in [[Geffen (Netherlands)|Geffen]] – April 6, 1907 in [[Rotterdam]]) was a Dutch businessperson. He founded a margarine factory in the Netherlands that became world-famous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MARGARINE KING DEAD.; Simon Vandenbergh Started in Business as a Small Shopkeeper |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A02E1DA1331E733A25753C1A9629C946697D6CF |work=New York Times |date=1907-04-10 |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1888, the same year his son [[Samuel van den Bergh|Samuel]] joined the company, he opened a factory in [[Kleve]], the ''Van den Bergh Margarine Works''. By announcing it was for the industrial manufacture of margarine, he was able to circumvent the high tariffs of the German Reich on butter and margarine. The factory introduced the Sanella brand in 1904, made from almond milk.

In the summer of 1929 (after the death of Simon van den Bergh) the Jurgens &amp; Prince Margarine Works in Goch and Van den Bergh in Kleve merged to become [[Margarine Unie]]. The newly merged company then combined with English soap manufacturer [[Lever Brothers]] to create the modern company [[Unilever]].

'''Susanna Cole''' (née '''Hutchinson'''; 1633 – before December 14, 1713) was the lone survivor of an American Indian attack in which many of her siblings were killed, as well as her famed mother [[Anne Hutchinson]].  She was taken captive following the attack and held for several years before her release.

Susanna Hutchinson was born in [[Alford, Lincolnshire|Alford]], [[Lincolnshire]], England and was less than a year old when her family sailed from England to [[New England]] in 1634.  She was less than five when her family settled on [[Aquidneck Island]] (later Rhode Island) in the [[Narragansett Bay]] following her mother's banishment from [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts]] during the [[Antinomian Controversy]].  Her father died when she was about eight years old, and she, her mother, and six of her siblings left Rhode Island to live in [[New Netherland]].  They settled in an area that became the far northeastern section of [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]], near the [[Westchester County]] line.  The family found themselves caught in the middle of [[Kieft's War]] between the local [[Siwanoy]] Indians and the colony of [[New Netherland]], and they were all massacred in August 1643, except for Susanna.  She was taken captive by the Indians, and was traded back to the English three years later.

When Susanna was released from her Indian captivity, she was taken to Boston where her oldest brother and an older sister lived, was re-introduced into English society, and married John Cole at the age of 18, the son of Boston innkeeper [[Samuel Cole (settler)|Samuel Cole]].  They lived in Boston for a few years, but moved by 1663 to the Narragansett country of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] (later [[North Kingstown]]) to look after the lands of her oldest brother [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward Hutchinson]].  Here the couple remained and raised a large family.  Susanna Cole was still alive in 1707 when given administration of her husband's estate, but was deceased by December 1713 when her son William took receipts concerning his parents' estate.

== Early life ==
Susanna Hutchinson was baptized in Alford, Lincolnshire on 15 November 1633. She was the youngest child of [[William Hutchinson (Rhode Island)|William]] and [[Anne Hutchinson]] to accompany her parents on the voyage from England to [[New England]] in 1634.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|p=481}}  She was the couple's 14th child, of whom 11 survived to make the trip to the [[New World]]; a 15th child was born in New England.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=477–81}}  The family settled in [[Boston]] and lived across the street from magistrate [[John Winthrop]], who was a judge during the civil trial in 1637 that led to her mother's banishment from the Massachusetts colony.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=73}}  While Hutchinson was still very young, her mother hosted popular religious discussions at their home.  Her mother's religious views were at odds with the orthodoxy of the [[Puritan]] ministers; she helped to create a major division in the Boston church and an untenable situation for the colony's leaders.{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|pp=44–5}}  The family was forced to leave Massachusetts; they settled with many of her mother's supporters on [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] in the [[Narragansett Bay]], establishing the settlement of [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]] which soon became a part of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]].{{sfn|Bicknell|1920|p=975}}  Susanna was less than five years old when the family left Boston, and she was about eight when her father died in Portsmouth.{{sfn|Anderson|2003|pp=479–82}}

Susanna's widowed mother was frightened at the prospect of Massachusetts gaining influence or control over Rhode Island. Consequently, she moved to the part of [[New Netherland]] that later became [[The Bronx]] in [[New York City]], along with her six youngest children, an older son, a son-in-law, and some servants.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=227}} The Dutch were engaged in [[Kieft's War]] against the [[Siwanoy]] Indians during the family's tenure there. In August 1643, Siwonoy attacked the emigrant household and killed all members of the family, except for nine year-old Susanna.  According to one story, Susanna's red hair spared her from the slaughter,{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|pp=3,11}} while another account claimed that the girl was out picking blueberries some distance from the house and hid in the crevice of [[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]].{{sfn|LaPlante|2004|p=239}} In any event, the attackers took her captive and held her for several years.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=228}}

[[File:SplitRock.EastFace.LookingWest.20110820.jpg|thumb|right|[[Split Rock (Bronx, New York)|Split Rock]], where one legend says that Susanna Hutchinson hid during the Indian massacre which killed her mother and siblings]]

Massachusetts governor [[John Winthrop]] provides an account of Susanna in his journal, under the date of July 1646:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A daughter of Mrs. Hutchinson was carried away by the Indians near the Dutch, when her mother and others were killed by them; and upon the peace concluded between the Dutch and the same Indians, she was returned to the Dutch governor, who restored her to her friends here.  She was about eight years old, when she was taken, and continued with them about four years, and she had forgot her own language, and all her friends, and was loath to have come from the Indians.{{sfn|Winthrop|1908|pp=276–277}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Winthrop says that Hutchinson was captive for about four years, although his journal makes clear that her captivity lasted less than three years.  When she returned to Boston, her living siblings were her oldest brother [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward]], brother Samuel, and her two oldest living sisters Faith (the wife of [[Thomas Savage (major)|Thomas Savage]]) and Bridget (the wife of [[John Sanford (governor)|John Sanford]]).{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=vi}} Faith lived in Mount Wollaston, about ten miles south of Boston; Bridget lived in Portsmouth, Rhode Island; and Samuel's residence is unknown. Only her brother Edward is known to have lived in Boston proper, and it is likely that Susanna came to live with him and his family.{{Sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=228}}{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  On 30 December 1651, she married John Cole in Boston, the son of Boston innkeeper [[Samuel Cole (settler)|Samuel Cole]], who had established Boston's first tavern in 1634.{{Sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|p=228}}{{sfn|Winthrop|1908|p=120}}

== Adult life ==

Susanna and John Cole began raising a family in Boston, but they went to look after her brother's land in the Narragansett country by 1663, which was then in disputed territory but later became [[North Kingstown]], [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]].{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  Here the Coles lived for the remainder of their lives, rearing many children.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  The will of John Cole's father Samuel Cole, dated 21 December 1666, left a property at Bendall's Dock in Boston to Susanna and her children to satisfy an agreement with Susanna's brother [[Edward Hutchinson (captain)|Edward Hutchinson]] and uncle [[Edward Hutchinson (mercer)#Samuel Hutchinson|Samuel Hutchinson]].{{sfn|Holman|1943|p=194}}  This property was leased out in 1676, and sold in 1698 for £160.{{sfn|Holman|1943|p=195}}

In April 1667, John Cole deeded their house in Boston to Susanna's brother Edward and uncle Samuel, signifying that they intended to remain in Narragansett.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  They lived in the vicinity of [[Wickford, Rhode Island|Wickford]], an area claimed by both [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and Rhode Island.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  Many of the Wickford inhabitants preferred to be under the jurisdiction of Connecticut, and John Cole became a magistrate and commissioner for the area in the late 1660s under the auspices of the Connecticut government.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}} Rhode Island was eventually given control over the Narragansett lands following many years of dispute and tension, and John Cole was made a conservator of the peace under the Rhode Island government in 1682.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}} John died by 1707, and Susanna and her son William were given administration of his estate during that year.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  Susanna died by 14 December 1713, and her son William "took receipts from heirs for their full proportion of estate of deceased father and mother."{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}

== Family and Legacy ==

Susanna and John Cole had 11 children: Susanna, Samuel, Mary, John, Ann, a second John, Hannah, William, Francis, Elizabeth, and Elisha; at least 9 of them grew to maturity.  Their oldest daughter Susanna married Thomas Eldred, but the fate is not known of their oldest son Samuel.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  Mary lived into her 60s, never marrying, and John Jr. died as a youngster.{{Sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  Ann married Henry Bull, the son of Jireh Bull, and grandson of Rhode Island colonial governor [[Henry Bull (governor)|Henry Bull]].{{sfn|Austin|1887|pp=264–5}}  A second John grew to maturity; Hannah married Thomas Place; and William married Ann Pinder.{{Sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  Francis grew to maturity; Elizabeth (1673-1744) married Robert Potter (1667-1745), grandson of original Rhode Island settler Nathaniel Potter (1616-1644); and Elisha married Elizabeth Dexter and was a Deputy or Assistant in the Rhode Island colony for many years.{{sfn|Austin|1887|p=50}}  Among her well-known descendants are two aspirants to the United States Presidency: [[Stephen Arnold Douglas]], who lost to [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 election]], and [[Willard Mitt Romney]], who lost to [[Barack Obama]] in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]].{{sfn|Family Search|2008}}  Her grandson [[John Cole (judge)|John Cole]], the son of Elisha Cole, was a chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court.

There have been numerous books and articles written about Susanna Cole's famous mother [[Anne Hutchinson]], most of which mention Susanna. The novel ''Trouble's Daughter'' by Katherine Kirkpatrick presents a fictionalized account about Susanna's life with the Indians who captured her, but it also presents some of the limited historical information that is available about her.{{sfn|Kirkpatrick|1998|pp=1–230}}

A bronze statue in front of the Massachusetts State House in Boston displays an assumed likeness of Cole as a youngster and her mother Anne Hutchinson; it was dedicated in 1922.{{sfn|Art Around the World|2007}}

== Ancestry ==

Some of Susanna's ancestry on her father's side was published by John D. Champlin in 1913, and he published much of her ancestry on her mother's side the following year.{{sfn|Champlin|1913|pp=2–3}}{{sfn|Champlin|1914|17–26}}

'''Terrence Andrew Davis''' (December 15, 1969 – August 11, 2018) was an American computer programmer known for creating the operating system [[TempleOS]], developing it alone over the course of a decade. In 1996, Davis began experiencing regular manic episodes, leading him to numerous stays at mental hospitals. Initially diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]], he was later declared [[schizophrenic]] and remained unemployed for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="VICE"/&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Terry A. Davis 1982 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Davis with his computer monitor]]
Davis was born in [[West Allis, Wisconsin]], later moving to Washington, Michigan, California, and Arizona. He was the seventh of eight children, and his father was an industrial engineer. As a child, Davis owned an [[Apple II]] and subsequently learned [[assembly language]] on a [[Commodore 64]]. He earned a masters degree in [[electric engineering]] from [[Arizona State University]] and worked for several years at [[TicketMaster]]&lt;ref name="VICE"&gt;{{Cite web| title = God's Lonely Programmer| last = Hicks |first = Jesse| work = [[Vice (magazine)|VICE Motherboard]]| date = {{date|2014-11-25|mdy}}| accessdate = 2015-04-21| url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/gods-lonely-programmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a programmer for [[VAX]] machines.&lt;ref name="tech_Temp"&gt;{{Cite web| title = TempleOS: an educational tool for programming experiments| first = James |last = Sanders| work = [[TechRepublic]]| date = {{date|2014-01-21|mdy}}| accessdate = 2015-04-21| url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/software-engineer/templeos-an-educational-tool-for-programming-experiments/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TempleOS==
{{main|TempleOS}}
Davis worked on TempleOS for 12 years.&lt;ref name="newsstack" /&gt; Its development began circa 2003,&lt;ref name="VICE"/&gt; after he suffered from delusions of space aliens and government agents that left him briefly hospitalized for his mental health issues.&lt;ref name="VICE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="slat_Temp"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Temple OS, un système d'exploitation pour parler à Dieu codé par un fou génial| first = Quentin |last=Bruet-Ferréol| work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate.fr]]| date = {{date|2014-05-13|mdy}}| accessdate = 2015-04-21| url = http://www.slate.fr/story/86549/temple-os-systeme-exploitation-parler-dieu| language = fr }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis grew up [[Catholic]] and was an [[atheist]] before experiencing a self-described "revelation". He described the experience as seeming "a lot like mental illness ... I felt guilty for being such a technology-advocate atheist ... It would sound polite if you said I scared myself thinking about quantum computers."&lt;ref name="VICE"/&gt; Afterward, he proclaimed that he was in direct communication with God, that God told him the operating system he built was for [[Third Temple|God's third temple]], and that TempleOS is of "divine intellect" due to the inspired nature of the code. He initially called it the "J Operating system" and later renamed it to "LoseThos", a reference to a scene from ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986).&lt;ref name="VICE"/&gt; Another name he used was "SparrowOS" before settling on "TempleOS".&lt;ref name="tech_Temp"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Terry Davis 1990 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Terry A. Davis circa 1990]]
Davis was controversial for his regular use of racist and homophobic slurs,&lt;ref name="VICE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsstack" /&gt; sometimes rebuking his critics as "niggers".&lt;ref name="VICE" /&gt; However, the critical reception to TempleOS was mostly favorable, as tech journalist David Cassel wrote, "programming websites tried to find the necessary patience and understanding to accommodate Davis".&lt;ref name="newsstack" /&gt; [[TechRepublic]] and [[OSNews]] published positive articles on Davis' work, even though Davis was banned from the latter for hostile comments targeting its readers and staff.&lt;ref name="newsstack" /&gt; He frequently communicated in randomly-generated blocks of text and off-topic declarations about God, which led to other bans from [[Something Awful]], [[Reddit]], and [[Hacker News]].&lt;ref name="VICE" /&gt;

Once TempleOS was released, most of Davis' time was spent "coding, web surfing, or using the output from the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] randomness beacon to talk to God".&lt;ref name="VICE"/&gt; He posted hours of video blogs to social media,&lt;ref name="dalles" /&gt; referring to himself as "the smartest programmer that's ever lived",&lt;ref name="newsstack" /&gt; and attracted a small online following.&lt;ref name="dalles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newsstack" /&gt; One fan described him as a "programming legend", while another, a computer engineer, compared the development of TempleOS to a one-man-built skyscraper.&lt;ref name="dalles"/&gt; He was "always lucid" talking with fans if the subject was about computers.&lt;ref name="newsstack" /&gt; In 2017, the OS was shown as a part of an [[outsider art]] exhibition in [[Bourogne]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diagonaledelart.blogs.liberation.fr/2017/01/13/art-brut-20/|title=la Diagonale de l’art  - ART BRUT 2.0|last=Godin|first=Philippe|date=2017-01-13|website=[[Libération]]|language=fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
During his final years, Davis struggled with periods of homelessness and brief jailtime. He stopped taking medication because he believed it limited his creativity. Some fans helped him by bringing him supplies, but he refused their housing offers.&lt;ref name="newsstack"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenewstack.io/the-troubled-legacy-of-terry-davis-gods-lonely-programmer/|title=The Troubled Legacy of Terry Davis, 'God's Lonely Programmer'|website=The New Stack|date=September 23, 2018|last=Cassel|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of August 11, 2018, while walking alongside railroad tracks in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], he was struck from the back and killed by a [[Union Pacific]] train. Investigators could not determine if his death was suicide or accidental.&lt;ref name="dalles"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedalleschronicle.com/news/2018/sep/07/man-killed-train-had-tech-following/|work=The Dalles Chronicle|last=Cecil|first=Neita|date=September 7, 2018|title=Man killed by train had tech following}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final video, recorded and uploaded hours before his death, he explained that he had recently removed most of his videos because he did not wish to "litter" the Internet. As reports of his death surfaced online, he was memorialized by fans in a number of tributes posted to social media.&lt;ref name="newsstack"/&gt;

'''The Amazing Acro-cats''' is a [[circus]] troupe of domestic [[cat]]s and a few other small animals, founded by animal trainer Samantha Martin. One of the featured performers is the musical band, the '''Rock-Cats'''. The troupe is based in [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name="Meet the Acro-Cats"/&gt; and tours the [[United States]] for nine months of the year.&lt;ref name="King 5"/&gt;

==History==
Founder Samantha Martin created the show in approximately 2005&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; as a way "''to keep her show cats mentally sharp in between television, film, and advertising jobs.''"&lt;ref name="Seattle Stranger"/&gt; In 2009, the troupe began to tour the U.S.&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; from its base in Chicago. In 2013, the troupe held its first show in Canada, in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref name="Canadian debut"/&gt;

In 2012, Martin started a [[Kickstarter]] fundraiser to replace the aging RV that had been used as the tour bus.&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; A goal of the campaign was to upgrade the facility, providing "a lush, plush, safe, and stimulating environment for the cats; everything from built-in perches, posts, catwalks, and toys; and even a nursery for our foster kittens."&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; Over $30,500 was raised from 567 contributors, which exceeded the campaign goal by over $2,500.&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; A new bus was in place by February 2013.&lt;ref name="Aspiring animal trainer"/&gt;

==Use of clicker training==

Martin uses [[clicker training]] to teach domestic cats and other animals to perform tricks.&lt;ref name="Brown Paper Tickets"/&gt; A treat is given at the sound of a click at the exact moment the cats are doing a desired behavior.&lt;ref name="Reporter-Herald"/&gt; ''It's just more of a fine tuning way of training,'' Martin said. ''It's noise and treats. It triggers something in their brain, and they get it very quickly.''&lt;ref name="Reporter-Herald"/&gt;

Martin uses varieties of tuna and chicken to reward the cats.&lt;ref name="King 5"/&gt; The results are not as consistent as might be achieved with more compliant animals such as dogs,&lt;ref name="Meow-y Christmas Review"/&gt; but the "long-standing notion that cats are un-trainable is thrown completely out the window."&lt;ref name="AXS"/&gt; During the one-hour show, the cats perform tricks such as "''walking tightropes, pushing carts, skateboarding, jumping through hoops, ringing bells, balancing on balls and turning on lights.''"&lt;ref name="Brown Paper Tickets"/&gt; When the cats don't perform as planned, it adds an element of humour, an important part of the show.&lt;ref name="Rochester Review"/&gt;

==Promotion of cat welfare==
Martin aims to improve the public perception of cats and to promote their welfare during her show. "We use our show as an entertaining demonstration of what cats are really capable of, as well as the healthy benefits of clicker training."&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; Martin demonstrates the [[clicker training]] technique in the show, training a kitten or cat to learn some new tricks.&lt;ref name="Rochester Review"/&gt; She explains that training can build richer relationships between cats and their humans;&lt;ref name="Brown Paper Tickets"/&gt; can be life-saving in emergencies when cats are trained to go to their carrier at the sound of a whistle;&lt;ref name="Rochester Review"/&gt; and can prevent behavioral problems, while providing physical exercise and mental stimulation.&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; "'We hope people are inspired to train their own cats,' Martin said. 'They enjoy the training. They want you to work with them.'"&lt;ref name="Reporter-Herald"/&gt; Clicker training kits are made available for purchase at shows and online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shop.bewitchedcattoys.com/Acro-Cats-Merchandise_c9.htm "Acro-Cats Merchandise"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901014358/http://shop.bewitchedcattoys.com/Acro-Cats-Merchandise_c9.htm |date=2014-09-01 }}, Bewitched Cat Toys, accessed July 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cats in the troupe are mainly former orphans, rescues and strays.&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; Since about 2008, Martin has also fostered many homeless cats and kittens.&lt;ref name="kickstarter"/&gt; She brings her fosters on tour, training them and featuring them in the show. Over the years, over 140 foster cats or kittens have been adopted to new homes as a result of these efforts.&lt;ref name="Reporter-Herald"/&gt; A portion of show proceeds is typically given to cat rescue organizations,&lt;ref name="Brown Paper Tickets"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AXS"/&gt; and on occasion the show itself is a benefit to promote a rescue organization.&lt;ref name="Reporter-Herald"/&gt;

==The Rock-Cats==
Each show closes with a performance by the Rock-Cats, billed as the "''only cat band in existence''".&lt;ref name="Seattle Stranger"/&gt; A review of a [[Seattle]] show in 2014 said "these cats are capable of anarchic musical compositions" that Martin likens to [[free jazz]]; "''an unpredictable assortment of instrument clanging, and rarely does it sound like the cats are playing the same song, let alone an actual, fully realized piece of music.''"&lt;ref name="Seattle Stranger"/&gt; Nevertheless, the reviewer found that "''white-haired diva''" band leader Tuna "''has the perfect demeanor for a rock star of any species.''"&lt;ref name="Seattle Stranger"/&gt; Another reviewer of the Seattle show said it was a "really, really fun way to spend an afternoon", and listened politely to the band while realizing that Oz was a better guitar player than she was.&lt;ref name="Back Beat Seattle review"/&gt;

A reviewer of a 2013 show in [[New Orleans]] was critical of the band's musicality, and complained that the advertised "seasonal carol selections such as 'A Cat in a Manger' and 'Catnip Roasting on an Open Fire'" never materialized."&lt;ref name="Meow-y Christmas Review"/&gt; A review of a [[Los Angeles]] show in 2012 stated that although the band was unlikely to win any [[Grammy Award]]s anytime soon, "''what they lacked in technical skill, they certainly made up for in rock 'n' roll catitude''".&lt;ref name="Meow Remix"/&gt;

'''Thomas Glenn Jolley''' (January 26, 1944 – March 20, 2014) was an [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War protester]] who [[renunciation of United States citizenship|renounced his U.S. citizenship]] in Canada. His move made him one of a small number of [[list of former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality|former Americans]] who voluntarily made themselves [[statelessness|stateless]] as a form of political protest. Soon after his renunciation, Jolley crossed back into the U.S. and began working in Florida. A U.S. federal court ruled that he was deportable, but the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] could not actually deport him to Canada because he had lost his [[Permanent residency in Canada|Canadian landed immigrant status]]. He died in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] at the age of 70.

==Early life and renunciation==
Jolley was born in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. He grew up in [[Bremen, Georgia]], and went on to attend the [[University of Georgia]] before transferring to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]; he initially hoped to study to become an architect, but later changed his course of study to journalism.&lt;ref name="SHT19711206"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19711206&amp;id=WSMhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e2YEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7453,2572296|title=Hopes To Stay In U.S.; Tom Jolley: Man Without A Country|work=Sarasota Herald Tribune|date=1971-12-06|accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He registered for the [[Selective Service System]] and was given a II-S student deferment.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=46+Tul.+L.+Rev.+984&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=5c58d4f5627ff219c0f8c0e7a04458bf|first=Milton C.|last=Lorenz|title=Aliens: Renunciation of Nationality Leaves Individual Stateless and Excludable as Any Alien|work=Tulane Law Review|date=June 1972|volume=46|issue=984|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Margaret Elizabeth Thompson of [[Atlanta]] on November 6, 1966.&lt;ref name="LodiSentinel19690414"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NBw_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Qk8MAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6994,1102309|title=Draft Dodger Seeks Hearing To Appeal U.S. Deportation Order|work=Lodi News-Sentinel|date=1969-04-14|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January or February 1967, he withdrew from university. He attempted to obtain I-O [[conscientious objector]] status, but was denied, and was instead classified I-A (available for induction).&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt; After twice being ordered to report for induction, he was arrested by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] in February 1967 and charged with violating the Selective Service Act.&lt;ref name="RomeNewsTribune19690423"/&gt; He then crossed the border into Canada with his American wife, obtained [[landed immigrant]] status there (though not [[Canadian nationality law|Canadian citizenship]]), and in May went to the United States Consulate in [[Toronto]] and renounced his citizenship.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OttawaCitizen19711109"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=07oyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wOwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4374,3157935|title=Move to escape draft may cost him a home|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=1971-11-09|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His oath of renunciation was signed before U.S. Consul Richard J. Dols.&lt;ref name="RomeNewsTribune19690423"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=348&amp;dat=19690423&amp;id=pFlMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rjEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7308,6855420|title=Deportation order considered|work=Rome News Tribune|date=1969-04-23|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deportation case==
Jolley later returned to the United States, apparently via [[Detroit]].&lt;ref name="LodiSentinel19690414"/&gt; He then went south and began working as a news reporter for the ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'' in [[Tallahassee, Florida]], while his wife enrolled in graduate school at [[Florida State University]].&lt;ref name="SHT19711206"/&gt; After the news of his situation went public, ''Democrat'' managing editor William Phillips, who made the decision to hire Jolley, commented that the paper had received equal numbers of letters of support and [[hate mail]] for its decision not to fire Jolley.&lt;ref name="PPG19711110"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K9JaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uGwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7591,1501685|title=He's Being Deported, But Where?|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=1971-11-10|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=w-gbAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wlEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7277,804875|title=Man Without A Country — Canada Next?|work=The Dispatch|date=1971-11-10|accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government ordered Jolley deported, but he did not depart the country voluntarily, and so on February 22, 1968, he was again arrested by FBI agents. He was released on a $3,000 bond pending formal deportation proceedings against him.&lt;ref name="LodiSentinel19690414"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/daily-review/1968-11-29/page-15|title=Faces Deportation: War Protester Claims Stand Cost Him 2 Jobs|work=The Daily Review|date=1968-11-29|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. media described him as a "[[draft evasion|draft evader]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=15084|first=Harry|last=Reasoner|first2=David|last2=Snell|title=Draft Evader Case|work=ABC Evening News|date=1971-04-15|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19700414&amp;id=oh8rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CqAFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6149,2097112|first=Andrew|last=Tully|title=Draft Evader Insults Memory of U.S. Hero|work=Reading Eagle|date=1970-04-14|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others called him a "modern-day Philip Nolan", a reference to the main character of the [[American Civil War]] short story ''[[The Man Without a Country]]''.&lt;ref name="SHT19740210"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19740210&amp;id=XT0gAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1WYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7094,4213038|first=Joan|last=Zyda|title=More Americans Shed Citizenship|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=1974-02-10|accessdate=2013-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Represented by attorney [[Peter Rindskopf]], Jolley appealed his case to the [[Board of Immigration Appeals]] in April 1969, but the Board ruled against him in March 1970.&lt;ref name="RomeNewsTribune19690423"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A18168808"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/intdec/vol13/2039.pdf|title=Matter of Jolley In Deportation Proceedings A-18168808|publisher=United States Department of Justice|date=1970-03-19|accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed again to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], which in April 1971 also ruled against him.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/441/1245/209932/|title=441 F.2d 1245: Thomas Glenn Jolley, Petitioner, v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, Respondent|publisher=Justia.com|date=1971-04-12|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court struck down his argument that his renunciation was involuntary because he was being forced into military service, instead ruling that it indeed constituted voluntary relinquishment within the meaning of ''[[Afroyim v.

==Aftermath==
Jolley was thus declared deportable, but before he could be deported, another country would have to be found to accept him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19711109&amp;id=s_FOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2gEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7176,3753839|title=High Court Backs Ouster of Native Who Quit U.S.|work=Toledo Blade|date=1971-11-09|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the [[Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada]] stated that Jolley may have lost his landed immigrant status due to his long absence from Canada, but he could apply for immigration permission again at a Canadian port of entry.&lt;ref name="OttawaCitizen19711109"/&gt; Jolley was given 90 days to voluntarily depart the country, failing which the government would commence [[removal proceedings]] on February 7, 1972, but in January that year, Representatives [[Phillip Burton]] and [[Ron Dellums]] (both D-CA) sponsored separate [[List of beneficiaries of immigration/nationality-related United States Private Bills/Laws|private bills to grant a green card to Jolley]], and the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] asked the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] to provide a full report about Jolley. The removal process was suspended while the bill was under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1964&amp;dat=19711110&amp;id=139GAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KCsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3002,4431775|title=Thomas Jolley, Man Without A Country: Jolley May Lose Fight To Remain|work=The Palm Beach Post|date=1971-11-10|accessdate=2014-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6d8bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sFEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7146%2C2124236|first=Barbara|last=Frye|title=Renounced Citizenship: Two Congressmen Say Let Jolley Remain In U.S.|work=The Lexington Dispatch|date=1972-02-01|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Dellums sponsored another [[private bill]] to the same effect, but no further action was taken on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d093:H.R.3188:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status: 93rd Congress (1973–1974), H.R. 3188|publisher=thomas.loc.gov|date=1973-01-29|accessdate=2012-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 1974, Jolley still had not been deported and was living in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]]. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that "Canada, which has no legal obligation to take Jolley back, does not want him back", and quoted an [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] spokesman as stating that the government had "no choice but to let him live here". With no country to which he could be deported, it was expected that he might spend the rest of his life living in the United States as a deportable alien.&lt;ref name="SHT19740210"/&gt;

He died in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] at the age of 70 on March 20, 2014 from undisclosed causes.&lt;ref name="AJC20140320"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/atlanta/obituary.aspx?pid=170289438|title=Obituary: Thomas Glenn Jolley|work=Atlanta Constitution-Journal|date=2014-03-20|accessdate=2014-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Richard Paxton''' (born October 31, 1937) is an [[United States|American]] [[folk music|folk]] [[singer-songwriter]] who has had a music career spanning more than fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tom-paxton-mn0000934721/biography|title=All Music Bio|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Paxton received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].&lt;ref name="TPaxGrammyClip"&gt;{{YouTube|Ivh6Y0NrIWA|Tom Paxton Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award Announcement (brief video clip from the 51st Annual Grammy Awards telecast)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPostFeb2009"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/06/AR2009020603708.html?referrer=emailarticle Power Of Just Plain Folk, Tom Paxton Humbly Garners Life Grammy], J. Freedom du Lac, ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', February 7, 2009, p. C01&lt;/ref&gt; He is noteworthy as a music educator as well as an advocate for folk singers to combine traditional songs with new compositions.

Paxton's songs have been widely covered, including modern standards such as "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]", "[[Bottle of Wine]]", "Whose Garden Was This", "The Marvelous Toy", and "Ramblin' Boy".  Paxton's songs have been recorded by [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[The Weavers]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Sandy Denny]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[The Seekers]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[The Kingston Trio]], the [[Chad Mitchell Trio]], [[John Denver]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Porter Wagoner]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Flatt &amp; Scruggs]], [[The Move]], [[The Fireballs]], and many others ([[List of works by Tom Paxton#Covers|see covers]]).  He has performed thousands of concerts around the world.{{citation needed|date=May 2016|reason=Source required for information clarification}}

==Early life==
Paxton was born on October 31, 1937, in [[Chicago, Illinois]], to Burt and Esther Paxton. His father was "a chemist, mostly self-educated",&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and as his health began to fail him, the family moved to [[Wickenburg, Arizona]].  It was here that young Paxton began riding horses at the numerous [[Guest ranch|dude ranches]] in the area.  It was also here that he was first introduced to folk music, discovering the music of [[Burl Ives]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, the family moved to [[Bristow, Oklahoma]], which Paxton considers to be his hometown.  Soon after, his father died from a stroke.  Paxton was about fifteen when he received his first stringed instrument, a ukulele.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was given a guitar by his aunt when he was sixteen, and he soon began to immerse himself in the music of Burl Ives and [[Harry Belafonte]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Paxton enrolled at the [[University of Oklahoma]], where he studied in the drama school.  It was here that he first found other enthusiasts of folk music and discovered the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[The Weavers]].  Paxton would later note, "Woody was fearless; he'd take on any issue that got him stirred up&amp;nbsp;... and he became one of my greatest influences."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In college, he was in a group known as the Travellers, and they sang in an off-campus coffeehouse.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Upon graduating in 1959 with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree, Paxton acted in [[summer stock theatre]] and briefly tried graduate school before joining the [[United States Army|Army]].  While attending the Clerk Typist School in [[Fort Dix]], [[New Jersey]], he began writing songs on his typewriter and spent almost every weekend visiting [[Greenwich Village]] in [[New York City]] during the emerging early 1960s [[American folk music revival|folk revival]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his [[honorable discharge]] from the Army, Paxton auditioned for the Chad Mitchell Trio via publisher [[Milt Okun]] in 1960.  He initially received the part, but his voice did not blend well enough with those of the group members. However, after singing his song "The Marvelous Toy" for Okun, he became the first writer signed to Milt's music publishing company, Cherry Lane Music Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton soon began performing at [[The Gaslight Cafe]] in Greenwich Village, where he became a mainstay.  In 1962, he recorded a privately produced live album at the Gaslight entitled, ''I'm the Man That Built the Bridges''.  During his stay in Greenwich Village, Paxton published some of his songs in the folk magazines ''[[Broadside Magazine|Broadside]]'' and ''[[Sing Out!]]'', and performed alongside such folksingers as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Eric Andersen]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], and [[Mississippi John Hurt]].  Paxton met his future wife, Margaret Ann Cummings (known as "Midge"), at the Gaslight one night in January 1963 after being introduced to her by [[David Blue (musician)|David Blue]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pete Seeger]] picked up on a few of Tom Paxton's songs in 1963, including "Ramblin' Boy" (which Seeger performed at [[The Weavers]] reunion concert at [[Carnegie Hall]]) and "What Did You Learn in School Today?" Paxton increased his profile as a performer, appearing at the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]], which was recorded by [[Vanguard Records]]. A month after Newport in 1963, Paxton married Midge.  He began traveling the country on the coffeehouse and small-venue circuit before returning to New York.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) pp. 26-29&lt;/ref&gt;  Paxton became involved with causes that promoted [[human rights]], [[civil rights]] and [[labor rights]]. In 1963, Paxton and a group of other folk musicians performed and offered [[moral support]] to [[Strike action|striking]] [[Coal mining|coal miners]] in [[Hazard, Kentucky]]. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

After returning to New York, Paxton signed with [[Elektra Records]] in 1964, a label which at that time featured a distinguished roster of folk musicians.  He would go on to record seven albums for Elektra.  As the folk revival hit its peak, Paxton began getting more work outside of New York City, including benefit concerts and college campus visits.  In 1964, he took part in the [[Freedom Summer]] and visited the [[Deep South]], with other folk musicians, to perform at [[voter registration drive]]s and civil rights [[Demonstration (people)|rallies]].  His civil rights song "Beau John" was written after attending a Freedom Song Workshop in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], and the song "Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney" was written about the murders of three civil rights [[Activism|activists]] ([[Andrew Goodman]], [[Michael Schwerner]] and [[James Chaney]]) in the summer of 1964 by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] near [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]]. Paxton's own compositions began to be increasingly recognized within folk music circles, and in other genres.

Of the songwriters on the Greenwich Village scene of the 1960s, [[Dave Van Ronk]] said, "Dylan is usually cited as the founder of the new song movement, and he certainly became its most visible standard-bearer, but the person who started the whole thing was Tom Paxton&amp;nbsp;... he tested his songs in the crucible of live performance, he found that his own stuff was getting more attention than when he was singing traditional songs or stuff by other people ... he set himself a training regimen of deliberately writing one song every day.  Dylan had not yet showed up when this was happening, and by the time Bobby came on the set, with at most two or three songs he had written, Tom was already singing at least 50 percent his own material.  That said, it was Bobby's success that really got the ball rolling.  Prior to that, the folk community was very much tied to traditional songs, so much so that songwriters would sometimes palm their own stuff off as traditional."&lt;ref&gt;Dave Van Ronk, ''The Mayor of MacDougal Street'' (2006) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Paxton made his first tour of the [[United Kingdom]]. The tour was the beginning of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met [[Bruce Woodley]], one of the founding members of the Australian folk group [[The Seekers]] and they collaborated on the song "Angeline (Is Always Friday)" which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group [[Clear Light]] recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton's song "Mr. Blue" on their only album ''[[Clear Light (album)|Clear Light]]''.  [[Porter Wagoner]] and [[Dolly Parton]]'s recording of "[[The Last Thing on My Mind]]" reached the top ten on the U.S. country singles charts in December 1967.  Then in 1968, Paxton scored a Top 10 radio hit when [[The Fireballs]] recorded his song "[[Bottle of Wine]]".  In the 1960s, Paxton licensed one of his songs, "My Dog's Bigger than Your Dog", for use in a [[Ken-L Ration]] dog food commercial.  Not too fazed by the success of some of his songs, Paxton continued writing and performing. He was not interested in jumping on the [[folk rock]] (or, as he once joked, "folk rot"&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, "Folk Rot", ''[[Sing Out!]]'' (Autumn 1965)&lt;/ref&gt;) bandwagon though, and continued his folk singer-songwriter style on albums like ''Outward Bound'' (1966) and ''Morning Again'' (1968).  On January 20, 1968, three months after the death of Woody Guthrie, Paxton and a number of other prominent folk musicians performed at the [[Harold Leventhal]] produced "A Tribute to Woody Guthrie" concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/events/harold.htm|title=Harold Leventhal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton decided to try some more elaborate recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, as well as his acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate [[Judy Collins]] and his friend [[Phil Ochs]] were experimenting with around this time.  Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with ''The Things I Notice Now'' in the summer of 1969, and also charted with ''Tom Paxton 6'' in the spring of the following year.  His song "Whose Garden Was This", an [[Environmentalism|environmentalist]] anthem written for the first [[Earth Day]], was later recorded by [[John Denver]] and became the title track of [[Whose Garden Was This|Denver's 1970 album]].  The diverse "Baroque Folk" experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best.  Regarding this time, he said, "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most&amp;nbsp;... I ''know'' I didn't have that rock mentality or anything.  I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma.  And I just wanted to hear folk songs."&lt;ref name="RUnterberger"&gt;Richie Unterberger Interview (2000) http://www.richieunterberger.com/paxton.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.

===Middle career===
Paxton, his wife and their two daughters lived in [[Holland Park|Holland Park, London]], for about four years in the early 1970s.  After a stay in England due to professional success and love of the country, Paxton and Midge went on a tour of [[New Zealand]] and [[China]] and even appeared on a Chinese talk show.  Paxton released ''How Come the Sun'' in 1971. The album gave him his highest chart ranking in the U.S. but it only reached number 120 and his next album, ''Peace Will Come'' (1972), barely even reached the charts.  He soon returned to [[New York City]] and the [[Long Island]] town of [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]] before moving to the [[Washington, D.C.]] area around 1977.  After recording three albums for [[Reprise Records]] and a few for "an English label that didn't pan out well",&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Paxton signed with [[Vanguard Records]], with whom he recorded a live album with [[Steve Goodman]], ''New Songs From the Briarpatch'' (1977), which contained some of Paxton's [[topical song]]s of the 1970s, including "Talking Watergate" and "White Bones of Allende" as well as a song dedicated to [[Mississippi John Hurt]] entitled "Did You Hear John Hurt?" In 1978, Paxton released his album ''Heroes'', which contained a song, "Phil", about his friend [[Phil Ochs]], who had taken his own life in 1976.  The album also includes the song "The Death of Stephen Biko", which details the brutal killing of anti-[[History of South Africa in the Apartheid era|apartheid]] activist [[Stephen Biko]] in [[South Africa]]. 
Paxton's 1979 album, ''Up and Up'', contains the song "Let the Sunshine", which addresses issues concerning [[environmentalism]] and [[solar energy]].  Paxton has also performed at the [[Clearwater Festival]], an annual event, started by [[Pete Seeger]], dedicated to environmentalism and cleaning up the [[Hudson River]].  His 1983 album ''Bulletin'' includes a song about [[Woody Guthrie]] entitled "They Couldn't Take the Music."&lt;ref&gt;[[ArtistDirect]], [http://artistdirect.com/nad/store/artist/album/0,,144530,00.html Tom Paxton: ''Bulletin''.] Retrieved November 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After recording for labels such as Mountain Railroad and Flying Fish in the 1980s, Paxton started his own label, Pax Records, in 1987. It was during this time that Paxton continued to suffer from an undiagnosed and deepening depression that affected his work.  With some advice from Midge, he began to look for a solution and was eventually diagnosed with [[Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|Attention Deficit Disorder]], for which he received ongoing treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000) p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent career===
As the 1990s rolled around, Paxton began delving deeply into [[children's music]], recording nine children's albums during the decade.  In July 1994, Paxton was invited to perform at a folk festival in [[Israel]], "Jacob's Ladder", and he played there and a series of concerts around Israel accompanied by folk guitarist and harmonica player Shay Tochner.  Paxton recorded a live album in 1996 with his good friend Jim Rooney, and it contained some new comical songs about current events.  [[Eric Weissberg]], [[John Gorka]], [[Robin and Linda Williams]], among others, also performed; and the album was titled ''Live: For the Record''.  In the mid-1990s, Paxton also began to give more workshops in songwriting. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2000, Paxton once again began to write more of the [[topical song]]s that had been prominent during his early career.  In 2001, he released an album with Anne Hills entitled ''Under American Skies'', and in 2002, he released an album of all new songs entitled ''Looking for the Moon'' (Appleseed Recordings).  At the time of its release, Paxton was quoted saying that it might be his best album so far.&lt;ref&gt;Behind the Beat audio interview (2002) {{cite web |url=http://www.behindthebeat.net/artist.asp?sid=1&amp;ar=320&amp;al=315 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609050609/http://www.behindthebeat.net/artist.asp?sid=1&amp;ar=320&amp;al=315 |archivedate=2007-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Looking for the Moon'' contains the song "The Bravest", which is about the firefighters who gave their lives while trying to save others in New York City on September 11, 2001. Around this time, Paxton began writing and releasing his "Short Shelf Life Songs" about current events for free download on his website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tompaxton.com/download.html Short Shelf Life Songs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703054937/http://tompaxton.com/download.html |date=2007-07-03 }}; accessed June 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Paxton wrote a number of [[Topical song|topical]] [[protest song]]s that were critical of the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration's]] actions. In 2007, he rewrote a song of his from 1965 entitled "Lyndon Johnson Told The Nation", about the [[Vietnam War#Escalation and ground war|escalation of the war in Vietnam]], and transformed it into "George W. Told The Nation", about the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge in the Iraq war]]. In 2007, Tom Paxton  became one of the founding members of the [[Copyright Alliance]], whose purpose is to promote the cultural and economic benefits of copyrights. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2008, Paxton rewrote his song "I'm Changing My Name to Chrysler", about the federal [[History of Chrysler#1980s and the Government loan guarantees|loan guarantee to Chrysler in 1979]], as "I Am Changing My Name to Fannie Mae", about the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|700 billion dollar "bailout of the U.S. financial system"]]. He continues to perform yearly tours of the United States and UK. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In March 2015, Paxton released the studio album ''[[Redemption Road (album)|Redemption Road]]''.&lt;ref name="Kickstarter Tom Paxton Redemption Road"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1971199080/tom-paxtons-new-recording-redemption-road |title=Tom Paxton's New Recording-Redemption Road |date= 28 September 2014 |website=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate= 22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Paxton released ''Boat In The Water'', his sixty-third album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Tom Paxton Album "Boat In The Water" Out NOW|url=http://www.tompaxton.com/new-tom-paxton-album-boat-in-the-water-out-january-27-2017/|website=tompaxton.com|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton is now in "semi-retirement," though he still performs occasional shows and did a 10 venue UK tour in 2017.

==Personal life and family==
Paxton married his wife, Midge, in 1963. They have two daughters, Jennifer and Kate, and three grandsons. Jennifer is a history professor who has published courses for [[The Teaching Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tompaxton.com/jennifer-paxton-and-the-teaching-company/ |title=Jennifer Paxton and The Teaching Company |publisher=Tom Paxton website |author=Tom Paxton |date=March 8, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has described his [[Politics|political]] [[Ideology|views]] in the following way:  "My own politics more or less resembled [[Will Rogers]]'s politics. He had said that he belonged to no organized political party&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; he was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]&amp;nbsp;... being young and impassioned almost automatically put me over on the radical side of most issues. Being older, I find myself still more or less there, somewhat to my surprise."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Paxton, ''The Honor of Your Company'' (2000),  p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Midge Paxton died in 2014 after a long illness.

==Awards, honors, and nominations==

'''Ukrainian names''' are given names that originated in [[Ukraine]]. In addition to the first (given) names, [[Ukrainians]] also have  [[patronymic]] and [[Ukrainian surnames|family names]].

== Ukrainian given names ==
[[Diminutive]] and [[hypocoristic]] forms native to [[Ukrainian language]] have either empty [[inflexion]]al [[Suffix]] ({{lang|uk|Гринь}}, {{lang|uk|Сень}}) or affixes -o, -e, -ik ({{lang|uk|Славко}}, {{lang|uk|Грицько}}, {{lang|uk|Славця}}, {{lang|uk|Грицуня}}, {{lang|uk|Андрійчик}}, {{lang|uk|Петрик}}).

As with most cultures, a person has a [[given name]] chosen by the parents. First names in East-[[Slavic languages]] mostly originate from two sources: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] church tradition (which is itself of [[Greek language|Greek]] origin), [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Catholic]] church tradition (which is itself of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin) and [[Slavic names|native pre-Christian Slavic origin lexicons]]. Most names have several diminutive forms.

'''Wallace D. Fard''', also known as '''Wallace Fard Muhammad''' (Arabic: ولس فرض محمد) ({{IPAc-en|f|ə|ˈ|r|ɑː|d}}; born February 26, 1877{{#tag:ref|The years 1891 and 1893 have both been cited by sources relying upon FBI records primarily. The FBI file on Fard provides both dates, and states: "Our investigation of the NOI and Ford failed to establish his birth date and birth place." Fard reportedly claimed to have been born in 1877.&lt;ref name="FBI File SAC 25-330971-26"&gt;FBI File SAC (25-330971-26)&lt;/ref&gt;}} – circa 1934), was a co-founder of the [[Nation of Islam]]. He arrived in [[Detroit]] in 1930 with an obscure background and several aliases, and taught an idiosyncratic form of [[Islam]] to members of the city's [[African Americans|black]] population. He was also known as being a seller of silk, incense, and perfume and was described as an Arab or Middle Eastern man, but remembered as being a "light-skinned" black man by leaders of the Nation of Islam. Fard was last seen in 1933 by [[Elijah Muhammad]], when Fard took off in an airplane from the Detroit airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smothers|first1=David|title=The Facts Belie the Aura of Menace|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1974/07/21/page/45/article/the-facts-belie-the-aura-of-menace|website=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=March 12, 2017|date=July 21, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beynon's account of Fard and his followers==
In 1938, an article by sociologist Erdmann Doane Beynon was published in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'', giving Beynon's first-hand account of several interviews that he conducted with followers of Fard in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|pp=893–907}}&lt;/ref&gt; From those interviews, Beynon wrote that Fard lived and taught in Detroit from 1930 to 1934.&lt;ref name="Beynon_896"/&gt; He came to the homes of black families who had recently migrated to Detroit from the rural south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|pp=894–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began by selling silks door to door, telling his listeners that the silks came from their home country. At his suggestion, he came back to teach the residents, along with guests.&lt;ref name="Beynon_895"&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early stage of his ministry, Fard "used the [[Bible]] as his textbook, since it was the only religious book with which the majority of his hearers were familiar. With growing prestige over a constantly increasing group, [Fard] became bolder in his denunciation of the [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and began to attack the teachings of the Bible in such a way as to shock his hearers and bring them to an emotional crisis."&lt;ref name="Beynon_895"/&gt;

Those interviewed by Beynon told him that reports of Fard's message spread throughout the black community. Attendance at the house meetings grew until the listeners were divided into groups and taught in shifts. Finally, the community contributed money and rented a hall to serve as a Temple where meetings were conducted.&lt;ref name="Beynon_896"&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quran]] was soon introduced as the most authoritative of all texts for the study of the faith according to those interviewed by Beynon.&lt;ref name="Beynon_900"&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fard prepared texts himself, which served as authoritative manuals of the faith and were memorized verbatim by those who followed him.&lt;ref name="Beynon_900"/&gt;

From his interviews, Beynon described disputes and tension that arose between the new community and the police, surrounding the groups' refusal to send their children to public schools, and members of the group who some alleged to have participated in "human sacrifice" in 1932 in an effort to obey lessons given to the community regarding the sacrifice of devils.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|pp=903–04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Beynon stated that Fard's position on human sacrifice "was never made clear."&lt;/ref&gt; These incidents drew police attention to the group, according to Beynon, and contributed to persecutions and schisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fard named his community the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref name="Beynon_897"&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rapid increase in membership, Fard instituted a formal organizational structure.&lt;ref name="Beynon_902"&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=902}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the University of Islam, where school age children were taught, rather than in the public schools.&lt;ref name="Beynon_902"/&gt; He established the Moslem Girls' Training and General Civilization Class, where women were taught how to keep their houses, clean, and cook. The men of the organization were drilled by captains and referred to as the Fruit of Islam. The entire movement was placed under a Minister of Islam.&lt;ref name="Beynon_902"/&gt;

According to Beynon, Fard's followers grew to approximately eight thousand.&lt;ref name="Beynon_897"/&gt; "Within three years the prophet not only began the movement but organized it so well that he himself was able to recede into the background, appearing almost never to his followers during the final months of his residence in Detroit."&lt;ref name="Beynon_902"/&gt;

From interviews with approximately two hundred families who followed Fard, Beynon concluded:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the prophet lived in Detroit from July 4, 1930 until June 30, 1934, virtually nothing is known about him, save that he "came from the East" and that he "called" the Negroes of North America to enter the Nation of Islam. His very name is uncertain. He was known usually as Mr. Wali Farrad or Mr. W. D. Fard, though he used also the following names: Professor Ford, Mr. Farrad Mohammed, Mr. F. Mohammed Ali. One of the few survivors who heard his first addresses states that he himself said: "My name is W.D. Fard and I came from the Holy City of Mecca. More about myself I will not tell you yet, for the time has not yet come. I am your brother. You have not yet seen me in my royal robes." Legends soon sprang up about this mysterious personality ...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fard used the name W. F. Muhammad on several lessons written in 1933 and 1934.&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt; In 1933, he began signing his name W. F. Muhammad, which stands for Wallace Fard Muhammad.&lt;ref name="harvp|Muhammad|1965|pp=16–17"&gt;{{harvp|Muhammad|1965|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to trace Fard’s history==
A declassified [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) memorandum dated May 16, 1957 states: "From a review of instant file it does not appear that there has been a concerted effort to locate and fully identify W. D. Fard. Inasmuch as Elijah Muhammad recognizes W.D. Fard as being Allah (God) and claims that Fard is the source of all of his teachings, it is suggested that an exhaustive effort be made to fully identify and locate W. D. Fard and/or members of his family."&lt;ref&gt;FBI File SAC (25-20607) at 476&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI took note of the article written by Erdmann Doane Beynon, and it conducted a search for Fard using various aliases including the name "Ford".&lt;ref&gt;FBI File SAC (100-26356) at 451-473, SAC Chicago (100-33683)&lt;/ref&gt;

The search produced two Fords of interest, one of whom was [[Wallace Ford]], a prominent movie actor. The other was Wallie D. Ford of California, arrested by Los Angeles police on November 17, 1918, on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon; by the Los Angeles police January 20, 1926, for violation of the California Woolwine Possession Act;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/FBI-Wallace-Fard-Muhammad|title=FBI Documents on Wallace Fard Muhammad|last=U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Los Angeles police on February 15, 1926, for violation of the State Poison Act, for which he was sentenced to six months to six years at [[San Quentin State Prison]] on June 12, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;FBI File SAC (100-43165-16)&lt;/ref&gt; According to San Quentin records, Wallie D. Ford was born in [[Portland, Oregon]] on February 25, 1891, the white son of Zared and Beatrice Ford, who were both born in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;FBI report CG 100-3386, page 2. [http://vault.fbi.gov/Wallace%20Fard%20Muhammed/Wallace%20Fard%20Muhammed%20Part%202%20of%207/view "FBI report CG 100-3386"], ''FBI Records: The Vault''; retrieved October 14, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 1957, the FBI located and interviewed Hazel Barton-Ford, Wallie Ford's common-law wife, with whom he had a son named Wallace Dodd Ford, born September 1, 1920.&lt;ref name="SAC LA 105-4805"&gt;FBI File SAC LA (105-4805) at 135&lt;/ref&gt; Barton-Ford gave a description of Wallie Ford, and described him as a Caucasian New Zealander.&lt;ref name="SAC LA 105-4805"/&gt; The FBI's search for Fard was officially closed one year later on April 15, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;FBI File Director FBI (105-63642) at 248, SAC Chicago (100-33683)&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 1959, the FBI sent a story to the Chicago ''New Crusader'' newspaper, stating that Fard was a "Turkish-born Nazi agent who worked for Hitler in World War II."&lt;ref name="Evanzz_204_205"&gt;{{harvp|Evanzz|2001|pp=204–05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story from the FBI, Fard was a "Muslim from Turkey who had come to the United States in the early 1900s. He had met Muhammad in prison … where the two men plotted a confidence game in which followers were charged a fee to become Muslims."&lt;ref name="Evanzz_204_205"/&gt; After the story was published, Elijah Muhammad and [[Malcolm X]] subsequently charged Black media outlets, who re-printed the accusation in large numbers, with running the story without requesting a response from the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref name="Evanzz_204_205"/&gt;

A February 19, 1963, FBI memorandum states: "In connection with efforts to disrupt and curb growth of the NOI, extensive research has been conducted into various files maintained by this office. Among the files reviewed was that of Wallace Dodd Ford."&lt;ref&gt;FBI File Director, FBI (25-330971) at 258, SAC Chicago (100-35635)&lt;/ref&gt; Five months later, in July 1963, the FBI told the ''[[Los Angeles Herald-Examiner|Los Angeles Evening Herald-Examiner]]'' that Fard was actually Wallace Dodd Ford.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Evanzz|2001|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper published the story in an article titled: "Black Muslim Founder Exposed As White."&lt;ref&gt;"Black Muslim Founder Exposed As White", ''Los Angeles Evening Herald-Examiner'', July 28, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; An FBI memorandum dated the following month, August 1963, states that the FBI had not been able to verify his birth date or birthplace, and "he was last heard from in 1934."&lt;ref name="FBI File SAC 25-330971-26"/&gt;

===Chroniclers' history of Fard from FBI file===
Karl Evanzz of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' submitted a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request to the FBI in 1978 requesting its file on Fard.&lt;ref name="Evanzz_xvii"&gt;{{harvp|Evanzz|2001|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evanzz based his account of the life of Fard on the declassified portion of the FBI file that he received about a decade after his request. Evanzz detailed the experience of several other authors who based their accounts of the life of Fard on the FBI file as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Evanzz|2001|pp=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the FBI's response to the Freedom of Information Act request, Karl Evanzz claimed that Fard, using the name Fred Dodd, married Pearl Allen in [[Multnomah County, Oregon]], on May 9, 1914, with their first child, a son, born the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Evanzz|2001|p=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gibson|2012|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dodd left his family in 1916 and moved to Los Angeles, using the name Wallie Dodd Ford. A World War I draft registration card for Wallie Dodd Fard&lt;ref name=afghan&gt;[http://mxmission.blogspot.com/2011/04/four-faces-of-wali-d-fard-muhammad.html Nation of Islam's Founder Was Afghani; Suffered from Diabetes], mxmission.blogspot.com; retrieved January 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1917 indicated he was living in Los Angeles, unmarried, as a restaurant owner, and reported that he was born in [[Shinkay District|Shinka]], [[Afghanistan]] on February 26, 1893. He was described as being of medium height and build with brown eyes and black hair. On the draft card, "Ford" is written in parenthesis. No reason is given. At the bottom of the card, he signed his name as "Wallie Dodd Ford".&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com database, Registration Location: Los Angeles County, California; Roll: 1530899; Draft Board: 17&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1920, Ford was still living in Los Angeles, as 26-year-old Wallie D. Ford, with his 25-year-old wife, Hazel. In the [[1920 United States Census]] he reported his race as white, his occupation as a proprietor of a restaurant, and gave his place of birth as New Zealand. He provided no known place of birth for his parents, nor his date of immigration.&lt;ref&gt;1920 Federal U.S. Census, Los Angeles City, Enumeration District 206, Sheet 10B&lt;/ref&gt;

A marriage certificate dated June 5, 1924, was issued to Wallie Dodd Ford and Carmen Trevino in [[Orange County, California]]. Ford reported he was a cook, age 26, born in Oregon, but living in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;California State Board of Health, County of Orange, Certificate of Marriage, Local Registered No. 1768, as located in "California, County Marriages, 1850–1952", index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K8FM-5FP: accessed January 5, 2013), Wallie Dodd Ford and Carmen Frevino, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that Ford had roots in what is today [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''The Search for Neofascism: The Use and Abuse of Social Science'', [[Cambridge University Press]] (2006), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Zared Fard, an East Indian; either Zared or his parents immigrated to [[New Zealand]] from what is present-day Pakistan.&lt;ref name=evanzz&gt;{{cite book|author=Evanzz, Karl|title=The Messenger: the Rise and Fall of Elijah Muhammad|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1999|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fard Muhammad's mother Beatrice was a white Englishwoman living in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=evanzz/&gt;

===Moorish Science Temple of America===
In addition to claiming that Fard was Ford, Evanzz also claimed that Fard was once a member of the [[Moorish Science Temple of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Evanzz|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;  citing as a primary source the 1945 publication by Arna Bontemps and Jack Conroy titled ''They Seek A City''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bontemps|Conroy|1945}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors have also cited E.U. Essien-Udom for this proposition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Essien-Udom|1995|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1962 book titled ''Black Nationalism: The Search for an Identity'', E. U. Essien-Udom included the following passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Noble Drew Ali]] was shot and stabbed in his offices at the Unity Club in Chicago on the night of March 15, 1929 … He was eventually released on bond, but a few weeks later, he died under mysterious circumstances. Some people claim that he died from injuries inflicted by the police while he was in jail. Others, however, suggest that he was killed by [Sheik Claude] Greene's partisans. For some time, one W. D. Fard assumed leadership of the Moorish movement. According to Bontemps and Conroy, Fard claimed that he was the reincarnation of Noble Drew Ali. By 1930 a permanent split developed in the movement. One faction, the Moors, remains faithful to Noble Drew Ali, and the other, which is now led by Elijah Muhammad, remains faithful to Prophet Fard (Master Wallace Fard Muhammad). However, Minister Malcolm X and other leaders of the Nation of Islam have emphatically denied any past connection whatsoever of Elijah Muhammad, Master Wallace Fard Muhammad, or their movement with Nobel Drew Ali's Moorish American Science Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Essien-Udom|1995|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the question of a connection between the Nation of Islam and the Moorish Science Temple of America, Beynon wrote the following from his interviews with Fard's followers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Awakened already to a consciousness of race discrimination, these migrants from the South came into contact with militant movements among northern Negroes. Practically none of them had been in the North prior to the collapse of the [[Marcus Garvey]] movement. A few of them had come under the influence of the Moorish-American cult which succeeded it. The effect of both these movements upon the future members of the Nation of Islam was largely indirect. Garvey taught the Negroes that their homeland was Ethiopia. The Noble Drew Ali, the prophet of the Moorish-Americans, proclaimed that these people were "descendants of Morrocans".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=898}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beynon also noted: "The prophet’s message was characterized by his ability to utilize to the fullest measure the environment of his followers. Their physical and economic difficulties alike were used to illustrate the new teaching. Similarly, biblical prophecies and the teachings of Marcus Garvey and Noble Drew Ali were cited as foretelling the coming of the new prophet".&lt;ref name="Beynon_900"/&gt;

==Relationship with Elijah Muhammad==
With regard to [[Elijah Muhammad]], Beynon's article stated: "From among the larger group of Muslims there has sprung recently an even more militant branch than the Nation of Islam itself. This new movement, known as the Temple People, identifies the prophet, Mr. W. D. Fard, with the god Allah. To Mr. Fard alone do they offer prayer and sacrifice. Since Mr. Fard has been deified, the Temple People raise to the rank of prophet the former Minister of Islam, Elijah Mohammed, now a resident of Chicago. He is always referred to reverently as the 'Prophet Elijah in Chicago.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|pp=906–07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elijah Muhammad, who led the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975, heard Fard teach for the first time in 1931.&lt;ref name="Muhammad_64"&gt;Muhammad, Elijah (1964), Historic 1964 Buzz Anderson Interview, The Final Call&lt;/ref&gt; Elijah Muhammad stated that he and Fard became inseparable between 1931 and 1934, where he felt "jailed almost" due to the amount of time that they spent together with Fard teaching him day and night.&lt;ref name="Muhammad_64"/&gt;

A hand-written lesson written by Fard states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Twelve Leaders of Islam from all over the Planet have conferred in the Root of Civilization concerning the Lost-Found Nation of Islam – must return to their original Land. One of the Conference Members by the name of Mr. Osman Sharrieff said to the Eleven Members of the Conference: "The Lost-Found Nation of Islam will not return to their original Land unless they, first, have a thorough Knowledge of their own." So they sent a Messenger to them of their own. Now, the Messenger and his Laborers worked day and night for the last three and one-half years, and their accomplishments are approximately twenty-five thousand ...&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this lesson, Fard places the number of converts obtained in Detroit at twenty-five thousand, and he describes a "Messenger" sent to the "Lost-Found Nation of Islam" who is "of their own".&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt; Nation of Islam theology states that this "Messenger" is Elijah Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad, Jabril (1993) This is The One The Most Honored Elijah Muhammad We Need Not Look For Another, Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Fard wrote, in his instructions to the leaders of his community, that they should "copy the Answers of Lesson of Minister Elijah Muhammad."&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt; He went on to state: "Why is Stress made to the Muslims to Copy, the Minister, Elijah Muhammad's Answers? The past History shows that the ALMIGHTY ALLAH sends Prophets and Apostles for the people's Guide and Example, and through them HIS Mystery was Revealed. And those who follow the Apostle would see the Light."&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt;

Fard wrote several lessons which are read and committed to memory by members of the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"&gt;{{harvp|Muhammad|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Beynon refers to some of the lessons by Fard as an "oral tradition" that was recorded at the University of Islam as the "Secret Ritual of the Nation of Islam." See {{harvp|Beynon|1938|p=898}}. Authors have subsequently attributed a text of this title to Fard. See Evanzz, supra at 81. However, Fard's lessons were individually written lessons later compiled in a single publication. See {{harvp|Muhammad|1993}}. Language attributed to Fard by author Karl Evanzz does not appear in any of the individually written lessons.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the lessons are in the form of questions asked by Fard to Elijah Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt; One such lesson concludes with the text: "This Lesson No. 2 was given by our Prophet, W.D. Fard, which contains 40 questions answered by Elijah Muhammad, one of the lost found in the wilderness of North America February 20th, 1934."&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt;

==Ideology==
Beynon described the substance of Fard's teaching as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;The black men in North America are not Negroes, but members of the lost tribe of Shabazz, stolen by traders from the Holy City of Mecca 379 years ago. The prophet came to America to find and to bring back to life his long lost brethren, from whom the Caucasians had taken away their language, their nation and their religion. Here in America they were living other than themselves. They must learn that they are the original people, noblest of the nations of the earth. The Caucasians are the colored people, since they have lost their original color. The original people must regain their religion, which is Islam, their language, which is Arabic, and their culture, which is astronomy and higher mathematics, especially calculus. They must live according to the law of Allah, avoiding all meat of "poison animals", hogs, ducks, geese, possums and catfish. They must give up completely the use of stimulants, especially liquor. They must clean themselves up – both their bodies and their houses. If in this way they obeyed Allah, he would take them back to the Paradise from which they had been stolen – the Holy City of Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Beynon|1938|pp=900–01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fard's lessons actually state that the "trader" referenced by Beynon, came to Africa, not Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Muhammad|1993|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Nation of Islam theology is based upon the belief that Fard's teaching of Elijah Muhammad was fulfillment of scripture regarding God's teaching of an Apostle, where Fard is described as "God in Person", the "Messiah", and the "Mahdi".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Muhammad|1965|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Muhammad|1993|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fard wrote the following for his followers:&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he LESSONS that OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH) gave us to Study and Learn is the Fulfillment of the Prophecies of All the Former Prophets concerning the Beginning of the Devils, and the Ending of the Civilization, and of our Enslavement by the Devils, and Present Time of our Delivery from the Devils by OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH). PRAISE HIS HOLY NAME! There is No God but ALLAH. How that ALLAH would separate us from the Devils and, then destroy them; and Change us into a New and Perfect People; and Fill the Earth with FREEDOM, JUSTICE and EQUALITY as it was filled with wickedness; and Making we, the Poor Lost-Founds, the Perfect RULERS.&lt;ref name="Muhammad_93"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1965 book ''Message to the Blackman in America'', which is a compilation of articles written by Elijah Muhammad for various newspapers throughout the early part of his Ministry, he summarized what Fard taught him as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;He began teaching us the knowledge of ourselves, of God and the devil, of the measurement of the earth, of other planets, and of the civilization of some of the planets other than earth. ... He measured and weighed the earth and its water; the history of the moon; the history of the two nations, black and white, that dominate the earth. He gave the exact birth of the white race; the name of their God who made them and how; and the end of their time, the judgment, how it will begin and end. ... He taught us the truth of how we were made "slaves" and how we are kept in slavery by the "slave-masters{{"'}} children. He declared the doom of America, for her evils to us was past due. And that she is number one to be destroyed. Her judgment could not take place until we hear the truth. ...

He declared that we were without the knowledge of self or anyone else. How we had been made blind, deaf and dumb by this white race of people and how we must return to our people, our God and His religion of peace (Islam), the religion of the prophets. We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be destroyed from the face of the earth. He taught us that the slave-masters had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this is the cause of our sickness and short span of life. He declared that he would heal us and set us in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.&lt;ref name="harvp|Muhammad|1965|pp=16–17"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was also noted for his [[anti-Hinduism|anti-Hindu sentiments]], scholar [[A. James Gregor]] stating that: "Fard taught Elijah Muhammad than the Messenger’s entirely negative references to Hindus. Fard, as a Muslim in what was to become [[Pakistan]], bore an irrepressible prejudice against Hindus".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''The Search for Neofascism: The Use and Abuse of Social Science'', [[Cambridge University Press]] (2006), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Fard [[List of Middlesex characters|appears in the novel]] [[Middlesex (novel)|''Middlesex'']], by [[Jeffrey Eugenides]], in which Fard's Detroit Temple No. 1 is the location setting for several scenes in the book. Fard's teaching are also referenced in popular music, particularly in [[hip-hop]], by those influenced by the Nation of Islam and the Five Percent Nation. Artists who have made references within their music include: [[Jay-Z]] ("I'm going to chase the Yacub back in the cave"&lt;ref name="JayZ"&gt;Jay Z &amp; Jay Electronica, "We Made It"&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Jay Electronica]] ("Lost tribe of Shabazz stylin' on the record", "The son of W.D., who hung around in the D, Who ran around in the three, The trap gods raised me, Face all on the Sphinx, Story all in the wall of the pyramids, Niggas know the Black God saved me"&lt;ref name="JayZ"/&gt;), [[Brand Nubian]] ("This asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards, The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet earth, Father of civilization, God of the universe, Manifestin thought with my infinite styles, Making sure this travels twenty-three million miles, The other six I set the crucifix, Because the heart of the problem is this...."&lt;ref&gt;Brand Nubian, "Wake Up"&lt;/ref&gt;). Similar quotes appear in music of artists such as [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Kanye West]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Poor Righteous Teachers]] ("Holy Intellect"), [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Ice Cube]] ("Horny Lil Devil"), [[Rakim]] ("Mystery (Who Is God?)"), K-Rino ("Point number 12"), and others.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
