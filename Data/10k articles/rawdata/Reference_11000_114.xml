The '''Apobates Base''' is a marble statue base featuring the scene of an Apobates competition or [[chariot race]]. The base, which is part of the collection at the [[Acropolis Museum]] in [[Athens]], stands at {{convert|42|cm|in}} in height and {{convert|86|cm|in}} in width. A charioteer, armed athlete or warrior, and four horse-drawn chariot are depicted in profile relief. Named for the Greek “Apobatai” – literally the “Dismounters” – the base’s relief depicts the racing event or Apobates race, which was a ceremonial part of the [[Panathenaic Games]]. In this event athletes would race against other athletes by dismounting and remounting moving chariots for prizes and renown.

==Sculptural style==
The base dates to the [[Hellenistic period]], ca. 300 B.C.E. While the base dates to the Hellenistic era, [[periodization]] is not an exact science. In this case, although made during the Hellenistic era, the artistry of the base actually falls into the categorization of Late [[Classical sculpture]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Athens,+Acropolis+1326&amp;object=Sculpture|title=Athens, Acropolis 1326 (Sculpture)|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not entirely uncommon for styles to bleed over into other periods simply because specific artistic and stylistic changes are not the sole consideration for the division of periods like Classical and Hellenistic eras. Artistic styles, including that of the Apobates Base, can fall categorically into a style entirely different from the era to which they date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/antiquity/greek-sculpture-hellenistic-period.htm|title=Hellenistic Greek Sculpture|website=Visual-arts-cork.com|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Base’s Classical style is characterized by a great amount of dynamic movement, realistic and defined musculature, and greater sense of depth and dimension in sculptural figures. While a great deal of the base is damaged, the Classical style is most obvious in the dynamic pose of the athlete and figural depth of the horses.

==Depictions in art==
This event became entrenched as part of the ritual of the [[Panathenaic Games]]. Among the various athletic competitions of the Panathenaic Festival, chariot racing came to prominence - though no research to date can provide a full picture of the event. However, the event is construed to be representative of past military spectacles and was integrated into a sporting event in which athletes would dismount and remount moving chariots during a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah17321/abstract|title=The Encyclopedia of Ancient History|first=Martha C.|last=Taylor|date=7 December 2017|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|via=Wiley Online Library|doi=10.1002/9781444338386.wbeah17321/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contestants who won the Apobates race would commemorate their victory in the Panathenaia by constructing monuments and dedicatory statues. The Apobates base is one such dedication. The victors would place them in sanctuaries and Panhellenic sites. These victory monuments became artistic expressions in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/PDF/british_museum_olympic_games.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Olympic Games in Ancient Greece |website=Britishmuseum.org\accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of charioteers and chariot racing became popular thematic elements to include in [[votive]] and victory dedications, as well as grave markers and sculptural decoration. The chariot became a symbol of wealth and, as a result, contributed to conspicuous consumption in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalsporting.org/nslm/exhibition_details/619|title=National Sporting Library &amp; Museum|website=Nationalsporting.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chariot became a prominent feature of Greek art and an important part of festivals like the Panathenaia. It was because of the connotations which chariots and charioteers held in Greek society that it became such a popular subject for Greek art.

==Discovery==
Found on the west side of the Athenian Acropolis, the base supported an athletic or military victory dedication, similar to a votive dedication.  Unfortunately only the base survives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KqxzGnGzjl8C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=Apobates+base&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0OxHKbT791&amp;sig=SzTxTgOgnkPdEmGygM7qzpyump4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSnd6I8YfXAhVG8IMKHaLzDUcQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Apobates+base&amp;f=false|title=The Iconography of Sculptured Statue Bases in the Archaic and Classical Periods|first=Angeliki|last=Kosmopoulou|date=7 December 2017|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
The chariot was introduced to the Greeks through trade and interaction with the Near East ca. 1400 B.C.E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/chariot/|title=Chariot|website=Ancient.eu|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the chariot became adopted and integrated into Greek iconography. The same motif is found in some of the earliest sculpture from mainland Greece, namely the sandstone Grave Stele at [[Mycenae]] found in [[Grave Circle A]] which dates to the 16th Century B.C.E. In ancient Greek culture, the chariot and charioteer became a symbol of power and wealth because horses were very expensive and chariots themselves extremely impracticable for Greek terrain.

'''Ben Schott''' (born 26 May 1974) is a British writer, photographer, and author of the ''[[Schott's Miscellanies]]'' and ''[[Schott's Almanac]]'' series.

== Early life and university ==

Ben Schott was born in North London, England, the son of a neurologist and a nurse. He has one brother, also now a neurologist. He went to school at [[University College School]], [[Hampstead]] – both the junior school in Holly Hill and the senior school in [[Frognal]].

Schott went to [[Gonville &amp; Caius College, Cambridge]], where he read Social and Political Sciences. At Cambridge he was a regular photographer for the university student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]''. He played college [[hockey]], [[cricket]], and [[croquet]] – though not to a very high standard. He was also a member of a number of dining societies, as well as being secretary of the [[Shakespeare]] Society – one of the oldest undergraduate societies in Cambridge. He took a [[British undergraduate degree classification|double first]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ben gave up a pension – but his trivial pursuit has become a serious success |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=%2Farts%2F2002%2F12%2F13%2Fbaschot13.xml|work=The Daily Telegraph |year=2002 | location=London | accessdate=20 April 2010 |first=Andrew |last=Haldenby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Cambridge, Schott got a job at the London advertising agency [[J. Walter Thompson]] where he was as an account manager on the [[Nestle Rowntree Mackintosh|Nestlé Rowntree]] account working on [[Smarties (Nestlé)|Smarties]], [[Kit Kat]], and [[Polo mint|Polo]]. After only four months he resigned to become a [[freelance]] photographer.

== Photography ==

Schott worked as a photographer from 1996–2003, specialising in portraits of politicians and celebrities. He was commissioned by a range of editorial and commercial clients, including [[The Independent]], [[The Sunday Times]], [[Sunday Business]], [[Readers digest|Reader's Digest]], and the [[Institute of Directors]]. A profile in [[The Times]] said "his subjects included [[John Prescott]], who was rude, and [[Roy Strong|Sir Roy Strong]], who had "the most wonderful, doleful eyes" and told him: “You must realise I’m awfully photogenic.” [[Tony Blair]] asked Schott if he'd like to see then-baby [[Tony Blair#Family|Leo]]; [[Cherie Blair|Cherie]] barked at him not to take too long as they were about to have lunch."&lt;ref name="Times 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=The devil of the details |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article623578.ece|work=The Times|date=4 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His photographic portfolio is online.&lt;ref name="Schott Media"&gt;{{cite web|title=Schott Media |url=http://www.schott-media.com/main/main_frame.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schott's Miscellanies ==
{{See also|Schott's Miscellany}}
The idea for the first book originated in some cards that Schott made to send to friends, which contained booklets of what he considered vital but hard to find information.&lt;ref name="Guardian 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=The bare facts |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/bestof2002/story/0,12687,855074,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=6 November 2002 | location=London | first=Stuart | last=Jeffries | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schott typeset the book himself and had 50 copies privately printed by the Pear Tree Press in Stevenage. After sending copies out to his friends, he sent one to the CEO of [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], [[Nigel Newton]]. Newton told the [[Boston Globe]], "I was completely bowled over when it arrived on my desk. It was a work of striking originality, and it was remarkable to receive an unsolicited submission like this in the mail. I immediately passed it to one of our editors, who signed it up."&lt;ref name="Boston 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=He's a real gee-whiz kind of guy|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/11/07/hes_a_real_gee_whiz_kind_of_guy/?page=1|work=The Boston Globe|date=7 November 2006 | first=David | last=Mehegan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Schott's Original Miscellany'' was published with little fanfare, but an article by Stuart Jeffries on the front page of the Guardian's G2 section on 6 December 2002 changed everything. Describing the book as the "publishing sensation of the year", the article said that "Schott has hit the list motherlode". Sales raced up, and within weeks ''Schott's Original Miscellany'' was at No. 1. [[Robert McCrum]] said of the book in [[The Observer]]: "Originality is like charisma. It's hard to define, but we know it when we find it ... ''Schott's Original Miscellany'' is without doubt the oddest, and possibly merriest, title you will come across in a long day's march through the shimmering desert of contemporary publishing".&lt;ref name="Observer 1"&gt;{{cite news|title=God bless you, Mr Schott|url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,,855709,00.html|date=8 December 2002 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Robert | last=McCrum | accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schott followed up the success of the Original Miscellany with three sequels – ''Schott's Food &amp; Drink Miscellany'', ''Schott's Sporting, Gaming, &amp; Idling Miscellany'' and ''Schott's Quintessential Miscellany''. While the first two were best-sellers (Schott had two books simultaneously in the Sunday Times top ten), sales did not match the runaway success of the first book.

The Miscellany trilogy has sold well over 2 million copies,{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and has been translated and adapted into dozens of languages, including French, Russian, Greek, Swedish, Finnish, Italian, Serbian, Spanish, Hungarian and Japanese.

== Schott's Almanacs ==
{{See also|Schott's Almanac}}
The first edition of ''[[Schott's Almanac]]'' was published in Britain in 2005, followed by yearly editions published in Britain, [[United States|America]], and Germany until 2010. The Almanacs shared the same look and feel as the Miscellanies – but were substantially longer and larger. Each edition was different, although some content was shared or adapted. The British edition had sections on The World; Society; Media &amp; Celebrity; Music &amp; Movies; Books &amp; Arts; Science &amp; Technology; Parliament &amp; Politics; Form &amp; Faith; [[The Establishment]]; Sport; and an [[Ephemerides]] section that contains traditional almanac information on dates, moon phases, and the season. The Sunday Times called Schott's Almanac "a social barometer of genuine historical value"; the Boston Globe called it "One of the oddest and most addictively readable reference books in print". Schott introduced the 2006 Almanac with a quote from [[Ben Hecht]]: "Trying to determine what is going on in the world by reading newspapers is like trying to tell the time by watching the second hand of a clock".

==Other works==
In November 2018 his first novel, ''Jeeves and the King of Clubs'', was published by Little, Brown and Company. It was written as a homage to P. G. Woodhouse, with the blessing of the Wodehouse Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.littlebrown.com/titles/ben-schott/jeeves-and-the-king-of-clubs/9780316524605/|title=Jeeves and the King of Clubs|last=Schott|first=Ben|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=2018|isbn=978-0316524605|location=|pages=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalism==

For two years after the publication of the first Miscellany, Schott wrote a weekly miscellany column for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', and also produced special miscellany features on Christmas and the [[Olympics]]. For over a year he wrote a regular travel miscellany column for the UK edition of [[Condé Nast Traveler magazine]]. In 2005 and 2006 the ''Guardian'' featured special editions of G2 featuring extracts from Schott's Almanac.

In 2008 Schott was appointed as a Contributing Columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'' OpEd page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id%3D1003788757 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413073546/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003788757 |archivedate=13 April 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also writes regular features for ''[[The Times]]''.

Schott publishes a [[bespoke]] Miscellany [[Diary]] with the society printers [[Smythson of Bond Street]], and a desk-pad diary with Workman.

==Design==

Schott typesets all of his books and most of his articles – now using Adobe's [[InDesign]] after apparently abandoning [[QuarkXPress]]. His books are noted for specifying the precise design tools (fonts, leading, etc.) that he employs. He has regularly acknowledged the influence of the work of [[Edward Tufte]] in influencing the look and feel of his books.&lt;ref name="The Independent 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Book of a lifetime|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051209/ai_n15922516|author=The Independent}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic cover illustrations for his books are created by Alison Lang, and the drawing inside the Almanacs are by Chris Lyon.

In 2004, he won a [[D&amp;AD]] award for the design of ''Schott's Food &amp; Drink Miscellany''.&lt;ref name="DAD1"&gt;{{cite web|title=D&amp;AD awards 2004 |url=http://www.dandad.org/awards2004/Awards_2004v1.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026152642/http://www.dandad.org/awards2004/Awards_2004v1.pdf |archivedate=26 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Burney Collection''' consists of over 1,270 17th-18th century newspapers and other news materials, gathered by [[Charles Burney (scholar)|Charles Burney]], most notable for the 18th-century London newspapers. The original collection, totalling almost 1 million pages, is held by the [[British Library]].

== Contents of the collection ==
===Highlights===
Key objects in the collection include:
*The financial scandal of the 1720s, the South Sea bubble, with reports in the ''Weekly Journal'' or ''Saturday’s Post'' of how Parliament decided that if they left the country, the directors of the South Sea company "shall suffer death as a felon without benefit of clergy and forfeit to the King all his Lands, Goods and Chattels whatsoever."
*First advertisement for ''[[The Memoirs of Fanny Hill]]'' in the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'', 6 March 1750, and then, in the issue of 17 March, a report of how the publisher was taken into custody and all copies were seized.
* Insight into English attitudes to contemporary events, such as when the ''[[English Chronicle|English Chronicle, or, Universal Evening Post]]'' used the unusual device of a headline –  FRENCH REVOLUTION!! –  for a whole page article on 18 of July 1789. It reported sympathetically on the fall of the Bastille four days earlier, including how the officers were decapitated in ‘a sad but necessary spectacle...a solemnity worthy of the highest admiration.’

===Summary===

== Preservation and access ==
===Microfilm===
Due to rapid deterioration of the collection, a decision was made to microfilm the collection and restrict access to physical copies. The success of the microfilm project led to many other book collections being preserved on film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Library Publishing |series=British Library Occasional Papers 2| chapter=Publishing and preservation |first=Nicholas |last=Barker |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;big&gt;'''Background and Need'''&lt;/big&gt; ==
           Archives by their very nature are different from libraries. While libraries contain individual items, such as books and journals, of which multiple, identical copies exist, archives contain records that are both unique and interrelated.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encoded Archival Description on the Internet|last=PItti, and Duff|first=Daniel V. and Wendy M.|publisher=The Haworth Information Press|year=2001|isbn=0-7890-1397-5|location=Oxford|pages=1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;Archives represent the activities of a person, family or organization that are created and accumulated naturally in the course of their ordinary activities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In contrast to the items in a library, therefore, all the items in an archival collection share a relationship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The entire body of the records of an organization, family or individual have been created and accumulated as a byproduct of the organization or individual’s existence, and therefore share a common origin, which is referred to by archivists as its ''provenance''; ''provenance'' refers to both the origin of an item or collection as well as its custody and ownership.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|publisher=Society of American Archivists|year=2005|isbn=1-931666-14-8|location=Chicago|pages=173-174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archivists refer to the entire body or records of an individual or organization as its ''fonds''; the ''fonds'' is thus a conceptual whole that reflects the process of the production or accumulation of records that share a common function or activity and exhibit a natural unity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A ''fonds'' may contain anywhere from one item to millions of items, and may consist in any form, including manuscripts, charts, drawings, maps, audio, video or electronic records.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Because published materials differ in significant and fundamental ways from the collections of interrelated and unique materials found in archives, there are significant differences in bibliographic and archival description.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  A bibliographic description represents an individual published item, is based on and derived from the physical item and is thus considered item-level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Archival description, by contrast represents a collection, or a fonds, often containing individual items of various media, sharing a common origin, or provenance.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Cook, "The Concept of the Archival Fonds: Theory, Description, and Provenance in the Post-Custodial Era", in Terry Eastwood (ed.), The Archival Fonds: From Theory to Practice (Ottawa: Bureau of Canadian Archivists, Planning Committee on Descriptive Standards, 1992), pp. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The description of archival materials, therefore, involves a complex hierarchical and progressive analysis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  It begins by describing the whole, then moves down to subcomponents; the description frequently does not extend to the item level.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=Pitti|first=Daniel V.|title=Encoded Archival Description (EAD)|date=2009|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1081/e-elis3-120044047|work=Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences, Third Edition|volume=|pages=1699–1707|publisher=CRC Press|doi=10.1081/e-elis3-120044047|isbn=9780849397127|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way archival description focuses on the intellectual structure and content of the collection rather than its physical characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duff and Harris|first=Wendy and Verne|date=2002|title=Stories and Names:  Archival Description as Narrating Records and Constructing Meanings|url=https://link-springer-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF02435625|journal=Archival Science|volume=2|pages=263-285|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

           A finding aid is a tool that helps users to find materials within an archive through the description of its contents.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  Most findings aids provide similar types of information, including, at a minimum, a title that connects the finding aid to the creator of the collection; a summary of the material contained in the finding aid; background and context of the collection, including major figures involved; and information about the custody of the collection as well as any conditions or restrictions regarding its use.&lt;ref&gt;Dow, E.  (2005).  ''Creating EAD-Compatible Finding Guides on Paper.''  Scarecrow Press: Oxford (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

           The unique nature of archival records and the geographic distribution of individual collections has presented a challenge for those wishing to locate and access them for over 150 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  With the advent of international networked computing and online catalogs, however, the potential emerged for making archival collections searchable online.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== '''History''' ==
EAD originated at the 1993 Society of American Archivists annual meeting in [[New Orleans]] and was headed by Daniel Pitti at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encoded Archival Description: Context, Theory, and Case Studies|last = |first = |publisher = The Society of American Archivists|year = 1998|isbn = 0931828430|location = Chicago|pages = |editor-last = Dooley|editor-first = Jackie M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's goal was to create a data standard for describing archives, similar to the [[MARC standards]] for describing bibliographic materials. The initial EAD Version 1.0 was released in the fall of 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encoded Archival Description on the Internet|last = |first = |publisher = The Hawthorn Information Press|year = 2001|isbn = 0789013975|location = Binghamton, N.Y.|pages = |editor-last = Pitti|editor-first = Daniel V.|editor-last2 = Duff|editor-first2 = Wendy M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a standard enables [[archives]], [[museum]]s, [[libraries]], and manuscript repositories to list and describe their holdings in a manner that would be machine-readable and therefore easy to search, maintain and exchange.&lt;ref name="EADofficalsite"&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of the Encoded Archival Description DTD|url=https://www.loc.gov/ead/eaddev.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, many [[archives]] and [[special collections]] have adopted it.

In addition to the development and maintenance work done by the Society of American Archivists and the Library of Congress, the [[Research Libraries Group]] (RLG) has developed and published a set of "Best Practice" implementation guidelines&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/past/rlg/ead/bpg.pdf], RLG Best Practice Guidelines for Encoded Archival Description, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; for EAD, which lays out mandatory, recommended, and optional elements and attributes. RLG has also provided a kind of clearinghouse for finding aids in EAD format, known as [[ArchiveGrid]]. Member libraries provide RLG the URL for their finding aids; RLG automatically [[Metadata discovery#Lexical Matching|harvests]] data from the finding aids, indexes it, and provides a search interface for the index, thus giving researchers the ability to search across several hundred institutions' collections with a single query. RLG also has developed the "RLG Report Card,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/past/rlg/ead/reportcard.htm], RLG EAD Report Card.&lt;/ref&gt; an automated quality-checking program that will analyze an EAD instance and report any areas where it diverges from the best practices guidelines.

SAA's Technical Subcommittee for Encoded Archival Description, which include international representation, embarked on a revision of the EAD standard in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;"EAD Revision Under Way," Library of Congress, https://www.loc.gov/ead/eadrevision.html&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version, EAD3, was released in August 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EAD3 1.0 is available! {{!}} Society of American Archivists|url = http://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-encoded-archival-description-ead/ead3-10-is-available|website = www2.archivists.org|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Adoption'''==
A number of repositories in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Australia]] and elsewhere have adopted and implemented EAD with varying levels of technical sophistication. One of the most ambitious efforts is the [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ Online Archive of California], a [[union catalog]] of over 5000 EAD finding aids covering manuscripts and images from institutions across the state. The [http://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/ French National Library Francois Mitterrand] publishes more than 90000 EAD finding aids covering archives and manuscripts.

=='''EAD Element Set'''==
The EAD standard's [[XML schema]] specifies the elements to be used to describe a manuscript collection as well as the arrangement of those elements (for example, which elements are required, or which are permitted inside which other elements).  The EAD tag set has 146 elements and is used both to describe a collection as a whole, and also to encode a detailed multi-level inventory of the collection.  Many EAD elements have been, or can be, mapped to content standards (such as [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard|DACS]] and [[ISAD(G)]]) and other structural standards (such as MARC or [[Dublin Core]]), increasing the flexibility and [[interoperability]] of the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stockting | first1 = B | year = 2004 | title = Time to Settle Down? EAD Encoding Principles in the Access to Archives Programme (A2A) and the Research Libraries Group's Best Practice Guidelines | url = | journal = Journal of Archival Organization | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 7–24 | doi=10.1300/j201v02n03_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EAD 1.0 was an [[SGML]] [[document type definition]] (DTD). EAD 2002, the second incarnation of EAD, was finalized in December 2002 and made available as an [[XML]] DTD.   The latest version of EAD, EAD3, is available as both an [[XML schema]] and a DTD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://github.com/SAA-SDT/EAD3 EAD schema and other files for download via GitHub]&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Parts of an EAD Finding Aid'''==

''Note: Examples in this section are EAD2, and may not be valid against the EAD3 schema.''

===eadheader===

''Note: In the current release of EAD3 1.0, the eadheader element has been replaced with the control element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = EAD: Encoded Archival Description (EAD Official Site, Library of Congress)|url = https://www.loc.gov/ead/|website = www.loc.gov|accessdate = 2016-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

The first section of an EAD-encoded finding aid is the &lt;code&gt;eadheader&lt;/code&gt;.  This section contains the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; and optional &lt;code&gt;subtitle&lt;/code&gt; of the collection and detailed information about the finding aid itself: who created it, when it was created, its [[revision history]], the language the finding aid is written in, and so on.  The &lt;code&gt;eadheader&lt;/code&gt; itself has a number of required attributes that map to various [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards such as [[ISO 3166-1]] for country codes and [[ISO 8601]] for date formats.

The &lt;code&gt;eadheader&lt;/code&gt; and its child elements can be mapped to other standards for easy interchange of information.  They are often mapped to Dublin Core elements such as Creator, Author, Language.  For example, in the excerpt below the &lt;code&gt;relatedencoding="DC"&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;eadheader&lt;/code&gt; element specifies that child elements will be mapped to Dublin Core; the child element &lt;code&gt;&lt;author encodinganalog="Creator"&gt;&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the EAD element &lt;code&gt;&lt;author&gt;&lt;/code&gt; maps to the Dublin Core element &lt;code&gt;&lt;creator&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Example of an eadheader:

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;eadheader audience="internal" countryencoding="iso3166-1" 
dateencoding="iso8601" langencoding="iso639-2b" 
relatedencoding="DC" repositoryencoding="iso15511" 
scriptencoding="iso15924"&gt;
   &lt;eadid countrycode="us" identifier="bachrach_lf" mainagencycode="NSyU"&gt;bachrach_lf&lt;/eadid&gt;

         &lt;language encodinganalog="Language" langcode="eng"&gt;English&lt;/language&gt;
      &lt;/langusage&gt;
   &lt;/profiledesc&gt;
&lt;/eadheader&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===archdesc===
The &lt;code&gt;archdesc&lt;/code&gt; section contains the description of the collection material itself.  First, the ''Descriptive Identification'' or &lt;code&gt;did&lt;/code&gt; element contains a description of the collection as a whole, including the creator (which may be an individual or an organization), size (usually given in linear feet), inclusive dates, language(s), and an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] or brief description.  As with the &lt;code&gt;eadheader&lt;/code&gt; above, elements may be mapped to corresponding standards; elements in this section are usually mapped to MARC elements.  For example, in the excerpt below the &lt;code&gt;relatedencoding="MARC21"&lt;/code&gt; attribute of the &lt;code&gt;archdesc&lt;/code&gt; element specifies that child elements will be mapped to MARC21; the child element &lt;code&gt;&lt;unittitle encodinganalog="245$a" label="Title: "&gt;&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the &lt;code&gt;unittitle&lt;/code&gt; element maps to MARC field 245, subfield a.

Example:

&lt;source lang="xml" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;archdesc level="collection" type="inventory" relatedencoding="MARC21"&gt;
   &lt;did&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;Overview of the Collection&lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;repository encodinganalog="852$a" label="Repository: "&gt;Blank University&lt;/repository&gt;
      &lt;origination label="Creator: "&gt;
         &lt;persname encodinganalog="100"&gt;Brightman, Samuel C. (Samuel Charles), 1911-1992&lt;/persname&gt;
      &lt;/origination&gt;
      &lt;unittitle encodinganalog="245$a" label="Title: "&gt;Samuel C. Brightman Papers&lt;/unittitle&gt;
      &lt;unitdate encodinganalog="245$f" normal="1932/1992" type="inclusive" label="Inclusive Dates: "&gt;1932-1992&lt;/unitdate&gt;
      &lt;physdesc encodinganalog="300$a" label="Quantity: "&gt;
         &lt;extent&gt;6 linear ft.&lt;/extent&gt;
      &lt;/physdesc&gt;
      &lt;abstract encodinganalog="520$a" label="Abstract: "&gt;
          Papers of the American journalist including some war correspondence, 
          political and political humor writings, and adult education material
      &lt;/abstract&gt;
      &lt;unitid encodinganalog="099" label="Identification: " countrycode="us" repositorycode="NSyU"&gt;2458163&lt;/unitid&gt;
      &lt;langmaterial label="Language: " encodinganalog="546"&gt;
         &lt;language langcode="eng"&gt;English&lt;/language&gt;
      &lt;/langmaterial&gt;
   &lt;/did&gt;
&lt;/archdesc&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Several additional descriptive elements may follow the &lt;code&gt;did&lt;/code&gt; including:

* &lt;code&gt;bioghist&lt;/code&gt; - biographic description of the person or organization
* &lt;code&gt;scopecontent&lt;/code&gt; - a detailed [[narrative]] description of the collection material
* &lt;code&gt;relatedmaterial&lt;/code&gt; - description of items which the repository acquired separately but which are related to this collection, and which a researcher might want to be aware of
* &lt;code&gt;separatedmaterial&lt;/code&gt; - items which the repository acquired as part of this collection but which have been separated from it, perhaps for special treatment, storage needs, or cataloging
* &lt;code&gt;controlaccess&lt;/code&gt; - a list of subject headings or keywords for the collection, usually drawn from an [[controlled vocabulary|authoritative source]] such as [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] or the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]]
* &lt;code&gt;accessrestrict&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;userestrict&lt;/code&gt; - statement concerning any restrictions on the material in the collection
* &lt;code&gt;arrangement&lt;/code&gt; - the way in which the materials in the collection are arranged

The second, and usually largest, section of the &lt;code&gt;archdesc&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;dsc&lt;/code&gt;, which contains a full inventory of the collection broken down into progressively smaller intellectual chunks.  EAD offers two options: the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; element which can be nested within itself to an unlimited level, and a set of numbered container elements &lt;code&gt;c01&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;c12&lt;/code&gt; which can only be nested numerically (i.e. a &lt;code&gt;c01&lt;/code&gt; can contain only a &lt;code&gt;c02&lt;/code&gt;; a &lt;code&gt;c02&lt;/code&gt; can contain only a &lt;code&gt;c03&lt;/code&gt;, and so on).  Note that the &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c0#&lt;/code&gt; elements refer to ''intellectual'' subdivisions of the material; the actual physical container is specified using the &lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt; element.  The inventory may go down to as detailed a level as desired.  The example below shows an inventory to the folder level.

Example of an inventory:

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;dsc type="combined"&gt;&lt;head&gt;Inventory&lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;c01&gt;
      &lt;did&gt;
        &lt;unittitle&gt;Correspondence&lt;/unittitle&gt;
      &lt;/did&gt;
      &lt;c02&gt;
         &lt;did&gt;
            &lt;unittitle&gt;Adams, Martha&lt;/unittitle&gt;
            &lt;unitdate normal="1962/1967"&gt;1962-1967&lt;/unitdate&gt;
            &lt;container type="box"&gt;1&lt;/container&gt;
            &lt;container type="folder"&gt;1&lt;/container&gt;
         &lt;/did&gt;
      &lt;/c02&gt;
      &lt;c02&gt;
         &lt;did&gt;
            &lt;unittitle&gt;Barnett, Richard&lt;/unittitle&gt;
            &lt;unitdate normal="1965"&gt;1965&lt;/unitdate&gt;
            &lt;container type="box"&gt;1&lt;/container&gt;
            &lt;container type="folder"&gt;2&lt;/container&gt;
         &lt;/did&gt;
      &lt;/c02&gt;
      ...etc
   &lt;/c01&gt;
   &lt;c01&gt;
      &lt;did&gt;
        &lt;unittitle&gt;Writings&lt;/unittitle&gt;
      &lt;/did&gt;
      &lt;c02&gt;
         &lt;did&gt;
            &lt;unittitle&gt;Short stories&lt;/unittitle&gt;
            &lt;unitdate normal="1959/1979"&gt;1959-1979&lt;/unitdate&gt;
            &lt;container type="box"&gt;5&lt;/container&gt;
            &lt;container type="folder"&gt;1-9&lt;/container&gt;
         &lt;/did&gt;
      &lt;/c02&gt;
   &lt;/c01&gt;
&lt;/dsc&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=='''Citing EAD'''==
There have been some studies about how to cite EAD files with variable granularity. In particular, Buneman and Silvello&lt;ref&gt;Buneman, P. and Silvello, G. (2010). ‘A Rule-Based Citation System for Structured and Evolving Datasets’. IEEE Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering, Vol. 3, No. 3. IEEE Computer Society, pp. 33-41, September 2010. Available online: http://sites.computer.org/debull/A10sept/buneman.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a rule-based system to automatically create citation snippets to be used as references when citing XML data; a case study is based on EAD. Furthermore, Silvello&lt;ref&gt;Silvello, G. (2016). ‘Learning to Cite Framework: How to Automatically Construct Citations for Hierarchical Data’.  Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology (JASIST), to appear, 2016. Pre-print available online: http://www.dei.unipd.it/~silvello/papers/2016-DataCitation-JASIST-Silvello.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a framework, which learning from examples, automatically creates references at different level of coarseness for XML files. This framework has been tested on the Library of Congress collection of EAD files.Criticism

A user study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freund | first1 = L. | last2 = Toms | first2 = E. G. | year = 2016 | title = Interacting with Archival Finding Aids | doi = 10.1002/asi.23436 | journal = Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology | volume = 67 | issue = 4| pages = 994–1008}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzing the user interaction patterns with finding aids highlighted that "[they] focus on rules for description rather than on facilitating access to and use of the materials they list and describe", and that many archive users have serious issues using finding aids. Common and frequent user interaction patterns with finding aids are navigational and thus they require to browse the archival hierarchy to make sense of the archival data.&lt;ref&gt;N. Ferro and G. Silvello (2016). `From Users to Systems: Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Efficiently Access Archival Data`. ACHS@JCDL 2016. http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1611/paper2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics claim that EAD constrains researcher interaction because several operations are either impossible or inefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferro | first1 = N. | last2 = Silvello | first2 = G. | year = 2013 | title = NESTOR: A Formal Model for Digital Archives | url = | journal = Information Processing &amp; Management | volume = 49 | issue = 6| pages = 1206–1240 | doi = 10.1016/j.ipm.2013.05.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it is problematic to: 
* let the user access a specific item on-the-fly, since it requires defining fixed access points to the archival hierarchy;&lt;ref&gt;N. Ferro and G. Silvello. A Methodology for Sharing Archival Descriptive Metadata in a Distributed Environment. In Proc. 12th European Conference on Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries, pages 268–279. LNCS 5173, Springer, Germany, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* let the user reconstruct the context of an item without browsing the whole archival hierarchy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daines | first1 = J. G. | last2 = Nimer | first2 = C. L. | year = 2011 | title = Re-Imagining Archival Display: Creating User-Friendly Finding Aids | url = | journal = Journal of Archival Organization | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 4–31 | doi=10.1080/15332748.2011.574019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* present the user with only selected items from an archive, since the finding aid presents a given collection as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;M. Y. Eidson. "Describing Anything That Walks: The Problem Behind the Problem of EAD", ''Journal of Archival Organization'' 1(4) 5–28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roth | first1 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Serving Up EAD: An Exploratory Study on the Deployment and Utilization of Encoded Archival Description Finding Aids | url = | journal = The American Archivists | volume = 64 | issue = 2| pages = 214–237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, EAD allows for several degrees of freedom in tagging practice, which may turn out to be problematic in the automatic processing of EAD files, since it is difficult to know in advance how an institution will use the hierarchical elements. It has been underlined that only EAD files meeting stringent best practice guidelines are shareable and searchable.&lt;ref&gt;Prom, C.J., Rishel, C.A., Schwartz, S.W., Fox, K.J. (2007). "A Unified Platform for Archival Description and Access". In: Proc. 7th ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2007), pp. 157–166. ACM Press, New York (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enclib.jpg|thumb|First edition in 73 volumes (1968-2003) and 2nd edition in 4 volumes (2003).]]
The '''''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences''''' (until third edition in the singular: ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science'') is an [[encyclopedia]] for [[library]] and [[Information science]] related issues.

==History==
It was first published 1968-2003 in 73 volumes under the editorship of Allen Kent, Harold Lancour and Jay E. Daily. Second edition edited by Miriam Drake was published 2003 in 4 volumes, third edition edited by Marcia J. Bates and Mary Niles Maack came in 2010 in seven volumes and fourth edition edited by John D. McDonald and Michael Levine-Clark came in 2017 also in seven volumes.

==Reviews==
Joseph C. Meredith published a “Review of Reviews,” &lt;ref&gt;Meredith, Joseph C. (1980). The Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science: a review of reviews, a summary evaluation and a suggested salvage operation. ''Canadian Library Journal'', December issue, pp. 411–19.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizing thirty-nine earlier reviews of the first edition. His findings mentions “omissions, errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies; inadequate cross references; lack of uniformity of style; lack of balance in the length of articles; inadequate references and bibliographies.” He concludes that “although as an encyclopedia, the encyclopedia is a failure, it contains many excellent articles.”

James D. Anderson reviewed the 2nd edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, James D. (2004). Review: Miriam A. Drake, The Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science. ''The Library Quarterly'' 74(3), 384-386.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that "Regretfully, many of the problems of the first edition have been inherited, even exacerbated, by the second edition" and concluded: "This new second edition turns out to be not so new after all, especially with regard to the most basic articles. It cannot be recommended, especially for libraries that own the first edition. Overall, it appears to be a spin-off aimed primarily at making money rather than describing the state of the art in the twenty-first century. It reminds us of the drug companies that change the color of a pill in order to get a brand new patent."

The third edition was reviewed by Tony Chalcraft&lt;ref&gt;Chalcraft, Tony (2011). Review: Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences, 3rd Ed., Editor-in-Chief Marcia J. Bates, Associate Editor, Mary Niles Maack. ''Reference Reviews'' 25(1), 9-11.&lt;/ref&gt; He notes: "Of the 565 articles, more than 400 are completely new to this edition, amounting to about 70 percent of total material." Whereas ELIS2 was devoted solely to library and information science, ELIS3 addresses in addition "archival science, museum studies and records management...as well as...bibliography, informatics, information systems and social studies of information." He concludes: "unquestioned achievement collecting material on the wide field of library and information sciences unobtainable elsewhere. There is simply no other work that comes near it in scale or spread and for librarians and information specialists it must be regarded as the pre-eminent reference source for the profession." The editor-in-chief wrote about the scope of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Marcia J. (2007). "Defining the information disciplines in encyclopedia development" ''Information Research'', 12(4) paper colis29. [Available at http://InformationR.net/ir/12-4/colis/colis29.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.''' is a Scottish-founded, now American [[company]] best known for publishing the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the world's oldest continuously published [[encyclopedia]].

==History==
[[File:BRITANNICA Photo Walk Chicago September 2, 2013-4870.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Current location in Chicago]]
The company was founded in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, in the 18th century, in the atmosphere of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. A printer, [[Colin Macfarquhar]], and an engraver, [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], formed a partnership to create a new book that would embody the new spirit of scholarship. [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]] was engaged to edit the original three-volume work, published one volume at a time beginning in 1768.

The encyclopaedia's reputation grew throughout the publication of its subsequent volumes.

===Sears Roebuck===
The [[11th edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica|11th edition]] was published in 1910-1911.

In 1920, the [[trademark]] and publication rights were sold to [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]], which held them until 1943, when ownership passed to [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]].

The 12th edition was published in 1921-1922, and the 13th edition was published in 1926.

A thoroughly revised 14th edition was published in 1929.

By the mid-1930s, the company headquarters had moved to [[Chicago]], Illinois, United States, and the editorial staff were now no longer disbanded after the completion of a new edition, but kept on as a permanent editorial department, to keep pace with the rapid increase in knowledge at the time.

Starting in 1936, a new printing of the encyclopaedia was published each year, incorporating the latest changes and updates. In 1938, the first edition of the ''[[Britannica Book of the Year]]'' appeared. This annual supplement is still published today.

===William Benton===
[[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]] published the Britannica from 1943 until his death in 1973. After the death of his widow Helen Benton in 1974, the [[Benton Foundation]] continued to manage the Britannica until it was sold to [[Jacqui Safra]] in 1996.

In 1947, Britannica released ''[[10 Eventful Years]]'', a compendium of [[World War II]] in 4 volumes.

In 1952, Britannica published the landmark set ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]'', a 54-volume set of the "great books" of Western culture.

Publishing rights to ''[[Compton's Encyclopedia]]'' were acquired by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. in 1961.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Inc.]] has been a subsidiary of Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. since 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/376313/Merriam-Webster-Inc "Topic Merriam-Webster-dictionary on britannica.com"]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 1976 the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. from using a) deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads, and b) deceptive sales practices in the door-to-door presentations of its sales agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/commission_decision_volumes/volume-87/ftc_volume_decision_87_january_-_june_1976pages_400-541.pdf|title=In the Matter of Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. et al., pp.421-541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jacqui Safra===

Jacqui Safra gained ownership in 1996.

Under Safra's ownership the company has experienced some financial woes with freelance contributors waiting up to six months for payment and staff going years without pay raises, according to a report in the ''[[New York Post]]''. Cost-cutting measures have included mandates to use copyright free photos. Britannica in December 2002 told employees it would raise the contribution paid into their [[401(k)]] accounts, then eliminated them entirely. A company spokesman said: "We've had some cost reductions and belt-tightening but we're not going into details… We're a privately held company."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040821114744/http://entertainment.excite.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_11_2003_11.html "Cash-shy Britannica"], ''New York Post'', 11 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Flora Huayaquilensis''''' is the popular name for the body of work produced by botanist Juan José Tafalla Navascués while he was in South America.

Navascués made one of the first expeditions to South America with a Spaniard who documented plants of the area. His unpublished works were kept in the archives for 200 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteshoy.com/?p=4263%7CEduardo%20Eduardo%20Estrella|title=Eduardo Estrella: “Juan Tafalla.

In 1985, [[Eduardo Estrella Aguirre|Eduardo Estrella]] was researching in the archives of the [[Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid|Royal Botanical Gardens in Madrid]], [[Spain]], when he found the documents of the "Fourth Division," for the expedition of Ruiz and Pavon in Peru and Chile. Estrella found descriptions of plants whose origins correspond to the places belonging to the [[Royal Audience of Quito]].

The folios were numbered and contained the mysterious initials FH. Other folios that did not correspond to the flora of the Royal Court had the initials FP. The work was eventually published, credited to Navascués' expedition. The [[Botanical Expedition to the Viceroyalty of Peru]] was very similar to Navascués' expedition. Estrella founded the [[Ecuador National Museum of Medicine]].[http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101655266/-1/Morainville_y_Tafalla__tras_la_huella_de_la_quina.html#.U0dQk6h5MRF]&lt;ref&gt;[http://instituciones.msp.gob.ec/museo/ Official web site of the [[Eduardo Estrella Aguirre|Dr. Eduardo Estrella]] [[Ecuador National Museum of Medicine]] in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all early explorers of Ecuador had their documents survive. [[Theodor Wolf]] (February 13, 1841 - June 22, 1924) was a [[Germany|German]] [[naturalist]] who studied the [[Galápagos Islands]] during the late nineteenth century. [[Wolf Island]] (Wenman Island) is named after him. Wolf had performed a geologic survey of mainland [[Ecuador]], but his collections were lost in storage.&lt;ref&gt;Edward John Larson, ''Evolution’s Workshop: God and Science on the Galapagos Islands'' (Basic Books, 2001), 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Froissart's ''Chronicles''''' (or '''''Chroniques''''') are a prose history of the [[Hundred Years' War]] written in the 14th century by [[Jean Froissart]]. The ''Chronicles'' open with the events leading up to the deposition of [[Edward II]] in 1326, and cover the period up to 1400, recounting events in western Europe, mainly in England, France, Scotland, the [[Low Countries]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], although at times also mentioning other countries and regions such as Italy, Germany, Ireland, the [[Balkans]], [[Cyprus]], [[Turkey]] and North Africa.

For centuries the ''Chronicles'' have been recognized as the chief expression of the [[chivalric]] culture of 14th-century England and France. [[Froissart]]'s work is perceived as being of vital importance to informed understandings of the European 14th century, particularly of the Hundred Years' War.  But modern historians also recognize that the ''Chronicles'' have many shortcomings as a historical source: they contain erroneous dates, have misplaced geography, give inaccurate estimations of sizes of armies and casualties of war, and may be biased in favour of the author's patrons.

Although Froissart is sometimes repetitive or covers seemingly insignificant subjects, his battle descriptions are lively and engaging.  For the earlier periods Froissart based his work on other existing chronicles, but his own experiences, combined with those of interviewed witnesses, supply much of the detail of the later books. Although Froissart may never have been in a battle, he visited [[Sluys]] in 1386 to see the preparations for an invasion of England.  He was present at other significant events such as the baptism of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] in [[Bordeaux]] in 1367, the coronation of King [[Charles V of France]] in [[Rheims]] in 1380, the marriage of [[John, Duke of Berry|Duke John of Berry]] and [[Joan II, Countess of Auvergne|Jeanne of Boulogne]] in Riom and the joyous entry of the French queen [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] in Paris, both in 1389.

[[Sir Walter Scott]] once remarked that Froissart had "marvellous little sympathy" for the "villain churls."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ChpRAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;ots=EUIOh2nb5F&amp;dq=%22marvelous%20little%20sympathy%22%20for%20the%20%22villain%20churls&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q=%22marvelous%20little%20sympathy%22%20for%20the%20%22villain%20churls&amp;f=false Sir Walter Scott: Tales of my landlord]. 
As used here, "villain" means "[[villein]]".&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that Froissart often omits to talk about the common people, but that is largely the consequence of his stated aim to write not a general chronicle but a history of the chivalric exploits that took place during the wars between France and England. Nevertheless, Froissart was not indifferent to the wars' effects on the rest of society. His Book II focuses extensively on popular revolts in different parts of western Europe (France, England and Flanders) and in this part of the ''Chronicles'' the author often demonstrates good understanding of the factors that influenced local economies and their effect on society at large; he also seems to have a lot of sympathy in particular for the plight of the poorer strata of the urban populations of Flanders.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ainsworth, 'Froissardian perspectives on late-fourteenth-century society', in Jeffrey Denton and Brian Pullan (eds.), ''Orders and Hierarchies in Late Medieval and Renaissance Europe'' (Basingstoke / London: Macmillan Press, 1999), pp. 56-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chronicles'' are a very extensive work: with their almost 1.5 million words, they are amongst the longest works written in French prose in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Croenen|first=Godfried|title=Online Froissart|url=http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/apparatus.jsp?type=context&amp;context=how_the_material_was_selected|publisher=HRIOnline|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Few modern complete editions have been published, but the text was printed from the late 15th century onwards. [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]] continued the ''Chronicles'' to 1440, while [[Jean de Wavrin]] incorporated large parts of it in his own work. [[Robert Gaguin]]'s ''Compendium super origine et gestis Francorum'' made ample use of Froissart.&lt;ref&gt;Franck Collart, ''Un historien au travail à la fin du XVe siècle: Robert Gaguin'' (Geneva: Droz, 1996), 121-122, 341-344.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th and 16th centuries the Chronicles were translated into Dutch, English, Latin, Spanish, Italian and Danish.  The text of Froissart's Chronicles is preserved in more than 150 manuscripts, many of which are illustrated, some extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried Croenen, 'Froissart illustration cycles', in Graeme Dunphy (ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle'' (Leiden: Brill, 2010), I, 645-650.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:The Dukes of Berry and Burgundy Departing from Paris to Meet with the Duke of Bretagne.jpg|thumb|The Dukes of Berry and Burgundy leaving Paris to meet with the Duke of Bretagne, miniature of 1480-83]]
[[Jean Froissart]] came from [[Valenciennes]] in the [[County of Hainaut]], situated in the western tip of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], bordering France (it is now in France).  He seems to have come from what we would today call a middle-class background, but spent much of his adult life in courts, and took on the world-view of the late medieval feudal aristocracy, who initially represented his readership. He appears to have gained his living as a writer, and was a notable French poet in his day. At least by the end of his life he had taken [[holy orders]], and received a profitable [[benefice]].

He first wrote a rhyming chronicle for the English queen [[Philippa of Hainault]], which he offered to her in 1361 or 1362.&lt;ref&gt;Normand R. Cartier, 'The lost chronicle', ''Speculum'' 36 (1961), 424-434; Peter F. Ainsworth, ''Jean Froissart and the Fabric of History: Truth, Myth, and Fiction in the Chroniques'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1990), pp. 32-50; Jean Devaux, 'From the court of Hainault to the court of England: the example of Jean Froissart', in Christopher Allmand (ed.), ''War, Government and Power in Late Medieval France'' (Liverpool: Liverpool UP, 2000), pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The text of this earliest historical work, which Froissart himself mentioned in the prologue of his ''Chronicles'', is usually considered to have been completely lost, but some scholars have argued that a 14th-century manuscript containing a rhyming chronicle, of which fragments are now kept in libraries in Paris and Berlin, may be identified as this so-called 'lost chronicle'.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Stutzmann, 'Un deuxième fragment du poème historique de Froissart', ''Bibliothèque de l'Ecole des Chartes'', 164 (2006), 573-580.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and sources==
Froissart began writing Book I of the surviving prose chronicle sometime after 1370, possibly at the request of [[Robert de Namur]], to whom the earliest version was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marie Moeglin, 'Froissart, le métier d'historien et l'invention de la Guerre de Cent Ans', ''Romania'' 124 (2006), 429-470.&lt;/ref&gt; In the prologue of this version of the prose text, Froissart justified his new enterprise by his desire to improve on his first attempts to write a historical account of the early years of the Hundred Years' War. In particular he denounced his earlier rhyming chronicle, whose accuracy, he admitted, had not always been as good as such important matters as war and knightly prowess require. In order to improve the quality and historical accuracy of his work, Froissart declared his intention to follow now as his main source the ''Vrayes Chroniques'' of [[Jean Le Bel]], who had expressed fierce criticism on verse as a suitable vehicle for serious history writing. Froissart also used other texts, such as the ''Life of the Black Prince'' by [[Chandos Herald]], in particular for the [[Black Prince]]'s campaign in Spain in 1366-1367.&lt;ref&gt;J.J.N. Palmer, 'Book I (1325-78) and its sources', in J.J.N. Palmer (ed.), ''Froissart: Historian'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1981), pp. 7-24; Peter F. Ainsworth, 'Collationnement, montage et ''jeu parti'': le début de la campagne espagnole du Prince Noir (1366-67) dans les ''Chroniques'' de Jean Froissart, ''Le Moyen Âge'', 100 (1994), 369-411.&lt;/ref&gt; He furthermore inserted some official documents into his text, including the act of [[Homage (feudal)|''hommage'']] by [[King Edward III]] to the French King [[Philip VI of Valois|Philip VI]] (1331) and the English version of the [[Treaty of Brétigny|Peace Treaty of Calais]] (1360).
[[File:Pierre leCruel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry II of Castile|Henry II]] kills his predecessor as [[King of Castile and León]], [[Pedro the Cruel]], in an early illustration taken from [http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/browsey.jsp?img0=e&amp;pb0=Bes-1_286v&amp;div0=ms.f.transc.Bes-1&amp;panes=1&amp;disp0=pb Besançon, BM, MS 864] (ca. 1410-1420)]]

Le Bel had written his chronicle for [[John of Beaumont|Jean, lord of Beaumont]], uncle of [[Philippa of Hainault]], who had been a supporter of [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]] and the [[Invasion of England (1326)|rebellion]] which led to the deposition of Edward II in 1326. Jean of Hainault had also taken part in several of the early battles of the [[Hundred Years' War]], first on the English side, then on the French. His grandson, [[Guy II of Blois-Châtillon|Guy II, Count of Blois]] later became the main patron of Froissart's ''Chronicles''. Jean Le Bel himself, throughout his work expressed great admiration for Edward III, in whose 1327 [[Weardale campaign]] against the Scots he had fought. For all these reasons Froissart must have highly valued Le Bel's chronicle as a source for reliable information about the events which led to the outbreak of the war between France and England and about the early phases of the Hundred Years' War. Comparison of Froissart's Book I with Le Bel's work shows that for the early parts of the ''Chronicles'' (up to c.1360) Froissart often directly copied and developed very large parts of Le Bel's text.

Froissart seems to have written new drafts of Book I, which covers the period up to 1378/1379, at different points in time. Several of these variant versions are now known to scholars by the unique manuscripts which have transmitted their texts, such as the 'Amiens' ([http://bvmm.irht.cnrs.fr/sommaire/sommaire.php?reproductionId=18882 Amiens, Bibliothèque municipale, ms. 486]), 'Valenciennes' ([http://patrimoine-numerique.ville-valenciennes.fr/ark:/29755/B_596066101_MS_0638 Valenciennes, Bibliothèque municipale, ms. 638]), and 'Rome' versions of Book I, so named after manuscripts kept in the municipal libraries of Amiens and Valenciennes and in the [[Vatican Library]]. The so-called 'Rome' version of Book I ([https://digi.vatlib.it/view/MSS_Reg.lat.869 Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Reg. Lat. 869]) has only partly survived and now only covers the period up to c.1350. 

The order of the authorial versions of Book I has been discussed extensively by scholars in the last century and a half and there have been many fundamental disagreements.&lt;ref&gt;J.J.N. Palmer, 'Book I (1325-78) and its sources', in J.J.N. Palmer (ed.), ''Froissart: Historian'' (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1981), 7-24; P. Courroux, ''L'écriture de l'histoire dans les chroniques françaises (XIIe-XVe siècle)'' (Paris: Classiques Garnier, 2016), 352-361.&lt;/ref&gt; However, research by Godfried Croenen has now firmly established that the earlier views held mostly by French scholars, following Siméon Luce, the French 19th-century editor of the ''Chronicles'', who thought that the 'Amiens' version was a more recent version that must have followed the 'A' and 'B' versions in the chronology, are no longer tenable.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried Croenen, 'La Guerre en Normandie au XIVe siècle et le problème de l'évolution textuelle des ''Chroniques'' de Jean Froissart', in A. Curry and V. Gazeau (eds.), ''La Guerre en Normandie (XIe-XVe siècle)'' (Caen: Presses Universitaires de Caen, 2018), 111-147, table p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Croenen has established that the so-called 'A' version that Luce had identified, is in fact a hybrid version composed by medieval scribes who put together the very beginning and end of the authorial 'A' version, combining it with a much larger part of the so-called 'B' version, and a fragment of the [[Grandes Chroniques de France]] covering the years 1350-1356. The authorial 'A' version, which is now largely lost except for the fragments from the beginning and end, is the first version of Book I written by Froissart and was probably composed by him between June and December 1381.&lt;ref&gt;Croenen, 'La Guerre en Normandie', p. 118-122, 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Amiens' and 'Valenciennes' versions are both earlier than the so-called 'B' redaction.&lt;ref&gt;George T. Diller (ed.), ''Froissart. Chroniques. Livre I. Le manuscrit d'Amiens. Bibliothèque municipale n° 486'', 5 vols. (Geneva: Droz, 1991-1998); Michael Schwarze, ''Generische Wahrheit - Höfischers Polylog im Werk Jean Froissarts'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner, 2003), p. 209; Jean-Marie Moeglin, 'Froissart, le métier d'historien et l'invention de la Guerre de Cent Ans', ''Romania'' 124 (2006), 429-470.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Amiens' version and the abridgement of Book I ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9061593n/f3.item Paris, BnF, fr. 10144]) were probably both written in the period 1384-1391, but the 'Amiens' version seems the earlier of the two.&lt;ref&gt;G. Croenen, Jean Froissart, Chronicles [Amiens version and abridged version], in M. Livingston and K. DeVries (eds.) ''The Battle of Crécy: A Casebook'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2015), p. 396-397, 400-402; Croenen, 'La Guerre en Normandie', p. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'B' redaction is the version of Book I that was edited by S. Luce for the Société d'Histoire de France and that represents what is often seen as the 'standard' version of Book I.&lt;ref&gt;Siméon Luce (ed.), ''Chroniques de J. Froissart'' [Book I] 8 vols. (Paris: Société de l'histoire de France, 1869-1888).&lt;/ref&gt; Luce himself was convinced that the 'B' version represented the earliest completed state of Book I and that it was therefore earlier than the 'Amiens' text. The evidence from the text, however, argues strongly for a date of composition in or shortly after 1391, so certainly later than the 'Amiens' version, and before 1399.&lt;ref&gt;G. Croenen, Jean Froissart, Chronicles [B/C version], in M. Livingston and K. DeVries (eds.) ''The Battle of Crécy: A Casebook'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2015), p. 407-410; Croenen, 'La Guerre en Normandie', p. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'B' version was followed by the 'C' version of Book I, written sometime between 1395 and 1399, which was long considered lost; the 'C' version actually survives in a single manuscript now in the [[Newberry Library]] in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried Croenen, 'A 'refound' manuscript of Froissart revisited: Newberry MS f.37', ''French Studies Bulletin'', 31 (2010), 56-60; G. Croenen, Jean Froissart, Chronicles [B/C version], in M. Livingston and K. DeVries (eds.) ''The Battle of Crécy: A Casebook'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2015), p. 407-410; Croenen, 'La Guerre en Normandie', p. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Rome' version was written towards the end of Froissart's life, at the earliest in late 1404 and probably sometime before 1415.&lt;ref&gt;George T. Diller, 'La dernière rédaction du premier livre des ''Chroniques'' de Froissart. Une étude du Reg. lat. 869', ''Le Moyen Âge'', 76 (1970), 91-125; Croenen, 'La Guerre en Normandie', p. 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:BNMsFr2643FroissartFol97vBatNevilleCross.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Neville's Cross]], 1346, from the [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Gruuthuse manuscript]].]]

A first version of the second book of Froissart's ''Chronicles'', which in the author's mind never seems to have been a separate book but rather a continuation covering the period 1378-1385, was probably completed in the late 1380s.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ainsworth, 'Froissart and his Second Book', In: Christopher Allmand (ed.), ''War, Government and Power in Late Medieval France'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 2000), pp. 21-36.&lt;/ref&gt; It does not seem to have been based on other pre-existing chronicles and is therefore entirely Froissart's own work.  Book II, however, includes an extended account of the Flemish revolt against the count in the years 1379-1385, which Froissart had earlier composed as a separate text and which is known as his ''Chronicle of Flanders''. Froissart inserted several official documents into his ''Chronicle of Flanders'', which were also kept in Book II of the ''Chronicles'', including the text of [[Peace of Tournai|Treaty of Tournai]] (1385) that re-established peace between the Flemish cities and their count.

As with Book I, Froissart also seems to have rewritten the later books of his ''Chronicles''. Apart from the ''Chronicle of Flanders'', at least three authorial versions of Book II survive. Most manuscripts of Book II contain one of the two earlier versions, which have an almost identical text, except for a small number of chapters in which there are substantial differences. The manuscripts of these two earlier versions have provided the basis for all the modern editions.

There is also a later version of Book II, which dates from after 1395 and survives only in the Newberry manuscript that also contains the 'C' version of Book I.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried Croenen, 'A 'refound' manuscript of Froissart revisited: Newberry MS f.37', ''French Studies Bulletin'', 31 (2010), 56-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The Newberry version of Book II is substantially different from the other known versions and is undoubtedly the result of an extensive authorial reworking of the text, which included the addition of important material that does not appear in the other versions. The Newberry text has not yet been fully edited but it has been partly transcribed for the [http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/onlinefroissart/browsey.jsp?GlobalMode=facsimile&amp;img0=&amp;pb0=Chi-2_1r&amp;GlobalWord=0&amp;div0=ms.f.transc.Chi-2&amp;disp0=pb&amp;GlobalShf=&amp;panes=1&amp;NavDiv0=ms.f.transc.Chi-2&amp;NavBy0=shf&amp;NavPb0=Chi-2_1r&amp;NavMsch0=Chi-2_1&amp;NavShf0=Chi-2_SHF_2C-4&amp;NavGo=Go Online Froissart].

A first version of Book III, which covers the years 1385 to 1390, but which also includes extensive flashback to the earlier periods, was possibly completed in 1390 or 1391 and is the one found in nearly all the surviving manuscripts. A second version exists in a single manuscript ([http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b90605295/f2.item Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS fr. 2650]).&lt;ref&gt;Godfried Croenen, 'La tradition manuscrite du Troisième Livre des ''Chroniques'' de Froissart', in Valérie Fasseur (ed.), ''Froissart à la cour de Béarn: l'écrivain, les arts et le pouvoir'' (Turnhout: Brepols, 2009), pp. 15-59.&lt;/ref&gt; This second version is probably a later reworking by Froissart himself: it follows the pattern that can be seen in the different authorial versions of Book II, with many chapters remaining the same and some chapters having been extensively rewritten.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried Croenen, 'Stemmata, philology and textual history: a response to Alberto Varvaro', ''Medioevo Romanzo'', 34 (2010), 398-402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Book IV, whose text goes up to the year 1400, remains incomplete and was probably, like the 'Rome' version of Book I, written after 1404. It is likely that the abrupt ending of Book IV is to be explained by Froissart's death, which may have occurred while he was writing this part of the ''Chronicles''. 
[[File:Battle of La Roche-Derrien.jpg|thumb|Capture of the Duke of Bretagne at the [[Battle of La Roche-Derrien]], 1347]]

Book IV has been transmitted in 21 manuscripts, all representing a single authorial version.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Varvaro, 'Problèmes philologiques du Livre IV des ''Chronique'' de Jean Froissart', in Godfried Croenen &amp; Peter Ainsworth (eds.), ''Patrons, Authors and Workshops: Books and Book Production in Paris around 1400'' (Leuven: Peeters, 2006), pp. 255-277.&lt;/ref&gt; The text shows traces of having been worked over by a 'copy editor', who was not the author but someone who seems to have prepared a text, possibly autograph, for reproduction. Unlike the other three books of the ''Chronicles'', Book IV seems to have remained unknown for a long time, until it was discovered in the second half of the 15th century, when the first manuscript copies of the text were made and the text started to circulate in the court circles of the [[Dukes of Burgundy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Varvaro, ''La tragédie de l'histoire. La dernière œuvre de Jean Froissart'' (Paris: Classiques Garnier, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illuminated manuscripts==
The ''Chronicles'' were almost immediately popular among the nobility, and many manuscripts were expensively illuminated. In the first quarter of the 15th century many illustrated copies of Book I, as well as some copies of Books II and III, were produced by the Parisian booktrade. Nearly half of these surviving copies can be linked to a particular ''libraire'', called Pierre de Liffol.&lt;ref&gt;Godfried Croenen, Mary Rouse &amp; Richard Rouse, 'Pierre de Liffol and the manuscripts of Froissart’s ''Chronicles'', Viator 33 (2002), 261-293; 'Les Chroniques de Jean Froissart', ''Art de l’enluminure'', 31 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Several artistic hands can be detected in these copies, but two anonymous miniature painters seem to stand out as regular collaborators in Liffol's production: the [[Boethius Master]] and the [[:fr:Maître de Giac|Giac Master]].

There was something of a revival in interest from about 1470 in the Burgundian Low Countries, and some of the most extensive cycles of Flemish illumination were produced to illustrate Froissart's ''Chronicles''. Several complete copies of the four books, as well as all the illustrated manuscripts of Book IV, date from this period.&lt;ref&gt;Laetitia Le Guay, ''Les princes de Bourgogne lecteurs de Froissart. Les rapports entre le texte et l'image dans les manuscrits enluminés du livre IV des Chroniques'' (Turnhout: Brepols, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas older illustrations are mostly rather simple and formulaic, with decorated backgrounds, the larger images of this later period are often full of detail, and have extensive views of landscape, interiors or cities in their backgrounds.  Most of the images here come from this period.  One of the most lavishly illuminated copies was commissioned by [[Louis of Gruuthuse]], a [[Flemings|Flemish]] nobleman, in the 1470s. The four volumes of [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|this copy]] (BnF, Fr 2643-6) contain 110 miniatures painted by some of the best [[Bruges|Brugeois]] artists of the day.  Among them is [[Loiset Lyédet]], who has been identified as the painter who executed the miniatures in the first two volumes. Those in the third and fourth volume have been attributed to a collaboration between the [[Master of Anthony of Burgundy]], the [[Master of the Dresden Prayer Book]] and the [[Master of Margaret of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Hans-Collas &amp; Pascal Schandel, ''Manuscrits enluminés des anciens Pays-Bas méridionaux. I. Manuscrits de Louis de Bruges'' (Paris: Bibliothèque nationale de France, 2009), pp. 272-283.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the illustrations to this entry come from this copy.

A '''gasoline price website''' is a type of [[Price comparison service|price comparison]] [[website]] that provides current fuel price information for different [[filling station]]s. Supported fuel types generally include [[gasoline]], but may also include [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[biofuel]]s and recharge [[electricity]].

The main utility of these websites is that they allow users to find the lowest price of gasoline in their area, since gasoline prices often vary significantly between gas stations in the same neighborhood. In addition to listing prices for particular filling stations, some of sites also show the average cost of gasoline in the area and price trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Traffic Up on Gasoline Price Web Sites |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Technology/Gasoline-price-Web-sites-see-huge-increase-in-visitors/2007/05/25/1179601617918.html |date=2007-05-28 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MapQuest and Gas Buddy Single Out Cheap Gas |url=http://blogs.pcworld.com/tipsandtweaks/archives/003639.html |date=2007-01-30 |work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate=2008-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417225708/http://blogs.pcworld.com/tipsandtweaks/archives/003639.html |archivedate=2008-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial services ==

Many commercial [[website]]s allow registered users or site visitors to update the price information, usually for an incentive such as "points" which are accumulated and displayed alongside a user's name. In some cases, points can be redeemed for rewards, such as an entry in a drawing for a prize, such as [[electric vehicles]] and free fuel cards. Some sites also provide message forums to allow users to engage in discussions about gas prices and money-saving strategies, among other topics.  Fuel prices are sometimes made available via SMS text messaging.

One site, [[Gasbuddy.com]], has different web addresses for different cities in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. The site offers one gasoline gift card every day to contributors.

== Government-sponsored services ==

In [[Western Australia]], the [[FuelWatch]] concept is a free service, backed by Government legislation. The system was considered for implementation nationwide, but was  met with some controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,23780491-662,00.html | work=Herald Sun | title=Leak of dissent tops up the controversy | first=Peter | last=Jean | date=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FuelWatch concept requires all fuel retailers in Perth, and approximately 80% of those within the state but outside of the state capital area, to notify their "tomorrow prices" by 2pm each day. Prices are changed at 6am each morning, and must be held for 24 hours. Each afternoon, the prices for the next day are released to the public and the media, allowing consumers to make an informed decision whether to fill up today or tomorrow, safe in the knowledge that prices cannot change.

'''iD''' is a [[free software]] online editor for [[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM) [[geodata]] created in [[JavaScript]] and released in 2013. It is designed to be simple and [[user friendly]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2013/05/07/openstreetmap-launches-all-new-easy-map-editor-and-announces-funding-appeal/ | title=OpenStreetMap launches all-new easy map editor and announces funding appeal | publisher=OpenStreetMap blog | date=7 May 2013 | accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is used as a default editor on main OSM page.

== Usage ==
It's the most popular OSM editor by number of users.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editor_usage_stats#by_number_of_users_.28distinct_uids.29&lt;/ref&gt;

iD's features include choosing custom aerial imagery and native support for [[Mapillary]] photos.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Comparison_of_editors#iD&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Prior to iD, the primary web editor for OpenStreetMap data was the Flash-based Potlatch 2 editor.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Comparison_of_editors&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2009/11/30/introducing-a-new-osm-editor-potlatch-2/&lt;/ref&gt;. The iD editor project was founded by the author of Potlatch 1 and 2, Richard Fairhurst, online on July 13, 2012&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2012/07/13/building-a-friendly-editor-for-openstreetmap/&lt;/ref&gt; and at the State of the Map conference on October 14, 2012.&lt;ref name="starts-with-editor"/&gt;

In September 2012, the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation|Knight Foundation]] announced the winners of the Knight News Challenge: Data competition. The team from Development Seed/Mapbox was selected as a winner for their proposal to develop new contribution tools for OpenStreetMap, and awarded a grant of $575,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knightfoundation.org/press/releases/six-ventures-bring-data-public-winners-knight-news&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://blog.mapbox.com/large-investment-in-openstreetmap-from-knight-foundation-cf7aa00534db&lt;/ref&gt; With this investment in hand, Mapbox collaborated with Richard Fairhurst to work on iD.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mapbox.com/osmdev/2012/10/25/diving-into-id/&lt;/ref&gt; The initial release of iD, labeled "Alpha0", came out shortly thereafter on December 22, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mapbox.com/osmdev/2012/12/22/alpha0/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The choice of ''iD'' as a name is related to popularity of ''getElementById'' in JavaScript, combination of ''[[iPad|'''i'''Pad]]'' with ''[[System D|Système '''D''']]'', and a tribute to the ''[[Citroën DS#Name|Citroen iD]]'' car model. It was also meant to be easier to spell than ''Potlatch''.&lt;ref name="starts-with-editor"/&gt;

== Technical background ==
This editor was meant to be a [[Potlatch (software)|Potlatch 2]] architecture reimplementation in JavaScript with redesigned user interface. The (only) big internal change was departure from [[XML]] tagging preset architecture to a [[JSON]]-based one.&lt;ref name="starts-with-editor"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20121023145335/http://www.systemed.net/blog/index.php?post=24&lt;/ref&gt;

While the initial versions were based on [[Dojo Toolkit|Dojo]] framework,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mapbox.com/osmdev/2012/10/25/diving-into-id/&lt;/ref&gt; iD now uses [[D3.js]] library for rendering and its primary mode of rendering is via [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]]. Its core architecture is modular and designed to be easily used in other JavaScript-based tools for OpenStreetMap.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intute''' was a free Web service aimed at students, teachers, and researchers in UK [[further education]] and [[higher education]]. Intute provided access to online resources, via a large [[database]] of resources. Each resource was reviewed by an academic specialist in the subject, who wrote a short review of between 100 and 200 words, and described via various [[metadata]] fields (such as which subject discipline(s) it would be useful to) what type of resource it was, who created it, who its intended audience was, what time-period or geographical area the resource covered, and so on. As of July 2010, Intute provided 123,519 records. Funding was stopped in 2011, and the site closed.

A partial archive of the Intute library is maintained at [https://xtlearn.net/Intute XtLearn.net]

== History of Intute ==
Intute was formed in July 2006 after the merger of the eight semi-autonomous "hubs" that formed the '''Resource Discovery Network (RDN)'''. These hubs each served particular academic disciplines:

* Altis - Hospitality, leisure, sport and tourism
* Artifact - Arts and creative industries
* Biome - Health and life sciences
* [[Edinburgh Engineering Virtual Library|EEVL - Engineering, mathematics, and computing]]
* GEsource - Geography and the environment
* [[Humbul]] - Humanities
* PSIgate - Physical sciences
* SOSIG - Social sciences

The restructuring and rebranding was undertaken to create a service with a more uniform identity and appearance, better cross-searching facilities, and more focused technical and management teams. As part of the restructuring, the eight RDN hubs were initially reorganised into four subject groups. This process also incorporated the [http://www.vtstutorials.co.uk/ Virtual Training Suite ], a series of continually updated, free online Internet training tutorials for over 65 subject areas.

The Intute service was geographically distributed, with staff based at several UK universities.

* [[University of Birmingham]]
* [[University of Bristol]]
* [[Heriot-Watt University]]
* [[University of Manchester]]
* [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]
* [[University of Nottingham]]
* [[University of Oxford]]

In July 2010, funding for Intute was significantly reduced and the Consortium was disbanded. Intute was then maintained by [[Mimas (data centre)|Mimas]] at the [[University of Manchester]], and the Virtual Training Suite was maintained and developed by the Institute for Learning and Research Technology (ILRT) at the [[University of Bristol]].

The Intute.ac.uk service ended July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jisc.ac.uk/website/legacy/intute|website=Jisc.ac.uk|title=Intute Archive|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Social bookmarking#Education|educational social bookmarking]] service [https://xtlearn.net XtLearn.net] now maintains an unofficial [https://xtlearn.net/Intute archive of the majority of the Intute content set].

== Funding ==
Intute was funded by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] (JISC). Some of the subject groups received funding from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC) and the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).  The [[Wellcome Trust]] was a partner of Intute: Health and Life Sciences and contributed content to this section.

In 2010, funding from [[Jisc]] was significantly reduced, and ceased in August 2011.  In July of that year Intute stopped  updating and actively maintaining the site.  It remained available on the Internet without maintenance for three years beyond that. Intute looked for ways to fold its content into some other service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/faq.html|website=Intute.ac.uk|accessdate=15 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107000210/http://www.intute.ac.uk/faq.html|archivedate=7 November 2014|title=Intute FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; but none were found.

== Functionality ==
Intute's online database could be searched or browsed using a standard Web browser. The database contained 123,519 records (July 2010). Old records were reviewed regularly by subject experts to ensure that information was as current as possible. The advanced search engine enabled users to search the database by keyword, subject, or resource type, whilst the browse structure enabled time period and resource type filtering, as well as the ability to restrict searches to within particular browse headings.

The Intute Integration tools enabled users to customise and export Intute content to their own web pages or [[Virtual learning environment|VLEs]].  This included [[RSS|newsfeeds]], an embedded search box and MyIntute (where users could save Intute content in their own online space, tag and export it). Machine-readable interfaces to the database were available using the [[Z39.50]], [[Search/Retrieve Web Service]] and [[Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting|OAI-PMH]] protocols.

== Awards ==
Intute was awarded the 2007 [[Jason Farradane Award]] in recognition of its outstanding work in the field of [[information science]]. The award was made on behalf of the UK eInformation Group ([[UKeiG]]), part of the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]] (CILIP). It is sponsored by the ''Journal of Information Science'', published by [[SAGE Publications]].

'''Kabouter Wesley''' (English: '''Gnome Wesley''') is a series of [[comics]] and short [[animated cartoon]]s about a grumpy and violent [[kabouter]] ([[gnome]]), made by [[Jonas Geirnaert]]. Both the drawing style and the content are purposely made naive and amateuristic and the situations are [[Surrealism|surreal]] and [[violent]]. There is also a lot of insulting and [[toilet humour]] in the series.

==Concept==

Wesley is a [[gnome]] wearing a red hat and suit. He is typically cranky and short-tempered. He often has surreal adventures which are told in one-page [[gag-a-day]] stories, where he encounters various people, other gnomes and anthropomorphic characters who either confuse him and/or annoy him. As a result, he often gets angry and violent. Both the comic strip as well as the animated TV spin-off are drawn in a simple, naïve style.

==History==
[[File:Jonas Geirnaert.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Jonas Geirnaert]]]]

Geirnaert invented Wesley the Gnome while creating his [[Short film|short animation film]] ''[[Flatlife]]'' (winner of the jury prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]) in 2004. As this film required him to be very perfectionistic and thorough, he drew Wesley the Gnome as a side project and intentionally spent no time on good graphics, interesting plotlines or other recurring characters. In 2008 the comics were published in the magazine [[HUMO]]. Despite their popularity Geirnaert decided to terminate the series after only 27 episodes. In the autumn of 2009 Wesley the Gnome was granted new life through a series of animated shorts, broadcast once a week in the [[human interest]] TV series ''[[Man Bijt Hond]]''. Originally all the shorts were based on the comics Geirnaert drew earlier, but as this material ran short he created several more episodes, which were once again pre-published in Humo. When the TV episodes were uploaded on [[YouTube]] as well the cartoons gained an even broader audience, especially in [[The Netherlands]]. Due to the [[cult following|cult appeal]] Geirnaert appeared in several Flemish and Dutch media.

Geirnaert provides Wesley's voice in all the cartoons, typically after roughing up his vocal cords in warming-up sessions. His [[Jelle De Beule]], who also collaborates with him in their comedy group [[Neveneffecten (cabaret)|Neveneffecten]], does the other voices. The animation is made by the Volstok Telefunken studios. The background music is [[Hammond organ]] music by [[Klaus Wunderlich]]. Other numbers used include ''La Felicidad'' from the album ''The Golden Sound of Hammond (aka Hammond Für Millionen)'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weK3oBiCK8E Klaus Wunderlich - La felicidad], muziek van Kabouter Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hasta La Vista'', from the album ''Hammond Pops 10''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOKnfBjVSfo Klaus Wunderlich - Hasta la vista], muziek van Kabouter Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; and the single ''Tico Tico''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgcLbkK1i4k Klaus Wunderlich - Tico Tico], muziek van Kabouter Wesley&lt;/ref&gt; Besides of Klaus Wunderlich's music, also ''Coconut'' from [[Electronic System|The Electronic System]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--eXBteWEyg The Electronic System - Coconut]&lt;/ref&gt; was used.

The comics and cartoons quickly became popular with audiences, albeit somewhat polarizing with others who didn't enjoy the intentional silliness and vulgarity. In 2010 a radio commercial for [[Humo]], where Geirnaert provided the voice of Wesley caused controversy due to a joke where Wesley threatens some children with sending them to a "special education" school if they don't obey him. Pedagogues and teachers from schools for mentally challenged children felt the joke was offensive and stigmatized them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4teensonline.be/Pub/4teensonline/4teens_new-Nieuwsartikels/Life/Kabouter-Wesley-beledigt-buitengewoon-onderwijs.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taalblad.be/e-zine/kort-en-klein/kaftpapier-kabouter-wesley-veroorzaakt-fikse-ruzie/659.html&lt;/ref&gt; Wesley was soon used in all kinds of merchandising, including on the [[streetcar]]s who drive to the Belgian coast.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gva.be/cnt/aid954452/kabouter-wesley-prijkt-op-nieuwe-kusttram&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[video game]] spin-off was also created, in collaboration with Geirnaert.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.creativeskills.be/user/bramvd/het-kabouter-wesley-computerspel/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Geirnaert once again terminated his series because he ran out of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/948/Kunst-Literatuur/article/detail/1152911/2010/09/03/Kabouter-Wesley-The-end.dhtml&lt;/ref&gt; The same year a huge comic book collecting all the ''Kabouter Wesley'' cartoons was published by Borgerhoff &amp; Lamberigts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.borgerhoff-lamberigts.be/boeken/p/detail/het-kleine-kabouter-wesley-boek&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stripweb.be/S-stripverhaal-het-grote-kabouter-wesley-boek-bestellen-11977.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It was later also released in a smaller format.&lt;ref&gt;http://stripgids.org/2011/09/het-grote-kabouter-wesley-boek-nu-ook-in-het-klein/&lt;/ref&gt; The animated shorts are not available on video, though they have been collected on video as a one-shot gift with one 2010 issue of [[Humo]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humo.be/extras-bij-humo/28814/deze-week-bij-humo-alle-filmpjes-van-kabouter-wesley&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3179">'''Lawrence Fitzroy Powell''' (9 August 1881, [[Oxford]] – 17 July 1975, [[Banbury]]) was an English literary scholar.

The son of [http://chargeofthelightbrigade.com/allmen/allmenP/allmenP_13LD/powell_h_1228_13LD.html Harry Powell (1830–1886)], a trumpeter who had been wounded in the [[Charge of the Light Brigade]], Powell was educated at a London board school before working in [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose College]]'s library from 1893-95. He then worked for the [[Bodleian Library]] under [[E. W. B. Nicholson]] from 1895 until in 1901 when he joined the group of scholars working on the ''[[New English Dictionary]]'' under [[William Craigie]]. Powell married Ethelwyn Rebecca (1873/4−1941) on 31 July 1909; they had one son. Upon the outbreak of the [[World War I|Great War]] in 1914, Powell was declared unfit for active service but he joined the [[Admiralty]] two years later.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;J. D. Fleeman, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37861 Powell, Lawrence Fitzroy  (1881–1975)]’, rev. ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 26 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell was appointed librarian of the [[Taylor Institution]] in 1921, a post he held until 1949. He was awarded honorary fellowships at both [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]] and [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]] in 1966 and was awarded an Oxford [[Doctor of Letters]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Boswell's ''Life of Johnson''==

Powell was interested in fellow [[lexicography|lexicographer]] [[Samuel Johnson]]. Johnsonian scholar [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R. W. Chapman]] asked Powell to revise [[George Birkbeck Hill]]'s edition of [[James Boswell]]'s ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' in 1923. His revised edition was published in 1934 in four volumes and "thereafter, as for Johnson, the title was inseparable from his name".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; A fifth volume consisted of his edition of Boswell's ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' after Boswell papers were discovered at [[Malahide Castle]] and [[Fettercairn]] House. The sixth volume was the index.

[[Durham University]] awarded Powell a Doctor of Letters in 1935 on the strength of his work on Boswell. Right up until his death, Powell continued research for an updated edition of the ''Life of Johnson''. [[J. D. Fleeman]] claimed that "his ''Boswell'' is a lasting memorial".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

'''Lefax''' was a [[company (law)|company]] founded in 1910 by J. C. Parker in Philadelphia that produced a range of [[personal organiser]]s.&lt;ref name="kipnotes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kipnotes.com/Office%20Equipment.htm|title=Office Equipment - Business History of Manufacturers|publisher=kipnotes.com|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about-filofax"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filofax.co.uk/about-filofax | title=A Brief History | publisher=[[Filofax]] | work=About Filofax | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early days, the biggest customers were power plant engineers whose technical handbooks had grown too big to carry.&lt;ref name="NYTOrganizing"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/08/business/organizing-pays-off-at-filofax.html|title=Organizing Pays Off At Filofax|last=Lohr|first=Steve|date=1987-04-08|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, a London printer and stationery marketer, Norman &amp; Hill Ltd., began importing the organizers, called Lefaxes. Several years later, they began to make the personal files under their [[Filofax]] brand.&lt;ref name="NYTOrganizing"/&gt;

The Lefax trademark was registered 5 October 1926.&lt;ref name="kipnotes"/&gt; Its use in the engineering industries was so pervasive that some journals were published in Lefax format.&lt;ref name="JAOCS"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1947|title=Meet Your Past President...  J. J. VOLLERTSEN, 1925|journal=Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin / Heidelberg|volume=24|issue=3|pages=A18|issn=0003-021X|doi=10.1007/BF02632363|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x43681652411m7xp/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Lefax was bought out by London Wood Partners, a British firm,&lt;ref name="NYTOrganizing"/&gt; and in 1992 the company was acquired by its rival, [[Filofax]]. The original intention was that Lefax would be Filofax's top of the line range&lt;ref name="NYTForaging"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/03/style/foraging-the-high-art-of-organizing-your-life.html|title=FORAGING; The High Art of Organizing Your Life|last=Greenberg|first=Cara|date=1993-01-03|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Lefax brand was eventually phased out.

The '''Malone Society''' is a British-based [[Text publication society|text publication]] and general [[Learned society|scholarly society]] devoted to the study of 16th- and early 17th-century drama. It publishes editions of plays from manuscript, facsimile editions of printed and manuscript plays of the period, and editions of original documents relating to English theatre and drama before 1642. It also arranges conferences and provides fellowships and research grants.

==History==
The society was founded in 1906 on the initiative of [[Alfred W. Pollard]], who stated that "every generation will need to make its own critical editions to suit its own critical taste, but that work of permanent utility can be done by placing in the hands of students at large such reproductions of the original textual authorities as may make constant and continuous reference to those originals themselves unnecessary."{{sfn|About the Malone Society|n.d.}} The chosen name commemorates [[Edmond Malone]] (1741–1812), the editor of the first [[variorum]] edition of [[Shakespeare]].{{sfn|Ashley|2014|pp=317–318}} 

The inaugural meeting was held on 30 July 1906 at [[University College London]].{{sfn|About the Malone Society|n.d.}} It was attended by [[Frederick S. Boas]], [[E. K. Chambers]], [[T. Gregory Foster]], [[Walter Wilson Greg]], [[Ronald B. McKerrow]], and Pollard.{{sfn|Ashley|2014|pp=317–318}} They agreed that a need existed for the reliable transmission of early modern play texts for scholars and students.{{sfn|Ashley|2014|pp=317–318}} Therefore they resolved, "that a Society, to be called The Malone Society, be formed for the purpose of producing accurate copies of the best editions of early plays."{{sfn|About the Malone Society|n.d.}}

Membership of the society had always been by formal nomination, and for many years the number was restricted to 250. Following the relaxation of these rules, membership became increasingly international, and local chapters have been established in the United States, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia. Members are entitled to a copy of an edited volume published every year by the Society.{{sfn|About the Malone Society|n.d.}}

The Society is a registered charity in the United Kingdom and its administrative base is at the [[University of London|University of London's]] [[Institute of English Studies]].

The '''Menshikov Palace''' ({{lang-ru|Меншиковский дворец}}) is a [[Petrine Baroque]] edifice in [[Saint Petersburg]], situated on [[Universitetskaya Embankment]] of the [[Bolshaya Neva]] on [[Vasilyevsky Island]].&lt;ref&gt;It is not to be confused with the Menshikov Palace in [[Oranienbaum, Russia]], built by the same architects around the same time. ''Menshikov Palace'' can also refer to the Lefort Palace in [[Moscow]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first stone building in the city. Since 1981, it has served as a public museum, a branch of the [[Hermitage Museum]].

The palace was founded in 1710 as a residence of [[Saint Petersburg Governor General]] [[Alexander Danilovich Menshikov|Alexander Menshikov]] and built by Italian architects [[Giovanni Maria Fontana]], and, later, German architect [[Gottfried Johann Schädel]]. It was opened in 1711, but the construction continued until 1727 (assisted by [[Domenico Trezzini]], [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], [[Georg Johann Mattarnovy]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Le Blond]]), when Menshikov with his family was exiled to Siberia and his property was confiscated.

In 1731, [[Cadet Corps (Russia)|Cadet Corps]] were established and occupied the palace and neighboring buildings. At the end of the 19th century the Menshikov Palace was restored and became the museum of the Corps. In 1924, its collections were moved to the Hermitage and other museums. From 1956-1981 the Menshikov Palace was restored again and finally opened to the public as a branch of the Hermitage Museum with a collection of Russian art of the late 17th-early 18th century.

In '''''Mnyungula v Minister of Safety and Security''''' is an important case in [[South Africa|South African]] [[Criminal procedure in South Africa|criminal procedure]]. Mnyungula sought an order for the return of his [[motor vehicle]], which had been seized, without a warrant, by the third respondent, a police [[sergeant]].

He brought the application on the basis that the seizure had been unlawful, in that the sergeant had not had reasonable grounds for believing that the vehicle had been stolen; in fact, his belief had been incorrect. Mnyungula had purchased the vehicle lawfully.

The seizure was purportedly effected in terms of sections 20 and 22 of the CPA.

The [[court]] held that, in interpreting ss 20 and 22, the [[Legal burden of proof|onus]] was on the police to prove, objectively, the existence of ample facts upon which, at the time of their acting without a warrant, they based their reasonable belief "that the article was concerned in the commission or suspected commission of an offense."

The court further held that the sergeant had known, at the time that he formed his alleged "reasonable belief," that the information regarding the previous owner of the vehicle, which had been furnished to him by Mnyungula before the sergeant had formed his alleged belief, had not been checked. He had thus acted recklessly and in a most unreasonable manner.

Objectively viewed, therefore, the sergeant had not had, and could not have formed, a "reasonable belief" on the information that had been at hand at the time of the seizure. The seizure of the vehicle had therefore been irregular.

The court noted that the existence of such a "reasonable belief" could be rebutted by the person whose article had been seized by showing that the "facts" or "grounds" relied upon by the policeman, in forming his reasonable belief, had not existed or had been false. In terms of its inherent powers, the court could then set aside the seizure in the interests of justice, and order that the seized article be returned to the owner of such article.

The court also noted that the [[evidence]] against the applicant was very flimsy. He would likely not be successfully [[Prosecution|prosecuted]]. The vehicle should therefore be returned to him unconditionally.

The seizure of Mnyungula's motor vehicle was set aside and the respondents ordered to return the vehicle to him immediately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3995">A '''mobile social address book''' is a [[phonebook]] on a [[mobile device]] that enables [[subscribers]] to build and grow their [[social networks]]. The mobile social address book transforms the phone book on any standard mobile phone into a social networking platform that makes it easier for subscribers to exchange contact information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wirelessweek.com/article.aspx?id=163626 Wireless Week, retrieved 2008-12-29]&lt;/ref&gt; The mobile social address book is the convergence of [[personal information management]] (PIM) and social networking on a mobile device. While standard mobile phonebooks force users to manually enter contacts, mobile social address books automate this process by enabling subscribers to exchange contact information following a call or SMS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9115165 Computerworld, retrieved 2008-11-5]&lt;/ref&gt; The contact information exchange occurs instantaneously and the user’s phonebook updates automatically. Mobile social address books also provide dynamic updates of contacts if their numbers change over time.

== History ==
Mobile social address books began appearing in 2007 as a parallel social trend to the emergence of Internet-based social networking sites like [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]] and [[LinkedIn]], establishing a new paradigm for interpersonal contact and communication. Mobile social address books sought to bring the connectivity of social networking to the in-the-moment experience of the mobile phone. Users can easily exchange contact information regardless of their handset, mobile carrier, or social networking application they use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latestgeeknews.blogspot.com/2008/02/social-address-booknext-killer-app-part.html Latest Geek News, retrieved 2008-11-5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of emerging companies providing technology to support mobile social address books include: [[PicDial]] (which dynamically augments the existing address book with pictures and status from Facebook, MySpace and Twitter, integrates with the call screen so during every call you see the latest picture and status of whoever is calling.  It is a network address book so everything can be managed from Windows or Mac as well and lastly you can also set your one callerID picture and status for your friends to see when you call them) FusionOne (whose backup and synchronization solutions lets users easily transfer and update mobile content, including contact information, among different devices); [[Loopt]] (whose Loopt service provides a social compass alerting users when friends are near); OnePIN (whose CallerXchange person-to-person contact exchange service lets users share contact info with one click on the mobile phone); and VoxMobili (whose Phone Backup and Synchronized Address Book solutions let users safeguard and synchronize their contact information among different devices).

In 2007, the [[Rich Communication Services]] communication protocol was formed. RCS combines different services defined by [[3GPP]] and [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA) with an enhanced phonebook with broad implications for the mobile social address book. In a February 2017 Wired Magazine [https://www.wired.com/2017/02/google-support-for-rcs/ article], RCS was quoted as "...infected with bureaucracy, complexity, and irrelevance," by industry analyst Dean Bubley in 2015, calling RCS a zombie: dead, but somehow still ambling around. The same active goes on to say: "Google sees it differently. For the company with seemingly thousands of messaging platforms, each one with different features and different audiences, RCS presents an opportunity."

'''''Mochizuki v. United States''''' 43 Fed. Cl. 97 (1999) was a class action lawsuit brought by survivors of Japanese Latin Americans interned during [[World War II]] by the [[United States]] government. The lawsuit alleged forcible kidnapping and imprisonment. In a settlement, the government conceded it erred and allocated $5,000 each for survivor, as well as a formal apology from then-President [[William Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XATQto7K7PUC "World War II"], Carl J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1846">The '''Musée de la Publicité''' was a museum of [[advertising]] history located in the [[Louvre]]'s Rohan and Marsan wings, [[1st arrondissement of Paris]], at 107, rue de Rivoli, [[Paris]], [[France]]. 

The museum first opened in 1978 as the Musée de l’Affiche, and is now a department of the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections|url=http://www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/en/about-us/collections/|publisher=Musée des Arts Décoratifs|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works from the former museum are regularly displayed in temporary exhibitions.

==Collections==
The museum focused on advertisements. It contained about 50,000 [[poster]]s dating between the 18th century and World War II, with a further 50,000 posters dating from the 1950s to the present, over 20,000 [[film]] [[advertisement]]s, more than 30,000 [[newspaper]] and [[magazine]] advertisements, as well as radio advertisements and promotional items.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1831">In '''''Mutual Construction Co v Komati Dam Joint Venture''''', an important case in South African law, Mutual Construction leased a truck, together with an operator, to Komati Dam Joint Venture (KDJV). The agreement required KDJV to provide responsible supervision for the operator; it also provided that KDJV would be responsible for loss or damage to the truck occurring through KDJV's negligence, misdirection or misuse.

While operating the truck onsite, under the control of KDJV, the operator fell asleep and had an accident. Mutual Construction sued KDJV for the cost of repairing the truck and for loss of income due to the truck's being unusable until repaired.

The High Court held that KDJV was not liable, as it had offered the operator an opportunity to rest, of which he had failed to take advantage. It was held, therefore, that the operator's negligence was beyond the control of KDJV.

On appeal, the Supreme Court of Appeal restated common-law rule that a lessee must restore leased property in the condition in which it was received, fair wear and tear excluded. All Mutual Construction had to prove, therefore, was that the article was in a damaged state when returned; it would then be for the hirer of the article, KDJV, to show that damage to the article was due to no negligence on its part. Accordingly, KDJV was found to be liable to Mutual Construction.

No reference was made in this case to the National Credit Act, so this situation, and situations like it, may be taken still to be governed by the common law.

Users no longer need to worry of repercussions of violations of copyright law or stolen information when using an Open Database License.

==Freedoms==
* To Share: To copy, distribute and use the database.

==Conditions==

* Attribute: You must attribute any public use of the database, or works produced from the database, in the manner specified in the ODbL. For any use or redistribution of the database, or works produced from it, you must make clear to others the license of the database and keep intact any notices on the original database.
* Share-Alike: If you publicly use any adapted version of this database, or works produced from an adapted database, you must also offer that adapted database under the ODbL.
* Keep open: If you redistribute the database, or an adapted version of it, then you may use technological measures that restrict the work (such as DRM) as long as you also redistribute a version without such measures.

They are headed by the secretary to the delegates, who serves as OUP's chief executive and as its major representative on other university bodies. Oxford University has used a similar system to oversee OUP since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Carter p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; The Press is located on [[Walton Street]], opposite [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], in the suburb [[Jericho, Oxford|Jericho]].

The university became involved in the print trade around 1480, and grew into a major printer of Bibles, prayer books, and scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, passim&lt;/ref&gt; OUP took on the project that became the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in the late 19th century, and expanded to meet the ever-rising costs of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Sutcliffe, ''The Oxford University Press: an informal history'' (Oxford 1975; re-issued with corrections 2002) pp. 53, 96–97, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the last hundred years has seen Oxford publish children's books, school text books, music, journals, the World's Classics series, and a range of English language teaching texts. Moves into international markets led to OUP opening its own offices outside the [[United Kingdom]], beginning with [[New York City]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, passim&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of computer technology and increasingly harsh trading conditions, the Press's printing house at Oxford was closed in 1989, and its former paper mill at [[Wolvercote]] was demolished in 2004. By contracting out its printing and binding operations, the modern OUP publishes some 6,000 new titles around the world each year.

OUP was first exempted from [[Corporate tax in the United States|United States corporation tax]] in 1972 and from [[United Kingdom corporation tax]] in 1978. As a department of a [[Charitable organization|charity]], OUP is exempt from income tax and corporate tax in most countries, but may pay sales and other commercial taxes on its products. The OUP today transfers 30% of its annual surplus to the rest of the university, with a commitment to a minimum transfer of £12 million per annum. OUP is the largest [[university press]] in the world by the number of publications, publishing more than 6,000 new books every year and employing nearly 6,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://global.oup.com/about/way_we_work/ |title=The Way We Work |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=27 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; OUP publishes many reference, professional, and academic works including the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the [[Oxford World's Classics]], the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', and the ''[[Concise Dictionary of National Biography]]''. A number of its most important titles are now available electronically in a package called "Oxford Reference Online", and are offered free to holders of a reader's card or other subscribing institutions (e.g. universities, colleges, etc.) worldwide.

Books published by Oxford have [[International Standard Book Number]]s that begin with 0–19, making the Press one of a tiny number of publishers who have two-digit identification numbers in the ISBN system. By internal agreement, the first digit of the individual edition number (following 0–19–) can indicate a particular originating division, for example: 3 for music (before [[International Standard Music Number|ISMNs]] were defined); 5 for the New York office; 8 for Clarendon Press publications.

==Museum==
The Oxford University Press Museum is located on [[Great Clarendon Street]], [[Oxford]]. Visits must be booked in advance and are led by a member of the archive staff. Displays include a 19th-century [[printing press]], the OUP buildings, and the printing and history of the ''[[Oxford Almanack]]'', ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

==Early history==
The first printer associated with Oxford University was [[Theoderic Rood]]. A business associate of [[William Caxton]], Rood seems to have brought his own wooden printing press to Oxford from [[Cologne]] as a speculative venture, and to have worked in the city between around 1480 and 1483. The first book printed in Oxford, in 1478,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22355340 |title=Company Overview of Oxford University Press Ltd. |work=Investing.businessweek.com |accessdate=25 September 2012 |archivedate=7 May 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507085055/http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22355340}}&lt;/ref&gt; an edition of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s ''Expositio in symbolum apostolorum'', was printed by another, anonymous, printer. Famously, this was mis-dated in Roman numerals as "1468", thus apparently pre-dating Caxton. Rood's printing included John Ankywyll's ''Compendium totius grammaticae,'' which set new standards for teaching of [[Latin]] [[grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 4; Carter pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rood, printing connected with the university remained sporadic for over half a century. Records or surviving work are few, and Oxford did not put its printing on a firm footing until the 1580s; this succeeded the efforts of [[Cambridge University]], which had obtained a licence for its press in 1534. In response to constraints on printing outside [[London]] imposed by [[the Crown]] and the [[Stationers' Company]], Oxford petitioned [[Elizabeth I of England]] for the formal right to operate a press at the university. The [[chancellor]], [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]], pleaded Oxford's case. Some royal assent was obtained, since the printer [[Joseph Barnes (printer)|Joseph Barnes]] began work, and a decree of [[Star Chamber]] noted the legal existence of a press at "the universitie of Oxforde" in 1586.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 17–22&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century: William Laud and John Fell==

Oxford's chancellor, [[Archbishop]] [[William Laud]], consolidated the legal status of the university's printing in the 1630s. Laud envisaged a unified press of world repute. Oxford would establish it on university property, govern its operations, employ its staff, determine its printed work, and benefit from its proceeds. To that end, he petitioned [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] for rights that would enable Oxford to compete with the Stationers' Company and the [[King's Printer]], and obtained a succession of royal grants to aid it. These were brought together in Oxford's "Great Charter" in 1636, which gave the university the right to print "all manner of books".{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Laud also obtained the "privilege" from the Crown of printing the [[Authorized King James Version|King James]] or [[Authorized Version]] of [[Scripture]] at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This "privilege" created substantial returns in the next 250 years, although initially it was held in abeyance. The Stationers' Company was deeply alarmed by the threat to its trade and lost little time in establishing a "Covenant of Forbearance" with Oxford. Under this, the Stationers paid an annual rent for the university not to exercise its full printing rights&amp;nbsp;– money Oxford used to purchase new printing equipment for smaller purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Laud also made progress with internal organization of the Press. Besides establishing the system of Delegates, he created the wide-ranging supervisory post of "Architypographus": an academic who would have responsibility for every function of the business, from print shop management to [[proofreading]]. The post was more an ideal than a workable reality, but it survived (mostly as a [[sinecure]]) in the loosely structured Press until the 18th century. In practice, Oxford's [[Warehouse]]-Keeper dealt with sales, accounting, and the hiring and firing of print shop staff.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 31, 65&lt;/ref&gt;

Laud's plans, however, hit terrible obstacles, both personal and political. Falling foul of political intrigue, he was executed in 1645, by which time the [[English Civil War]] had broken out. Oxford became a [[Royalist]] stronghold during the conflict, and many printers in the city concentrated on producing political pamphlets or sermons. Some outstanding mathematical and [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] works emerged at this time—notably, texts edited by [[Edward Pococke]], the [[Regius Professor]] of [[Hebrew]]—but no university press on Laud's model was possible before the [[English Restoration|Restoration of the Monarchy]] in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxford University Press Museum (31175477990).jpg|thumb|Matrices for casting type collected by Bishop Fell, part of his collection now known as the "Fell Types", shown in the OUP Museum.]]
It was finally established by the [[vice-chancellor]], [[John Fell (bishop)|John Fell]], [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], [[Bishop]] of Oxford, and Secretary to the Delegates. Fell regarded Laud as a [[martyr]], and was determined to honour his vision of the Press. Using the provisions of the Great Charter, Fell persuaded Oxford to refuse any further payments from the Stationers and drew all printers working for the university onto one set of premises. This business was set up in the cellars of the new [[Sheldonian Theatre]], where Fell installed printing presses in 1668, making it the university's first central print shop.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt; A type foundry was added when Fell acquired a large stock of typographical [[Punchcutting|punches]] and matrices from the [[Dutch Republic]]—the so-called "[[History of Western typography#Fell types|Fell Types]]". He also induced two Dutch typefounders, Harman Harmanz and Peter de Walpergen, to work in Oxford for the Press.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 56–58, 122–27&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, defying the Stationers' demands, Fell personally leased the right to print from the university in 1672, in partnership with Thomas Yate, Principal of [[Brasenose]], and [[Sir Leoline Jenkins]], Principal of [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Fell's scheme was ambitious. Besides plans for academic and religious works, in 1674 he began to print a [[broadsheet]] calendar, known as the ''Oxford Almanack''. Early editions featured symbolic views of Oxford, but in 1766 these gave way to realistic studies of the city or university.&lt;ref&gt;Helen M. Petter, ''The Oxford Almanacks'' (Oxford, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Almanacks'' have been produced annually without interruption from Fell's time to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the start of this work, Fell drew up the first formal programme for the university's printing. Dating from 1675, this document envisaged hundreds of works, including the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]], editions of the [[Coptic Gospels]] and works of the [[Church Fathers]], texts in [[Arabic]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]], comprehensive editions of [[classical philosophy]], poetry, and mathematics, a wide range of [[medieval]] scholarship, and also "a history of [[insects]], more perfect than any yet Extant."&lt;ref&gt;Carter p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Though few of these proposed titles appeared during Fell's life, bible printing remained at the forefront of his mind. A full variant Greek text of [[Scripture]] proved impossible, but in 1675 Oxford printed a [[quarto]] King James edition, carrying Fell's own textual changes and spellings. This work only provoked further conflict with the Stationers' Company. In retaliation, Fell leased the university's bible printing to three rogue Stationers, [[Moses Pitt]], Peter Parker, and [[Thomas Guy]], whose sharp commercial instincts proved vital to fomenting Oxford's bible trade.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Their involvement, however, led to a protracted legal battle between Oxford and the Stationers, and the litigation dragged on for the rest of Fell's life. He died in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;Carter ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century: Clarendon Building and Blackstone==
Yate and Jenkins predeceased Fell, leaving him with no obvious heir to oversee the print shop. As a result, his will left the partners' stock and lease in trust to Oxford University, and charged them with keeping together "my founding Materialls of the Press."&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Fell's main trustee was the Delegate [[Henry Aldrich]], Dean of Christ Church, who took a keen interest in the decorative work of Oxford's books. He and his colleagues presided over the end of Parker and Guy's lease, and a new arrangement in 1691 whereby the Stationers leased the whole of Oxford's printing privilege, including its unsold scholarly stock. Despite violent opposition from some printers in the Sheldonian, this ended the friction between Oxford and the Stationers, and marked the effective start of a stable university printing business.&lt;ref&gt;Carter pp. 105–09&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1713, Aldrich also oversaw the Press moving to the [[Clarendon Building]]. This was named in honour of [[Oxford University's Chancellor]], [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]]. Oxford lore maintained its construction was funded by proceeds from his book ''The History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England'' (1702–04). In fact, most of the money came from Oxford's new bible printer [[John Baskett]]—and the Vice-Chancellor [[William Delaune]] defaulted with much of the proceeds from Clarendon's work. In any event, the result was [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]'s beautiful but impractical structure beside the Sheldonian in [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]]. The Press worked here until 1830, with its operations split into the so-called ''Learned Side'' and ''Bible Side'' in different wings of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Carter p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, the early 18th century marked a lull in the Press's expansion. It suffered from the absence of any figure comparable to Fell, and its history was marked by ineffectual or fractious individuals such as the Architypographus and antiquary [[Thomas Hearne (antiquarian)|Thomas Hearne]], and the flawed project of Baskett's first bible, a gorgeously designed volume strewn with misprints, and known as the [[Vinegar Bible]] after a glaring typographical error in [[St. Luke]]. Other printing during this period included [[Richard Allestree]]'s contemplative texts, and [[Thomas Hanmer]]'s 6-volume edition of [[Shakespeare]], (1743–44).&lt;ref&gt;Barker p.&amp;nbsp;32&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect, these proved relatively minor triumphs. They were products of a university press that had come to embody increasing muddle, decay, and corrupt practice, and relied increasingly on leasing of its bible and prayer book work to survive.

The business was rescued by the intervention of a single Delegate, [[William Blackstone]]. Disgusted by the chaotic state of the Press, and antagonized by the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor]] [[George Huddesford (Vice-Chancellor)|George Huddesford]], Blackstone subjected the print shop to close scrutiny, but his findings on its confused organization and sly procedures met with only "gloomy and contemptuous silence" from his colleagues, or "at best with a languid indifference." In disgust, Blackstone forced the university to confront its responsibilities by publishing a lengthy letter he had written to Huddesford's successor, [[Thomas Randolph (Oxford)|Thomas Randolph]] in May 1757. Here, Blackstone characterized the Press as an inbred institution that had given up all pretence of serving scholarship, "languishing in a lazy obscurity … a nest of imposing mechanics." To cure this disgraceful state of affairs, Blackstone called for sweeping reforms that would firmly set out the Delegates' powers and obligations, officially record their deliberations and accounting, and put the print shop on an efficient footing.&lt;ref&gt;I.G. Phillip, ''William Blackstone and the Reform of the Oxford University Press'' (Oxford, 1957) pp. 45–72&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Randolph ignored this document, and it was not until Blackstone threatened legal action that changes began. The university had moved to adopt all of Blackstone's reforms by 1760.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, ch. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, the Press had become more focused. Early [[copyright]] law had begun to undercut the Stationers, and the university took pains to lease out its bible work to experienced printers. When the [[American War of Independence]] deprived Oxford of a valuable market for its bibles, this lease became too risky a proposition, and the Delegates were forced to offer [[Share (finance)|shares]] in the Press to those who could take "the care and trouble of managing the trade for our mutual advantage." Forty-eight shares were issued, with the university holding a controlling interest.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, classical scholarship revived, with works by [[Jeremiah Markland]] and [[Peter Elmsley]], as well as early 19th-century texts edited by a growing number of academics from mainland [[Europe]]&amp;nbsp;– perhaps the most prominent being [[August Immanuel Bekker]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Dindorf]]. Both prepared editions at the invitation of the [[Greek language|Greek]] scholar [[Thomas Gaisford]], who served as a Delegate for 50 years. During his time, the growing Press established distributors in [[London]], and employed the bookseller Joseph Parker in [[Turl Street]] for the same purposes in Oxford. Parker also came to hold shares in the Press itself.&lt;ref&gt;Barker pp. 36–39, 41. Sutcliffe p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

This expansion pushed the Press out of the Clarendon building. In 1825 the Delegates bought land in Walton Street. Buildings were constructed from plans drawn up by [[Daniel Robertson (architect)|Daniel Robertson]] and [[Edward Blore]], and the Press moved into them in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 41. Sutcliffe pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; This site remains the main office of OUP in the 21st century, at the corner of [[Walton Street]] and [[Great Clarendon Street]], northwest of Oxford city centre.

==19th century: Price and Cannan==
[[File:Oxford_University_Press_early_logo.jpg|thumb|Oxford University Press early logo]]

The Press now entered an era of enormous change. In 1830, it was still a [[joint stock]] printing business in an academic backwater, offering learned works to a relatively small readership of scholars and clerics. The Press was the product of "a society of shy hypochondriacs," as one historian put it.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe, pp. 1–2, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Its trade relied on mass sales of cheap bibles, and its Delegates were typified by Gaisford or [[Martin Routh]]. They were long-serving classicists, presiding over a learned business that printed 5 or 10 titles each year, such as Liddell and Scott's ''[[Greek-English Lexicon]]'' (1843), and they displayed little or no desire to expand its trade.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; Steam power for printing must have seemed an unsettling departure in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, [[Thomas Combe]] joined the Press and became the university's [[Printer (publishing)|Printer]] until his death in 1872. Combe was a better business man than most Delegates, but still no innovator: he failed to grasp the huge commercial potential of [[India paper]], which grew into one of Oxford's most profitable trade secrets in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 39–40, 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Combe earned a fortune through his shares in the business and the acquisition and renovation of the bankrupt paper mill at Wolvercote. He funded schooling at the Press and the endowment of [[St Barnabas Church, Oxford|St. Barnabas Church]] in Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Carter, ''Wolvercote Mill'' ch. 4 (second edition, Oxford, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Combe's wealth also extended to becoming the first patron of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], and he and his wife Martha bought most of the group's early work, including ''The Light of the World'' by [[William Holman Hunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Maas, ''Holman Hunt and the Light of the World'' (Scholar Press, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Combe showed little interest, however, in producing fine printed work at the Press.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known text associated with his print shop was the flawed first edition of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', printed by Oxford at the expense of its author [[Lewis Carroll]] (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

It took the 1850 [[Royal Commission]] on the workings of the university and a new Secretary, [[Bartholomew Price]], to shake up the Press.&lt;ref&gt;Barker pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed in 1868, Price had already recommended to the university that the Press needed an efficient executive officer to exercise "vigilant superintendence" of the business, including its dealings with [[Alexander Macmillan (publisher)|Alexander Macmillan]], who became the publisher for Oxford's printing in 1863 and in 1866 helped Price to create the Clarendon Press series of cheap, elementary school books&amp;nbsp;– perhaps the first time that Oxford used the Clarendon imprint.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 19–26&lt;/ref&gt; Under Price, the Press began to take on its modern shape. By 1865 the Delegacy had ceased to be 'perpetual,' and evolved into five perpetual and five junior posts filled by appointment from the university, with the Vice Chancellor a Delegate ex officio: a hothouse for factionalism that Price deftly tended and controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; The university bought back shares as their holders retired or died.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts' supervision passed to the newly created Finance Committee in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Major new lines of work began. To give one example, in 1875, the Delegates approved the series ''Sacred Books of the East'' under the editorship of [[Friedrich Max Müller]], bringing a vast range of religious thought to a wider readership.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp.&amp;nbsp;45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Equally, Price moved OUP towards publishing in its own right. The Press had ended its relationship with Parker's in 1863 and in 1870 bought a small London bindery for some bible work.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 16, 19. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan's contract ended in 1880, and wasn't renewed. By this time, Oxford also had a London warehouse for bible stock in [[Paternoster Row]], and in 1880 its manager Henry Frowde (1841–1927) was given the formal title of Publisher to the University. Frowde came from the book trade, not the university, and remained an enigma to many. One obituary in Oxford's staff magazine ''The Clarendonian'' admitted, "Very few of us here in Oxford had any personal knowledge of him."&lt;ref&gt;The Clarendonian, 4, no. 32, 1927, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, Frowde became vital to OUP's growth, adding new lines of books to the business, presiding over the massive publication of the [[Revised Version]] of the [[New Testament]] in 1881&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; and playing a key role in setting up the Press's first office outside Britain, in [[New York City]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 89–91&lt;/ref&gt;

Price transformed OUP. In 1884, the year he retired as Secretary, the Delegates bought back the last shares in the business.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The Press was now owned wholly by the university, with its own paper mill, print shop, bindery, and warehouse. Its output had increased to include school books and modern scholarly texts such as [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s [[Maxwell's equations|''A Treatise on Electricity &amp; Magnetism'']] (1873), which proved fundamental to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;Barker p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, without abandoning its traditions or quality of work, Price began to turn OUP into an alert, modern publisher. In 1879, he also took on the publication that led that process to its conclusion: the huge project that became the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED).&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 53–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Offered to Oxford by [[James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]] and the [[Philological Society]], the "New English Dictionary" was a grand academic and patriotic undertaking. Lengthy negotiations led to a formal contract. Murray was to edit a work estimated to take 10 years and to cost approximately £9,000.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt; Both figures were wildly optimistic. The Dictionary began to appear in print in 1884, but the first edition was not completed until 1928, 13 years after Murray's death, at a cost of around £375,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (Oxford, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This vast financial burden and its implications landed on Price's successors.

The next Secretary struggled to address this problem. Philip Lyttelton Gell was appointed by the Vice-Chancellor [[Benjamin Jowett]] in 1884. Despite his education at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] and a background in London publishing, Gell found the operations of the Press incomprehensible. The Delegates began to work around him, and the university finally dismissed Gell in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 98–107&lt;/ref&gt; The Assistant Secretary, Charles Cannan, took over with little fuss and even less affection for his predecessor: "Gell was always here, but I cannot make out what he did."&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Cannan had little opportunity for public wit in his new role. An acutely gifted classicist, he came to the head of a business that was successful in traditional terms but now moved into uncharted terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; By themselves, specialist academic works and the undependable bible trade could not meet the rising costs of the Dictionary and Press contributions to the [[University Chest]]. To meet these demands, OUP needed much more revenue. Cannan set out to obtain it. Outflanking university politics and inertia, he made Frowde and the London office the financial engine for the whole business. Frowde steered Oxford rapidly into popular literature, acquiring the [[Oxford World's Classics|World's Classics]] series in 1906. The same year saw him enter into a so-called "joint venture" with [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] to help with the publication of children's literature and medical books.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 141–48&lt;/ref&gt; Cannan insured continuity to these efforts by appointing his Oxford protégé, the Assistant Secretary [[Humphrey S. Milford]], to be Frowde's assistant. Milford became Publisher when Frowde retired in 1913, and ruled over the lucrative London business and the branch offices that reported to it until his own retirement in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 117, 140–44, 164–68&lt;/ref&gt; Given the financial health of the Press, Cannan ceased to regard scholarly books or even the Dictionary as impossible liabilities. "I do not think the University can produce enough books to ruin us," he remarked.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

His efforts were helped by the efficiency of the print shop. [[Horace Hart]] was appointed as Controller of the Press at the same time as Gell, but proved far more effective than the Secretary. With extraordinary energy and professionalism, he improved and enlarged Oxford's printing resources, and developed ''[[Hart's Rules]]'' as the first style guide for Oxford's proofreaders. Subsequently, these became standard in print shops worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 113–14&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he suggested the idea for the [[Clarendon Press Institute]], a social club for staff in Walton Street. When the Institute opened in 1891, the Press had 540 employees eligible to join it, including apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Hart's general interest in printing led to him cataloguing the "Fell Types", then using them in a series of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] and [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] facsimile volumes for the Press, before ill health led to his death in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe pp. 124–28, 182–83&lt;/ref&gt; By then, OUP had moved from being a parochial printer into a wide-ranging, university-owned publishing house with a growing international presence.

===London business===
Frowde had no doubt that the Press's business in London could be very largely increased and was appointed on contract with a commission on sales. Seven years later, as Publisher to the University, Frowde was using his own name as an imprint as well as 'Oxford University Press'. This style persisted till recent times, with two kinds of imprints emanating from the Press's London offices. The last man known as 'Publisher to the University' was [[John Gilbert Newton Brown]], known to his colleagues as 'Bruno'. The distinctions implied by the imprints were subtle but important. Books that London issued on commission (paid for by their authors or by some learned body) were styled 'Henry Frowde', or 'Humphrey Milford' with no mention of OUP, as if the Publisher were issuing them himself, while books that the Publisher issued under the rubric of the university bore the imprint 'Oxford University Press'. Both these categories were mostly handled by London, while Oxford (in practice the Secretary) looked after the Clarendon Press books. Commission books were intended as cash cows to fund the London Business's overheads, since the Press did not lay aside any resources for this purpose. Nevertheless, Frowde was especially careful to see that all commission books he published met with the Delegates' approval. This was not an uncommon arrangement for scholarly or [[antiquarian]] presses.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Price quickly primed Frowde for the imminent publication jointly with [[Cambridge University Press]] of the [[Revised Version]] of the Bible, which promised to be a '[[bestseller]]' on a scale that would require the employment of all the Press's resources to keep up with the demand. This was to be a complete retranslation of the text of the Bible from the oldest original Greek and Hebrew versions, superseding the [[Authorized Version]] of 1611. Frowde's agency was set up just in time, for the Revised Version, published on 17 May 1881, sold a million copies before publication and at a breakneck rate thenceforth, though overproduction ultimately made a dent in the profits.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Though Frowde was by no means an Oxford man and had no social pretensions of being one, he was a sound businessman who was able to strike the magic balance between caution and enterprise. From quite early on he had ideas of advancing the Press's overseas trade, at first in Europe and increasingly in America, Canada, India, and Africa. He was more or less singlehandedly responsible for setting up the American Branch as well as depots in [[Edinburgh]], [[Toronto]], and [[Melbourne]]. Frowde dealt with most of the logistics for books carrying the OUP imprint, including handling authors, binding, dispatching, and advertising, and only editorial work and the printing itself were carried out at or supervised from Oxford.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Frowde regularly remitted money back to Oxford, but he privately felt that the business was undercapitalized and would pretty soon become a serious drain on the university's resources unless put on a sound commercial footing. He himself was authorized to invest money up to a limit in the business but was prevented from doing so by family troubles. Hence his interest in overseas sales, for by the 1880s and 1890s there was money to be made in India, while the European book market was in the doldrums. But Frowde's distance from the Press's decision-making meant he was incapable of influencing policy unless a Delegate spoke for him. Most of the time Frowde did whatever he could within the mandate given him by the Delegates. In 1905, when applying for a pension, he wrote to [[J. R. Magrath]], the then Vice Chancellor, that during the seven years when he had served as manager of the Bible Warehouse the sales of the London Business had averaged about £20,000 and the profits £1,887 per year. By 1905, under his management as Publisher, the sales had risen to upwards of £200,000 per year and the profits in that 29 years of service averaged £8,242 per year.

===Conflict over secretaryship===
Price, trying in his own way to modernize the Press against the resistance of its own historical inertia, had become overworked and by 1883 was so exhausted as to want to retire. Benjamin Jowett had become vice chancellor of the university in 1882. Impatient of the endless committees that would no doubt attend the appointment of a successor to Price, Jowett extracted what could be interpreted as permission from the delegates and headhunted [[Philip Lyttelton Gell]], a former student acolyte of his, to be the next secretary to the delegates. Gell was making a name for himself at the publishing firm of [[Cassell, Petter and Galpin]], a firm regarded as scandalously commercial by the delegates. Gell himself was a patrician who was unhappy with his work, where he saw himself as catering to the taste of "one class: the lower middle",{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and he grasped at the chance of working with the kind of texts and readerships OUP attracted.

Jowett promised Gell golden opportunities, little of which he actually had the authority to deliver. He timed Gell's appointment to coincide with both the Long Vacation (from June to September) and the death of Mark Pattison, so potential opposition was prevented from attending the crucial meetings. Jowett knew the primary reason why Gell would attract hostility was that he had never worked for the Press nor been a delegate, and he had sullied himself in the city with raw commerce. His fears were borne out. Gell immediately proposed a thorough modernising of the Press with a marked lack of tact, and earned himself enduring enemies. Nevertheless, he was able to do a lot in tandem with Frowde, and expanded the publishing programmes and the reach of OUP until about 1898. Then his health broke down under the impossible work conditions he was being forced to endure by the Delegates' non-cooperation. The delegates then served him with a notice of termination of service that violated his contract. However, he was persuaded not to file suit and to go quietly.&lt;ref&gt;See chapter two of Rimi B. Chatterjee, ''Empires of the Mind: A History of the Oxford University Press in India During the Raj'' (New Delhi: OUP, 2006) for the whole story of Gell's removal.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|reason= No publisher, no link for verification present|date=October 2018}}

The delegates were not opposed primarily to his initiatives, but to his manner of executing them and his lack of sympathy with the academic way of life. In their view the Press was, and always would be, an association of scholars. Gell's idea of "efficiency" appeared to violate that culture, although subsequently a very similar programme of reform was put into practice from the inside.

Charles Cannan, who had been instrumental in Gell's removal, succeeded Gell in 1898, and [[Humphrey S. Milford]], his younger colleague, effectively succeeded Frowde in 1907. Both were Oxford men who knew the system inside out, and the close collaboration with which they worked was a function of their shared background and worldview. Cannan was known for terrifying silences, and Milford had an uncanny ability, testified to by Amen House employees, to 'disappear' in a room rather like a [[Cheshire cat]], from which obscurity he would suddenly address his subordinates and make them jump. Whatever their reasons for their style of working, both Cannan and Milford had a very hardnosed view of what needed to be done, and they proceeded to do it. Indeed, Frowde knew within a few weeks of Milford's entering the London office in [1904] that he would be replaced. Milford, however, always treated Frowde with courtesy, and Frowde remained in an advisory capacity till 1913. Milford rapidly teamed up with J. E. Hodder Williams of [[Hodder and Stoughton]], setting up what was known as the Joint Account for the issue of a wide range of books in education, science, medicine and also fiction. Milford began putting in practice a number of initiatives, including the foundations of most of the Press's global branches.

===Development of overseas trade===
Milford took responsibility for overseas trade almost at once, and by 1906 he was making plans to send a traveller to India and the Far East jointly with Hodder and Stoughton. N. Graydon (first name unknown) was the first such traveller in 1907, and again in 1908 when he represented OUP exclusively in India, the Straits and the Far East. A.H. Cobb replaced him in 1909, and in 1910 Cobb functioned as a travelling manager semi-permanently stationed in India. In 1911, [[E. V. Rieu]] went out to [[East Asia]] via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], had several adventures in [[China]] and [[Russia]], then came south to India and spent most of the year meeting educationists and officials all over India. In 1912, he arrived again in [[Mumbai|Bombay]], now known as Mumbai. There he rented an office in the dockside area and set up the first overseas Branch.

In 1914, [[Europe]] was plunged into turmoil. The first effects of the war were paper shortages and losses and disturbances in shipping, then quickly a dire lack of hands as the staff were called up and went to serve on the field. Many of the staff including two of the pioneers of the Indian branch were killed in action. Curiously, sales through the years 1914 to 1917 were good and it was only towards the end of the war that conditions really began pinching.

Rather than bringing relief from shortages, the 1920s saw skyrocketing prices of both materials and labour. Paper especially was hard to come by, and had to be imported from South America through trading companies. Economies and markets slowly recovered as the 1920s progressed. In 1928, the Press's imprint read 'London, Edinburgh, [[Glasgow]], [[Leipzig]], Toronto, Melbourne, [[Cape Town]], Bombay, [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]] and Shanghai'. Not all of these were full-fledged branches: in Leipzig there was a depot run by H. Bohun Beet, and in Canada and Australia there were small, functional depots in the cities and an army of educational representatives penetrating the rural fastnesses to sell the Press's stock as well as books published by firms whose agencies were held by the Press, very often including fiction and light reading. In India, the Branch depots in Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta were imposing establishments with sizable stock inventories, for the Presidencies themselves were large markets, and the educational representatives there dealt mostly with upcountry trade. The Depression of 1929 dried profits from the Americas to a trickle, and India became 'the one bright spot' in an otherwise dismal picture. Bombay was the nodal point for distribution to the Africas and onward sale to Australasia, and people who trained at the three major depots moved later on to pioneer branches in Africa and South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Milford's Letterbooks&lt;/ref&gt;

The Press's experience of [[World War II]] was similar to [[World War I]] except that Milford was now close to retirement and 'hated to see the young men go'. The [[The Blitz|London blitz]] this time was much more intense and the London Business was shifted temporarily to Oxford. Milford, now extremely unwell and reeling under a series of personal bereavements, was prevailed upon to stay till the end of the war and keep the business going. As before, everything was in short supply, but the U-boat threat made shipping doubly uncertain, and the letterbooks are full of doleful records of consignments lost at sea. Occasionally an author, too, would be reported missing or dead, as well as staff who were now scattered over the battlefields of the globe. DORA, the [[Defence of the Realm Act]], required the surrender of all nonessential metal for the manufacture of armaments, and many valuable [[electrotype]] plates were melted down by government order.

With the end of the war Milford's place was taken by Geoffrey Cumberlege. This period saw consolidation in the face of the breakup of the Empire and the post-war reorganization of the Commonwealth. In tandem with institutions like the [[British Council]], OUP began to reposition itself in the education market. [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] in his book ''Moving the Centre: The Struggle for Cultural Freedom'' records how the Oxford Readers for Africa with their heavily Anglo-centric worldview struck him as a child in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;Ngugi wa Thiongo, 'Imperialism of Language', in ''Moving the Centre: The Struggle for Cultural Freedom'' translated from the Gikuyu by [[Wangui wa Goro]] and Ngugi wa Thiong'o (London: Currey, 1993), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The Press has evolved since then to be one of the largest players in a globally expanding scholarly and reference book market.

====Indian branch====
When OUP arrived on Indian shores, it was preceded by the immense prestige of the ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'', edited by [[Friedrich Max Müller]], which had at last reached completion in 50 ponderous volumes. While actual purchase of this series was beyond the means of most Indians, libraries usually had a set, generously provided by the government of India, available on open reference shelves, and the books had been widely discussed in the Indian press. Although there had been plenty of criticism of them, the general feeling was that Max Müller had done India a favour by popularising ancient Asian ([[Persia]]n, [[Arabia|Arabic]], [[India]]n and [[China|Sinic]]) philosophy in the West.&lt;ref&gt;For an account of the ''Sacred Books of the East'' and their handling by OUP, see chapter 7 of [[Rimi B. Chatterjee]]'s ''Empires of the Mind: a history of the Oxford University Press in India during the Raj''; New Delhi: OUP, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=Verification failed|date=October 2018}} This prior reputation was useful, but the Indian Branch was not primarily in Bombay to sell Indological books, which OUP knew already sold well only in America. It was there to serve the vast educational market created by the rapidly expanding school and college network in British India. In spite of disruptions caused by war, it won a crucial contract to print textbooks for the [[Madhya Pradesh|Central Provinces]] in 1915 and this helped to stabilize its fortunes in this difficult phase. E. V. Rieu could not longer delay his callup and was drafted in 1917, the management then being under his wife Nellie Rieu, a former editor for the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' 'with the assistance of her two British babies.' It was too late to have important electrotype and stereotype plates shipped to India from Oxford, and the Oxford printing house itself was overburdened with government printing orders as the empire's propaganda machine got to work. At one point non-governmental composition at Oxford was reduced to 32 pages a week.

By 1919, Rieu was very ill and had to be brought home. He was replaced by [[Geoffrey Cumberlege]] and [[Noel Carrington]]. Noel was the brother of [[Dora Carrington]], the artist, and even got her to illustrate his ''Stories Retold'' edition of ''[[Don Quixote]]'' for the Indian market. Their father Charles Carrington had been a railway engineer in India in the nineteenth century. Noel Carrington's unpublished memoir of his six years in India is in the [[Oriental and India Office Collections]] of the [[British Library]]. By 1915 there were makeshift depots at Madras and Calcutta. In 1920, Noel Carrington went to Calcutta to set up a proper branch. There he became friendly with [[Edward John Thompson|Edward Thompson]] who involved him in the abortive scheme to produce the 'Oxford Book of Bengali Verse'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rimi B. Chatterjee]], 'Canon Without Consensus: [[Rabindranath Tagore]] and the "Oxford Book of Bengali Verse"'. ''[[Book History]]'' 4: 303–33.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|reason=Verification failed|date=October 2018}} In Madras, there was never a formal branch in the same sense as Bombay and Calcutta, as the management of the depot there seems to have rested in the hands of two local academics.

====East and South East Asia====
OUP's interaction with this area was part of their mission to India, since many of their travellers took in East and South East Asia on their way out to or back from India. Graydon on his first trip in 1907 had travelled the 'Straits Settlements' (largely the Federated Malay States and Singapore), China, and Japan, but was not able to do much. In 1909, A. H. Cobb visited teachers and booksellers in Shanghai, and found that the main competition there was cheap books from America, often straight reprints of British books.&lt;ref&gt;See Rimi B. Chatterjee, 'Pirates and Philanthropists: British Publishers and Copyright in India, 1880–1935'. In ''Print Areas 2: Book History in India'' edited by Swapan Kumar Chakravorty and Abhijit Gupta (New Delhi: Permanent Black, forthcoming in 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The copyright situation at the time, subsequent to the Chace Act of 1891, was such that American publishers could publish such books with impunity although they were considered contraband in all British territories. To secure copyright in both territories publishers had to arrange for simultaneous publication, an endless logistical headache in this age of steamships. Prior publication in any one territory forfeited copyright protection in the other.&lt;ref&gt;See Simon Nowell-Smith, ''International Copyright Law and the Publisher in the Reign of Queen Victoria: The Lyell Lectures, University of Oxford, 1965–66 ''(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobb mandated Henzell &amp; Co. of Shanghai (which seems to have been run by a professor) to represent OUP in that city.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The Press had problems with Henzell, who were irregular with correspondence. They also traded with Edward Evans, another Shanghai bookseller. Milford observed, 'we ought to do much more in China than we are doing' and authorized Cobb in 1910 to find a replacement for Henzell as their representative to the educational authorities.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} That replacement was to be Miss M. Verne McNeely, a redoubtable lady who was a member of the [[SPCK|Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]], and also ran a bookshop. She looked after the affairs of the Press very capably and occasionally sent Milford boxes of complimentary cigars. Her association with OUP seems to date from 1910, although she did not have exclusive agency for OUP's books. Bibles were the major item of trade in China, unlike India where educational books topped the lists, even if Oxford's lavishly produced and expensive Bible editions were not very competitive beside cheap American ones.

In the 1920s, once the Indian Branch was up and running, it became the custom for staff members going out or returning to take a tour of East and South East Asia. Milford's nephew R. Christopher Bradby went out in 1928. He returned to Britain just in time, for on 18 October 1931, the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese invaded Manchuria]]. Miss M. Verne McNeely wrote a letter of protest to the [[League of Nations]] and one of despair to Milford, who tried to comfort her.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Japan was a much less well-known market to OUP, and a small volume of trade was carried out largely through intermediaries. The Maruzen company was by far the largest customer, and had a special arrangement regarding terms. Other business was routed through H. L. Griffiths, a professional publishers' representative based in [[Sannomiya]], [[Kobe]]. Griffiths travelled for the Press to major Japanese schools and bookshops and took a 10 percent commission. [[Edmund Blunden]] had been briefly at the [[University of Tokyo]] and put the Press in touch with the university booksellers, Fukumoto Stroin. One important acquisition did come from Japan, however: [[A. S. Hornby]]'s ''[[Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]''. It also publishes textbooks for the primary and secondary education curriculum in Hong Kong. The Chinese-language teaching titles are published with the brand Keys Press (啟思出版社).

====North America====
The North American branch was established in 1896 at 91 Fifth Avenue in [[New York City, New York|New York City]] to facilitate the sale of [[Oxford University Press#Bibles|Oxford bibles]] in the United States. Subsequently, it took over marketing of all books of its parent from Macmillan. This office grew in sales between 1928 and 1936, eventually becoming one of the leading university presses in the United States. It is focused on scholarly and reference books, bibles, and college and medical textbooks. In the 1990s, this office moved from 200 Madison Avenue (a building it shared with [[Putnam Publishing]]) to 198 Madison Avenue, which was the former [[B. Altman and Company]] headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson, ed: ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'' p. 870.: 1995; [[Yale University Press]]; The [[New-York Historical Society]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====South America====
In December 1909 Cobb returned and rendered his accounts for his Asia trip that year. Cobb then proposed to Milford that the Press join a combination of firms to send commercial travellers around South America, to which Milford in principle agreed. Cobb obtained the services of a man called Steer (first name unknown) to travel through Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and possibly other countries as well, with Cobb to be responsible for Steer. Hodder &amp; Stoughton opted out of this venture, but OUP went ahead and contributed to it.

Steer's trip was a disaster, and Milford remarked gloomily that it 'bid fair to be the most costly and least productive on record' of all traveller's trips. Steer returned before he had covered more than half of his itinerary, and on returning failed to have his customs payments refunded, with the result that a hefty sum of £210 was lost to the Press. The Press was obliged to disburse 80 percent of the value of the books he had carried as 'incidental expenses', so even if they had got substantial orders they would still have made a loss. Few orders did in fact come out of the trip, and when Steer's box of samples returned, the London office found that they had not been opened further down than the second layer.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

====Africa====
Some trade with East Africa passed through [[Bombay]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Following a period of acting mostly as a distribution agent for OUP titles published in the UK, in the 1960s OUP Southern Africa started publishing local authors, for the general reader, but also for schools and universities. Its territory includes [[Botswana]], [[Lesotho]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Namibia]], as well as [[South Africa]], the biggest market of the five.

OUP Southern Africa is now one of the three biggest educational publishers in South Africa, and focuses its attention on publishing textbooks, dictionaries, atlases and supplementary material for schools, and textbooks for universities. Its author base is overwhelmingly local, and in 2008 it entered into a partnership with the university to support [[Mandela Rhodes Scholarship|scholarships]] for South Africans studying postgraduate degrees.

===Establishment of Music Department===
Prior to the twentieth century, the Press at Oxford had occasionally printed a piece of music or a book relating to musicology. It had also published ''The Yattendon Hymnal'' in 1899 and, more significantly, the first edition of ''[[The English Hymnal]]'' in 1906, under the editorship of [[Percy Dearmer]] and the then largely unknown [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Sir [[William Henry Hadow]]'s multi-volume ''[[Oxford History of Music]]'' had appeared between 1901 and 1905. Such musical publishing enterprises, however, were rare: "In nineteenth-century Oxford the idea that music might in any sense be educational would not have been entertained",&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe p. 210"&gt;Sutcliffe p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; and few of the Delegates or former Publishers were themselves musical or had extensive music backgrounds.

In the London office, however, Milford had musical taste, and had connections particularly with the world of church and cathedral musicians. In 1921, Milford hired [[Hubert J. Foss]], originally as an assistant to Educational Manager V. H. Collins. In that work, Foss showed energy and imagination. However, as Sutcliffe says, Foss, a modest composer and gifted pianist, "was not particularly interested in education; he was passionately interested in music."&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe p. 210" /&gt; When shortly thereafter Foss brought to Milford a scheme for publishing a group of essays by well-known musicians on composers whose works were frequently played on the radio, Milford may have thought of it as less music-related than education-related. There is no clear record of the thought process whereby the Press would enter into the publishing of music for performance. Foss's presence, and his knowledge, ability, enthusiasm, and imagination may well have been the catalyst bringing hitherto unconnected activities together in Milford's mind, as another new venture similar to the establishment of the overseas branches.&lt;ref name="Hinnells p. 6"&gt;Hinnells p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Milford may not have fully understood what he was undertaking. A fiftieth anniversary pamphlet published by the Music Department in 1973 says that OUP had "no knowledge of the music trade, no representative to sell to music shops, and—it seems—no awareness that sheet music was in any way a different commodity from books."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; However intentionally or intuitively, Milford took three steps that launched OUP on a major operation. He bought the Anglo-French Music Company and all its facilities, connections, and resources. He hired Norman Peterkin, a moderately well-known musician, as full-time sales manager for music. And in 1923 he established as a separate division the Music Department, with its own offices in Amen House and with Foss as first Musical Editor. Then, other than general support, Milford left Foss largely to his own devices.&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

Foss responded with incredible energy. He worked to establish "the largest possible list in the shortest possible time",&lt;ref name="Oxford p. 6"&gt;Oxford p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; adding titles at the rate of over 200 a year; eight years later there were 1750 titles in the catalogue. In the year of the department's establishment, Foss began a series of inexpensive but well edited and printed choral pieces under the series title "Oxford Choral Songs". This series, under the general editorship of W. G. Whittaker, was OUP's first commitment to the publishing of music for performance, rather than in book form or for study. The series plan was expanded by adding the similarly inexpensive but high-quality "Oxford Church Music" and "Tudor Church Music" (taken over from the [[Carnegie UK Trust]]); all these series continue today. The scheme of contributed essays Foss had originally brought to Milford appeared in 1927 as the ''Heritage of Music'' (two more volumes would appear over the next thirty years). [[Percy Scholes]]'s ''Listener's Guide to Music'' (originally published in 1919) was similarly brought into the new department as the first of a series of books on music appreciation for the listening public.&lt;ref name="Hinnells p. 6" /&gt; Scholes's continuing work for OUP, designed to match the growth of broadcast and recorded music, plus his other work in journalistic music criticism, would be later comprehensively organized and summarized in the ''[[Oxford Companion to Music]]''.

Perhaps most importantly, Foss seemed to have a knack for finding new composers of what he regarded as distinctively [[Music of the United Kingdom|English music]], which had broad appeal to the public. This concentration provided OUP two mutually reinforcing benefits: a niche in music publishing unoccupied by potential competitors, and a branch of music performance and composition that the English themselves had largely neglected. Hinnells proposes that the early Music Department's "mixture of scholarship and cultural nationalism" in an area of music with largely unknown commercial prospects was driven by its sense of cultural philanthropy (given the Press's academic background) and a desire to promote "national music outside the German mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In consequence, Foss actively promoted the performance and sought publication of music by [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[William Walton]], [[Constant Lambert]], [[Alan Rawsthorne]], [[Peter Warlock]] (Philip Heseltine), [[Edmund Rubbra]] and other English composers. In what the Press called "the most durable gentleman's agreement in the history of modern music,"&lt;ref name="Oxford p. 6" /&gt; Foss guaranteed the publication of any music that Vaughan Williams would care to offer them. In addition, Foss worked to secure OUP's rights not only to music publication and live performance, but the "mechanical" rights to recording and broadcast. It was not at all clear at the time how significant these would become. Indeed, Foss, OUP, and a number of composers at first declined to join or support the [[Performing Right Society]], fearing that its fees would discourage performance in the new media. Later years would show that, to the contrary, these forms of music would prove more lucrative than the traditional venues of music publishing.&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells pp. 18–19; OUP joined in 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever the Music Department's growth in quantity, breadth of musical offering, and reputation amongst both musicians and the general public, the whole question of financial return came to a head in the 1930s. Milford as London publisher had fully supported the Music Department during its years of formation and growth. However, he came under increasing pressure from the Delegates in Oxford concerning the continued flow of expenditures from what seemed to them an unprofitable venture. In their mind, the operations at Amen House were supposed to be both academically respectable and financially remunerative. The London office "existed to make money for the Clarendon Press to spend on the promotion of learning."&lt;ref&gt;Sutcliffe p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Further, OUP treated its book publications as short-term projects: any books that did not sell within a few years of publication were written off (to show as unplanned or hidden income if in fact they sold thereafter). In contrast, the Music Department's emphasis on music for performance was comparatively long-term and continuing, particularly as income from recurring broadcasts or recordings came in, and as it continued to build its relationships with new and upcoming musicians. The Delegates were not comfortable with Foss's viewpoint: "I still think this word 'loss' is a misnomer: is it not really capital invested?" wrote Foss to Milford in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus it was not until 1939 that the Music Department showed its first profitable year.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe p. 212"&gt;Sutcliffe p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; By then, the economic pressures of the Depression as well as the in-house pressure to reduce expenditures, and possibly the academic background of the parent body in Oxford, combined to make OUP's primary musical business that of publishing works intended for formal musical education and for music appreciation—again the influence of broadcast and recording.&lt;ref name="Sutcliffe p. 212" /&gt; This matched well with an increased demand for materials to support music education in British schools, a result of governmental reforms of education during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Under various commissions chaired by [[William Henry Hadow|Hadow]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Press did not cease to search out and publish new musicians and their music, but the tenor of the business had changed. Foss, suffering personal health problems, chafing under economic constraints plus (as the war years drew on) shortages in paper, and disliking intensely the move of all the London operations to Oxford to avoid [[The Blitz]], resigned his position in 1941, to be succeeded by Peterkin.&lt;ref&gt;Hinnells p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clarendon Press&lt;!--'Clarendon Press' redirects here--&gt;===
OUP came to be known as "('''The''') '''Clarendon Press'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" when printing moved from the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] to the Clarendon Building in Broad Street in 1713. The name continued to be used when OUP moved to its present site in Oxford in 1830. The label "Clarendon Press"&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; took on a new meaning when OUP began publishing books through its London office in the early 20th century. To distinguish the two offices, London books were labelled "Oxford University Press" publications, while those from Oxford were labelled "Clarendon Press" books. This labelling ceased in the 1970s, when the London office of OUP closed. Today, OUP reserves "Clarendon Press" as an imprint for Oxford publications of particular academic importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.oup.com/uk/archives/8.html# Oxford University Press website, Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The Yuzhi Wuti Qing Wenjian is organized into six boxes, containing 36 volumes on 2563 pages.  The original work contained 32 volumes, with a four-volume supplement.  It is divided into divisions (such as "Heaven Division"), category (such as "Astronomy"), with the categories further separated into types.  There are 56 divisions, 318 categories, 616 types, with a total of 18671 terms. Each term has eight rows.  From the top, the rows contain Manchu, Tibetan, a mechanical Tibetan transliteration into Manchu, a [[phonetic]] Tibetan transcription into Manchu, Mongolian, [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], a transcription of Chagatai into Manchu, and Chinese.

For some terms, synonyms were included in the target languages (except Chinese). Thus, there are 19503 terms used in Mongolian corresponding to 18145 terms in Chinese (with 526 synonyms noted in Chinese).  The '''Manchu''' text was largely based on the [[Manchu language#Beijing dialect of Manchu|Beijing dialect of Manchu]], using vertical regular script, with sentences terminated with punctuation ({{MongolUnicode|᠈&amp;#8239;|valign=middle}}), but no subsidiary pronunciation marks. '''Tibetan''' used the common written Tibetan usage at the time, in horizontal script in [[Uchen script]] ({{Bo-textonly|དབུ་མེད་}}), with terms that could not be written into a single line divided at syllabic boundaries, and terminating punctuation marks ({{Bo-textonly|།}}). Under the Tibetan was the Manchu transliteration, using Manchu phonemes to transliterate Tibetan letters to allow two-way transliteration and using distinctive characters for initial and medial phonemes; further, to transliterate some Tibetan letters, some new written forms for Manchu phonemes were invented (including initial "ng" and terminal vowels).  Below the Manchu transliteration was the Manchu transcription to record the pronunciation in the [[Central Tibetan language|Lhasa/Ü-Tsang dialect]], due to the [[diglossia|substantial difference]] between [[Classical Tibetan|written Tibetan]] and [[Tibetic languages|spoken Tibetan]]. For '''Mongolian''', the common written Mongolian of that time was used, in horizontal regular script, with punctuation marks at the end ({{MongolUnicode|᠈&amp;#8239;|valign=middle}}). Chagatai is written horizontally in [[Nastaʿlīq script]], with terms that could not be written into a single line divided at syllabic boundaries and no terminal punctuations.  Below Chagatai was Manchu transcription to record the [[Turpan Depression|eastern Xinjiang]] Turkic pronunciation,&lt;ref&gt;as opposed to Southern Xinjiang ([[Tarim Basin]]) and Northern Xinjiang ([[Dzungaria]])&lt;/ref&gt; due to the substantial difference between Chagatai and the spoken language of Xingjiang at the time; the sounds showed characteristics of the pronunciations used in the [[Hami Prefecture|Hami]]/[[Turpan]] regions;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|script-title=zh:《五体清文鉴》编纂过程及维吾尔文辞条研究概述|journal=《和田师范专科学校学报（汉文综合版）》|year=July 2005|volume=第25卷第三期总第35期|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Chinese''' was spelled in traditional Chinese characters, also in vertical regular script, with the diction showing the influence of common usage in the [[Beijing dialect|Beijing Mandarin]] dialect. No punctuation or pronunciation marks were used.

==Manuscripts and editions==

The ''Yu Zhi Wu Ti Qing Wen Jian'' has been transmitted in three known [[manuscript]]s, held by the Beijing [[Palace Museum]], the [[Yonghe Temple]], and the [[British Museum]] in London. A print edition doesn’t seem to exist. In 1957, the Ethnic Publishing House (Nationalities Publishing House, Minzu Chubanshe, 民族出版社) published a photo-mechanic reproduction of the dictionary, which was reprinted in 1998. In 1967, Japanese scholars recompiled the ''Yu Zhi Wu Ti Qing Wen Jian'' and added Latin transliteration into a work known as the ''Interpretation of the Wuti Qing Wenjian''. In 1967, an edition was published in [[Japan]] that added transliterations of Manchu, the Manchu transcriptions of the other languages and a Japanese translation. In 2013, a critical edition with complete transliterations as well as indices for all five languages was published in [[Germany]].

The ''Yu Zhi Wu Ti Qing Wen Jian'' is based on the ''Yu Zhi Si Ti Qing Wen Jian'' 御製四體清文鑑 ("Imperially-Published Four-Script Textual Mirror of Qing"), with Chagatai added as fifth language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Lexicography : A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911|issue=|first1=Heming|last1=Yong|first2=Jing|last2=Peng|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFBtTUZFxEC&amp;pg=PA398#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=398|isbn=0191561673|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four-language version of the dictionary with Tibetan was in turn based on an earlier three-language version with Manchu, Mongolian, and Chinese called the ''Yu Zhi Manzhu Menggu Hanzi San He Jieyin Qingwen Jian'' 御製滿珠蒙古漢字三合切音清文鑑 ("Imperially-Published Manchu Mongol Chinese Three pronunciation explanation mirror of Qing"), which was in turn based on the ''Yu Zhi Zengding Qingwen Jian'' 御製增訂清文鑑 ("Imperially-Published Revised and Enlarged mirror of Qing") in Manchu and Chinese, which used both Manchu script to transcribe Chinese words and [[Transcription into Chinese characters|Chinese characters to transcribe]] Manchu words with [[fanqie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Lexicography : A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911: A History from 1046 BC to AD 1911|issue=|first1=Heming|last1=Yong|first2=Jing|last2=Peng|editor-first=|editor-last=|edition=|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYFBtTUZFxEC&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=397|isbn=0191561673|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mongol the title of 御製滿珠蒙古漢字三合切音清文鑑 is "(Qaɣan-u bicigsen) Manzu Mongɣol Kitad üsüg ɣurban züil-ün ajalɣu nejilegsen toli bicig".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Etudes Mongoles et Sibériennes 16|author=Centre d'études mongoles et sibériennes|publisher=SEMS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0I7ML6rrzN0C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=yuzhi+wuti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u2xcVKO0DcnGsQSDy4GIBw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=yuzhi%20wuti&amp;f=false|page=67|isbn=|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Manchu the title of 御製增訂清文鑑 is "Han-i araha nonggime toktobuha Manju gisun-i buleku bithe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/mulu/fcman.html Wade Collection Manchu Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Central Asiatic Journal, Volume 36|author=|year=1992|publisher=O.

'''Pixabay.com''' is an international website for sharing high quality [[public domain]] photos, illustrations, [[vector graphic]]s, and film footage. As of November 2017, Pixabay offers over 1,188,454 free photos, illustrations, and vectors and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pixabay.com/ |title=Pixabay home page |publisher=Pixabay.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The enterprise was founded in November 2011 in [[Ulm]], [[Germany]] by Hans Braxmeier and Simon Steinberger. In March 2012, Pixabay was redesigned, switching from a personal image collection into an interactive [[online community]], supporting 20 languages. In May of the same year, a public Application Programming Interface ([[API]]) was launched, allowing third party users and website developers to search Pixabay's image database. Today, the API is being used by the designer community Psykopaint, and inside [[Jimdo]]'s [[WYSIWYG]] homepage editor. Along with [[Flickr]], [[YouTube]] and [[Wikimedia Commons]], in June 2012, Pixabay was included on [[Creative Commons]]' official CC search site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.creativecommons.org/|title=CC Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a regular basis, Pixabay received attention in international print and online magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noupe.com/freebie/pixabay-more-than-40-000-completely-free-photos-and-illustrations-73034.html |title=Pixabay: More Than 40,000 Completely Free Photos And Illustrations |publisher=Noupe |date=2012-11-05 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigazine.net/news/20121108-public-domain-pixabay/ |title=商用・非商用を問わず完全フリーで使えるハイクオリティな画像検索サイト「Pixabay」 |publisher=Gigazine |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvg.hu/tudomany/20130205_65_ezer_ingyenes_korlatozas_nelkul_letolt |title=HVG - 65 ezer ingyenes, korlátozás nélkül letölthető fantasztikus kép |publisher=Hvg.hu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/wirtschaft/webwelt/article106605938/Das-sind-die-besten-kostenlosen-Fotodatenbanken.html |title=Das sind die besten kostenlosen Fotodatenbanken |publisher=Welt.de |date=2011-11-23 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Von Rainer Schuldt, 14.06.2012, 19:00 Uhr |url=http://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cb-Ratgeber-Kurse-Internet-Bilder-und-Fotos-zum-Nulltarif-7569805.html#1 |title=Tolle Bilder zum Nulltarif |publisher=Computerbild.de |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/fotos/6-datenbanken-mit-gratis-bildern-slideshow/pixabay-com-photo-1345616264.html |title=Yahoo Nachrichten - 6 Datenbanken mit Gratis-Bildern |publisher=De.nachrichten.yahoo.com |date=2011-04-20 |accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Page 12/2012, "Low-Budget-Bildquellen", p. 70-74, www.page-online.de&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, six additional interface languages were implemented (Thai, Vietnamese, Greek, Slovak, Bulgarian, Danish) and in 2015, Pixabay started offering film footage in addition to images - all of which released under [[Creative Commons license]] [[CC0]].

== Description ==
On Pixabay, users can find and contribute quality images and footage films free of [[copyright]]s. For uploading files and downloading full sized images, a free registration is required. By uploading files, the contributors waive their copyright and related image rights under Creative Commons deed [[CC0]], thus permitting free usage of their work. Consequently, anyone is allowed to use, modify and redistribute the images freely - even in commercial applications - without asking for permission and without accreditation.

Depicted content may yet be protected by trademarks, publicity or privacy rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pixabay.com/ro/blog/posts/public-domain-images-what-is-allowed-and-what-is-4/|title=Public Domain Images - What is allowed and what is not?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure a high quality standard and avoid legal issues, all uploaded images are checked manually by Pixabay's staff members.

==Quality standards for contributors==
Image contributors must respect Pixabay's quality standards: The image file format must be [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[.psd|PSD]], [[Adobe Illustrator Artwork|AI]], or [[SVG]] and the file size may not be over 40 MB. Furthermore, all newly submitted images must have at least 3000 px at one side; they must show something useful and have no obvious technical flaws.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pixabay.com/ro/photos/tools/quality_rating/|title=Autentificare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Footage can be uploaded in [[MPEG]], [[QuickTime File Format|MOV]] and [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] format and file sizes may not surpass 300 MB. A minimum resolution of 1280×800 pixels is required, and clips should not exceed 60 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pixabay.com/ro/blog/posts/video-quality-guidelines-68/|title=Video Quality Guidelines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photographers==
In January 2016, there were about 33,200 active image authors. Hans Braxmeier himself contributed over 20,000 images, which were downloaded over two million times. The second most active contributor was geralt, who uploaded 10,000 images (over 4,5 million downloads).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pixabay.com/en/users/?order=popular|title=Top 100 photographers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff== 
Hans Braxmeier - founder and CEO of Pixabay - has studied computer science in [[Ulm]], Germany. During and after his studies, he launched several other web projects.

Simon Steinberger - co-founder and also CEO of Pixabay - studied chemistry in Ulm and finished his PhD in 2011. During this time, he started working in the IT sector and developed various other websites.

Achim Thiemermann is responsible for social media marketing and Olga Foma focuses on image quality control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pixabay.com/en/service/imprint/|title=About Us|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191404/https://pixabay.com/en/service/imprint/|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
Pixabay was ranked 501st on Alexa on September 14, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/pixabay.com|title=pixabay.com Site Overview|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google assigned the domain a PageRank of six.

==Visitors and users==
About 27% of Pixabay's visitors speak English, 20% Spanish, 11% Portuguese, 7% German, and 5% speak French.

'''PriceGrabber'''.com is a price-comparison shopping site and distributed content commerce service founded in 1999 by former CEOs Kamran Pourzanjani and Tamim Mourad.  The company partners with merchants, retailers, and sellers to provide information on a wide range of products. PriceGrabber.com was the first comparison-shopping engine to project tax and shipping cost information for a consumer during the price comparison process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pricegrabber.com/about.php/about=press/sub_opt=14/year_opt=1/article=1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acquisitions ==
In 2005, PriceGrabber was acquired by [[Experian]] for $485 million, negotiated by then-CEO and founder of the company, [[Kamran Pourzanjani]], along with Tamim Mourad, in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2005/12/14/afx2390699.html Forbes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216080349/http://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/afx/2005/12/14/afx2390699.html |date=December 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj_experian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Experian Buys PriceGrabber.com For $485 Million|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113456544561122262|website=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=20 December 2017|date=14 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10994">'''Publication of Archival, Library &amp; Museum Materials''' ('''PALMM''') is a cooperative initiative of the public universities of [[Florida]] in the United States to provide a central repository for smaller digital collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://palmm.fcla.edu Publication of Archival, Library &amp; Museum Materials], [http://www.fcla.edu/ Florida Center for Library Automation], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to contributing to PALMM, universities in Florida also host and maintain separate individual [[digital collection]]s as well as many large collaborative projects. In September 2011, Florida's Council of State University Libraries selected [[SobekCM]] to power a common digital library system across the state, replacing the software currently powering the PALMM collections.

Other large, collaborate digital libraries supported by public universities in Florida include:

*[[Florida International University]], which hosts and supports the [[Everglades Digital Library]] 
*[[Digital Library of the Caribbean]], with many contributing partners in Florida and the Caribbean&lt;ref&gt;[http://dloc.com/ Digital Library of the Caribbean]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==

=== Archives Florida ===
Archives Florida is a database of guides and inventories (finding aids) for Florida archive collections. Finding aids can be contributed by Florida libraries, museums, historical societies, and other groups. The database is constantly updated, and users can browse or search collectively or by individual archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://palmm2.fcla.edu/afl/|title = Archives Florida|date = |accessdate = |website = Publication of Archival Library &amp; Museum Materials|publisher = State University System of Florida|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributing libraries and museums include Broward County Library, Florida Atlantic University Libraries, Florida International University Libraries, Florida State University, Rollins College, and Winter Park Public Library.

=== Aerial Photography Florida ===
With approximately 160,000 photos, the Aerial Photography: Florida Collection is the largest and most complete collection of Florida aerial photographs outside of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ufdc.ufl.edu/aerials/?n=palmm|title = Aerial Photography: Florida|date = |accessdate = |website = UFDC|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs center on the changes in Florida's land use spanning the years of 1937 to 1990. This online collection was funded by three Library Services and Technology Act grants. Users can search using map search, flights by county, and ArcGIS search. Additionally, images can be downloaded as [[JPEG 2000]] files.

Aerial photography has been used as an educational resource, enabling farmers to better utilize their land and informing city planners in their decision-making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ufdc.ufl.edu/aerials/teachers|title = Teachers|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Big Cypress National Preserve Collection ===
Documenting the natural heritage of the [[Big Cypress National Preserve]], the Big Cypress National Preserve Collection serves as a digital photo-album showing the flora and fauna of this preserve in southwestern Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://palmm.fcla.edu/cypress/|title = Big Cypress National Preserve|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Publication of Archival Library &amp; Museum Materials|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was produced by the Preserve's staff alongside the Southwest Florida Library Network (SWFLN) in a project funded by the State of Florida's Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grants program.

=== Coral Gables Memory ===
Donated to the city of [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]] by Kerdyk Realty, Coral Gables Memory is an album that contains photographs of homes and business structures. Coral Gables is a planned community that took much inspiration from the Garden City and City Beautiful movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://miami.fiu.edu/coralgables/index.htm|title = Coral Gables Memory|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Publication of Archival Library &amp; Museum Materials|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the photographs in Coral Gables Memory collection were captured in the 1940s. Users will find visual and textual materials that document the history, culture, architecture, and people of Coral Gables. Additionally, minute books, published works, postcards, among other materials, can be viewed in this collection.

=== Everglades Digital Library ===
Established in 1996, the [[Everglades Digital Library]] (EDL) features online texts, articles, reports, photographs, maps, data sets, educational materials, and historical records all pertaining to the South Florida environment. The primary goal of this collection is to support research, education, decision making, and information resource management within the greater Everglades community. The materials within this collection originate from such sources as libraries, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions. The EDL is a service of the Digital Collections Center at Florida International University Libraries.

In terms of technology, the EDL runs on the Collection Workflow Integration System (CWIS), which was specifically created to help build collections in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math for the National Science Digital Library. Because of this system, the EDL enjoys many features, including [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] resource annotations and ratings, keyword searching, RSS feed support, an integrated metadata editing tool, prepackaged taxonomies, user-definable schema, and even user interface themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://cwis.fcla.edu/edl/index.php?P=About|title = About Everglades Digital Library|date = |accessdate = |website = Everglades Digital Library|publisher = Florida International University Libraries|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Florida Heritage Collection ===
Established in 1998 by the libraries of the State University System of Florida (SUS) in partnership with the Florida Center for Library Automation (FCLA) and the State Library of Florida, the Florida Heritage Collection is the first statewide digital library initiative in Florida. This collection is notable in that it provides online access to materials broadly representing Florida’s history, culture, arts, literature, sciences and social sciences. Some of the major focuses of the Florida Heritage Collection are Native American and minority populations, exploration and development, tourism, the natural environment, and regional interests. Florida's ten state universities contribute materials from their archives, special collections, and libraries to this collection.

Users viewing this collection will find a variety of local and regional materials about Florida's history and cultural, including local history books and booklets, advertising materials from the Florida Boom, Civil War letters, and other materials that provide knowledge of Florida's history. Due to the largely emigrant nature of Florida's history, the collection stresses the importance of featuring family papers and records, diaries, letters, business records, maps, photographs, and other materials that are unique and important for historical research.

In terms of workflow, the contributing university libraries and archives contribute catalog records for the digitized version to a central database. For each submission, libraries indicate the grade level of the material in accordance with Florida's [[Sunshine State Standards]].

=== Miami Metropolitan Archive ===
Developed in 2001, the Miami Metropolitan Archive is focused on preserving and sharing early Miami materials. The themes of this collection are local history, community development, urban planning and design, resource and environmental management, area studies, architecture, transportation, education, Black Miami, and multicultural issues. Miami Metropolitan Archive's goal is to provide digital access to important source materials on Miami-Dade County urban development. The Miami Metropolitan Archive is operated by the Urban, Regional &amp; Local Government Documents Department at Florida International University Libraries and Miami City Clerk's Office.

For the years of 1896 to 1966, users will find government documents, including Miami City Council meeting minutes, charters, departmental annual reports, and planning documents.

=== Florida Historical Quarterly ===
An online version of the academic journal by the same title, the goal of the Florida Historical Quarterly is to expand users' understanding of Florida's historical development. This collection emphasizes scholarly research and appreciation for the peoples, places, themes, and diversity of Florida's past.

Although the Florida Historical Quarterly was originally a part of the Florida Heritage Collection, in 2005 the Digital Projects Planning Committee decided to separate it into its own individual collection because of its high volume of use and the need for direct access.

=== Koreshan State Historic Site Collection ===
The Koreshan State Historic Site Collection focuses on the [[Koreshan State Historic Site]], one of Florida's state parks and a cultural heritage site. This collection serves as a digital photo-album of the site. The photographs within this collection were contributed by the Estero Historical Society and the Florida Division of Recreation and Parks - Koreshan State Historic Site.

The collection is funded by the Library Services and Technology Act Grants (LSTA).

When set, the following actions are prohibited by the [[domain name registry]]:
* '''Modification''' of the domain name, including:
** '''Transferring''' of the domain name
** '''Deletion''' of the domain name
* '''Modification''' of the domain contact details

Renewal of the domain name is, however, still possible when REGISTRAR-LOCK is set.

Not all [[Top-level domains]] (TLDs) support REGISTRAR-LOCK,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} e.g. .org.uk, and others.

The [[.ca]] TLD added support for REGISTRAR-LOCK in October 2010.

{{IETF RFC|2832}}, section 6, and {{IETF RFC|3632}}, section 2.1, lists the different status codes and their descriptions.

'''Sidi Lakhmi mausoleum''' or '''Sidi Abi Al Hassan Lakhmi mausoleum''' ([[Arabic]]: زاوية سيدي أبي الحسن اللخمي) is one the most important [[mausoleum]]s of the [[medina of Sfax]]. It is located outside the walls of the city.

== History ==
According to the inscription at the entrance of the mausoleum, the monument was built in the 17th century during the reign of the [[Muradid dynasty]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abi Al Hassan Al Lakhmi in the memory of Sfax|last=Ben Chaabene|first=Nihed|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=69–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; six centuries after the death of the saint Sidi Abu El Hassan El Lakhami in 1085. Initially, he was first buried in the old cemetery of Sfax (oldest cemetery in the city).

Over time, the mausoleum acquired important religious status and became a very important destination for prayer and seeking blessings for local communities in Sfax and adjacent. The building kept receiving visitors for centuries until its closure by the Tunisian authorities in 2011, after the [[Tunisian Revolution|revolution]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Location ==
The Sidi Lakhmi's zaouia is located outside the walls of the medina, on the north side near [[Bab Jebli]], and just next to [[Sidi Lakhmi mosque]].

== Architecture ==
Before the construction of [[Sidi Lakhmi mosque]] (also called El Jedid mosque), access to the mausoleum was through a small entrance in front of [[Bab Jebli]] and opens onto a small court. This court has two side galleries: The first, on the eastern side, is based on a column and gives access to the bathroom, an [[Ablution in Islam|abultion]] room and a water-well. The second, on the western side, is composed of two arches and leads to a small rectangular room.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The rectangular hall of the sanctuary is decorated with an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] style, and capitals with [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] style. It has a dome made of pottery tubes that help to reduce the total weight, and limestone corner blocks that ensure the transition from the square part of the basis to the circular one.

In [[historiography]], distinctions are commonly made between three kinds of source texts:

===Primary===
{{main|Primary source}}
[[Primary source]]s are firsthand written [[evidence]] of history made at the [[time]] of the event by someone who was present. They have been described as those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_"&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |date=2005-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources have been said to provide researchers with "direct, unmediated information about the object of study."&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

--&gt; Physical objects can be primary sources.

===Secondary and tertiary===
{{main|Secondary source|Tertiary source}}
[[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. These are not as authoritative and are supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These documents or people summarize other material, usually primary source material. They are academics, journalists, and other researchers, and the papers and books they produce. This includes published accounts, published works, or published research. For example a history book drawing upon diary and newspaper records. 

[[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources.&lt;ref name=umdguide /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. [http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html Glossary, Using Information Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html |date=2008-08-28 }}. ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources".) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_" /&gt; These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels. They consist of generalized research of a specific subject under consideration. Tertiary sources are analyzed, assimilated, evaluated, interpreted, and/or synthesized from secondary sources, also. These are not authoritative and are just supplemental documents concerning the subject under consideration. These are often meant to present known information in a convenient form with no claim to originality. Common examples are [[encyclopedia]]s and [[textbook]]s.

The distinction between  ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' is standard in [[historiography]], while the distinction between these sources and ''tertiary sources'' is more peripheral, and is more relevant to the scholarly research work than to the published content itself.

==Types==
Below are types of sources that most generally, but not absolutely, fall into a certain level. The letters after an item describes ''generally'' the type it is (though this can vary pending the exact source). ''P'' is for Primary sources, ''S'' is for Secondary sources, and ''T'' is for Tertiary sources. (ed., those with ''?''s are indeterminate.)

==In translation==
In translation, a source text (ST) is a text written in a given [[Source language (translation)|source language]] which is to be, or has been, translated into another language. In translation the source text (ST) is transformed into a [[target text]] (TT), written in a given [[Target language (translation)|target language]]. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the target text or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Translation scholars including [[Eugene Nida]] and [[Peter Newmark]] have represented the different approaches to translation as falling broadly into source-text-oriented or target-text-oriented categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing Translation Studies: theories and applications (4th ed.)|last=Munday|first=Jeremy|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-1138912557|location=London/New York|pages=67-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''South Park: The Stick of Truth''''' is a 2014 [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Obsidian Entertainment]] in collaboration with [[South Park Digital Studios]] and published by [[Ubisoft]]. Based on the American adult animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', the game follows the New Kid, who has moved to the eponymous town and becomes involved in an epic role-play fantasy war involving humans, wizards, and elves, who are fighting for control of the all-powerful Stick of Truth. Their game quickly escalates out of control and brings them into conflict with aliens, [[Nazi]] zombies, and gnomes, threatening the entire town with destruction.

The game is played from a [[2.5D]], [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective replicating the aesthetic of the television series. The New Kid is able to freely explore to the town of South Park, interacting with characters and undertaking quests, and accessing new areas by progressing through the main story. Selecting one of four character archetypes, [[Warrior (character class)|Fighter]], [[Thief (character class)|Thief]], [[Wizard (character class)|Mage]], and [[Jew]], each offering specific abilities, the New Kid and a supporting party of characters use a variety of melee, ranged, and magical fart attacks to combat with their enemies.

Development began in 2009 after ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] approached Obsidian about making a role-playing game designed to look exactly like the television series. Parker and Stone were involved throughout the game's production: they wrote its script, consulted on the design, and as in the television program they voiced many of the characters. ''The Stick of Truth''{{'}}s production was turbulent; following the bankruptcy of the original publisher, [[THQ]], the rights to the game were acquired by Ubisoft in early 2013, and its release date was postponed several times from its initial date in March 2013 to its eventual release in March 2014, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]].

''The Stick of Truth'' was subject to [[censorship]] in some regions because of its content, which includes abortions and Nazi imagery; Parker and Stone replaced the scenes with detailed explanations of what occurs in each scene. The game was released to positive reviews, which praised the comedic script, visual style, and faithfulness to the source material. It received criticism for a lack of challenging combat and technical issues that slowed or impeded progress. A sequel, ''[[South Park: The Fractured but Whole]]'', was released in October 2017, and ''The Stick of Truth'' was re-released in February 2018, for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]], and on [[Nintendo Switch]] in September 2018.

==Gameplay==
''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' is a [[role-playing video game]]&lt;ref name="RevHardcore"/&gt; that is viewed from a [[2.5D]], [[Third-person (video games)|third-person]] perspective.&lt;ref name="RevMetroWeekly"/&gt; The player controls the New Kid as he explores the fictional Colorado town of South Park.&lt;ref name="DestructPreview"/&gt; The player can freely move around the town although some areas remain inaccessible until specific points in the story are reached. Notable characters from the series—including [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], [[Stan Marsh|Stan]], and [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]]—join the New Kid's party and accompany him on his quests,&lt;ref name="DestructPreview"/&gt; though only one character can be active at any time.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; The game features a fast travel system, allowing the player to call on the character [[Timmy Burch|Timmy]] to quickly transport them to any other visited fast travel station.&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UbiBlog"/&gt; At the beginning of the game, the player selects one of four character archetypes; the [[Warrior (character class)|Fighter]], [[Thief (character class)|Thief]], [[Mage (character class)|Mage]] (which represent standard fantasy types), and the Jew. The Jew class specializes in "Jew-jitsu" and long-range attacks. Each class has specific abilities; armor and weapons are not limited by class, allowing a Mage to focus on melee attacks like a Fighter.&lt;ref name="DestructPreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;

The New Kid and his allies possess a variety of melee, ranged, and magic attacks.&lt;ref name="RevGI"/&gt; Experience points rewarded for completing tasks and winning battles allow the New Kid to level up,&lt;ref name="DestructPreview"/&gt; unlocking new abilities and upgrades such as increasing the number of enemies an attack hits or the amount of damage inflicted.&lt;ref name="RevGI"/&gt; Magic is represented by the characters' ability to fart;&lt;ref name="GIMagic"/&gt; different farts are used to accomplish specific tasks. For example,  the "Cup-A-Spell" allows the player to throw a fart to interact with a distant object,&lt;ref name="PolyMagic"/&gt; the "Nagasaki" destroys blockades, and the "Sneaky Squeaker" can be thrown to create a sound that distracts enemies.&lt;ref name="EGMReview"/&gt; Attacks can be augmented with farts if the player has enough magical energy.&lt;ref name="RPSMagic"/&gt;
[[File:SouthParkTheStickofTruth-GameplayBattle.jpeg|thumb|left|"The New Kid" (top left) and his ally Cartman (bottom left) battle Nazi Zombies (right). A radial menu system offers an array of strategic choices, such as basic attacks, special abilities, support items, and the ability to summon powerful allies.]]

The player has access to unlockable abilities that can open new paths of exploration, such as shrinking to access small areas like vents,&lt;ref name="VentureBeatAbility"/&gt; teleportation which allows the player to reach otherwise unreachable platforms, and farts which trigger an explosion that defeats nearby enemies when combined with a naked flame.&lt;ref name="OXMReview"/&gt; Actions committed against enemies outside of battle affects them in combat; the player or opponent who strikes first to trigger a fight will have the first turn in battle.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIHurtEnemy"/&gt; Combat takes place in a battle area separate from the open game world.&lt;ref name="GIGameplay2"/&gt; Battles use turn-based gameplay and each character takes a turn to attack or defend before yielding to the next character.&lt;ref name="OXMReview"/&gt;

During the player's turn, a radial wheel listing the available options{{mdash}}class-based basic melee attacks, special attacks, long-ranged attacks, and support items{{mdash}}appears.&lt;ref name="OPMGameplay"/&gt; Basic attacks are used to hit unarmored enemies and wear down shields; heavy attacks weaken armored enemies.&lt;ref name="SettingJoy"/&gt; A flashing icon indicates that attacks or blocks can be enhanced to inflict more damage,or mitigate incoming attacks more effectively.&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt; Each special attack costs a set amount of "Power Points" or "PP" (pronounced [[Urine|peepee]]) to activate.&lt;ref name="DestructPreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt; Only one party member can join the player in battle.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; Certain characters, such as [[Tuong Lu Kim]],&lt;ref name="The Esacapist"/&gt; [[List of recurring South Park characters#Mr. Hankey|Mr Hankey]],&lt;ref name="VG247Story"/&gt; [[List of recurring South Park characters#Jesus|Jesus]], and [[Mr. Slave]] can be summoned during battle to deliver a powerful attack capable of defeating several enemies simultaneously; Jesus sprays damaging gunfire, while Mr. Slave squeezes an enemy into his rectum, scaring his allies away.&lt;ref name="SettingJoy"/&gt;

One support item can be used each turn, including items that restore health or provide beneficial [[status effect]]s that improve the character's abilities.&lt;ref name="RevHardcore"/&gt; Weapons and armor can be enhanced using optional "strap-ons",&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt; such as fake vampire teeth, bubble gum,&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt; or a [[Jewpacabra]] claw.&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt; These items can cause enemies to bleed and lose health,&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt; weaken enemy armor, boost player health&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt; or steal health from opponents, and disgust foes to make them "grossed out" and cause them to vomit.&lt;ref name="GIGameplay2"/&gt; Additionally, the "strap-ons" can set opponents on fire, electrocute them,&lt;ref name="RevGiantBomb"/&gt; or freeze them.&lt;ref name="The Esacapist"/&gt; Some enemies are immune to one or more of these effects.&lt;ref name="The Esacapist"/&gt; Enemies can deflect certain attacks entirely; those in a riposte stance will deflect any melee attack, requiring the use of ranged weapons, while those in reflect stance will deflect ranged weapons.&lt;ref name="RevHardcore"/&gt;

The player is encouraged to explore the wider game world to find [[Chinpokomon]] toys&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt; or new friends who are added to the character's [[Facebook]] page.&lt;ref name="OXMReview"/&gt; Collecting friends allows the player to unlock perks that permanently improve the New Kid's statistics, providing extra damage or resistance to negative effects.&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RevGI"/&gt; The character's Facebook page also serves as the game's main menu, containing the inventory and a quest journal.&lt;ref name="DestructPreview"/&gt; ''The Stick of Truth'' features several mini-games, including defecating by repeatedly tapping a button that rewards the player with feces that can be thrown at enemies to trigger the "grossed out" effect, performing an abortion,&lt;ref name="ComplexMini"/&gt; and using an anal probe.&lt;ref name="PCGamerMini"/&gt; Some of these scenes are absent from some versions of the game because of censorship.&lt;ref name="PCGamerMini"/&gt;

===Plot===
The New Kid has moved with his parents to South Park to escape his forgotten past. He quickly allies with Butters, Princess Kenny and their leader Cartman. Nicknamed "Douchebag", the New Kid is introduced to the coveted Stick of Truth. Shortly thereafter, the elves attack Kupa Keep and take the Stick. Cartman banishes Clyde from the group for failing to defend the Stick from the elves. With the help of Cartman's best warriors, Douchebag recovers the Stick from Jimmy. That night, Douchebag and several town residents are abducted by aliens. Douchebag escapes his confinement with the help of Stan's father, Randy, and crashes the alien ship into the town's mall.

By morning, the UFO crash site has been sealed off by the government, who has put out a cover-story that claims a [[Taco Bell]] is being built. Douchebag visits Kupa Keep and learns that the Stick has again been stolen by the elves. Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with recruiting the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting to blow up the town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into [[Adolf Hitler]]-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.

That night, Cartman or Kyle (dependent on which character the player chooses to follow) leads his side against the other at the school. Here, the children learn that Clyde  stole the Stick as revenge for his banishment. Clyde rallies defectors from the humans and elves, and uses the alien goo to create an army of Nazi Zombies. The humans and elves join together to oppose Clyde but there are too few to fight him. Later, Gnomes steal Douchebag's underpants; after defeating them, Douchebag gains the ability to change size at will.

Out of desperation, Douchebag is told to invite the girls to play. They agree to join after Douchebag infiltrates an abortion clinic and travels across Canada to discover which of their friends is spreading gossip. Flanked by the girls, kindergarten pirates, and ''[[Star Trek]]'' role-players, the humans and elves attack Clyde's dark tower. Randy arrives and reveals that the government agents have planted a nuclear device in Mr. Slave's anus to blow up South Park, forcing Douchebag to shrink and enter Mr. Slave to disarm the bomb.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; After exiting Mr. Slave, Douchebag finally confronts Clyde and is forced to fight a resurrected Nazi Zombie [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]]; Chef is defeated. Clyde decides he is not playing any more and Cartman kicks him from the tower.

The government agents arrive, revealing that Douchebag went into hiding to escape them because of his ability to quickly make friends on [[social network]]s such as Facebook, which the government wanted to use for its own ends. Learning of the Stick's supposed power, the chief agent takes it and bargains with Douchebag to help him use it. Douchebag refuses but Princess Kenny betrays the group, uses the Stick to fight them and infects himself with the Nazi Zombie virus. Unable to defeat Nazi Zombie Princess Kenny, Cartman tells Douchebag to break their sacred rule by farting on Kenny's balls, which he does. The resulting explosion defeats Kenny and cures the town of the Nazi Zombie virus. In the epilogue as South Park is rebuilt, the group retrieves the Stick of Truth; they decide its power is too great for any person to hold and throw it into Stark's Pond.&lt;ref name="PlotEnd"/&gt;

==Development==

Development of ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' took four years, beginning in 2009 when ''South Park'' co-creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] contacted [[Obsidian Entertainment]] to discuss their desire to make a ''South Park'' game. Parker, a fan of Obsidian games, including ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), wanted to create a role-playing game, a genre which he and Stone had enjoyed since their childhoods.&lt;ref name="EurogamerDev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTDev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamasutra_announcement"/&gt; Parker and Stone insisted that the game must replicate the show's visual style.&lt;ref name="EurogamerDev"/&gt; Parker's original concept was for a ''South Park'' version of the 2011 role-playing fantasy game ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'', and he estimated the first script he produced to be 500 pages long.&lt;ref name="NYTDev"/&gt; The [[South Park#Video games|South Park Digital Studios]] team animated a concept of the game's opening scene to show what they wanted to accomplish with Obsidian in terms of appearance and gameplay mechanics.&lt;ref name="JoystiqAvellone"/&gt; While the series had inspired several licensed games, such as ''[[South Park (video game)|South Park]]'' (1998) and ''[[South Park Rally]]'' (1999), Parker and Stone were not involved in these games' development and later criticized the titles' quality. Negative reaction to those games made the pair protective of their property and led to their greater involvement on ''The Stick of Truth''; they refused several requests to license the series for new ventures.&lt;ref name="NYTDev"/&gt;

Stone and Parker worked closely with Obsidian on the project, sometimes having two-to-three hour meetings over four consecutive days. They worked with Obsidian until two weeks before the game was shipped.&lt;ref name="EurogamerDev"/&gt; Their involvement extended beyond creative input; their company initially financed the game, believing that a game based on the controversial television show would struggle to receive financial support from publishers without them placing restrictions on the content to make it more marketable. The initial funding was intended to allow Obsidian to develop enough of the game to show a more complete concept to potential publishers.&lt;ref name="EurogamerDev"/&gt; In December 2011, THQ announced that they would work with Obsidian on ''South Park: The Game'', as it was then known.&lt;ref name="announcement_pr"/&gt; This partnership developed into a publishing arrangement after ''South Park'' owner Viacom, having grown wary of video games, cut its funding. Obsidian was aware when it signed with THQ that the latter was experiencing financial difficulties.&lt;ref name="EurogamerDev"/&gt;

In March 2012, Microsoft canceled Obsidian's upcoming [[Xbox One]] project codenamed "North Carolina" after seven months of development, resulting in the layoff of between 20 and 30 employees, including members of the ''Stick of Truth'' team.&lt;ref name="JoystiqLayoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KotakuLayoff"/&gt; In May 2012, the game's final title was announced.&lt;ref name="GIName"/&gt; In December 2012, THQ filed for [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]] after suffering several product release failures. ''The Stick of Truth'' remained on schedule as THQ tried to use the bankruptcy period to restructure and return its business to profit, but the company failed to find a buyer and a Delaware court ordered that THQ was worth more if its assets were sold individually.&lt;ref name="EuroTHQBankrupt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IDigitalBankrupt"/&gt;

The rights to ''The Stick of Truth'' were auctioned in late December 2012; Obsidian was not made aware of the sale until the auction was announced.&lt;ref name="EurogamerDev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroAuction"/&gt; South Park Digital Studios filed an objection to the auction, stating that THQ did not have the authority to sell the publishing rights and that THQ had been granted exclusive use of specific ''South Park'' trademarks and copyrights. South Park Digital also argued that even if the rights were sold, THQ would still owe them {{USD|2.27 million}} and that they held the option of reclaiming all elements of the game and ''South Park'' related creations. THQ requested that the court overrule South Park Digital, stating that their rights were exclusive and thus transferable. On January 24, 2013, the United States bankruptcy court approved the sale of THQ's assets, including ''The Stick of Truth''.&lt;ref name="JoystiqAuction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JoystiqAuction2"/&gt;

The rights were bought by [[Ubisoft]] for {{USD|3.2 million}}. Within three weeks they had decided that the game required significant changes, pushing its release date back by six months to March 2014. Parker and Stone, with input from a Ubisoft creative consultant, concluded that their original vision would take too long and would be too costly to produce.&lt;ref name="NYTDev"/&gt; In a 2014 interview, Obsidian leader [[Feargus Urquhart]] said he could not comment on changes that were made following Ubisoft's involvement.&lt;ref name="EurogamerDev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroAuction"/&gt; ''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' was officially [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|released to manufacturing]] on February 12, 2014.&lt;ref name="IGNGold"/&gt; Following its release, Stone said that the work involved in making the game was much more than he and Parker had anticipated. He said, "I'll [admit] to the fact that we retooled stuff that we didn't like and we worked on the game longer than other people would've liked us to".&lt;ref name="IGNSequel"/&gt;

{{quote box|quote=I haven't played it [''EarthBound''] again in forever, but I just remember something being about "Oh wow, I'm a little kid in a house and there's my mom and I go outside my house and am fighting like an ant and a little mouse." It started out feeling so real,... I kept having in my head "do I really want [''South Park: The Stick of Truth''] to feel like that you are a little kid and you're playing this game and bigger shit ends up happening."|salign=right|source=–Trey Parker, ''South Park'' co-creator&lt;ref name="DestruInspiration"/&gt;|width=35%|}}

During early discussions with Obsidian, Parker and Stone were adamant that the game should faithfully replicate the show's unique 2D-style visuals, which are based on [[cutout animation]]. Obsidian provided [[Proof of concept|proofs of concept]] that they could achieve the ''South Park'' look; Stone and Parker were satisfied with this.&lt;ref name="crafting" /&gt; The show is animated using [[Autodesk Maya]], but Obsidian produced the game assets and animations in [[Adobe Flash]].&lt;ref name="GIAnimation"/&gt; ''Skyrim'' was the game's initial influence and further inspiration came from the 1994 role-playing game ''[[EarthBound]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTDev"/&gt; Parker and Stone said that the blended 2D/3D visuals of ''[[Paper Mario]]'' and the silent protagonist [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series also provided inspiration for the design.&lt;ref name="DestruInspiration"/&gt; The characters' costumes and classes are taken from the 2002 ''South Park'' episode "[[The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers]]".&lt;ref name="CNNTwoTowers"/&gt; Obsidian created various fantasy-styled items, armor, and weapons but Parker and Stone told them to "make it crappier" to create the impression that the children had found or made the objects themselves; weapons consisted of golf clubs, hammers, suction cup arrows and wooden swords, while bathrobes, oven mitt gloves, and towels worn as capes served as clothing. ''South Park'' studios provided Obsidian with access to the show's full archive of art assets, allowing Obsidian to include previously unused ideas, such as discarded Chinpokomon designs.&lt;ref name="GIItems"/&gt; Actors from the show provided voice work, and Obsidian was given access to ''South Park''{{'}}s audio resources, including sound effects, music, and the show's composer Jamie Dunlap.&lt;ref name="GIMusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IndieWireDunlap"/&gt;

Describing the writing of a comedy script for a game in which lines of dialog may be heard repeatedly and jokes could appear dated, Stone said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We write jokes, and the jokes are funny. With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, and then you question it, and you go round this emotional circle&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny ''South Park'' scenes, hopefully it's more than that.&lt;ref name="MetroStone"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Like the show, ''The Stick of Truth'' satirizes political and social issues including abortion, race relations, anal probes, drug addiction, sex, extreme violence, and poverty. Creative consultant Jordan Thomas said, "The way we looked at [humor] was if this moment was a hot button for the audience, should we make it worse, because [Stone and Parker] love to push boundaries and their default response was definitely not to back down, but the really healthy counterbalance was, can we make it funnier{{mdash}}and the answer was often yes".&lt;ref name="DestructPreview"/&gt;

The game underwent several changes during its development. While the final game features four playable character types (Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Jew), an early version featured five playable classes: Paladin, Wizard, Rogue, Adventurer, and Jew. The latter was described as a cross between a [[Monk (character class)|Monk]] and a [[Paladin (character class)|Paladin]], that is "high risk, high reward" and strongest when closest to death.&lt;ref name="Joystiq5Classes"/&gt; The game had included other enemies and locations, including vampire children who were fought in a cemetery and church, hippies, a mission to recover Cartman's doll from the Ginger children, and boss fights against a large, winged monster,&lt;ref name="GICutContentPG1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GICutContentPG2"/&gt; and celebrity [[Paris Hilton]]{{mdash}}her main attack being called the "vag blast".&lt;ref name="IGNHilton"/&gt; The Crab People had a larger role and shared a demilitarized zone with the Underpants Gnomes{{mdash}}only one Crab Person appears in the final game{{mdash}}and Mr Hankey and his family lived in a large, Christmas-themed village which became a small house in the town's sewers.&lt;ref name="GICutContentPG1"/&gt; Urquhart later said that when development began, video games were less protected by freedom of speech laws than other media, restricting the content that could be included in ''The Stick of Truth''.&lt;ref name="IGNHilton"/&gt; While under THQ's publishing deal, the developers planned that the Xbox 360 version would support the console's input device, [[Kinect]], enabling players to give characters voice commands, taunt enemies, and insult Cartman{{mdash}}to which the character would respond. Exclusive Xbox 360 [[downloadable content]] (DLC) including the ''Mysterion Superhero'' pack and ''[[Good Times with Weapons]]'' packs each featuring a unique weapon, outfit, and special attack, and three story-based campaign expansions was announced. These features were not present in the Ubisoft release.&lt;ref name="CVGDLC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JoystiqKinect"/&gt;

==Release==
''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' was released in North America on March 4, 2014, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and Microsoft Windows. It was released on March 6 in Australia and on March 7 in Europe.&lt;ref name="ReleaseMarch2014"/&gt; The game had been scheduled for release on March 5, 2013, but this was postponed two months by then-publisher THQ.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDateMar13"/&gt; After THQ filed for bankruptcy in January 2013, Ubisoft purchased the rights to publish the game and did not specify a release date.&lt;ref name="Ubisoft" /&gt; By May 2013, Ubisoft had confirmed that it would be released that year after it was omitted from their upcoming games release schedule.&lt;ref name="ReleasePostponed"/&gt; On September 26, 2013, Ubisoft announced that ''The Stick of Truth'' would be released in December 2013,&lt;ref name="ReleaseDateDec13"/&gt; but in October 2013 the game's release was again postponed until March 2014.&lt;ref name="ReleasePostponed2"/&gt; The game was scheduled for release on March 6, 2014 in Germany and Austria, but it was delayed after the localized version of the game was found to contain Nazi references.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDateGermany"/&gt; Alongside the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] version of the game, ''The Stick of Truth'' received a digital download release for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on June 13, 2016. The console versions were only available as a free pre-order incentive to customers who pre-ordered its sequel, ''The Fractured But Whole''.&lt;ref name="PS4XboxOne"/&gt; A stand-alone physical and digital download was released on for February 13, 2018, for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.&lt;ref name="Ps4xbox"/&gt; A [[Nintendo Switch]] version, available as a digital download, was released on September 25, 2018.&lt;ref name="NintendoSwitch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/17/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-coming-to-switch | title=  South Park: The Stick Of Truth Coming To Switch | first = Adam | last = Bankhurst | date = September 17, 2018 | accessdate = September 7, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collector's edition called the "Grand Wizard Edition" containing the game, a 6-inch figure of Grand Wizard Cartman created by [[Kidrobot]], a map of the South Park kingdom, and the ''Ultimate Fellowship'' DLC was made available. The ''Ultimate Fellowship'' content includes four outfits with different abilities; the Necromancer Sorcerer outfit provides increased fire damage, the Rogue Assassin outfit rewards the player with extra money, the Ranger Elf outfit raises weapon damage, and the Holy Defender outfit increases defense.&lt;ref name="IGNGrandWizard"/&gt; Additional content included the ''Super Samurai Spaceman'' pack containing three outfits; the Superhero costume provides a buff at the start of battle, the Samurai costume provides a buff on defeating an enemy, and the Spaceman costume provides a defensive shield.&lt;ref name="IGNDLC"/&gt;

In November and December 2013, the ''South Park'' television series featured the "Black Friday" trilogy of episodes{{mdash}}"[[Black Friday (South Park)|Black Friday]]", "[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]", and "[[Titties and Dragons]]"{{mdash}}which was a narrative prequel to the game and featured the characters wearing outfits and acting out roles similar to those in the game.&lt;ref name="GIBlackFriday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GIBlackFriday2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AVBlackFriday"/&gt; The episodes satirized the game's lengthy development; in "Black Friday" Cartman tells Kyle not to "pre-order a game that some assholes in California haven’t even finished making yet", referring to California-based Obsidian,&lt;ref name="DenofGeekBlack"/&gt; while "Titties and Dragons" concludes with an advertisement announcing the game's release date accompanied by Butters declaring his skepticism.&lt;ref name="EpTandD"/&gt; Discussing "Black Friday", [[IGN]] said that it "felt like a sneak peek" of the game and if nothing else, was "good marketing" in light of the game's numerous delays.&lt;ref name="IGNBlackFriday"/&gt;

===Censorship===
[[File:South Park The Stick of Truth Euro Censor.jpg|thumb|left|In European territories, certain sections of the game were replaced with cards explaining events depicted in the scene and mocking the reasons it cannot be viewed.]]

Shortly before the game's release, Ubisoft announced that it would voluntarily censor seven scenes, calling it a "market decision made by Ubisoft EMEA" and not a response to input from censors.&lt;ref name="IGNCEnsor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroCensor"/&gt; PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions were affected in European territories, the Middle East, Africa, and Russia, while the Microsoft Windows version remained uncensored.&lt;ref name="GuardianCensor"/&gt; The censorship affected all formats in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, Austria, and Taiwan.&lt;ref name="EscapistCensor"/&gt; The North American release was the only version that was uncensored on all formats. The German version was specifically censored because of the use of Nazi and Hitler-related imagery, including swastikas and Nazi salutes, which are illegal in that country. A spokesman for the European video game content rating system [[Pan European Game Information]] (PEGI) confirmed that the uncensored version had been submitted and approved for release with an 18 rating, meaning the game would be acceptable for people over eighteen years of age. Ubisoft resubmitted the censored version without input from PEGI; this version was passed with an 18-rating.&lt;ref name="GuardianCensor"/&gt;

The scenes Ubisoft removed depict anal probing by aliens and the player-character performing an abortion. In their place, the game displays a still image of a statue holding its face in its hand, with an explicit description of events depicted in the scene.&lt;ref name="GuardianCensor"/&gt; In Australia, the same scenes were removed because the [[Australian Classification Board]] refused to rate the game for release due to the depiction of sexual violence{{mdash}}specifically the child player-character being subjected to anal probing and the interactive abortion scene. Like the European version, these scenes were replaced with a placeholder card with an explanation of what was removed on a background image of a koala crying.&lt;ref name="PolygonCensor"/&gt;

Discussing the situation, Stone said he had been told changes were required for the game to be released and that he and Parker inserted the placeholder images so the censorship would not be hidden. He called the censorship a double standard that the pair resisted, and said he felt it did not ruin the game and the cards allowed them to mock the changes.&lt;ref name="GuardianCensor2"/&gt; A post-release user-created game modification was released for the Microsoft Windows version that disabled the censorship.&lt;ref name="EscapistMod"/&gt;

''South Park: The Stick of Truth'' received positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="GuardianCensor"/&gt; Aggregating review website [[Metacritic]] provides a score of 85 out of 100 from 48 critics for the Microsoft Windows version,&lt;ref name="MCPC"/&gt; 85 out of 100 from 31 critics for the PlayStation 3 version,&lt;ref name="MCPS3"/&gt; and 82 out of 100 from 33 critics for the Xbox 360 version.&lt;ref name="MCX360"/&gt;

The game was considered a successful adaptation of licensed material to a video game, with critics describing it as one of the most faithful video game adaptations ever, such that moving the player-character was like walking on the set of the show.&lt;ref name="RevGI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; [[GamesRadar]] said that ''The Stick of Truth'' was to ''South Park'' as ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' was to the ''Batman'' franchise in terms of reverence to the source material while breaking new ground in video games. They praised the "open-world South Park to explore, with a solid 12–14 hours of inside jokes, obscure references, and humor that pulls from 17 TV seasons' worth of social commentary and offensive humor."&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Esacapist"/&gt; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' said that the game contained so many references to the show's history that it made ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'' appear sparse.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; [[Destructoid]] said that the ability to walk around the detailed town provided a sense of wonderment similar to exploring [[The Simpsons]]{{'}} home town in ''[[The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield|Virtual Springfield]]''.&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt; The visual translation was highlighted as a significant component of the game's success, appearing indistinguishable from an episode of the show and providing a consistent aesthetic that remained faithful to the series while being original to gaming.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt; Some reviewers said that the art style was occasionally detrimental, obscuring objects and prompts, and that repetitive use of animations grew stale over the course of the game.&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; ''Computer and Video Games'' said that Obsidian had built a game world that seemed as though it had always existed.&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt;

Reviewers consistently highlighted its comedic achievement.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' said it is frequently hilarious, ranking it among the best comedic games ever released.&lt;ref name="RevGI"/&gt; IGN praised ''The Stick of Truth'' for its witty and intelligent satire of the role-playing genre, while others said that as well as being consistently funny, the game was suitably boisterous, shocking, provocative, self-effacing, and fearless in its desire to offend.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; Many reviewers agreed that much of the content was more appealing to ''South Park'' fans; some jokes are lost on the uninitiated but others said that enough context was provided for most jokes to be funny regardless of players' familiarity with the source material.&lt;ref name="SettingJoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt; IGN said that it is the game ''South Park'' fans have always wanted,&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; but some reviewers said that without the ''South Park'' license, the game's shallowness would be more obvious.&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt;

Combat received a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, and others said that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt; Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals.&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; Some reviewers said that a lack of depth made combat gradually become repetitive;&lt;ref name="SettingJoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PolygonReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, by the end of the game the battles can become routine.&lt;ref name="SettingJoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt; [[Joystiq]] stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation.&lt;ref name="SettingJoy"/&gt; Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long.&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents.&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun.&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt; The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing,&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt; and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available.&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt; Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.&lt;ref name="SettingJoy"/&gt;

IGN said that the difference between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting rather than their quality,&lt;ref name="DestructoidReview"/&gt; while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple.&lt;ref name="GSpotReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CVG"/&gt; Reviewers said that many of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamesRadarReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"/&gt;

[[File:Pot-pourri en vaisseau en troisième grandeur - Vessel potpourri vase, third size - 1760 - Sèvres - Louvre - OA 10965.jpg|thumb|''Pot-pourri en vaisseau en troisième grandeur'' – Vessel potpourri vase, third size – 1760, Louvre]]

'''''Pot pourri à vaisseau''''' or '''''pot pourri en navire''''' ("pot-pourri holder as a vessel/ship") is the shape used for a number of [[pot-pourri]] vases in the form of masted ships, first produced between the late 1750s to the early 1760s by the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres manufactory]] near Paris.  The colours and details of the painted decoration vary between examples, as is typical of Sèvres porcelain, and one example is on a later gilt wood stand.  The [[openwork]] lid lifts off to allow refilling of the [[pot-pourri]]. The shape was eventually produced in two or three versions, at slightly different sizes. It was first designed in 1757, probably by [[Jean-Claude Duplessis]] (c. 1695–1774), the artistic director of the factory. The first surviving finished example dates to 1759.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre; Metropolitan; Royal Collection; Frick; two sizes per Sassoon, 49, others say three&lt;/ref&gt;  Another name for them is ''vaisseau à mat'' (masted ship).

These vases are considered to be one of the most famous models introduced by the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres; patrons such as [[Madame de Pompadour]] and her brother the [[Abel François Poisson|Marquis de Marigny]] collected the form. Among the largest vessels produced by the factory, these vases were extremely difficult to fire; the multiple openwork piercings in the body weakened the overall structure, and they tended to collapse in the [[kiln]]. Consequently, only about twelve were ever produced, ten of which survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre; Metropolitan; Royal Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape derives from the [[Nef (metalwork)|nef]], a table decoration in the form of a ship, usually of precious metals, used since medieval times. The arms of the City of Paris also showed a ship, and the vases may reflect this.  The vase would have held potpourri used to perfume a room. Eighteenth-century ladies made their own, experimenting with various ingredients and sometimes blending essences for as long as nine years. The vases were made to be sold with other vases of different shapes to form a [[garniture]] to place on a [[mantelpiece]] or side table.  The main background colours in different examples range from pink to green and dark blue, and the subjects of the main painted spaces from naval subjects after Dutch painting to [[chinoiserie]] genre scenes.  The paintings on the rear are mostly flowers, or other inanimate objects, such as the garnish of marine still-life on the Walters' example.

==Versions and copies==
Sèvres still have some of the moulds, and a plaster model which incorporates features from both sizes.  At Sèvres the shape evolved from a vase with no lid, the ''cuvette à masques'', produced from 1754 (earliest example, at [[Houghton Hall]]), and the shape of the ''pot pourri à vaisseau'' was also used in an adaptation as a lidded [[tureen]] with a stand, the ''terrine gondole'' from at least 1757 (two in the [[Hofburg Palace]] in Vienna), and a different ''pot pourri gondole''.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Sèvres porcelain with English collectors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is demonstrated by the presence of all ten known examples of this shape of vase in English collections by the mid-nineteenth century.  Today there is one in France, five in the UK and four in the US. The shape was copied, usually in somewhat simplified form, by some other manufacturers, notably the English firm [[Mintons]], who were commissioned to make a replica by [[Georgina Ward, Countess of Dudley]], when her husband sold his original in the 1880s; this is the example now in the Getty Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, 52, though [[Sotheby's]] gave a somewhat different history when they [http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.113.html/2005/fine-european-ceramics-glass-l05732 sold the Minton Museum's example] in 2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;gallery widths="200px" heights="200px"&gt;

==Surviving vases==

=== ''[[Waddesdon Manor]], [[Buckinghamshire]], England'' ===
[[File:Sèvres porcelain manufactory, Pot-pourri vases, 1761 at Waddesdon Manor (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Waddesdon Manor]]'s three vases, about 1761.]]
[[File:Pot-pourri vase, c. 1761, and urns, Sevres porcelain - Waddesdon Manor - Buckinghamshire, England - DSC07651.jpg|thumb|One of the Waddesdon vases in a [[garniture]], as they would normally have been displayed.]]

Of the ten surviving ship vases, three can be seen at [[Waddesdon Manor]] in Buckinghamshire. Waddesdon Manor was built in the 1880s by [[Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild]], a keen collector of French decorative arts. The bleu céleste vase was Baron Ferdinand’s first important purchase as a collector in 1861. He acquired it from the dealer Alexander Barker and it was said that the vase had been a gift to an ancestor of the Prince of Salerno by [[Louis XV]].&lt;ref&gt;Svend Eriksen, The James A. de Rothschild Collection at Waddesdon Manor: Sèvres Porcelain (Office du Livre, 1968), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  The front panel shows a battle scene, while the back is decorated with flowers, possibly by [[Jean-Louis Morin (porcelain painter)|Jean-Louis Morin]]. The battle scene shows two armies, one side in white coats and the other in blue. It likely refers to the last three years of the [[Seven Years' War]] that saw France allied with Austria and Spain against Britain and Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, Sèvres Porcelain, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Waddesdon’s second ship vase has a dark blue ground colour with caillouté decoration, trellis-work and scrolls in gold. The two panels were probably painted by André-Vincent Vielliard. The front panel shows peasants seated around a table outside a tavern. This scene was adapted from a detail of the painting Fête de Village by [[David Teniers the Younger]].  Baron Ferdinand purchased this vase from the collection of the 5th Earl Spencer.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, Sèvres Porcelain, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ground colour of the third ship vase is a rare ‘petit vert’ which was only produced for a short time around 1760.  It is believed to have been purchased from a ‘Mrs Yorke of Torquay’.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, Sèvres Porcelain, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;   The dock-side scene was possibly painted by Jean-Louis Morin, while the back panel is decorated with flowers.  The architectural base of this vase is unique and differs from all other known ship vases.  The vase was probably designed to be mounted on its existing ormolu plinth in which an ormolu dolphin is interposed between each pair of triglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;Eriksen, Sèvres Porcelain, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  

All three vases were produced around 1761 and are now owned by the [[National Trust]].
&lt;ref&gt;Waddesdon Manor&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''[[Louvre]], Paris'' ===
Jean-Claude Duplessis (circa 1695-1774), painted by Charles-Nicolas Dodin (1734-1803), c. 1760 in pink and green, with a [[chinoiserie]] scene in the main panel, after a painting by [[François Boucher]].  Once in the bedchamber of [[Madame de Pompadour]] at the Hôtel d'Évreux, which is today the [[Elysée Palace]]. Soft-paste porcelain, H. 37&amp;nbsp;cm; W. 35&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Louvre&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Walters Art Gallery]], [[Baltimore]], Maryland, USA.

H: 15 5/16 in. (38.9 cm), 1764. Dark-blue main colour, with sailors packing fish in front main panel, and a maritime trophy on the rear. Provenance: Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1928, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.&lt;ref&gt;Walters&lt;/ref&gt;  The feet are later, in gilt-wood.&lt;ref&gt;Sassoon, 52&lt;/ref&gt;  This differs from most examples in the form of the openwork in the upper part, here with long vertical slits rather than the complicated pattern with units of a tear shape and crescent below on most examples. 

[[File:Potpourri vase (pot-pourri à vaisseau) MET DP156522 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], c. 1757–58]]

=== ''[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York'' ===
Main colour pink, painted with cherubs in the main panel. Designed by Jean-Claude Duplessis (active 1748–74) and dated about 1757–58, this is in soft-paste porcelain, with Sèvres pink the main colour.  With an overall dimension of 44.8 x 37.5&amp;nbsp;cm it was gifted by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1958, and is believed to be the vase in the ownership of Louis-Joseph de Bourbon, Prince de Condé (where it formed a ''garniture'' with two of the famous elephant-head vases) and passed down after the French Revolution to Sir Charles Mills, Baronet and eventually to the Lords Hillingdon (in 1888).  Notable marks include crossed Ls, and E. below, in blue on the underside with the factory mark and year letter.&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''[[Royal Collection]], UK'' ===
"Soft-paste porcelain, bleu lapis and green ground overlaid with gilded œil-de-perdrix decoration, further gilding and gilt bronze", with interlaced LLs enclosing the date-letter F, c. 1758/9.  Dimensions, excluding stand, 45.2 x 37.8 x 19.3&amp;nbsp;cm.  In 2017 it was in the Green Drawing Room of [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;Royal Collection&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquired by George IV, the vase in the Royal Collection is the largest of the three models of this shape produced at Sèvres, and is decorated with two ground colours, green and dark blue. The front reserve depicts a genre scene taken from an unknown source, inspired by [[David Teniers the Younger]] (1610–90). The ends of the vase are in the form of a bowsprit, projecting from the jaws of a marine head, and at the masthead is a fluttering white pennant, patterned with fleurs-de-lis.  The vase was purchased in 1759 at the end-of-year sale at Versailles by Madame de Pompadour for 960 livres. Madame de Pompadour is known to have owned at three examples of this model (including those now in the Louvre and Royal Collection); these formed important components of her sumptuously appointed apartments.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Collection; Metropolitan; Waddesdon Manor&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''[[Wallace Collection]], London'' ===
Acquired by [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|Richard Seymour-Conway]], the [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|4th Marquess of Hertford]], by 1865, and possibly from the collection of [[Marie-Gabriel-Florent-Auguste de Choiseul-Gouffier|Marie-Gabriel-Florens-Auguste]], comte de Choiseul, known as [[Marie-Gabriel-Florent-Auguste de Choiseul-Gouffier|Choiseul-Gouffier]], this is the third of the ship-shaped vases designed by [[Jean-Claude Chambellan Duplessis|Jean-Claude Duplessis père]] (active 1748–74) in the 1750s. The naval theme is emphasised by the faceted bowsprits in the mouths of the marine masks and is a reminder that at this time the French navy was involved in the [[Seven Years’ War]] (1756–63).  The Wallace Collection example dates from 1761, composed of [[soft-paste porcelain]], is painted and gilded, and is 44.1 x 36.9&amp;nbsp;cm.

==In Malay==
Loanwords from Tamil, mainly exist in cuisine, like Chinese and unlike Sanskrit. It mainly entered the lexicon of Classical Malay (and by extension, its Modern and Indonesian variants) with the immigration of South Indian traders who settled around the [[Strait of Malacca]].

==In Sinhala==

[[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] words of Tamil origin came about as part of the more than 2,000 years of language interactions between Sinhala and Tamil in the island of Sri Lanka.

===In Sinhala words===
In the following list, Tamil words are romanised in accordance with Tamil spelling. This results in seeming discrepancies in voicing between Sinhala words and their Tamil counterparts. Sinhala borrowing however has taken place on the basis of the sound of the Tamil words; thus, the word ampalam, [ambalam], logically results in the Sinhala spelling ambalama, and so forth. However, the Tamil language used here for comparison is Tamil as spoken in Sri Lanka.

'''The Secret Book of Gnomes''' is a series of books about Gnomes designed for children. They contain fictional stories and guides about how [[Gnome]]s live in harmony with their environment, such as what a Gnome has in his first aid kit and how a Gnome's house is built. The books were written by the Dutch author [[Wil Huygen]] and illustrator [[Rien Poortvliet]], though they have claimed that parts were written by a Gnome called David. Those authors also created another series about Gnomes entitled [[Gnomes_(book)|The Gnomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= TV: Animated 'Gnomes'and Saturn Rendezvous|work= The New York Times|date=1980-11-11|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0A1FF83D5E12728DDDA80994D9415B8084F1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Wil%20Huygen&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-14 | first=John J. | last=O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Snotgurgles Were Enemies|work= The New York Times|date=1977-12-25|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10E14FF3B5416768FDDAC0A94DA415B878BF1D3&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=Wil%20Huygen&amp;st=cse|accessdate=2010-08-14 | first=Richard R. | last=Lingeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
That later was used as a basis for the television shows [[David the Gnome]] and [[Wisdom of the Gnomes]] by [[BRB Internacional]].

The [[defendant]] challenged a conviction for drug related offenses for growing marijuana on the basis that the area searched by the police was within the "[[curtilage]]" of his home in [[Palm Beach County, Florida]].  He specifically argued that because the fence surrounding his home was unfinished in the direction where the drugs were discovered that the area was still within the "curtilage."  The Court of Appeals did not agree, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he evidence that the curtilage that defines the property that was in question here is enclosed in the fencing around the home and [[taxidermist]] building, even if the fence may not be complete on the north, and perhaps east sides of the property. It is true in a narrow definition of the term perimeter that means all the way around. But it seems to me it isn't necessary that the fence be without any kind of breech [sic] in order for the curtilage to be defined for the purpose that we are talking about here. I think we have to be practical about the thing, and the areas where the fence may not be complete around his property is really not an area that is in question in connection with the investigation that was made by these officers.&lt;ref&gt;''Hatch'', 931 F.2d at 1481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also central to the court's findings was the presence of a barn, pig pens and several other obstacles found in the thirty yards (28 m) between the house and the drug crop.

The '''Windows System Assessment Tool''' ('''WinSAT''') is a module of [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows 10]] that is available in the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] under ''Performance Information and Tools'' (except in [[Windows 8.1]] &amp; [[Windows 10]]). It measures various performance characteristics and capabilities of the hardware it is running on and reports them as a '''Windows Experience Index (WEI)''' score. The WEI includes five subscores: processor, memory, 2D graphics, 3D graphics, and disk; the basescore is equal to the lowest of the subscores and is '''not''' an average of the subscores.&lt;ref name="Softpedia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows 7 WEI Scores 6.0 through 7.9 Explained|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-7-WEI-Scores-6-0-through-7-9-Explained-172277.shtml |publisher=Softpedia |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft_Perfect_Score"&gt;{{cite web |title=Earning the top Windows Experience Index score |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/achieving-a-perfect-windows-experience-index-score-in-windows-7 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; WinSAT reports WEI scores on a scale from 1.0 to 5.9 for Windows Vista,&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2006/09/22/windows-experience-index-an-in-depth-look.aspx Vista Team Blog : Windows Experience Index: An In-Depth Look]&lt;/ref&gt; 7.9 for Windows 7,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/239713/how_to_max_out_your_windows_performance_for_1000.html |title = How to Max Out Your Windows Performance for $1000 | author = Marco Chiappetta |publisher = [[PC World]] | date = September 8, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 9.9 for Windows 8 and Windows 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url  = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh825488.aspx |title = WinSAT Comprehensive | date = October 20, 2013 | publisher = MSDN | accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WEI enables users to match their computer hardware performance with the performance requirements of software. For example, the [[Windows Aero|Aero]] [[graphical user interface]] will not automatically be enabled unless the system has a WEI score of 3 or higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Full screen previews have got disabled. How do I re-enable them?  |url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/full-screen-previews-have-got-disabled-how-do-i-re/d44193c0-7e51-4a2f-8ec0-4ac115c710c0 |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Is the Windows Experience Index |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-the-Windows-Experience-Index |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WEI can also be used to show which part of a system would be expected to provide the greatest increase in performance when upgraded. For example, a computer with the lowest subscore being its memory, would benefit more from a [[RAM]] upgrade than adding a faster hard drive (or any other component).&lt;ref name="Microsoft_Perfect_Score"/&gt;

Detailed raw performance information, like actual disk bandwidth, can be obtained by invoking &lt;code&gt;winsat&lt;/code&gt; from the command line. This also allows only specific tests to be re-run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/winsat-command-line-utility Winsat Command-Line Utility]&lt;/ref&gt; Obtaining the WEI score from the command line is done invoking &lt;code&gt;winsat formal&lt;/code&gt;, which also updates the value stored in &lt;code&gt;%systemroot%\Performance\WinSAT\DataStore&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/how-can-i-run-windows-system-assessment-tool-winsat-update-directly-command-line How can I run the Windows System Assessment Tool (WinSAT) update directly from a command line?]&lt;/ref&gt; (The XML files stored there can be easily hacked to report fake performance values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howtogeek.com/71500/stupid-geek-tricks-hacking-the-windows-experience-index/ Stupid Geek Tricks: Hacking the Windows Experience Index]&lt;/ref&gt;) The WEI is also available to applications through an [[API]], so they can configure themselves as a function of hardware performance, taking advantage of its capabilities without becoming unacceptably slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows Experience Index: Overview |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc507870.aspx |publisher=Microsoft TechNet |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windows Experience Index score is not displayed in [[Windows 8.1]] and onwards because the [[graphical user interface]] for WinSAT was removed in these versions of Windows, although the [[command line]] winsat tool still exists and operates correctly along with a final score when launching the command "shell:games".&lt;ref name="WEI killed"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cnet.com/how-to/find-your-windows-experience-index-scores-in-windows-8-1/| title=Find your Windows Experience Index scores in Windows 8.1 | author = Ed Rhee |

==History==
At the 2003 [[Game Developers Conference]] Dean Lester, Microsoft's General Manager of Windows Graphics and Gaming, stated in an interview with [[GameSpot]] that Microsoft intended to focus on improvements to the PC gaming experience as part of a new gaming initiative for the next version of Windows, [[Windows Vista]], then codenamed "Longhorn." Lester stated that as part of this initiative the operating system would include a [[Games for Windows#Games Explorer|games folder that would centralize settings pertinent to gamers]] and, among other features, [[Windows Display Driver Model|display driver streamlining]], [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Parental controls|parental controls for games]] and the [[Games for Windows#Tray and Play|ability to start a Windows game directly from optical media]] during installation—in a manner similar to games designed for a [[video game console]]. Microsoft would also require a new method of displaying system requirements on retail packaging for Windows games with a rating system that would categorize games based on a numerical system.&lt;ref name="GDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-big-pc-plans/1100-2912498/ |title=Microsoft's big PC plans |last=Parker |first=Sam |date=March 10, 2003 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, Lester expanded further on Microsoft's intentions by stating that the company would work with hardware manufacturers to create PCs for Windows Vista that used a "level system" to designate the performance and capabilities of a system's hardware and that [[Xbox 360]] peripherals would be fully compatible with the operating system.&lt;ref name="LonghornXbox"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-talks-longhorn-xna-and-xbox-2/1100-6108247/ |title=Microsoft talks Longhorn, XNA, and Xbox 2 |date=September 22, 2004 |author=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Windows Experience Index feature in Windows Vista relies on measurements taken with WinSAT to provide an accurate assessment of a system's capabilities—these capabilities are presented in the form of a rating, where a higher rating indicates better performance.

Preliminary design elements created for Microsoft by Robert Stein in 2004 suggest that WinSAT was intended to rate a user's hardware during the [[out-of-box experience]];&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/rs3art/304021764/in/set-72157594393542938 |title=Aurora for OOBE |last=Stein |first=Robert |work=[[Flickr]] |date=November 22, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is a design decision that would be retained for the operating system's [[release to manufacturing]].&lt;ref name="WinSAT2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/cpa101_wh06.ppt |title=Windows Vista System Requirements and WinSAT |last=Russell |first=Richard |date=2006 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |format=PPT |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Windows Hardware Engineering Conference]] of 2005, Microsoft formally unveiled the existence of WinSAT and presented it as a technology not only for games, but one that would allow Windows Vista to make decisions, such as whether to enable [[compositing window manager|desktop composition]], based on a machine's hardware capabilities.&lt;ref name="LongShort"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-long-and-short-of-longhorns-hardware-requirements/ |title=The long and short of Longhorn's hardware requirements |last=Shultz |first=Greg |date=June 30, 2005 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[TechRepublic]] |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Muench"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mikehall/archive/2005/04/26/412402.aspx |title=WinHEC : Chris Muench Report for Day 2 - Everything has two sides |last=Muench |first=Chris |date=April 26, 2005 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=MSDN Blogs |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WinSAT2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/8/f/98f3fe47-dfc3-4e74-92a3-088782200fe7/TWAR05002_WinHEC05.ppt |title=System Performance Assessment Tools for Windows 'Longhorn' |last=Russell |first=Richard |date=2005 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |format=PPT |accessdate=April 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WinSAT would remain a key focus throughout development of the operating system before its release to manufacturing.&lt;ref name="WinSAT2006"/&gt;

==Tests==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
WinSAT in Windows Vista and Windows 7 performs the following tests:
* Direct3D 9 Aero Assessment
* Direct3D 9 Batch Assessment
* Direct3D 9 [[alpha compositing|Alpha Blend]] Assessment
* Direct3D 9 [[texture mapping|Texture]] Load Assessment
* Direct3D 9 [[arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] Assessment
* Direct3D 10 Batch Assessment
* Direct3D 10 Alpha Blend Assessment
* Direct3D 10 Texture Load Assessment
* Direct3D 10 ALU Assessment
* Direct3D 10 Geometry Assessment
* Direct3D 10 Constant Buffer Assessment
* Windows Media Decoding Performance
* Windows Media Encoding Performance
* [[Central processing unit|CPU]] Performance
* [[Computer storage|Memory]] Performance
* [[Hard disk|Disk]] Performance (includes devices such as [[Solid-state drive]]s)

While running, the tests show only a progress bar and a "working" background animation.  Aero Glass is deactivated on Windows Vista and Windows 7 during testing so the tool can properly assess the graphics card and CPU.

In Windows 8, WinSAT runs under the maintenance scheduler every week. The default schedule is 1am on Sundays. The maintenance scheduler collates various OS tasks into a schedule so the computer is not being randomly interrupted by the individual tasks. The scheduler wakes the computer from sleep, runs all the scheduled tasks and then puts the computer back to sleep. During this weekly task, WinSAT runs long enough to detect if there have been any hardware changes. If so, then the tests are run again. If not, then WinSAT simply ends as the existing scores must be valid.

WinSAT cannot perform the above tests when a laptop is battery-operated.

The '''''Yongle Encyclopedia''''' or '''''Yongle Dadian''''' ({{zh|t=永樂大典|s=永乐大典|p=Yǒnglè Dàdiǎn|w=Yung-lo Ta-tien|l=Great Canon of Yongle}}) is a partially lost Chinese ''[[leishu]]'' [[encyclopedia]] commissioned by the [[Yongle Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1403 and completed by 1408.  Its sheer scope and size made it the world's largest paper-based general encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Encyclopedias and Dictionaries|edition=15th |year=2007 |volume=18|pages=257–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Although known for his military achievements, the [[Yongle Emperor]] was also an intellectual who enjoyed reading.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Christos, Lauren. "The Yongle Dadian: The Origin, Destruction, Dispersal, and Reclamation of a Chinese Cultural Treasure." ''Journal of Library and Information Science'' 36, no. 1 (April 2010): 85. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://140.122.104.2/ojs/index.php/jlis/article/view/538&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; His love for research led him to develop the idea of categorizing literary works into a reference [[encyclopedia]], in order to preserve rare books and simplify research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Jianying, Huo. "Emperor Yongle." ''China Today'', April 2004, 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Tsai, Shih-Shan Henry. Perpetual  The Ming Emperor Yongle, University of Washington Press, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3444272&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental to this undertaking was Emperor Yongle’s own transformation of the [[Hanlin Academy]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Prior to his reign, the [[Hanlin Academy]] was responsible for various clerical tasks, such as drafting proclamations and edicts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Emperor Yongle, decided to elevate the status of the [[Hanlin Academy]], and began selecting only the highest ranking recruits for the academy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clerical duties were relegated to the Imperial officers, while the [[Hanlin Academy]], now full of elite scholars, began working on literary projects for the Emperor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Development==
The ''Yongle Dadian'' was commissioned by the [[Yongle Emperor]] (r. 1402–24) and completed in 1408. [[File:Yongle.jpg|thumb|Yongle Emperor]]In 1404, a year after the work was commissioned, a team of 100 scholars, mostly from the [[Hanlin Academy]], completed a manuscript called ''[[A Complete Work of Literature]].''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]] rejected this work and insisted on adding other volumes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1405, under [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]]’s command, the number of scholars rose to 2,169. Scholars were sent all over [[China]] to find books and expand the [[encyclopedia]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]] assigned his personal advisor, Dao Yan, a monk, and Liu Jichi, the deputy minister of punishment, as co-editors of the encyclopedia, supporting [[Yao Guangxiao]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Tsai, Shih-Shan Henry. Perpetual  The Ming Emperor Yongle, University of Washington Press, 2011. ProQuest Ebook Central, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.oca.ucsc.edu/lib/ucsc/detail.action?docID=3444272&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholars spent four years compiling the ''[[leishu]]'' encyclopedia, under the leadership of general editor [[Yao Guangxiao]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Endymion |authorlink=Endymion Wilkinson |title=Chinese History: A Manual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERnrQq0bsPYC&amp;pg=PA604 |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |isbn=978-0-674-00249-4 |pages=604–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholars incorporated 8,000 texts from ancient times through the early [[Ming dynasty]]. Many subjects were covered, including [[agriculture]], [[art]], [[astronomy]], [[drama]], [[geology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[medicine]], [[natural sciences]], [[religion]] and [[technology]], as well as descriptions of unusual natural events.&lt;ref name=WDL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Yongle Encyclopedia|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3019/|publisher=World Digital Library|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia was completed in 1408&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; at the [[Guozijian]] in [[Nanjing]] (now [[Nanjing University]]). It comprised 22,937 manuscript rolls&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yongle dadian (Chinese encyclopaedia)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/654973/Yongle-dadian|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=9 May 2012|author=Kathleen Kuiper|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=31 Aug 2006}} ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]]''&lt;/ref&gt; or chapters, in 11,095 volumes, occupying roughly 40 cubic meters (1400&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and using 370 million [[Chinese characters]].&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=陈红彦 |title= 国家图书馆《永乐大典》收藏史话 |date=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226010714/http://www.nlc.gov.cn/old2008/service/wjls/pdf/04/04_04_a4b7c3.pdf |archivedate=December 26, 2016 |publisher=[[National Library of China]] |url=http://www.nlc.gov.cn/old2008/service/wjls/pdf/04/04_04_a4b7c3.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to include all that had been written on the [[Chinese classics|Confucian canon]], as well as all history, philosophy, arts and sciences. It was a massive collation of excerpts and works from the entirety of Chinese literature and knowledge. [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]] was so pleased with the finished encyclopedia, that he named it after his reign, and personally wrote a lengthy preface highlighting the importance of preserving the works.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Yongle Encyclopedia.jpg|thumb|The Yongle Encyclopedia, in 2014, on display at [[National Library of China|The National Library of China.]]]]
The encyclopedia’s physical appearance differed from any other Chinese encyclopedias of the time.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Campbell, Ducan. "The Huntington Library’s Volume of the Yongle Encyclopaedia (Yongle Dadian 湛樂댕듕): A Bibliographical and Historical Note." ''East Asian History'', no. 42 (March 2018): 1. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.eastasianhistory.org/42/campbell&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It was bigger in size, used special paper, and was bound in a “wrapped back” or ([[包背裝]] bao bei zhuang) style.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Clunas, Craig, and Jessica Harrison-Hall. ''The BP Exhibition: Ming: 50 Years That Changed China''. The British Museum, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of red ink for titles and authors, an ink exclusively reserved for the emperor, helped to confirm that the volumes were of royal production.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Each volume was protected by a hard-cover which was wrapped in yellow [[silk]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The [[encyclopedia]] was not arranged by subject, like other encyclopedias, instead it was arranged by [[洪武正韻]] (Hongwu zhengyun) a system in which characters are ordered [[Phonetics|phonetically]]/rhythmically.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The use of this system helped the reader find specific entries with ease.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although book printing already existed in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]], the Yongle Encyclopedia was exclusively handwritten.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Each handwritten entry was a collection of existing literature, some of which derived from rare and delicate texts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The importance of the Yongle Encyclopedia was the preservation of such texts, and the vast number of subjects it covered.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Reception ==
At the end of the [[Ming dynasty]], scholars began to question [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]]’s motives for not commissioning more copies of the [[encyclopedia]], instead of keeping them in storage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some scholars, like Sun Chengze, a Qin scholar, theorized that [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]] used the literary project for political reasons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the time, [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] were refusing to take civil service exams, or participate in any imperial duties, due to [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]]'s violent usurpation of the throne.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]]’s literary undertaking did attract the attention of these scholars, who eventually joined the project.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Because [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]] did not want a strictly [[Confucianism|Confucian]] point of view for the encyclopedia, Non-Confucian scholars were also included, and contributed to the [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism|Daoism]], and [[Divination]] sections of the encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The inclusion of these subjects intensified the scrutiny against [[Yongle Emperor|Emperor Yongle]] amongst [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucians]] who believed the encyclopedia was nothing but “''wheat and chaff''".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, despite the varied opinions, the encyclopedia is widely regarded as a priceless contribution in preserving a wide range of China's historic works, many of which would be lost otherwise.

==Disappearance==
The ''Yongle Dadian'' was not [[printing|printed]] for the general public, because the treasury had run out of funds when it was completed in 1408. It was placed in [[Wenyuan Ge]] (文渊阁) in Nanjin after completed until 1421 Yongle Empire moved the capital to Beijing, along with the Yongle Dadian, and placed it in the [[Forbidden City]] in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauren Christos|date=2010-01-04|title=The Yongle Dadian: The Origin, Destruction, Dispersal and Reclamation of a Chinese Cultural Treasure|url=http://140.122.104.2/ojs/index.php/jlis/article/view/538|journal=圖書館學與資訊科學|language=en|volume=36|issue=1|issn=2224-1574}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1557, during the reign of the [[Jiajing Emperor]], the encyclopedia was narrowly saved from a fire that burnt down three palaces in the [[Forbidden City]]. A manuscript copy was commissioned by Jiajing Emperor in 1562 and completed in 1567.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; The original copy was lost afterwards. There are three major hypotheses for its disappearance, but no conclusion was made:

*Destroyed in late Ming Dynasty. [[Li Zicheng]], rebel leader, in 1644 overthrew the Ming Dynasty and took over the Ming capital, Beijing. A few months later, he was defeated by the coalition of [[Wu Sangui]] and [[Dorgon]]. Li burned the Forbidden City when he withdrew from Beijing.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.ifeng.com/a/20170311/50771110_0.shtml|title=《永乐大典》 正本陪葬了嘉靖帝？|last=Lin|first=Guang|date=2017-02-28|work=《北京日报》|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yongle Dadian may have been destroyed in the fire.
*Buried with Jiajing Emperor. The time when the Jiajing Emperor was buried was very close to the time of completion of the manuscript copy. Jiajing Emperor died in December 1566, but was buried three months later, in March 1567.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One possibility is that they were waiting for the manuscript to be completed.
*Burned in [[Palace of Heavenly Purity|Qianqing Palace]] fire.

The original manuscript of the ''Yongle Dadian'' was almost completely lost by the end of the Ming dynasty,&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; but 90 percent of the 1567 manuscript survived until the [[Second Opium War]] in the [[Qing dynasty]]. In 1860, the [[Battle of Palikao|Anglo-French invasion of Beijing]] resulted in extensive burning and looting of the city,&lt;ref name=FootWoolf2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foot|first1=Sarah|authorlink1=Sarah Foot|last2=Woolf|first2=Daniel R.|last3=Robinson|first3=Chase F.|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing: Volume 2: 400-1400 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzmBxU39PGMC&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-923642-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the British and French soldiers taking large portions of the manuscript as souvenirs.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt; 5,000 volumes remained by 1875, less than half of the original, which dwindled to 800 by 1894. During the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and the 1900 [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] [[Battle of Beijing (1900)|occupation of Beijing]], allied soldiers took hundreds of volumes, and many were destroyed in the [[Hanlin Academy]] fire. Only 60 volumes remained in Beijing.&lt;ref name=Wilkinson/&gt;

==Current status==
Fewer than 400 volumes survive today,&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt; comprising about 800 chapters (rolls), or 3.5 percent of the original work.&lt;ref name=FootWoolf2012/&gt; The most complete collection is kept at the [[National Library of China]] in Beijing, which holds 221 volumes.&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt; The next largest collection is at the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], which holds 62 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npm.gov.tw/english/exhbition/ease0101/selec04.htm Yung-lo ta-tien (Vast Documents of the Yung-lo Era)] ''[[National Palace Museum]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

51 volumes are in the United Kingdom held at the [[British Library]], the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]], the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] of the [[University of London]], and [[Cambridge University Library]]; The [[Library of Congress]] of the United States holds 41 volumes; [[Cornell University Library]] has 6 volumes; and 5 volumes are held in various libraries in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://china.org.cn/english/PP-e/31248.htm |title=Experts Urge Collectors To Share World's Earliest Encyclopedia |work=Xinhua News Agency|date=April 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holdings of Yong Le Da Dian in United Kingdom Libraries |first=David |last=Helliwell |publisher=Bodleian Library|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/users/djh/serica/oldchinesebooks/YongleEurope.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
