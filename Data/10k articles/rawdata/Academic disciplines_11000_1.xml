      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5731">The '''[https://www.uaf.edu/anlc/index.xml Alaska Native Language Center]''', established in 1972 in [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is a research center focusing on the research and documentation of the Native languages of [[Alaska]]. It publishes grammars, dictionaries, folklore collections and research materials, as well as hosting an extensive archive of written materials relating to [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo]], [[Northern Athabaskan languages|North Athabaskan]] and related languages. The Center provides training, materials and consultation for educators, researchers and others working with [[Alaska Native languages]]. The closely affiliated [[Alaska Native Language Program]] offers degrees in [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Yup'ik]] and [[Inupiat language|Inupiaq]] at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], and works toward the documentation and preservation of these languages.

==Language map==
In 1974, Michael Krauss published a language map of Alaska, which he later updated in 1982.  It has remained the standard since then.  In the summer of 2011, the Alaska Native Language Center made an update to Krauss's map.&lt;ref name="Alaska Dispatch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/alaskas-indigenous-languages-map-gets-updated-first-time-30-years | title= Alaska's indigenous languages map gets updated, for first time in 30 years | author = Ben Anderson | date= 2011-07-15 | accessdate= 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the biggest reasons for this update was that some of the names of these languages had changed over the years.  While there was not a dramatic change in the updated map, the new edition is entirely digital.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples and Languages of Alaska"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alaskool.org/language/languagemap/index.html | title = Indigenous People and Languages of Alaska | author = Gary Holton | year= 2011 | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Applied linguistics''' is an interdisciplinary field of linguistics which identifies, investigates, and offers solutions to language-related real-life problems. Some of the academic fields related to applied [[linguistics]] are [[education]], [[psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication research]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]].

{{Linguistics}}

== Domain ==
Applied linguistics is an [[interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary field]] of linguistics. Major branches of applied linguistics include [[bilingualism]] and [[multilingualism]], [[conversation analysis]], [[contrastive linguistics]], [[Sign language#Linguistics of sign|sign linguistics]], [[language assessment]], [[literacy|literacies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[language pedagogy]], [[second language acquisition]], [[language planning]] and [[language policy|policy]], [[interlinguistics]], [[stylistics (literature)|stylistics]], [[pragmatics]], [[forensic linguistics]] and [[translation]].

== Journals ==
Major journals of the field include ''Annual Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Review of Applied Linguistics'', ''International Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''European Journal of Applied Linguistics'', ''Issues in Applied Linguistics'', ''[[Language Learning (journal)|Language Learning]]'', ''Language and Education, TESOL Quarterly'', and ''Linguistics and Education''.

== History ==
The tradition of applied linguistics established itself in part as a response to the narrowing of focus in linguistics with the advent in the late 1950s of [[generative linguistics]], and has always maintained a socially-accountable role, demonstrated by its central interest in language problems.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the field of applied linguistics started from Europe and the United States, the field rapidly flourished in the international context.

Applied linguistics first concerned itself with principles and practices on the basis of linguistics. In the early days, applied linguistics was thought as “linguistics-applied” at least from the outside of the field. In the 1960s, however, applied linguistics was expanded to include language assessment, [[language policy]], and second language acquisition. As early as the 1970s, applied linguistics became a problem-driven field rather than [[theoretical linguistics]], including the solution of language-related problems in the real world. By the 1990s, applied linguistics had broadened including critical studies and multilingualism. Research in applied linguistics was shifted to  "the theoretical and empirical investigation of real world problems in which language is a central issue."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Brumfit. How applied linguistics is the same as any other science, "International Journal of Applied Linguistics", 7(1), 86-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, applied linguistics also began narrowly as the application of insights from structural linguistics—first to the teaching of English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The ''linguistics applied'' approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by [[Leonard Bloomfield]], who developed the foundation for the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1941. In 1946, Applied linguistics became a recognized field of studies in the aforementioned university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/applied-linguistics|title=Applied Linguistics {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established ''Language Learning: A Journal of Applied Linguistics'', the first journal to bear the term ''applied linguistics.'' In the late 1960s, applied linguistics began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues. The new identity was solidified by the creation of the American Association for Applied Linguistics in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Margie Berns and Paul Kei Matsuda. 2006. Applied linguistics: Overview and history. In K. Brown (Ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of language and linguistics'' (2nd ed.), 398-401.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==
The [[International Association of Applied Linguistics]] was founded in France in 1964, where it is better known as Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée, or AILA. AILA has affiliates in more than thirty countries, some of which are listed below.

'''Australia'''
Australian applied linguistics took as its target the applied linguistics of mother tongue teaching and teaching English to immigrants. The Australia tradition shows a strong influence of continental Europe and of the USA, rather than of Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Davies &amp; Catherine Elder.(Eds.). 2004. Handbook of Applied Linguistics. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (ALAA) was established at a national congress of applied linguists held in August 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alaa.org.au/ | title = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia (home page) | date = September 2011 | publisher = Applied Linguistics Association of Australia | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALAA holds a joint annual conference in collaboration with the Association for Applied Linguistics in New Zealand (ALANZ).

'''Canada'''
The Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics / L’Association canadienne de linguistique appliquée (CAAL/ACLA), is an officially bilingual (English and French) scholarly association with approximately 200 members. They produce the ''Canadian Journal of Applied Linguistics'' and hold an annual conference.&lt;ref name="ACLA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian Association of Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.aclacaal.org/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ireland'''
The [[Irish Association for Applied Linguistics]]/Cumann na Teangeolaíochta Feidhmí (IRAAL) was founded in 1975. They produce the journal ''Teanga'', the Irish word for 'language'.&lt;ref name="IRAAL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Association for Applied Linguistics| url=http://www.iraal.ie/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japan'''
In 1982, the Japan Association of Applied Linguistics (JAAL) was established in the Japan Association of College English Teachers (JACET) in order to engage in activities on a more international scale. In 1984, JAAL became an affiliate of the International Association of Applied Linguistics (AILA).[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103202550/http://www.jacet.org/about-e.html]

'''New Zealand'''
The Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand (ALANZ) produces the journal ''New Zealand Studies in Applied Linguistics'' and has been collaborating with the Applied Linguistics Association of Australia in a combined annual conference since 2010, with the Association for Language Testing and Assessment of Australia and New Zealand (ALTAANZ) later joining the now three-way conference collaboration.&lt;ref name="ALANZ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Applied Linguistics Association of New Zealand| url=http://alanz.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

'''South Africa'''
The Southern African Applied Linguistics Association (SAALA) was founded in 1980. There are currently four publications associated with SAALA including the ''Southern African Linguistics and Applied Language Studies Journal'' (SAJALS).&lt;ref name="SAALA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern African Applied Linguistics Association| url=http://www.saala.org.za/|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''
The [[British Association for Applied Linguistics]] (BAAL) was established in 1967. Its mission is "the advancement of education by fostering and promoting, by any lawful charitable means, the study of language use, language acquisition and language teaching and the fostering of interdisciplinary collaboration in this study [...]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.baal.org.uk/constitution.pdf | title = British Association for Applied Linguistics constitution | at = Paragraph 3: "Objects" | work = Public Documents  | date = September 2011  | publisher = British Association for Applied Linguistics | accessdate = 19 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; BAAL hosts an annual conference, as well as many additional smaller conferences and events organised by its Special Interest Groups (SIGs). 

'''United States'''
The [[American Association for Applied Linguistics]] (AAAL) was founded in 1977. AAAL holds an annual conference, usually in March or April, in the United States or Canada.

It includes the arts and sciences of civil debate, [[dialogue]], conversation, and [[persuasion]]. It studies rules of [[inference]], [[logic]], and procedural rules in both [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] and real world settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frans H.

Argumentation is used in [[law]], for example in trials, in preparing an argument to be presented to a court, and in testing the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of certain kinds of evidence. Also, argumentation scholars study the ''post hoc'' rationalizations by which organizational actors try to justify decisions they have made [[Irrationality|irrationally]].

Argumentation is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[description]], and [[narrative mode|narration]]. 

== Key components of argumentation ==
* Understanding and identifying arguments, either explicit or implied, and the goals of the participants in the different types of dialogue.
* Identifying the premises from which conclusions are derived
* Establishing the "[[Philosophical burden of proof|burden of proof]]" – determining who made the initial claim and is thus responsible for providing evidence why his/her position merits acceptance.
* For the one carrying the "burden of proof", the advocate, to marshal [[evidence]] for his/her position in order to convince or force the opponent's acceptance.  The method by which this is accomplished is producing valid, sound, and [[wikt:cogent|cogent]] arguments, devoid of weaknesses, and not easily attacked.
* In a debate, fulfillment of the burden of proof creates a burden of rejoinder. One must try to identify faulty reasoning in the opponent's argument, to attack the reasons/premises of the argument, to provide counterexamples if possible, to identify any [[fallacy|fallacies]], and to show why a valid conclusion cannot be derived from the reasons provided for his/her argument.

== Internal structure of arguments ==
Typically an argument has an internal structure, comprising the following
#a set of assumptions or [[premise]]s
#a method of reasoning or deduction and
#a conclusion or point.

An argument has one or more premises and one conclusion.

Often classical logic is used as the method of reasoning so that the conclusion follows logically from the assumptions or support.  One challenge is that if the set of assumptions is inconsistent then anything can follow logically from inconsistency. Therefore, it is common to insist that the set of assumptions be consistent. It is also good practice to require the set of assumptions to be the minimal set, with respect to set inclusion, necessary to infer the consequent.  Such arguments are called MINCON arguments, short for minimal consistent.  Such argumentation has been applied to the fields of law and medicine. A second school of argumentation investigates abstract arguments, where 'argument' is considered a primitive term, so no internal structure of arguments is taken on account.

In its most common form, argumentation involves an individual and an interlocutor or opponent engaged in dialogue, each contending differing positions and trying to persuade each other. Other types of dialogue in addition to persuasion are [[eristic]], [[information]] seeking, [[inquiry]], [[negotiation]], [[deliberation]], and the [[dialectical]] method (Douglas Walton). The dialectical method was made famous by [[Plato]] and his use of [[Socrates]] critically questioning various characters and historical figures.

==Argumentation and the grounds of knowledge==
Argumentation theory had its origins in [[foundationalism]], a theory of knowledge ([[epistemology]]) in the field of [[philosophy]]. It sought to find the grounds for claims in the forms (logic) and materials (factual laws) of a universal system of knowledge. But argument scholars gradually rejected Aristotle's systematic philosophy and the [[idealism]] in Plato and Kant. They questioned and ultimately discarded the idea that argument premises take their soundness from formal philosophical systems. The field thus broadened.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gronbeck. "From Argument to Argumentation: Fifteen Years of Identity Crisis." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s ''Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation''. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl R. Wallace]]'s seminal essay, "The Substance of Rhetoric: Good Reasons" in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (1963) 44, led many scholars to study "marketplace argumentation" – the ordinary arguments of ordinary people. The seminal essay on marketplace argumentation is Ray Lynn Anderson and C. David Mortensen's "Logic and Marketplace Argumentation" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 53 (1967): 143–150.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph W. Wenzel "Perspectives on Argument." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Zarefsky. "Product, Process, or Point of View? Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s ''Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation''. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thinking led to a natural alliance with late developments in the [[sociology of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ray E. McKerrow. "Argument Communities: A Quest for Distinctions."&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars drew connections with recent developments in philosophy, namely the [[pragmatism]] of [[John Dewey]] and [[Richard Rorty]]. Rorty has called this shift in emphasis "the [[linguistic turn]]".

In this new hybrid approach argumentation is used with or without [[empirical]] evidence to establish convincing conclusions about issues which are moral, scientific, epistemic, or of a nature in which science alone cannot answer. Out of pragmatism and many intellectual developments in the humanities and social sciences, "non-philosophical" argumentation theories grew which located the formal and material grounds of arguments in particular intellectual fields.  These theories include [[informal logic]], [[social epistemology]], [[ethnomethodology]], [[speech acts]], the sociology of knowledge, the [[sociology of science]], and [[social psychology]]. These new theories are not non-logical or anti-logical. They find logical coherence in most communities of discourse. These theories are thus often labeled "sociological" in that they focus on the social grounds of knowledge.

==Approaches to argumentation in communication and informal logic==
In general, the label "argumentation" is used by communication scholars such as (to name only a few) Wayne E. Brockriede, Douglas Ehninger, [[Joseph W. Wenzel]], Richard Rieke, Gordon Mitchell, Carol Winkler, Eric Gander, [[Dennis S. Gouran]], [[Daniel J. O'Keefe]], Mark Aakhus, Bruce Gronbeck, James Klumpp, [[G. Thomas Goodnight]], [[Robin Rowland]], [[Dale Hample]], [[C. Scott Jacobs]], [[Sally Jackson]], [[David Zarefsky]], and [[Charles Arthur Willard]], while the term "[[informal logic]]" is preferred by philosophers, stemming from [[University of Windsor]] philosophers [[Ralph Johnson (philosopher)|Ralph H. Johnson]] and [[J. Anthony Blair]]. [[Harald Wohlrapp]] developed a criterion for ''validness'' (Geltung, Gültigkeit) as ''freedom of objections''.

[[Trudy Govier]], [[Doug Walton|Douglas Walton]], Michael Gilbert, Harvey Seigal, [[Michael Scriven]], and [[John Woods (logician)|John Woods]] (to name only a few) are other prominent authors in this tradition. Over the past thirty years, however, scholars from several disciplines have co-mingled at international conferences such as that hosted by the [[University of Amsterdam]] (the Netherlands) and the International Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA). Other international conferences are the biannual conference held at Alta, Utah sponsored by the (US) [[National Communication Association]] and [[American Forensics Association]] and conferences sponsored by the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation (OSSA).

Some scholars (such as Ralph H. Johnson) construe the term "argument" narrowly, as exclusively written discourse or even discourse in which all premises are explicit. Others (such as Michael Gilbert) construe the term "argument" broadly, to include spoken and even nonverbal discourse, for instance the degree to which a war memorial or propaganda poster can be said to argue or "make arguments". The philosopher [[Stephen Toulmin]] has said that an argument is a claim on our attention and belief, a view that would seem to authorize treating, say, propaganda posters as arguments. The dispute between broad and narrow theorists is of long standing and is unlikely to be settled. The views of the majority of argumentation theorists and analysts fall somewhere between these two extremes.

== Kinds of argumentation ==

===Conversational argumentation===
{{Main article|Conversation analysis|Discourse analysis}}
The study of naturally occurring conversation arose from the field of sociolinguistics. It is usually called ''conversation analysis.'' Inspired by ethnomethodology, it was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s principally by the sociologist [[Harvey Sacks]] and, among others, his close associates [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]]. Sacks died early in his career, but his work was championed by others in his field, and CA has now become an established force in sociology, anthropology, linguistics, speech-communication and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Psathas, George (1995): Conversation Analysis, Thousand Oaks: Sage Sacks, Harvey. (1995). Lectures on Conversation. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-55786-705-4}}. Sacks, Harvey, Schegloff, Emanuel A., &amp; Jefferson, Gail (1974). A simple systematic for the organization of [[turn-taking]] for conversation. Language, 50, 696-735. Schegloff, Emanuel A. (2007). Sequence Organization in Interaction: A Primer in Conversation Analysis, Volume 1, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Ten Have, Paul (1999): Doing Conversation Analysis. A Practical Guide, Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly influential in [[interactional sociolinguistics]], discourse analysis and discursive psychology, as well as being a coherent discipline in its own right. Recently CA techniques of sequential analysis have been employed by phoneticians to explore the fine phonetic details of speech.

Empirical studies and theoretical formulations by Sally Jackson and Scott Jacobs, and several generations of their students, have described argumentation as a form of managing conversational disagreement within communication contexts and systems that naturally prefer agreement.

===Mathematical argumentation===
{{Main article|Philosophy of mathematics}}

The basis of mathematical truth has been the subject of long debate. [[Frege]] in particular sought to demonstrate (see Gottlob Frege, [[The Foundations of Arithmetic]], 1884, and ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', 1879) that arithmetical truths can be derived from purely logical axioms and therefore are, in the end, [[logical truth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boolos|first1=George|title=Logic, logic, and logic|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674537675|edition=2nd print.|chapter=Chapter 9: Gottlob Frege and the Foundations of Arithmetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was developed by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. If an argument can be cast in the form of sentences in Symbolic Logic, then it can be tested by the application of accepted proof procedures. This has been carried out for Arithmetic using [[Peano axioms]]. Be that as it may, an argument in Mathematics, as in any other discipline, can be considered valid only if it can be shown that it cannot have true premises and a false conclusion.

===Scientific argumentation===
{{Main article|Philosophy of science|Rhetoric of science}}

Perhaps the most radical statement of the social grounds of scientific knowledge appears in Alan G.Gross's ''The Rhetoric of Science'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990). Gross holds that science is rhetorical "without remainder",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetoric of Science|last=Gross|first=Alan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0674768734|location=|pages=33|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that scientific knowledge itself cannot be seen as an idealized ground of knowledge. Scientific knowledge is produced rhetorically, meaning that it has special epistemic authority only insofar as its communal methods of verification are trustworthy. This thinking represents an almost complete rejection of the foundationalism on which argumentation was first based.

===Interpretive argumentation===
{{Main article|Interpretive discussion}}

Interpretive argumentation is a dialogical process in which participants [[divergent thinking|explore]] and/or [[convergent thinking|resolve]] interpretations often of a [[text (literary theory)|text]] of any medium containing significant [[ambiguity]] in meaning.

Interpretive argumentation is pertinent to [[humanities|the humanities]], [[hermeneutics]], [[literary theory]], [[linguistics]], [[semantics]], [[pragmatics]], [[semiotics]], [[analytic philosophy]] and [[Analytic philosophy#Aesthetics|aesthetics]].  Topics in [[Interpretation (philosophy)#Conceptual interpretations|conceptual interpretation]] include [[Aesthetic interpretation|aesthetic]], [[Judicial interpretation|judicial]], [[Logical interpretation|logical]] and [[Religious interpretation|religious]] interpretation.  Topics in [[Interpretation (philosophy)#Scientific interpretation|scientific interpretation]] include [[scientific modeling]].

===Legal argumentation===
{{Main article|Oral argument|Closing argument}}

Legal arguments are spoken presentations to a judge or appellate court by a lawyer, or parties when representing themselves of the legal reasons why they should prevail. Oral argument at the appellate level accompanies written briefs, which also advance the argument of each party in the legal dispute. A closing argument, or summation, is the concluding statement of each party's counsel reiterating the important arguments for the trier of fact, often the jury, in a court case. A closing argument occurs after the presentation of evidence.

===Political argumentation===
{{Main article|Political argument}}

Political arguments are used by academics, media pundits, candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McGee. "The 'Ideograph' as a Unit of Analysis in Political Argument." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, eds. Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality of the public is a major question in this line of research. Political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin]] coined the expression "[[low information voter]]s" to describe most voters who know very little about politics or the world in general.

In practice, a "[[low information voter]]" may not be aware of legislation that their representative has [[Sponsor (legislative)|sponsored]] in Congress.  A low-information voter may base their [[ballot box]] decision on a media sound-bite, or a flier received in the mail.  It is possible for a media sound-bite or campaign flier to present a political position for the [[incumbent]] candidate that completely contradicts the legislative action taken in the Capitol on behalf of the constituents.  It may only take a small percentage of the overall voting group who base their decision on the inaccurate information, a voter block of 10 to 12%, to swing an overall election result.  When this happens, the constituency at large may have been duped or fooled.  Nevertheless, the election result is legal and confirmed.  Savvy [[political consulting|Political consultants]] will take advantage of low-information voters and sway their votes with [[disinformation]] because it can be easier and sufficiently effective.  [[Fact checker]]s have come about in recent years to help counter the effects of such campaign tactics.

==Psychological aspects==
[[Psychology]] has long studied the non-logical aspects of argumentation.  For example, studies have shown that [[Ad nauseam|simple repetition of an idea]] is often a more effective method of argumentation than appeals to reason.  [[Propaganda]] often utilizes repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul, ''Propaganda'', Vintage, 1973, {{ISBN|0-394-71874-7}} {{ISBN|978-0394718743}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi rhetoric has been studied extensively as, inter alia, a repetition campaign.

Empirical studies of communicator credibility and attractiveness, sometimes labeled ''charisma,'' have also been tied closely to empirically-occurring arguments. Such studies bring argumentation within the ambit of persuasion theory and practice.

Some psychologists such as William J. McGuire believe that the [[syllogism]] is the basic unit of human reasoning. They have produced a large body of empirical work around McGuire's famous title "A Syllogistic Analysis of Cognitive Relationships". A central line of this way of thinking is that logic is contaminated by psychological variables such as "wishful thinking", in which subjects confound the likelihood of predictions with the desirability of the predictions. People hear what they want to hear and see what they expect to see. If planners want something to happen they see it as likely to happen. If they hope something will not happen, they see it as unlikely to happen. Thus smokers think that they personally will avoid cancer, promiscuous people practice unsafe sex, and teenagers drive recklessly.

==Theories==

===Argument fields===
[[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[Charles Arthur Willard]] have championed the idea of argument fields, the former drawing upon [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Ludwig Wittgenstein's]] notion of [[language-game|language games]], (Sprachspiel) the latter drawing from communication and argumentation theory, sociology, political science, and social epistemology. For Toulmin, the term "field" designates discourses within which arguments and factual claims are grounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Stephen E.|last = Toulmin|title= The Uses of Argument|date = 1958|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 978-0521092302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Willard, the term "field" is interchangeable with "community", "audience", or "readership".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Arthur Willard. "Some Questions About Toulmin's View of Argument Fields." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, eds. ''Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation''. 1980. "Field Theory: A Cartesian Meditation." George Ziegelmueller and Jack Rhodes, eds. ''Dimensions of Argument: Proceedings of the Second Summer Conference on Argumentation.''&lt;/ref&gt; Along similar lines, G. Thomas Goodnight has studied "spheres" of argument and sparked a large literature created by younger scholars responding to or using his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;G. T. Goodnight, "The Personal, Technical, and Public Spheres of Argument." ''Journal of the American Forensics Association.'' (1982) 18:214-227.&lt;/ref&gt; The general tenor of these field theories is that the premises of arguments take their meaning from social communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Gronbeck. "Sociocultural Notions of Argument Fields: A Primer." George Ziegelmueller and Jack Rhodes, eds. ''Dimensions of Argument: Proceedings of the Second Summer Conference on Argumentation.'' (1981) 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Field studies might focus on social movements, issue-centered publics (for instance, pro-life versus pro-choice in the abortion dispute), small activist groups, corporate public relations campaigns and issue management, scientific communities and disputes, political campaigns, and intellectual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rowland, "Purpose, Argument Fields, and Theoretical Justification." ''Argumentation.'' vol. 22 Number 2 (2008) 235-250.&lt;/ref&gt; In the manner of a sociologist, ethnographer, anthropologist, participant-observer, and journalist, the field theorist gathers and reports on real-world human discourses, gathering case studies that might eventually be combined to produce high-order explanations of argumentation processes. This is not a quest for some master language or master theory covering all specifics of human activity. Field theorists are agnostic about the possibility of a single grand theory and skeptical about the usefulness of such a theory. Theirs is a more modest quest for "mid-range" theories that might permit generalizations about families of discourses.

===Stephen E. Toulmin's contributions===
By far, the most influential theorist has been [[Stephen Toulmin]], the Cambridge educated philosopher and student of Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loui|first=Ronald P. |editor1-first=David| editor1-last=Hitchcock |editor2-first=Bart| editor2-last=Verheij |title=Arguing on the Toulmin Model: New Essays in Argument Analysis and Evaluation |year=2006 |publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=31–38|chapter=A Citation-Based Reflection on Toulmin and Argument |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xE5ichwr5MC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;ots=gGspeEoAs-&amp;dq=A%20Citation-Based%20Reflection%20on%20Toulmin%20and%20Argument&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Citation-Based%20Reflection%20on%20Toulmin%20and%20Argument&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-4020-4937-8 |quote=Toulmin's 1958 work is essential in the field of argumentation |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4938-5_3 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; What follows below is a sketch of his ideas.

====An alternative to absolutism and relativism====
Toulmin has argued that absolutism (represented by theoretical or analytic arguments) has limited practical value. Absolutism is derived from Plato's idealized formal logic, which advocates universal truth; thus absolutists believe that moral issues can be resolved by adhering to a standard set of moral principles, regardless of context. By contrast, Toulmin asserts that many of these so-called standard principles are irrelevant to real situations encountered by human beings in daily life.

To describe his vision of daily life, Toulmin introduced the concept of argument fields; in ''The Uses of Argument'' (1958), Toulmin states that some aspects of arguments vary from field to field, and are hence called "field-dependent", while other aspects of argument are the same throughout all fields, and are hence called "field-invariant". The flaw of absolutism, Toulmin believes, lies in its unawareness of the field-dependent aspect of argument; absolutism assumes that all aspects of argument are field invariant.

Toulmin's theories resolve to avoid the defects of absolutism without resorting to relativism: relativism, Toulmin asserted, provides no basis for distinguishing between a moral or immoral argument. In ''Human Understanding'' (1972), Toulmin suggests that anthropologists have been tempted to side with relativists because they have noticed the influence of cultural variations on rational arguments; in other words, the anthropologist or relativist overemphasizes the importance of the "field-dependent" aspect of arguments, and becomes unaware of the "field-invariant" elements. In an attempt to provide solutions to the problems of absolutism and relativism, Toulmin attempts throughout his work to develop standards that are neither absolutist nor relativist for assessing the worth of ideas.

Toulmin believes that a good argument can succeed in providing good justification to a claim, which will stand up to criticism and earn a favourable verdict.

====Components of argument====
In ''The Uses of Argument'' (1958), Toulmin proposed a layout containing [[Toulmin Model of Argument|six interrelated components for analyzing arguments]]:

#Claim: Conclusions whose merit must be established. For example, if a person tries to convince a listener that he is a British citizen, the claim would be "I am a British citizen." (1)
#Data: The facts we appeal to as a foundation for the claim. For example, the person introduced in 1 can support his claim with the supporting data "I was born in Bermuda." (2)
#Warrant: The statement authorizing our movement from the data to the claim. In order to move from the data established in 2, "I was born in Bermuda," to the claim in 1, "I am a British citizen," the person must supply a warrant to bridge the gap between 1 &amp; 2 with the statement "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen." (3)
#Backing: Credentials designed to certify the statement expressed in the warrant; backing must be introduced when the warrant itself is not convincing enough to the readers or the listeners. For example, if the listener does not deem the warrant in 3 as credible, the speaker will supply the legal provisions as backing statement to show that it is true that "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen."
#Rebuttal: Statements recognizing the restrictions to which the claim may legitimately be applied. The rebuttal is exemplified as follows, "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British citizen, unless he has betrayed Britain and has become a spy of another country."
#Qualifier: Words or phrases expressing the speaker's degree of force or certainty concerning the claim. Such words or phrases include "possible," "probably," "impossible," "certainly," "presumably," "as far as the evidence goes," or "necessarily." The claim "I am definitely a British citizen" has a greater degree of force than the claim "I am a British citizen, presumably."

The first three elements "claim", "data", and "warrant" are considered as the essential components of practical arguments, while the second triad "qualifier", "backing", and "rebuttal" may not be needed in some arguments.

When first proposed, this layout of argumentation is based on legal arguments and intended to be used to analyze the rationality of arguments typically found in the courtroom; in fact, Toulmin did not realize that this layout would be applicable to the field of [[rhetoric]] and communication until his works were introduced to rhetoricians by Wayne Brockriede and Douglas Ehninger. Only after he published ''Introduction to Reasoning'' (1979) were the rhetorical applications of this layout mentioned in his works.

==== The evolution of knowledge ====
Toulmin's ''Human Understanding'' (1972) asserts that conceptual change is evolutionary. This book attacks Thomas Kuhn's explanation of conceptual change in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. Kuhn held that conceptual change is a revolutionary (as opposed to an evolutionary) process in which mutually exclusive paradigms compete to replace one another. Toulmin criticizes the relativist elements in Kuhn's thesis, as he points out that the mutually exclusive paradigms provide no ground for comparison; in other words, Kuhn's thesis has made the relativists' error of overemphasizing the "field variant" while ignoring the "field invariant", or commonality shared by all argumentation or scientific paradigms.

Toulmin proposes an evolutionary model of conceptual change comparable to Darwin's model of biological evolution. On this reasoning, conceptual change involves innovation and selection. Innovation accounts for the appearance of conceptual variations, while selection accounts for the survival and perpetuation of the soundest conceptions. Innovation occurs when the professionals of a particular discipline come to view things differently from their predecessors; selection subjects the innovative concepts to a process of debate and inquiry in what Toulmin considers as a "forum of competitions". The soundest concepts will survive the forum of competition as replacements or revisions of the traditional conceptions.

From the absolutists' point of view, concepts are either valid or invalid regardless of contexts; from a relativists' perspective, one concept is neither better nor worse than a rival concept from a different cultural context. From Toulmin's perspective, the evaluation depends on a process of comparison, which determines whether or not one concept will provide improvement to our explanatory power more so than its rival concepts.

====Rejection of certainty====
In ''Cosmopolis'' (1990), Toulmin traces the quest for certainty back to Descartes and Hobbes, and lauds Dewey, Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Rorty for abandoning that tradition.

===Pragma-dialectics===
{{Main article|Pragma-dialectics}}

Scholars at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands have pioneered a rigorous modern version of [[dialectic]]  under the name ''pragma-dialectics''. The intuitive idea is to formulate clearcut rules that, if followed, will yield rational discussion and sound conclusions. [[Frans H. van Eemeren]], the late [[Rob Grootendorst]], and many of their students have produced a large body of work expounding this idea.

The dialectical conception of reasonableness is given by ten rules for critical discussion, all being instrumental for achieving a resolution of the difference of opinion (from Van Eemeren, Grootendorst, &amp; Snoeck Henkemans, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182-183). The theory postulates this as an ideal model, and not something one expects to find as an empirical fact. The model can however serve as an important heuristic and critical tool for testing how reality approximates this ideal and point to where discourse goes wrong, that is, when the rules are violated. Any such violation will constitute a [[fallacy]]. Albeit not primarily focused on fallacies, pragma-dialectics provides a systematic approach to deal with them in a coherent way.

===Walton's logical argumentation method===

[[Doug Walton]] developed a distinctive philosophical theory of logical argumentation built around a set of practical methods to help a user identify, analyze and evaluate arguments in everyday conversational discourse and in more structured areas such as debate, law and scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|title=Methods of Argumentation|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main components: argumentation schemes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|last2=Reed|first2=Chris|last3=Macagno|first3=Fabrizio|title=Argumentation Schemes|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; dialogue structures, argument mapping tools, and formal argumentation systems. The method uses the notion of commitment in dialogue as the fundamental tool for the analysis and evaluation of argumentation rather than the notion of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|last2=Krabbe|first2=E. C. W.|title=Commitment in Dialogue: Basic Concepts of Interpersonal Reasoning|date=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commitments are statements that the agent has expressed or formulated, and has pledged to carry out, or has publicly asserted. According to the commitment model, agents interact with each other in a dialogue in which each takes its turn to contribute speech acts. The dialogue framework uses critical questioning as a way of testing plausible explanations and finding weak points in an argument that raise doubt concerning the acceptability of the argument.

Walton's logical argumentation model takes a different view of proof and justification from that taken in the dominant epistemology in analytical philosophy, which is based on a [[justified true belief]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|last2=Zhang|first2=Nanning|title=The Epistemology of Scientific Evidence|journal=Artificial Intelligence and Law|date=2 October 2013|volume=21|issue=2|page=1|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2335090|publisher=Social Science Research Network|language=en|quote=In  place of the traditional epistemological view of knowledge as justified true belief we argue that artificial  intelligence and law needs an evidence -based epistemology}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the logical argumentation approach, knowledge is seen as form of belief commitment firmly fixed by an argumentation procedure that tests the evidence on both sides, and use standards of proof to determine whether a proposition qualifies as knowledge. On this evidence-based approach, scientific knowledge must be seen as defeasible.

== Artificial intelligence ==
{{See also|Argument mapping|Argumentation framework}}
Efforts have been made within the field of [[artificial intelligence]] to perform and analyze the act of argumentation with computers.  Argumentation has been used to provide a proof-theoretic semantics for [[non-monotonic logic]], starting with the influential work of Dung (1995). Computational argumentation systems have found particular application in domains where formal logic and classical decision theory are unable to capture the richness of reasoning, domains such as law and medicine. In ''Elements of Argumentation'', Philippe Besnard and Anthony Hunter show how classical logic-based techniques can be used to capture key elements of practical argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;P. Besnard &amp; A. Hunter, "Elements of Argumentation." MIT Press, 2008.

[[Image:TEMET_HV_Blast_Damper.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Blast Damper with integral grill to shield against flying objects]]
A blast damper is used to protect occupants and equipment of a structure against [[overpressure]]s resultant of an explosion. The blast dampers normally protect air inlets and exhaust penetrations in an otherwise hardened structure. Blast dampers are related or identical to [[blast valve]]s, the latter name is generally used to describe blast mitigation devices as they relate to nuclear explosions.

==Operation==
Blast dampers usually employ some type of blade held open with tension from a spring. The damper blades close automatically when pressure overcomes the resistance offered by the spring. Various models differ in the amount of blast protection (e.g. 1bar/14.5psi or lower amounts of protection) and whether they stay closed after the blast or remain functional.

==Design==
Typical blast dampers are sized to match [[HVAC]] ductwork and provide proper airflow with low [[pressure drop]]. Common applications include protecting equipment and personnel of control rooms and accommodation modules in petrochemical and [[industrial process]] facilities onshore and offshore. Acid- and [[corrosion]]-resistant versions are often requested in these instances.

The '''carbon cycle''' is the [[biogeochemical cycle]] by which [[carbon]] is exchanged among the [[biosphere]], [[pedosphere]], [[geosphere]], [[hydrosphere]], and [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of the Earth]]. Carbon is the main component of biological compounds as well as a major component of many minerals such as limestone. Along with the [[nitrogen cycle]] and the [[water cycle]], the carbon cycle comprises a sequence of events that are key to make Earth capable of sustaining life. It describes the movement of carbon as it is recycled and reused throughout the biosphere, as well as long-term processes of [[carbon sequestration]] to and release from [[carbon sink]]s.

The carbon cycle was discovered by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], and popularized by [[Humphry Davy]].&lt;ref name="AOW"&gt;Holmes, Richard (2008). "The Age Of Wonder", Pantheon Books. {{ISBN|978-0-375-42222-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The global carbon cycle is now usually divided into the following major reservoirs of carbon interconnected by pathways of exchange:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=David|title=The global carbon cycle|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400837076}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5–6}}
* The [[atmosphere]]
* The terrestrial [[biosphere]]
* The [[World Ocean|ocean]], including [[total inorganic carbon|dissolved inorganic carbon]] and living and non-living marine biota
* The [[sediment]]s, including [[fossil fuel]]s, freshwater systems, and non-living organic material.
* The Earth's interior ([[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[crust (geology)|crust]]). These carbon stores interact with the other components through geological processes.

The carbon exchanges between reservoirs occur as the result of various chemical, physical, geological, and biological processes. The ocean contains the largest active pool of carbon near the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;
The natural flows of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean, terrestrial ecosystems, and sediments are fairly balanced so that carbon levels would be roughly stable without human influence.&lt;ref name=Prentice_etal_2001&gt;{{Cite web |last=Prentice |first=I.C. |title=The carbon cycle and atmospheric carbon dioxide |url=http://ir.anet.ua.ac.be/irua/handle/10067/381670151162165141?show=full |publisher=Climate change 2001: the scientific basis: contribution of Working Group I to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change / Houghton, J.T.

===Atmosphere===
{{Main|Atmospheric carbon cycle}}
[[File:Carbon dioxide emissions global carbon cycle.jpg|thumb|upright 1.1|The ocean and land have continued to absorb about half of all carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, even as anthropogenic emissions have risen dramatically in recent decades.

Carbon in the Earth's atmosphere exists in two main forms: [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. Both of these gases absorb and retain heat in the atmosphere and are partially responsible for the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Falkowski |first1=P. |last2=Scholes |first2=R.

Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere primarily through [[photosynthesis]] and enters the terrestrial and oceanic biospheres. Carbon dioxide also dissolves directly from the atmosphere into bodies of water (ocean, lakes, etc.), as well as dissolving in precipitation as raindrops fall through the atmosphere. When dissolved in water, carbon dioxide reacts with water molecules and forms [[carbonic acid]], which contributes to ocean acidity. It can then be absorbed by rocks through weathering. It also can acidify other surfaces it touches or be washed into the ocean.&lt;ref name=Planet&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Many Planets, One Earth // Section 4: Carbon Cycling and Earth's Climate |url=http://www.learner.org/courses/envsci/unit/text.php?unit=1&amp;secNum=4 |journal=Many Planets, One Earth |volume=4 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human activities over the past two centuries have significantly increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, mainly in the form of carbon dioxide, both by modifying ecosystems' ability to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and by emitting it directly, e.g., by burning fossil fuels and manufacturing concrete.&lt;ref name="GlobalCarbonCycle"/&gt;

===Terrestrial biosphere===
{{Main|Terrestrial biological carbon cycle}}
[[File:SRS1000 being used to measure soil respiration in the field..jpg|thumb|right|A portable soil respiration system measuring soil {{CO2}} flux]]
The terrestrial biosphere includes the organic carbon in all land-living organisms, both alive and dead, as well as carbon stored in [[soil]]s. About 500 gigatons of carbon are stored above ground in plants and other living organisms,&lt;ref name=Prentice_etal_2001/&gt; while soil holds approximately 1,500 gigatons of carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rice|first1=Charles W.|title=Storing carbon in soil: Why and how?|journal=Geotimes|date=January 2002|volume=47|issue=1|pages=14&amp;ndash;17|url=http://www.geotimes.org/jan02/feature_carbon.html|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most carbon in the terrestrial biosphere is organic carbon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/gcbb.12401|title=Investigating the biochar effects on C-mineralization and sequestration of carbon in soil compared with conventional amendments using the stable isotope (δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) approach|journal=GCB Bioenergy|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1085–1099|year=2016|last1=Yousaf|first1=Balal|last2=Liu|first2=Guijian|last3=Wang|first3=Ruwei|last4=Abbas|first4=Qumber|last5=Imtiaz|first5=Muhammad|last6=Liu|first6=Ruijia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while about a third of soil carbon is stored in inorganic forms, such as [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref name=Lal-2008&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1039/b809492f |title=Sequestration of atmospheric {{CO2}} in global carbon pools |last=Lal |first=Rattan |journal=Energy and Environmental Science |volume=1 |pages=86–100 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organic carbon is a major component of all organisms living on earth. [[Autotrophs]] extract it from the air in the form of carbon dioxide, converting it into organic carbon, while [[heterotrophs]] receive carbon by consuming other organisms.

Because carbon uptake in the terrestrial biosphere is dependent on biotic factors, it follows a diurnal and seasonal cycle. In {{CO2}} measurements, this feature is apparent in the [[Keeling curve]]. It is strongest in the northern [[Hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]] because this hemisphere has more land mass than the southern hemisphere and thus more room for ecosystems to absorb and emit carbon.

Carbon leaves the terrestrial biosphere in several ways and on different time scales. The [[combustion]] or [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] of organic carbon releases it rapidly into the atmosphere. It can also be exported into the ocean through rivers or remain sequestered in soils in the form of inert carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Mingxu|last2=Peng|first2=Changhui|last3=Wang|first3=Meng|last4=Xue|first4=Wei|last5=Zhang|first5=Kerou|last6=Wang|first6=Kefeng|last7=Shi|first7=Guohua|last8=Zhu|first8=Qiuan|date=2017-09|title=The carbon flux of global rivers: A re-evaluation of amount and spatial patterns|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=80|pages=40–51|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.049|issn=1470-160X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon stored in soil can remain there for up to thousands of years before being washed into rivers by [[erosion]] or released into the atmosphere through [[soil respiration]]. Between 1989 and 2008 soil respiration increased by about 0.1% per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bond-Lamberty|first1=Ben|last2=Thomson|first2=Allison|title=Temperature-associated increases in the global soil respiration record|journal=Nature|date=25 March 2010|volume=464|issue=7288|pages=579–582|doi=10.1038/nature08930|pmid=20336143|bibcode=2010Natur.464..579B}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the global total of {{CO2}} released by soil respiration was roughly 98 billion tonnes, about 10 times more carbon than humans are now putting into the atmosphere each year by burning fossil fuel (this does not represent a net transfer of carbon from soil to atmosphere, as the respiration is largely offset by inputs to soil carbon). There are a few plausible explanations for this trend, but the most likely explanation is that increasing temperatures have increased rates of decomposition of [[soil organic matter]], which has increased the flow of {{CO2}}. The length of carbon sequestering in soil is dependent on local climatic conditions and thus changes in the course of [[climate change]]. &lt;!-- From pre-industrial era to 2010, the terrestrial biosphere represented a net source of atmospheric {{CO2}} prior to 1940, switching subsequently to a net sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Huang, Junling and McElroy, Michael B. |url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10981610/The%20contemporary%20and%20historical%20budget%20of%20atmospheric%20CO2_1%202.pdf?sequence=9 |title=The Contemporary and Historical Budget of Atmospheric {{CO2}}|journal=Canadian Journal of Physics |volume = 90 | issue = 8  | pages = 707–716 |year=2012 |doi=10.1139/p2012-033|bibcode = 2012CaJPh..90..707H }}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Ocean===
{{Main|Oceanic carbon cycle}}
The ocean can be conceptually divided into a [[surface layer]] within which water makes frequent (daily to annual) contact with the atmosphere, and a deep layer below the typically [[mixed layer]] depth of a few hundred meters or less, within which the time between consecutive contacts may be centuries. The  dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the surface layer is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere, maintaining equilibrium. Partly because its concentration of DIC is about 15% higher&lt;ref name=Sarmiento_and_Gruber_2006&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sarmiento |first1=J.L. |last2=Gruber |first2=N. |title=Ocean Biogeochemical Dynamics |year=2006 |publisher=Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mainly due to its larger volume, the deep ocean contains far more carbon—it's the largest pool of actively cycled carbon in the world, containing 50 times more than the atmosphere&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;—but the timescale to reach equilibrium with the atmosphere is hundreds of years: the exchange of carbon between the two layers, driven by [[thermohaline circulation]], is slow.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;

Carbon enters the ocean mainly through the dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide, a small fraction of which is converted into [[carbonate]]. It can also enter the ocean through rivers as [[dissolved organic carbon]]. It is converted by organisms into organic carbon through [[photosynthesis]] and can either be exchanged throughout the food chain or precipitated into the ocean's deeper, more carbon-rich layers as dead soft tissue or in shells as [[calcium carbonate]]. It circulates in this layer for long periods of time before either being deposited as sediment or, eventually, returned to the surface waters through thermohaline circulation.&lt;ref name=Prentice_etal_2001/&gt; Oceans are basic (~pH 8.2), hence {{CO2}} acidification shifts the pH of the ocean towards neutral.   

Oceanic absorption of {{CO2}} is one of the most important forms of [[carbon sequestering]] limiting the human-caused rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. However, this process is limited by a number of factors. &lt;!--Because the carbonate buffering of {{CO2}} in the ocean is dependent on the weathering of rocks and this process takes place slower than current rates of human greenhouse gas emissions, absorption of {{CO2}} by the surface ocean will decrease in the future.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;--&gt; {{CO2}} absorption makes water more acidic, which affects ocean biosystems. The projected rate of increasing [[Ocean acidification|oceanic acidity]] could slow the biological precipitation of [[calcium carbonate]]s, thus decreasing the ocean's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide.&lt;ref name=Klyepas1999&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kleypas |first1=J.

&lt;!--According to a study done by Dr. Grace Saba of Rutgers University and Professor Deborah Steinberg of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science marine organisms such as copepods and other small drifting organisms play a key role in the biological pump by feeding on the photosynthetic algae on the surface then releasing the carbon they've ingested as "fecal pellets". These pellets rapidly sink to the bottom of the ocean; releasing carbon into the deep sea.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}--&gt;

===Earth's interior===
The geologic component of the carbon cycle operates slowly in comparison to the other parts of the global carbon cycle. It is one of the most important determinants of the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus of global temperatures.&lt;ref name=NASA&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Slow Carbon Cycle |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/CarbonCycle/page2.php |author=NASA |accessdate=2012-06-24 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the earth's carbon is stored inertly in the earth's [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt; Much of the carbon stored in the earth's mantle was stored there when the earth formed.&lt;ref name=DiVenere2012&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/carbon.htm The Carbon Cycle and Earth's Climate] Information sheet for Columbia University Summer Session 2012 Earth and Environmental Sciences Introduction to Earth Sciences I&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it was deposited in the form of organic carbon from the biosphere.&lt;ref name=Berner1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berner|first1=Robert A.|title=A New Look at the Long-term Carbon Cycle|journal=GSA Today|date=November 1999|volume=9|issue=11|pages=1&amp;ndash;6|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e2c5/d2eb552fa447ded17dfb920e9ebb668c8d68.pdf|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the carbon stored in the geosphere, about 80% is [[limestone]] and its derivatives, which form from the sedimentation of [[calcium carbonate]] stored in the shells of marine organisms. The remaining 20% is stored as [[kerogen]]s formed through the sedimentation and burial of terrestrial organisms under high heat and pressure. Organic carbon stored in the geosphere can remain there for millions of years.&lt;ref name=NASA/&gt;

Carbon can leave the geosphere in several ways. Carbon dioxide is released during the [[Metamorphism (geology)|metamorphosis]] of carbonate rocks when they are [[Subduction|subducted]] into the earth's mantle. This carbon dioxide can be released into the atmosphere and ocean through [[Volcanism|volcanoes]] and [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]].&lt;ref name=DiVenere2012/&gt; It can also be removed by humans through the direct extraction of kerogens in the form of [[fossil fuels]]. After extraction, fossil fuels are burned to release energy, thus emitting the carbon they store into the atmosphere

==Human influence==

[[File:Carbon cycle human perturbation.png|upright=1.7|thumb|alt=Human perturbation of the carbon cycle|Human activity since the industrial era has changed the balance in the natural carbon cycle. Units are in gigatons.&lt;ref name=Prentice_etal_2001/&gt;]]
[[File:M15-162b-EarthAtmosphere-CarbonDioxide-FutureRoleInGlobalWarming-Simulation-20151109.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] in [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] if ''half'' of global-warming emissions are ''not'' absorbed.&lt;ref name="NASA-20151112-ab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20151112b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20151110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20151109" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;([[NASA]] [[computer simulation]]).]]
Since the [[industrial revolution]], human activity has modified the carbon cycle by changing its components' functions and directly adding carbon to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=GlobalCarbonCycle/&gt;

The largest human impact on the carbon cycle is through direct emissions from burning [[fossil fuels]], which transfers carbon from the geosphere into the atmosphere. The rest of this increase is caused mostly by changes in land-use, [[Deforestation and climate change|particularly deforestation]].

Another direct human impact on the carbon cycle is the chemical process of [[calcination]] of [[limestone]] for [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] production, which releases {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC (2007) [https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg3/en/ch7s7-4-5.html 7.4.5 Minerals] in ''Climate Change 2007'': Working Group III: Mitigation of Climate Change,&lt;/ref&gt; Clinker is an industrial [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] of [[cement]].

Humans also influence the carbon cycle indirectly by changing the terrestrial and oceanic biosphere.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0070457108703388|title=Developments in Sedimentology|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Elsevier|editor-last=Morse|editor-first=John W.|series=Geochemistry of Sedimentary Carbonates|volume=48|pages=447–510|editor-last2=Mackenzie|editor-first2=Fred T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past several centuries, direct and indirect human-caused [[land use]] and land cover change (LUCC) has led to the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], which lowers ecosystems' resilience to environmental stresses and decreases their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. More directly, it often leads to the release of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. [[Deforestation]] for agricultural purposes removes forests, which hold large amounts of carbon, and replaces them, generally with agricultural or urban areas. Both of these replacement land cover types store comparatively small amounts of carbon so that the net product of the process is that more carbon stays in the atmosphere.

Other human-caused changes to the environment change ecosystems' productivity and their ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. [[Air pollution]], for example, damages plants and soils, while many agricultural and land use practices lead to higher [[erosion]] rates, washing carbon out of soils and decreasing plant productivity.
&lt;!--
Higher temperatures and {{CO2}} levels in the atmosphere increase decomposition rates in soil, thus returning {{CO2}} stored in plant material more quickly to the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

However, increased levels of {{CO2}} in the atmosphere can also lead to higher gross primary production. It increases photosynthesis rates by allowing plants to more efficiently use water, because they no longer need to leave their [[stomata]] open for such long periods of time in order to absorb the same amount of carbon dioxide. This type of carbon dioxide fertilization affects mainly [[C3 plants]], because [[C4 plants]] can already concentrate {{CO2}} effectively.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}--&gt;

Humans also affect the oceanic carbon cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Current trends in climate change lead to higher ocean temperatures, thus modifying ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laws|first=Edward A.|last2=Falkowski|first2=Paul G.|last3=Smith|first3=Walker O.|last4=Ducklow|first4=Hugh|last5=McCarthy|first5=James J.|date=2000-12-01|title=Temperature effects on export production in the open ocean|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1231–1246|doi=10.1029/1999GB001229|issn=1944-9224|bibcode=2000GBioC..14.1231L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Taro|last2=Sutherland|first2=Stewart C.|last3=Sweeney|first3=Colm|last4=Poisson|first4=Alain|last5=Metzl|first5=Nicolas|last6=Tilbrook|first6=Bronte|last7=Bates|first7=Nicolas|last8=Wanninkhof|first8=Rik|last9=Feely|first9=Richard A.|date=2002-01-01|title=Global sea–air CO2 flux based on climatological surface ocean pCO2, and seasonal biological and temperature effects|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064502000036|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|series=The Southern Ocean I: Climatic Changes in the Cycle of Carbon in the Southern Ocean|volume=49|issue=9|pages=1601–1622|doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(02)00003-6|bibcode=2002DSRII..49.1601T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sanford|first=Eric|date=1999-03-26|title=Regulation of Keystone Predation by Small Changes in Ocean Temperature|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/283/5410/2095|journal=Science|language=en|volume=283|issue=5410|pages=2095–2097|doi=10.1126/science.283.5410.2095|issn=0036-8075|pmid=10092235|bibcode=1999Sci...283.2095S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, acid rain and polluted runoff from agriculture and industry change the ocean's chemical composition.

The '''Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar)''' is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] that studies the species diversity of one of the largest and most inaccessible environments on the planet, the [[abyssal plain]].  CeDAMar uses data to create an estimation of global species diversity and provide a better understanding of the history of deep-sea fauna, including its present diversity and dependence on environmental parameters.  CeDAMar initiatives aim to identify centers of high biodiversity useful for planning both commercial and conservation efforts, and are able to be used in future studies on the effects of climate change on the deep sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coml.org/projects/census-diversity-abyssal-marine-life-cedamar CeDAMar on COML]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2009, participation by upwards of 56 institutions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedamar.org/Participating-Institutes&lt;/ref&gt; in 17 countries has resulted in the publication of nearly 300 papers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedamar.org/Publication-list CeDAMar]&lt;/ref&gt;  Results of CeDAMar-related research were also published in a 2010 textbook on deep-sea biodiversity by Michael Rex and Ron Etter, members of CeDAMar's Scientific Steering Committee.({{ISBN|978-0674036079}})

CeDAMar is led by Dr. Pedro Martinez Arbizu of Germany and Dr. Craig Smith, USA.

'''''Chief Culture Officer''''' (2009) is the eighth book by [[Canada|Canadian]] [[author]] and [[anthropologist]] [[Grant McCracken]].&lt;ref name=PsychologyToday&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology Today Profile|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/grant-mccracken-phd|publisher=[[Psychology Today]]|date=February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book looks at how modern business attempt to connect with culture.  In the author's analysis he considers examples such as [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty|Dove's campaign for real beauty]], and the [[I Love New York]] advertising campaign.

According to McCracken, the book is about highlighting the importance of modern culture for businesses, and in doing so, to create a position within them for a "person who knows culture, both its fads and fashions, and its deep, enduring structures": a Chief Culture Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.2 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

In the book, McCracken recounts how corporations that successfully adapt to the cultural changes tend to prosper.  His definition of [[culture]] begins with a distinction between fast and slow:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Fast culture is like all the boats on the surface of the Pacific.  We can spot them, track them.  Slow culture is everything beneath the surface: less well charted, much less visible"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.44 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

McCracken argues that when fast and slow culture meet, a convergent culture is created. He points to the [[preppy]] subculture as an example of a convergent culture that brands such as [[Ralph Lauren]] and [[Tommy Hilfiger]] have capitalized on. He also analyses the convergence of [[Social status|status]], shifting from a class based value system to celebrity, and the [[cool (aesthetic)|cool]] convergence, an aesthetic that he states developed alongside the [[baby boomer]] generation.

Changing relationships, McCracken argues, between consumers and producers have created new opportunities for brands to connect with culture. He observes that whilst only [[1% rule (Internet culture)|1 in 100]] people create content on the Internet, the creator consumer dynamic used to be "1 in 10,000".  McCracken believes this change allows consumers to become an "active participant in the branding process". He refers to [[converse (shoe company)|Converse's]] 2005 motto as an illustration of this change: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We don't own the brand.  Consumers do"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.90 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For business's attempting to closely monitor culture, McCracken advises against employing "cool hunters" who "know only what suits them."  Instead, he recommends creating a position for a Chief Culture Officer who is aware of both fast and slow culture, a "creature of many worlds, captives of none."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McCracken |first=Grant |year=2009 |title=Chief Culture Officer |location=P.190 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=978-0-465-02204-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive approaches to grammar''' are theories of [[grammar]] that relate grammar to mental processes and structures in [[human]] [[cognition]]. While Chomsky's theories of generative grammar are the most influential in most areas of [[linguistics]], other theories also deal with the cognitive aspects of grammar.

The approach of [[Noam Chomsky]] and his fellow [[generative grammar]]ians is that of an autonomous mental faculty that it is governed by mental processes operating on mental representations of different kinds of symbols that apply only within this faculty.

Another cognitive approach to grammar is that which is proposed by proponents of [[cognitive linguistics]], which holds that grammar is not an autonomous mental faculty with processes of its own, but that it is intertwined with all other cognitive processes and structures. The basic claim here is that ''grammar is conceptualization''. Some of the theories that fall within this paradigm are [[construction grammar]], [[cognitive grammar]], and [[word grammar]].

'''Configurable modularity''' is a term coined by Raoul de Campo of [[IBM Research]] and later expanded on by [[Nate Edwards]] of the same organization, denoting the ability to reuse independent components by changing their interconnections, but not their internals.&lt;ref&gt;N.P. Edwards, ''On the Architectural Requirements of an Engineered System'', IBM Research Report, RC 6688 (#28797), T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, 8/18/1977&lt;/ref&gt;  In Edwards' view this characterizes all successful reuse systems, and indeed all systems which can be described as "engineered".

'''Demographic transition''' ('''DT''') is the transition from high [[Birth rate|birth]] and [[death rate]]s to lower birth and death rates as a country or region develops from a pre-industrial to an [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] [[economic system]]. The theory was proposed in 1929 by the American [[demography|demographer]] Warren Thompson,&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Warren Thompson|encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Population| volume = 2|pages=939–40|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan Reference]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-02-865677-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; who observed changes, or transitions, in birth and death rates in industrialized societies over the previous 200 years.  Most [[developed countries]] have completed the demographic transition and have low birth rates; most [[developing countries]] are in the process of this transition.&lt;ref name=Caldwell&gt;{{cite book|last=Caldwell|first=John C.|author2=Bruce K Caldwell |author3=Pat Caldwell |author4=Peter F McDonald |author5=Thomas Schindlmayr |title=Demographic Transition Theory|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|year= 2006 |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands|isbn=978-1-4020-4373-4 | page = 239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = About | title = Geography | url = http://geography.about.com/od/culturalgeography/a/demotransition.htm | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The major (relative) exceptions are some poor countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and some [[Middle Eastern]] countries, which are poor or affected by government policy or civil strife, notably, Pakistan, [[Palestinian territories]], [[Yemen]], and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name=Caldwell /&gt;

The demographic transition model, in isolation, can be taken to predict that birth rates will continue to go down as societies grow increasingly wealthy; however, recent data contradicts this, suggesting that beyond a certain level of development birth rates increase again.&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature08230|pmid=19661915|title=Advances in development reverse fertility declines|journal=Nature|volume=460|issue=7256|pages=741–3|year=2009|last1=Myrskylä|first1=Mikko|last2=Kohler|first2=Hans-Peter|last3=Billari|first3=Francesco C.|bibcode=2009Natur.460..741M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the very long term, the demographic transition should be reversed via [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher [[Birth rate|fertility]] and higher [[death rate|mortality]].&lt;ref name=bbc_sure&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19923200 Can we be sure the world's population will stop rising?], BBC News, 13 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of some kind of demographic transition is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical [[correlation]] linking dropping fertility to social and economic development.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt; Scholars debate whether industrialization and higher incomes [[Causation (sociology)|lead to]] lower population, or whether lower populations lead to industrialization and higher incomes. Scholars also debate to what extent various proposed and sometimes inter-related factors such as higher [[per capita]] income, higher female income, lower mortality, old-age security, and rise of demand for human capital are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galor|first1=Oded|title=The demographic transition: causes and consequences|journal=Cliometrica|date=17 February 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1007/s11698-011-0062-7|pmid=25089157|pmc=4116081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Demographic-TransitionOWID.png|thumb|upright=2.75|Demographic transition overview, with below-replacement-fertility broken out into a "stage 5"]]

==History of the theory==
The theory is based on an interpretation of [[demography|demographic]] history developed in 1929 by the American demographer Warren Thompson (1887–1973).&lt;ref name=DemenyAndMcNicoll /&gt; [[Adolphe Landry]] of France made similar observations on demographic patterns and population growth potential around 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landry|first1=Adolphe|title=Adolphe Landry on the Demographic Revolution|journal=Population and Development Review|date=December 1987|volume=13|issue=4|pages=731|doi=10.2307/1973031|jstor=1973031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s [[Frank W. Notestein]] developed a more formal theory of demographic transition.&lt;ref name="Woods2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Robert|title=The Demography of Victorian England and Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75DZmQtybMwC&amp;pg=PA18|date=2000-10-05|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78254-8|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, the existence of a negative correlation between fertility and industrial development had become one of the most widely accepted findings in social science.&lt;ref name="Nature" /&gt;

==Summary of the theory==
[[File:Demographic-Transition-5-countries.png|thumb|upright=2.75|Demographic change in Germany, Sweden, Chile, Mauritius, China from 1820 to 2010.&lt;br /&gt;Pink line: crude [[death rate]] (CDR), green line: (crude) [[birth rate]] (CBR), yellow line: population.]]

The transition involves four stages, or possibly five.

* In stage one, [[pre-industrial society ]], death rates and birth rates are high and roughly in balance. All human populations are believed to have had this balance until the late 18th century, when this balance ended in Western Europe.&lt;ref name= "marathon.uwc.edu"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | publisher = UWC | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, growth rates were less than 0.05% at least since the Agricultural Revolution over 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Population growth is typically very slow in this stage, because the society is constrained by the available food supply; therefore, unless the society develops new technologies to increase food production (e.g. discovers new sources of food or achieves higher crop yields), any fluctuations in birth rates are soon matched by death rates.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* In stage two, that of a developing country, the death rates drop quickly due to improvements in food supply and sanitation, which increase life expectancies and reduce disease. The improvements specific to food supply typically include selective breeding and crop rotation and farming techniques.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Other improvements generally include access to ovens, baking, and television. For example, numerous improvements in public health reduce mortality, especially childhood mortality.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Prior to the mid-20th century, these improvements in public health were primarily in the areas of food handling, water supply, sewage, and personal hygiene.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; One of the variables often cited is the increase in female literacy combined with public health education programs which emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; In Europe, the death rate decline started in the late 18th century in northwestern Europe and spread to the south and east over approximately the next 100 years.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; Without a corresponding fall in birth rates this produces an [[Demographic trap|imbalance]], and the countries in this stage experience a large increase in [[population]].
* In stage three, birth rates fall due to various [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factors]] such as access to [[contraception]], increases in wages, [[urbanization]], a reduction in [[subsistence agriculture]], an increase in the status and education of women, a reduction in the value of children's work, an increase in parental investment in the education of children and other social changes.  Population growth begins to level off. The birth rate decline in developed countries started in the late 19th century in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; While improvements in contraception do play a role in birth rate decline, it should be noted that contraceptives were not generally available nor widely used in the 19th century and as a result likely did not play a significant role in the decline then.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt; It is important to note that birth rate decline is caused also by a transition in values; not just because of the availability of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="marathon.uwc.edu"/&gt;
* During stage four there are both low birth rates and low death rates. Birth rates may drop to well below replacement level as has happened in countries like [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Japan]], leading to a [[population decline|shrinking population]], a threat to many industries that rely on population growth. As the large group born during stage two ages, it creates an economic burden on the shrinking working population. Death rates may remain consistently low or increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle diseases due to low exercise levels and high [[obesity]] and an aging population in [[developed countries]]. By the late 20th century, birth rates and death rates in developed countries leveled off at lower rates.&lt;ref name="geography.about.com"/&gt;
* Some scholars break out, from stage four, a "stage five" of below-replacement fertility levels. Others hypothesize a different "stage five" involving an increase in fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure/&gt;

As with all models, this is an idealized picture of population change in these countries. The model is a generalization that applies to these countries as a group and may not accurately describe all individual cases. The extent to which it applies to less-developed societies today remains to be seen. Many countries such as [[China]], [[Brazil]] and [[Thailand]] have passed through the Demographic Transition Model (DTM) very quickly due to fast social and economic change. Some countries, particularly African countries, appear to be stalled in the second stage due to stagnant development and the effect of [[AIDS]].

==Stage One==
In pre-industrial society, death rates and birth rates were both high, and fluctuated rapidly according to natural events, such as drought and disease, to produce a relatively constant and young population. Family planning and contraception were virtually nonexistent; therefore, birth rates were essentially only limited by the ability of women to bear children. Emigration depressed death rates in some special cases (for example, Europe and particularly the Eastern United States during the 19th century), but, overall, death rates tended to match birth rates, often exceeding 40 per 1000 per year. Children contributed to the economy of the household from an early age by carrying water, firewood, and messages, caring for younger siblings, sweeping, washing dishes,  preparing food, and working in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geographyfieldwork.com/DemographicTransition.htm|title=Demographic Transition Model|website=geographyfieldwork.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising a child cost little more than feeding him or her; there were no education or entertainment expenses.  Thus, the total [[Cost of raising a child|cost of raising children]] barely exceeded their contribution to the household.  In addition, as they became adults they become a major input to the family business, mainly farming, and were the primary form of insurance for adults in old age.  In India, an adult son was all that prevented a widow from falling into destitution.  While death rates remained high there was no question as to the need for children, even if the means to prevent them had existed.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

During this stage, the society evolves in accordance with [[Malthusian growth model|Malthusian]] paradigm, with population essentially determined by the food supply. Any fluctuations in food supply (either positive, for example, due to technology improvements, or negative, due to droughts and pest invasions) tend to translate directly into population fluctuations. [[Famine]]s resulting in significant mortality are frequent. Overall, [[population dynamics]] during stage one are comparable to those of animals living in the wild. According to Edward, Revocatus. (2016) This is the earlier stage of demographic transition in the world and also characterized by primary activities such as small fishing activities, farming practices, pastoralism and petty businesses.

==Stage Two==
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|World population 10,000 BC-2017 AD]]
This stage leads to a fall in death rates and an increase in population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml BBC bitesize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023172810/http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/geography/population/popchangestructurerev5.shtml |date=October 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The changes leading to this stage in Europe were initiated in the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] of the 18th century and were initially quite slow.  In the 20th century, the falls in death rates in developing countries tended to be substantially faster.  Countries in this stage include [[Yemen]], [[Afghanistan]], the [[Palestinian territories]] and [[Iraq]] and much of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (but do not include [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Botswana]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Namibia]], [[Kenya]], [[Gabon]] and [[Ghana]], which have begun to move into stage 3).&lt;ref name=Caldwell10&gt;Caldwell (2006), Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in the death rate is due initially to two factors:
*First, improvements in the food supply brought about by higher yields in agricultural practices and better transportation reduce death due to starvation and lack of water.  Agricultural improvements included [[crop rotation]], [[selective breeding]], and [[seed drill]] technology.
*Second, significant improvements in public health reduce mortality, particularly in childhood. These are not so many medical breakthroughs (Europe passed through stage two before the advances of the mid-20th century, although there was significant medical progress in the 19th century, such as the development of [[vaccination]]) as they are improvements in water supply, [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]], food handling, and general personal [[hygiene]] following from growing scientific knowledge of the causes of disease and the improved education and social status of mothers.

A consequence of the decline in mortality in Stage Two is an increasingly rapid growth in population growth (a.k.a. "[[population explosion]]") as the gap between deaths and births grows wider and wider. Note that this growth is not due to an increase in fertility (or birth rates) but to a decline in deaths. This change in population occurred in north-western Europe during the 19th century due to the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During the second half of the 20th century less-developed countries entered Stage Two, creating the worldwide rapid growth of number of living persons that has demographers concerned today. In this stage of DT, countries are vulnerable to become [[Failed States Index|failed states]] in the absence of progressive governments.

[[File:Angola population pyramid 2005.svg|right|upright=1.7|thumb| [[Population pyramid]] of [[Angola]] 2005]]
Another characteristic of Stage Two of the demographic transition is a change in the [[population pyramid|age structure]] of the population. In Stage One, the majority of deaths are concentrated in the first 5&amp;ndash;10 years of life. Therefore, more than anything else, the decline in death rates in Stage Two entails the increasing survival of children and a growing population. Hence, the age structure of the population becomes increasingly youthful and start to have big families and more of these children enter the reproductive cycle of their lives while maintaining the high fertility rates of their parents. The bottom of the "[[population pyramid|age pyramid]]" widens first where children, teenagers and infants are here, accelerating population growth rate. The age structure of such a population is illustrated by using an example from the [[Third World]] today.

==Stage Three==
In Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model (DTM), death rates are low and birth rates diminish, as a rule accordingly of enhanced economic conditions, an expansion in women’s status and education, and access to contraception. The decrease in birth rate fluctuates from nation to nation, as does the time span in which it is experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-3-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 3 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=16 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage Three moves the population towards stability through a decline in the birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = UWC | url = http://pages.uwc.edu/keith.montgomery/Demotrans/demtran.htm | series = Marathon | title = Geography | contribution = Demographic transition}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]]s contribute to this eventual decline, and are generally similar to [[Sub-replacement fertility#Causes|those associated with sub-replacement fertility]], although some are speculative:
*In rural areas continued decline in childhood death means that at some point parents realize they need not require so many children to be born to ensure a comfortable old age. As childhood death continues to fall and incomes increase parents can become increasingly confident that fewer children will suffice to help in family business and care for them in old age.
*Increasing [[urbanization]] changes the traditional values placed upon fertility and the value of children in rural society. Urban living also raises the cost of dependent children to a family. A recent theory suggests that urbanization also contributes to reducing the birth rate because it disrupts optimal mating patterns. A 2008 study in Iceland found that the most fecund marriages are between distant cousins. Genetic incompatibilities inherent in more distant outbreeding makes reproduction harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Kissing cousins, missing children | url = http://www.economist.com/node/10640683?story_id=10640683 | journal= The Economist | date = 7 February 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In both rural and urban areas, the cost of children to parents is exacerbated by the introduction of compulsory education acts and the increased need to educate children so they can take up a respected position in society.  Children are increasingly prohibited under law from working outside the household and make an increasingly limited contribution to the household, as school children are increasingly exempted from the expectation of making a significant contribution to domestic work.  Even in equatorial Africa, children (age under 5) now required to have clothes and shoes, through the body, and may even require school uniforms. Parents begin to consider it a duty to buy children(s) books and toys,  partly due to education and access to family planning, people begin to reassess their need for children and their ability to grow them.&lt;ref name=Caldwell5/&gt;
[[File:Familyplanningmalaysia.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A major factor in reducing birth rates in stage&amp;nbsp;3 countries such as Malaysia is the availability of family planning facilities, like this one in Kuala Terengganu, Terengganu, Malaysia.]]
*Increasing literacy and employment lowers the uncritical acceptance of childbearing and motherhood as measures of the status of women. Working women have less time to raise children; this is particularly an issue where fathers traditionally make little or no contribution to child-raising, such as [[southern Europe]] or [[Japan]].  Valuation of women beyond childbearing and motherhood becomes important.
*Improvements in contraceptive technology are now a major factor. Fertility decline is caused as much by changes in values about children and gender as by the availability of contraceptives and knowledge of how to use them.

The resulting changes in the age structure of the population include a decline in the youth [[dependency ratio]] and eventually [[population aging]]. The population structure becomes less triangular and more like an elongated balloon. During the period between the decline in youth dependency and rise in old age dependency there is a [[demographic window]] of opportunity that can potentially produce economic growth through an increase in the ratio of working age to dependent population; the [[demographic dividend]].

However, unless factors such as those listed above are allowed to work, a society's birth rates may not drop to a low level in due time, which means that the society cannot proceed to stage Three and is locked in what is called a [[demographic trap]].

Countries that have witnessed a fertility decline of over 50% from their pre-transition levels include: [[Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Panama]], [[Jamaica]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]], [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[Lebanon]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and many [[Pacific islands]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of 25–50% include: [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Demographics of Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], [[Demographics of Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Demographics of Zimbabwe| Zimbabwe]].

Countries that have experienced a fertility decline of less than 25% include: [[Demographics of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Demographics of Niger|Niger]], [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].

==Stage Four==
This occurs where birth and death rates are both low, leading to a total population stable. Death rates are low for a number of reasons, primarily lower rates of diseases and higher production of food. The birth rate is low because people have more opportunities to choose if they want children; this is made possible by improvements in contraception or women gaining more independence and work opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.main-vision.com/richard/demographic.htm | title = Main vision | first =  | contribution = Demographic}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The DTM is only a suggestion about the future population levels of a country, not a prediction.

Countries that are at this stage (2 &lt; [[Total Fertility Rate]] &lt; 2.5 in 2015) include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cabo Verde, El Salvador, Faroe Islands, Grenada, Guam, India, Indonesia, Kosovo, Libya, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Myanmar, Nepal, New Caledonia, Nicaragua, Palau, Peru, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tunisia, Turkey and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage Five==
{{See also|Population aging|Aging of Europe|Aging of Japan|Evolutionary psychology}}[[File:World population (UN).svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|United Nation's population projections by location.&lt;br&gt;
Note the vertical axis is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and represents millions of people.]]
The original Demographic Transition model has just four stages, but additional stages have been proposed. Both more-fertile and less-fertile futures have been claimed as a Stage Five.

Some countries have [[sub-replacement fertility]] (that is, below 2.1–2.2 children per woman). Replacement fertility is generally slightly higher than 2 (the level which replaces the two parents) both because boys are born more often than girls (about 1.05–1.1 to 1) and to compensate for deaths prior to full reproduction. Many European and East Asian countries now have higher death rates than birth rates. [[Population aging]] and [[population decline]] may eventually occur, assuming that the fertility rate does not change and sustained mass immigration does not occur.

In an article in the August 2009 issue of ''Nature'', Myrskylä, Kohler and [[Francesco Billari]] argue that the previously negative relationship between "development", as measured by the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI), and birth rates has become J-shaped. The HDI is a composite of life expectancy, income, and level of education. Development promotes fertility decline at HDI levels below 0.9 but further advances in HDI cause a small rebound in birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7256/full/nature08230.html | last1 = Myrskyla | first1 = M | last2 = Kohler | first2 = H-P | last3 = Billari | first3 = F | title= Advances in development reverse fertility declines | journal= Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7256 | pages = 741–43 | date = 6 August 2009| bibcode = 2009Natur.460..741M | doi = 10.1038/nature08230 | pmid=19661915}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries with very high levels of development, fertility rates are now approaching two children per woman — although there are exceptions, notably Germany, Italy and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= The best of all possible worlds? | work = The Economist | date = 6 August 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current century, most developed countries have increased fertility. From the point of view of [[evolutionary biology]], wealthier people having fewer children is unexpected, as [[natural selection]] would be expected to favor individuals who are willing and able to convert plentiful resources into plentiful fertile descendants. This may be the result of a departure from the [[Evolutionary psychology#Environment of evolutionary adaptedness|environment of evolutionary adaptedness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = Alice L. | last2 = Low | first2 = Bobbi S. | year = 2001 | title = Testing evolutionary hypotheses with demographic data | url = | journal = Population and Development Review | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 633–660 | doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2001.00633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Daly |first1=Martin |last2=Wilson |first2=Margo I |title=Human evolutionary psychology and animal behaviour |url=http://courses.washington.edu/evpsych/Daly%26Wilson-HEP-AB1999.pdf |publisher=Department of Psychology, McMaster University |accessdate=14 November 2018 |date=26 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from the perspective of [[evolutionary psychology]], the modern environment is exerting [[evolutionary pressure]] for higher fertility.&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;

[[Jane Falkingham]] of [[Southampton University]] has noted that "We've actually got population projections wrong consistently over the last 50 years... we've underestimated the improvements in mortality... but also we've not been very good at spotting the trends in fertility."&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt; In 2004 a United Nations office published its guesses for global population in the year 2300; estimates ranged from a "low estimate" of 2.3 billion (tending to −0.32% per year) to a "high estimate" of 36.4 billion (tending to +0.54% per year), which were contrasted with a deliberately "unrealistic" illustrative "constant fertility" scenario of 134 trillion (obtained if 1995–2000 fertility rates stay constant into the far future).&lt;ref name=bbc_sure /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Population to 2300|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|accessdate=24 May 2016|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In stage 5 of the demographic transition, a country encounters misfortune as a whole this is because the death rate becomes higher than the birth rate. There will be a negative population growth rate which will affect the country. This will take a generation or two before the population grows back up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.populationeducation.org/content/stage-5-demographic-transition-model|title=Stage 5 of the Demographic Transition Model - Population Education|date=18 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on age structure==
[[File:Dtm pyramids.png|thumb|upright=1.4|One such visualization of this effect may be approximated by these hypothetical population pyramids.  ]]
The decline in death rate and birth rate that occurs during the demographic transition may transform the age structure. When the death rate declines during the second stage of the transition, the result is primarily an increase in the child population. The reason being that when the death rate is high (stage one), the infant mortality rate is very high, often above 200 deaths per 1000 children born. When the death rate falls or improves, this may include lower infant mortality rate and increased child survival. Over time, as individuals with increased survival rates age, there may also be an increase in the number of older children, teenagers, and young adults. This implies that there is an increase in the fertile population proportion which, with constant fertility rates, may lead to an increase in the number of children born. This will further increase the growth of the child population. The second stage of the demographic transition, therefore, implies a rise in child dependency and creates a youth bulge in the population structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population: An Introduction to Concepts and Issues|last=Weeks|first=John R.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=978-1-305-09450-5|location=|pages=94–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a population continues to move through the demographic transition into the third stage, fertility declines and the youth bulge prior to the decline ages out of child dependency into the working ages. This stage of the transition is often referred to as the golden age, and is typically when populations see the greatest advancements in living standards and economic development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, further declines in both mortality and fertility will eventually result in an aging population, and a rise in the aged dependency ratio. An increase of the aged dependency ratio often indicates that a population has reached below replacement levels of fertility, and as result does not have enough people in the working ages to support the economy, and the growing dependent population. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Historical studies==

===Britain===
Between 1750 and 1975 England experienced the transition from high levels of both mortality and fertility, to low levels. A major factor was the sharp decline in the death rate due to infectious diseases, which has fallen from about 11 per 1,000 to less than 1 per 1,000.  By contrast, the death rate from other causes was 12 per 1,000 in 1850 and has not declined markedly. The agricultural revolution and the development of transport, initiated by the construction of canals, led to greater availability of food and coal, and enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]] to improve the standard of living. Scientific discoveries and medical breakthroughs did not, in general, contribute importantly to the early major decline in infectious disease mortality.

===Ireland===
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Irish demographic status converged to the European norm.  Mortality rose above the European Community average, and in 1991 Irish fertility fell to replacement level. The peculiarities of Ireland's past demography and its recent rapid changes challenge established theory. The recent changes have mirrored inward changes in Irish society, with respect to family planning, women in the work force, the sharply declining power of the Catholic Church, and the emigration factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = DA | last = Coleman | title= The Demographic Transition in Ireland in International Context | journal= Proceedings of the British Academy | year = 1992 | issue = 79 | pages = 53–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
France displays real divergences from the standard model of Western demographic evolution.  The uniqueness of the French case arises from its specific demographic history, its historic cultural values, and its internal regional dynamics. France's demographic transition was unusual in that the mortality and the natality decreased at the same time, thus there was no demographic boom in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Quand l'Angleterre rattrapait la France |journal=Population &amp; Societes |date=May 1999 |issue=346 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Demographic_transition&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12 |accessdate=14 November 2018 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France's demographic profile is similar to its European neighbors and to developed countries in general, yet it seems to be staving off the population decline of Western countries. With 62.9 million inhabitants in 2006, it was the second most populous country in the European Union, and it displayed a certain demographic dynamism, with a growth rate of 2.4% between 2000 and 2005, above the European average. More than two-thirds of that growth can be ascribed to a natural increase resulting from high fertility and birthrates. In contrast, France is one of the developed nations whose migratory balance is rather weak, which is an original feature at the European level. Several interrelated reasons account for such singularities, in particular the impact of pro-family policies accompanied by greater unmarried households and out-of-wedlock births. These general demographic trends parallel equally important changes in regional demographics. Since 1982 the same significant tendencies have occurred throughout mainland France: demographic stagnation in the least-populated rural regions and industrial regions in the northeast, with strong growth in the southwest and along the Atlantic coast, plus dynamism in metropolitan areas. Shifts in population between regions account for most of the differences in growth. The varying demographic evolution regions can be analyzed though the filter of several parameters, including residential facilities, economic growth, and urban dynamism, which yield several distinct regional profiles. The distribution of the French population therefore seems increasingly defined not only by interregional mobility but also by the residential preferences of individual households. These challenges, linked to configurations of population and the dynamics of distribution, inevitably raise the issue of town and country planning. The most recent census figures show that an outpouring of the urban population means that fewer rural areas are continuing to register a negative migratory flow – two-thirds of rural communities have shown some since 2000. The spatial demographic expansion of large cities amplifies the process of peri-urbanization yet is also accompanied by movement of selective residential flow, social selection, and sociospatial segregation based on income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Guy | last1 = Baudelle | first2 = David | last2 = Olivier | title= Changement Global, Mondialisation et Modèle De Transition Démographique: réflexion sur une exception française parmi les pays développés | journal= Historiens et Géographes | year = 2006 | volume = 98 | issue = 395 | pages = 177–204 | issn = 0046-757X | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
McNicoll (2006) examines the common features behind the striking changes in health and fertility in East and Southeast Asia in the 1960s–1990’s, focusing on seven countries: Taiwan and South Korea ("tiger" economies), Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia ("second wave" countries), and China and Vietnam ("market-Leninist" economies). Demographic change can be seen as a byproduct of social and economic development together with, in some cases, strong governmental pressures. The transition sequence entailed the establishment of an effective, typically authoritarian, system of local administration, providing a framework for promotion and service delivery in health, education, and family planning.  Subsequent economic liberalization offered new opportunities for upward mobility — and risks of backsliding —, accompanied by the erosion of social capital and the breakdown or privatization of service programs.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Korea====
Cha (2007) analyzes a panel data set to explore how industrial revolution, demographic transition, and human capital accumulation interacted in Korea from 1916–38. Income growth and public investment in health caused mortality to fall, which suppressed fertility and promoted education. Industrialization, skill premium, and closing gender wage gap further induced parents to opt for child quality. Expanding demand for education was accommodated by an active public school building program. The interwar agricultural depression aggravated traditional income inequality, raising fertility and impeding the spread of mass schooling. Landlordism collapsed in the wake of de-colonization, and the consequent reduction in inequality accelerated human and physical capital accumulation, hence leading to growth in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Myung | first = Soo Cha | title = Industrial Revolution, Demographic Transition, and Human Capital Accumulation in Korea, 1916–38 | publisher = Naksungdae Institute of Economic Research | type = working Paper | date = July 2007 | url = http://www.naksung.re.kr/papers/wp2007-7.pdf | format = PDF | place = KR}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madagascar===
Campbell has studied the demography of 19th-century Madagascar in the light of demographic transition theory. Both supporters and critics of the theory hold to an intrinsic opposition between human and "natural" factors, such as climate, famine, and disease, influencing demography. They also suppose a sharp chronological divide between the precolonial and colonial eras, arguing that whereas "natural" demographic influences were of greater importance in the former period, human factors predominated thereafter. Campbell argues that in 19th-century Madagascar the human factor, in the form of the [[Merina Kingdom|Merina state]], was the predominant demographic influence. However, the impact of the state was felt through natural forces, and it varied over time. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Merina state policies stimulated agricultural production, which helped to create a larger and healthier population and laid the foundation for Merina military and economic expansion within Madagascar. From 1820, the cost of such expansionism led the state to increase its exploitation of forced labor at the expense of agricultural production and thus transformed it into a negative demographic force.  Infertility and infant mortality, which were probably more significant influences on overall population levels than the adult mortality rate, increased from 1820 due to disease, malnutrition, and stress, all of which stemmed from state forced labor policies. Available estimates indicate little if any population growth for Madagascar between 1820 and 1895. The demographic "crisis" in Africa, ascribed by critics of the demographic transition theory to the colonial era, stemmed in Madagascar from the policies of the imperial Merina regime, which in this sense formed a link to the French regime of the colonial era. Campbell thus questions the underlying assumptions governing the debate about historical demography in Africa and suggests that the demographic impact of political forces be reevaluated in terms of their changing interaction with "natural" demographic influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Gwyn | last1 = Campbell | title= State and Pre-colonial Demographic History: the Case of Nineteenth-century Madagascar | journal= Journal of African History | year = 1991 | volume = 32 | issue = 3 | pages = 415–45 |  issn = 0021-8537 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700031534}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
{{main article|Demographics of Russia}}

Russia entered stage two of the transition in the 18th century, simultaneously with the rest of Europe, though the effect of transition remained limited to a modest decline in death rates and steady population growth. The population of Russia nearly quadrupled during the 19th century, from 30 million to 133 million, and continued to grow until the First World War and the turmoil that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacitus.nu/historical-atlas/population/russia.htm|title=Population of Eastern Europe|date=|website=tacitus.nu|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia then quickly transitioned through stage three. Though fertility rates rebounded initially and almost reached 7 children/woman in the mid-1920s, they were depressed by the 1931–33 famine, crashed due to the Second World War in 1941, and only rebounded to a sustained level of 3 children/woman after the war. By 1970 Russia was firmly in stage four, with crude birth rates and crude death rates on the order of 15/1000 and 9/1000 respectively.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Russia underwent a unique demographic transition; observers call it a "demographic catastrophe": the number of deaths exceeded the number of births, life expectancy fell sharply (especially for males) and the number of suicides increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor-first = George J | editor-last = Demko | others = et al | title = Population under Duress: The Geodemography of Post-Soviet Russia | year = 1999 | url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=91465272 | publisher = Questia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1992 through 2011, the number of deaths exceeded the number of births.

=== United States ===
Greenwood and Seshadri (2002) show that from 1800 to 1940 there was a [[demographic shift]] from a mostly rural US population with high fertility, with an average of seven children born per white woman, to a minority (43%) rural population with low fertility, with an average of two births per white woman. This shift resulted from technological progress. A sixfold increase in real wages made children more expensive in terms of forgone opportunities to work and increases in agricultural productivity reduced rural demand for labor, a substantial portion of which traditionally had been performed by children in farm families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The U.S. Demographic Transition|last=Greenwood |first=Jeremy |last2=Seshadri |first2=Ananth|date=January 2002|ssrn = 297952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A simplification of the DTM theory proposes an initial decline in mortality followed by a later drop in fertility. The changing demographics of the U.S. in the last two centuries did not parallel this model. Beginning around 1800, there was a sharp fertility decline; at this time, an average woman usually produced seven births per lifetime, but by 1900 this number had dropped to nearly four. A mortality decline was not observed in the U.S. until almost 1900—a hundred years following the drop in fertility.

However, this late decline occurred from a very low initial level. During the 17th and 18th centuries, crude death rates in much of colonial North America ranged from 15 to 25 deaths per 1000 residents per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of the United States|author= Herbert S. Klein|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Population History of North America|author1= Michael R. Haines |author2=Richard H. Steckel|pages=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; (levels of up to 40 per 1000 being typical during stages one and two). Life expectancy at birth was on the order of 40 and, in some places, reached 50, and a resident of 18th century Philadelphia who reached age 20 could have expected, on average, additional 40 years of life.

This phenomenon is explained by the pattern of colonization of the United States. Sparsely populated interior of the country allowed ample room to accommodate all the "excess" people, counteracting mechanisms (spread of communicable diseases due to overcrowding, low real wages and insufficient calories per capita due to the limited amount of available agricultural land) which led to high mortality in the Old World. With low mortality but stage 1 birth rates, the United States necessarily experienced exponential population growth (from less than 4 million people in 1790, to 23 million in 1850, to 76 million in 1900.)

The only area where this pattern did not hold was the American South. High prevalence of deadly endemic diseases such as malaria kept mortality as high as 45–50 per 1000 residents per year in 18th century North Carolina. In [[New Orleans]], mortality remained so high (mainly due to [[yellow fever]]) that the city was characterized as the "death capital of the United States" – at the level of 50 per 1000 population or higher – well into the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael R. |last=Haines |title=The Urban Mortality Transition in the United States, 1800–1940 |journal=NBER Historical Working Paper No. 134 |date=July 2001 |doi=10.3386/h0134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the U.S. is recognized as having both low fertility and mortality rates. Specifically, birth rates stand at 14 per 1000 per year and death rates at 8 per 1000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html#People | title = World factbook | contribution = US | publisher = CIA | place = USA}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical evaluation==
[[File:Years-it-took-Fertility-to-fall-from-6-to-below-3.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Countries with lower economic development have much faster demographic transition than high-income countries.]]
It must be remembered that the DTM is only a model and cannot necessarily predict the future. It does however give an indication of what the future birth and death rates may be for an underdeveloped country, together with the total population size. Most particularly, of course, the DTM makes no comment on change in population due to migration. It is not applicable for high levels of development, as it has been shown that after a [[Human Development Index|HDI]] of 0.9 the fertility increases again.&lt;ref name="Nature"/&gt;

DTM does not account for recent phenomena such as [[AIDS]]; in these areas HIV has become the leading source of mortality.  Some trends in waterborne bacterial infant mortality are also disturbing in countries like [[Malawi]], [[Sudan]] and [[Nigeria]]; for example, progress in the DTM clearly arrested and reversed between 1975 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.populationaction.org/resources/researchCommentaries/Nov06_AgeStructure.htm | contribution = Nigeria: Reversal of Demographic Transition | title = Population action | date = November 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

DTM assumes that population changes are induced by industrial changes and increased wealth, without taking into account the role of social change in determining birth rates, e.g., the education of women. In recent decades more work has been done on developing the social mechanisms behind it.&lt;ref name=Caldwell/&gt;

DTM assumes that the birth rate is independent of the death rate. Nevertheless, demographers maintain that there is no historical evidence for society-wide fertility rates rising significantly after high mortality events. Notably, some historic populations have taken many years to replace lives after events such as the [[Black Death]].

Some have claimed that DTM does not explain the early fertility declines in much of Asia in the second half of the 20th century or the delays in fertility decline in parts of the Middle East.  Nevertheless, the demographer [[John Caldwell (demographer)|John C Caldwell]] has suggested that the reason for the rapid decline in fertility in some [[developing country|developing countries]] compared to Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand is mainly due to government programs and a massive investment in education both by governments and parents.&lt;ref name=Caldwell10/&gt;

==Second demographic transition==
The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) is a conceptual framework first formulated in 1986 by Ron Lesthaeghe and Dirk van de Kaa in a short article that was published in the Dutch sociology journal ''Mens en Maatschappij''.&lt;ref name="Lesthaeghe_2011"&gt;{{citation |author=Ron J. Lesthaeghe |date=2011 |title=The "second demographic transition": a conceptual map for the understanding of late modern demographic developments in fertility and family formation |journal=''Historical Social Research'' |volume=36 |number=2 |pages=179–218 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0168-ssoar-342259}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|181}}&lt;ref name="Bevolking"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ron Lesthaeghe  |author2=Dirk van de Kaa|title=Bevolking: groei en krimp [Population: growth and shrinkage]|date=1986|publisher=Deventer : Van Loghum Slaterus|isbn=9789036800181|pages=9–24|language=|chapter=Twee demografische transities?

Combined with the [[sexual revolution]] and the increased role of women in society and the workforce the resulting changes have profoundly affected the demographics of industrialized countries resulting in a [[sub-replacement fertility]] level.&lt;ref name="Kaa012902"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dirk J. van de Kaa|title=The Idea of a Second Demographic Transition in Industrialized Countries|date=29 January 2002|url=http://websv.ipss.go.jp/webj-ad/WebJournal.files/population/2003_4/Kaa.pdf|accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes, increased numbers of women choosing to not marry or have children, increased cohabitation outside marriage, increased childbearing by single mothers, increased participation by women in higher education and professional careers, and other changes are associated with increased individualism and autonomy, particularly of women. Motivations have changed from traditional and economic ones to those of self-realization.&lt;ref name="PNAC122314"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ron Lesthaeghe|title=The second demographic transition: A concise overview of its development|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=December 23, 2014 |volume=111|issue=51|pages=18112–18115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1420441111|pmid=25453112|pmc=4280616|bibcode=2014PNAS..11118112L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Nicholas Eberstadt, political economist at the [[American Enterprise Institute]] in Washington, described the Second Demographic Transition as one in which "long, stable marriages are out, and divorce or separation are in, along with serial cohabitation and increasingly contingent liaisons."&lt;ref name="WSJ_Eberstadt_2015"&gt;{{citation |quote=‘They’re getting divorced, and they’ll do anything NOT to get custody of the kids.” So reads the promotional poster, in French, for a new movie, “Papa ou Maman"|title=The Global Flight From the Family: It's not only in the West or prosperous nations—the decline in marriage and drop in birth rates is rampant, with potentially dire fallout |author=Nicholas Eberstadt |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nicholas-eberstadt-the-global-flight-from-the-family-1424476179|date=February 21, 2015 |accessdate=February 26, 2017 |publisher=''Wall Street Journal'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18210">A '''doubled haploid''' (DH) is a genotype formed when [[haploid]] cells undergo chromosome doubling. Artificial production of doubled haploids is important in [[plant breeding]].

Haploid cells are produced from [[pollen]] or [[Egg (biology)|egg]] cells or from other cells of the [[gametophyte]], then by induced or spontaneous chromosome doubling, a doubled haploid cell is produced, which can be grown into a doubled haploid plant. If the original plant was [[diploid]], the haploid cells are [[ploidy|monoploid]], and the term '''doubled monoploid''' may be used for the doubled haploids. Haploid organisms derived from [[polyploid|tetraploids]] or [[polyploid|hexaploids]] are sometimes called [[Ploidy#Dihaploidy and polyhaploidy|dihaploids]] (and the doubled dihaploids are, respectively, tetraploid or hexaploid).

Conventional [[inbreeding]] procedures take six generations to achieve approximately complete [[zygosity#Homozygous|homozygosity]], whereas doubled haploidy achieves it in one generation.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, S. Mohan, S. K. Sopory, and R. E. Veilleux. 1996. ''In vitro haploid production in higher plants''. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers. p.317.&lt;/ref&gt; Dihaploid plants derived from tetraploid crop plants may be important for breeding programs that involve diploid wild relatives of the crops.

==History==

The first report of the haploid plant was published by Blakeslee ''et al.'' (1922) in ''Datura stramonium''. Subsequently, haploids were reported in many other species. Guha and Maheshwari (1964) developed an [[anther]] culture technique for the production of haploids in the laboratory. Haploid production by wide crossing was reported in [[barley]] (Kasha and Kao, 1970) and [[tobacco]] (Burk ''et al.'', 1979). Tobacco, [[rapeseed]], and barley are the most responsive species for doubled haploid production. Doubled haploid methodologies have now been applied to over 250 species.&lt;ref name="Maluszynski et al., 2003"&gt;Maluszynski ''et al.'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production of Doubled Haploids==

Doubled haploids can be produced ''[[in vivo]]'' or ''[[in vitro]]''. Haploid embryos are produced ''in vivo'' by [[parthenogenesis]], [[pseudogamy]], or chromosome elimination after wide crossing. The haploid embryo is rescued, cultured, and chromosome-doubling produces doubled haploids. The ''in vitro'' methods include [[gynogenesis]] ([[ovary]] and flower culture) and [[androgenesis]] (anther and microspore culture).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Barnabás |author2=B. Obert |author3=G. Kovács |title=Colchicine, an efficient genome-doubling agent for maize (Zea mays L.) microspores cultured in anthero |journal=Plant Cell Reports |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=858–862 |year=1999 |doi=10.1007/s002990050674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Androgenesis is the preferred method. Another method of producing the haploids is wide crossing. In barley, haploids can be produced by wide crossing with the related species ''[[Hordeum]] bulbosum''; fertilization is affected, but during the early stages of seed development the ''H. bulbosum'' chromosomes are eliminated leaving a haploid embryo. In tobacco (''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]''), wide crossing with ''[[Nicotiana africana]]'' is widely used. When ''N. africana'' is used to pollinate ''N. tabacum'', 0.25 to 1.42 percent of the [[Offspring|progeny]] survive and can readily be identified as either [[F1 hybrid]]s or maternal haploids. Although these percentages appear small, the vast yield of tiny seeds and the early death of most seedlings provide significant numbers of viable hybrids and haploids in relatively small soil containers. This method of interspecific pollination serves as a practical way of producing seed-derived haploids of ''N. tabacum'', either as an alternative method or complementary method to anther culture.

==Genetics of DH population==

In DH method only two types of genotypes occur for a pair of alleles, A and a, with the frequency of ½ AA and ½  aa, while in diploid method three genotypes occur with the frequency of ¼ AA, ½ Aa, ¼ aa. Thus, if AA is desirable genotype, the probability of obtaining this genotype is higher in haploid method than in diploid method. If n loci are segregating, the probability of getting the desirable genotype is (1/2)n by the haploid method and (1/4)n by the diploid method. Hence the efficiency of the haploid method is high when the number of genes concerned is large.
	
Studies were conducted comparing DH method and other conventional breeding methods and it was concluded that adoption of doubled haploidy does not lead to any bias of genotypes in populations, and random DHs were even found to be compatible to selected line produced by conventional pedigree method.&lt;ref&gt;Winzeler ''et al.'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of DHs plant breeding==

===Mapping Quantitative Trait Loci===

Most of the economic traits are controlled by genes with small but cumulative effects. Although the potential of DH populations in quantitative genetics has been understood for some time, it was the advent of molecular marker maps that provided the impetus for their use in identifying loci controlling quantitative traits. As the [[quantitative trait loci]] (QTL) effects are small and highly influenced by environmental factors, accurate [[phenotyping]] with replicated trials is needed. This is possible with doubled haploidy organisms because of their true breeding nature and because they can conveniently be produced in large numbers. Using DH populations, 130 quantitative traits have been mapped in nine crop species.&lt;ref&gt;Forster and Thomas, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 56 DH populations were used for QTL detection.&lt;ref name="Maluszynski et al., 2003"/&gt;

===Backcross breeding===

In [[backcross conversion]], genes are introgressed from a donor [[cultivar]] or related species into a recipient elite line through repeated [[backcross]]ing. A problem in this procedure is being able to identify the lines carrying the trait of interest at each generation. The problem is particularly acute if the trait of interest is recessive, as it will be present only in a heterozygous condition after each backcross. The development of molecular markers provides an easier method of selection based on the genotype (marker) rather than the phenotype. Combined with doubled haploidy it becomes more effective. In marker assisted backcross conversion, a recipient parent is crossed with a donor line and the hybrid (F1) backcrossed to the recipient. The resulting generation (BC1) is backcrossed and the process repeated until the desired genotypes are produced. The combination of doubled haploidy and molecular marker provides the short cut. In the back cross generation one itself a genotype with the character of interest can be selected and converted into homozygous doubled haploid genotype.&lt;ref name="Thomas et al., 2003"&gt;Thomas ''et al.'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Chen ''et al.'' (1994) used marker assisted backcross conversion with doubled haploidy of BC1 individuals to select stripe rust resistant lines in barley.

===Bulked segregant analysis (BSA)===

In [[bulked segregant analysis]], a population is screened for a trait of interest and the genotypes at the two extreme ends form two bulks. Then the two bulks are tested for the presence or absence of molecular markers. Since the bulks are supposed to contrast in the alleles that contribute positive and negative effects, any marker polymorphism between the two bulks indicates the linkage between the marker and trait of interest. BSA is dependent on accurate phenotyping and the DH population has particular advantage in that they are true breeding and can be tested repeatedly. DH populations are commonly used in bulked segregant analysis, which is a popular method in marker assisted breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Ardiel ''et al.'', 2002; William ''et al.'', 2002; Yi ''et al.'', 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; This method has been applied mostly to rapeseed and barley.

===Genetic maps===

Genetic maps are very important to understand the structure and organization of genomes from which evolution patterns and [[syntenic]] relationships between species can be deduced. Genetic maps also provide a framework for the mapping of genes of interest and estimating the magnitude of their effects and aid our understanding of genotype/phenotype associations. DH populations have become standard resources in genetic mapping for species in which DHs are readily available. Doubled haploid populations are ideal for genetic mapping. It is possible to produce a genetic map within two years of the initial cross regardless of the species. Map construction is relatively easy using a DH population derived from a hybrid of two homozygous parents as the expected segregation ratio is simple, ''i.e.'' 1:1. DH populations have now been used to produce genetic maps of barley, rapeseed, rice, wheat, and pepper. DH populations played a major role in facilitating the generation of the molecular marker maps in eight crop species.&lt;ref name="Maluszynski et al., 2003"/&gt;

===Genetic studies===

Genetic ratios and mutation rates can be read directly from haploid populations. A small doubled haploid (DH) population was used to demonstrate that a dwarfing gene in barley is located chromosome 5H.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''et al.'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; In another study the segregation of a range of markers has been analyzed in barley.&lt;ref&gt;Schon ''et al.'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genomics===

Although QTL analysis has generated a vast amount of information on gene locations and the magnitude of effects on many traits, the identification of the genes involved has remained elusive. This is due to poor resolution of QTL analysis. The solution for this problem would be production of recombinant chromosome substitution line,&lt;ref&gt;RCSLs, Paterson ''et al.'', 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; or stepped aligned recombinant inbred lines.&lt;ref&gt;STAIRS, Kearsey 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, backcrossing is carried out until a desired level of recombination has occurred and genetic markers are used to detect desired recombinant chromosome substitution lines in the target region, which can be fixed by doubled haploidy.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas ''et al.'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In rice, molecular markers have been found to be linked with major genes and QTLs for resistance to rice blast, bacterial blight, and sheath blight in a map produced from DH population.&lt;ref&gt;Wang ''et al.'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elite crossing===

Traditional breeding methods are slow and take 10–15 years for cultivar development. Another disadvantage is inefficiency of selection in early generations because of [[heterozygosity]].
These two disadvantages can be over come by DHs, and more elite crosses can be evaluated and selected within less time.

===Cultivar development===

Uniformity is a general requirement of cultivated line in most species, which can be easily obtained through DH production.&lt;ref&gt;International Symposium on Genetic Manipulation in Crops. 1988. Genetic manipulation in crops proceedings of the International Symposium on Genetic Manipulation in Crops, the 3rd International Symposium on Haploidy, the 1st International Symposium on Somatic Cell Genetics in Crops, Beijing, October 1984.'' Natural resources and the environment series'', v. 22. (London: Published for the International Rice Research Institute and Academia Sinica by Cassell Tycooly), p.318.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various ways in which DHs can be used in cultivar production. The DH lines themselves can be released as cultivars, they may be used as parents in hybrid cultivar production or more indirectly in the creation of breeders lines and in germplasm conservation. Barley has over 100 direct DH cultivars.&lt;ref name="Thomas et al., 2003"/&gt; According to published information there are currently around 300 DH derived cultivars in 12 species worldwide.

The relevance of DHs to plant breeding has increased markedly in recent years owing to the development of protocols for 25 species.&lt;ref name="Maluszynski et al., 2003"/&gt; Doubled haploidy already plays an important role in hybrid cultivar production of vegetables, and the potential for ornamental production is being vigorously examined. DHs are also being developed in the medicinal herb ''[[Valeriana officinalis]]'' to select lines with high pharmacological activity. Another interesting development is that fertile homozygous DH lines can be produced in species that have self-incompatibility systems.&lt;ref&gt;Immonen and Anttila, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of DHs==

The ability to produce homozygous lines after a single round recombination saves a lot of time for the plant breeders. Studies conclude that random DH’s are comparable to the selected lines in pedigree inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;Friedt ''et al.'', 1986; Winzeler ''et al.'', 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; The other advantages include development of large number of homozygous lines, efficient genetic analysis and development of markers for useful traits in much less time. More specific benefits include the possibility of seed propagation as an alternative to vegetative multiplication in ornamentals, and in species such as trees in which long life cycles and inbreeding depression preclude traditional breeding methods, doubled haploidy provides new alternatives.

==Disadvantages of DHs==

The main disadvantage with the DH population is that selection cannot be imposed on the population. But in conventional breeding selection can be practised for several generations: thereby desirable characters can be improved in the population.

In haploids produced from anther culture, it is observed that some plants are aneuploids and some are mixed haploid-diploid types. Another disadvantage associated with the double haploidy is the cost involved in establishing tissue culture and growth facilities. The over-usage of doubled haploidy may reduce genetic variation in breeding germplasm. Hence one has to take several factors into consideration before deploying doubled haploidy in breeding programmes.

==Conclusions==

Technological advances have now provided DH protocols for most plant genera. The number of species amenable to doubled haploidy has reached a staggering 250 in just a few decades. Response efficiency has also improved with gradual removal of species from recalcitrant category. Hence it will provide greater efficiency of plant breeding.

'''''Earth Abides''''' is a 1949 [[post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[George R. Stewart]]. It tells the story of the fall of civilization from deadly disease and its rebirth. The story was set in the United States in the 1940s in [[Berkeley, California]] and told by a character, Isherwood Williams, who emerges from isolation in the mountains to find almost everyone dead.

''Earth Abides'' won the inaugural [[International Fantasy Award]] in 1951. It was included in [[Locus (magazine)|''Locus'' Magazine's]] list of best All Time Science Fiction in 1987 and 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusATNomList.html |title=The Locus Index to SF Awards: Locus All-Time Poll Nominees List |author=Locus Magazine |accessdate=2008-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815034424/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/LocusATNomList.html |archivedate=2010-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a nominee to be entered into the [[Prometheus Award|Prometheus Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfs.org/hof_nominees.htm|title=Prometheus Hall of Fame Nominees|author=Libertarian Futurist Society| accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1950, it was adapted for the [[CBS]] radio program ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'' as a two-part drama starring [[John Dehner]].

==Plot==

==="Part I: World Without End"===
While working on his graduate thesis in geography in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains, Ish is bitten by a [[rattlesnake]]. As he heals from the bite, taking refuge in a cabin, he gets sick with a disease that looks like [[measles]], and he moves in and out of consciousness (at one point being approached by two men who flee in fright). He recovers and makes his way back to civilization, only to discover that it has utterly collapsed -most people had died from the same disease. He goes to his home in Berkeley. In the city near his home Ish meets few human survivors – a man drinking himself to death, a couple who seem to have lost their sanity, and a teenage girl who flees from him as someone dangerous. He comes across a dog (a beagle bitch), friendly and eager to join him.  The dog, which he names Princess, swiftly adopts Ish as her new master and sticks by him for much of the book. He sets out on a cross-country tour, traveling all the way to [[New York City]] and back, scavenging for food and fuel as he goes. As he travels, he finds small pockets of survivors, but has doubts about humanity's ability to survive the loss of civilization.

He returns to his home in California after reading [[Ecclesiastes]] (and realizing he had been throwing his life away), to find a woman, Emma (Em), living nearby.  They agree to consider themselves married and have children. They are gradually joined by other survivors. Over time the electricity fails and the comforts of civilization recede. As the children grow, Ish tries to instill basic academics by teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography, but he is largely unsuccessful due to a lack of interest by the others.

Many children are born in these years and among them is Joey, Ish's youngest and favorite son. Joey is very similar in nature to Ish, as he demonstrates innate intelligence and a curiosity about the world before the epidemic. This leads Ish to believe that Joey is the key to the future.

==="Part II: The Year 22"===

Twenty-two years later, the community flourishes. The younger generation adapts easily to the more traditional world. They come to have a better grasp of the natural world than the adults, and when running water fails, the younger generation comes to the rescue, knowing where flowing streams may be found. Ish turns his attention from ecology to his newly forming society. One thing that he notices is that the children are becoming very [[superstitious]]. One day Ish asks for his [[hammer]], an antique miner's tool he found in the mountains, which he habitually carries around, and finds the children are afraid to touch it. It is a symbol for them of the old times. The long-dead "Americans" are now like gods—and Ish is too.

In the Year 22, the older boys return from a cross country trip with a stranger named Charlie, who exposes the tribe to typhoid fever. The disease kills many, including Ish's beloved son Joey.  Through his despair, Ish is forced to face the future with a different set of expectations and hopes.  His ambition to restore civilization to its original state is replaced by a more modest, practical one to simply convey a few basic survival skills.

As years go by, the community begins to grow [[corn]] and make and play with bows and arrows. Ish presides at meetings, his hammer being a [[Status symbol|symbol of his status]]. He is given respect, but his ideas are ignored by the younger men.

==="Part III: The Last American"===

Ish spends most of his elderly life in a fog, unaware of the world. Superstition has set in; the tribe has reverted to a traditional lifestyle, hunting with dogs and bow and arrow. Occasionally the fog in his mind lifts. During one such time, he finds himself aware of his great-grandson Jack, who stands before him. Jack shows him that the bow and arrow have become more reliable than the [[gun]], whose [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] do not always work. Ish realizes that the former civilization is now completely gone. But he also wonders if the new world is that much worse off than the old world, and finds himself hoping that the new world will not rebuild civilization and its mistakes.

==Characters==
''Isherwood Williams'' (Ish) is a [[graduate student]] at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], studying the [[geography]] of an area in the mountains, somewhere in California.  He is sometimes referred to in the book as "The Last American."  Ish becomes the leader of the community, aka "the tribe", he believes due to his intellect.  His nickname, Ish, is an obvious reference to [[Ishi]], the "last Wild Indian."  Ish is also the word for "man" in Biblical Hebrew.

''Emma'' (Em) is a woman who Isherwood meets in his hometown. The author may have been taking a chance with this character, who is, at least partially, African-American,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/74664|title=The Box Of Paperbacks Book Club: Earth Abides by George R. Stewart (1949)|author=Keith Phipps|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Isherwood is white; when the book was written, [[interracial marriages]] were heavily discouraged in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lostbooks.org/reviews/1998-06-11-1.html |title=Lost Book Archives, Earth Abides by George R.

Em becomes the community's mother, letting it grow as it will, but stepping in to help when no one else is filling the leadership role. She was the adult while others panicked, and Ish thought of her as the "Mother of Nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=295–299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ezra'' meets Emma and Ish while traveling through Berkley, he was a former liquor salesman and immigrant from Yorkshire, England. They liked him, but feared the complications of a [[love triangle]], so they encouraged him to leave. He returned with Molly and Jean, his [[Polygamy|wives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=142–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ish values Ezra as a good judge of people, saying "Ezra knew people, Ezra liked people."

''George'' is a carpenter by trade. George is not intellectually intelligent but becomes a Jack-of-all-trades able to build, repair or maintain the limited infrastructure of the small community.

''Evie'' is a "half grown girl" who Ezra found living "in squalor and solitude."  She appears to have little mind left, if she ever had one, and everyone cares for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evie grows into an attractive young woman but the tribe has a rule, that as the children grow no one will marry her—she wouldn't understand, and her mental condition could possibly be hereditary.

''Joey'' is the youngest son of Ish and Em. Of all the children in the Tribe, he is the only one that truly understands the academic skills that Ish tries to teach — geometry, reading, geography. He dies during the typhoid fever outbreak.

''Charlie'' is a stranger who arrives from Los Angeles after two of the "boys" (the second generation) make a scouting expedition in a refurbished Jeep to see what is left of America. Immediately upon his arrival Ish and Ezra become suspicious about Charlie and the type of person he might be. Their suspicions are confirmed a day later when Charlie sets his eye on Evie. He also reveals to Ezra after drinking heavily that he has had many of [[Sexually transmitted infection|"Cupid's" diseases]]. Ish confronts Charlie about Evie, Charlie is disrespectful and challenges Ish's authority as leader. It is revealed that Charlie carries a concealed pistol and his behavior reveals himself as someone who was probably a violent criminal before the epidemic. As a result, Ish, Em, Ezra and George debate what to do about Charlie for the safety of the community, exile or execution. Charlie is the carrier of the typhoid epidemic that infects the community.

''Jack'' is Ish's great-grandson. Jack is confident, intelligent and a potential leader. Ish sees something of Joey in him. As Ish dies, he gives Jack his hammer.  (The hammer became an important symbol for "the tribe" over Ish's lifetime.)

==Major themes==

===Biological controls on population===
On the title page Stewart immediately starts with the theme, quoting [[Ecclesiastes]] 1:4 — "Men go and come, but earth abides." For the first half of ''Earth Abides'', George R. Stewart concentrates on a major theme for the book, that humans have no privileged place in nature and are not immune to nature's built-in [[population control]]s. The main character, an ecologist, states it plainly, "When anything gets too numerous it's likely to get hit by some plague".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first page Stewart tells readers how contagion could bring the end very quickly for mankind:
::"If a killing type of virus strain should suddenly arise by [[mutation]]...it could, because of the rapid transportation in which we indulge nowadays, be carried to the far corners of the earth and cause the deaths of millions of people." W.M. Stanley, in Chemical and Engineering News, December 22, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few pages he makes it clear that basic biology applies to humans too: 
::"Some zoologists have even suggested a biological law: that the number of individuals in a species never remains constant, but always rises and falls—the higher the animal and the slower its breeding-rate, the longer its period of fluctuation[...]As for man, there is littler reason to think that he can in the long run escape the fate of other creatures, and if there is a biological law of flux and reflux, his situation is now a highly perilous one....Biologically, man has for too long a time been rolling an uninterrupted run of sevens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of smaller population ===
Reviewer [[Noel Perrin]] has pointed out that George R. Stewart had written two books before this, in which the main character was not a person, but "a natural force."  In ''[[Storm (novel)|Storm]]'' the main character is weather, and in ''Fire'', a [[forest fire]] takes center stage.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Perrin | first = Noel | date = Spring 2003  | title = unlisted title | journal = American Scholar | volume =  | issue = 72.2| pages = 109| publisher = Gale | location =Gale Document Number: A101175935 | url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/start.do?p=LitRC&amp;u=wylrc_sheridanc  | accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way, Stewart centers the first half of ''Earth Abides'' on the forces of [[natural selection|natural]] and [[artificial selection]]. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an [[ecologist]], and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care of them or controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.

Another theme of the book is what happens to human skills as the population decreases. Reviewer [[Lionel Shriver]] points out this theme in an article about literature which features human extinction:
::But as Stewart tracks three post-plague generations, he vividly demonstrates that advanced civilisation depends on numbers. Reduce the race to the size of a small town and how many residents will remember how to make [[plastic]]? The last Americans plunder [[canned goods]] (with little respect for [[sell-by date]]s), and [[literacy]] atrophies; electrical and water systems break down. At length, the community reverts to its hunter-gatherer forebears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Shriver  | first = Lionel  | date = June 10, 2002  | title = Population doomsday | journal = New Statesman | volume = 131 | issue = 4591| pages = 38| publisher = EBSCO Host Academic Search Premier  | location = | url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=6808391&amp;site=ehost-live  | accessdate = 2008-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart uses the second half of his book to show that, if humans are reduced to low numbers, it will be difficult for them to continue civilization as we know it. Reading becomes a casualty.

::The society is so small that the death of one member—a little boy named Joey—seems likely to determine for many generations to come whether the emerging society will or won't be literate...As Ish thinks of it, each new baby is a candle lit against the dark.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup" /&gt;

If skills and customs don't work in the new situation, these die out, or those holding them do. Children adapt naturally to the new situation, and immediately useful customs and skills are more interesting to them than reading and writing. The information in libraries is useless within a generation.

One custom that Stewart predicts could die out is racism. When there are fewer partners to choose from, mankind will not be able to afford to be too choosy in picking one's partner.

Another issue he brings up is how law and order will function, when the lawmakers, courts and enforcers are all gone. Even laws won't be immune to the pressure to survive. One of the characters in the book point out, "What laws?" when they have to determine the fate of an outsider. Stewart shows how people may come to worry about potential harm rather than justice when dealing with outsiders.

===Biblical theme: replenishing the Earth===
Having explored the [[Depopulation|depopulated]] Earth, Stewart shifts his thematic focus in part 2 and 3, from the biological theme of population crash to a biblical theme of populating the world.

A 1949 book review says that ''Earth Abides'' parallels two biblical stories that shows mankind spreading out and populating the world:
::...the dual themes are as old as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]...Not a [[Deluge (mythology)|flood]] but a swift and deadly new disease wipes out all but a few of the human race. Ish (for "Isherwood") is the Noah of this "Great Disaster."  As material civilization begins to crumble, Ish gradually devolves into a kind of Adam who, inevitably, finds his Eve, Em (For "Emma"), a level-headed lady with Negro blood, and nature takes its time-worn course. Em is  hailed by Ish as "The Mother of Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bell  | first = Eric T.  |date=December 1949  | title = Books: Earth Abides by George R. Stewart. Random House, Inc. New York | journal = Engineering and Science Monthly | volume = XIII | issue = 3| pages = 3–4| publisher = California Institute of Technology | location = Pasadena, California | url = http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/309/01/books.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-03-15|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart, who specialized in meanings of names, chose names in [[Hebrew]] that have appropriate meanings for the biblical theme; this couple who restart the human tribe are symbolically ''man'' and ''mother.'' In Stewart’s day, most Hebrew dictionaries stated that Ish means "man" (although a more accurate English equivalent is "participant"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_78.pdf|title=The Noun איש ('îš) in Biblical Hebrew: A Term of Affiliation |journal=Journal of Hebrew Scriptures | volume= 8|year=2008|author=David E. S. Stein|accessdate=2009-02-15|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Em means "mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proz.com/kudoz/501201|title=Mother, mom, -em, ima (translation glossary|author=Thijs van Dorssen|accessdate=2008-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both terms figure prominently in the biblical story of Adam and Eve: Ish in Genesis 2:23, and Em in Genesis 3:20.

In addition to the [[Hebraic]] names in ''Earth Abides'', the story also has a symbol in common with biblical tradition—the snake. Ish encounters a rattlesnake; before this event he is part of a larger civilization. After it bites him, his world changes, just as the snake changes Adam's world in the ''Genesis'' story. Adam loses paradise, and Ish finds civilization dead.

Aside from the biblical origin of ''Ish'', there is another tale of the fall of civilization that George R. Stewart could have taken account of, the story of [[Ishi]], the last of his tribe, who lived at Berkeley, where Stewart later taught.
''Ish'' is very similar to ''[[Ishi]]'', and it also means "man", in the language of a man whose whole tribe was dead. Ishi's story parallels the ''Genesis'' and ''Earth Abides'' stories, telling of one who has to adapt to a changed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/11a/ea92.htm |title=George R. Stewart |accessdate=2007-06-12 |last=Dodds |first=Georges T |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
''Earth Abides'' fits into the "[[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]]" [[genre|subgenre]] of [[science fiction]]. It was published in 1949, four years after the end of World War II and in the earliest stages of the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. While [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic fiction]] is now quite common, ''Earth Abides'' distinctly predates many similar well-known novels including ''[[Alas, Babylon]]'' (1959), ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]'' (1960), and ''[[The Last Ship (novel)|The Last Ship]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencynow.com/aptable1.htm|title= False utopias of simulation and technology|author=Ken Sanes|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1988). It is predated, however by ''[[The Last Man]]'' (1826), ''[[The Machine Stops]]'' (1909), ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taint.org/2004/07/27/071602a.html |title=Justin Mason's Weblog, July 27, 2004: Post-Apocalyptic Fiction|author=Justin Mason| accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1912), and [[René Barjavel]]'s ''[[Ravage (novel)|Ashes, Ashes]]'' (''Ravage'', 1943), among others.

A common theme of post-apocalyptic works is, "What if the world we know no longer exists," and each of these books paints a different picture of the future.  ''Earth Abides'' explores such issues as family structure, education, the meaning and purpose of civilization, and the basic nature of humankind — especially in regard to religion, superstition, and custom. As it was written in the beginning years of the cold war, it lacks some common post-apocalyptic conventions found in later novels: there are no warlords or biker gangs (as in ''[[Mad Max]]''); there is no fear of atomic weapons or radiation, no mutants and no warring tribes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffworld.com/brevoff/279.html|title=Official sffworld.com Book Review: Earth Abides by George Rippey Stewart (2006-06-06)|author=Rob L. Bedford|accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as in ''[[A Canticle for Leibowitz]]''). When the main character in ''Earth Abides'' travels through the country, he notices little sign of there having been violence or civil unrest during the plague period. Many areas seem to have been evacuated, and only in or near hospitals are there large numbers of corpses.

==Reception==
&lt;!--- I need to get access to some late 40s and early 50s newspapers or to a university library to do this section. If anyone has the ability, feel free to work on this ---&gt;
According to WorldCat.org, there have been [http://worldcat.org/oclc/2205195?tab=editions#tabs 28 editions] of ''Earth Abides'' published in English. The book has been in print in every decade from 1949 to 2008.

[[James Sallis]], writing in 2003 in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'':
{{quote|This is a book, mind you, that I'd place not only among the greatest science fiction but among our very best novels. Each time I read it, I'm profoundly affected, affected in a way only the greatest art — [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]], [[Matisse]] or [[Beethoven]] symphonies, say — affects me. Epic in sweep, centering on the person of Isherwood Williams, ''Earth Abides'' proves a kind of antihistory, relating the story of humankind backwards, from ever-more-abstract civilization to stone-age primitivism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grasslimb.com/sallis/GlobeColumns/globe.06.earth.html Sallis, James."''Earth Abides'': Stewart's dark eulogy for humankind," ''Boston Globe'', February 16. 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Astounding Science Fiction|''Astounding'']] reviewer [[P. Schuyler Miller]] identified the novel as one of the first regarding "a young and little understood science, the science of ecology." Miller praised Stewart for "the intricacy of detail with which he has worked out his problem in ecology" and for writing "quietly, with very few peaks of melodrama as seem necessary in much popular fiction."&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews", [[Astounding Science Fiction|''Astounding'']], October 1950, pp.129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

It was mentioned in a serious overview of modern science fiction, ''Contemporary Science Fiction'' by [[August Derleth]], in the January 1952 edition of ''College English''. Derleth called it an "excellent example" of the "utopian theme" of "rebuilding after a holocaust leaving but few survivors."

It was described as a persuasive answer to the question, "What is man," in the October, 1973 edition of ''Current Anthropology''. The article "Anthropology and Science Fiction" &lt;ref&gt;Stover, Leon. "Anthropology and Science Fiction." ''Current Anthropology'' 14:4(471-474).&lt;/ref&gt; examines the nature of Science Fiction and its relationship to understanding people. The magazine concluded of ''Earth Abides'' that it shows ..."man is man, be he civilized or tribal. Stewart shows us that a tribal hunting culture is just as valid and real to its members as civilization is to us."

In the ''American Quarter'' article ''California's Literary Regionalism'', Autumn 1955, George R. Stewart is seen as a "humanist in the old classical sense. His novels, ''Storm'', ''Fire'', ''East of the Giants'', ''Earth Abides'', demonstrate the complex interlocking of topography, climate, and human society; and their general tone is objective and optimistic."

==References to other works==
The book makes a reference to ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' and ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]''. Ish compares the situations within these books to what he is going through. He finds Robinson Crusoe less appealing, because "his religious preoccupations seemed boring and rather silly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |page=90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He looks at the ship in the ''Swiss Family Robinson'' as an "infinite grab-bag from which at any time they might take exactly what they wanted,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn= |pages=90–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is similar to the situation of those living after the Great Disaster.

Stewart also mentions ''[[Ecclesiastes]]'' 1:4 in the title and theme: "Men go and come, but Earth abides".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Earth Abides |last=Stewart |first=George R. |authorlink= |year=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=  |nopp=true|page=title page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Engineering''' is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and [[empirical evidence]] to the [[innovation]], [[design]], [[construction]], operation and [[Maintenance (technical)|maintenance]] of [[structure]]s, [[machine]]s, [[material]]s, devices, [[system]]s, [[process]]es, and [[organization]]s for the benefit of humankind. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized [[List of engineering branches|fields of engineering]], each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of [[applied mathematics]], [[applied science]], and types of application. See [[glossary of engineering]].

The term ''engineering'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'', meaning "cleverness" and  ''ingeniare'', meaning "to contrive, devise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IAENG|url=http://www.iaeng.org/about_IAENG.html|website=iaeng.org|publisher=International Association of Engineers|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of engineering}}
[[File:Grondplan citadel Lille.JPG|thumb|Relief map of the [[Citadel of Lille]], designed in 1668 by [[Vauban]], the foremost military engineer of his age.]]

Engineering has existed since ancient times, when humans devised inventions such as the wedge, lever, wheel and pulley.

The term ''engineering''  is derived from the word ''engineer'', which itself dates back to 1390 when an ''engine'er'' (literally, one who operates an ''engine'') referred to "a constructor of military engines."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|engineer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, now obsolete, an "engine" referred to a military machine, ''i.e.'', a mechanical contraption used in war (for example, a [[catapult]]). Notable examples of the obsolete usage which have survived to the present day are military engineering corps, ''e.g.'', the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]].

The word "engine" itself is of even older origin, ultimately deriving from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium'' (c. 1250), meaning "innate quality, especially mental power, hence a clever invention."&lt;ref&gt;Origin: 1250–1300; ME engin &lt; AF, OF &lt; L ingenium nature, innate quality, esp. mental power, hence a clever invention, equiv. to in- + -genium, equiv. to gen- begetting; Source: Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House, Inc. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, as the design of civilian structures, such as bridges and buildings, matured as a technical discipline, the term [[civil engineering]]&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; entered the lexicon as a way to distinguish between those specializing in the construction of such non-military projects and those involved in the discipline of [[military engineering]].

===Ancient era===
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Romans built [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] to bring a steady supply of clean and fresh water to cities and towns in the empire.]]
The [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] in [[Egypt]], the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and the [[Parthenon]] in [[Greece]], the [[Roman aqueduct]]s, [[Via Appia]] and the [[Colosseum]], [[Teotihuacán]], the [[Great Wall of China]], the [[Brihadeeswarar Temple]] of [[Thanjavur]], among many others, stand as a testament to the ingenuity and skill of ancient civil and military engineers. Other monuments, no longer standing, such as the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]], and the [[Pharos of Alexandria]] were important engineering achievements of their time and were considered among the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]].

The earliest civil engineer known by name is [[Imhotep]].&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; As one of the officials of the [[Pharaoh]], [[Djoser|Djosèr]], he probably designed and supervised the construction of the [[Pyramid of Djoser]] (the [[Step Pyramid]]) at [[Saqqara]] in [[History of ancient Egypt|Egypt]] around [[27th century BC|2630]]–[[27th century BC|2611 BC]].&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Barry J. |author-link=Barry J.

Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] or [[epicyclic gearing]], two key principles in machine theory that helped design the [[gear train]]s of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as [[robotics]] and [[automotive engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hungarian armies employed military machines and inventions such as [[artillery]] which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/244231/ancient-Greece/261062/Military-technology Britannica on Greek civilization in the 5th century Military technology] Quote: "The 7th century, by contrast, had witnessed rapid innovations, such as the introduction of the hoplite and the trireme, which still were the basic instruments of war in the 5th." and "But it was the development of artillery that opened an epoch, and this invention did not predate the 4th century. It was first heard of in the context of Sicilian warfare against Carthage in the time of Dionysius I of Syracuse."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[trireme]], the [[ballista]] and the [[catapult]]. In the Middle Ages, the [[trebuchet]] was developed.

===Renaissance era===
[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore, ca. 1556]]
Before the development of modern engineering, mathematics was used by artisans and craftsmen, such as [[millwright]]s, clock makers, instrument makers and surveyors.  Aside from these professions, universities were not believed to have had much practical significance to technology.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

A standard reference for the state of mechanical arts during the Renaissance is given in the mining engineering treatise ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556), which also contains sections on geology, mining and chemistry.  ''De re metallica'' was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;

===Modern era===
The science of [[classical mechanics]], sometimes called Newtonian mechanics, formed the scientific basis of much of modern engineering.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"&gt;{{cite book|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution |last=Musson |author2=Robinso|year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press|location= |isbn= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the rise of engineering as a [[profession]] in the 18th century, the term became more narrowly applied to fields in which mathematics and science were applied to these ends. Similarly, in addition to military and civil engineering, the fields then known as the [[mechanic arts]] became incorporated into engineering.

Canal building was an important engineering work during the early phases of the Industrial Revolution.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815-1860 |last=Taylor|first= George Rogers|year=1969 |publisher =|location=
|isbn= 978-0873321013|pages=}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smeaton]] was the first self-proclaimed civil engineer and is often regarded as the "father" of [[civil engineering]]. He was an English [[civil engineer]] responsible for the design of [[bridge]]s, [[canal]]s, [[harbour]]s, and [[lighthouse]]s. He was also a capable [[mechanical engineer]] and an eminent [[physicist]]. Using a model water wheel, Smeaton conducted experiments for seven years, determining ways to increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Most Powerful Idea in the World: A Story of Steam, Industry and Invention|last1=Rosen|first1= William|year= 2012 |publisher = University Of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0226726342 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}   Smeaton introduced iron axles and gears to water wheels.&lt;ref name="Robinson-Musnon"/&gt;{{rp|69}} Smeaton also made mechanical improvements to the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine|Newcomn steam engine]]. Smeaton designed the third [[Eddystone Lighthouse]] (1755–59) where he pioneered the use of '[[hydraulic lime]]' (a form of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] which will set under water) and developed a technique involving dovetailed blocks of granite in the building of the lighthouse. He is important in the history, rediscovery of, and development of modern [[cement]], because he identified the compositional requirements needed to obtain "hydraulicity" in lime; work which led ultimately to the invention of [[Portland cement]].

Applied science lead to the development of the steam engine.  The sequence of events began with the invention the [[barometer]] and the measurement of atmospheric pressure by [[Evangelista Torricelli]] in 1643, demonstration of the force of atmospheric pressure by [[Otto von Guericke]] using the [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] in 1656, laboratory experiments by [[Denis Papin]], who  built experimental model steam engines and demonstrated the use of a piston, which he published in 1707.  [[Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester]] published a book of 100 inventions containing a method for raising waters similar to a [[coffee percolator]].  [[Samuel Morland]], a mathematician and inventor who worked on pumps, left notes at the Vauxhall Ordinance Office on a steam pump design that [[Thomas Savery]] read.

The application of steam powered cast iron blowing cylinders for providing pressurized air for [[blast furnace]]s lead to a large increase in iron production in the late 18th century.  The higher furnace temperatures made possible with steam powered blast allowed for the use of more lime in [[blast furnace]]s, which enabled the transition from charcoal to [[coke (fuel)|coke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Metallurgy, Second Edition |last=Tylecote |first=R.F. |year=  1992|publisher =Maney Publishing, for the Institute of Materials |location= London|isbn=978-0901462886|}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These innovations lowered the cost of iron, making [[Wagonway|horse railways]] and iron bridges practical.  The [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling process]], patented by [[Henry Cort]] in 1784 produced large scale quantities of wrought iron.  [[Hot blast]], patented by [[James Beaumont Neilson]] in 1828, greatly lowered the amount of fuel needed to smelt iron.

[[File:The world's first iron bridge.jpg|thumb|253px|The application of the steam engine allowed coke to be substituted for charcoal in iron making, lowering the cost of iron, which provided engineers with a new material for building bridges.  This bridge was made of [[cast iron]], which was soon displaced by less brittle [[wrought iron]] as a structural material]]

One of the most famous engineers of the mid 19th century was [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], who built railroads, dockyards and steamships.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] created a demand for machinery with metal parts, which led to the development of several [[machine tools]]. Boring cast iron cylinders with precision was not possible until [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] invented his [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)#Boring machine for steam engines|boring machine]], which is considered the  first [[machine tool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Roe | first = Joseph Wickham | title = English and American Tool Builders | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1916 | location = New Haven, Connecticut | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage | lccn = 16011753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other machine tools included the [[screw cutting lathe]], [[milling machine]], [[turret lathe]] and the [[Planer (metalworking)|metal planer]].  Precision machining techniques were developed in the first half of the 19th century.  These included the use of gigs to guide the machining tool over the work and fixtures to hold the work in the proper position.  Machine tools and machining techniques capable of producing [[interchangeable parts]] lead to [[Mass production|large scale factory production]] by the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundations of [[electrical engineering]] in the 1800s included the experiments of [[Alessandro Volta]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Georg Ohm]] and others and the invention of the [[electrical telegraph|electric telegraph]] in 1816 and the [[electric motor]] in 1872. The theoretical work of [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] (see: [[Maxwell's equations]]) and [[Heinrich Hertz]] in the late 19th century gave rise to the field of [[electronics]]. The later inventions of the [[vacuum tube]] and the [[transistor]] further accelerated the development of electronics to such an extent that electrical and electronics engineers currently outnumber their colleagues of any other engineering specialty.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;
[[Chemical engineering]] developed in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; Industrial scale manufacturing demanded new materials and new processes and by 1880 the need for large scale production of chemicals was such that a new industry was created, dedicated to the development and large scale manufacturing of chemicals in new industrial plants.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt; The role of the chemical engineer was the design of these chemical plants and processes.&lt;ref name="ECPD Definition on Britannica"/&gt;

Aeronautical engineering deals with [[aircraft design process]] design while [[aerospace engineering]] is a more modern term that expands the reach of the discipline by including [[spacecraft]] design. Its origins can be traced back to the aviation pioneers around the start of the 20th century although the work of [[Sir George Cayley]] has recently been dated as being from the last decade of the 18th century. Early knowledge of aeronautical engineering was largely empirical with some concepts and skills imported from other branches of engineering.&lt;ref name="americana"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | author = Van Every, Kermit E. | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana | title = Aeronautical engineering| edition =| year = 1986| publisher = Grolier Incorporated| volume =1| pages = 226 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in engineering (technically, ''applied science and engineering'') awarded in the United States went to [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] at [[Yale University]] in 1863; it was also the second PhD awarded in science in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;

Only a decade after the successful flights by the [[Wright brothers]], there was extensive development of aeronautical engineering through development of military aircraft that were used in [[World War I]]. Meanwhile, research to provide fundamental background science continued by combining [[theoretical physics]] with experiments.

Engineering is a broad discipline which is often broken down into several sub-disciplines. Although an engineer will usually be trained in a specific discipline, he or she may become multi-disciplined through experience. Engineering is often characterized as having four main branches:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hy9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;dq=In+most+universities+it+should+be+possible+to+cover+the+main+branches+of+engineering,+ie+civil,+mechanical,+electrical+and+chemical+engineering+in+this+way.&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2UkYTff0MZL-ngfesbGMDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA Journal of the British Nuclear Energy Society: Volume 1 British Nuclear Energy Society – 1962 – Snippet view] Quote: In most universities it should be possible to cover the main branches of engineering, i.e. civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering in this way.

===Chemical engineering===
{{Main|Chemical engineering}}
[[Chemical engineering]] is the application of physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering principles in order to carry out chemical processes on a commercial scale, such as the manufacture of [[commodity chemicals]], [[specialty chemicals]], [[Oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[microfabrication]], [[fermentation]], and [[Biotechnology|biomolecule production]].

===Civil engineering===
{{Main|Civil engineering}}
[[Civil engineering]] is the design and construction of public and private works, such as [[infrastructure]] ([[airports]], [[roads]], [[railways]], water supply, and treatment etc.), [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, dams, and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |accessdate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archivedate=16 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.org.uk/careers-and-professional-development/what-is-civil-engineering|title=What is Civil Engineering|publisher=[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including [[structural engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and [[surveying]].

Garth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical engineering===
{{Main|Electrical engineering}}
[[Electrical engineering]] is the design, study, and manufacture of various electrical and electronic systems, such as [[Broadcast engineering]], [[electrical circuit]]s, [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[Electric motor|motors]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]]/[[electromechanical]] devices, [[electronic devices]], [[electronic circuits]], [[optical fiber]]s, [[optoelectronic device]]s, [[computer]] systems, [[telecommunications]], instrumentation, controls, and [[electronics]].

===Mechanical engineering===
{{Main|Mechanical engineering}}
[[Mechanical engineering]] is the design and manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and [[energy]] systems, [[aerospace]]/[[aircraft]] products, [[weapon systems]], [[transportation]] products, [[Internal combustion engine|engines]], [[gas compressor|compressors]], [[powertrain]]s, [[kinematic chain]]s, vacuum technology, [[vibration isolation]] equipment, [[manufacturing]], and [[mechatronics]].

===Other branches===
{{Main|List of engineering branches}}
Beyond these "Big 4", a number of other branches are recognized, though many can be thought of as sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple.  Historically, [[naval architecture|naval engineering]] and [[mining engineering]] were major branches.  Other engineering fields are [[manufacturing engineering]], [[acoustical engineering]], [[corrosion engineering]], [[instrumentation and control]], [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[Automotive engineering|automotive]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]], [[petroleum engineering|petroleum]], [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[audio engineering|audio]], [[software engineering|software]], [[architectural engineering|architectural]], [[agricultural engineering|agricultural]], [[biosystems engineering|biosystems]], [[biomedical engineering|biomedical]],&lt;ref&gt;Bronzino JD, ed., The Biomedical Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8493-2121-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geological engineering|geological]], [[Textile manufacturing|textile]], [[industrial engineering|industrial]], [[materials science|materials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bensaude-Vincent|first1=Bernadette|title=The construction of a discipline: Materials science in the United States|journal=Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences|date=March 2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=223–48|doi=10.1525/hsps.2001.31.2.223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[nuclear engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162436/http://www.careercornerstone.org/pdf/nuclear/nuceng.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK [[Engineering Council]].

New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, [[Earth systems engineering and management]] involves a wide range of subject areas including [[engineering studies]], [[environmental science]], [[engineering ethics]] and [[philosophy of engineering]].

==Practice==
One who practices engineering is called an [[engineer]], and those licensed to do so may have more formal designations such as [[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer]], [[Incorporated Engineer]], [[Ingenieur]], [[European Engineer]], or [[Federal Aviation Administration#Designated Engineering Representative (DER)|Designated Engineering Representative]].

==Methodology==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg|thumb|right|Design of a [[turbine]] requires collaboration of engineers from many fields, as the system involves mechanical, electro-magnetic and chemical processes. The [[turbine blade|blades]], [[stator|rotor and stator]] as well as the [[steam cycle]] all need to be carefully designed and optimized.]]

In the [[engineering design]] process, engineers apply mathematics and sciences such as physics to find novel solutions to problems or to improve existing solutions. More than ever, engineers are now required to have a proficient knowledge of relevant sciences for their design projects. As a result, many engineers continue to learn new material throughout their career.

If multiple solutions exist, engineers weigh each design choice based on their merit and choose the solution that best matches the requirements. The crucial and unique task of the engineer is to identify, understand, and interpret the constraints on a design in order to yield a successful result. It is generally insufficient to build a technically successful product, rather, it must also meet further requirements.

Constraints may include available resources, physical, imaginative or technical limitations, flexibility for future modifications and additions, and other factors, such as requirements for cost, [[Safety engineering|safety]], marketability, productivity, and [[Serviceability (computer)|serviceability]]. By understanding the constraints, engineers derive [[specifications]] for the limits within which a viable object or system may be produced and operated.

A general methodology and [[epistemology]] of engineering can be inferred from the historical case studies and comments provided by Walter Vincenti.&lt;ref&gt;Vincenti, Walter G. (1993-02-01). What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History. The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-4588-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Vincenti's case studies are from the domain of aeronautical engineering, his conclusions can be transferred into many other branches of engineering, too.

According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the "''engineering method'' is the use of heuristics to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources." Koen argues that the definition of what makes one an engineer should not be based on what she produces, but rather how she goes about it.&lt;ref name="Discussion of The Method"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koen|first1=Billy Vaughn|title=Discussion of The Method|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-515599-0|page=8|edition=1|url=https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/discussion-of-the-method-9780195155990|accessdate=23 July 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem solving===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
[[File:Booster-Layout.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|A drawing for a booster engine for [[steam locomotive]]s. Engineering is applied to [[design]], with emphasis on function and the utilization of mathematics and science.]]
Engineers use their knowledge of [[science]], [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[economics]], and [[empirical knowledge|appropriate experience]] or [[tacit knowledge]] to find suitable solutions to a problem. Creating an appropriate [[mathematical model]] of a problem often allows them to analyze it (sometimes definitively), and to test potential solutions.

Usually, multiple reasonable solutions exist, so engineers must evaluate the different [[design choice]]s on their merits and choose the solution that best meets their requirements. [[Genrich Altshuller]], after gathering statistics on a large number of [[patent]]s, suggested that [[compromise]]s are at the heart of "[[level of invention|low-level]]" engineering designs, while at a higher level the best design is one which eliminates the core contradiction causing the problem.

Engineers typically attempt to predict how well their designs will perform to their specifications prior to full-scale production. They use, among other things: [[prototype]]s, [[scale model]]s, [[simulation]]s, [[destructive testing|destructive tests]], [[nondestructive testing|nondestructive tests]], and [[stress testing|stress tests]]. Testing ensures that products will perform as expected.

Engineers take on the responsibility of producing designs that will perform as well as expected and will not cause unintended harm to the public at large. Engineers typically include a [[factor of safety]] in their designs to reduce the risk of unexpected failure. However, the greater the safety factor, the less efficient the design may be.{{Citation needed|reason=Kindly provide citation. Usually safety factor is considered to be a part of an efficient design.|date=October 2017}}

The study of failed products is known as [[forensic engineering]] and can help the [[product design]]er in evaluating his or her design in the light of real conditions. The discipline is of greatest value after disasters, such as [[bridge collapse]]s, when careful analysis is needed to establish the cause or causes of the failure.

===Computer use===
[[File:CFD Shuttle.jpg|thumb|right|A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around a [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] during re-entry. Solutions to the flow require [[Finite element method|modelling]] of the combined effects of [[Navier–Stokes equations|fluid flow]] and the [[heat equation]]s.]]

As with all modern scientific and technological endeavors, computers and software play an increasingly important role. As well as the typical business [[application software]] there are a number of computer aided applications ([[computer-aided technologies]]) specifically for engineering. Computers can be used to generate models of fundamental physical processes, which can be solved using [[numerical method]]s.

One of the most widely used [[design tool]]s in the profession is [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) software like [[CATIA]], [[Autodesk Inventor]], DSS [[SolidWorks]] or [[Pro Engineer]] which enables engineers to create 3D models, 2D drawings, and schematics of their designs. CAD together with [[digital mockup]] (DMU) and [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] software such as [[Finite element method|finite element method analysis]] or [[analytic element method]] allows engineers to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes.

These allow products and components to be checked for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and kinematics. Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized with the use of [[product data management]] software.&lt;ref&gt;

There are also many tools to support specific engineering tasks such as [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM) software to generate [[CNC]] machining instructions; [[manufacturing process management]] software for production engineering; [[Electronic design automation|EDA]] for [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and circuit [[schematic]]s for electronic engineers; [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|MRO]] applications for maintenance management; and Architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) software for civil engineering.

In recent years the use of computer software to aid the development of goods has collectively come to be known as [[product lifecycle management]] (PLM).&lt;ref&gt;

The engineering profession engages in a wide range of activities, from large collaboration at the societal level, and also smaller individual projects.  Almost all engineering projects are obligated to some sort of financing agency: a company, a set of investors, or a government.  The few types of engineering that are minimally constrained by such issues are ''[[pro bono]]'' engineering and [[open design|open-design]] engineering.

By its very nature engineering has interconnections with society, culture and human behavior.  Every product or construction used by modern society is influenced by engineering. The results of engineering activity influence changes to the environment, society and economies, and its application brings with it a responsibility and public safety.

Engineering projects can be subject to controversy. Examples from different engineering disciplines include the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s, the [[Three Gorges Dam]], the design and use of [[sport utility vehicle]]s and the extraction of [[Fuel oil|oil]]. In response, some western engineering companies have enacted serious [[Corporate social responsibility|corporate and social responsibility]] policies.

Engineering is a key driver of innovation and human development. Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, has a very small engineering capacity which results in many African nations being unable to develop crucial infrastructure without outside aid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The attainment of many of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] requires the achievement of sufficient engineering capacity to develop infrastructure and sustainable technological development.&lt;ref name="MDG"&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006054029/http://www.sistech.co.uk/media/ICEBrunelLecture2006.pdf?Docu_id=1420&amp;faculty=14 |archivedate=2006-10-06|deadurl =yes|title = Engineering Civilisation from the Shadows|last = Jowitt|first = Paul W.|date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All overseas development and relief NGOs make considerable use of engineers to apply solutions in disaster and development scenarios. A number of charitable organizations aim to use engineering directly for the good of mankind:
* [[Engineers Without Borders]]
* [[Engineers Against Poverty]]
* Registered Engineers for Disaster Relief
* [[Engineers for a Sustainable World]]
* [[Engineering for Change]]
* Engineering Ministries International&lt;ref name="EMI"&gt;[http://www.emiusa.org/index.html Home page for EMI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014038/http://emiusa.org/index.html |date=2012-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engineering companies in many established economies are facing significant challenges with regard to the number of professional engineers being trained, compared with the number retiring.  This problem is very prominent in the UK where engineering has a poor image and low status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|title=engineeringuk.com/About_us|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530210132/http://www.engineeringuk.com/About_us/|archivedate=2014-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many negative economic and political issues that this can cause, as well as ethical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140619142335/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/policy/why-does-it-matter-why-are-engineering-skills-important |archivedate=2014-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely agreed that the engineering profession faces an "image crisis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103241/http://www.georgededwards.co.uk/the-era-foundation-report.html |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than it being fundamentally an unattractive career.  Much work is needed to avoid huge problems in the UK and other western economies.

===Code of ethics===
{{Main|Engineering ethics}}
Many [[Engineering society|engineering societies]] have established codes of practice and [[engineering ethics|codes of ethics]] to guide members and inform the public at large.  The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] code of ethics states:
{{quote| Engineering is an important and learned profession. As members of this profession, engineers are expected to exhibit the highest standards of honesty and integrity. Engineering has a direct and vital impact on the quality of life for all people. Accordingly, the services provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness, and equity, and must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. Engineers must perform under a standard of professional behavior that requires adherence to the highest principles of ethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics|title=Code of Ethics|publisher=National Society of Professional Engineers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There exists an overlap between the sciences and engineering practice; in engineering, one applies science. Both areas of endeavor rely on accurate observation of materials and phenomena.  Both use mathematics and classification criteria to analyze and communicate observations.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Scientists may also have to complete engineering tasks, such as designing experimental apparatus or building prototypes. Conversely, in the process of developing technology engineers sometimes find themselves exploring new phenomena, thus becoming, for the moment, scientists or more precisely "engineering scientists".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the book ''[[What Engineers Know and How They Know It]]'',&lt;ref name="vincenti"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincenti|first=Walter G. |title=What Engineers Know and How They Know It: Analytical Studies from Aeronautical History|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-0-8018-3974-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Vincenti asserts that engineering research has a character different from that of scientific research.  First, it often deals with areas in which the basic [[physics]] or [[chemistry]] are well understood, but the problems themselves are too complex to solve in an exact manner.

An example of this is the use of numerical approximations to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to describe aerodynamic flow over an aircraft, or the use of [[Fatigue (material)|Miner's rule]] to calculate fatigue damage. Second, engineering research employs many semi-[[empirical methods]] that are foreign to pure scientific research, one example being the method of parameter variation.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

As stated by Fung ''et al.'' in the revision to the classic engineering text ''Foundations of Solid Mechanics'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Engineering is quite different from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make things that do not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined.  In the past engineers working on new designs found that they did not have all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.&lt;ref name="Fung"&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical and Computational Solid Mechanics, YC Fung and P. Tong|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although engineering solutions make use of scientific principles, engineers must also take into account safety, efficiency, economy, reliability, and constructability or ease of fabrication as well as the environment, ethical and legal considerations such as patent infringement or liability in the case of failure of the solution.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Medicine and biology===
[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - presumed self-portrait - WGA12798.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], seen here in a self-portrait, has been described as the epitome of the artist/engineer.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"/&gt; He is also known for his studies on [[human anatomy]] and [[physiology]].]]

The study of the human body, albeit from different directions and for different purposes, is an important common link between medicine and some engineering disciplines. [[Medicine]] aims to sustain, repair, enhance and even replace functions of the [[human body]], if necessary, through the use of [[technology]].

[[File:GFP Mice 01.jpg|thumb|right|Genetically engineered mice expressing [[green fluorescent protein]], which glows green under blue light. The central mouse is [[wild-type]].]]
Modern medicine can replace several of the body's functions through the use of artificial organs and can significantly alter the function of the human body through artificial devices such as, for example, [[brain implant]]s and [[Artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]].&lt;ref name="Boston U"&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Bioe/BioeMcGe.htm Ethical Assessment of Implantable Brain Chips. Ellen M. McGee and G.Q. Maguire, Jr. from Boston University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE foreign parts"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel5/2188/27125/01204814.pdf?arnumber=1204814 IEEE technical paper: Foreign parts (electronic body implants).by Evans-Pughe, C. quote from summary: Feeling threatened by cyborgs?]&lt;/ref&gt; The fields of [[bionics]] and medical bionics are dedicated to the study of synthetic implants pertaining to natural systems.

Conversely, some engineering disciplines view the human body as a biological machine worth studying and are dedicated to emulating many of its functions by replacing [[biology]] with technology. This has led to fields such as [[artificial intelligence]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy logic]], and [[robot]]ics.  There are also substantial interdisciplinary interactions between engineering and medicine.&lt;ref name="IME"&gt;[http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html Institute of Medicine and Engineering: Mission statement The mission of the Institute for Medicine and Engineering (IME) is to stimulate fundamental research at the interface between biomedicine and engineering/physical/computational sciences leading to innovative applications in biomedical research and clinical practice.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317145554/http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/ime/mission.html |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEEE"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=51 IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology: Both general and technical articles on current technologies and methods used in biomedical and clinical engineering&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt;

Both fields provide solutions to real world problems. This often requires moving forward before phenomena are completely understood in a more rigorous scientific sense and therefore experimentation and [[empirical]] knowledge is an integral part of both.

Medicine, in part, studies the function of the human body. The human body, as a biological machine, has many functions that can be modeled using engineering methods.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"&gt;[http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf Royal Academy of Engineering and Academy of Medical Sciences: Systems Biology: a vision for engineering and medicine in pdf: quote1: Systems Biology is an emerging methodology that has yet to be defined quote2: It applies the concepts of systems engineering to the study of complex biological systems through iteration between computational or mathematical modelling and experimentation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070410011033/http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/images/pressRelease/1170256174.pdf |date=2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart for example functions much like a pump,&lt;ref name="Science Museum of Minnesota"&gt;[http://www.smm.org/heart/lessons/lesson5a.htm Science Museum of Minnesota: Online Lesson 5a; The heart as a pump]&lt;/ref&gt; the skeleton is like a linked structure with levers,&lt;ref name="Minnesota State University emuseum"&gt;[http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/biology/humananatomy/skeletal/skeletalsystem.html Minnesota State University emuseum: Bones act as levers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220001131/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/biology/humananatomy/skeletal/skeletalsystem.html |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the brain produces [[Signal (electrical engineering)|electrical signals]] etc.&lt;ref name="UC Berkeley News"&gt;[http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/02/23_brainwaves.shtml UC Berkeley News: UC researchers create model of brain's electrical storm during a seizure]&lt;/ref&gt; These similarities as well as the increasing importance and application of engineering principles in medicine, led to the development of the field of [[biomedical engineering]] that uses concepts developed in both disciplines.

Newly emerging branches of science, such as [[systems biology]], are adapting analytical tools traditionally used for engineering, such as systems modeling and computational analysis, to the description of biological systems.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy"/&gt;

===Art===

There are connections between engineering and art, for example, [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]] and [[industrial design]] (even to the extent that these disciplines may sometimes be included in a university's [[Faculty (division)|Faculty]] of Engineering).&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=107990&amp;org=NSF National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering: Professor uses the fine arts to broaden students' engineering perspectives]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT World:The Art of Engineering"&gt;[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ MIT World:The Art of Engineering: Inventor James Dyson on the Art of Engineering: quote: A member of the British Design Council, James Dyson has been designing products since graduating from the Royal College of Art in 1970.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705232213/http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/362/ |date=2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="University of Texas at Dallas"&gt;[http://iiae.utdallas.edu/ University of Texas at Dallas:  The Institute for Interactive Arts and Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Art Institute of Chicago]], for instance, held an exhibition about the art of [[NASA]]'s aerospace design.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/nasa/overview.html Aerospace Design: The Art of Engineering from NASA's Aeronautical Research]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Maillart]]'s bridge design is perceived by some to have been deliberately artistic.&lt;ref name="Princeton U"&gt;[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/137.html Princeton U: Robert Maillart's Bridges: The Art of Engineering: quote: no doubt that Maillart was fully conscious of the aesthetic implications&amp;nbsp;...]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of South Florida]], an engineering professor, through a grant with the [[National Science Foundation]], has developed a course that connects art and engineering.&lt;ref name="National Science Foundation:The Art of Engineering"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chief engineer"&gt;[http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm quote:..the tools of artists and the perspective of engineers..] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180822/http://www.chiefengineer.org/content/content_display.cfm/seqnumber_content/2697.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among famous historical figures, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a well-known [[Renaissance]] artist and engineer, and a prime example of the nexus between art and engineering.&lt;ref name="Bjerklie, David"&gt;Bjerklie, David.  "The Art of Renaissance Engineering."  ''MIT's Technology Review'' Jan./Feb.1998: 54–59.  Article explores the concept of the "artist-engineer", an individual who used his artistic talent in engineering. Quote from article: Da Vinci reached the pinnacle of "artist-engineer"-dom, Quote2: "It was Leonardo da Vinci who initiated the most ambitious expansion in the role of artist-engineer, progressing from astute observer to inventor to theoretician." (Bjerklie 58)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drew U"&gt;[http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm Drew U: user website: cites Bjerklie paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419194433/http://www.users.drew.edu/~ejustin/leonardo.htm |date=2007-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

[[Business Engineering]] deals with the relationship between professional engineering, IT systems, business administration and [[change management]]. [[Engineering management]] or "Management engineering" is a specialized field of [[management]] concerned with engineering practice or the engineering industry sector.  The demand for management-focused engineers (or from the opposite perspective, managers with an understanding of engineering), has resulted in the development of specialized engineering management degrees that develop the knowledge and skills needed for these roles. During an engineering management course, students will develop [[industrial engineering]] skills, knowledge, and expertise, alongside knowledge of business administration, management techniques, and strategic thinking.  Engineers specializing in change management must have in-depth knowledge of the application of [[industrial and organizational psychology]] principles and methods.  Professional engineers often train as [[certified management consultant]]s in the very specialized field of [[management consulting]] applied to engineering practice or the engineering sector.  This work often deals with large scale complex [[business transformation]] or [[Business process management]] initiatives in aerospace and defence, automotive, oil and gas, machinery, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, electrical &amp; electronics, power distribution &amp; generation, utilities and transportation systems.  This combination of technical engineering practice, management consulting practice, industry sector knowledge, and change management expertise enables professional engineers who are also qualified as management consultants to lead major business transformation initiatives. These initiatives are typically sponsored by C-level executives.

===Other fields===
In [[political science]], the term ''engineering'' has been borrowed for the study of the subjects of [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[political engineering]], which deal with forming [[political structure|political]] and [[social structure]]s using engineering methodology coupled with [[political science]] principles. [[Financial engineering]] has similarly borrowed the term.

In the context of [[data visualization]], a [[glyph]]  is any marker, such as an arrow or similar marking, used to specify part of a [[scientific visualization|visualization]]. This is a representation to visualize data where the data set is presented as a collection of visual objects. These visual objects are collectively called a Glyph.

{{Quotation |In the context of data visualization, a glyph is the visual representation of a piece of data where the attributes of a graphical entity are dictated by one or more attributes of a data record. |Matthew O. Ward |Multivariate data glyphs: Principles and practice| In: ''Handbook of data visualization'' (2008), p.180. }}

== Information Visualization (InfoVis) ==

=== Constructing Glyphs ===
Glyph construction can be a complex process when there are many dimensions to be represented in the visualization. Maguire et al proposed a taxonomy based approach to glyph-design that uses a tree to guide the visual encodings used to representation various data items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maguire|first=E.|last2=Rocca-Serra|first2=P.|last3=Sansone|first3=S.

=== Examples ===

==== Simple Glyphs ====

==== Complex Glyphs ====

Duffy et al created perhaps one of the most complex glyph representations with their representation of sperm movement.

== Scientific Visualization (SciVis) ==

=== Key Advantages ===
It helps visualizing data relation in Data Analysis, Statistics, etc. by using any custom notation.

The '''Institute for Experimental Mathematics (IEM)''' was founded, with the support of the [[Volkswagen]]
Foundation, as a central scientific facility of the former University of Essen, now [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] in 1989.  With the addition of the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]] Foundation Chair on 1 January 1999, the Institute was expanded in the area of Computer Networking Technology. [[A.J. Han Vinck]] is currently the Institute's managing director.

The primary objective of the Institute is to foster interactions between the fields of mathematics, computer science and the engineering sciences. Mathematicians, computer experts and telecommunications engineers are engaged in trans-disciplinary collaboration under one roof. The main areas of research are [[discrete mathematics]], [[number theory]], [[data transmission|digital communication]], and [[computer network|computer networking technology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1979">'''LEEP Online Education''' is a [[distance learning]] program offered by the UIUC iSchool (formerly GSLIS [Graduate School of Library and Information Science]) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

The LEEP program provides students who are not able to relocate to the [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]-[[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] area a means to attend the university's [[American Library Association|ALA]]-accredited [[Master of Library and Information Science]], Master of Information Science or [[Certificate of Advanced Study]] (CAS) program. The program, and the iSchool overall, is ranked #1 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

==History==

The [[acronym]] LEEP originally stood for Library Education Experimental Program. Founded in 1995, the program is no longer considered experimental.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine A. Thompson, [http://www.nelibraries.org/200606/200606-thompson.htm "LEEPing to an Advanced Library School Degree,"] ''New England Libraries'', Vol. 2, No. 5 (June, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coursework==
LEEP differentiates itself from other distance learning [[library and information science|library and information science (LIS)]] programs through the integration of brief periods of on-campus participation, [[Internet]] instruction through synchronous sessions, and independent learning. Off-campus students attend classes via the school's [[Moodle]] Virtual Learning Environment (VIS) and the Blackboard Collaborate platform. With the 21st LEEP cohort, beginning in the summer/fall of 2016, the on-campus participation was condensed to a weekend program (as opposed to a week+).

The '''law of the handicap of a head start''' (original [[dutch language|Dutch]]: ''[[:nl:Wet van de remmende voorsprong|Wet van de remmende voorsprong]]'') or '''dialectics of lead''' is a theory that suggests that an initial [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] in a given area may result in a handicap in the long term. The term was coined in 1937 by [[Jan Romein]], a Dutch [[journalist]] and [[historian]], in his essay "The dialectics of progress" ("De dialectiek van de vooruitgang"), part of the series ''The unfinished past'' (''Het onvoltooid verleden'').

==The phenomenon==
The ''law of the handicap of a head start'' describes a [[phenomenon]] that is applicable in numerous settings. The [[Principle|law]] suggests that making progress in a particular area often creates circumstances in which stimuli are lacking to strive for further progress. This results in the individual or group that started out ahead eventually being overtaken by others. In the [[terminology]] of the law, the ''head start'', initially an advantage, subsequently becomes a ''handicap''. 

An explanation for why the phenomenon occurs is that when a society dedicates itself to certain standards, and those standards change, it is harder for them to [[Adaptation|adapt]]. Conversely, a society that has not committed itself yet will not have this problem. Thus, a society that at one point has a head start over other societies, may, at a later time, be stuck with [[Obsolescence|obsolete]] [[technology]] or ideas that get in the way of further progress. One consequence of this is that what is considered to be the [[state of the art]] in a certain field can be seen as "jumping" from place to place, as each leader soon becomes a victim of the handicap. 

In common terms, societies, companies, and individuals are often confronted with the decision to either [[Investment|invest]] now and get a fast return, or put off the investment until a new technology has emerged and possibly make a bigger profit then. For example, a regular problem for individuals is the decision of when to buy a new [[computer]]. Since computer speed develops at a steady pace, delaying the investment for a year may mean having to make do with a slower (or no) computer for the first year, but after that the individual will be able to buy a better computer for the same price. In many cases, however, the technological development is not as predictable as this, so it is harder to make an informed decision.

A related law that can be considered as the contrary of this law is the ''Law of the stimulative arrears'' (''[[:nl:Wet van de stimulerende achterstand|Wet van de stimulerende achterstand]]'') published by Erik van der Hoeven in 1980.&lt;ref name=hoeven&gt;{{cite book|last=van der Hoeven|first=Erik|title=De wet van de stimulerende achterstand|year=1980|publisher=Bakker|location=[[Amsterdam]]|isbn=978-90-6019-742-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The author gives an example of the law in his original essay. During a trip to [[London]], he wonders why at that time it was still lit by [[Gas lighting|gas lamps]], rather than [[electric light]]s as were by then common in other [[Europe]]an capitals like [[Amsterdam]]. His explanation was that London's head start—their possession of street lights before most other cities—was now holding them back in replacing them with the more modern electric lights. As the streets were already lit there was no pressing need to replace gas lamps, despite the other advantages of electric lighting.

A modern example—an independent observation given not by the author—the internet situation in the US and Romania. Romania got access to the latest and the greatest equipment in a time where it hadn't laid down any cables, but the US has already done that in the past. Upgrades from the American point of view would like a waste of money, as their equipment is already "doing the job".{{OR|date=December 2017}}

'''''Lazzat Un Nisa''''' (from {{lang-ar|'''لذّتُ النّسا'''}} '''''The Pleasure of Woman''''') is an erotic Indian anecdote&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/07/10/stories/2003071000390100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jfine"&gt;''Lazzat Un Nisa'',translated by Jane Fine, 2002, Classex Books Private Limited, {{ISBN|81-7858-003-9}}, 121 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/07/10/stories/2003071000390100.htm The Hindu's article about Lazzat Un Nisa] retrieved Dec 06, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lazzat un-niso'' Nur publisher, 1991 {{ISBN|5-640-01094-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Persian language]]. It depicts the art of sex through the role of jewellery and perfume in [[lovemaking]], erotic writing as literature, and [[pornography]] as [[aphrodisiac]]. The Book was hand-illustrated and hand-copied in Urdu and Persian in 1850 by writer Mohammed Abdul Latif Muzdar Mehdune.

==History==
The original manuscript dates back to the [[Qutb Shahi]] period. In the fifteenth century, the court of [[Bidar]] patronized such erotic works as the [[Bhog bal]], [[Thadkirat al-Shahawat]] (List of aphrodisiacs) and [[Srngaramanjari]] (erotic Bouquets). Lizzat Un Nisa is one of the few surviving erotics works from the period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/019579334X/ Scent in the Islamic Garden: A Study of Deccani Urdu Literary Sources] {{ISBN|0-19-579334-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is another Kitab ul-Laddhat un-nisa which was written for a certain vizir Kukapondat by the same content and translated from Parsi into Russian. Actually the book itself has no pornographic or explicit sexual bias. It gives instructions how to classify women from their outer aspect starting from their apparel and ending with some parts of their body. In the Middle Ages Central Asia was the most important urbanized complex of cities and the area thrived of scientific research especially in the medical and terapeutic sciences (Avicenna and Rhazes were born there) and therefore it is very interesting to read which, maybe for a man living in these frantic cities, unexpected defaults could show up in the sexual life when making acquaintance with ladies and how he/she could recur to be treated by a doctor and by which special medical recipes. Lately this book became available in Italian with historical comments as per attached bibliography.

==Story==
The main subject of the story is a man named Harichand, who under orders of a king, embarks on a journey to collect exotic gifts and beautiful women for the pleasures of the king. The manuscript provides advice on various [[sexual techniques]].  It has a section on how to arouse a woman and observations based on sizes of a woman's vagina &lt;ref name="jfine"/&gt; and also a brief list of lengths of the phallus.

[[Image:Ole Bull's villa entrance stairs.jpg|thumb|Villa Lysøen entrance stairs]]

'''Lysøen''' is an island in the municipality of [[Os, Hordaland|Os]], [[Hordaland]], [[Norway]]. 
Lysøen is also the site of '''Villa Lysøen''' (''Ole Bulls villa på Lysøen''), the home of Norwegian violin-virtuoso and composer [[Ole Bull]] until his death in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergen-guide.com/55.htm ''Lysoen Island and Ole Bull's Villa'' (Bergen Guide)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Villa Lysøen==
The island was originally the site of a farm established around 1670. The island was bought by Ole Bull in 1872 who constructed the villa. Ole Bull drew the plans for the villa himself, under the supervision of renowned Norwegian architect [[Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe]] (1833–1901).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Conrad_Fredrik_von_der_Lippe  ''Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt; Ole Bull had a large villa built on the island, inspired by numerous architectural styles, including the [[Swiss chalet style]] and [[Moors|Moorish]] architecture. It has a tower formed as an [[onion dome]], common in Russian architecture, and many wooden carvings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/Lys%C3%B8en ''Lysøen'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ole Bull transformed his {{convert|175|acre|km2|adj=on}} island property into a fairy-tale kingdom by having romantic paths, ponds and [[gazebo]]s made by planting exotic trees and bushes in the native pine forest. The island has 13&amp;nbsp;km of walkways and paths. His second wife Sara Chapman Thorp (1850–1911) accompanied him to their summer villa on Lysøen.

The highest point on the island, 76 meters above sea level, is the site of a lookout tower which was built in 1903 by Ole Bull's [[United States|American]] descendants. In 1974, Bull's granddaughter Sylvea Bull Curtis of [[Connecticut]] donated the island to the [[Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments]]. Lysøen granted status as a museum in 1984 and has since been open to the public. Guided tours are conducted from early May to August.  The villa serves as a museum in the summer and is used for concerts during the annual [[Bergen International Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortidsminneforeningen-hordaland.no/lysoen.htm ''Museet Lysøen'' (Lysøen i Lysefjorden)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724181026/http://www.fortidsminneforeningen-hordaland.no/lysoen.htm |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause --&gt;
Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; This is often related to high food prices and [[poverty]].&lt;ref name=FFL2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; A lack of [[breastfeeding]] may contribute, as may a number of [[infectious diseases]] such as: [[gastroenteritis]], [[pneumonia]], [[malaria]], and [[measles]], which increase nutrient requirements.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; There are two main types of undernutrition: [[protein-energy malnutrition]] and dietary deficiencies.&lt;ref name=Jones2011/&gt; Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: [[marasmus]] (a lack of protein and calories) and [[kwashiorkor]] (a lack of just protein).&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of [[iron deficiency|iron]], [[iodine deficiency|iodine]], and [[vitamin A deficiency|vitamin A]].&lt;ref name=Young2012/&gt; During [[pregnancy]], due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Arora |editor-first1=Mala  |editor-last2=Konje |editor-first2=Justin C. |title=Recurrent pregnancy loss |date=2007 |publisher=Jaypee Bros.

Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, the term malnutrition refers to undernutrition for the remainder of this article. Malnutrition can be divided into two different types, SAM and MAM. SAM refers to children with severe acute malnutrition. MAM refers to moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Sathish Subramanian |author2=Sayeeda Huq |author3=Tanya Yatsunenko |author4=Rashidul Haque |author5=Mustafa Mahfuz |author6=Mohammed A.

===Undernutrition and overnutrition===
Malnutrition is caused by eating a diet in which [[nutrient]]s are ''not enough'' or is ''too much'' such that it causes health problems.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a category of diseases that includes undernutrition and [[overnutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO, nutrition experts take action on malnutrition |url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/pressnote_action_on_malnutrition/en/|work=World Health Organization |accessdate=February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overnutrition can result in [[obesity]] and being [[overweight]]. In some [[developing countries]], overnutrition in the form of [[obesity]] is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Progress For Children: A Report Card On Nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/files/Progress_for_Children_-_No._4.pdf|publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the term malnutrition is commonly used to refer to undernutrition only.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nikolaos Katsilambros|title=Clinical Nutrition in Practice|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-4777-7|pages=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJHU1m7BEP8C&amp;pg=PT46}}&lt;/ref&gt; This applies particularly to the context of development cooperation. Therefore, "malnutrition" in documents by the [[World Health Organization]], [[UNICEF]], [[Save the Children]] or other international [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) usually is equated to undernutrition.

===Protein-energy malnutrition===

Undernutrition is sometimes used as a synonym of [[protein–energy malnutrition]] (PEM).&lt;ref name="Young2012" /&gt; While other include both [[micronutrient deficiencies]] and protein energy malnutrition in its definition.&lt;ref name="Jones2011" /&gt; It differs from [[calorie restriction]] in that calorie restriction may not result in negative health effects. The term hypoalimentation means underfeeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000051473|hypoalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "severe malnutrition" or "severe undernutrition" is often used to refer specifically to [[protein–energy malnutrition|PEM]].&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last3=Walker |editor-first3=W. Allan |editor-first=Christopher |editor-last=Duggan |editor-first2=John B. |editor-last2=Watkins |title=Nutrition in pediatrics: basic science, clinical application|year=2008|publisher=BC Decker|location=Hamilton|isbn=978-1-55009-361-2|pages=127–141|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wSTISCdSIosC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Nutrition+in+pediatrics+:+basic+science,+clinical+application#v=onepage&amp;q=Nutrition%20in%20pediatrics%20%3A%20basic%20science%2C%20clinical%20application&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEM is often associated with micronutrient deficiency.&lt;ref name="Nutrition in pediatrics" /&gt; Two forms of PEM are [[kwashiorkor]] and [[marasmus]], and they commonly coexist.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt;

==== Kwashiorkor ====
[[Kwashiorkor]] is mainly caused by inadequate protein intake.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; The main symptoms are [[edema]], wasting, liver enlargement, hypoalbuminaemia, steatosis, and possibly depigmentation of skin and hair.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Kwashiorkor is further identified by swelling of the belly, which is deceiving of actual nutritional status.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt; The term means ‘displaced child’ and is derived from a Ghana language of West Africa, means "the sickness the older one gets when the next baby is born," as this is when the older child is deprived of breast feeding and weaned to a diet composed largely of carbohydrates.&lt;ref name="listeningga"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Listening to the Ga: Cicely Williams' Discovery of Kwashiorkor on the Gold Coast|author=Stanton J|year=2001|journal=Clio Medica: Studies in the History of Medicine and Health|volume=61|pages=149–71|pmid=11603151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marasmus====
[[Marasmus]] (‘to waste away’) is caused by an inadequate intake of protein and energy. The main symptoms are severe wasting, leaving little or no edema, minimal subcutaneous fat, severe muscle wasting, and non-normal serum albumin levels.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Marasmus can result from a sustained diet of inadequate energy and protein, and the metabolism adapts to prolong survival.&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; It is traditionally seen in famine, significant food restriction, or more severe cases of [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]].&lt;ref name="Clinical Nutrition in Practice (2011)" /&gt; Conditions are characterized by extreme wasting of the muscles and a gaunt expression.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2008" /&gt;

===Undernutrition, hunger===
Undernutrition encompasses [[stunted growth]] (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients). The term [[hunger]], which describes a feeling of discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to food insecurity.&lt;ref name="Black2008" /&gt;

===Definition by Gomez===
In 1956, Gómez and Galvan studied factors associated with death in a group of malnourished (undernourished) children in a hospital in Mexico City, Mexico and defined categories of malnutrition: first, second, and third degree.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. D.|author2=Conaway, M. R.|title=Weight and Mortality Rates: "Gomez Classification" for Children With Cerebral Palsy?|journal=Pediatrics|date=August 2011|volume=128|issue=2|pages=e436–e437|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1472|pmid=21768321}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degrees were based on weight below a specified percentage of median weight for age.&lt;ref name="Grover 2009" /&gt; The risk of death increases with increasing degree of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Stevenson 2011" /&gt; An adaptation of Gomez's original classification is still used today. While it provides a way to compare malnutrition within and between populations, the classification has been criticized for being "arbitrary" and for not considering overweight as a form of malnutrition. Also, height alone may not be the best indicator of malnutrition; children who are born prematurely may be considered short for their age even if they have good nutrition.&lt;ref name="Gueri 1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gueri |first1=M.|author2=J. M. Gurney, P. Jutsum|title=The gomez classification.

===Definition by Waterlow===
[[John Waterlow|John Conrad Waterlow]] established a new classification for malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt; Instead of using just weight for age measurements, the classification established by Waterlow combines weight-for-height (indicating acute episodes of malnutrition) with height-for-age to show the stunting that results from chronic malnutrition.&lt;ref name="J. C. Waterlow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watts|first=Geoff|title=John Conrad Waterlow|journal=The Lancet|date=December 2010|volume=376|issue=9757|pages=1982|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(10)62252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage of the Waterlow classification over the Gomez classification is that weight for height can be examined even if ages are not known.&lt;ref name="Waterlow 1972"/&gt;

Lower energy and impaired function of the brain also represent the downward spiral of malnutrition as victims are less able to perform the tasks they need to in order to acquire food, earn an income, or gain an education.

[[Avitaminosis|Vitamin-deficiency-related diseases]] (such as [[scurvy]] and [[rickets]]).

Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can result from a child not eating for 4 to 6 hours. Hypoglycemia should be considered if there is lethargy, limpness, convulsion, or loss of consciousness. If blood sugar can be measured immediately and quickly, perform a finger or heel stick.

[[File:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]], 1865]]
Major causes of malnutrition include poverty and food prices, dietary practices and agricultural productivity, with many individual cases being a mixture of several factors.  [[Clinical malnutrition]], such as [[cachexia]], is a major burden also in [[Developed country|developed countries]]. Various scales of analysis also have to be considered in order to determine the sociopolitical causes of malnutrition. For example, the population of a community that is within poor governments, may be at risk if the area lacks health-related services, but on a smaller scale certain households or individuals may be at an even higher risk due to differences in income levels, access to land, or levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fotso | first1 = J.

===Dietary practices===

==== Undernutrition ====
A lack of adequate breastfeeding leads to malnutrition in infants and children, associated with the deaths of an estimated one million children annually. Illegal advertising of breast milk substitutes contributed to malnutrition and continued three decades after its 1981 prohibition under the ''WHO International Code of Marketing Breast Milk Substitutes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Arch Dis Child |date=June 2012 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=529–32 |title=Marketing breast milk substitutes: problems and perils throughout the world |author=Brady JP |pmid=22419779 |pmc=3371222 |doi=10.1136/archdischild-2011-301299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maternal malnutrition can also factor into the poor health or death of a baby. Over 800,000 [[neonatal death]] have occurred because of deficient growth of the fetus in the mother's womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/261533.php|title=Malnutrition Kills Over 3 Million Children Annually Worldwide|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deriving too much of one's diet from a single source, such as eating almost exclusively corn or rice, can cause malnutrition. This may either be from a lack of education about proper nutrition, or from only having access to a single food source.&lt;ref name=Burchi&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Environ Res Public Health |date=February 2011 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=358–73 |title=The role of food and nutrition system approaches in tackling hidden hunger |vauthors=Burchi F, Fanzo J, Frison E |pmid=21556191 |pmc=3084466 |doi=10.3390/ijerph8020358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not just the total amount of calories that matters but specific nutritional deficiencies such as [[vitamin A deficiency]], [[iron deficiency]] or [[zinc deficiency]] can also increase risk of death.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;UNICEF (2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/2148 Improving Child Nutrition - The achievable imperative for global progress]. UNICEF&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Overnutrition ====
Overnutrition caused by [[overeating]] is also a form of malnutrition. In the United States, more than half of all adults are now overweight — a condition that, like hunger, increases susceptibility to disease and disability, reduces worker productivity, and lowers life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is much more common in the United States, where for the majority of people, access to food is not an issue. Many parts of the world have access to a surplus of non-nutritious food, in addition to increased sedentary lifestyles. Yale psychologist Kelly Brownell calls this a "[[toxic food environment]]" where fat and sugar laden foods have taken precedence over healthy nutritious foods.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

The issue in these developed countries is choosing the right kind of food. More fast food is consumed per capita in the United States than in any other country. The reason for this mass consumption of fast food is its affordability and accessibility. Often fast food, low in cost and nutrition, is high in calories and heavily promoted. When these eating habits are combined with increasingly urbanized, automated, and more sedentary lifestyles, it becomes clear why weight gain is difficult to avoid.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Gary|last2=Halweil|first2=Brian|year=2000|title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488|journal=World Watch|volume=13|issue=4|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only does obesity occur in developed countries, problems are also occurring in developing countries in areas where income is on the rise.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt; Overeating is also a problem in countries where hunger and poverty persist. In China, consumption of high-fat foods has increased while consumption of rice and other goods has decreased.&lt;ref name="Gardner00" /&gt;

Overeating leads to many diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, that may result in death.

===Poverty and food prices===

In Bangladesh, poor socioeconomic position was associated with chronic malnutrition since it inhibits purchase of nutritious foods such as milk, meat, poultry, and fruits.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Khan |first1=MM|author2=Kraemer, A|title=Factors associated with being underweight, overweight and obese among ever-married non-pregnant urban women in Bangladesh|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|date=August 2009|volume=50|issue=8|pages=804–13|pmid=19710981}}&lt;/ref&gt; As much as food shortages may be a contributing factor to malnutrition in countries with lack of technology, the [[FAO]] (Food and Agriculture Organization) has estimated that eighty percent of malnourished children living in the developing world live in countries that produce food surpluses.&lt;ref name=Gardner00&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gardner |first1=Gary |last2=Halweil |first2=Brian |title=Escaping Hunger, Escaping Excess |journal=World Watch |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=24 |year=2000 |url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/488}}&lt;/ref&gt; The economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that, in recent decades, famine has always been a problem of food distribution and/or poverty, as there has been sufficient food to feed the whole population of the world. He states that malnutrition and [[famine]] were more related to problems of food distribution and purchasing power.&lt;ref name=Sen81&gt;{{cite book |first=Amartya Kumar |last=Sen |title=Poverty and famines: An essay on entitlement and deprivation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BzU_AwAAQBAJ |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-828463-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that commodity speculators are increasing the cost of food. As the real estate bubble in the United States was collapsing, it is said that trillions of dollars moved to invest in food and primary commodities, causing the 2007–2008 [[food price crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The role of speculators in the global food crisis |agency= |work= |newspaper=Spiegel Online |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,549187,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[biofuel]]s as a replacement for traditional fuels raises the price of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuel use increasing poverty |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= June 25, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7472532.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] special rapporteur on the right to food, [[Jean Ziegler]] proposes that agricultural waste, such as corn cobs and banana leaves, rather than crops themselves be used as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Biofuels 'crime against humanity' |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= October 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7065061.stm |first=Grant |last=Ferrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural productivity===
Local food shortages can be caused by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as [[crop rotation]], or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern [[agriculture]], such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[free market]] policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zambia: fertile but hungry |agency= |work= |newspaper=BBC News |date= February 6, 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm |first=Peter |last=Biles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;
Reasons for the unavailability of fertilizer include moves to stop supplying fertilizer on [[environmental movement|environmental]] grounds, cited as the obstacle to feeding Africa by the [[Green Revolution]] pioneers [[Norman Borlaug]] and Keith Rosenberg.&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |title=Forgotten benefactor of humanity |agency= |work= |newspaper=The Atlantic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future threats===
There are a number of potential disruptions to global food supply that could cause widespread malnutrition.

[[Global warming]] is of importance to food security, with 95 percent of all malnourished peoples living in the relatively stable climate region of the sub-tropics and tropics. According to the latest [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] reports, temperature increases in these regions are "very likely."&lt;ref name=ipcc&gt;{{cite web |title= Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report |date=November 12–17, 2007 |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf |accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even small changes in temperatures can lead to increased frequency of extreme weather conditions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt; Many of these have great impact on agricultural production and hence nutrition. For example, the 1998–2001 central Asian drought brought about an 80 percent livestock loss and 50 percent reduction in wheat and barley crops in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Battisti, David S. "Climate Change in Developing Countries." University of Washington. Seattle. October 27, 2008.{{vn|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar figures were present in other nations. An increase in extreme weather such as drought in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa would have even greater consequences in terms of malnutrition. Even without an increase of extreme weather events, a simple increase in temperature reduces the productivity of many crop species, also decreasing food security in these regions.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Black, Richard |title=Rice yields falling under global warming |agency= |newspaper=BBC News; Science &amp; Environment |date=August 9, 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-10918591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colony collapse disorder]] is a phenomenon where bees die in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aginfo.psu.edu/news/2007/1/HoneyBees.htm Honey Bee Die-Off Alarms Beekeepers, Crop growers and researchers]&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[list of crop plants pollinated by bees|many agricultural crops worldwide are pollinated by bees]], this represents a threat to the supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanishing bees threaten US crops |newspaper=BBC News |date= March 11, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6438373.stm |first=Matt |last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food security===

{{Main|Food security}}
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the West, such as nitrogen fertilizers and pesticides, to Asia, called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in increased [[food production]] and corresponding decreases in prices and malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing infrastructure and institutions that are in short supply in Africa, such as a system of roads or public seed companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=In Africa, prosperity from seeds falls short |agency= |work= |newspaper=New York Times |date= October 10, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin |first=Celia W. |last=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in agriculture, such as subsidized fertilizers and seeds, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Barclay, Eliza |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |agency= |work= |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |date=June 18, 2008 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the case of Malawi, almost five million of its 13 million people used to need emergency food aid. However, after the government changed policy and subsidies for fertilizer and seed were introduced against World Bank strictures, farmers produced record-breaking corn harvests as production leaped to 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005, making Malawi a major food exporter.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; This lowered food prices and increased wages for farm workers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt; Such investments in agriculture are still needed in other African countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The country has one of the highest  prevalence of malnutrition even though it is blessed with great agricultural potential John Ulimwengu explains in his article for D+C.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |author=John Ulimwengu|title=Need in a land of planty |publisher= dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/spite-drcs-huge-agricultural-potential-many-people-lack-vital-nutrients|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents for investing in agriculture include [[Jeffrey Sachs]], who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa’s farmers.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama&gt;{{cite news |title=Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion |agency= |work= The New York Times|newspaper= |date=July 9, 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Celia W. |last2=Dugger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria, the use of imported Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) has been used to treat malnutrition in the North. ''Soy Kunu'', a locally sourced and prepared blend consisting of peanut, millet and soya beans may also be used.&lt;ref name=Soykunu&gt;{{cite news |title=Severe Malnutrition, A Disturbance in Nigerian Health Sector |agency= |work= Public Health Nigeria|newspaper= |date=October 12, 2018 |url=https://publichealthng.com/severe-malnutrition-a-disturbance-in-nigerian-health-sector/ |first1=Obasi |last1=Chinedu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technology in agricultural production also has great potential to combat undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Jiming, Yeyun Xin and Longping Yuan. (2010). Pushing the Yield Frontier: Hybrid rice in China. In MillionsFed: Proved Success in Agriculture Development. Washington, DC: International Policy Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt; By improving agricultural yields, farmers could reduce poverty by increasing income as well as open up area for diversification of crops for household use. The World Bank itself claims to be part of the solution to malnutrition, asserting that the best way for countries to succeed in breaking the cycle of poverty and malnutrition is to build export-led economies that will give them the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market.

===Economics===
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name="csmonitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html|title=UN aid debate: give cash not food?|date=June 4, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's [[World Food Program]], the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|title=Cash roll-out to help hunger hot spots|date=December 8, 2008|publisher=World Food Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899|archivedate=February 12, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a mobile phone operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt;

However, for people in a drought living a long way from and with limited access to markets, delivering food may be the most appropriate way to help.&lt;ref name="csmonitor" /&gt; [[Fred Cuny]] stated that "the chances of saving lives at the outset of a relief operation are greatly reduced when food is imported. By the time it arrives in the country and gets to people, many will have died."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Natsios (Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. law, which requires buying food at home rather than where the hungry live, is inefficient because approximately half of what is spent goes for transport.&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients" /&gt; Cuny further pointed out "studies of every recent famine have shown that food was available in-country — though not always in the immediate food deficit area" and "even though by local standards the prices are too high for the poor to purchase it, it would usually be cheaper for a donor to buy the hoarded food at the inflated price than to import it from abroad."&lt;ref&gt;Memorandum to former Representative Steve Solarz (United States, Democratic Party, New York), July 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]
[[Food bank]]s and [[soup kitchen]]s address malnutrition in places where people lack money to buy food.  A [[basic income]] has been proposed as a way to ensure that everyone has enough money to buy food and other basic needs; it is a form of [[social security]] in which all citizens or residents of a country regularly receive an unconditional sum of money, either from a government or some other public institution, in addition to any income received from elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.canadiansocialresearch.net/ssrgai.htm |title = Improving Social Security in Canada Guaranteed Annual Income: A Supplementary Paper |publisher = Government of Canada |year = 1994 |accessdate = 30 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed method for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2|title=A model of African food aid is now in trouble|date=May 6, 2008|work=|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopia been pioneering a program, and Brazil has established a recycling program for organic waste that benefits farmers, urban poor, and the city in general. City residents separate organic waste from their garbage, bag it, and then exchange it for fresh fruit and vegetables from local farmers. As a result, the country's waste is reduced and the urban poor get a steady supply of nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Gardner00_5" /&gt;

===World population===

Restricting population size is a proposed solution. [[Thomas Malthus]] argued that population growth could be controlled by natural disasters and voluntary limits through "moral restraint."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Thomas Robert |last1=Malthus |authorlink=Thomas Malthus |first2=Philip |last2= Appleman |title=An essay on the principle of population: text, sources and background, criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raGGQgAACAAJ |year=1976 |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-09202-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Chapman suggests that an intervention through government policies is a necessary ingredient of curtailing global population growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chapman | first1 = R. | title = No room at the inn, or why population problems are not all economic | journal = Population and Environment | volume = 21 | pages = 81–97 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/BF02436122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The interdependence and complementarity of population growth with poverty and malnutrition (as well as the environment) is also recognised by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/environment/index.shtml|title=Environment - United Nations Population Division {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200 million women worldwide do not have adequate access to family planning services. According to the World Health Organisation, "Family planning is key to slowing unsustainable population growth and the resulting negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/family-planning-contraception|title=Family planning/Contraception|website=World Health Organization|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are many who believe that the world has more than enough resources to sustain its population. Instead, these theorists point to unequal distribution of resources and under- or unutilized arable land as the cause for malnutrition problems.&lt;ref&gt;Ohlin, G. (1967). Population control and economic development. Paris: Dev Centers, OECD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nielson, K. (1992). Global Justice, Capitalism and the Third World. (R. A. Wilkons, Ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Amartya Sen advocates that, "no matter how a famine is caused, methods of breaking it call for a large supply of food in the [[Public Distribution System|public distribution system]]. This applies not only to organizing rationing and control, but also to undertaking work programmes and other methods of increasing purchasing power for those hit by shifts in exchange entitlements in a general inflationary situation."&lt;ref name="Sen81" /&gt; 

===Food sovereignty===

{{Main|Food sovereignty}}
One suggested policy framework to resolve access issues is termed [[food sovereignty]]—the right of peoples to define their own food, agriculture, livestock, and fisheries systems, in contrast to having food largely subjected to international market forces. Food First is one of the primary think tanks working to build support for food sovereignty. Neoliberals advocate for an increasing role of the free market.

===Health facilities===

Another possible long term solution would be to increase access to health facilities to rural parts of the world. These facilities could monitor undernourished children, act as supplemental food distribution centers, and provide education on dietary needs. These types of facilities have already proven very successful in countries such as Peru and Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = H. R. | last2 = Penny | first2 = M.

===Breastfeeding===

As of 2016 is estimated that about 821,000 deaths of children less than five years old could be prevented globally per year through more widespread breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Lancet2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Victora|first1=CG|last2=Bahl|first2=R|last3=Barros|first3=AJ|last4=França|first4=GV|last5=Horton|first5=S|last6=Krasevec|first6=J|last7=Murch|first7=S|last8=Sankar|first8=MJ|last9=Walker|first9=N|date=January 30, 2016|title=Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect.|journal=Lancet|volume=387|issue=10017|pages=475–90|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)01024-7|pmid=26869575|last10=Rollins|first10=NC|last11=Lancet Breastfeeding Series|first11=Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to reducing infant death, breast milk feeding provides an important source of micronutrients, clinically proven to bolster the immune system of children, and provide long-term defenses against non-communicable and allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessen|first=Rachelle|last2=Kavanagh|first2=Katherine|date=2015-03-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Promoting and Supporting Breastfeeding|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(14)01876-0/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=115|issue=3|pages=444–449|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2014.12.014|pmid=25721389|issn=2212-2672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breastfeeding has also been shown to improve cognitive abilities in children, with a strong correlation to individual educational achievements.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi Omobolanle|last2=Dagvadorj|first2=Amarjagal|last3=Anigo|first3=Kola Mathew|last4=Ota|first4=Erika|last5=Sasaki|first5=Satoshi|date=2015-10-01|title=Factors influencing breastfeeding exclusivity during the first 6 months of life in developing countries: a quantitative and qualitative systematic review|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|language=en|volume=11|issue=4|pages=433–451|doi=10.1111/mcn.12180|pmid=25857205|issn=1740-8709}}&lt;/ref&gt; As previously noted, lack of proper breastfeeding is a major factor in child mortality rates, and a primary determinant of disease development for children.

==== Barriers to breastfeeding ====

Breastfeeding is noted as one of the most cost effective medical interventions for providing beneficial child health.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; While there are considerable differences within developed and developing countries: income, employment, social norms, and access to healthcare were found to be universal determinants of whether a mother breast or formula fed their children.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  Community based healthcare workers have helped alleviate financial barriers faced by newly made mothers, and provided a viable alternative to traditional and expensive hospital based medical care.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; Recent studies based upon surveys conducted from 1995-2010 shows exclusive breastfeeding rates have gone up globally, from 33% to 39%.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Despite the growth rates, medical professionals acknowledge the need for improvement given the importance of exclusive breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===Global initiatives===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

Food security and global malnutrition has long been a topic of international concern, with one of the first official global documents addressing it being the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]](UDHR). Within this document it stated that access to food was part of an adequate right to a standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|date=2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Right to food]] was asserted in the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], a [[treaty]] adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on December 16, 1966. The Right to food is a [[human rights|human right]] for people to feed themselves in dignity, be free from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.righttofood.org/work-of-jean-ziegler-at-the-un/what-is-the-right-to-food/|title=What is the Right to Food? {{!}} Right to food|website=www.righttofood.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the treaty has been signed by 166 countries, by signing states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve the right to adequate food.

However, after the 1966 International Covenant the global concern for the access to sufficient food only became more present, leading to the first ever World Food Conference that was held in 1974 in Rome, Italy. The [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] was a UN resolution adopted November 16, 1974 by all 135 countries that attended the 1974 World Food Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/publications/universal-declaration-on-the-eradication-of-hunger-and-malnutrition.htm|title=Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-legally binding document set forth certain aspirations for countries to follow to sufficiently take action on the global food problem. Ultimately this document outline and provided guidance as to how the international community as one could work towards fighting and solving the growing global issue of malnutrition and hunger.

Adoption of the right to food was included in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]], this 1978 document was adopted by many countries in the Americas, the purpose of the document is, "to consolidate in this hemisphere, within the framework of democratic institutions, a system of personal liberty and [[social justice]] based on respect for the essential rights of man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrcr.org/docs/American_Convention/oashr.html|title=American Convention on Human Rights|website=www.hrcr.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next document in the timeline of global inititaves for malnutrition was the 1996 [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]], organized by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]. This document reaffirmed the right to have access to safe and nutritous food by everyone, also considering that everyone gets sufficient food, and set the goals for all nations to improve their commitment to food security by halfing their amount of undernourished people by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|title=Rome Declaration and Plan of Action|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the Food and Agriculture Organization adopted the  [[Right to Food Guidelines]], which offered states a framework of how to increase the right to food on a national basis.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx Outcome of the 2012 Copenhagen Consensus]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], approved through the UN in 2015. In particular Goal 2: Zero hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/ Description and targets for Goal 2 of the Sustainable Development Goals]&lt;/ref&gt; The partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition. 2015.

In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children. The program will initiatilly be implemented in Bangladesh, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Laos and Niger and will help these countries to improve information and analysis about nutrition so they can develop effective national nutrition policies.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission Press release.

Accessed on 1 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the right to food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.

In response to child malnutrition, the [[Bangladesh|Bangladeshi government]] recommends ten steps for treating severe malnutrition. They are to prevent or treat [[dehydration]], [[hypoglycemia|low blood sugar]], [[hypothermia|low body temperature]], infection, correct electrolyte imbalances and micronutrient deficiencies, start feeding cautiously, achieve catch-up growth, provide psychological support, and prepare for discharge and follow-up after recovery.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

Among those who are hospitalized, nutritional support improves protein, calorie intake and weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bally|first1=MR|last2=Blaser Yildirim|first2=PZ|last3=Bounoure|first3=L|last4=Gloy|first4=VL|last5=Mueller|first5=B|last6=Briel|first6=M|last7=Schuetz|first7=P|date=January 1, 2016|title=Nutritional Support and Outcomes in Malnourished Medical Inpatients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=1|pages=43–53|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.6587|pmid=26720894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
The evidence for benefit of supplementary feeding is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sguassero|first1=Y|last2=de Onis|first2=M|last3=Bonotti|first3=AM|last4=Carroli|first4=G|date=Jun 13, 2012|title=Community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the growth of children under five years of age in low and middle income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD005039|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3|pmid=22696347}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the small amount of research done on this treatment.

Specially formulated foods do however appear useful in those from the developing world with moderate acute malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Lazzer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lazzerini|first1=M|last2=Rubert|first2=L|last3=Pani|first3=P|date=Jun 21, 2013|title=Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009584|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2|pmid=23794237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In young children with severe acute malnutrition it is unclear if [[ready-to-use therapeutic food]] differs from a normal diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonees|first1=A|last2=Lombard|first2=M|last3=Musekiwa|first3=A|last4=Nel|first4=E|last5=Volmink|first5=J|date=Jun 6, 2013|title=Ready-to-use therapeutic food for home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children from six months to five years of age.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD009000|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2|pmid=23744450}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may have some benefits in humanitarian emergencies as they can be eaten directly from the packet, do not require refrigeration or mixing with clean water, and can be stored for years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8114750.stm|title=Firms target nutrition for the poor|last=Anderson|first=Tatum|date=June 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=BBC News|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those who are severely malnourished, feeding too much too quickly can result in [[refeeding syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Via2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Viana Lde|first1=A|last2=Burgos|first2=MG|last3=Silva Rde|first3=A|date=Jan–Mar 2012|title=Refeeding syndrome: clinical and nutritional relevance.|journal=Arquivos Brasileiros de Cirurgia Digestiva : ABCD = Brazilian Archives of Digestive Surgery|volume=25|issue=1|pages=56–9|pmid=22569981}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result regardless of route of feeding and can present itself a couple of days after eating with [[heart failure]], [[Cardiac dysrhythmia|dysrhythmia]]s and confusion that can result in death.&lt;ref name="Via2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boateng|first1=AA|last2=Sriram|first2=K|last3=Meguid|first3=MM|last4=Crook|first4=M|date=Feb 2010|title=Refeeding syndrome: treatment considerations based on collective analysis of literature case reports.|journal=Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)|volume=26|issue=2|pages=156–67|doi=10.1016/j.nut.2009.11.017|pmid=20122539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manufacturers are trying to fortify everyday foods with micronutrients that can be sold to consumers such as wheat flour for Beladi bread in Egypt or fish sauce in Vietnam and the iodization of salt.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;

For example, flour has been fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and other B vitamins such as thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B12.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Micronutrients===
Treating malnutrition, mostly through [[food fortification|fortifying]] foods with micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), improves lives at a lower cost and shorter time than other forms of [[aid]], according to the World Bank.&lt;ref name="IQ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/04/opinion/04kristof.html|title=Raising the world's IQ|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=December 4, 2008|work=The New York Times|newspaper=|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which look at a variety of development proposals, ranked micronutrient supplements as number one.&lt;ref name="hiddenhunger"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/opinion/24kristof.html|title=The Hidden Hunger|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|date=May 24, 2009|work=|newspaper=New York Times|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Let them eat micronutrients"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/160075|title=Let them eat micronutrients|work=|newspaper=Newsweek|agency=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In those with diarrhea, once an initial four-hour rehydration period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc increases the chances of reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur in the next two to three months.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)"&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], World Health Organization, 2005.  See especially Ch. 4 "Management of Acute Diarrhoea (Without Blood)" and Ch. 8 "Management of Diarrhoea With Severe Malnutrition."&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, malnourished children need both potassium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008"&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh], Institute of Public Health Nutrition, Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, May 2008, page 18 (19 in PDF) and following pages.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be obtained by following the above recommendations for the dehydrated child to continue eating within two to three hours of starting rehydration,&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; and including foods rich in potassium as above. [[Hypokalemia|Low blood potassium]] is worsened when base (as in Ringer's/Hartmann's) is given to treat acidosis without simultaneously providing potassium.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; As above, available home products such as salted and unsalted cereal water, salted and unsalted vegetable broth can be given early during the course of a child's diarrhea along with continued eating.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;  Vitamin A, potassium, magnesium, and zinc should be added with other vitamins and minerals if available.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

For a malnourished child with diarrhea from any cause, this should include foods rich in potassium such as bananas, green coconut water, and unsweetened fresh fruit juice.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;

===Diarrhea===
[[File:ORT saches.JPG|thumb|Examples of commercially available oral rehydration salts (Nepal on left, Peru on right).]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rehydrating a severely undernourished child who has diarrhea relatively slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called [[oral rehydration solution]] (ORS).&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; The oral rehydration solution is both slightly [[sweet]] and slightly [[salt]]y and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; Fluids by [[nasogastric tube]] may be use in those who do not drink.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; [[Intravenous]] fluids are recommended only in those who have [[Shock (circulatory)|significant dehydration]] due to their potential complications.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp8/&gt; --&gt; These complications include [[congestive heart failure]].&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Over time, ORS developed into [[Oral rehydration therapy|ORT]], or [[oral rehydration therapy]], which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Victora|first=Cesar|last2=Bryce|first2=Jennifer|date=Jan 2000|title=Reducing deaths from diarrhoea through oral rehydration therapy|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?pid=S0042-96862000001000010&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=e|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1246–1255|doi=10.1590/S0042-96862000001000010|pmid=|access-date=|doi-broken-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast feeding and eating should resume as soon as possible.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt; Drinks such as soft drinks, fruit juices, or sweetened teas are not recommended as they contain too much sugar and may worsen diarrhea.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf|title=The Treatment of diarrhoea : a manual for physicians and other senior health  workers.|date=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=924159318 0|edition=4|location=Geneva|pages=8–16|chapter=4. Management of acute diarrhoea without blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Broad spectrum antibiotic]]s are recommended in all severely undernourished children with diarrhea requiring admission to hospital.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

To prevent dehydration readily available fluids, preferably with a modest amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Once dehydration develops oral rehydration solutions are preferred.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless there are signs of swelling.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2005Chp4/&gt; --&gt; Vomiting rarely prevents rehydration as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp4" /&gt; A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.&lt;ref name="WHO2005Chp8" /&gt;

For babies a dropper or syringe without the needle can be used to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for children under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt; After the first two hours, rehydration should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of rehydration it is recommended that to alternate between rehydration and food.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

In 2003, WHO and UNICEF recommended a reduced-[[osmolarity]] ORS which still treats dehydration but also reduced stool volume and vomiting. Reduced-osmolarity ORS is the current standard ORS with reasonably wide availability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4950e/2.4.html WHO Drug Information Vol. 16, No. 2, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rehydrate.org/ors/low-osmolarity-ors.htm Low-osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS)], Rehydrate Project, updated: April 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; For general use, one packet of ORS (glucose sugar, salt, potassium chloride, and trisodium citrate) is added to one liter of water; however, for malnourished children it is recommended that one packet of ORS be added to two liters of water along with an extra 50 grams of sucrose sugar and some stock potassium solution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241593180.pdf The Treatment of Diarrhoea: A manual for physicians and other senior health workers], WHO, 2005.  Specifically, 45 milliliters of potassium chloride solution from a stock solution containing 100g KCl per liter, along with one packet of ORS, ''&lt;u&gt;two&lt;/u&gt;'' liters of water, and 50 grams of sucrose.  And please remember, sucrose has approximately twice the molecular weight of glucose, with one mole of glucose weighing 180 g and one mole of sucrose weighing 342 g.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malnourished children have an excess of body sodium.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;  Recommendations for home remedies agree with one liter of water (34 oz.) and 6 teaspoons sugar and disagree regarding whether it is then one teaspoon of salt added or only 1/2, with perhaps most sources recommending 1/2 teaspoon of added salt to one liter water.&lt;ref name="WHO (2005)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2005/9241592330.pdf "Guidelines for the control of shigellosis, including epidemics due to Shigella dysenteriae type 1".] World Health Organization, 2005, Annex 12 - Preparation of Home Made Oral Rehydration Solution, page 51 (57 in PDF): "Ingredients: Half a teaspoon of salt (2.5 grams), six level teaspoons of sugar (30 grams) and one litre of safe drinking water".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dehydration/basics/treatment/con-20030056 "Dehydration, treatments and drugs."] Mayo Clinic January 7, 2011.

===Low blood sugar===
[[Hypoglycemia]], whether known or suspected, can be treated with a mixture of sugar and water. If the child is conscious, the initial dose of sugar and water can be given by mouth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/SAM_Guideline.pdf National Guidelines for the Management of Severely Malnourished Children in Bangladesh] recommends, for initial hypoglycemia, a 50 milliliter bolus of 10% glucose or sucrose.  This can also be achieved by added 1 rounded teaspoon of sugar to 10.5 teaspoons of water (which is 3.5 tablespoons of water).&lt;/ref&gt; If the child is unconscious, give glucose by [[intravenous]] or [[nasogastric tube]]. If seizures occur after despite glucose, rectal [[diazepam]] is recommended. Blood sugar levels should be re-checked on two hour intervals.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

===Hypothermia===
[[Hypothermia]] can occur. To prevent or treat this, the child can be kept warm with covering including of the head or by direct skin-to-skin contact with the mother or father and then covering both parent and child. Prolonged bathing or prolonged medical exams should be avoided. Warming methods are usually most important at night.&lt;ref name="Bangladeshi-Ministry-of-Health-and-Family-Welfare-2008" /&gt;

The figures provided in this section on epidemiology all refer to ''undernutrition'' even if the term malnutrition is used which, by definition, could also apply to too much nutrition.

The [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of countries’ hunger situation. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8306556.stm |title= Global hunger worsening, warns UN |publisher= BBC (Europe) |date= 14 October 2009 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GHI is updated once a year. The data from the 2015 report shows that Hunger levels have dropped 27% since 2000. Fifty two countries remain at serious or alarming levels. In addition to the latest statistics on Hunger and Food Security, the GHI also features different special topics each year. The 2015 report include an article on conflict and food security.&lt;ref&gt;K. von Grebmer, J. Bernstein, A. de Waal, N. Prasai, S. Yin, Y.

==History ==
Throughout history, portions of the world's population have often experienced sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, this resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. For the first few decades after [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2000 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's people. According to the WFP some statistics are that, "Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished."&lt;ref name="wfp.org Hunger Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Statistics|url=https://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|website=World Food Programme|publisher=wfp.org|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2006, the average international price of food had been largely stable for several decades. In the closing months of 2006, however, prices began to [[2007–2008 world food price crisis|rise rapidly]]. By 2008, rice had tripled in price in some regions, and this severely affected [[developing countries]]. Food prices fell in early 2009, but rose to another record high in 2011, and have since decreased slightly. The [[financial crisis of 2007–2012|2008 worldwide financial crisis]] further increased the number of people suffering from hunger, including dramatic increases even in advanced economies such as [[Great Britain]], the [[Eurozone]] and the [[United States]].

The [[Millennium Development Goals]] included a commitment to a further 50% reduction in the proportion of the world's population who have extreme hunger by 2015. As of 2012, this target appeared difficult to achieve, due in part to persistent inflation in food prices. However, in late 2012 the UN's [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) stated it is still possible to hit the target with sufficient effort. In 2013, the ''FAO'' estimated that 842 million people are undernourished (12% of the global population). Malnutrition is a cause of death for more than 3.1 million children under 5 every year. [[UNICEF]] estimates 300 million children go to bed hungry each night; and that 8000 children under the age of 5 are estimated to die of malnutrition every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/364_617.htm|author=Ernest C. Madu|title=Investment and Development Will Secure the Rights of the Child}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century and earlier===
Throughout history, the need to aid those suffering from hunger has been commonly, though not universally,&lt;ref&gt;As an example of historical opposition to food aid, during the [[Hungry Forties]], English [[Laissez-faire]] advocates were largely successful in preventing it being deployed by Great Britain to relief the Irish famine; see for example the section on "Ideology and relief"' in Chpt. 2 of ''The Great Irish Famine'' by [[Cormac Ó Gráda]].

For a detailed description of how views opposed to hunger relief became dominant within Great Britain's policy making circles during the 19th century, and also their subsequent displacement, see ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007) by James Vernon, esp. Chpts. 1–3. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp programme, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals. ( See [http://www.star-telegram.com/2012/07/14/4099922/food-stamp-debate-brings-out-the.html Food stamp debate brings out the haters] published by the ''Star Telegram''. )&lt;/ref&gt; recognized.

The philosopher [[Simone Weil]] wrote that feeding the hungry when you have resources to do so is the most obvious of all human [[Moral obligation|obligations]]. She says that as far back as [[Ancient Egypt]], many believed that people had to show they had helped the hungry in order to justify themselves in the afterlife. Weil writes that [[Social progress]] is commonly held to be first of all, "...a transition to a state of human society in which people will not suffer from hunger." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Simone Weil]]|title=The Need for Roots|page = 6|year=2002 |orig-year= 1942|isbn=978-0-415-27102-8|publisher = [[Routledge]]|title-link=The Need for Roots}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social historian [[Karl Polanyi]] wrote that before markets became the world's dominant form of economic organization in the 19th century, most human societies would either starve all together or not at all, because communities would invariably share their food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = [[Karl Polanyi]] | title = The Great Transformation | year = 2002 |orig-year=1942 | chapter = chpt. 4  | isbn = 978-0-8070-5643-1  | publisher=Beacon Press | title-link = The Great Transformation (book) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for people to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.&lt;ref&gt;For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007), James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists, with some academics and politicians also calling for or organizing intervention against world hunger, such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"&gt;{{cite book |author = James Vernon|title=Hunger: A Modern History |chapter = Chpts. 1-3|year= 2007|isbn=978-0674026780 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"&gt;{{cite journal|author = David Grigg|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945–1980|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers|year= 1981

===Great Depression===
[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|210px|Unemployed men outside a soup kitchen in Chicago, 1931|upright=1.15]]
Hunger as an academic and social topic came to prominence during the [[Great Depression]]. As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called "the paradox of want amid plenty," agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Janet Poppendieck | title = Eating Agendas | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0 | publisher=Aldine Transaction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After World War II===
[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Martin Luther King]] (center), one of many twentieth century political figures who considered it important to fight hunger: "When I die, don't build a monument to me. Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry." &lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;]]
After World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]].

For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"&gt;{{cite book |author = John R. Butterly and Jack Shepherd |title=Hunger: The Biology and Politics of Starvation|year= 2010|isbn=978-1584659266 |publisher= Dartmouth College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly established United Nations became a leading player in co-ordinating the global fight against hunger. The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas.

WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

Following successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;

The United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism. Despite this view, during the 1960s postwar era hunger within the United States was overshadowed by hunger in Europe and Asia. John F. Kennedy did in fact use Executive Order to double the amount of commodities available from the surplus commodity program as well as initiated the pilot Food Stamp Program which later became permanent in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurer|first1=Donna|last2=Poppendieck|first2=Janet|title=Eating agendas : food and nutrition as social problems|date=1995|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=9780202305073|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"/&gt;
[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]
Organizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the "[[free trade]]" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond|publisher= [[World Bank]]|date=30 March 2012|accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigg"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "foodAndFamine"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Politics of hunger"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until at least the 1980s—and, to an extent, the 1990s—the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MR-2013-11-Magdoff"&gt;[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRzine-2012-12-Goswami"&gt;Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04&lt;/ref&gt;  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.&lt;ref name="foodAndFamine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens |author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans|title=The Globalization of World Politics|chapter = "Poverty, development and hunger"|year= 2010|isbn=978-0199569090 |publisher= [[Oxford University press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

In 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a ''global food crisis'', increasing the numbers suffering from hunger by over a hundred million. [[Food riot]]s erupted in several dozen countries; in at least two cases, [[Haiti]] and [[Madagascar]], this led to the toppling of governments. A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief. However, several analysts argue the food crisis was one of the causes of the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref name="Politics of hunger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="G202012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"&gt;{{cite news|

As of 2008 roughly $300 million of aid went to basic nutrition each year, less than $2 for each child below two in the 20 worst affected countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In contrast, at that time [[AIDS|HIV/AIDS]], which caused fewer deaths than child malnutrition, received $2.2 billion—$67 per person with HIV in all countries.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt; In 2008 UN estimated that ending world hunger could cost about 30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/news/04iht-04food.13446176.html|title=UN says solving food crisis could cost $30 billion|first=Elisabeth Rosenthal and Andrew|last=Martin|date=2008-06-04|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]), a member of the [[CGIAR]] consortium, partners with farmers, governments, researchers and NGOs to help farmers grow nutritious crops, such as [[chickpea]], [[groundnut]], [[pigeonpea]], [[millet]] and [[sorghum]]. This helps their communities have more balanced diets and become more resilient to pests and drought. The Harnessing Opportunities for Productivity Enhancement of Sorghum and Millets in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian-Subcontinent (HOPE) project, for example, is increasing yields of [[eleusine coracana|finger millet]] in [[Tanzania]] by encouraging farmers to grow improved varieties. Finger millet is very high in calcium, rich in iron and fiber, and has a better energy content than other cereals. These characteristics make it ideal for feeding to infants and the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Alina Paul Bossuet, ''Nourishing Communities Through Holistic Farming'' {{cite web|url=http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 26, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123923/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/sorghum/882/249 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}.

In the early 21st century, there was relatively little awareness of hunger from leaders of advanced nations such as those that form the [[G8]].&lt;ref name="G202012"/&gt; Prior to 2009, efforts to fight hunger were mainly undertaken by governments of the worst affected countries, by civil society actors, and by multilateral and regional organizations. In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.&lt;ref&gt;

Food prices did fall sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action. However, since the 2009 G8 summit, the fight against hunger has remained a high-profile issue among the leaders of the worlds major nations, and was a prominent part of the agenda for the [[2012 G-20 Mexico summit|2012 G-20 summit]].&lt;ref name="G202012"&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] launched a "new alliance for food security and nutrition"—a broad partnership between private sector, governmental and civil society actors—that aimed to "...achieve sustained and inclusive agricultural growth and raise 50 million people out of poverty over the next 10 years."&lt;ref name="Ecologist-2014-04-03"&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_analysis/2343978/uk_aid_is_financing_a_corporate_scramble_for_africa.html UK 'aid' is financing a corporate scramble for Africa], Miriam Ross, ''[[The Ecologist]]'', 2014.04.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "2012G8"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/s/globalfoodsecurity/190282.htm G8 Action on Food Security and Nutrition] 2012 statement hosted by the US Department of State&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/18/remarks-president-symposium-global-agriculture-and-food-security Remarks by President concerning the launch of the ''new alliance for food security and nutrition'']&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's prime minister [[David Cameron]] held a [[2012 Olympic hunger summit|hunger summit]] on 12 August, the last day of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="2012G8"/&gt;

The fight against hunger has also been joined by an increased number of regular people. While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]].

This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.&lt;ref&gt;

Europe, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity. Especially since 2011, there has been a substantial increase in grass roots efforts to help the hungry by means of food banks, within both the UK and continental Europe.&lt;ref name = "modell"&gt;{{cite news  |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nqcbm |title= Britain's hidden hunger |publisher= [[BBC]] |author= [[David Model (journalist)|David Model]] |date = 30 October 2012 |accessdate= 4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Sahel Map-Africa rough.png|thumb|left|Affected areas in the western [[Sahel]] belt during the [[2012 Sahel drought|2012 drought]].]]
By July 2012, the [[2012 US drought]] had already caused a rapid increase in the price of grain and soy, with a knock on effect on the price of meat. As well as affecting hungry people in the US, this caused prices to rise on the global markets; the US is the world's biggest exporter of food. This led to much talk of a possible third 21st century global food crisis. The ''Financial Times'' reported that the [[BRICS]] may not be as badly affected as they were in the earlier crises of 2008 and 2011. However, smaller developing countries that must import a substantial portion of their food could be hard hit. The UN and [[G20]] has begun contingency planning so as to be ready to intervene if a third global crisis breaks out.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="US drought"&gt;

[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]
Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.&lt;ref name ="WB30Jul12"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide

In several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt. This changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].&lt;ref name = "HungerModHist"/&gt;
[[File:Starved_girl.jpg|thumb|183x183px|Starved girl]]

Researchers from the Centre for World Food Studies in 2003 found that the gap between levels of undernutrition in men and women is generally small, but that the gap varies from region to region and from country to country.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; These small-scale studies showed that female undernutrition prevalence rates exceeded male undernutrition prevalence rates in South/Southeast Asia and Latin America and were lower in Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Datasets for Ethiopia and Zimbabwe reported undernutrition rates between 1.5 and 2 times higher in men than in women; however, in India and Pakistan, datasets rates of undernutrition were 1.5-2 times higher in women than in men. Intra-country variation also occurs, with frequent high gaps between regional undernutrition rates.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nubé | first1 = M. | last2 = Van Den Boom | first2 = G.

Studies on nutrition concerning gender bias within households look at patterns of food allocation, and one study from 2003 suggested that women often receive a lower share of food requirements than men.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Gender discrimination, gender roles, and social norms affecting women can lead to early marriage and childbearing, close birth spacing, and undernutrition, all of which contribute to malnourished mothers.&lt;ref name="Factors in Bangladesh" /&gt;

Within the household, there may be differences in levels of malnutrition between men and women, and these differences have been shown to vary significantly from one region to another, with problem areas showing relative deprivation of women.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt; Samples of 1000 women in India in 2008 demonstrated that malnutrition in women is associated with poverty, lack of development and awareness, and illiteracy.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; The same study showed that gender discrimination in households can prevent a woman's access to sufficient food and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Women 2008" /&gt; How socialization affects the health of women in Bangladesh, Najma Rivzi explains in an article about a research program on this topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Najma Rizvi |publisher=dandc.eu |title=Enduring misery |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/bangladesh-does-not-guarantee-food-security-demanded-its-constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as in parts of Kenya in 2006, rates of malnutrition in pregnant women were even higher than rates in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Rachel Bonham|title=Survey Reveals High Malnutrition Rates Among Pregnant Women in Kenya|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_33782.html|publisher=UNICEF |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in some societies are traditionally given less food than men since men are perceived to have heavier workloads.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;  Household chores and agricultural tasks can in fact be very arduous and require additional energy and nutrients; however, physical activity, which largely determines energy requirements, is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Physiology====
Women have unique nutritional requirements, and in some cases need more nutrients than men; for example, women need twice as much calcium as men.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and Nutrition 2001|url=https://www.uthfa.com/gender-nutrition-2001/|publisher=Food and Agriculture of the United Nations |accessdate=August 22, 2016|date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pregnancy and breastfeeding====
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, women must ingest enough nutrients for themselves and their child, so they need significantly more protein and calories during these periods, as well as more vitamins and minerals (especially iron, iodine, calcium, folic acid, and vitamins A, C, and K).&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; In 2001 the FAO of the UN reported that iron deficiency afflicted 43 percent of women in [[developing countries]] and increased the risk of death during childbirth.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt; A 2008 review of interventions estimated that universal supplementation with calcium, iron, and folic acid during pregnancy could prevent 105,000 maternal deaths (23.6 percent of all maternal deaths).&lt;ref name="Bhutta 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhutta | first1 = Z.

Frequent pregnancies with short intervals between them and long periods of breastfeeding add an additional nutritional burden.&lt;ref name="Nube 2003" /&gt;

====Educating children====
According to the FAO, women are often responsible for preparing food and have the chance to educate their children about beneficial food and health habits, giving mothers another chance to improve the nutrition of their children.&lt;ref name="Gender and Nutrition 2001" /&gt;

'''Mario Mieli''' (21 May 1952, [[Milan]] – 12 March 1983) was a leading figure in the Italian [[gay]] movement of the 1970s. He combined a radical theoretical perspective with a provocative public persona. His sometimes outrageous public behavior made him a controversial figure, but he was nonetheless respected as one of the movement's most important intellectuals. He’s best known among English speakers for ''Towards a Gay Communism'', a political pamphlet excerpted from his major theoretical work ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''.

== Life ==
Mieli was born in [[Milan]] on May 21, 1952 into a large and prosperous family. He lived for the first sixteen years of his life on his family's estate near [[Como]]. He moved back to Milan with his family in 1968. Politically precocious, he threw himself into the student uprising of that year, beginning a long commitment to revolutionary causes.

In 1971 he moved to London as a student, where he took an active part in the London Gay Liberation Front. Though he spent intermittent time in London until 1975, in 1972 based himself in Milan where he studied at university. In April 1972, he, along with [[Massimo Consoli]] (1945–2007), Nicolino Tosoni (b. 1943), Angelo Pezzana (b. 1940) and the French writer [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] (1920–2005) held the first homosexual demonstration in Italy at a Congress of Sexology in [[Sanremo|San Remo]]. They protested against psychiatric condemnation of homosexual conduct and the use of aversion therapy to "convert" homosexuals.

In 1972, Mieli helped found the collective Fronte Unitario Omosessuale Rivoluzionario Italiano (Italian revolutionary homosexual united front). Better known by its acronym F.U.O.R.I! (Come out!), it was Italy's first major gay-rights group. Started in Turin in 1971, F.U.O.R.I! appeared almost simultaneously in Rome, Padua, Venice and in Milan, where Mieli was an organizer. After the collective united with the Italian Radical Party, Mieli criticized the move as "counter-revolutionary," since he thought the gay movement should remain independent of political parties. He left the organization over political differences in 1974–75.

After 1974 Mieli continued his activism by organizing the Collettivi Omosessuali Milanesi (Homosexual collectives of Milan). In 1976 the group’s gay theatrical group, Nostra Signora dei Fiori, staged his play ''La Traviata Norma. Ovvero: Vaffanculo... ebbene sì!'' (the title’s numerous puns defy translation). This outrageous production was successfully staged in Milan, Florence, and Rome. An in-your-face spectacle, it deliberately presented behavior designed to flout conventional, heterosexual norms.

A controversial personality, Mieli sometimes made a spectacle of himself. Once in Rome he publicly ate his own excrement and that of a dog.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} While some may have found this behavior outrageous or frightening, others knew him as a gentle person who enjoyed [[cross-dressing]], capable of being very charming in private.

By 1976, Mieli had graduated and began revising for publication his doctoral thesis in Moral Philosophy. The revision was published as ''Elementi di critica omosessuale''. An English translation of the book was made by [[David Fernbach]] as ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''. The translation’s last chapter – "Towards a Gay Communism"—was excerpted as a political pamphlet and became Mieli’s most widely known work among English speakers.

This major theoretical work is widely considered the most important text from the Italian gay community. With rich humor and a cosmopolitan gay sensibility, Mieli contends that homosexual liberation is an integral and indispensable part of a much wider emancipation. Mieli cites "educastration" at the core of a repressive set of norms intended to stifle the full expression of a natural human [[transsexuality]]. He combines [[Freud]]'s ideas on "polymorphous perversion" (see [[Polymorphous perverse]]) with [[Marxist economics]] to argue that human liberation is possible only through a revolution allowing uninhibited [[pansexuality]].

By 1981, Mieli became increasingly pessimistic about his cause. In 1983, he told friends about a forthcoming book titled ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' (''The Awakening of the Pharaohs''). It was to be an autobiographical novel, set in Egypt featuring a resurrected Jesus. However, in early March, he decided to stop publication of the book, writing in a letter to a friend that the book might inspire someone to "have his hide". In another letter dated March 11, he wrote, "My book will not be published by my free choice".

Mario Mieli killed himself the following day, on March 12, 1983. He died at age 30 from asphyxiation by inhaling gas in his Milan apartment.

It seems that Mieli's suicide stemmed from adverse reaction he expected from the book’s publication. Although a pirated edition was later published, his family brought legal action and had all copies destroyed. Only in 1994 was ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' published legally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21508">'''Meta-emotion''' is "an organized and structured set of emotions and cognitions about the emotions, both one's own emotions and the emotions of others".&lt;ref name=Gottmanetal&gt;Gottman, J. M., Katz, L. F., &amp; Hooven, C. (1997). Meta-emotion: How families communicate emotionally. Hillsdale, NJ, England: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; This broad definition of meta-emotion sparked psychologists' interest in the topic, particularly regarding parental meta-emotion philosophy.

Meta-emotion refers to the idea that whenever we elicit a certain emotion, we also deal with subsequent emotions regarding how we experienced the primary emotion. While some psychologists have examined the influence of meta-emotions on how individuals interpret and deal with their own and others' emotions, much of the literature regarding meta-emotion has focused on how parental meta-emotion impacts the social-emotional development of their children.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari, M., &amp; Koyama, E. (2002). Meta-emotions about anger and amae: A cross-cultural comparison. Consciousness &amp; Emotion, 3(2), 197-211. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/620031891&lt;/ref&gt; Meta-emotions can be short-term or long-term. The latter can be a source of discouragement or even [[psychological repression]], or encouragement of specific emotions, having implications for personality traits, [[psychodynamics]], family and [[group dynamics]], [[organizational climate]], emotional disorders, but also emotional [[awareness]], and [[emotional intelligence]].

==Research by Gottman==
In 1997, Gottman, Katz, &amp; Hooven used the term '''meta-emotion''' to describe parents' reactions to their children's emotional displays.&lt;ref&gt;Mitmansgruber, H., Beck, T. N., Höfer, S., &amp; Schüßler, G. (2009). When you don't like what you feel: Experiential avoidance, mindfulness and meta-emotion in emotion regulation. Personality and Individual Differences, 46(4), 448-453. {{doi|10.1016/j.paid.2008.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker, Fenning, &amp; Crnic (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. K., Fenning, R. M., &amp; Crnic, K. A. (2011). Emotion socialization by mothers and fathers: Coherence among behaviors and associations with parent attitudes and childrens social competence. Social Development, 20(2), 412-430. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9507.2010.00585.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined meta-emotion philosophy as "parental attitudes toward emotion".   

Broadly speaking, meta-emotion encompasses both feelings and thoughts about emotion. According to Gottman et al. (2006),&lt;ref name=Gottman&gt;Gottman, J. M., Katz, L. F., &amp; Hooven, C. (1996). Parental meta-emotion philosophy and the emotional life of families: Theoretical models and preliminary data. Journal of Family Psychology, 10(3), 243-268. {{doi|10.1037/0893-3200.10.3.243}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term meta-emotion does not merely refer to an individual's emotional reactions to his or her own emotions, but refers also to the "executive functions of emotion" (243). Greenberg (2002)&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, L. S. (2002). Emotion-focused therapy: Coaching clients to work through their feelings. Washington, DC, US: American Psychological Association. {{doi|10.1037/10447-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that meta-emotions are to be considered a type of "secondary emotion", a temporal concept in which a secondary emotion follows a primary emotion. For example, anxiety (the secondary emotion) may follow anger (the primary emotion).  

The term meta-emotion was unexpectedly coined as a result of the initial work of Gottman et al. (1996). For years, developmental psychology research has focused on parental affect, responsiveness, and parenting style. Gottman, Katz, &amp; Hooven (1996) believed that there was not enough attention given to parents' feelings and thoughts about their own emotions and their children's emotions. While researching the effects of parents' marital relationship on children, Gottman et al. (1996) found that there was a large variety of attitudes and philosophies that parents held about their own emotions and their children's emotions.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt;  In order to examine these differences, Katz &amp; Gottman (1986) developed a meta-emotion interview and deemed the term "meta-emotion structure", to refer to parents' feelings about feelings. They believed that meta-emotion was a "pervasive and understudied dimension in emotion research" (250). Katz &amp; Gottman (1986) paralleled their concept of meta-emotion with that of the meta-cognition construct [[Metacognition]].&lt;ref name=KatzGottman&gt;Katz, L. F., &amp; Gottman, J. M. (1999).  Parent meta-emotion interview. Seattle, WA: University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; Hooven, Gottman, &amp; Katz (1995)&lt;ref name=HoovenGottmanKatz&gt;Hooven, C., Gottman, J. M., &amp; Katz, L. F. (1995). Parental meta-emotion structure predicts family and child outcomes. Cognition and Emotion, 9(2-3), 229-264. {{doi|10.1080/02699939508409010}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the term "meta-emotion structure" to refer to "the parents' awareness of specific emotions, their awareness and acceptance of these emotions in their child, and their coaching of the emotion in their child" (231). The results of their study demonstrated that parental meta-emotion variables were related to their abilities to both interact with their children and resolve marital conflict. Gottman, Katz &amp; Hooven (1996) suggested that parents' own feelings and thoughts about their emotions strongly influence the ways in which they parent.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt;

===Types of parental meta-emotion philosophy===
In their paper published in 1996, Gottman, Katz &amp; Hooven outlined different types of parental meta-emotion philosophy. These include emotion-coaching philosophy and a dismissing meta-emotion philosophy.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt; That there are two major meta-emotion philosophies continues to be the general consensus among psychologists studying meta-emotion: emotion-coaching philosophy, in which the parents are comfortable with the emotions of themselves and their children, and an emotion-dismissing philosophy in which parents view negative emotions as harmful.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. K., Fenning, R. M., &amp; Crnic, K. A. (2011). Emotion socialization by mothers and fathers: Coherence among behaviors and associations with parent attitudes and childrens social competence. Social Development, 20(2), 412-430. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9507.2010.00585.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emotion-coaching philosophy====
Parents who follow an emotion-coaching philosophy tend to be aware of their emotions and the emotions of others. They are able to talk about these emotions and help their children understand and express their emotions, particularly sadness and anger. The authors found a distinction between emotion-coaching philosophy and parental warmth.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt;

There are five major characteristics of the emotion-coaching philosophy:
* The parent is aware of the child's emotion.
* The parent sees the child's emotion as an opportunity for intimacy or teaching.
* The parent helps the child to verbally label the emotions the child is having.
* The parent empathizes with or validates the child's emotion.
* The parent helps the child to problem solve (280).&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt;

A crucial aspect of the emotion-coaching philosophy is that the parent utilizes the child's negative emotions to form an emotional connection with their child, primarily for the reasons of intimacy and teaching.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt;

====Dismissive philosophy====
Parents with a dismissing meta-emotion philosophy feel as though their child's anger or sadness could be harmful to their child, that their primary job is to alleviate these harmful emotions as quickly as possible, and that their child should know that these negative emotions will not last. Although parents with a dismissing philosophy may be sensitive to their child's emotions and truly want to be helpful, these parents believe that ignoring or denying negative emotions is the best approach to helping their children. Parents with a dismissing meta-emotion philosophy are often unable to provide insight into their child's emotions and do not view negative emotions as an opportunity for growth or intimacy.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt; Parents may partake in a dismissing approach by attempting to distract the child or belittling the causes of the negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt;

====Disapproving philosophy====
Another possible type of parental meta-emotion is the disapproving philosophy. These parents reprimand their children for any type of emotional expression, even if the child's actions are appropriate. As a result, these children start to view their emotions as inappropriate and invalid, and have a difficult time with emotion regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Gottman, J. &amp; DeClaire, J. (1997). Raising an emotionally intelligent child: The heart of parenting. Fireside; New York.&lt;/ref&gt; For disapproving parents, negative emotions require a disciplinary response. Some disapproving parents may view their child's negative emotions as a means by which the child is attempting to manipulate or control the parent.&lt;ref name=Gottman /&gt;

===Impact of parental meta-emotion on children and adolescents===
There have been many studies examining the impact of different parental meta-emotion philosophies on adolescents. For example, researchers have studied the relation between meta-emotion philosophy and adolescent depression, as well as the impact of parental meta-emotion on adolescent affect and coping skills. Other psychologists have examined the impact of maternal meta-emotion philosophy on children's [[Attachment theory|attachment inclination]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, K., Cheng, S., &amp; Yang, Y. (2005). The influence of maternal meta-emotion philosophy on children's. Chinese Journal of Psychology, 47(2), 195-196. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/620834431&lt;/ref&gt;

Gottman et al. (1997)&lt;ref name="Gottmanetal"/&gt; highlighted two specific aspects of parental meta-emotion that impact children and family outcomes: 1) emotional awareness, and 2) emotion coaching. Gottman, Katz, &amp; Hooven—among the leading psychologists regarding meta-emotion—firmly believe in the significant impact of parental meta-emotion on many aspects of their children's lives: "There is evidence that from the beginning of a child's life, parents' interaction with the child has implications for the child's ability to self-regulate, focus attention, share intersubjective meaning, for the essential affectional bonds with parents, and be able to interact with a changing environment" (87).&lt;ref name=Gottmanetal /&gt;

There has been a growing interest in examining the impact of the various types of parental meta-emotion philosophies on children's emotional states and [[Child depression|depressive symptoms]]. For example, Hunter et al. (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, E. C., Katz, L. F., Shortt, J. W., Davis, B., Leve, C., Allen, N. B., &amp; Sheeber, L. B. (2011). How do I feel about feelings? Emotion socialization in families of depressed and healthy adolescents. Journal of Youth and Adolescence, 40(4), 428-441. {{doi|10.1007/s10964-010-9545-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the associations between the meta-emotion philosophies of fathers, mothers, and adolescents. They found that when parents held an emotion-coaching philosophy, the adolescents tended to have fewer behavioral and emotional issues. They concluded that: "The quality of the meta-emotion philosophy developed by adolescents may have implications for their mental health. In particular, evidence suggests that beliefs about emotion are relevant to depressive disorders, with negative beliefs associated with an increased risk for adolescent depression."  Similarly, Katz &amp; Hunter (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Katz, L. F., &amp; Hunter, E. C. (2007). Maternal meta-emotion philosophy and adolescent depressive symptomatology. Social Development, 16(2), 343-360. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9507.2007.00388.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the effects of maternal meta-emotion on adolescent depressive symptoms. The authors found that adolescents with high levels of depressive symptoms tended to have mothers who were less accepting of their own emotions. Mothers who were more accepting of their own emotions tended to have adolescents with higher self-esteem, fewer externalizing problems, and fewer depressive symptoms. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a strong correlation between maternal meta-emotion philosophy and adolescent depression. Thus, these authors suggest that meta-emotion philosophy is related to adolescent [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[Affect (psychology)|affect]].

Another study found that mothers with a meta-emotion philosophy that is higher in both awareness and acceptance were correlated with fewer negative social behaviors during mother-child interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Yap, M. B. H., Allen, N. B., Leve, C., &amp; Katz, L. F. (2008). Maternal meta-emotion philosophy and socialization of adolescent affect: The moderating role of adolescent temperament. Journal of Family Psychology, 22(5), 688-700. {{doi|10.1037/a0013104}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that maternal meta-emotion philosophy also influences the interactions between the mother and her adolescent. It would be interesting to examine whether or not this holds true for fathers and their adolescents as well. 

Aside from examining the impact of parental meta-emotion on children's affect and depressive symptomatology, some psychologists have researched the influence of meta-emotion on the development of children's coping strategies. Lagacé-Séguin &amp; Gionet (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Lagacé-Séguin, D., &amp; Gionet, A. (2009). Parent meta-emotion and temperament predict coping skills in early adolescence.  International Journal of Adolescence and Youth, 14, 367-382.&lt;/ref&gt; were interested in studying the nature versus nurture debate regarding children's development of coping strategies. To do so, they examined the impact of both temperament (nature) and parental meta-emotion philosophy (nurture) on the development of coping skills in early adolescents. The authors found many interactions between parental meta-emotion and the adolescent's temperament. For example, they found that emotion-coaching parenting was related to distraction coping strategies for children with lower negative affect and higher [[surgency]]. The authors concluded that parental meta-emotion philosophy styles can interact with a child's temperament and predict the adolescents' coping styles.

=== Impact on marital conflict or stability ===
Gottman et al.&lt;ref name =Gottmanetal /&gt; examined whether meta-emotion variables applied solely to [[parenting styles]] or if these variables also impacted a couple's marriage.  To examine this question, Gottman et al. examined the longitudinal stability of the participants' marriage and how the couples resolved their conflicts. They assessed both parents' sadness and anger meta-emotions.
 
==== Fathers ====
Gottman et al. found that fathers who are more aware of their sadness were more affectionate and have wives who were "less contemptuous and belligerent"&lt;ref name= Gottmanetal /&gt; (198).  Fathers who followed an emotion-coaching philosophy with concern to both sadness and anger were less defensive and more affectionate, but fathers who were merely aware of their own anger and their child's anger were more defensive and belligerent.  Thus, the father's awareness of his anger was not necessarily a positive quality with concern to his marriage.  On the other hand, fathers who maintained an emotion-coaching philosophy were more affectionate with their spouses and have wives who were also more affectionate and less contemptuous.

==== Mothers ====
Gottman et al.&lt;ref name =Gottmanetal /&gt; examined mothers' sadness and anger meta-emotions as well.  They found that mothers who were aware of their own sadness and their children's sadness were less belligerent, and had husbands who were also less belligerent and contemptuous.  Mothers who followed an emotion-coaching philosophy with concern to sadness tended to have husbands were "less disgusted and less belligerent" (201).  Gottman et al. found that mothers who were aware of their children's anger were less contemptuous, but also less affectionate toward their husbands.  They concluded that for mothers, awareness of their child's emotions had a positive impact on marital interaction, but for fathers, awareness of his child's anger did not have positive implications for his marriage.&lt;ref name= Gottmanetal /&gt;
===Friendships in adolescence===
Rowsell et al. studied relationship between meta-emotion and friendships in adolescence. Students from five Australian high schools completed questionnaires. The total sample of participants was 795.  They found that emotion identification skill in early adolescence was predictive of friendships for females in late adolescence. Specifically, girls starting out with low emotion identification skill in Grade 8 tended to have fewer female friendships and more male friendships in Grade 12. There were no effects for males. Lower initial  emotion identification skill was associated with significant improvements in awareness over time, but these improvements had no effect on friendships in Grade 12. The emotion identification skill that girls enter high school with may influence their friendship composition into late adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowsell|first=H. Claire|author2=Joseph Ciarrochi|title=The role of emotion identification skill in the formation of male and female friendships: A longitudinal study|journal=Journal of Adolescence|date=February 2014|volume=37|issue=2|page=103-111|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197113001693|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2013.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measuring meta-emotion philosophy===
The meta-emotion interview is the most widely used measurement tool of meta-emotion.  Each parent is separately interviewed about their own encounters with anger and sadness, their beliefs about emotional expression, and their attitudes and responses to their children's sadness and anger. This interview was semi-structured, allowing for flexibility for both the interviewer and the interviewee. The interview was audio-taped and designed to evaluate three dimensions of meta-emotion for sadness and anger: the parent's awareness of their own emotion, their awareness of the child's emotion, and the coaching of the child's emotion.&lt;ref name =Gottmanetal /&gt;

Gottman, Katz, &amp; Hooven updated their first meta-emotion interview&lt;ref name=Gottmanetal /&gt; to target parents' awareness of their own emotions and their children's emotions, as well as the parents' method of interacting with their children when the child is actively experiencing emotions. The interview outlines four types of parenting styles: emotion-coaching, laissez-faire, dismissing, and disapproving. It is an hour-long structured interview that is scored from audio-tapes&lt;ref&gt;Hakim-Larson, J., Parker, A., Lee, C., Goodwin, J., &amp; Voelker, S. (2006). Measuring parental meta-emotion: Psychometric properties of the emotion-related parenting styles self-test. Early Education and Development, 17(2), 229-251. {{doi|10.1207/s15566935eed1702_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary goal of the most recent Meta-Emotion Interview (MEI) is to gain a clear idea of how an individual experiences a particular emotion. Although it was first used to examine the emotions of sadness and anger, it has since been expanded to include pride and love/affection. The MEI focuses on one emotion at a time—all the questions are answered about one particular emotion (i.e.: sadness) before the interviewer moves on to the next emotion. For each emotion, the individual is first asked about their childhood and how their family handled and expressed each emotion. Then, they are asked about how they experience the emotion now. The questions particularly target how they experience each emotion in their relationships with their spouse and/or child. The MEI also addresses nonverbal expressions of emotion. For example, the interviewer asks what the individual looks like when he or she experiences a particular emotion (i.e.: "What do you look like when you are sad?"). The MEI is videotaped and then coded using the MEI Coding System, which focuses on four main dimensions of emotion: awareness, acceptance, dysregulation, and coaching. Awareness refers to the extent to which the individual acknowledges that they are experiencing an emotion. Acceptance refers to whether the individual not only allows themselves to experience the emotion, but also feels comfortable expressing it. Dysregulation relates to the individual's reported difficulties regulating their expression of the particular emotion. Finally, coaching refers to the degree to which individuals are able to identify and accept others' (i.e.: spouse or child) emotional experience in a positive manner.&lt;ref&gt;Manusov, V. L. (2005). The sourcebook of nonverbal measures: Going beyond words. Mahwah, N.J: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lagacé-Séguin &amp; Coplan (2005) constructed the first published self-report parenting scale (the Maternal Emotional Styles Questionnaire) used to measure emotion coaching and emotion dismissing meta-emotion philosophy.  The psychometric properties (i.e, reliability and validity) of the MESQ were found to be more than acceptable and the measure has been used in conjunction with child temperament to predict social outcomes for children based on theory of Goodness of Fit (Lagacé-Séguin &amp; Coplan,2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5640">'''Moisture stress''' occurs when the water in a plant's cells is reduced to less than normal levels.  This can occur because of a lack of water in the plant's root zone, higher rates of [[transpiration]] than the rate of moisture uptake by the roots, for example, because of an inability to absorb water due to a high [[salt]] content in the soil water or loss of roots due to transplantation. Moisture stress is more strongly related to [[water potential]] than it is to [[water content]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.155.3767.1248

Moisture stress also has an effect on [[stoma]]tal openings of a plant, mainly causing a closure in stomata as to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide [[Carbon fixation|assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=    16662343 | volume=69 | issue=5 | title=Leaf water potential, stomatal resistance, and photosynthetic response to water stress in peach seedlings | pmc=426357 | year=1982 | journal=Plant Physiol. | pages=1051–4 | last1 = Hand | first1 = JM | last2 = Young | first2 = E | last3 = Vasconcelos | first3 = AC | doi=10.1104/pp.69.5.1051}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closing of the stomata also slows the rate of transpiration, which limits water loss and helps to prevent the [[wilting]] effects of moisture stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological Science: Fifth Edition|last=Freeman|first=Scott|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-0-321-74367-1|location=USA|pages=765}}&lt;/ref&gt; This closing can be trigged by the roots sensing dry soil and in response producing the hormone ABA which when transported up the xylem into the leaves will reduce [[stomatal conductance]] and wall extensibility of growing cells.  This lowers the rates of transpiration, photosynthesis and leaf expansion. ABA also increases the loosening of growing root cell walls and in turn increases root growth in an effort to find water in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Lambers, Hans; Chapin II, F. Stuart; Pons, Thijs L. (2008). Plant physiological Ecology. New York, NY: Springer. p. 349. {{ISBN|978-0-387-78340-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phenotypic response of plants to long-term water stress was measured in corn and showed that plants respond to water stress with both an increase in root growth both laterally and vertically. In all Droughted conditions the corn showed decrease in plant height and yield due to the decrease in water availability.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, J.E. (1926) Root Development of Field Crops. McGraw Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genes induced during water-stress conditions are thought to function not only in protecting cells from water deficit by the production of important metabolic proteins but also in the regulation of genes for signal transduction in the water-stress response. There are four pathways that have been described that show the plants genetic response to moisture stress; two are ABA dependent while two are ABA independent. They all affect gene expression that increases the plants water stress tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shinozaki | first1 = K. | last2 = Yamaguchi-Shinozaki | first2 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Gene Expression and Signal Transduction in Water-Stress Response | url = | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 115 | issue = 2| pages = 327–334 | doi=10.1104/pp.115.2.327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of moisture stress on photosynthesis can depend as much on the velocity and degree of photosynthetic recovery, as it depends on the degree and velocity of photosynthesis decline during water depletion. Plants that are subjected to mild stress can recover in 1–2 days however, plants subjected to severe water stress will only recover 40-60% of its maximum photosynthetic rates the day after re watering and may never reach maximum photosynthetic rates. The recovery from moisture stress starts with an increase in water content in leaves reopening the stomata then the synthesis of photosynthetic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaves|first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">[[File:Poster-museumofchristianart.jpg|thumb|Poster from the Museum of Christian Art, Goa.]]The '''Museum of Christian Art''', in the former colonial capital of [[Old Goa]], is a museum of [[Christian art]].

==About==

The [[museum]] is located in the [[Convent of Santa Monica]] in [[Old Goa]], [[Goa]]. It is open from 9.30 am to 5 pm on all days, Monday to Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028221617/http://museumofchristianart.com/?flag=MU# |archive-date=2013-10-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a project of the [[Archdiocese of Goa]] and was set up with technical and financial assistance from the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation]], [[Portugal]] and the [[Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage]] ([[INTACH]]), [[New Delhi]]. Earlier, it was located at the [[Seminary of Rachol]], [[Salcete]], [[Goa]].

==Exhibits==

Its exhibits are divided into the following categories:
* [[Sculptures]]
* [[Furniture]]
* [[Ivory]]
* [[Paintings]]
* [[Textiles]]
* [[Precious Metals]]
* [[Metals]]
* Miscellaneous

==Statuary, paintings, sculptures==

The ''[[Lonely Planet]]'' says: "Within the [[Convent of St. Monica]], the excellent Museum of Christian Art contains statuary, paintings and sculptures transferred here from the [[Rachol Seminary]]. Many of the works of [[Goan]] [[Christian art]] during the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] era were produced by local [[Hindu]] artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130092135/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/goa/old-goa/sights/museum/museum-christian-art# |archive-date=2012-01-30 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious silverware==

''[[Fodors]]'', another [[travel guide]], notes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207105925/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/goa/review-445833.html# |archive-date=2013-12-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the museum is located inside the [[Convent of St. Monica]], and "has a number of objects of [[Christian]] interest, including paintings and religious silverware, some dating back to the 16th century." It also notes that this convent was the first nunnery of its kind in the [[East]] and continued until the late 19th century.

==Christian art, elsewhere==

In [[Goa]], the [[Goa State Museum]] also houses a Christian Art Gallery. In August 2011, [[Mumbai]] also announced plans to open its museum of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-16/mumbai/29891827_1_church-artefacts-museum-christianity&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art heist==

In January 2012, a major art heist was reported&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-01-26/goa/30666486_1_security-guard-museum-burgled&lt;/ref&gt; at the museum. There was no detailed listing of the items that were stolen, in a case which saw a security guard being killed.

The '''National Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program''' ('''NAHDAP''') is a [[Digital library|repository]] of drug abuse and [[HIV/AIDS research]] data primarily including social science and behavioral data.&lt;ref&gt;''Addiction,'' 106, 1708-1710&lt;/ref&gt; NAHDAP’s mission is to bring the power of science to bear on drug abuse and addiction by supporting research across a wide range of disciplines and ensuring the rapid and effective dissemination and use of the results of that research to improve prevention, treatment and policy.

==Description==

NAHDAP is a program within the [[ICPSR|Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)]], a unit in the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the [[University of Michigan]]. NAHDAP's staff consists of professional researchers, data archivists and technicians working together to obtain, process, distribute, and promote amongst social science researchers [[Data sharing|sharing of data]] relevant to drug addiction and HIV. 

NAHDAP is a project of the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The [http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/ NAHDAP Web site] launched in June 2010 and offers a library of electronic data and [[citations]] to publications based on those data. NAHDAP provides technical assistance and resources to investigators to facilitate preparing their data for archiving so that they can be easily and effectively archived at project completion. NAHDAP also provides technical assistance to users of the data sets, including workshops and webinars, to train analysts in the unique characteristics of selected datasets, in [[Quantitative research|quantitative method]]s, and in the utility of analyzing [[Secondary data analysis|secondary data]] for the [[Reproduceability|reproduction of original research findings]] and addressing new research questions on major issues of social and behavioral sciences and public policy.

In regard to agriculture, [[Abiotic stress]] is stress produced by '''natural environment factors''' such as extreme [[temperature]]s, [[wind]], [[drought]], and [[salinity]]. Humankind doesn’t have much control over abiotic stresses. It is very important for humans to understand how stress factors affect plants and other living things so that we can take some preventative measures. 

Preventative measures are the only way that humans can protect themselves and their possessions from abiotic stress. There are many different types of abiotic stressors, and several methods that humans can use to reduce the negative effects of stress on living things.

== Cold ==
One of the types of Abiotic Stress is [[cold]]. This has a huge impact on farmers. Cold impacts crop growers all over the world in every single country. Yields suffer and farmers also suffer huge losses because the weather is just too cold to produce crops (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001). 

Humans have planned the planting of our crops around the seasons. Even though the seasons are fairly predictable, there are always unexpected storms, heat waves, or cold snaps that can ruin our growing seasons.(Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006)

ROS stands for reactive oxygen species. ROS plays a large role in mediating events through transduction. Cold stress was shown to enhance the transcript, protein, and activity of different ROS-scavenging enzymes. Low temperature stress has also been shown to increase the H2 O2 accumulation in cells.(Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006)

Plants can be acclimated to low or even freezing temperatures. If a plant can go through a mild cold spell this activates the cold-responsive genes in the plant. Then if the temperature drops again, the genes will have conditioned the plant to cope with the low temperature. Even below freezing temperatures can be survived if the proper genes are activated (Suzuki &amp; Mittler, 2006).

== Heat ==
[[Heat]] stress has been shown to cause problems in [[mitochondrial]] functions and can result in [[oxidative]] damage. Activators of heat stress receptors and defenses are thought to be related to ROS. Heat is another thing that plants can deal with if they have the proper pretreatment. This means that if the temperature gradually warms up the plants are going to be better able to cope with the change. A sudden long temperature increase could cause damage to the plant because their cells and receptors haven’t had enough time to prepare for a major temperature change.

Heat stress can also have a detrimental effect on plant reproduction. Temperatures 10 degrees Celsius or more above normal growing temperatures can have a bad effect on several plant reproductive functions. Pollen [[meiosis]], pollen germination, [[ovule]] development, ovule viability, development of the embryo, and seedling growth are all aspects of plant reproduction that are affected by heat.(Cross, McKay, McHughen, &amp; Bonham-Smith, 2003)

There have been many studies on the effects of heat on plant reproduction. One study on plants was conducted on [[Canola]] plants at 28 degrees Celsius, the result was decreased plant size, but the plants were still fertile. Another experiment was conducted on Canola plants at 32 degrees Celsius, this resulted in the production of sterile plants. Plants seem to be more easily damaged by extreme temperatures during the late flower to early seed development stage (Cross, McKay, McHughen, &amp; Bonham-Smith, 2003).

== Wind ==
Wind is a huge part of abiotic stress. There is simply no way to stop the wind from blowing. This is definitely a bigger problem in some parts of the world than in others. Barren areas such as deserts are very susceptible to natural wind erosion. These types of areas don’t have any vegetation to hold the soil particles in place. Once the wind starts to blow the soil around, there is nothing to stop the process. The only chance for the soil to stay in place is if the wind doesn’t blow. This is usually not an option.

Plant growth in windblown areas is very limited. Because the soil is constantly moving, there is no opportunity for plants to develop a root system. Soil that blows a lot usually is very dry also. This leaves little [[nutrient]]s to promote plant growth.

Farmland is typically very susceptible to wind erosion. Most farmers do not plant cover crops during the seasons when their main crops are not in the fields. They simply leave the ground open and uncovered. When the soil is dry, the top layer becomes similar to powder. When the wind blows, the powdery top layer of the farmland is picked up and carried for miles. This is the exact scenario that occurred during the “Dust Bowl” in the 30’s. The combination of drought and poor farming practices allowed the wind to moves thousands of tons of dirt from one area to the next.

Wind is one of the factors that humans can really have some control over. Simply practice good farming practices. Don’t leave ground bare and without any type of vegetation. During dry seasons it is especially important to have the land covered because dry soil moves much easier than wet soil in the wind.

When soil is not blowing due to the wind, conditions are much better for plant growth. Plants cannot grow in a soil that is constantly blowing. Their root systems do not have time to be established. Also, when soil particles are blowing they wear away at the plants that they run into. Plants are essentially “sand blasted.”

== Drought ==
Drought is very detrimental to all types of plant growth. When there is no water in the soil there are not very many nutrients to support plant growth. Drought also enhances the effects of wind. When drought occurs the soil becomes very dry and light. The wind picks up this dry dirt and carries it away. This action severely degrades the soil and creates a poor condition for growing plants.

== Adaptation of plants ==
Plants have been exposed to the elements for thousands of years. During this time they have evolved in order to lessen the effects of abiotic stress. Signal transduction is the mechanism in plants that is responsible for the adaptation of plants (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001). Many signaling transduction networks have been discovered and studied in microbial and animal systems. There is limited knowledge in the plant field because it is very difficult to find exactly which phenotypes in the plant are affected by stressors. These phenotypes are very valuable to the researchers. They need to know the phenotypes so that they can create a method to screen for mutant genes. Mutants are the key to finding signaling pathways in living creatures.

&lt;nowiki&gt;Animals and microbes easier to run tests on because they show a reaction fairly quickly when a stress factor is put on them, this leads to the isolation of the specific gene.  There have been decades of research on the effects of temperature, drought, and salinity, but not very many answers.&lt;/nowiki&gt;

== Receptors ==
The part of the plants, animal, or microbe that first senses an abiotic stress factor is a receptor. Once a signal is picked up by a receptor, signals are transmitted intercellularly and then they activate nuclear transcription to get the effects of a certain set of genes. These activated genes  allow the plant to respond to the stress that it is experiencing. Even though none of the receptors for cold, drought, salinity or the stress hormone abscisic acid in plants is known for sure, the knowledge that we have today shows that receptor-like protein kinases, two-component histidine kinases, as well as G-protein receptors may be the possible sensors of these different signals.

Receptor like kinases can be found in plants as well as animals. There are many more RLKs in plants than there are in animals. They are also a little bit different. Unlike animal RLKs that usually possess tyrosine signature sequences, plant RLKs have serine or threonine signature sequences (Xiong &amp; Zhu, 2001).

== Genetically Modified Plants ==
Plants are most commonly modified to be resistant to specific [[herbicide]]s or [[pathogen]]s, but we have the technology to modify plants in order to make them resistant to specific abiotic stressors. Cold, heat, drought, or salt are all factors that could possibly be defended against by genetically modified plants.

Some plants could have genes added to them from other species of plants that have a resistance to a specific stress. Plants implanted with these genes would then become transgenic plants because they have the genes from another species of plant in them. Scientists first have to isolate the specific gene in a plant that is responsible for its resistance. The gene would then be taken out of the plant and put into another plant. The plant that is injected with the new resistant gene would have a resistance to an abiotic stressor and be able to tolerate a wider range of conditions (Weil, 2005).

This process of creating transgenic plants could have a huge impact on our nation’s economy. If plants could be genetically engineered to be resistant to a wider variety of stress, crop yields would skyrocket. With the expansion of town and cities there is a decreasing number of farm acres. Although the farm acres are being built on, the number of people consuming agriculture products is going up. Ethanol is also responsible for using much more of the corn that is grown here in the U.S. The production of this fuel has put a strain on the corn market. Prices of corn have gone up and this price is having a negative impact on the people who feed animals using corn. The combination of reduced acres of farmland and a higher demand on crops have left producers and consumers in a severe dilemma. The only solution to this problem is to keep getting higher and higher yields from the cropland that we have left.

Genetically modified plants are a good answer to the problem of not enough crops to go around. These plants can be engineered to be resistant to all types of abiotic stress. This would eliminate [[crop yield]] loss due to extreme temperatures, drought, wind, or salinity. The consumers of crops would enjoy a little bit lower prices because the demand on them would be a little lower.

The [[Midwest]]ern U.S. is experiencing a severe drought. Farmers are being limited on how much they can irrigate due to the shortage of water. There is also very little rain during the growing season so the crops do not yield very well. This problem could be solved by genetically modifying plants to become more drought resistant. If plants could use less water and produce yields that are superior or equal to current ones, it would be better for the people and also the environment. People would enjoy an abundance of crops to consume and export for a profit. The environment would be able to have more water in its aquifers and rivers throughout the country.

Another environmental factor that would be improved would be the amount of land left for [[wildlife]]. Crops modified to be resistant to abiotic stress and other factors that decrease yields would require less land use. Producers would be able to grow enough crops on less acres if the plants were modified to produce very high yields. This would allow some of the cropland that is in use today to be set aside for wildlife. Instead of farming “fence line to fence line” farmers would be able to create large buffers in their fields. These buffers would provide a great habitat for plants and animals.

A lot of people do not like genetically modified organisms. People opposed to these modified plants often claim that they are not safe for the environment or for human consumption. There are many videos and reports in circulation that discredit the safety of genetically modified organisms. [[King Corn (film)|King Corn]] is one video that claims that corn is bad for humans to consume.

There are strict regulations and protocols that go along with genetically modifying plants. A company that specializes in producing genetically modifying organisms must put their plants through a huge variety of tests to ensure the safety of their product. Each of these tests must be passed by the product in order to produce more of the plant seeds.

When seeds are mass-produced, the fields that they are grown in have to meet specific criteria. They must have no vegetation zones around them to prevent the spread of the modified plants into the native population. The plots must be carefully labeled and marked so that the company knows exactly what is planted in the field. All of these protocols are in place to ensure the safety of the consumers and also of the environment.
Because genetically modified plants are given stress resistant genes or high yielding genes they are better for the environment. They only help create more land to be put back into natural habitats for plants and animals.

== Conclusion ==
Abiotic stress is a naturally occurring factor that cannot be controlled by humans. One example of two stressors that are complimentary to each other is wind and drought. Drought dries out the soil and kills the plants that are growing in the soil. After this occurs, the soil is left barren and dry. Wind can pick up the soil and carry for miles. Irrigation can keep this from happening, but it is not possible to irrigate some areas.

Genetically modified plants can be implemented to slow down the effects of the abiotic stressors. This allows more crops to be grown on a smaller amount of land. Less need for farmland allows some of it to be set aside for natural wildlife habitat.

Abiotic stress only poses a problem to people or the environment if they are not prepared for it. There can be steps taken by humans to lessen the effects. Plants and animals have the ability to adapt to abiotic stress over time.

'''Neocatastrophism''' is the [[hypothesis]] that life-exterminating events such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s have acted as a galactic regulation mechanism in the [[Milky Way]] upon the emergence of complex [[life]] in its [[Galactic habitable zone|habitable zone]].&lt;ref name="Cirković08"&gt;Cirković MM, Vukotić B.

This is an avenue to explain why none so far have been detected by [[humans]].

==The problem==

It is estimated that Earth-like [[planet]]s in the Milky Way started forming 9 billion years ago, and that their [[median]] age is 6.4 ± 0.7 [[Ga (unit)|Ga]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver C.H. (2001). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0012399v2 An Estimate of the Age Distribution of Terrestrial Planets in the Universe: Quantifying Metallicity as a Selection Effect.] Icarus, 151:307-313 {{doi|10.1006/icar.2001.6607}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, 75% of stars in the [[galactic habitable zone]] are older than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Lineweaver CH, Fenner Y, Gibson BK. (2004). [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0401024 The galactic habitable zone and the age distribution of complex life in the Milky Way.] Science. 303(5654):59-62. {{DOI|10.1126/science.1092322}} {{PMID|14704421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the existence of potential planets with evolved intelligent life more likely than not to be older than that of the Earth ([[Age of the Earth|4.54 Ga]]). This creates an observational dilemma since [[interstellar travel]], (even of the "slow" kind that is nearly within the reach of present Earth technology) could in theory, if this had arisen elsewhere, take from only 5 million to 50 million years to colonize the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., [http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326090244/http://www.cc.nctu.edu.tw/~tseng327/nctu-origin/article/sc200007a.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}, '' Scientific American,'' July 2000, 38-43, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a conundrum first posed in 1950 by the physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] in his namesake paradox: "Why are no aliens or their artifacts physically here?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;Webb S. (2002). ''If the universe is teeming with aliens, where is everybody? Fifty solutions to the Fermi paradox and the problem of extraterrestrial life''. Copernicus Books (Springer Verlag)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The neocatastrophism resolution==
The hypothesis posits that [[Astrobiology|astrobiological evolution]] is subject to regulation mechanisms that arrest or postpone the advent of complex creatures capable of interstellar communication and traveling technology. These regulation mechanisms act to temporarily sterilize planets of biology in the [[galactic habitable zone]]. The main proposed regulation mechanism is gamma-ray bursts.&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt;

Part of the neocatastrophism hypothesis is that [[stellar evolution]] produces a decreasing frequency of such catastrophic events increasing the length of the "window" in which intelligent life might arise as galaxies age. According to modeling,&lt;ref name="Cirković08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ćirković09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CirkovicVukotic09"/&gt; this creates the possibility of a [[phase transition]] at which point a galaxy turns from a place that is essentially dead (with a few pockets of simple life) to one that is crowded with complex life forms.

[[File:Yarnton Manor east.JPG|thumb|[[Yarnton Manor]], the former location of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]]
The '''Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies''' ('''OCHJS''') is a [[Recognised Independent Centre]] of the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]. Its [[research fellows]] teach on a variety of undergraduate and master's degrees in [[Oriental studies]], and it publishes the ''[[Journal of Jewish Studies]]''.

==History and case statement==
The Centre was founded in 1972 by Dr David Patterson to help restore Jewish Studies in Europe in the aftermath of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/home/about/our-vision/ |title=Our vision and mission statement |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is based in the [[Clarendon Institute]], [[Walton Street]], [[Oxford]], OX1 2HG, having relocated from [[Yarnton Manor]] in 2014. It is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] and a company limited by guarantee incorporated in [[England]], under [[English law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|309720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is the leading academic Jewish studies centre in [[Europe]].{{fact|date=May 2018}} Its Fellows and Lecturers provide courses in Hebrew and Jewish studies for undergraduates and postgraduates up to doctoral level in many faculties within the [[University of Oxford]]. The Centre also promotes Jewish studies based on the [[Bodleian Library]]’s Hebrew and Jewish collections by supporting research, by development projects, and by shared staffing with the Centre’s Leopold Muller Memorial Library.

==Leopold Muller Memorial Library==
[[File:Milenamanor6.jpg|thumb|upright|Muller Library collections]]
The Centre's library is named the '''Leopold Muller Memorial Library'''. It is housed in the basement of the Clarendon Institute.  It comprises one of the best collections of books and periodicals in Jewish Studies in Europe and serves as a resource for scholars, students and visiting fellows of the Centre. The core of the Library consists of several rare collections and archives; among those one finds a large collection of materials donated by Rabbi [[Louis Jacobs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/louisjacobs.html |title=Louis Jacobs Collection – Leopold Muller Memorial Library |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331201859/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/louisjacobs.html |archivedate=31 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Loewe Pamphlets Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |title=Loewe Pamphlets – Leopold Muller Memorial Library |publisher=Ochjs.ac.uk |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315100643/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Herbert Loewe]] and his elder son, the library of Jacob H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9049">In [[literature]], '''pace''', or '''pacing''' is the speed at which a [[narrative|story]] is told—not necessarily the speed at which the story takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schellhardt|2008|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1999|pp=67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of words needed to write about a certain event does not depend upon how much time the event takes to happen; it depends upon how important that moment is to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pace is determined by the length of the [[Scene (drama)|scenes]], how fast the [[Action (narrative)|action]] moves, and how quickly the reader is provided with information.  It is also sometimes dictated by the [[genre]] of the story:  [[Comedy (drama)|comedies]] move faster than [[drama]]s; [[Adventure fiction|action adventures]] move faster than [[Thriller (genre)|suspense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Schellhardt|2008|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A dragging pace is characteristic of many novels turned down by publishers, and of some that find their way into print but not into the hearts and recommendations of readers.  Most rejected manuscripts move too slowly, encouraging readers to put them down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Methods ==
Storytellers have a number of writing tools at their disposal—for example, [[narration]], action, [[description]], and [[Dialogue in writing|dialogue]].  When considering how to pace a story, description and narration will move it along slowly, steadily, and easily, while action and dialogue will speed it up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of all the tools at a writer's disposal, dialogue is the one that most quickly puts the characters and the reader into the present moment, even more so than action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pace can be increased through:
* flipping forward past a scene that is in the story but never appears in the book&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* skipping steps in a logical sequence of events&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* short scenes&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* frequent paragraphing&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* short sentences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* dialogue&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* action&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* active voice and aggressive verbs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|pp=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* flab-cutting (removal of superfluous words and phrases, and unnecessary adjectives and adverbs)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Stein|1995|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pace can be decreased through:
* description and narration&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* introspection&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bishop|1988|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weaving ==
While ''dialogue'' is the element that brings a story and the characters to life on the page, ''action'' creates the movement, and ''narrative'' gives the story its depth and substance.  Writing a story means weaving all the elements of fiction together.  When this is done right, weaving dialogue, action, and narrative can create a beautiful tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pacing is probably the most common fiction element to pay attention to when considering when to and when not to weave dialogue, narrative, and action.  When creating a fast-paced conflict scene between two or more people, a writer might do well to consider only dialogue, at least for parts of it.  Perhaps the characters have just entered into an argument and the writer wants to speed up the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then there are times when a scene should move slowly, so it is not always best to use dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, reading slow-moving dialogue is preferable to reading lengthy passages of philosophical narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are scenes in all stories that work best using only narrative or only dialogue or only action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no definite rules about when to and when not to weave.  To weave well is to find the story's rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation ==
===Within a story===
A good [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is an exercise in proper balance.  By staying aware of the scenes' levels of intensity and writing accordingly, a writer can make novels fresh and memorable to their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|pp=127-128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning writers often give every moment in their stories the same weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in writing fiction, they are in charge of the way time moves.  They can pass quickly over what is unimportant, or even skip it entirely.  Then they can stretch out the events their readers care about.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bauer|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a time for telling and a time for showing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most stories are paced not too fast, but too slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, there is nothing less exciting than non-stop excitement, so writers must avoid the monotony of constant action and texture the pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Saville|2013|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing should be done with a consciousness of pacing and tension.  In the [[rising action]] of the story, reader interest can be maintained by upping the action ante with each succeeding scene.  The initial obstacle the hero overcomes should be smaller than the one that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Lamb|2008|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Between different stories===
Different kinds of stories call for different kinds of characters, tension, pacing, themes, and dialogue.  A fast-paced action adventure needs fast-paced dialogue in every scene to keep the story moving forward quickly.  Likewise, a literary story needs the dialogue to match the pace of the other elements in the story—it needs to move more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Genre stories generally move quickly, employing more dialogue and action and less slow-paced narrative, because they are generally plot-driven rather than character-driven, like literary and mainstream stories.  The emphasis is on the action that keeps the plot moving rather than the narrative that keeps the character growing.  It pays to know the characters because who they are determines how slowly or quickly they talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kempton|2004|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Carl Schank''' (born 1946) is an American [[artificial intelligence]] theorist, [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]], [[learning sciences|learning scientist]], educational reformer, and [[entrepreneur]].

Beginning in the late 1960s, he pioneered [[conceptual dependency theory]] (within the context of [[natural language understanding]]) and [[case-based reasoning]], both of which challenged [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views of memory and reasoning.

In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a 10-year commitment to his research and development by [[Andersen Consulting]], through which he founded the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago.

For his undergraduate degree, Schank studied mathematics at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]&lt;ref name="shank_tank"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freedman|first1=David|title=The Schank Tank|url=https://www.wired.com/1994/08/schank/|website=Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh PA]], and later was awarded a PhD in [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Texas]] in Austin and went on to work in faculty positions at [[Stanford University]] and then at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=freedman&gt;{{Cite news| volume = 2| issue = 8| last = Freedman| first = David H.| title = The Schank Tank| work = Wired| accessdate = 2011-10-04| date = August 1994| url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.08/schank_pr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he became professor of [[computer science]] and [[psychology]] at Yale University. In 1981, Schank became Chairman of Computer Science at Yale and director of the Yale Artificial Intelligence Project.&lt;ref name=bio1&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Part 1 of 2|work=RogerSchank.com|url=http://www.rogerschank.com/biography.html|year=2009|accessdate=October 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006130700/http://www.rogerschank.com/biography.html|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a 10-year commitment to his research and development by [[Accenture|Andersen Consulting]], allowing him to leave Yale and set up the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago, bringing along 25 of his Yale colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Glenn|last=Rifkin|title= Andersen Consulting's Culture of 'Clones'|work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/06/business/andersen-consulting-s-culture-of-clones.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|date=September 6, 1992|accessdate= September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILS attracted other corporate sponsors such as [[IBM]] and [[Ameritech]], as well as government sponsors such as the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]],&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt; leading to a focus on the development of educational software,&lt;ref name=freedman /&gt; especially in employee training.&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Part 2 of 2|work=RogerSchank.com|url=http://www.rogerschank.com/biography-part2.html|year=2009|accessdate=October 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006151508/http://www.rogerschank.com/biography-part2.html|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILS was later absorbed by the School of Education as a separate department.

When Carnegie Mellon University's [[Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley|Silicon Valley campus]] was established in 2002, Schank came to serve as Chief Educational Officer at the institution.&lt;ref name=socratic /&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
While at Yale in 1979, Schank was among the first to "capitalize on the expected boom"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|work= New York Times|title=Selling artificial intelligence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/business/selling-artificial-intelligence.html|date=September 13, 1982|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in AI when he founded Cognitive Systems, a company that went public in 1986. Schank resigned as chairman and chief executive in 1988 for personal reasons, but stayed as a board member and advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top officer resigns at Cognitive Systems|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/business/business-people-top-officer-resigns-at-cognitive-systems.html|date=June 24, 1988|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Schank founded Cognitive Arts Corporation&lt;ref name=socratic&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Schank|work=Socratic Arts |url=http://www.socraticarts.com/about.cfm?lead=Roger-Schank|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally named Learning Sciences Corporation) to market the software developed at ILS, and led the company until it was sold in 2003.

From 2005 to 2007, Schank was the chief learning officer of Trump University.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trump-university-i-state-accreditation-issue-roger-schank&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he founded Socratic Arts, a company that sells e-learning software to both businesses and schools.&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt;

In 2008, Schank built a story-centered curriculum (SCC) at the Business Engineering School of La Salle International Graduate School of [[Ramon Llull University]], Barcelona to teach MBA students to launch their own businesses or to go to work.&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt;

In 2012, Schank founded XTOL (Experiential Training Online) which "designs learn-by-doing experiential short courses for use by universities, corporations and professional organizations, as well as Master's programs in partnership with degree-granting universities around the world."&lt;ref name=xtol&gt;{{cite web|title=XTOL (Experiential Training Online)|url=http://www.xtolcorp.com/|accessdate=January 21, 2014| website=XTOL Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational reform==
Schank believes that the educational system is fundamentally broken and that software will need to replace conventional teaching methods.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Green|title=No Lectures or Teachers, Just Software|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20000811friday.html| date=August 11, 2000|accessdate=October 10, 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; To serve this purpose, he founded Engines for Education in 2001, a not-for-profit organization which designs and implements curricula for primary and secondary schools&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt; and hosts the Virtual International Science and Technology Academy (VISTA).

==Influence==
Schank was a leading pioneer of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive psychology]] in the 1970s and 1980s. His innovations in these fields were [[conceptual dependency theory]] and [[case-based reasoning]], both of which challenged [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views of memory and reasoning.

In 1969 Schank introduced the [[conceptual dependency theory]] for [[natural language understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| pages = 1–3| last = Schank| first = Roger| title = A conceptual dependency parser for natural language| booktitle =  Proceedings of the 1969 conference on Computational linguistics| location = Sång-Säby, Sweden| year = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model, partly based on the work of [[Sydney Lamb]], was extensively used by Schank's students at [[Yale University]], such as [[Robert Wilensky]], Wendy Lehnert, and [[Janet Kolodner]].

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is based on Schank's model of dynamic memory&lt;ref name="ref_schank"&gt;Roger Schank, Dynamic Memory: ''A Theory of Learning in Computers and People'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and was the basis for the earliest CBR systems: [[Janet Kolodner|Janet Kolodner's]] CYRUS&lt;ref name="ref_kolodner"&gt;Janet Kolodner, "Reconstructive Memory: A Computer Model," ''Cognitive Science'' 7 (1983): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Lebowitz's IPP.&lt;ref name="ref_lebowitz"&gt;Michael Lebowitz, "Memory-Based Parsing," ''Artificial Intelligence'' 21 (1983), 363-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other schools of CBR and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s, investigating such topics as CBR in legal reasoning, memory-based reasoning (a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines), and combinations of CBR with other reasoning methods.  In the 1990s, interest in CBR grew, as evidenced by the establishment of an International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning in 1995, as well as European, German, British, Italian, and other CBR workshops.

CBR technology has produced a number of successful deployed systems, the earliest being Lockheed's CLAVIER,&lt;ref name="ref_mark"&gt;Bill Mark, "Case-Based Reasoning for Autoclave Management," ''Proceedings of the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; a system for laying out composite parts to be baked in an industrial convection oven. CBR has been used extensively in [[help desk]] applications such as the Compaq SMART system&lt;ref name="ref_nguyen"&gt;Trung Nguyen, Mary Czerwinski, and Dan Lee, "COMPAQ QuickSource: Providing the Consumer with the Power of Artificial Intelligence," in ''Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence'' (Washington, DC: AAAI Press, 1993), 142-151.&lt;/ref&gt; and has found a major application area in the health sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2071862| issn = 1094-6977| volume = 41| issue = 4| pages = 421–434| last = Begum| first = S.|author2=M.

In [[software engineering]], '''service virtualization''' is a method to emulate the behavior of specific components in heterogeneous component-based applications such as [[API]]-driven applications, [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based applications and [[service-oriented architecture]]s.
It is used to provide [[software development]] and [[Software quality assurance|QA/testing]] teams access to dependent system components that are needed to exercise an application under test (AUT), but are unavailable or difficult-to-access for development and testing purposes. With the behavior of the dependent components "virtualized", testing and development can proceed without accessing the actual live components.
Service virtualization is recognized by vendors, industry analysts, and industry publications as being different than mocking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoq.com/news/2013/04/Service-Virtualization Service Virtualization as an Alternative to Mocking], by Jonathan Allen, eBizQ April 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=searchsoa&gt;[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/2240150279/Service-virtualization-arises-to-meet-services-testing-obstacles Service virtualization arises to meet services testing obstacles], by George Lawton, SearchSOA May 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Service virtualization emulates the behavior of software components to remove dependency constraints on development and testing teams. Such constraints occur in complex, interdependent environments when a component connected to the application under test is:
* Not yet completed
* Still evolving
* Controlled by a third-party or partner
* Available for testing only in limited capacity or at inconvenient times
* Difficult to provision or configure in a test environment
* Needed for simultaneous access by different teams with varied test data setup and other  requirements
* Restricted or costly to use for load and performance testing &lt;ref name="virtual-strategy.com"&gt;[http://www.virtual-strategy.com/2010/11/28/service-virtualization-modern-applications Service Virtualization for Modern Applications] by Gaurish Hattangadi, Virtual Strategy Magazine, November 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term "service virtualization" reflects the technique's initial focus on virtualizing [[web service]]s, service virtualization extends across all aspects of composite applications: services, [[database]]s, [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]], [[Enterprise service bus|ESBs]], and other components that communicate using common messaging protocols.&lt;ref name="testenvsyscon"&gt;[http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/2112838  Managing Test Environments] by Liz McMillan, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abvsyscon"&gt;[http://cloudcomputing.sys-con.com/node/2110733 Application Behavior Virtualization] by Elizabeth White, Cloud Computing Journal, December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stpdbvirt"&gt;[http://www.softwaretestpro.com/Item/5463/Database-Virtualization-For-Development-and-Test/STQA-Magazine-Development Database Virtualization For Development and Test] by Wayne Ariola, ST &amp; QA Magazine, March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Other similar tools are called [[Application programming interface|API]] simulators, API mocking tools, over the wire [[Test Double|test doubles]].

Service virtualization emulates only the behavior of the specific dependent components that developers or testers need to exercise in order to complete their end-to-end transactions. 
Rather than virtualizing entire systems, it virtualizes only specific slices of dependent behavior critical to the execution of development and testing tasks. This provides just enough application logic so that the developers or testers get what they need without having to wait for the actual service to be completed and readily available. For instance, instead of virtualizing an entire database (and performing all associated test data management as well as setting up the database for every test session), you monitor how the application interacts with the database, then you emulate the related database behavior (the [[SQL]] queries that are passed to the database, the corresponding result sets that are returned, and so forth).&lt;ref name="webservices"&gt;[http://www.webservices.org/index.php/weblog/john_michelsen/an_intro_to_soa_and_virtualization An Intro to SOA and Virtualization] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122114856/http://webservices.org/index.php/weblog/john_michelsen/an_intro_to_soa_and_virtualization |date=2011-11-22 }} by John Michelsen, WebServices.org, August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="abv"&gt;[http://virtualization.sys-con.com/node/1905782 The Next Generation of Test Environment Management] by Wayne Ariola, Virtualization Journal, July 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Service virtualization involves creating and deploying a "virtual asset" that simulates the behavior of a real component which is required to exercise the application under test, but is difficult or impossible to access for development and testing purposes.

A virtual asset stands in for a dependent component by listening for requests and returning an appropriate response—with the appropriate performance. For a database, this might involve listening for a SQL statement, then returning data source rows. For a web service, this might involve listening for an [[XML]] message over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[Java Message Service|JMS]], or [[IBM WebSphere MQ|MQ]], then returning another XML message. The virtual asset's functionality and performance might reflect the actual functionality/performance of the dependent component, or it might simulate exceptional conditions (such as extreme loads or error conditions) to determine how the application under test responds under those circumstances.

Virtual assets are typically created by:
* Recording live communication among components as the system is exercised from the application under test (AUT)
* Providing logs representing historical communication among components
* Analyzing service interface specifications (such as a [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]])
* Defining the behavior manually with various interface controls and data source values

They are then further configured to represent specific data, functionality, and response times.

Virtual assets are deployed locally or in the cloud (public or private). With development/test environments configured to use the virtual assets in place of dependent components, developers or testers can then exercise the application they are working on without having to wait for the dependent components to be completed or readily accessible.&lt;ref name="testenvsyscon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abvsyscon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="abv"/&gt;

Industry analysts report that service virtualization is best suited for "IT shops with significant experience with 'skipping' integration testing due to 'dependent software', and with a reasonably sophisticated test harness.&lt;ref name="kernochan"&gt;[http://waynekernochanblog.blogspot.com/2013/02/parasoft-and-service-virtualization.html  Parasoft and "Service Virtualization" Testing: A Good Idea] by  Wayne Kernochan, Thoughts From a Software IT Analyst, February 22, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to stubbing and mocking==
An alternative approach to working around the test environment access constraints outlined in this article's introduction is for team members to develop [[method stub]]s or [[mock object]]s that substitute for dependent resources. The shortcoming of this approach became apparent in the early 2000s with the rise of [[Service-oriented architecture]].&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/10tr011.pdf Testing in Service-Oriented Environments] by Ed Morris et al, Software Engineering Institute, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of [[Composite applications]] that rely on numerous dependent services, plus the rise of [[Agile software development]] following the 2001 publication of the Agile Manifesto, made it increasingly difficult for developers or testers to manually develop the number, scope, and complexity of stubs or mocks required to complete development and testing tasks for modern enterprise application development.&lt;ref name="ovum"&gt;[http://www.ovum.com/service-virtualization-is-helping-organizations-realize-business-value-from-testing/ Service virtualization is helping organizations realize business value from testing] by Chandranshu Singh, ovum, March 31, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first step in the evolution from stubbing to service virtualization was the technology packaged in SOA testing tools since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/id=356258 Parasoft's Web Service Testing Tool Should Aid Development] by Theresa Lanowitz [http://www.gartner.com Gartner], May 1, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;   The earliest implementations of service virtualization were designed to automate the process of developing simple stub-like emulations so that composite applications could be tested more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/news/1283954/SOA-virtualization-gets-real SOA virtualization gets real] by Rich Seeley, SearchSOA, November 28, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As enterprise systems continued to grow increasingly complex and distributed, software tool vendors shifted focus from stubbing to the more environment-focused service virtualization.&lt;ref name="virtual-strategy.com"/&gt; While stubbing can still be completed through manual development and management of stubs, what has become known as "service virtualization" is completed by using one of the available [[Commercial off-the-shelf|commercial off the shelf (COTS)]] service virtualization technologies as a platform for the development and deployment of their "service virtualization assets".&lt;ref name="ovum"/&gt;

==Agile and DevOps==
The increasing popularity&lt;ref&gt;[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=devops,agile Agile &amp; DevOps Google Trends]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Agile software development]] and [[DevOps]] has created demand for a new set of tools to deliver service virtualization to communities that work in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dzone.com/articles/the-future-of-service-virtualization-and-api-mocki Next Gen Service Virtualization Forum, 13th of September 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; Practices such as [[Continuous delivery]] and moving away from [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] and [[Monolithic application|monolith]] development to more distributed [[Microservices|microservice]]-based architectures fit well with the capabilities of service virtualization. Agile and DevOps teams prefer to work with lightweight tools that have less accumulated bloat and no cumbersome licensing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/platforms/big-enterprise-solutions Thought Works Technology Radar: Big enterprise solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4696">Recent innovations in [[mobile technology|mobile]] and [[sensor]] technologies allow for creating a digital representation of almost any physical entity and its parameters over time at any place. [[RFID]] technologies, for instance, are used to ground digital representations, which are used to track and geo-reference physical entities. In general, physical worlds and digital representations become tightly interconnected, so that manipulations in either would have effect on the other.

Integration of information and communication technologies into products anywhere and anytime enable new forms of [[mobile marketing]] in respect to situated marketing communication, dynamic [[pricing]] models and dynamic [[product differentiation]] models. As Fano and Gershman state: "Technology enables service providers to make the location of their customers the location of their business".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fano, A.E.|author2=Gershman, A.|year=2002|title=The future of business services in the age of ubiquitous computing|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=45|issue=12|pp= 83–87|doi=10.1145/585597.585620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Smart products''' are specializations of hybrid products with physical realizations of product categories and digital product descriptions that provide the following characteristics:
* [[Situated]]: recognition and processing of situational and community contexts
* [[Personalized]]: tailoring to buyer's and consumer's needs and affects
* Adaptive: change according to buyer's and consumer's responses and tasks
* Pro-active: attempt to anticipate buyer's and consumer's plans and [[intention]]s
* Business aware: considering business and legal constraints
* Location aware: considering functional performing and restricted location choice
* Network capable: ability to communicate and bundle ([[product bundling]]) with another [[product (business)]] or product sets

The vision of smart products poses questions relevant to various research areas, including [[marketing]], [[product engineering]], [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[economics]], [[communication science]], [[media economics]], [[cognitive science]], [[consumer psychology]], [[innovation management]] and many more.

Since smart products combine a physical product with additional services, they are a form of [[product service system]].

'''Soil contamination''' or '''soil pollution''' as part of [[land degradation]] is caused by the presence of [[xenobiotic]] (human-made) chemicals or other alteration in the natural soil environment.  It is typically caused by industrial activity, agricultural chemicals, or improper disposal of [[waste]]. The most common chemicals involved are [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbons]], [[polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons]] (such as naphthalene and [[benzo(a)pyrene]]), [[solvents]], pesticides, [[lead]], and other [[heavy metals]]. Contamination is correlated with the degree of [[industrialization]] and intensity of chemical substance. 
The concern over soil contamination stems primarily from health risks, from direct contact with the contaminated soil, vapors from the contaminants, and from secondary contamination of water supplies within and underlying the soil.&lt;ref&gt;''Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund, Human Health Evaluation Manual'', Office of Emergency and Remedial Response, U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], Washington D.C. 20450&lt;/ref&gt; Mapping of contaminated soil sites and the resulting cleanups are time consuming and expensive tasks, requiring extensive amounts of [[geology]], [[hydrology]], [[chemistry]], [[computer modeling]] skills, and [[GIS in Environmental Contamination]], as well as an appreciation of the history of industrial chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=George|first1=Rebecca|last2=Joy|first2=Varsha|last3=S|first3=Aiswarya|last4=Jacob|first4=Priya A|title=Treatment Methods for Contaminated Soils – Translating Science into Practice|url=http://ijear.org/vol4.1/rebecca.pdf|website=International Journal of Education and Applied Research|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]] the extent of [[contaminated land]] is best known, with many of countries in these areas having a legal framework to identify and deal with this environmental problem.  Developing countries tend to be less tightly regulated despite some of them having undergone significant [[Industrialisation|industrialization]].

== Causes ==
Soil pollution can be caused by the following (non-exhaustive list)
* [[Oil spill|Oil spills]]
* [[Mining]] and activities by other heavy industries
* Accidental spills as may happen during activities, etc.
* Corrosion of [[underground storage tank]]s (including piping used to transmit the contents)
* [[Acid rain]]
* [[Intensive farming]]
* [[Agrochemicals]], such as [[pesticide]]s, [[herbicides]] and [[fertilizer]]s
* [[Industrial accident]]s
* [[Road debris]]
* Drainage of contaminated [[surface water]] into the soil
* [[Ammunition]]s, [[Chemical weapon|chemical agents]], and other [[agents of war]]
* [[Waste]] disposal
** Oil and fuel dumping
** [[Nuclear waste]]s
** Direct discharge of [[industrial waste]]s to the soil
** Discharge of [[sewage]] 
** [[Landfill]] and [[illegal dumping]]
** [[Fly ash|Coal ash]]
** [[Electronic waste]]
The most common chemicals involved are [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbons]], [[solvents]], pesticides, [[lead]], and other [[heavy metals]].

Any activity that leads to other forms of [[soil degradation]] ([[erosion]], [[soil compaction|compaction]], etc.) may indirectly worsen the contamination effects in that [[soil remediation]] becomes more tedious.

Historical deposition of [[coal ash]] used for residential, commercial, and industrial heating, as well as for industrial processes such as [[ore smelting]], were a common source of contamination in areas that were [[industrialization|industrialized]] before about 1960. Coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation, as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree. When the coal is burned, most of these metals become concentrated in the ash (the principal exception being mercury). Coal ash and [[slag]] may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a "characteristic [[hazardous waste]]", defined in the USA as containing more than 5&amp;nbsp;mg/l of extractable lead using the [[TCLP]] procedure. In addition to lead, coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of [[polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs; e.g., benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(cd)pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and others). These PAHs are known human [[carcinogen]]s and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around 1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off-white grains in soil, gray heterogeneous soil, or (coal slag) bubbly, vesicular pebble-sized grains.

Treated [[sewage sludge]], known in the industry as [[biosolids]], has become controversial as a "[[fertilizer]]". As it is the byproduct of sewage treatment, it generally contains more contaminants such as organisms, pesticides, and heavy metals than other soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Snyder C |title=The dirty work of promoting "recycling" of America's sewage sludge |journal=Int J Occup Environ Health |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=415–27 |year=2005 |pmid=16350476 |doi= 10.1179/oeh.2005.11.4.415|url=}}[http://www.ijoeh.com/index.php/ijoeh/article/view/278 Free full-text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713005441/http://www.ijoeh.com/index.php/ijoeh/article/view/278 |date=2011-07-13 }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, the [[Water supply and sanitation in the European Union|Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive]] allows sewage sludge to be sprayed onto land. The volume is expected to double to 185,000 tons of dry solids in 2005. This has good agricultural properties due to the high [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphate]] content. In 1990/1991, 13% wet weight was sprayed onto 0.13% of the land; however, this is expected to rise 15 fold by 2005.{{Update inline|date=September 2012}}  Advocates{{who|date=September 2012}} say there is a need to control this so that [[pathogenic]] [[microorganism]]s do not get into water courses and to ensure that there is no accumulation of [[heavy metals]] in the top soil.&lt;ref&gt;R. Olawoyin, S. A. Oyewole, R. L. Grayson, (2012). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2012.08.004 Potential risk effect from elevated levels of soil heavy metals on human health in the Niger delta], Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf., Volume 85, 1 November 2012, Pages 120–130&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticides and herbicides===

A [[pesticide]] is a substance or mixture of substances used to kill a pest. A pesticide may be a chemical substance, biological agent (such as a virus or bacteria), antimicrobial, disinfectant or device used against any pest. Pests include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, mollusks, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms) and microbes that compete with humans for food, destroy property, spread or are a vector for disease or cause a nuisance. Although there are benefits to the use of pesticides, there are also drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other organisms. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Herbicide]]s are used to kill weeds, especially on pavements and railways. They are similar to auxins and most are biodegradable by soil bacteria. However, one group derived from [[trinitrotoluene]] (2:4 D and 2:4:5 T) have the impurity dioxin, which is very toxic and causes fatality even in low concentrations. Another herbicide is [[Paraquat]]. It is highly toxic but it rapidly degrades in soil due to the action of bacteria and does not kill soil fauna.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Insecticides are used to rid farms of pests which damage crops. The insects damage not only standing crops but also stored ones and in the tropics it is reckoned that one third of the total production is lost during food storage. As with [[fungicide]]s, the first insecticides used in the nineteenth century were inorganic e.g. [[Paris Green]] and other compounds of [[arsenic]]. Nicotine has also been used since the late eighteenth century. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

There are now two main groups of synthetic insecticides –

1. [[Organochlorines]] include [[DDT]], [[Aldrin]], [[Dieldrin]] and BHC. They are cheap to produce, potent and persistent. DDT was used on a massive scale from the 1930s, with a peak of 72,000 tonnes used 1970. Then usage fell as the harmful environmental effects were realized. It was found worldwide in fish and birds and was even discovered in the snow in the [[Antarctic]]. It is only slightly soluble in water but is very soluble in the bloodstream. It affects the nervous and endocrine systems and causes the eggshells of birds to lack calcium causing them to be  easily breakable. It is thought to be responsible for the decline of the numbers of birds of prey like [[osprey]]s and [[peregrine falcon]]s in the 1950s – they are now recovering. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}} As well as increased concentration via the food chain, it is known to enter via permeable membranes, so fish get it through their gills. As it has low water solubility, it tends to stay at the water surface, so organisms that live there are most affected. DDT found in fish that formed part of the human food chain caused concern, but the levels found in the liver, kidney and brain tissues was less than 1 ppm and in fat was 10 ppm, which was below the level likely to cause harm. However, DDT was banned in the UK and the United States to stop the further buildup of it in the food chain. U.S. manufacturers continued to sell DDT to developing countries, who could not afford the expensive replacement chemicals and who did not have such stringent regulations governing the use of pesticides.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}.

2. [[Organophosphate]]s, e.g. [[parathion]], methyl parathion and about 40 other insecticides are available nationally. Parathion is highly toxic, methyl-parathion is less so and [[Malathion]] is generally considered safe as it has low toxicity and is rapidly broken down in the mammalian liver. This group works by preventing normal nerve transmission as cholinesterase is prevented from breaking down the transmitter substance acetylcholine, resulting in uncontrolled muscle movements.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Agents of war ===
The disposal of munitions, and a lack of care in manufacture of munitions caused by the urgency of production, can contaminate soil for extended periods. There is little published evidence on this type of contamination largely because of restrictions placed by governments of many countries on the publication of material related to war effort. However, [[mustard gas]] stored during World War II has contaminated some sites for up to 50 years&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/sixty-secret-mustard-gas-sites-uncovered-1335343.html – Six Mustard gas sites uncovered – The Independent]&lt;/ref&gt; and the testing of [[Anthrax]] as a potential [[biological weapon]] contaminated the whole island of [[Gruinard Island|Gruinard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1457035.stm  Britain's Anthrax Island – BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

Contaminated or polluted soil directly affects human health through direct contact with soil or via inhalation of soil contaminants which have vaporized; potentially greater threats are posed by the infiltration of soil contamination into groundwater [[aquifers]] used for human consumption, sometimes in areas apparently far removed from any apparent source of above ground contamination. This tends to result in the development of [List of pollution-related diseases|pollution-related diseases]

Health consequences from exposure to soil contamination vary greatly depending on pollutant type, pathway of attack and vulnerability of the exposed population. Chronic exposure to [[chromium]], [[lead]] and other metals, petroleum, solvents, and many pesticide and herbicide formulations can be carcinogenic, can cause [[congenital disorders]], or can cause other chronic health conditions.  Industrial or man-made concentrations of naturally occurring substances, such as [[nitrate]] and [[ammonia]] associated with livestock manure from agricultural operations, have also been identified as health hazards in soil and groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;http://yosemite.epa.gov/water/owrcCatalog.nsf/065ca07e299b464685256ce50075c11a/383316fae0e9065285256cfd0048e1d2!OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronic exposure to benzene at sufficient concentrations is known to be associated with higher incidence of leukemia. Mercury and [[cyclodiene]]s are known to induce higher incidences of kidney damage and some irreversible diseases. PCBs and cyclodienes are linked to liver toxicity. [[Organophosphate]]s and [[carbonate]]s can induce a chain of responses leading to [[Neuromuscular blockade|neuromuscular blockage]]. Many chlorinated solvents induce liver changes, kidney changes and depression of the central nervous system. There is an entire spectrum of further health effects such as headache, nausea, fatigue, eye irritation and skin rash for the above cited and other chemicals. At sufficient dosages a large number of soil contaminants can cause death by exposure via direct contact, inhalation or ingestion of contaminants in [[groundwater contamination|groundwater contaminated]] through soil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heltheffects.com.net/article/show/single/en/724-Facing-up-to-invisible-pollution- Article on soil contamination in China]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Government]] has commissioned the [[Institute of Occupational Medicine]] to undertake a review of methods to assess risk to human health from contaminated land. The overall aim of the project is to work up guidance that should be useful to Scottish Local Authorities in assessing whether sites represent a significant possibility of significant harm (SPOSH) to human health. It is envisaged that the output of the project will be a short document providing high level guidance on health risk assessment with reference to existing published guidance and methodologies that have been identified as being particularly relevant and helpful. The project will examine how policy guidelines have been developed for determining the acceptability of risks to human health and propose an approach for assessing what constitutes unacceptable risk in line with the criteria for SPOSH as defined in the legislation and the Scottish Statutory Guidance.

==Ecosystem effects==
Not unexpectedly, soil contaminants can have significant deleterious consequences for ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw and Harry Seidman ''[[Computer model]]ng of pesticide transport in soil for five instrumented watersheds'', prepared for the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] Southeast Water laboratory, Athens, Ga. by ESL Inc., Sunnyvale, California (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; There are radical soil chemistry changes which can arise from the presence of many hazardous chemicals even at low concentration of the contaminant species. These changes can manifest in the alteration of [[metabolism]] of endemic [[microorganism]]s and [[arthropod]]s resident in a given soil environment. The result can be virtual eradication of some of the primary food chain, which in turn could have major consequences for [[predator]] or consumer species. Even if the chemical effect on lower life forms is small, the lower pyramid levels of the [[food chain]] may ingest alien chemicals, which normally become more concentrated for each consuming rung of the food chain. Many of these effects are now well known, such as the concentration of persistent DDT materials for avian consumers, leading to weakening of egg shells, increased chick [[death|mortality]] and potential extinction of species.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Effects occur to [[agricultural]] lands which have certain types of soil contamination.  Contaminants typically alter plant metabolism, often causing a reduction in crop yields.  This has a secondary effect upon [[soil conservation]], since the languishing crops cannot shield the Earth's soil from [[erosion]]. Some of these chemical contaminants have long [[half-life|half-lives]] and in other cases derivative chemicals are formed from decay of primary soil contaminants.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Cleanup options==

Cleanup or [[environmental remediation]] is analyzed by [[environmental scientist]]s who utilize field measurement of [[soil chemistry|soil chemicals]] and also apply [[computer model]]s ([[GIS in Environmental Contamination]]) for analyzing transport&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Gupta, C.T. Kincaid, P.R. Mayer, C.A. Newbill and C.R. Cole, "A multidimensional finite element code for the analysis of coupled fluid, energy and solute transport", [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] Pacific Northwest Laboratory PNL-2939, EPA contract 68-03-3116 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and fate of soil chemicals. Various technologies have been developed for remediation of oil-contaminated soil and sediments &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Agarwal | first1 = A. | last2 = Liu | first2 = Y. | year = 2015 | title = Remediation technologies for oil-contaminated sediments | url = | journal = Marine Pollution Bulletin | volume = | issue = | page = | doi = 10.1016/j.marpolbul.2015.09.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several principal strategies for remediation:
* Excavate soil and take it to a disposal site away from ready pathways for human or sensitive ecosystem contact.  This technique also applies to dredging of [[bay mud]]s containing toxins.

Various national standards for concentrations of particular contaminants include the United States EPA Region 9 Preliminary Remediation Goals (U.S. PRGs), the U.S. EPA Region 3 Risk Based Concentrations (U.S. EPA RBCs) and National Environment Protection Council of Australia Guideline on Investigation Levels in Soil and Groundwater.

===People's Republic of China===

The immense and sustained growth of the [[People's Republic of China]] since the 1970s has exacted a price from the land in increased soil pollution. The [[State Environmental Protection Administration]] believes it to be a threat to the environment, to food safety and to sustainable agriculture. According to a scientific sampling, 150 million [[Mu (unit)|mu]] (100,000 square kilometres) of China’s cultivated land have been polluted, with [[water pollution in China|contaminated water]] being used to irrigate a further 32.5 million mu (21,670 square kilometres) and another 2 million mu (1,300 square kilometres) covered or destroyed by solid waste. In total, the area accounts for one-tenth of China’s cultivatable land, and is mostly in economically developed areas. An estimated 12 million tonnes of grain are contaminated by heavy metals every year, causing direct losses of 20 billion [[Yuan (currency)|yuan]] ($2.57 billion [[United States dollar|USD]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/724-Facing-up-to-invisible-pollution- Facing up to "invisible pollution"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''European Union''' ===
According to the received data from Member states, in the European Union the number of estimated potential contaminated sites is more than 2.5 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Liedekerke|first2=Marc Van|last3=Yigini|first3=Yusuf|last4=Montanarella|first4=Luca|date=2013|title=Contaminated Sites in Europe: Review of the Current Situation Based on Data Collected through a European Network|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/158764|journal=Journal of Environmental and Public Health|language=en|volume=2013|pages=1–11|doi=10.1155/2013/158764|issn=1687-9805}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the identified contaminated sites around 342 thousand. Municipal and industrial wastes contribute most to soil contamination (38%), followed by the industrial/commercial sector (34%). Mineral oil and heavy metals are the main contaminants contributing around 60% to soil contamination. In terms of budget, the management of contaminated sites is estimated to cost around 6 billion [[Euro|Euros]] (€) annually&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panagos|first=Panos|last2=Liedekerke|first2=Marc Van|last3=Yigini|first3=Yusuf|last4=Montanarella|first4=Luca|date=2013|title=Contaminated Sites in Europe: Review of the Current Situation Based on Data Collected through a European Network|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/158764|journal=Journal of Environmental and Public Health|language=en|volume=2013|pages=1–11|doi=10.1155/2013/158764|issn=1687-9805}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===United Kingdom===

Generic guidance commonly used in the [[United Kingdom]] are the Soil Guideline Values published by the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) and the [[Environment Agency]]. These are screening values that demonstrate the minimal acceptable level of a substance. Above this there can be no assurances in terms of significant risk of harm to human health. These have been derived using the Contaminated Land Exposure Assessment Model (CLEA UK). Certain input parameters such as Health Criteria Values, age and land use are fed into CLEA UK to obtain a probabilistic output{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.

Guidance by the Inter Departmental Committee for the Redevelopment of Contaminated Land (ICRCL)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contaminatedland.co.uk/std-guid/icrcl-l.htm&lt;/ref&gt; has been formally withdrawn by [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|DEFRA]], for use as a prescriptive document to determine the potential need for remediation or further assessment.

The CLEA model published by DEFRA and the [[Environment Agency]] (EA) in March 2002 sets a framework for the appropriate assessment of risks to human health from contaminated land, as required by Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. As part of this framework, generic [[Soil Guideline Values (SGVs)]] have currently been derived for ten contaminants to be used as "intervention values"{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. These values should not be considered as remedial targets but values above which further detailed assessment should be considered; see [[Dutch pollutant standards|Dutch standards]].
 
Three sets of CLEA SGVs have been produced for three different land uses, namely 
* residential (with and without plant uptake)
* allotments
* commercial/industrial

It is intended that the SGVs replace the former ICRCL values. The CLEA SGVs relate to assessing chronic (long term) risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction, or other potential receptors such as groundwater, buildings, plants or other ecosystems.  The CLEA SGVs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding, as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}
 
To date, the first ten of fifty-five contaminant SGVs have been published, for the following: arsenic, [[cadmium]], chromium, lead, inorganic mercury, nickel, selenium ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene.  Draft SGVs for benzene, naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold.  Toxicological data (Tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzo[a]pyrene, benzene, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, naphthalene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, tetrachloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene and xylene.  The SGVs for ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene are dependent on the soil organic matter (SOM) content (which can be calculated from the total organic carbon (TOC) content).  As an initial screen the SGVs for 1% SOM are considered to be appropriate.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

In March 2009, the issue of [[Uranium poisoning in Punjab]] attracted press coverage. It was alleged to be caused by [[fly ash]] ponds of [[thermal power]] stations, which reportedly lead to severe birth defects in children in the [[Faridkot district|Faridkot]] and [[Bhatinda]] districts of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].

Scientific studies, based on over 1000 samples from various sampling points, could not trace the source to fly ash and any sources from thermal power plants or industry as originally alleged. The study also revealed that the uranium concentration in ground water of Malwa district is not 60 times the WHO limits, but only 50% above the WHO limit in 3 locations. This highest concentration found in samples was less than those found naturally in ground waters currently used for human purposes elsewhere, such as [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dae.nic.in/writereaddata/lsus3346.pdf Atomic Energy Report – Malwa Punjab Uranium Q&amp;A] Lok Sabha, Government of India (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Research is underway to identify natural or other sources for the uranium.

In [[computer science]], [[computer engineering]] and [[programming language implementation]]s, a '''stack machine''' is a type of computer.  In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine. The main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a [[stack (data structure)|pushdown stack]] of numbers rather than numbers in [[Processor registers|registers]].  A stack computer is programmed with a [[reverse Polish notation]] [[instruction set]]. Most computer systems implement a stack in some form to pass parameters and link to subroutines.  This does not make these computers stack machines.

The common alternatives to stack machines are [[register machine]]s, in which each instruction explicitly names specific registers for its operands and result.

==Practical expression-stack machines==
A "stack machine" is a computer that uses a last-in, first-out [[stack (data structure)|stack]] to hold short-lived temporary values. Most of its instructions assume that operands will be from the stack, and results placed in the stack.

For a typical instruction such as {{code|Add}} the computer takes both operands from the topmost (most recent) values of the stack. The computer replaces those two values with the sum, which the computer calculates when it performs the {{code|Add}} instruction.  The instruction's operands are "popped" off the stack, and its result(s) are then "pushed" back onto the stack, ready for the next instruction.   Most stack instructions have only an [[opcode]] commanding an operation, with no additional fields to identify a constant, register or memory cell.  The stack easily holds more than two inputs or more than one result, so a richer set of operations can be computed.  Integer constant operands are often pushed by separate {{code|Load Immediate}} instructions.  Memory is often accessed by separate {{code|Load}} or {{code|Store}} instructions containing a memory address or calculating the address from values in the stack.

For speed, a stack machine often implements some part of its stack with registers. To execute quickly, operands of the [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU) may be the top two registers of the stack and the result from the ALU is stored in the top register of the stack.  Some stack machines have a stack of limited size, implemented as a register file. The ALU will access this with an index. Some machines have a stack of unlimited size, implemented as an array in RAM accessed by a "top of stack" address register. This is slower, but the number of flip-flops is less, making a less-expensive, more compact CPU.  Its topmost N values may be [[Cache (computing)|cached]] for speed. A few machines have both an expression stack in memory and a separate register stack. In this case, software, or an interrupt may move data between them.

The [[instruction set]] carries out most ALU actions with postfix ([[reverse Polish notation]]) operations that work only on the expression stack, not on data registers or main memory cells. This can be very convenient for executing high-level languages, because most arithmetic expressions can be easily translated into postfix notation.

In contrast, [[register machine]]s hold temporary values in a small, fast array of [[Processor register|register]]s.  [[Accumulator machine]]s have only one general-purpose register.  [[Belt machine]]s use a FIFO queue to hold temporary values.  Memory-to-memory machines do not have any temporary registers usable by a programmer.

Stack machines may have their expression stack and their [[call stack|call-return stack]] separated or as one integrated structure. If they are separated, the instructions of the stack machine can be [[instruction pipelining|pipelined]] with fewer interactions and less design complexity. Usually it can run faster.

Some technical handheld calculators use reverse Polish notation in their keyboard interface, instead of having parenthesis keys.  This is a form of stack machine.  The Plus key relies on its two operands already being at the correct topmost positions of the user-visible stack.

===Advantages of stack machine instruction sets===
====Very compact object code====
Stack machines have much smaller instructions than the other styles of machines.   Loads and stores to memory are separate and so stack code requires roughly twice as many instructions as the equivalent code for register machines.  The total code size (in bytes) is still less for stack machines.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In stack machine code, the most frequent instructions consist of just an opcode selecting the operation.  This can easily fit in 6 bits or less.  Branches, load immediates, and load/store instructions require an argument field, but stack machines often arrange that the frequent cases of these still fit together with the opcode into a compact group of bits.  The selection of operands from prior results is done implicitly by ordering the instructions.  In contrast, register machines require two or three register-number fields per ALU instruction to select operands; the densest register machines average about 16 bits per instruction.

The instructions for accumulator or memory-to-memory machines are not padded out with multiple register fields.  Instead, they use compiler-managed anonymous variables for subexpression values.  These temporary locations require extra memory reference instructions which take more code space than for the stack machine, or even compact register machines.

All practical stack machines have variants of the load–store opcodes for accessing [[local variable]]s and [[formal parameter]]s without explicit address calculations.  This can be by offsets from the current top-of-stack address, or by offsets from a stable frame-base register.  Register machines handle this with a register+offset address mode, but use a wider offset field.

[[Instruction set#Code density|Dense machine code]] was very valuable in the 1960s, when main memory was very expensive and very limited even on mainframes. It became important again on the initially-tiny memories of minicomputers and then microprocessors. Density remains important today, for smartphone applications, applications downloaded into browsers over slow Internet connections, and in ROMs for embedded applications. A more general advantage of increased density is improved effectiveness of caches and instruction prefetch.

Some of the density of [[Burroughs large systems#B6500|Burroughs B6700]] code was due to moving vital operand information elsewhere, to 'tags' on every data word or into tables of pointers.  The Add instruction itself was generic or polymorphic.  It had to fetch the operand to discover whether this was an integer add or floating point add.  The Load instruction could find itself tripping on an [[Addressing mode|indirect address]], or worse, a disguised call to a [[call-by-name]] [[thunk]] routine.  The generic opcodes required fewer opcode bits but made the hardware more like an interpreter, with less opportunity to pipeline the common cases.

====Simple compilers====
Compilers for stack machines are simpler and quicker to build than compilers for other machines.  Code generation is trivial and independent of prior or subsequent code. For example, given an expression x+y*z+u, the corresponding syntax tree would be:

[[File:Binary tree - stack.png|thumb|none|Binary tree - stack]]

The compiled code for a simple stack machine would take the form:

  push x
  push y
  push z
  multiply
  add
  push u
  add

Note that the arithmetic operations 'multiply' and 'add' act on the two topmost operands of the stack.

Such simple compilation can be done by the parsing pass.  No register management is needed. Most stack machines can copy stack entries to avoid memory access (which is much slower), but these are usually trivial.  The same opcode that handles the frequent common case of an add, an indexed load, or a function call will also handle the general case involving complex subexpressions and nested calls. The compiler and the CPU do not need special cases for instructions that have separate calculation paths for addresses.

This simplicity has allowed compilers to fit onto very small machines.  The simple compilers allowed new product lines to get to market quickly, and allowed new operating systems to be written entirely in a high level language rather than in assembly.  For example, the [[UCSD Pascal|UCSD p-System]] supported a complete student programming environment on early 8-bit microprocessors with poor instruction sets and little RAM, by compiling to a virtual stack machine rather than to the actual hardware.

The downside to the simplicity of compilers for stack machines, is that pure stack machines have fewer optimisations (see subsections in [[#Performance disadvantages of stack machines|§ performance disadvantages of stack machines]]). However optimisation of compiled stack code is quite possible. Back-end optimisation of compiler output has been demonstrated to significantly improve code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koopman|first=Philip|title=A Preliminary Exploration of Optimized Stack Code Generation|journal=Journal of Forth applications and Research|year=1994|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_compiler/stack_co.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Chris|title=Inter-Boundary Scheduling of Stack Operands: A preliminary Study|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth 2000 Conference|year=2000|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth/ef00/bailey00.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and potentially performance, whilst global optimisation within the compiler itself achieves further gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Mark|author2=Bailey C |title=Global Stack Allocation : Register Allocation for Stack Machines|journal=Proceedings of Euroforth Conference 2006|year=2006|url=http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/euroforth2006/papers/shannon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Simple interpreters====
Some stack machine instruction sets are intended for interpretive execution of a virtual machine, rather than driving hardware directly.  Interpreters for virtual stack machines are easier to build than interpreters for register or memory-to-memory machines; the logic for handling memory address modes is in just one place rather than repeated in many instructions.  Stack machines also tend to have fewer variations of an opcode; one generalized opcode will handle both frequent cases and obscure corner cases of memory references or function call setup.  (But code density is often improved by adding short and long forms for the same operation.)

====Fast operand access====
Since there are no operand fields to decode, stack machines fetch each instruction and its operands at same time. Stack machines can omit the operand fetching stage of a register machine.&lt;ref name="koopman89" /&gt; In addition, except explicit load from memory instructions, the order of operand usage is identical with the order of the operands in the data stack. So excellent prefetching is accomplished easily by keeping operands on the top of stack in fast storage. For example, in the [[Java Optimized Processor]] (JOP) microprocessor the top 2 operands of stack directly enter a data forwarding circuit that is faster than the register file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jopdesign.com/doc/stack.pdf|format=PDF|title=Design and Implementation of an Efficient Stack Machine|website=Jopdesign.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Avoids data passing through memory, faster interpreters=====
Fast access is also useful for interpreters. Most register interpreters specify their registers by number. But a host machine's registers can't be accessed in an indexed array, so a memory array is allotted for virtual registers. Therefore, the instructions of a register interpreter must use memory for passing generated data to the next instruction. This forces register interpreters to be much slower on microprocessors made with a fine process rule (i.e. faster transistors without improving circuit speeds, such as the Haswell x86). These require several clocks for memory access, but only one clock for register access. In the case of a stack machine with a data forwarding circuit instead of a register file, stack interpreters can allot the host machine's registers for the top several operands of the stack instead of the host machine's memory.

====Minimal processor state====
A machine with an expression stack can get by with just two registers that are visible to a programmer: The top-of-stack address and the next-instruction address.  The minimal hardware implementation has far fewer bits of flipflops or registers.  Faster designs can simply buffer the topmost N stack cells into registers to reduce memory stack cycles.

Responding to an interrupt involves saving the registers to a stack, and then branching to the interrupt handler code.  In a stack machine, most parameters are already on a stack.  Therefore, there is no need to push them there.  Often stack machines respond more quickly to interrupts.  Some register machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped&lt;ref&gt;8051 CPU Manual, Intel, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; but this increases costs and slows down the register file.

===Performance disadvantages of stack machines===
====More memory references====
Some in the industry believe that stack machines execute more [[data cache]] cycles for temporary values and local variables than do register machines.&lt;ref&gt;"Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach", John L Hennessy, David A Patterson; See the discussion of stack machines.&lt;/ref&gt;

On stack machines, temporary values often get spilled into memory, whereas on machines with many registers these temps usually remain in registers.  (However, these values often need to be spilled into "activation frames" at the end of a procedure's definition, basic block, or at the very least, into a memory buffer during interrupt processing).  Values spilled to memory add more cache cycles.  This spilling effect depends on the number of hidden registers used to buffer top-of-stack values, upon the frequency of nested procedure calls, and upon host computer interrupt processing rates.

Some simple stack machines or stack interpreters use no top-of-stack hardware registers.  Those minimal implementations are always slower than standard register machines.  A typical expression such as {{code|X+1}} compiles to {{code|Load X}}; {{code|Load 1}}; {{code|Add}}.  This does implicit writes and reads of the memory stack which were not needed:
* Load X, push to memory
* Load 1, push to memory
* Pop 2 values from memory, add, and push result to memory
for a total of 5 data cache references.

The next step up from this is a stack machine or interpreter with a single top-of-stack register.  The above code then does:
* Load X into empty TOS register (if hardware machine), or
* Push TOS register to memory, Load X into TOS register (if interpreter)
* Push TOS register to memory, Load 1 into TOS register
* Pop left operand from memory, add to TOS register and leave it there
for a total of 5 data cache references, worst-case.  Generally, interpreters don't track emptiness, because they don't have to—anything below the stack pointer is a non-empty value, and the TOS cache register is always kept hot.  Typical Java interpreters do not buffer the top-of-stack this way, however, because the program and stack have a mix of short and wide data values.

If the hardwired stack machine has N registers to cache the topmost memory stack words, then all spills and refills are avoided in this example and there is only 1 data cache cycle, the same as for a register or accumulator machine.

On register machines using optimizing compilers, it is very common for the most-used local variables to remain in registers rather than in stack frame memory cells.  This eliminates most data cache cycles for reading and writing those values.  The development of "stack scheduling" for performing live-variable analysis, and thus retaining key variables on the stack for extended periods, helps this concern.

On the other hand, register machines must spill many of their registers to memory across nested procedure calls.  The decision of which registers to spill, and when, is made statically at compile time rather than on the dynamic depth of the calls.  This can lead to more data cache traffic than in an advanced stack machine implementation.

====High cost of factoring out common subexpressions====
In register machines, a [[common subexpression]] (a subexpression which is used multiple times with the same result value) can be evaluated just once and its result saved in a fast register. The subsequent reuses have no time or code cost, just a register reference. This optimization speeds simple expressions (for example, loading variable X or pointer P) as well as less-common complex expressions.

With stack machines, in contrast, results can be stored in one of two ways. Firstly, results can be stored using a temporary variable in memory. Storing and subsequent retrievals cost additional instructions and additional data cache cycles. Doing this is only a win if the subexpression computation costs more in time than fetching from memory, which in most stack CPUs, almost always is the case. It is never worthwhile for simple variables and pointer fetches, because those already have the same cost of one data cache cycle per access. It is only marginally worthwhile for expressions such as {{code|X+1}}. These simpler expressions make up the majority of redundant, optimizable expressions in programs written in non-concatenative languages. An optimizing compiler can only win on redundancies that the programmer could have avoided in the source code.

The second way leaves a computed value on the data stack, duplicating it as needed. This uses operations to copy stack entries. The stack must be depth shallow enough for the CPU's available copy instructions. Hand-written stack code often uses this approach, and achieves speeds like general-purpose register machines.&lt;ref name="koopman89"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/|title=Stack Computers: the new wave -- an on-line book|website=Ece.cmu.edu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fpgacpu.ca/stack/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf|format=PDF|title=Second-Generation Stack Computer Architecture|website=Fpgacpu.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718112702/http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~laforest/Second-Generation_Stack_Computer_Architecture.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, algorithms for optimal "stack scheduling" are not in wide use by programming languages.

====Rigid code order====
In modern machines, the time to fetch a variable from the data cache is often several times longer than the time needed for basic ALU operations.  A program runs faster without stalls if its memory loads can be started several cycles before the instruction that needs that variable.  Complex machines can do this with a deep pipeline and "out-of-order execution" that examines and runs many instructions at once.  Register machines can even do this with much simpler "in-order" hardware, a shallow pipeline, and slightly smarter compilers. The load step becomes a separate instruction, and that instruction is statically scheduled much earlier in the code sequence.  The compiler puts independent steps in between.

Scheduling memory accesses requires explicit, spare registers.  It is not possible on stack machines without exposing some aspect of the micro-architecture to the programmer.  For the expression A-B, the right operand must be evaluated and pushed immediately prior to the Minus step.  Without stack permutation or hardware multithreading, relatively little useful code can be put in between while waiting for the Load B to finish.  Stack machines can work around the memory delay by either having a deep out-of-order execution pipeline covering many instructions at once, or more likely, they can permute the stack such that they can work on other workloads while the load completes, or they can interlace the execution of different program threads, as in the Unisys A9 system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321233311/http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/burroughs/A-Series/1170057_aSeries_Intro_apr86.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Today's increasingly parallel computational loads suggests, however, this might not be the disadvantage it's been made out to be in the past.

=====Able to use out-of-order execution=====
The [[Tomasulo algorithm]] finds [[instruction-level parallelism]] by issuing instructions as their data becomes available.  Conceptually, the addresses of positions in a stack are no different than the register indexes of a register file.  This view permits the [[out-of-order execution]] of the Tomasulo algorithm to be used with stack machines.

Out-of-order execution in stack machines seems to reduce or avoid many theoretical and practical difficulties.&lt;ref name="boost"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chatterji|first1=Satrajit|last2=Ravindran|first2=Kaushik|title=BOOST: Berkeley's Out of Order Stack Thingie|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228556746_BOOST_Berkeley's_Out-of-Order_Stack_Thingy|website=Research Gate|publisher=Kaushik Ravindran|accessdate=16 February 2016|ref=boost}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cited research shows that such a stack machine can exploit instruction-level parallelism, and the resulting hardware must cache data for the instructions. Such machines effectively bypass most memory accesses to the stack.  The result achieves throughput (instructions per [[Clock rate|clock]]) comparable to [[RISC]] register machines, with much higher code densities (because operand addresses are implicit).

A stack machine's compact code naturally fits more instructions in cache, and therefore could achieve better [[CPU cache|cache]] efficiency, reducing memory costs or permitting faster memory systems for a given cost. In addition, most stack-machine instruction is very simple, made from only one opcode field or one operand field. Thus, stack-machines require very little electronic resources to decode each instruction.

One issue brought up in the research was that it takes about 1.88 stack-machine instructions to do the work of a register machine's RISC instruction.
Competitive out-of-order stack machines therefore require about twice as many electronic resources to track instructions ("issue stations"). This might be compensated by savings in instruction cache and memory and instruction decoding circuits.

====Hides a faster register machine inside====
Some simple stack machines have a chip design which is fully customized all the way down to the level of individual registers.  The top of stack address register and the N top of stack data buffers are built from separate individual register circuits, with separate adders and ad hoc connections.

However, most stack machines are built from larger circuit components where the N data buffers are stored together within a register file and share read/write buses.  The decoded stack instructions are mapped into one or more sequential actions on that hidden register file. Loads and ALU ops act on a few topmost registers, and implicit spills and fills act on the bottommost registers. The decoder allows the instruction stream to be compact.  But if the code stream instead had explicit register-select fields which directly manipulated the underlying register file, the compiler could make better use of all registers and the program would run faster.

[[Microcode|Microprogrammed]] stack machines are an example of this.  The inner microcode engine is some kind of RISC-like register machine or a [[VLIW]]-like machine using multiple register files.  When controlled directly by task-specific microcode, that engine gets much more work completed per cycle than when controlled indirectly by equivalent stack code for that same task.

The object code translators for the [[HP 3000]] and [[Tandem Computers|Tandem]] T/16 are another example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=HP3000 Emulation on HP Precision Architecture Computers|author1=Arndt Bergh|author2=Keith Keilman|author3=Daniel Magenheimer|author4=James Miller|journal=Hewlett-Packard Journal|date=December 1987|pages=87-89|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1987-12.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Migrating a CISC Computer Family onto RISC via Object Code Translation, K. Andrews and D. Sand, Proceedings of ASPLOS-V, October, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
They translated stack code sequences into equivalent sequences of RISC code.  Minor 'local' optimizations removed much of the overhead of a stack architecture.  Spare registers were used to factor out repeated address calculations.  The translated code still retained plenty of emulation overhead from the mismatch between original and target machines. Despite that burden, the cycle efficiency of the translated code matched the cycle efficiency of the original stack code.  And when the source code was recompiled directly to the register machine via optimizing compilers, the efficiency doubled.  This shows that the stack architecture and its non-optimizing compilers were wasting over half of the power of the underlying hardware.

Register files are good tools for computing because they have high bandwidth and very low latency, compared to memory references via data caches.  In a simple machine, the register file allows reading two independent registers and writing of a third, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle or less latency.  Whereas the corresponding data cache can start only one read or one write (not both) per cycle, and the read typically has a latency of two ALU cycles.  That's one third of the throughput at twice the pipeline delay.  In a complex machine like [[Athlon]] that completes two or more instructions per cycle, the register file allows reading of four or more independent registers and writing of two others, all in one ALU cycle with one-cycle latency.  Whereas the corresponding dual-ported data cache can start only two reads or writes per cycle, with multiple cycles of latency.  Again, that's one third of the throughput of registers.  It is very expensive to build a cache with additional ports.

====More instructions, slower interpreters====
Interpreters for virtual stack machines are often slower than interpreters for other styles of virtual machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Virtual Machine Showdown: Stack vs. Register Machine"|author1=Yunhe Shi|author2=David Gregg|author3=Andrew Beatty|author4=M. Anton Ertle|url=http://usenix.org/events/vee05/full_papers/p153-yunhe.pdf|format=PDF|website=Usenix.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slowdown is worst when running on host machines with deep execution pipelines, such as current x86 chips.

A program has to execute more instructions when compiled to a stack machine than when compiled to a register machine or memory-to-memory machine.  Every variable load or constant requires its own separate Load instruction, instead of being bundled within the instruction which uses that value.  The separated instructions may be simple and faster running, but the total instruction count is still higher.

In some interpreters, the interpreter must execute a N-way switch jump to decode the next opcode and branch to its steps for that particular opcode. Another method for selecting opcodes is [[threaded code]]. The host machine's prefetch mechanisms are unable to predict and fetch the target of that indexed or indirect jump.  So the host machine's execution pipeline must restart each time the hosted interpreter decodes another virtual instruction.  This happens more often for virtual stack machines than for other styles of virtual machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='The Case for Virtual Register Machines'|author1=Brian Davis|author2=Andrew Beatty|author3=Kevin Casey|author4=David Gregg|author5=John Waldron|url=http://www.scss.tcd.ie/David.Gregg/papers/Gregg-SoCP-2005.pdf|format=PDF|website=Scss.tcd.ie|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Android's [[Dalvik (software)|Dalvik]] virtual machine for Java uses a virtual-register 16-bit instruction set instead of Java's usual 8-bit stack code, to minimize instruction count and opcode dispatch stalls.  Arithmetic instructions directly fetch or store local variables via 4-bit (or larger) instruction fields.  Version 5.0 of Lua replaced its virtual stack machine with a faster virtual register machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lua.org/doc/jucs05.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Implementation of Lua 5.0|website=Lua.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/talks/lua-ll3.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Virtual Machine of Lua 5.0|website=Inf.puc-rio.br|accessdate=8 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Java virtual machine becomes popular, current microprocessors employ advanced [[branch predictor]] for indirect jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01100647/document|title=Branch Prediction and the Performance of Interpreters - Don’t Trust Folklore|website=Hal.inria.fr|accessdate=8 October 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; This advance avoids most of pipeline restarts from N-way jumps, thus almost eliminates instruction count costs which affects rather stack interpreters than register interpreters.

===Hybrid machines===
(These should not be confused with [[hybrid computer]]s that combine both digital and analogue features, e.g. an otherwise digital computer that accesses analogue multiplication or differential equation solving by memory mapping and conversion to and from an analogue device's inputs and outputs.)

Pure stack machines are quite inefficient for procedures which access multiple fields from the same object. The stack machine code must reload the object pointer for each pointer+offset calculation. A common fix for this is to add some register-machine features to the stack machine: a visible register file dedicated to holding addresses, and register-style instructions for doing loads and simple address calculations. It is uncommon to have the registers be fully general purpose, because then there is no strong reason to have an expression stack and postfix instructions.

Another common hybrid is to start with a register machine architecture, and add another memory address mode which emulates the push or pop operations of stack machines: 'memaddress = reg; reg += instr.displ'. This was first used in [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[PDP-11]] minicomputer. This feature was carried forward in [[VAX]] computers and in [[Motorola 6800]] and [[Motorola 68000|M68000]] microprocessors. This allowed the use of simpler stack methods in early compilers. It also efficiently supported virtual machines using stack interpreters or [[threaded code]]. However, this feature did not help the register machine's own code to become as compact as pure stack machine code. Also, the execution speed was less than when compiling well to the register architecture. It is faster to change the top-of-stack pointer only occasionally (once per call or return) rather than constantly stepping it up and down throughout each program statement, and it is even faster to avoid memory references entirely.

More recently, so-called second-generation stack machines have adopted a dedicated collection of registers to serve as address registers, off-loading the task of memory addressing from the data stack. For example, MuP21 relies on a register called "A", while the more recent GreenArrays processors relies on two registers: A and B.

The Intel x86 family of microprocessors have a register-style (accumulator) instruction set for most operations, but use stack instructions for its [[x87]], [[Intel 8087]] floating point arithmetic, dating back to the iAPX87 (8087) coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088. That is, there are no programmer-accessible floating point registers, but only an 80-bit wide, 8 deep stack. The x87 relies heavily on the x86 CPU for assistance in performing its operations.

==Computers using call stacks and stack frames==
Most current computers (of any instruction set style) and most compilers use a large [[call stack|call-return stack]] in memory to organize the short-lived local variables and return links for all currently active procedures or functions.  Each nested call creates a new '''stack frame''' in memory, which persists until that call completes.  This call-return stack may be entirely managed by the hardware via specialized address registers and special address modes in the instructions.  Or it may be merely a set of conventions followed by the compilers, using generic registers and register+offset address modes.  Or it may be something in between.

Since this technique is now nearly universal, even on register machines, it is not helpful to refer to all these machines as stack machines.  That term is commonly reserved for machines which also use an expression stack and stack-only arithmetic instructions to evaluate the pieces of a single statement.

Computers commonly provide direct, efficient access to the program's global variables and to the local variables of only the current innermost procedure or function, the topmost stack frame.  'Up level' addressing of the contents of callers' stack frames is usually not needed and not supported as directly by the hardware.  If needed, compilers support this by passing in frame pointers as additional, hidden parameters.

Some Burroughs stack machines do support up-level refs directly in the hardware, with specialized address modes and a special 'display' register file holding the frame addresses of all outer scopes.  No subsequent computer lines have done this in hardware.  When [[Niklaus Wirth]] developed the first [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] compiler for the [[CDC 6000 series|CDC 6000]], he found that it was faster overall to pass in the frame pointers as a chain, rather than constantly updating complete arrays of frame pointers.  This software method also adds no overhead for common languages like C which lack up-level refs.

The same Burroughs machines also supported nesting of tasks or threads.  The task and its creator share the stack frames that existed at the time of task creation, but not the creator's subsequent frames nor the task's own frames.  This was supported by a [[Parent pointer tree|cactus stack]], whose layout diagram resembled the trunk and arms of a [[Saguaro]] cactus.  Each task had its own memory segment holding its stack and the frames that it owns.  The base of this stack is linked to the middle of its creator's stack.  In machines with a conventional flat address space, the creator stack and task stacks would be separate heap objects in one heap.

In some programming languages, the outer-scope data environments are not always nested in time.  These languages organize their procedure 'activation records' as separate heap objects rather than as stack frames appended to a linear stack.

In simple languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] that lack local variables and naming of parameters, stack frames would contain nothing more than return branch addresses and frame management overhead.  So their return stack holds bare return addresses rather than frames.  The return stack is separate from the data value stack, to improve the flow of call setup and returns.

Later in the 19th century, the order was used in the architecture of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]].

==Composition==
The heaviest orders are at the bottom of a building, whilst the lightest come at the top. This rule means that the [[Doric order]] is a preferred order for the ground floor, the [[Ionic order]] is used for the middle storey, while the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or the [[Composite order]] is used for the top storey. The ground floor may also have [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. Initially, the top story usually featured the Composite order, but, after [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] published his treatise ''L’Idea dell’Architettura Universale'' (''The Idea of a Universal Architecture'') (Venice, 1615), architects switched to the Corinthian order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=СУПЕРПОЗИЦИЯ|url=http://www.rah.ru/science/glossary/detail.php?ID=19529&amp;sphrase_id=26073|website=[[The Russian Academy of Arts ]]|publisher=rah.ru|accessdate=29 August 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superposed order allowed storeys without columns, but rearrangement of order styles was strictly forbidden.

A '''turn construction unit''' (TCU) is the fundamental segment of speech in a conversation, as analyzed in [[conversation analysis]].

The idea was introduced in (Sacks, Schegloff, &amp; Jefferson 1974) and is meant to describe pieces of conversation which may comprise an entire turn. The end of a TCU, called a ''transition relevance place'' (TRP), marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker, or the present speaker may continue with another TCU.

== Turn Construction Unit (TCU) ==
A '''Turn Construction Unit (TCU)''' is a building component of a turn in a conversation. It is a unit of conversation that completes a communicative act.

=== Types of TCU ===

There are four types of TCU categorized by the roles they play in the utterance:

1. '''Lexical TCU''': e.g. "Yes", "There"&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Phrasal TCU''': e.g. "In the basket", "out of here"&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Clausal TCU''': e.g. "When I am free", "If I got the job"&lt;br /&gt;
4. '''Sentential TCU''': e.g. "I am working on my thesis", "He has got my car"

=== Criteria for Turn Construction Unit ===
A general rule to identify a TCU would be to look for a possible completion in an ongoing utterance. There are three criteria to determine what constitutes a TCU:&lt;br /&gt;
1. '''Intonationally Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with the hint of a falling tone, signaling the possible ending of the utterance.&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Grammatically Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with a hint of its syntactic completeness, i.e. it signals the end of a sentence in terms of its grammatical structure.&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Pragmatically Complete''': This means the utterance is seen to have possibly accomplished its purpose in response to the situation during a conversation. For example, the utterance "She is really" can be seen as pragmatically complete in response to the exclamation, "That girl is really pretty!", in the sense that it functions as an agreement to the previous comment.

Scholars in the field of conversation analysis have debated over the relative significance of the above three criteria as signifiers of the end of an utterance. There are, however, no conclusive answer to the discussion, and one can classify a TCU as such when observing either one (or more) of the above features.

== Transition Relevance Place (TRP)==
'''Transition Relevance Place''' (or TRP) is a point of possible completion (or potential end) of an utterance (hence a TCU) where speaker change is a possible next action.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4193">'''Uncertain inference''' was first described by [[C. J. van Rijsbergen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | author=C. J. van Rijsbergen | title=A non-classical logic for information retrieval | publisher=The Computer Journal | pages=481–485 | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a way to formally define a query and document relationship in [[Information retrieval]]. This formalization is a [[logical consequence|logical implication]] with an attached measure of uncertainty.

==Definitions==
Rijsbergen proposes that the measure of [[uncertainty]] of a document ''d'' to a query ''q'' be the probability of its logical implication, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;P(d \to q)&lt;/math&gt;

A user's query can be interpreted as a set of assertions about the desired document. It is the system's task to [[inference|infer]], given a particular document, if the query assertions are true. If they are, the document is retrieved.
In many cases the contents of documents are not sufficient to assert the queries. A [[knowledge base]] of facts and rules is needed, but some of them may be uncertain because there may be a probability associated to using them for inference. Therefore, we can also refer to this as ''plausible inference''. The [[plausibility]] of an inference &lt;math&gt;d \to q&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the plausibility of each query assertion. Rather than retrieving a document that exactly matches the query we should rank the documents based on their plausibility in regards to that query.
Since ''d'' and ''q'' are both generated by users, they are error prone; thus &lt;math&gt;d \to q&lt;/math&gt; is uncertain. This will affect the plausibility of a given query.

By doing this it accomplishes two things:
* Separate the processes of revising probabilities from the logic
* Separate the treatment of relevance from the treatment of requests

[[Multimedia]] documents, like images or videos, have different inference properties for each datatype. They are also different from text document properties. The framework of plausible inference allows us to measure and combine the probabilities coming from these different properties.

Uncertain inference generalizes the notions of [[autoepistemic logic]], where truth values are either known or unknown, and when known, they are true or false.

==Example==
If we have a query of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;q = A \wedge B \wedge C&lt;/math&gt;

where A, B and C are query assertions, then for a document D we want the probability:

:&lt;math&gt;P (D \to (A \wedge B \wedge C))&lt;/math&gt;

If we transform this into the [[conditional probability]] &lt;math&gt;P ((A \wedge B \wedge C) | D)&lt;/math&gt; and if the query assertions are independent we can calculate the overall probability of the implication as the product of the individual assertions probabilities.

==Further work==
Croft and Krovetz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=Interactive retrieval office documents | url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/45410.45435 | author1=W. B. Croft | author2=R. Krovetz | year=1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; applied uncertain inference to an information retrieval system for office documents they called ''OFFICER''. In office documents the independence assumption is valid since the query will focus on their individual attributes. Besides analysing the content of documents one can also query about the author, size, topic or collection for example. They devised methods to compare document and query attributes, infer their plausibility and combine it into an overall rating for each document. Besides that uncertainty of document and query contents also had to be addressed.

[[Probabilistic logic network]]s is a system for performing uncertain inference; crisp true/false truth values are replaced not only by a probability, but also by a confidence level, indicating the certitude of the probability.

[[Markov logic network]]s allow uncertain inference to be performed; uncertainties are computed using the [[maximum entropy principle]], in analogy to the way that [[Markov chain]]s describe the uncertainty of [[finite state machine]]s.

'''World Charter for Nature''' was adopted by [[United Nations]] member nation-states on October 28, 1982. It proclaims five "principles of conservation by which all human conduct affecting nature is to be guided and judged."

# Nature shall be respected and its essential processes shall not be impaired. 
# The genetic viability on the earth shall not be compromised; the population levels of all life forms, wild and domesticated, must be at least sufficient for their survival, and to this end necessary habitats shall be safeguarded.
# All areas of the earth, both land and sea, shall be subject to these principles of conservation; special protection shall be given to unique areas, to representative samples of all the different types of ecosystems and to the habitats of rare or endangered species.
# Ecosystems and organisms, as well as the land, marine and atmospheric resources that are utilized by man, shall be managed to achieve and maintain optimum sustainable productivity, but not in such a way as to endanger the integrity of those other ecosystems or species with which they coexist. 
# Nature shall be secured against degradation caused by warfare or other hostile activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Charter for Nature|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/37/a37r007.htm|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=25 August 2013|author=United Nations General Assembly|date=28 October 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote was 111 for, one against ([[United States]]), 18 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = International Environmental Standards Handbook | author = Scott S. Olson | isbn = 1-56670-270-4 | year = 1999 | pages = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth in Arts''' is a [[non-profit]] organization that provides [[visual art|visual]] and [[performing arts]] instruction to public and private school students and enriches the community with cultural events. Youth in Arts has been providing [[Arts in education|arts education]] to [[students]] in the [[San Francisco]] [[Bay Area]] since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthinarts.org/|title=Youth In Arts San Rafael|publisher=Youthinarts.org|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], Ca. The Artists in Schools program brings artists into classrooms to teach visual and performing arts in extended residencies or shorter workshop programs and also provides training for teachers and parents in supporting students' learning and development through the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinmagazine.com/Marin-Magazine/June-2008/Art-for-Kids-Sake/|title=Art for Kids' Sake|publisher=Marinmagazine.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth in Arts also houses the only children's art gallery in the Northern Bay Area. Youth in Arts reaches over 30,000 youth annually.  Youth in Arts creates interactive public art works at the Marin County Fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/opinion/ci_15424234|title=Marin Voice: Fair brings world a little closer|publisher=Marinij.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During July 2013, Youth in Arts worked with over 600 youth and professional artists to create the world's biggest pop up book spanning 48' long and 6' high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinij.com/marinnews/ci_23621279/worlds-biggest-pop-up-book-displayed-at-marin|title=World's biggest pop-up book displayed at Marin County Fair|publisher=Marinij.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent evaluation of the Artists in Schools program, funded by a grant from the [[California Arts Council]], found that three-quarters of the students participating showed a more positive attitude toward learning in an arts-inclusive classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/03/05/NBGGC58DOH1.DTL|title=Fade to red / Program that brings arts to schools is running out of cash|work=SFGate|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools pay Youth in Arts for programming. The agency also fundraises to offset costs and to provide free programs to schools that cannot afford to pay.

In addition to the Artists in Schools program, Youth in Arts Presents offers live performances to thousands of local students through Theater Shows and Assemblies; VSA arts and "Arts Unite Us"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinscope.com/mill_valley_herald/news/article_76b4ccb0-020f-533a-be28-1f6ce5782295.html|title=Special Education and theater students create one-act play|work=Marinscope Community Newspapers|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide tailored programs to special needs students and bring together students of differing abilities through the arts and 'Til Dawn is an award-winning teen a cappella program for advanced young vocalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marinmagazine.com/Marin-Magazine/May-2010/Something-to-Sing-About/|title=Something to Sing About|publisher=Marinmagazine.com|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth in Arts founded the Italian Street Painting Festival in downtown San Rafael and ran that event for 17 years, that event is now being continued by a separate organization, Italian Street Painting Marin.
