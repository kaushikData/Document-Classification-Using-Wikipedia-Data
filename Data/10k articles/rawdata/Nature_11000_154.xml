'''''1942''''' is a [[Vertically scrolling video game|vertically scrolling]] [[shoot 'em up]] made by [[Capcom]] that was released for the [[Video arcade|arcade]] in {{vgy|1984}}. It was the first game in the ''19XX'' series. It was followed by ''[[1943: The Battle of Midway]]''.

''1942'' is set in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theater of World War II]]. The goal is to reach [[Tokyo]] and destroy the entire Japanese air fleet. The player pilots a [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning]] dubbed the "Super Ace". The player has to shoot down enemy planes; to avoid enemy fire, the player can perform a roll or vertical loop. During the game the player may collect a series of power-ups, one of them allowing the plane to be escorted by two other smaller fighters in a [[FICON project#Project MX-1016 aka Tip Tow|Tip Tow]] formation. There were few enemies: [[Kawasaki Ki-61]]s, [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s and [[Kawasaki Ki-48]]s. The boss plane is a [[Nakajima G8N]].

The game was later ported to the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] in 1985 in Japan, North America in 1986, (developed by [[Micronics]]), [[MSX]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[Windows Mobile]] Professional, and [[Game Boy Color]]. It was ported by the European games publisher [[Elite Systems]] to the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[ZX Spectrum]] and [[Commodore 64]]. The game was included as part of ''[[Capcom Classics Collection]]'' for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]] in 2005.
The arcade version was released on the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on December 21, 2010, the PAL region on January 21, 2011, and in North America on January 24, 2011.

==Music==
The music of the Commodore 64 version is based on the main verse of Ron Goodwin's ''[[633 Squadron]]'' movie score,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(Review for 1942: Arranged/Remixed tunes by Sabal Do'Ghym)|url=http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/review_show.php?id=2999|website=MIRSOFT|accessdate=4 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030002712/http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/review_show.php?id=2999|archivedate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with arrangement by Mark Cooksey.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/music_info.php%3Fid_ele%3DNTA%3D&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=M7xiUvzqHOOn0QW4rID4DQ&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAJOAo&amp;sig2=d_8AYPbmKrMad_LY9QPEqg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoK63Om-DU2EYpjV2alUW1xJa0eQ   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305024714/http://www.mirsoft.info/gmb/music_info.php?id_ele=NTA%3D&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=M7xiUvzqHOOn0QW4rID4DQ&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAJOAo&amp;sig2=d_8AYPbmKrMad_LY9QPEqg&amp;usg=AFQjCNFoK63Om-DU2EYpjV2alUW1xJa0eQ |date=March 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''1942'' was one of Capcom's first breakaway hits, eclipsing in popularity the company's preceding three titles: (''[[Vulgus]]'', ''[[SonSon (video game)|Sonson]]'', and ''[[Pirate Ship Higemaru]]''). In 1987, it was number-one on Euromax's UK arcade chart (followed by ''[[Wonder Boy]]'' at number-two).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solvalou.com/images/arcade/reviews/69.jpg Arcade Action], ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', December 1987&lt;/ref&gt; While not as popular as some of Capcom's series that would debut later in the 1980s (''[[Street Fighter]]'' and ''[[Mega Man]]'' in particular), ''1942'' would become one of Capcom's hallmark games throughout the arcade era.

Although not the first game to receive a sequel (with ''Pirate Ship Higemaru'' receiving a Japan-only console semi-sequel, ''[[Higemaru Makaijima]]'' in April 1987) ''1942'' was the first Capcom title to spawn a successful series of sequels, with five titles in the 19XX line released from 1987 to 2000.  Additionally, many of Capcom's other vertical shooters featured very similar gameplay to the series such as ''[[Varth: Operation Thunderstorm]]''.

''1942's'' longevity has shown through in many re-releases since its introduction, principally in ''[[Capcom Generations#Capcom Generations 1: Wings of Destiny|Capcom Generations 1]]'' for the PlayStation and Saturn consoles. It was featured in the [[Capcom Classics Collection]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], as well as [[Capcom Classics Collection: Reloaded]] for the [[PlayStation Portable]].

''1942: First Strike'' was released for [[iOS]] in 2010.

== ''1942: Joint Strike'' ==
{{main|1942: Joint Strike}}
A [[video game remake|remake]], ''[[1942: Joint Strike]]'' is available for [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and the [[PlayStation Network]]. The Xbox Live Arcade version was released on July 23, 2008, while the PlayStation Network version was released on July 24, 2008.

[[File:Agulhas Current system.jpg|thumb|The Agulhas Return Current (ARC) meanders east from the southern tip of Africa]]
The '''Agulhas Return Current''' ('''ARC''') is an [[ocean current]] in the South [[Indian Ocean]].  The ARC contributes to the water exchange between oceans by forming a link between the [[South Atlantic Current]] and the '''South Indian Ocean Current'''.&lt;ref name="Lutje-etal-Abstr"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutjeharms|Ansorge|2001|loc=Abstract, p. 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can reach velocities of up to {{Convert|4|kn}} and is therefore popular among participants in [[Yacht racing|trans-oceanic sailing race]]s.&lt;ref name="Boebel-etal-Intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Boebel|Rossby|Lutjeharms|Zenk|2003|loc=Introduction, pp. 35-37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oceanography==
The ARC originates from the [[Agulhas Current]], the [[western boundary current]] of the Indian Ocean, at the [[Agulhas Retroflection]] south of Africa and flows east along the [[Subtropical Front]], roughly around 39°S, north of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]].&lt;ref name="Boebel-etal-Intro" /&gt;

The Agulhas Current follows the continental shelf of the African east-coast, pass through the [[Agulhas Passage]] until it leaves the [[Agulhas Bank]] and reaches the [[Agulhas Basin]] south of South Africa.  From there it [[retroflect]]s almost completely back into the south Indian Ocean as the ARC, and only a smaller part, known as Agulhas leakage, is shed into the [[South Atlantic]].&lt;ref name="Lutje-etal-Intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutjeharms|Ansorge|2001|loc=Introduction, pp. 115-117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The water mass loses a lot of heat at the Agulhas Retroflection, up to {{Convert|200|W/m³|abbr=on}}, while evaporation and precipitation change the composition of the upper layers.  The ARC, therefore, has another composition than the Agulhas Current proper.&lt;ref name="Lutje-etal-Intro" /&gt;  It also loses velocity from {{Convert|110|-|75|cm/s|abbr=on}} and volume transport from 70 to 54 million m³/s.  Furthermore, all traces of Indian Tropical Surface Water are gone.&lt;ref name="Lutje-etal-Conclu"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutjeharms|Ansorge|2001|loc=Conclusions, pp. 135-136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having left the retroflection, the ARC meanders east between 36°S and 41°S.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rouault|Penven|Pohl|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These meanders were described as [[Rossby wave]]s in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are known to shed cold [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]] equatorward and enhance the [[primary productivity]] at the Subtropical Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lutjeharms|Ansorge|Gründlinch|Ballegooyen|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ARC makes a large, quasi-permanent northward meander around the [[Agulhas Plateau]] after which it loses more velocity and volume by leakage into the [[South Indian subtropical gyre]].  Over the [[Crozet Basin]] the last remnants of the ARC are gone.&lt;ref name="Lutje-etal-Conclu" /&gt;
As it enters the Crozet Basin at 53°E, the transport of the ARC is 35 Sv, most of which is recirculated northward before reaching the [[Kerguelen Islands|Kerguelen]]-[[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] Passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Park|Gamberoni|Charriaud|1993|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The current east of the Crozet Basin, at 66°E-70°E, is called the South Indian Ocean Current and lacks the distinctive features of the ARC.&lt;ref name="Lutje-etal-Conclu" /&gt;

'''Binding energy''' (also called separation energy) is the ''minimum'' [[energy]] required to disassemble a system of particles into separate parts. This energy is equal to the mass defect - the amount of energy, or mass, that is released when a [[Bound state|bound system]] (which typically has a lower [[potential energy]] than the sum of its constituent parts) is created, and is what keeps the system together. If the energy supplied is more than the binding energy, then the disassembled constituents possess non-zero kinetic energy.

==General idea==
&lt;!-- Introducing this header moves the list of headers into the top of the screen, so the other meanings of "Binding energy" are visible too. --&gt;
In general, binding energy represents the [[work (physics)|mechanical work]] that must be done against the forces that hold an object together, disassembling the object into its component parts with enough distance between them so that further separation requires negligible additional work.

In bound systems, if the binding energy is removed from the system, it must be subtracted from the [[mass]] of the unbound system, because this energy ''has'' mass. Thus, if energy is removed (or emitted) from the system at the time it is bound, this loss of energy will also result in the loss of the system's mass.&lt;ref&gt;''HyperPhysics'' - "Nuclear Binding Energy". ''C.R. Nave'', Georgia State University. Accessed 7 September 2010. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html&lt;/ref&gt; The mass of the system is not conserved in this process because the system is "open" (i.e., is not an [[isolated system]] to mass or energy input or loss) during the binding process.

There are several types of binding energy, each operating over a different distance and energy scale. The smaller the size of a bound system, the higher its associated binding energy.

==Mass-energy relation==
{{Main|Mass–energy equivalence|Mass in special relativity}}
A bound system is typically at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents because its mass must be less than the total mass of its unbound constituents. For systems with low binding energies, this "lost" mass after binding may be fractionally small, whereas for systems with high binding energies, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction. This missing mass may be lost during the process of binding as energy in the form of heat or light, with the removed energy corresponding to the removed mass through Einstein's equation [[Mass–energy equivalence|E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. In the process of binding, the constituents of the system might enter higher energy states of the nucleus/atom/molecule while retaining their mass, and because of this, it is necessary that they are removed from the system before its mass can decrease. Once the system cools to normal temperatures and returns to ground states regarding energy levels, it will contain less mass than when it first combined and was at high energy. This loss of heat represents the "mass deficit," and the heat itself retains the mass that was lost (from the point of view of the initial system). This mass will appear in any other system that absorbs the heat and gains thermal energy.&lt;ref&gt;E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, ''Spacetime Physics'', W.H. Freeman and Co., NY. 1992. {{ISBN|0-7167-2327-1}}, see pp. 248-9 for discussion of mass remaining constant after detonation of nuclear bombs until heat is allowed to escape.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if two objects are attracting each other in space through their [[gravitational field]], the attraction force accelerates the objects, increasing their velocity, which converts their potential energy (gravity) into kinetic energy. When the particles either pass through each other without interaction or elastically repel during the collision, the gained kinetic energy (related to speed) begins to revert into potential energy, driving the collided particles apart. The decelerating particles will return to the initial distance and beyond into infinity, or stop and repeat the collision (oscillation takes place). This shows that the system, which loses no energy, does not combine (bind) into a solid object, parts of which oscillate at short distances. Therefore, to bind the particles, the kinetic energy gained due to the attraction must be dissipated by resistive force. Complex objects in collision ordinarily undergo [[inelastic collision]], transforming some kinetic energy into internal energy (heat content, which is atomic movement), which is further radiated in the form of photons - the light and heat. Once the energy to escape the gravity is dissipated in the collision, the parts will oscillate at a closer, possibly atomic, distance, thus looking like one solid object. This lost energy, necessary to overcome the potential barrier to separate the objects, is the binding energy. If this binding energy were retained in the system as heat, its mass would not decrease, whereas binding energy lost from the system as heat radiation would itself have mass. It directly represents the "mass deficit" of the cold, bound system.

Closely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions in closed systems do not change mass, but do become less massive once the heat of reaction is removed, though this mass change is too small to measure with standard equipment. In [[nuclear reaction]]s, the fraction of mass that may be removed as light or heat, i.e., binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. It may thus be measured directly as a mass difference between [[rest mass]]es of reactants and (cooled) products. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than the Coulombic forces associated with the interactions between electrons and protons that generate heat in chemistry.

===Mass change===
Mass change (decrease) in bound systems, particularly atomic nuclei, has also been termed ''mass defect'', ''mass deficit'', or mass ''packing fraction''.{{citation needed|reason=I've never heard of the term packing fraction used in this context|date=December 2014}}

The difference between the unbound system calculated mass and experimentally measured mass of nucleus (mass change) is denoted as Δ''m''. It can be calculated as follows:
:Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) − (measured mass of system)
:: i.e., (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) − (measured mass of nucleus)

After a nuclear reaction occurs that results in an excited nucleus, the energy that must be [[radiation|radiated]] or otherwise removed as binding energy in order to decay to the unexcited state may be in one of several forms. This may be electromagnetic waves, such as [[gamma radiation]]; the kinetic energy of an ejected particle, such as an electron, in [[internal conversion]] decay; or partly as the rest mass of one or more emitted particles, such as the particles of [[beta decay]]. No mass deficit can appear, in theory, until this radiation or this energy has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.

When nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, they must lose a small amount of mass, i.e., there is a change in mass to stay bound. This mass change must be released as various types of photon or other particle energy as above, according to the relation E&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus, after the binding energy has been removed, '''binding energy = mass change × ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''. This energy is a measure of the forces that hold the nucleons together. It represents energy that must be resupplied from the environment for the nucleus to be broken up into individual nucleons.

The energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference of the binding energies of the "fuel," i.e. the initial nuclide(s), from that of the fission or fusion products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, which uses previous measurements of the [[atomic mass]]es of known nuclides, which always have the same mass for each species. This mass difference appears once evolved heat and radiation have been removed, which is required for measuring the (rest) masses of the (non-excited) nuclides involved in such calculations.

The '''Blue Riband''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|ɪ|b|ə|n|d}}) is an unofficial accolade given to the [[Passenger ship|passenger liner]] crossing the Atlantic Ocean  in regular service with the record highest speed. The term was borrowed from [[horse racing]] and was not widely used until after 1910.&lt;ref name=kludas&gt;{{cite book | last=Kludas | first=Arnold | title=Record breakers of the North Atlantic, Blue Riband Liners 1838–1952 | location=London  | publisher=Chatham  | year=2000 | isbn=1-86176-141-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite book | last=Fox | first=Stephen | title=Transatlantic: Samuel Cunard, Isambard Brunel and the Great Atlantic Steamships | location=New York | publisher=HarperCollins| year=2003| isbn=0-06-019595-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, the record is based on [[Velocity|average speed]] rather than passage time because ships follow different routes.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite book | last=Gibbs | first=Charles Robert Vernon | title=Passenger Liners of the Western Ocean: A Record of Atlantic Steam and Motor Passenger Vessels from 1838 to the Present Day | location=London | publisher=Staples Press | year=1957 | oclc=225962096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Also, eastbound and westbound speed records are reckoned separately, as the more difficult westbound record voyage, against the [[Gulf Stream]] and the prevailing weather systems, typically results in lower average speeds.

Of the 35 Atlantic liners to hold the Blue Riband, 25 were British, followed by five German, three American, as well as one each from Italy and France. Thirteen were [[Cunard Line|Cunarders]] (plus [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] of Cunard White Star), 5 by [[White Star Line|White Star]], with 4 owned by [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]], 2 by [[Collins Line|Collins]], 2 by [[Inman Line|Inman]] and 2 by [[Guion Line|Guion]], and one each by [[British and American Steam Navigation Company|British American]], [[Great Western Steamship Company|Great Western]], [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America]], the [[Italian Line]], [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] and finally the [[United States Lines]].&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;
The record set by ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in 1952 remains unbroken by any passenger liner.  The next longest period through which the Blue Riband was retained was 19 years, held from 1909 to 1929 by ''Mauretania''. The shortest period was 6 weeks, by ''Bremen'' from July to August 1933. 
[[File:SS United States on maiden voyage from Southampton.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[SS United States|SS ''United States'']], last winner of the Blue Riband.]]
Many of these ships were built with substantial government subsidies and were designed with military considerations in mind.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  [[Winston Churchill]] estimated that the two Cunard Queens helped shorten the Second World War by a year.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;  The last Atlantic liner to hold the Blue Riband, the [[SS United States|SS ''United States'']], was designed for her potential use as a troopship as well as her service as a commercial passenger liner.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

There was no formal award until 1935, when [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]]  donated the [[Hales Trophy]]; though the rules for the Hales Trophy were different from the traditional rules for the Blue Riband (for example, the [[Hales Trophy]] was originally only awarded for westbound records&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"&gt;Kludas p17&lt;/ref&gt;) and changed several times thereafter. It was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders during the express liner era. The trophy continues to be awarded, though many people believe the ''United States'' remains as the holder of the Blue Riband because no subsequent record breaker was in Atlantic passenger service.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

The [[Ocean rowing|Ocean Rowing]] Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of ocean rowing.&lt;ref name="oceanrowing.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanrowing.com/statistics/record_standard.htm|title=ocean rowing world records blue riband trophy|website=www.oceanrowing.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first well-documented crossing of the North Atlantic, though [[List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean|not the earliest]], was that of [[John Cabot]]'s ship [[Matthew (ship)|''Matthew'']] in the summer of 1497. ''Matthew'' crossed from [[Bristol]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 35 days, returning the following month in just 17 days.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Firstbrook (1997) ''The Voyage of the Matthew'' p118  BBC Books {{ISBN|0 563 38764 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the next three centuries countless vessels (merchant ships and warships, fast and slow, in peace and war) crossed back and forth over the North Atlantic, all subject to the vagaries of wind and weather.  They arrived at port when they could, dependent on the wind, and left when they were loaded, frequently visiting other ports to complete their cargo. During this period eastbound passages of 30 and 45 days were not uncommon, while westward passages of 65 to 90 days excited no attention. It was the advent of the steam ship, with its independence from wind power, which offered the possibility of regular, scheduled Atlantic crossings, in periods of two to three weeks, that opened a new era of transatlantic travel and competition.&lt;ref&gt;Kludas  p33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term “Blue Riband of the Atlantic” did not come into use until the 1890s, and the history of the trans-Atlantic competition, which was compiled retrospectively, was regarded as starting with the crossings by the steamships [[SS Sirius (1837)|''Sirius'']] and [[SS Great Western|''Great Western'']] in 1838. Although not the first steamships to cross the Atlantic ([[SS Savannah|''Savannah'']] had crossed in 1819, and [[SS Royal William|''Royal William'']] in 1831) nor the fastest to make the crossing (the [[Packet boat|packet]] sailing ship ''Columbia'' crossed west to east in 15 days 23 hours in 1830,&lt;ref&gt;Carl Cutler (1984) ''Greyhounds of the Sea|'' US Naval Institute {{ISBN|978-0850597288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and crossings by sail packets of 16 and 17 days were not unheard of) the ''Sirius'' and ''Great Western'' were the first steamships offering a regular, scheduled trans-Atlantic service; and crucially, they were involved in a race.&lt;ref&gt;Kludas p36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Cunard refused officially to recognise the title because racing vessels was not in line with the company's safety policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Transatlantic Liners|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/archive/rtf/Ships-Great%20Transatlantic%20Liners%2C%20The%20no8.rtf|website=Maritime Archives|publisher=Merseyside Maritime Museum|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paddlers (1838–72)===

The idea of building a line of transatlantic steamships was mooted in 1832 by Junius Smith, American lawyer turned London merchant. The idea came to him during an Atlantic crossing which took 57 days, a not unusual occurrence,&lt;ref&gt;Kludas p36&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published in the ''American Rail Road Journal''.&lt;ref name=pond&gt;{{cite book | last = Pond | first = Edgar LeRoy | coauthors = | title = Janius Smith | location =  | publisher=| year = 1927 | oclc = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving no support for several years, his plan gained credibility when Scottish shipbuilder, [[Macgregor Laird]] became an investor.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  Smith, who is often considered the ''Father of the Atlantic Liner'', formed the [[British and American Steam Navigation Company]] to operate a London-New York service. About the same time, the question of Atlantic steamships was discussed at an 1835 director's meeting of the newly formed Great Western Railway when the line’s chief engineer, [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] supposedly joked that the line could be made longer by building a steamship to run between Bristol and New York. The necessary investors were recruited by Brunel's friend, Thomas Guppy, a Bristol engineer and businessman.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite book | last = American Heritage | first =  | title = The Annihilation of Time and Space | location =  | publisher=| year = 1991 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year, the [[Great Western Steamship Company]] was established, even though the rail line was still years from completion.&lt;ref name=corlett&gt;{{cite book | last = Corlett | first = Ewan | title = The Iron Ship: the Story of Brunel's ss Great Britain | location =  | publisher=Conway | year = 1975 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By spring 1838, Brunel’s {{SS|Great Western||2}} was ready for sea, but Smith’s first ship was still without engines. When Great Western scheduled its initial sailing, Laird suggested that British and American charter the Irish Sea steamer {{SS|Sirius|1837|2}} from the St. George Steam Packet Company for two voyages to beat Great Western.&lt;ref name=heritage /&gt;  While the ''Sirius'' left [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland four days before ''Great Western'' departed [[Avonmouth]], ''Great Western'' still came within a day of overtaking ''Sirius'' to New York.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  To complete the voyage, ''Sirius'' was forced to burn spars when coal ran low.&lt;ref name=heritage /&gt;  With her westbound crossing at  8.03 [[Knots (speed)|knots]] (14.87 [[km/h]]), ''Sirius'' is often considered the first record holder even though the notion would not be used for several generations.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  ''Great Western'' herself became the prototype for all successful wooden paddlers and made a record-breaking voyage at {{convert|10.03|kn|km/h}} as late as 1843.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

[[File:RMS Europa.jpg|thumb|right|''Europa'' of 1848 set the record with a voyage of {{convert|11.79|kn|km/h}}. This is one of the earliest known photos of an Atlantic steamship.]]
The [[Cunard Line]] started its Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service in 1840 with the four ships that were slightly reduced versions of ''Great Western'' with about the same speed. Ultimately Cunard built nine additional wood paddlers. By 1846, Cunard was the only original steamship line that survived, largely because of its subsidy from the British [[Admiralty]] to carry the mails&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; and its emphasis on safety.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite book | last = Maxtone-Graham | first = John | title = The Only Way To Cross | location =  | publisher=Collier | year = 1972 | oclc = | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 1850, the record passed between various Cunarders, finally reaching {{convert|12.25|kn|km/h}} for an 8-day Liverpool-Halifax crossing by ''Asia''.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Record voyages during this period were often the result of using sails to gain extra speed from a following gale.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

Cunard's first serious competition for the record came from the American-owned [[Collins Line]].&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The American Government supplied Collins with a substantial subsidy to operate four wooden paddlers that were superior to Cunard's best.&lt;ref name=fry&gt;{{cite book | last = Fry | first = Henry | title = The History of North Atlantic Steam Navigation with Some Account of Early Ships and Shipowners| location = London | publisher=Sampson, Low &amp; Marston | year = 1896 | oclc = 271397492 | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, 1850, the {{SS|Pacific|1849|2}} set the record at {{convert|12.46|kn|km/h}} on a 10-day run from Liverpool to New York. Unfortunately, Collins suffered a setback when its {{SS|Arctic||2}} foundered with heavy loss of life.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The next year, Cunard put further pressure on Collins by commissioning its first iron-hulled paddler, the [[RMS Persia|''Persia'']], which set a new record with a 9-day, 16-hour Liverpool-New York voyage at {{convert|13.11|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  During the [[Crimean War]], Cunard supplied eleven of its ships for war service and suspended all routes except the Liverpool-Halifax-Boston service.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  While the Collins' fortunes improved because of the lack of competition during the war, Collins collapsed in 1858 after the loss of two additional steamers.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Cunard emerged as the leading carrier of first class passengers and in 1862 commissioned the [[RMS Scotia|''Scotia'']], the last paddle steamer to set a record with a Queenstown-New York voyage at {{convert|14.46|kn|km/h}}.  ''Scotia'' was the final significant paddler ordered for the Atlantic because under the terms of Cunard's mail contract with the Admiralty, it was still required to supply paddle steamers when needed for military service.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===Single screw steamers (1872–89)===
[[File:Adriatic (1871).jpg|thumb|White Star's ''Adriatic'' by George Parker Greenwood. She was the first successful screw liner with an 1872 run at {{convert|14.65|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:RMS Etruria.jpg|thumb|Cunard's ''Etruria'' of 1885, averaged {{convert|19.56|kn|km/h}} on a record-breaking 1888 crossing]]

In 1845, Brunel’s {{SS|Great Britain||2}} became the first iron-hulled screw liner on the Atlantic. Starting in 1850, the [[Inman Line]] built numerous reduced versions for the [[steerage (deck)|steerage]] trade. In 1866, Inman started to commission single screw express liners that were the equal of ''Scotia''.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The Admiralty allowed Cunard to order its first screw express liner, the ''Russia''.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the [[White Star Line]] commissioned [[RMS Oceanic (1870)|''Oceanic'']] and her five sisters. The following year, White Star’s ''Adriatic'' finally surpassed ''Scotia'' with a voyage at {{convert|14.65|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  The new White Star record breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines, but their high ratio of length to beam (10:1 compared to the previous norm of 8:1) increased vibration. To counter this, White Star placed the dining saloon midships and made their ships more luxurious. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard, but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  In 1875, Inman’s new [[SS City of Berlin|''City of Berlin'']] averaged {{convert|15.21|kn|km/h}} on its record-breaking voyage.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

During the five-year [[Panic of 1873|shipping depression]] that began in 1873, William Pearce, the controlling partner of the [[Fairfield Shipbuilding|John Elder shipyard]], became convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  He proposed a ship that crammed the most powerful machinery possible into the hull, sacrificing everything to speed.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the [[Guion Line]], a firm primarily engaged in the steerage trade. The first ship Pearce built for Guion, the [[SS Arizona|''Arizona'']] was described as a "souped up transatlantic hot rod" by one nautical historian.&lt;ref name=fox /&gt;  While she only won the eastbound record,&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  two years later, Guion took delivery of the even faster ''Alaska'' that set the record at {{convert|16.07|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  To continue the program, Pearce offered Guion favourable terms on a third unit, the [[SS Oregon (1883)|''Oregon'']], which raised the record to {{convert|18.56|kn|km/h}} in 1884.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  These ships were uncomfortable and their excessive coal consumption made them uneconomic.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  However, for a while they were popular with American clients because of their American ownership.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;

After being out of the contest for a decade, Cunard finally started to rebuild. In 1884, Cunard purchased ''Oregon'' from the Guion line when that firm defaulted on payments to the shipyard. Later that year, Cunard commissioned the first steel-hulled record-breakers, [[RMS Umbria|''Umbria'']] and [[RMS Etruria|''Etruria'']].&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  ''Etruria'', the faster of the pair, raised the record to {{convert|19.56|kn|km/h}} on a 6-day, 2-hour run from Queenstown to Sandy Hook in 1888. However, ''Etruria'' and her sister represented the limit of single screw technology.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===Double screw steamers (1889–1907)===
[[File:City of paris.jpg|thumb|Inman's ''City of Paris'' set a record of {{convert|20.01|kn|km/h}} in 1889.]]
[[File:Kaiser wilhelm der grosse 01.jpg|thumb|NDL's ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse'' raised the record to {{convert|22.29|kn|km/h}} in 1898]]
The Inman line fell on hard times after their intended record-breaker, ''City of Rome'' failed to meet expectations and was returned to her builders in 1882. Inman directors agreed to voluntary liquidation so that the largest creditor, the Philadelphia-based [[International Navigation Company]] could purchase Inman's assets.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  The new owners provided the capital to build two outstanding record breakers, the twin screw {{SS|City of New York||2}} and the {{SS|City of Paris|1888|2}}. Starting in 1889, the later ship set the record on four occasions, including a voyage at {{convert|20.7|kn|km/h}} in 1892. White Star, which had not built an express liner since the {{SS|Germanic|1875|2}} of 1875, commissioned the record-breaker, {{SS|Teutonic|1889|2}} of 1889 and {{SS|Majestic|1890|2}} of 1890 after receiving a subsidy from the [[Admiralty]] to make the pair available as merchant cruisers in the event of hostilities. Cunard countered with two even faster ships, the [[RMS Campania|''Campania'']] and the [[RMS Lucania|''Lucania'']] of 1893.&lt;ref name=fry /&gt;  The next year, ''Lucania'' recorded a voyage at {{convert|21.81|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Inman became the [[American Line]] and ordered two additional express liners from American yards, but no attempt was made to best the new Cunarders. In 1894, Guion ceased sailing as its ships were now hopelessly outdated.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

No sooner had Cunard reestablished its supremacy than new rivals emerged. Beginning in the late 1860s, several German firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the British mail steamers working from Liverpool.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  In 1889, the [[Hamburg America Line|Hamburg-America Line]] commissioned four double screw steamers capable of {{convert|18.00|kn|km/h}}. Its rival, [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] (NDL) lagged behind until 1895 when it ordered two ships intended to take the record. In 1898, the {{SS|Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse||2}} raised the record to {{convert|22.29|kn|km/h}}, while the other liner, ''Kaiser Friedrich'' failed to achieve her contract speed and was returned to her builders. Hamburg America ordered the even more powerful {{SS|Deutschland|1900|2}} that reached {{convert|23.06|kn|km/h}} on one of her record-breaking 1900 voyages. However, Hamburg America quickly learned that these high powered double screw liners had vibration problems. ''Deutschland'' had the unpleasant nickname, "cocktail shaker" and actually lost part of her stern in 1902 because of the constant vibration.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

Rather than match the new German speedsters, White Star decided to drop out of the competition and commission the four large ''Celtic''-class luxury liners of more moderate speed. White Star realised that passengers preferred comfort even if this means spending an extra day at sea. In 1902, White Star joined the well capitalised American combine, the [[International Mercantile Marine Co.]] (IMM) that owned the American Line and others. IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg America and Norddeutscher Lloyd. After its bad experience with the ''Deutschland'', Hamburg America also dropped out of the race and commissioned large luxury liners based on the ''Celtic''. However, NDL completed building a fleet of four additional express liners modelled on ''Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse''.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

===Ships of state (1907–69)===
[[File:RMS Mauretania.jpg|thumb|Cunard's ''Mauretania'' held the Blue Riband from 1909 to 1929 at {{convert|26.06|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-11081, Schnelldamper "Bremen".jpg|thumb|NDL's ''Bremen'' finally broke ''Mauretania'''s record in 1929 by averaging {{convert|27.83|kn|km/h}}]]
[[File:B-17s flyby Rex.jpg|thumb|The Italian ''Rex'' joined the Blue Riband club with a 1933 voyage of {{convert|28.92|kn|km/h}}]]

[[File:Rms queen mary 2008.jpg|thumb|Cunard White Star's ''Queen Mary'' regained the Blue Riband at {{convert|30.99|kn|km/h}} in 1938.]]
[[File:SS United States postcard.jpg|thumb|''United States'' won the Blue Riband at {{convert|34.51|kn|km/h}} in 1952. Formally, she still holds the title.]]
After 1902, only the Cunard Line and the French [[Compagnie Générale Transatlantique]] (CGT) were independent of the IMM combine. British prestige was at stake, and the Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £150,000 plus a low interest loan of £2.5&amp;nbsp;million to pay for the construction of the two [[Superliner (passenger ship)|superliners]], [[RMS Lusitania|''Lusitania'']] and [[RMS Mauretania (1906)|''Mauretania'']] under the condition that they be available for conversion to armed cruisers when needed by the navy.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Starting in 1907, both ships won the Blue Riband and ''Mauretania’s'' 1909 record of {{convert|26.06|kn|km/h}} stood for 20 years.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  However, these ships paid a price for speed and lacked many of the amenities found in the new White Star and Hamburg American luxury liners. Both Cunard rivals ordered a trio of even bigger luxury liners, the White Star [[Olympic class ocean liner|''Olympic''-class]] capable of {{convert|21.5|kn|km/h}} and Hapag [[SS Imperator|''Imperator''-class]] capable of {{convert|22.5|kn|km/h}}. Even Cunard chose this approach when it ordered its third superliner, the [[RMS Aquitania|''Aquitania'']].&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;

There is a persistent rumor that {{RMS|Titanic}} was attempting to win the Blue Riband and that such effort resulted in excessive speed and collision with the iceberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maltin|first1=Tim|last2=Aston|first2=Eloise|title=101 things you thought you knew about the Titanic-- but didn't!|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0143119098|pages=43-47}}Chapter 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a rumor is undoubtedly false, as the Titanic was built for luxury not speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.titanic-titanic.com/titanic_myths.shtml|title=Titanic Myths|author=|date=|website=www.titanic-titanic.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the war, Hamburg American and Norddeutscher Lloyd lost their premier units. In 1926, the U.S. Government awarded Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) $27&amp;nbsp;million in compensation for its confiscated liners. By this time, improvements in turbine technology and hull form along with the use of fuel oil instead of coal made it possible to build more civilised record breakers. Using these funds, NDL ordered two ships designed to cross the Atlantic in five days, the {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}. However, the American government netted the award against debts owed by the German Government and Berlin was forced to directly subsidise NDL to continue the project.  ''Bremen'' recorded {{convert|27.83|kn|km/h}} on her 1929 Blue Riband voyage and ''Europa'' increased the Blue Riband to {{convert|27.92|kn|km/h}} in 1933.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

In 1928, as Britain's response to the German {{SS|Bremen|1929|2}} and {{SS|Europa|1930|2}}, the [[White Star Line]] ordered a new Diesel-electric 1000-ft long ocean liner to be named [[Oceanic (unfinished ship)|''Oceanic'']] capable of  200,000 SHP. Construction started June 28, 1928. However, White Star did not have the funds to complete the liner. Oceanic's construction was put on hold until 1931 when her keel was silently scrapped. Oceanic's ahead-of-their-time engines would have been powerful enough to enable her to possibly win the Blue Riband.

In 1929, two lines from Italy each ordered a ship based on the German pair. Just as these ships were being completed, the Italian government nationalised the shipping industry, creating the [[Italian Line]]. While both superliners were successful, only the {{SS|Rex||2}} won the Blue Riband, with a 1933 voyage at {{convert|28.92|kn|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

CGT also ordered a new superliner in 1929. The next year, Cunard started construction on an 80,000 ton liner that was to be the first of two record breakers fast enough to fit into a two ship weekly Southampton-New York service.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt; Consequently, CGT altered its plans to make its new liner even bigger.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  However, as the 1929 shipping depression intensified, construction on Cunard’s hull 534 was halted while work on the heavily subsidised French ship continued. By 1934, both Cunard and White Star lines were failing and the British Government was concerned about potential job losses. Therefore, the government agreed to give Cunard a loan of £3&amp;nbsp;million to complete hull 534 as the {{RMS|Queen Mary||2}} and an additional £5&amp;nbsp;million to build a second ship, the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth||2}} only if Cunard merged with White Star.&lt;ref name=graham /&gt;

CGT's {{SS|Normandie||2}} entered service in 1935 and won the Blue Riband at {{convert|29.98|kn|km/h}}.  ''Queen Mary'' was commissioned the next year, and after a few break-in voyages, took the Blue Riband to {{convert|30.14|kn|km/h}}. The two liners were operated a pair and traded the Blue Riband again, with the Cunard White Star Liner ultimately posting {{convert|30.99|kn|km/h}} in 1938.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt; ''Queen Mary’s'' consort, ''Queen Elizabeth'', was commissioned after war was declared and was never allowed to attempt the record.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;

In 1935, [[Harold Hales|Harold K. Hales]] (1868–1942), a member of the UK Parliament and owner of a shipping company, commissioned [[Hales Trophy|a large trophy]] to be presented to the fastest ship crossing the Atlantic, in order to formalize the rules surrounding the trans Atlantic competition. The rules for the trophy did not correspond to the traditional rules for the Blue Riband in that the trophy was to be awarded only to surface passenger ship achieving the fastest speed in the westbound direction.&lt;ref name="Kludas p17"/&gt; Other rule changes further complicated the situation, and eventually the trophy was awarded to just three Blue Riband holders; ''Rex'', in 1935, ''Normandie'' in 1936, and ''United States'' in 1952.

Of the ships of state, only ''Queen Mary'', ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Europa'' survived the war. ''Europa'' became CGT's ''Liberte'' and no attempt was made to retain her former speed when she was reconstructed.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  However, the United States government was impressed by the large numbers of troops carried by the Queens during the war, and ordered a superliner that was as much a troop carrier as an express liner. On her maiden voyage in 1952, the [[SS United States|''United States'']] upped the Blue Riband to {{convert|34.51|kn|km/h}}. In 1958, the transatlantic airlines put jet transports into service and the days of the record breakers were numbered.  ''Liberte'' retired in 1961, along with ''Queen Mary'' in 1967, and ''United States'' in 1969.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

===The Blue Riband today (1969–present)===
With the success of ''United States'' in 1952 and Cunard's decision not to challenge the new record the Blue Riband contest again subsided. There was a growing recognition that the era of fast crossings by express liners was becoming a thing of the past, and that the contest for fast transatlantic travel was shifting to the air.&lt;ref name=Times8752&gt;[http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/newspaperRetrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=DateAscend&amp;tabID=T003&amp;prodId=TTDA&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchId=R1&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=13&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28tx%2CNone%2C11%29Blue+Riband%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28da%2CNone%2C23%2901%2F01%2F1952+-+12%2F31%2F1952%3AAnd%3ALQE%3D%28MB%2CNone%2C8%29%22TTDA-1%22%24&amp;retrieveFormat=MULTIPAGE_DOCUMENT&amp;userGroupName=livlibtda&amp;inPS=true&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;&amp;docId=&amp;docLevel=FASCIMILE&amp;workId=&amp;relevancePageBatch=CS117919464&amp;contentSet=UDVIN&amp;callistoContentSet=UDVIN&amp;docPage=article&amp;hilite=y The Blue Riband]: Editorial, 8 July 1952, [[The Times]]; retrieved 31 July 12017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, air travel was already competing with the express liners for fast Atlantic crossings; in 1936 the German company DELAG commenced an airship service to New York, their [[LZ 129 Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']] crossing from Europe to America in times ranging from 53 to 78 hours, and the following year, while  experimenting with a flying boat service, Empire Airways [[Short Empire#Operational history|''Caledonia'']] reduced this to 15 hours.
In the post-war period times were reduced again by  the advent of land based airliners, such as the [[Lockheed Constellation]]. Hopes in 1952 were expressed for the new [[de Havilland Comet]] jetliner,&lt;ref name=Times8752/&gt; though these were dashed by [[de Havilland Comet#Early hull losses|the succession of crashes]] that halted the Comet programme. A regular jetliner service was finally introduced in 1958 with the [[Boeing 707]] and the [[Douglas DC-8|DC 8]], cutting the crossing to 7 hours. The final step in the quest for trans-Atlantic speed was the [[BAC Concorde]], which set a record in 1996 of a second under two hours 53 minutes, at an average speed of 1250&amp;nbsp;mph (Mach 1.9),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/1996-fastest-flight-across-the-atlantic-in-a-commercial-aircraft-392882 1996: Fastest flight across the Atlantic in a commercial aircraft] at [[Guinness World Records]], retrieved 30 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; but by this time airlines were aware that cost and comfort were more important to passengers than speed, and the emphasis shifted to aircraft like the [[Boeing 747]], with a sleeper capacity for business passengers.

[[File:Gentry_Eagle.jpg|thumb|Tom Gentry's ''Gentry Eagle'' at Mamaroneck, New York, prior to a record attempt.]]
At sea ''United States'' record stood until 1986, when it was challenged by British entrepreneur [[Richard Branson]], and his  high-speed motor vessel, ''Virgin Atlantic Challenger''. Despite having to stop to refuel on several occasions, Branson shaved two hours off the record, increasing the average speed to 36.4 knots. However, as '' Virgin Atlantic Challenger'' was not a passenger vessel the New York Maritime Museum refused to part with the Hales Trophy, so Branson inaugurated the [[Virgin Atlantic Challenge Trophy]], for the fastest unqualified Atlantic crossing, open to all challengers. Three years later this was won by Tom Gentry, whose ''Gentry Eagle'' slashed the record, crossing in 62 hours at an average 47.4 knots. 
In 1992 the Virgin Atlantic Challenge was again won, by the [[Aga Khan]]'s ''[[Destriero]]'' crossing in 58 hour 34 minutes and averaging 53.09 knots. She also made a record-breaking return journey, winning the [[Columbus Atlantic Trophy]], posted by the yacht club in response to the Virgin Atlantic Challenge for the fastest two-way voyage i.e. a single crossing and return voyage within a specified time.

Meanwhile, [[Incat]], builders of fast catamaran ferries, and therefore indisputably commercial vessels, decided to make an attempt to win the Hales Trophy, for which the record was still that of  ''United States''. This was achieved in 1990 by ''[[Hoverspeed Great Britain]]'', with a non-stop crossing of 79 hours 54 minutes, averaging 36.6 knots and Incat were awarded the trophy by the Hales Trophy Committee. Eight years later this record was broken by another Incat vessel, ''[[Catalonia (ship)|Catalonia]]'' and again the following month by ''[[Cat-Link V]]''.

The [[Ocean rowing|Ocean Rowing]] Society inspired by The Blue Riband concept created Blue Riband Trophy of Ocean Rowing awarded to the fastest crew to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an unsupported row boat. Presently it is the most sought after trophy of Ocean Rowing.&lt;ref name="oceanrowing.com"/&gt;

With the end of the express liners era the Blue Riband has become an item of largely historical interest, with some authors regarding the ''United States'' as the last holder of the accolade;&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt; meanwhile the goal of the fastest Atlantic crossings remains a physical and technological challenge and at least three awards for the feat remain in play.

==List of record breakers==
The following is the latest consensus list of the research to date. Because there was no sanctioning body for the Blue Riband, researchers are limited to surviving shipping company archives and press reports to develop the list of Blue Riband winners. These lists are retrospective, and limited to steamships only. Therefore, most lists feature ''Sirius'', in her race with ''Great Western'' in 1838, as the first record-holder, although her crossing was not as fast as some sail packet ships of the period. Early writers including Arthur Maginnus (1892), Henry Frey (1896), Charles Lee (1931) and C. R. Benstead (1936) were the standard sources until the 1950s. Since then, C. R. Vernon Gibbs (1952),&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; and Noel Bonsor (1975) added to the body of knowledge, with additional detail about the German ships provided by Arnold Kludas.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

Over the years, the lists have not agreed. For example, Gibbs credits Inman's ''City of Paris'' with an 1866 Blue Riband voyage, and Cunard's ''Russia'' with an eastbound record the following year because he considered as dubious ''Scotia's'' Blue Riband claim of {{convert|14.46|kn|km/h}}, supposedly based on a very long track.&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt;  Later writers have included the ''Scotia'' claim.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;  Gibbs also includes the claimed Blue Riband voyage at {{convert|17.6|kn|km/h}} of the National Line's ''America'' of 1884&lt;ref name=gibbs /&gt; that was not confirmed by later researchers.&lt;ref name=kludas /&gt;

'''Boiling down''' is the process of [[rendering (food processing)|rendering]] fat from animal carcasses to produce [[tallow]]. It was a common small-farm activity for making soap and candles for domestic use, but was industrialised in the early 19th century, particularly in Australia.

==Beginnings==

In the 1840s, the overseas market for Australian wool suffered a severe price slump, while the local market for mutton was flooded. The boiling-down works became the saviour of the squatters when sheep were selling for as low as sixpence. Henry O'Brien of Yass developed a means of boiling down sheep in large cauldrons to extract the tallow (fat for soap and candle making). Even when the wool price recovered boiling down works helped maintain a minimum price closer to five shillings per head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karanamtcrosbyconnections.org.au/karana_mt_crosby/01_cms/details.asp?ID=123 Overlanders and Boiling Downciting Nissen J.A., Creating the landscape: A history of settlement and land use in Mt Crosby, Master of Arts Thesis, U of Q, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423221659/http://www.karanamtcrosbyconnections.org.au/karana_mt_crosby/01_cms/details.asp?ID=123 |date=April 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Langlands foundry|Langlands and Fulton]] operated an iron foundry at 131 Flinders St West, [[Melbourne, Australia]], where Fulton developed a technique for boiling-down sheep for tallow around in 1843-44 when squatters slaughtered their otherwise worthless sheep in the thousands due to a rural depression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/langlands-henry-2328/text3027, Cashman, Richard I., 'Langlands, Henry (1794–1863)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 17 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Victoria, Joseph Raleigh is credited with one of the first large scale boiling-down works, when in 1840 he erected a plant near the Stney Creek Backwasy in [[Yarraville, Victoria|Yarraville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onmydoorstep.com.au/heritage-listing/15061/raleighs-boiling-down-works Onmydoorstep, Raleigh's Boiling Down Works]&lt;/ref&gt; From a very small quantity of 50 tons of tallow produced in 1843, to 430 in tons in 1844, over 4500 tons, worth £130,000 were produced in 1850 in Victoria alone.&lt;ref&gt;Robyn Annear, ''Bearbrass: Imagining Early Melbourne'', Black Inc., 2005 - Melbourne (Vic.) p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert King opened the first boiling down works in the Bremer River area of [[Ipswich, Queensland]] in 1847, followed by John Campbell and John Smith, creating a self-contained village of Town Marie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/documents/heritage/education_kit_industry.pdf BOILING DOWN WORKS, Ipswich Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008162459/http://www.ipswich.qld.gov.au/documents/heritage/education_kit_industry.pdf |date=October 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Before the town of Brzesko became a ghetto, about two-thirds of the population was Jewish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When the Germans came to the town of Brzesko they took [[hostage]]s from the Jewish population and demanded money from the town.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The town businesses owned by Jews were also forced to put signs up marking that they were owned by Jews and preventing future business.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many Jews were forced to leave their line of work and pick up new jobs given to them by the Germans forces which included many cleaning jobs. The people put into [[Unfree labour|forced labor]] included men between the ages of 15 and 60.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, the Jews were outfitted with armbands displaying the [[Star of David]] on their right arm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34742446|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews 1939-1945: The Years of Extermination|last=Friedländer|first=Saul|date=2007|publisher=HarperCollins|others=Mazal Holocaust Collection.|year=|isbn=0060190426|edition= 1st |location=New York|pages=38–41|oclc=34742446}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the armbands, the exclusion from many businesses and activities followed including that from restaurants, parks, and stores.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Although they faced great discrimination in their town, many of the Jews still considered themselves citizens of the town and still felt obligated to improve it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the occupation of the town, the Germans would come to the town and shoot citizens. These citizens were both random and targeted by the [[Ordnungspolizei|Order Police]]. Some of the police involved included Wilhelm Rommelman, Lapsch, and Beck.In addition, burglaries were a problem in and around Brzesko before it became a ghetto.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=A RECORD OF POGROMS IN POLAND: Massacres Began in Lemberg, According to Documents Received Here, and Spread Over Country--Women Violated, Men Slain, Synagogues Ruined, Property Taken Lemberg a Starting Point.

== Ghetto History ==
German Gendarmerie from Brzesko murdered Jews from Brzesko and region and ethnic Poles.&lt;ref&gt;W. Curilla, ''Der Judenmord in Polen und die deutsche Ordnungspolizei 1939-1945'', page 383&lt;/ref&gt;
When the ghetto was first created in 1940 it was an open ghetto. It was marked by signs, but had no barriers to keep the Jewish people inside the town. The Jews were not allowed to leave and any movement in or out of the city was monitored.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Having the ghetto opened allowed for smuggling of food in by nearby Aryan community. After it was closed, this responsibility fell on the [[Jewish Ghetto Police|Jewish Police]]. This section of Jewish Police was led by Diestler. Trades between the Jewish residents and the Jewish Police occurred at night.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Jewish people living in the ghetto were also low on winter apparel and supplies because the German Troops took it in preparation for the invasion of Russia. In 1941 the open ghetto became a closed ghetto when a fence surrounded the town.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Overpopulation became a problem when the ghetto was fenced off. The camp had about ten people per window which decreased sanitation throughout the camp. This led to an outbreak of typhoid. [[Typhoid fever|Typhoid]] was one of the major causes of death within the ghetto along with starvation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46640962|title=The Encyclopedia of Jewish life before and during the Holocaust|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Yad Vashem|others=Spector, Shmuel., Wigoder, Geoffrey, 1922-|year=|isbn=0814793568|location=Jerusalem|pages=205|oclc=46640962}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the doctors helping those with Typhoid fever was Maurycy Gross.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even with the outbreak of typhoid. the main source of death within the ghetto was the German forces. When a Jew was shot by someone in the Nazi party, they would force other Jews within the community to sign a document stating they died from natural causes. In addition, the Jews had to pay for any ammunition used to shoot other Jewish people within Brzesko. During the year of 1942, three Aktions took place within the Brzesko Ghetto. These killed about 300 Jews total and were conducted by the Order Police which included people such as Lapsch, Wagner, and Mikler. In 1943 about 2,000 Jewish people were sent to the Belzec death camp, about 150 miles from Brzesko. Another 4,000 Jewish people were sent to the Auschwitz death camp that same year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to accomplish the deportation, all the Jews living in Brzesko were gathered in the square of the town.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout the process of deportation to the death camps, any citizens considered too weak to travel were shot in the town square. This could be due to illness, age, or injury. Those left behind after the deportation were sent to Tarnów or killed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Kirkut cemetery was the site of many executions from the Brzesko Ghetto. The cemetery still contains the graves of those who died during WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmentarze.gorlice.net.pl/Brzesko/okreg7_cz3.htm#276|title=Robert Kozłowski|website=www.cmentarze.gorlice.net.pl|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a monument in place to mark the mass grave of the Jews that died in Brzesko.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Throughout the lifespan of the ghetto Jews within the ghetto worked to escape. Some of the Jews escaped into the nearby woods where they hid until they could escape or were caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Sisters' Story|last=Leiter|first=Robert|date=2008|work=Jewish Exponent|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Jews tried to escape by using fake Aryan documents forged for them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Paulina Tider and her family were part of the group that got Aryan papers to escape Brzesko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn73379|title=Oral history interview with Paulina Tider - Collections Search - United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=collections.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who was caught outside the ghetto boundaries was caught by the [[Blue Police|Polish police]] guarding the ghetto and delivered to the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During the deportation, Dr. Jan Brzeski helped some of the Jews who had escaped by keeping them healthy until they could come out of hiding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Jewish Council (Judenrat) of Brzesko ==
The [[Judenrat]] was formed to meet the demands of the Germans through forced labor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Though the council was made up of Jews who believed they were making a difference, the purpose of the served only German needs. This included taking a census of Brzesko.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The division of the Jewish Council was led by Jakub Hendler.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also oversaw the counties of Szczurowa and Borzecin.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additional groups within Brzesko included the Central Organization for Orphan Care, Jewish Social Self-Help, and Committee for the Aid to Refugees and the Poor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

'''''Castilla elastica''''', the '''Panama rubber tree''', is a tree native to the [[Tropics|tropical]] areas of [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and northern [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the principal source of [[latex]] among the [[Mesoamerica]]n peoples in [[pre-Columbian]] times. The latex gathered from ''Castilla elastica'' was converted into usable [[rubber]] by mixing the latex with the juice of the [[morning glory]] species ''[[Ipomoea alba]]'' which, conveniently, is typically found in the wild as a [[vine]] climbing ''Castilla elastica''. The rubber produced by this method found several uses, including most notably, the manufacture of balls for the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] ''ōllamaliztli''.

The [[Aztec]] ([[Nahuatl]]) word for rubber was ''ulli / olli'', from which their word for the ballgame derived), and also their name for the ancient people they associated with the origin of the ballgame, the [[Olmec]]s (''olmeca'': "rubber people"). The Nahuatl word for the tree of ''Castilla elastica'' is '''''olicuáhuitl''''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conabio.gob.mx/conocimiento/info_especies/arboles/doctos/48-morac2m.pdf |title=''Castilla elastica'' |publisher=Comisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] it is known as '''palo de hule'''.

[[Image:Daikoku.jpg|thumb|right|Daikoku, God of Wealth|upright]]
In [[Japan]], '''Daikokuten''' ([[wiktionary:大黒天|大黒天]]), the god of great darkness or blackness, or the god of five cereals, is one of the [[Seven Lucky Gods]] (''Fukujin''). Daikokuten evolved from the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] form of the [[Deva (Hinduism)|Indian deity]] [[Shiva]] [[Shinbutsu-shūgō|intertwined]] with the [[Shinto]] god [[Ōkuninushi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jeremy|last=Roberts|title=Japanese Mythology A to Z|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2009|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdfgjV2kw6oC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is the Japanese equivalent of '''[[Mahākāla]]''', the Hindu name for Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Pratapaditya|last=Pal|title=Indian Sculpture: 700-1800|publisher=Los Angeles County Museum of Art|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The god enjoys an exalted position as a household deity in Japan. Daikoku's association with wealth and prosperity precipitated a custom known as ''fukunusubi'', or "theft of fortune". This custom started with the belief that whoever stole divine figures was assured of good fortune if not caught in the act. The ''toshi-no-ichi'' (year-end market) held at [[Sensō-ji]] became the main venue of the sale and disposal of such images by the fortune-seekers. Many small stalls were opened where articles including images of Daikoku were sold on the eve of New Year celebrations.&lt;ref name="Thakur1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thakur|first=Upendra|title=Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m42TldA_OvAC&amp;pg=PA190|year=1986|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-207-9|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese also maintain the symbol of Mahakala as a monogram. The traditional pilgrims climbing the holy [[Mount Ontake]] wear [[tenugui]] (a kind of white scarf) with the [[Bīja|seed syllable]] of Mahakala.

Daikoku is variously considered to be the god of wealth, or of the household, particularly the kitchen. He is recognised by his wide face, smile, and a flat black hat. He is often portrayed holding a golden [[mallet]] called ''[[Uchide no kozuchi]]'', otherwise known as the "mallet of fortune", and is seen seated on bales of [[rice]], with [[Rat|rats]] nearby signifying plentiful food.

Daikoku's image was featured on the first Japanese bank note, designed by [[Edoardo Chiossone]].

==Goddess Daikokutennyo==
The [[Butsuzōzui|Butsuzōzui compendium]] of 1690 (reprinted and expanded in 1796) lists and illustrates six different manifestations of Daikoku, including the feminine form known as Daikokunyo (大黒女) ("She of the Great Blackness") or Daikokutennyo (大黒天女) ("She of the Great Blackness of the Heavens").&lt;ref name="Butsuzōzui059"&gt;{{cite web|title=Butsuzōzui (Illustrated Compendium of Buddhist Images)|url=http://www.lib.ehime-u.ac.jp/SUZUKA/316/index.html|location=Ehime University Library|page=(059.jpg)|language=Japanese|format=digital photos|date=1796}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Daikoku is the [[wiktionary:nipponize|nipponized]] form of the masculine [[Mahākāla]], Daikokutennyo is the nipponized form of the feminine [[Mahakali|Mahākāli]].

When Daikoku is regarded as the feminine Daikokutennyo&lt;ref name="Butsuzōzui059"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kisshōten|Kisshoutennyo]] is counted among the [[Seven_Lucky_Gods|seven Fukujin]],&lt;ref name="Butsuzōzui077"&gt;{{cite web|title=Butsuzōzui (Illustrated Compendium of Buddhist Images)|url=http://www.lib.ehime-u.ac.jp/SUZUKA/316/index.html|location=Ehime University Library|page=(077.jpg)|language=Japanese|format=digital photos|date=1796}}&lt;/ref&gt; all three of the Hindu [[Tridevi]] goddesses are represented among the Fukujin.

'''Edward Paul Abbey''' (January 29, 1927 – March 14, 1989) was an American author and essayist noted for his advocacy of [[environmentalism|environmental issues]], criticism of [[public land]] policies, and [[anarchist]] political views. His best-known works include the [[novel]] ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'', which has been cited as an inspiration by environmental groups, and the non-fiction work ''[[Desert Solitaire]]''.

==Early life and education==
Abbey was born in [[Indiana, Pennsylvania]], on January 29, 1927 to Mildred Postlewait and Paul Revere Abbey. Mildred was a schoolteacher and a church organist, and gave Abbey an appreciation for classical music and literature. Paul was a [[socialist]], [[anarchist]], and [[atheist]] whose views strongly influenced Abbey.&lt;ref name="Mongillo-2001"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Mongillo |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Booth |editor2-first=Bibi |title=Environmental Activists |date=2001 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport CT |isbn=0313308845 |url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1}}

Abbey graduated from [[high school]] in Indiana, Pennsylvania, in 1945. Eight months before his 18th birthday, when he would be faced with being [[Conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States military]], Abbey decided to explore the American southwest. He traveled by foot, bus, [[hitchhiking]], and [[freight train hopping]].&lt;ref name="peterson-2003-1" /&gt; During this trip he fell in love with the [[desert]] country of the [[Four Corners]] region. Abbey wrote:
"&lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt;crags and pinnacles of naked rock, the dark cores of ancient [[volcanoes]], a vast and silent emptiness smoldering with heat, color, and indecipherable significance, above which floated a small number of pure, clear, hard-edged clouds. For the first time, I felt I was getting close to the West of my deepest imaginings, the place where the tangible and the mythical became the same."&lt;ref name=Ronald-1982&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald, Ann|title=The New West of Edward Abbey|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=1982|isbn=0874173574|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=th4RcKPOldMC&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|59}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Western Literature Association|chapter=Edward Abbey|title=A Literary history of the American West|publisher=TCU Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0-87565-021-0|page=604|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AFfqbTjG7OkC&amp;pg=PA604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Abbey's full account of this trip, see his essay [https://books.google.com/books?id=zU4yQmhETbQC&amp;pg=PA22 "Hallelujah on the Bum"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the military Abbey had applied for a clerk typist position but instead served two years as a [[military police officer]] in Italy. Abbey was promoted in the military twice but, due to his knack for opposing authority, was twice demoted and was [[honorably discharged]]&lt;ref name="peterson-2003-1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peterson, David|title=Confessions of a barbarian: selections from the journals of Edward Abbey|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55566-287-5|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRueIqU-kSIC&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a private. His experience with the military left him with a distrust for large institutions and regulations which influenced his writing throughout his career, and strengthened his anarchist beliefs.&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bishop, Jr |first1=James |title=Epitaph for a Desert Anarchist; The Life and Legacy of Edward Abbey |date=1994 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=0684804395 |edition=1st Touchstone |url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=pXSC0AnpzLkC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to the United States, Abbey took advantage of the [[G.I. Bill]] to attend the [[University of New Mexico]], where he received a B.A. in philosophy and English in 1951, and a [[master's degree]] in philosophy in 1956.&lt;ref name="peterson-2003-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ronald-1982/&gt;{{RP|247}}&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt; During his time in college, Abbey supported himself by working at a variety of odd jobs, including being a newspaper reporter and [[bartending]] in [[Taos, New Mexico]].

During this time he had few male friends but had intimate relationships with a number of women. Shortly before getting his bachelor's degree, Abbey married his first wife, Jean Schmechal (another UNM student).&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt;{{RP|88-89}}

While an undergraduate, Abbey was the editor of a student newspaper in which he published an article titled "Some Implications of Anarchy". A cover quotation (from [[Voltaire]] of the article, "ironically attributed to [[Louisa May Alcott]]", stated: "Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest." University officials seized all of the copies of the issue and removed Abbey from the editorship of the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Scheese, Don|title=Nature writing: the pastoral impulse in America|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-93889-1|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6gLPRqD0NR4C&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receiving his honorable discharge papers, Abbey sent them back to the department with the words "Return to Sender". The [[FBI]] took note and added a note to his file which was opened in 1947 when Edward Abbey committed an act of civil disobedience; he posted a letter while in college urging people to rid themselves of their [[draft card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vault.fbi.gov/Edward%20Abbey|title=Edward Abbey|publisher=vault.fbi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbey was on the FBI's watch-list ever since then and was watched throughout his life. In 1952 Abbey wrote a letter against the draft in times of peace, and again the FBI took notice writing, "Edward Abbey is against war and military." Throughout Abbey's life the FBI took notes building a profile on Abbey, observing his movements, and interviewing many people who knew him. Towards the later part  of his life Abbey learned of the FBI's interest in him and said, "I'd be insulted if they weren't watching me."&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt;

After graduating, Schmechal and Abbey traveled together to [[Edinburgh, Scotland]],&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt; where Abbey spent a year at [[Edinburgh University]] as a [[Fulbright scholar]].&lt;ref name=Ronald-1982/&gt;{{RP|247}}&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt; During this time, Abbey and Schmechal separated and ended their marriage.&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt; In 1951, Abbey began an affair with Rita Deanin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Peterson, David|author=Abbey, Edward|title=Confessions of a barbarian: selections from the journals of Edward Abbey|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|year=2003|isbn=978-1-55566-287-5|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRueIqU-kSIC&amp;pg=PA126}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1952 would become his second wife after he and Schmechal divorced. Deanin and Abbey had two children, Joshua N. Abbey and Aaron Paul Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Macrae, John|title=The Serpents of Paradise: A Reader|publisher=Macmillan|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8050-3133-1|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zU4yQmhETbQC&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbey's [[master's thesis]] explored [[anarchism]] and the [[morality of violence]], asking the two questions: "To what extent is the current [[Anarchism and violence|association between anarchism and violence]] warranted?" and "In so far as the association is a valid one, what arguments have the anarchists presented, explicitly or implicitly, to justify the use of violence?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Phillipon, Daniel J.|chapter=Toward Ecotopia: Edward Abbey and Earth First!|title=Conserving Words: How American Nature Writers Shaped the Environmental Movement|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8203-2759-4|pages=225–226|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMB7Sr0UGxUC&amp;pg=PA225}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his master's degree, Abbey spent 1957 at [[Stanford University]] on a [[Wallace Stegner Creative Writing Fellowship]].&lt;ref name=Ronald-1982/&gt;{{RP|247}}

==Work for National Park Service==
[[File:Double O Arch-Arches NP-Utah.jpg|thumb|right|Abbey spent time as a park ranger at what became [[Arches National Park]] near [[Moab, Utah]]]]
In 1956 and 1957, Abbey worked as a seasonal [[Park ranger|ranger]] for the [[United States National Park Service]] at [[Arches National Monument]] (now a national park), near the town of [[Moab, Utah]]. Abbey held the position from April to September each year, during which time he maintained trails, greeted visitors, and collected campground fees. He lived in a house trailer that had been provided to him by the Park Service, as well as in a [[Ramada (shelter)|ramada]] that he built himself. During his stay at Arches, Abbey accumulated a large volume of notes and sketches which later formed the basis of his first non-fiction work, ''[[Desert Solitaire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Scheese, Don|chapter=Desert Solitaire: Counter-Friction to the Machine in the Garden|editors=Glotfelty, Cheryl &amp; Fromm, Harold|title=The ecocriticism reader: landmarks in literary ecology|publisher=University of Georgia Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8203-1781-6|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJj4RlFKWCoC&amp;pg=PA305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbey's second son Aaron was born in 1959, in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Peterson, David|title=Postcards from Ed: dispatches and salvos from an American iconoclast|publisher=Milkweed Editions|year=2006|isbn=978-1-57131-284-6|page=277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb1lAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s Abbey worked as a seasonal park ranger at [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument]], on the border of Arizona and Mexico. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1961, the movie version of his second novel, ''[[The Brave Cowboy]],'' with screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]], was being shot on location in New Mexico by [[Kirk Douglas]] who had purchased the novel's screen rights and was producing and starring in the film, released in 1962 as ''[[Lonely Are the Brave]]''. Douglas once said that when Abbey visited the film set, he looked and talked so much like Douglas' friend [[Gary Cooper]] that Douglas was disconcerted. Nonetheless, over 25 years later when Abbey died, Douglas wrote that he had "never met" Abbey.&lt;ref name="Cox NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Alex|title=The fretful Birth of the New Western|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/movies/kirk-douglass-film-lonely-are-the-brave.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=29 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1981, Abbey's third novel, ''[[Fire on the Mountain (Abbey novel)|Fire on the Mountain]],'' was also adapted into a TV movie by the same title.&lt;ref name="Cox NYTimes" /&gt;

On October 16, 1965, Abbey married Judy Pepper, who accompanied him as a seasonal park ranger in the [[Florida]] [[Everglades]] and then as a fire lookout in [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]].&lt;ref name=Loeffler-2002&gt;{{cite book|author=Loeffler, Jack|title=Adventures with Ed: A Portrait of Abbey|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8263-2388-0|edition=Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=woIQqklgU58C&amp;pg=PA86}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|86-87}} Judy was separated from Abbey for extended periods of time while she attended the [[University of Arizona]] to earn her master's degree. During this time, Abbey had relations with other women—something that Judy gradually became aware of, causing their marriage to suffer.&lt;ref name=Loeffler-2002 /&gt;{{RP|92}} On August 8, 1968 Pepper gave birth to a daughter, Susannah "Susie" Mildred Abbey. Ed purchased the family a home in [[Sabino Canyon]], outside of [[Tucson]].&lt;ref name=Loeffler-2002 /&gt;{{RP|94}} Judy died of [[leukemia]] on July 11, 1970, an event that crushed Abbey, causing him to go into "bouts of depression and loneliness" for years. It was to Judy that he dedicated his book ''[[Black Sun (Abbey novel)|Black Sun]]''. However, the book was not an autobiographical novel about his relationship with Judy. Rather, it was a story about a woman with whom Abbey had an affair in 1963. Abbey finished the first draft of ''Black Sun'' in 1968, two years before Judy died, and it was "a bone of contention in their marriage."&lt;ref name=Pozza-2006&gt;{{cite book|author=Pozza, David M.|title=Bedrock and Paradox; The Literary Landscape of Edward Abbey|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2006|isbn=0820463302|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ng_aL0prm9cC&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|72–73}}&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt;{{RP|155}}

''Desert Solitaire'', Abbey's fourth book and first non-fiction work, was published in 1968. In it, he describes his stay in the canyonlands of southeastern Utah from 1956-1957.&lt;ref name=Pozza-2006/&gt;{{RP|13}} ''Desert Solitaire'' is regarded as one of the finest [[Nature Writing|nature narratives]] in American literature, and has been compared to [[Aldo Leopold]]'s ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]''{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} and Thoreau's ''[[Walden]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Olson, Ted|chapter="In Search of a More Human Nature": Wendell Berry's Revision of Thoreau's Experiment|editor=Schneider, Richard J.|title=Thoreau's sense of place: essays in American environmental writing|publisher=University of Iowa Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-87745-708-4|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQ7tX6h6SwAC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Abbey vividly describes the physical landscapes of southern Utah and delights in his isolation as a back country park ranger, recounting adventures in the nearby canyon country and mountains. He also attacks what he terms the "industrial tourism" and resulting development in the national parks ("national parking lots"), rails against the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and comments on various other subjects. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In 1973, Abbey married his fourth wife Renee Downing. However, Abbey was always gone so they divorced after four years of marriage.&lt;ref name="Scheese, Donald 2011"&gt;Scheese, Donald.

==Later life==
Abbey met his fifth and final wife, Clarke Cartwright, in 1978,&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt;{{RP|68}} and married her in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Oakes, Elizabeth H.|chapter=Abbey, Edward|title=American Authors|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8160-5158-8|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Lb0zPJcYOwC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had two children, Rebecca Claire Abbey and Benjamin C. Abbey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abbeyweb.net/bio/genealogy.html "Genealogy data"], ''AbbeyWeb''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, Abbey went back to the University of Arizona to teach courses in creative writing and hospitality management. During this time, he continued working on his book ''[[The Fool's Progress|Fool's Progress]]''.&lt;ref name="Loeffler-2002" /&gt;{{RP|180}}

In July 1987, Abbey went to the Earth First! Rendezvous at the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. While there, he was involved in a heated debate with an [[anarchist communist]] group known as Alien Nation, over his stated view that America should be closed to all immigration.&lt;ref name=Lee-1995&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee, Martha Frances|title=Earth first!

Abbey was extremely offended and demanded a public apology, stating that he was neither racist nor a supporter of terrorism. All three of those Bookchin labelled "racist" opposed [[illegal immigration into the United States]], contending that population growth would cause further harm to the environment. Regarding the accusation of "eco-terrorism", Abbey responded that the tactics he supported were trying to defend against the terrorism he felt was committed by government and industry against living beings and the environment.&lt;ref name="Loeffler-2002" /&gt;{{RP|260}}

==Death and burial==
{{quote box
|quote=One final paragraph of advice: &lt;nowiki&gt;[...]&lt;/nowiki&gt; It is not enough to fight for the land; it is even more important to enjoy it. While you can. While it's still here.

So get out there and hunt and fish and mess around with your friends, ramble out yonder and explore the forests, climb the mountains, bag the peaks, run the rivers, breathe deep of that yet sweet and lucid air, sit quietly for a while and contemplate the precious stillness, the lovely, mysterious, and awesome space.

Enjoy yourselves, keep your brain in your head and your head firmly attached to the body, the body active and alive, and I promise you this much; I promise you this one sweet victory over our enemies, over those desk-bound men and women with their hearts in a safe deposit box, and their eyes hypnotized by desk calculators. I promise you this; You will outlive the bastards.

Abbey died on March 14, 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trimble, Stephen|chapter=Epilogue: Remembering Edward Abbey|title=Words from the land: encounters with natural history writing|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87417-264-5|page=390|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9lS0g1VA94C&amp;pg=PA390}}&lt;/ref&gt; aged 62, in his home in [[Tucson, Arizona]]. His death was due to complications from surgery; he suffered four days of esophageal hemorrhaging, due to [[esophageal varices]], which is a recurrent problem with one group of veins.&lt;ref name="Mongillo-2001" /&gt;{{RP|4}} Showing his sense of humor, he left a message for anyone who asked about his final words: "No comment." Abbey also left instructions on what to do with his remains: Abbey wanted his body transported in the bed of a pickup truck and wished to be buried as soon as possible. He did not want to be embalmed or placed in a [[coffin]]. Instead, he preferred to be placed inside of an old sleeping bag and requested that his friends disregard all state laws concerning burial. "I want my body to help fertilize the growth of a cactus or cliff rose or sagebrush or tree," said the message. For his funeral, Abbey stated, "No formal speeches desired, though the deceased will not interfere if someone feels the urge. But keep it all simple and brief." He requested gunfire and bagpipe music, a cheerful and raucous wake, "&lt;nowiki&gt;[a]&lt;/nowiki&gt;nd a flood of beer and booze! Lots of singing, dancing, talking, hollering, laughing, and lovemaking."&lt;ref name="Mongillo-2001" /&gt;{{RP|4}}&lt;ref&gt;[[David Quammen|Quammen, David]], "Bagpipes for Ed", ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', April 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 [[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]' article described how his friends honored his request:
{{quote|The last time Ed smiled was when I told him where he was going to be buried," says [[Doug Peacock]], an environmental crusader in Edward Abbey's inner circle. On March 14, 1989, the day Abbey died from esophageal bleeding at 62, Peacock, along with his friend Jack Loeffler, his father-in-law Tom Cartwright, and his brother-in-law Steve Prescott, wrapped Abbey's body in his blue sleeping bag, packed it with dry ice, and loaded Cactus Ed into Loeffler's Chevy pickup. After stopping at a liquor store in Tucson for five cases of beer, and some whiskey to pour on the grave, they drove off into the desert. The men searched for the right spot the entire next day and finally turned down a long rutted road, drove to the end, and began digging. That night they buried Ed and toasted the life of America's prickliest and most outspoken environmentalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Daley, Jason|title=Forever Wild|work=Outside|date=September 30, 2003|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/Forever-Wild.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Abbey's body was buried in the [[Cabeza Prieta Wilderness|Cabeza Prieta Desert]] in [[Pima County, Arizona]], where "you'll never find it."

In late March, about 200 friends of Abbey's gathered near the [[Saguaro National Monument]] near Tucson and held the wake he requested. A second, much larger wake was held in May, just outside his beloved [[Arches National Park]], with such notables as [[Terry Tempest Williams]] and [[Wendell Berry]] speaking.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Abbey is survived by two daughters, Susannah and Rebecca, and three sons, Joshua, Aaron, and Benjamin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abbeyweb.net/bio/genealogy.html&lt;/ref&gt;
He also has a nephew, David Abbey.

==Literature==
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:The-monkey-wrench-gang.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' was one of Abbey's better-known books (cover of 10th anniversary edition, 1985), and was an inspiration for radical environmental groups, such as [[Earth First!]]]] --&gt;
Abbey's literary influences included [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[A. B. Guthrie, Jr.]].&lt;ref name="Bishop-1994"/&gt;{{RP|221-222}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McClintock, James I.|title=Nature's kindred spirits: Aldo Leopold, Joseph Wood Krutch, Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard, and Gary Snyder|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-299-14174-5|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqTNLkOsmxUC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often compared to authors like Thoreau or Aldo Leopold, Abbey did not wish to be known as a [[nature writer]], saying that he didn't understand "why so many want to read about the world out-of-doors, when it's more interesting simply to go for a walk into the heart of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McClintock, James I.|chapter=Edward Abbey: "An Earthiest"|title=Nature's kindred spirits: Aldo Leopold, Joseph Wood Krutch, Edward Abbey, Annie Dillard, and Gary Snyder|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-299-14174-5|pages=67–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tqTNLkOsmxUC&amp;pg=PA67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme that most interested Abbey was that of the struggle for personal liberty against the totalitarian techno-industrial state, with wilderness being the backdrop in which this struggle took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Payne, Daniel G.|chapter=Monkeywrenching, Environmental Extremism, and the Problematical Edward Abbey|title=Voices in the wilderness: American nature writing and environmental politics|publisher=UPNE|year=1996|isbn=978-0-87451-752-1|pages=156–157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NV2Ol3NfXMC&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Abbey's writing criticizes the park services and American society for its reliance on motor vehicles and technology. He wanted to preserve the wilderness as a refuge for humans and believed that modernization was making us forget what was truly important in life.&lt;ref name="Scheese, Donald 2011"/&gt;

Regarding his writing style, Abbey states: "I write in a deliberately provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I have no desire to simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's hard for me to stay serious for more than half a page at a time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Trimble, Stephen|chapter=Introduction|title=Words from the land: encounters with natural history writing|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-87417-264-5|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9lS0g1VA94C&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moore, Brian L.|title=Ecology and literature: ecocentric personification from antiquity to the twenty-first century|publisher=Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=978-0-230-60669-2|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eG2jcnPbvKQC&amp;pg=PA174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbey's abrasiveness, opposition to [[anthropocentrism]], and outspoken writings made him the object of much controversy. [[Agrarianism|Agrarian]] author [[Wendell Berry]] claimed that Abbey was regularly criticized by mainstream environmental groups because Abbey often advocated controversial positions that were very different from those which environmentalists were commonly expected to hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Nelson, Barney|title=The wild and the domestic: animal representation, ecocriticism, and western American literature|publisher=University of Nevada Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-87417-347-5|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=id1-9GF7mz0C&amp;pg=PA92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbey has also drawn criticism for what some regard as his [[racism|racist]] and [[sexism|sexist]] views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.utne.com/environment/1751.aspx#axzz328DY4CGi|title=Was Edward Abbey Racist and Sexist?|last=Goetzman|first=Keith|work=Utne Reader|date=July 30, 2009|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay called "Immigration and Liberal Taboos", collected in his 1988 book ''One Life at a Time, Please'', Abbey expressed his [[opposition to immigration]] ("legal or illegal, from any source") into the United States: "(I)t occurs to some of us that perhaps ever-continuing industrial and population growth is ''not'' the true road to human happiness, that simple gross quantitative increase of this kind creates only more pain, dislocation, confusion and misery. In which case it might be wise for us as American citizens to consider calling a halt to the mass influx of even more millions of hungry, ignorant, unskilled, and culturally-morally-generically impoverished people. At least until we have brought our own affairs into order. Especially when these uninvited millions bring with them an alien mode of life which—let us be honest about this—is not appealing to the majority of Americans. Why not? Because we prefer democratic government, for one thing; because we still hope for an open, spacious, uncrowded, and beautiful—yes, beautiful!—society, for another. The alternative, in the squalor, cruelty, and corruption of Latin America, is plain for all to see."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Abbey | first=Edward | title=One Life at a Time, Please | location=New York | publisher=Henry Holt and Company | page=43 | date=1988 | isbn=0-805-00602-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often stated that Abbey's works played a significant role in precipitating the creation of [[Earth First!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Taylor, Bron|chapter=Resacralizing Earth: Pagan Environmentalism and the Restoration of Turtle Island|editors=Chidester, David &amp; Linenthal, Edward Tabor|title=American sacred space|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-253-21006-7|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-C9pugPeqhMC&amp;pg=PA105}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Monkey Wrench Gang'' inspired environmentalists frustrated with mainstream environmentalist groups and what they saw as unacceptable compromises. [[Earth First!]] was formed as a result in 1980, advocating eco-sabotage or "[[monkeywrenching]]." Although Abbey never officially joined the group, he became associated with many of its members, and occasionally wrote for the organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Peterson, David|title=Postcards From Ed: Dispatches and Salvos from an American Iconoclast|year=2006|publisher=(publisher?)|page={{page needed|date=January 2011}}|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4586">'''Ferroelectret'''s also known as '''piezoelectret'''s, are thin films of [[polymer foam]]s, exhibiting [[piezoelectric]] and [[pyroelectric]] properties after electric charging.  Ferroelectret foams usually consist of a cellular polymer structure filled with air. Polymer-air composites are elastically soft due to their high air content as well as due to the size and shape of the polymer walls. Their elastically soft composite structure is one essential key for the working principle of ferroelectrets, besides the permanent trapping of electric charges inside the polymer voids. The elastic properties allow large deformations of the electrically charged voids. However, the composite structure can also possibly limit the stability and consequently the range of applications.&lt;ref&gt;A. Mellinger, M. Wegener, W. Wirges, R. Mallepally and R. Gerhard-Multhaupt:''Thermal and Temporal Stability of Ferroelectret Films Made from Cellular Polypropylene/Air Composites'', ''Ferroelectrics'', Volume 331, Number 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;189–199(11), 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==

The most common effect related to ferroelectrets is the direct and inverse piezoelectricity, but in these materials, the effect occurs in a way different from the respective effect in [[ferroelectric polymers]]. In ferroelectric polymers, a stress in the 3-direction mainly decreases the distance between the molecular chains, due to the relatively weak van der Waals and electrostatic interactions between chains in comparison to the strong covalent bonds within the chain. The thickness decrease thus results in an increase of the dipole density and thus in an increase of the charges on the electrodes, yielding a negative d33 coefficient from dipole-density (or secondary) piezoelectricity. In cellular polymers (ferroelectrets), stress in the 3-direction also decreases the thickness of the sample. The thickness decrease occurs dominantly across the voids, the macroscopic dipole moments decrease, and so do the electrode charges, yielding a positive d33 (intrinsic or direct (quasi-)piezoelectricity).&lt;ref&gt;M. Lindner, H. Hoislbauer, R. Schwödiauer, S. Bauer-Gogonea and S. Bauer:''Charged Cellular Polymers with ‘‘Ferroelectretic’’Behavior'', ''IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation'', Volume 11, Number 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;255–263; April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Hillenbrand and G.M. Sessler, ''High-sensitivity piezoelectric microphones based on stacked cellular polymer films (L)'', J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 116 (6), December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New features==

In recent years, alternatives to the cellular-foam ferroelectrets were developed. In the new polymer systems, the required cavities are formed by means of e.g. stamps, templates, laser cutting, etc. Thermo-forming of layer systems from electret films led to thermally more stable ferroelectrets.&lt;ref&gt;R.A.C.

[[File:Haboob Ransom Canyon Texas 2009.jpg|thumb|right|425px|A haboob moves across the [[Llano Estacado]] toward [[Yellow House Canyon]], near the residential community of [[Ransom Canyon, Texas]] (18 June 2009)]]

A '''haboob''' ({{lang-ar|هَبوب|lit=blasting/drifting|translit=habūb}}) is a type of intense [[dust storm]] carried on an atmospheric [[gravity current]], also known as a [[weather front]].  Haboobs occur regularly in [[arid|dry land area]] regions throughout the world.

== Description ==

During thunderstorm formation, winds move in a direction opposite to the storm's travel, and they move from all directions into the thunderstorm. When the storm collapses and begins to release precipitation, wind directions reverse, gusting outward from the storm and generally gusting the strongest in the direction of the storm's travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/qj.49706327111|title=Haboobs and instability in the sudan|year=1937|last1=Farquharson|first1=J.

When this downdraft of cold air, or [[downburst]], reaches the ground, it blows dry, loose silt and clay (collectively, dust) up from the desert, creating a wall of sediment that precedes the storm cloud. This wall of dust can be up to {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and several kilometers in elevation. At their strongest, haboob winds often travel at {{convert|35|–|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, and they may approach with little or no warning. Often rain does not appear at ground level as it evaporates in the hot, dry air (a phenomenon known as [[virga]]). The evaporation cools the rushing air even further and accelerates it.  Occasionally, when the rain does persist, it can contain a considerable quantity of dust. Severe cases are called ''mud storms''. Eye and respiratory system protection is advisable for anyone who must be outside during a haboob. Moving to shelter is highly advised during a strong event.

== Occurrence ==

=== Middle East ===

Haboobs have been observed in the [[Sahara desert]] (typically [[Sudan]], where they were named and described), as well as across the [[Arabian Peninsula]], throughout [[Kuwait]], and in the most arid regions of [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1002/qj.49705121305|title=Haboobs|year=1925|last1=Sutton|first1=L.

African haboobs result from the northward summer shift of the inter-tropical front into [[North Africa]], bringing moisture from the [[Gulf of Guinea]].

=== Australia ===

Haboobs in Australia may be frequently associated with [[cold front]]s. The deserts of [[Central Australia]], especially near [[Alice Springs]], are particularly prone to haboobs, with sand and debris reaching several kilometers into the sky and leaving up to {{convert|30|cm|ft|0}} of sand in the haboob's path.

=== North America ===
{{seealso|North American Monsoon}}
As with haboobs in the Middle East, haboob occurrences in North America are often created by the collapse of a thunderstorm. This is a local or mesoscale event, and at times of extreme drought they can originate in agricultural regions.  Some of the most famous dust storms of the Dust Bowl and similar conditions later were in fact synoptic scale events typically generated by a strong cold frontal passage, with 14 April 1935, 9–11 May 1934, 19 February 1954, and 11 November 1911 being particularly vivid examples.

The arid and semiarid regions of [[North America]]—in fact, any dry region—may experience haboobs. In North America, the most common terms for these events are either [[dust storm]] or sandstorm.  In the U.S., they frequently occur in the deserts of [[Arizona]], including around the cities of [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1175/1520-0477(1972)053&lt;0930:AAH&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1972|volume=53|issue=10|pages=930–935|title=An American Haboob|last1=Idso|first1=S.

People often see '''hidden faces''' in things.  Depending on the circumstances, this is referred to as [[pareidolia]], the perception or recognition of a specific pattern or form in something essentially different.  It is thus also a kind of [[optical illusion]].  When an artist notices that two different things have a similar appearance, and draws or paints a picture making this similarity evident he makes images with double meanings. Many of these images are hidden faces or hidden skulls.

These illusionistic pictures present the viewer with a mental choice of two interpretations: head or landscape, head or objects, head or architecture, etc. Both of them are valid, but the viewer sees only one of them and very often he cannot see both interpretations simultaneously.

There are everyday examples of hidden faces, they are "chance images" including faces in the clouds, figures of the [[Rorschach Test]] and the [[Man in the Moon]]. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote about them in his notebook: "If you look at walls that are stained or made of different kinds of stones you can think you see in them certain picturesque views of mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, broad valleys, and hills of different shapes. You can also find in them battles and rapidly moving figures, strange faces and costumes, as well as an infinite number of things." [[Francois and Jean Robert]] collected and published a lot of photos of "chance faces".{{clear}}

The Mannerist master at the 16th-century imperial Habsburg courts of Vienna and Prague, [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] of [[Milan]] was probably the best known artist for creating extraordinary hidden faces.  He arranged flowers, vegetables, fruits, shells, scallops and other animals, books and different things on the canvas in such a way that the whole collection of objects formed a portrait. His series of The Four Seasons seems to be the first use of this approach and technique. Arcimboldo's composite heads were celebrated and imitated by his contemporaries but they were relatively forgotten until participants in the twentieth-century art movements rediscovered them, bringing them to the attention of art historians. He is considered as forerunner of [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Some other famous [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] artists created hidden faces:{{cn|date=October 2018}}
*[[Leonardo da Vinci]]
*[[Albrecht Dürer]]
*[[Tobias Stimmer]]
*[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]
*[[Matthäus Merian]]
*[[Anna Maria Sibylla Merian]]
*[[Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder]]
*[[Wenzel Hollar]]
*[[Josse de Momper]]

[[Salvador Dalí]] was fascinated by the technique of Arcimboldo and his paranoia-critical method was influenced by the [[Mannerist]] painter. For Dalí the Arcimboldo effect was form of self concealment as well as this exhibitionist painter seemed, all throughout his life of constant posturing, to hide his [[real self]] behind the gaudy externals of his behaviour. Larvatus prodeo, "I wear a mask," he could have said with Descartes and he used this quotation from the French philosopher for the epigraph of his novel ''Hidden Faces''.{{cn|date=October 2018}} Probably his most famous "hidden face" is [[Voltaire]] in his oil painting: "Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire".
Other [[Surrealist]] painters rediscovered the technique of hidden faces in the first part of 20th century: 
*[[Max Ernst]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}
*[[René Magritte]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[Istvan Orosz]] tries to combine the technique of [[anamorphosis]] with the hidden faces. 
Anamorphosis is used for those works of art that were made as distorted and unrecognizable through clever geometrical constructions. But when viewed from a certain point, or through a reflecting object placed upon it, the hidden image appears in its true shape, that is, it goes through retransformation. 
Orosz made experiments with anamorphoses not only in resurrecting the old technique but to improve and develop it. Instead of having a meaningless distorted image, his intent is to bring sense to the basic anamorphic picture, giving it meaning in itself with its second reading being revealed by viewing it from a different viewpoint such as looking at it through a special mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |title=Anamorphosis with double meanings: landscape and portrait of Jules Verne in the mirror cylinder |publisher=gallery-diabolus.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927070312/http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/Verne00.jpg |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ambiguous layers coming up by this approach make use of the connection or contrast of the two images within the same picture being independent from each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery-diabolus.com/gallery/upload/utisz/shakespeareszinhaz.jpg |title=Anamorphosis with double meanings: a theatre and portrait of William Shakespeare.

There are many other contemporary works using hidden faces:

*[[Sandro del Prete]]{{cn|date=October 2018}}

'''Lacus Mortis''', [[Latin]] for "Lake of Death", is a plain of [[basalt]]ic [[lava]] flows in the northeastern part of the [[Moon]]. It lies just to the south of the elongated [[Mare Frigoris]], being separated by a slender arm of rugged ground. To the south is the [[Lacus Somniorum]], separated from
this mare by the joined craters [[Plana (crater)|Plana]] and [[Mason (crater)|Mason]], and a strip of uneven surface.

Located prominently just to the east of the midpoint of this feature is the crater [[Bürg (crater)|Bürg]]. The western part of the Lacus Mortis contains an extensive system of criss-crossing [[rille]]s collectively designated Rimae Bürg.

The selenographic [[coordinate]]s of the Lacus Mortis are 45.0° N, 27.2° E, and it has a diameter of 151&amp;nbsp;km.

In March 2014 [[Astrobotic Technology]] announced Lacus Mortis will be the target destination for its first moon mission as part of the [[Google Lunar X Prize]] competition. Their intention is to land next to a pit located in the Lacus Mortis plain then circumnavigate the pit with a rover.

'''Lake Meke''' ({{lang-tr|Meke Gölü}}) is a [[crater lake]] 
composed of two nested lakes located in [[Konya Province]], central Turkey. It is a registered [[List of natural monuments of Turkey|natural monument of the country]] and a [[List of Ramsar sites in Turkey|Ramsar site]].

Lake Meke is located in [[Karapınar]] district of Konya Province. It is {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from Karapınar, and {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the [[Konya]]-[[Adana]] highway {{TUR-D|330}} {{European route E|981}}.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

It was formed by the flooding of the [[Volcanic crater|crater]] of an [[extinct volcano]], which took shape about 4 million years ago when the volcano erupted.{{Citation needed|reason=Interesting formation; would be good to have citation|date=March 2017}} About 9,000 years ago, a second eruption formed another [[volcanic cone]] inside the lake with a [[maar]]. Lake Meke now consists of two lakes with various islets. It is {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide with a depth of {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The inner lake inside the {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}}-high volcanic cone is {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, and contains [[saline water]]. The volcanic cone island resisted erosion by the harsh weather conditions due to its massive material, and has retained its form for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt;

==Protected areas==
Lake Meke was declared a first grade [[protected area]] in 1989. It was registered as a natural monument in 1998.&lt;ref name="tsa1"/&gt; On June 21, 2005, the lake and its surrounding area was declared a [[Ramsar site]] because of its international importance for wildfowl.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tsa2"/&gt;

==Declining water level==
A scientist from [[Selçuk University]] in Konya stated in 2009 that the lake had nearly dried up. He stated that the reason behind this was the uncontrolled extraction of water for agricultural [[irrigation]] and [[overdrafting]].&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; In 2012, it was reported that the lake's capacity had decreased by about 60% within the last twenty years and that there was a risk that it would dry out completely.
In many sections of the lake, the water was becoming increasingly saline and [[crystallization]] was occurring.&lt;ref name="v1"/&gt; A drought season in 2014 caused a lowering of the [[groundwater]] level which was responsible for the further drying out of the lake to an extent of almost 99%. The remaining water body was turned red by the large quantity of [[microorganism]]s present in the [[brackish water]].&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt; Nearly a hundred species of bird which were previously seen at the lake, had by 2015 moved elsewhere.&lt;ref name="s1"/&gt;

[[Pakistan]] is one of the most seismically active countries in the world, being crossed by several major faults. As a result, earthquakes in Pakistan occur often and are destructive.

==Geology==
{{main|List of faults in Pakistan|Geology of Pakistan}}
Pakistan geologically overlaps both the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[Indian Plate|Indian]] [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]], the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] provinces lie on the southern edge of the [[Eurasian plate]] on the [[Iranian Plateau]]. [[Sindh]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Azad Kashmir|Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] provinces lie on the north-western edge of the Indian plate in [[South Asia]]. Hence this region is prone to violent [[earthquake]]s, as the two tectonic plates collide.

The '''Ma Butte Formation''' is a [[formation (stratigraphy)|stratigraphic]] unit of [[Early Cretaceous]] ([[Albian]]) age in the [[Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin|Western Canada Sedimentary Basin]].&lt;ref name=Mossop19&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ags.aer.ca/reports/atlas-of-the-western-canada-sedimentary-basin.htm|title=The Geological Atlas of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, Chapter 19: Cretaceous Mannville Group of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin|author=Mossop, G.D. and Shetsen, I. (compilers), Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists and Alberta Geological Survey|year=1994|accessdate=2016-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named for Ma Butte, a mountain north of [[Coleman, Alberta]], by J.R. McLean in 1980.&lt;ref name =McLean /&gt; It is present in the foothills of southwestern Alberta and it contains [[paleobotany|plant fossils]].&lt;ref name =McLean /&gt;&lt;ref name=Glass&gt;Glass, D.J.

==Stratigraphy and lithology==
The Ma Butte Formation is a unit of the [[Blairmore Group]]. It consists primarily of fine-grained [[sandstone]]s interbedded with [[siltstone]]s and [[mudstone]]s. Some coarser grained sandstones and [[conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] beds are also present. Beds of [[bentonite]] and [[tuff]] increase upward toward the contact with the overlying [[Crowsnest Formation]]. The sandstones of the Ma Butte Formation are [[quartz|quartzose]], in contrast with the [[feldspar|feldspathic sandstones]] of the underlying [[Beaver Mines Formation]].&lt;ref name =McLean /&gt;&lt;ref name= Glass /&gt;

==Distribution and thickness==
The Ma Butte Formation is present in the southern foothills of Alberta as far north as the [[Red Deer River]]. It has a maximum reported thickness of {{convert|132|m|ft|-1}} near the [[Bow River]].&lt;ref name=Glass /&gt;

==Environment of deposition and paleontology==
The sediments of the Ma Butte Formation were derived from erosion of mountain ranges to the west, transported eastward by river systems, and deposited in a variety of floodplain environments. They include [[angiosperm|angiosperm (flowering plant)]] [[paleobotany|fossils]], in contrast to the underlying Beaver Mines Formation. This marks the first appearance of angiosperms in this area.&lt;ref name =McLean /&gt;
 
==Relationship to other units==
The Ma Butte Formation is also known as the Mill Creek Formation. It [[unconformity|disconformably]] overlies the Beaver Mines Formation. It is conformably overlain by the Crowsnest Formation in the south and the contact between the two is gradational. It is disconformably overlain by the [[Blackstone Formation]] in the north, and it is correlative with the [[Bow Island Formation]] to the east.&lt;ref name= Glass /&gt;

The '''Madagascar ericoid thickets''' is a [[montane grasslands and shrublands|montane shrubland]] [[ecoregion]], found at higher altitudes on [[Madagascar]]'s four major mountains.

==Geography==

The ecoregion covers the area above 1800 m elevation on (from north to south) [[Tsaratanana Massif|Tsaratanana]] (2,876 m), [[Marojejy]] (2,133 m), [[Ankaratra]] (2,643 m), and [[Andringitra Massif]] (2,658 m). The ericoid thickets are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Madagascar subhumid forests]] ecoregion. The total area of the ecoregion is {{convert|1,300|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. On Tsaratanana the thickets are higher up, starting above 2,500m. There are smaller areas of thicket in [[Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve]] in the north and [[Andohahela National Park]] to the south.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-ericoid-thickets"/&gt;

==Flora==

The ericoid thickets are characterised by shrubs of the flowering plant families [[Asteraceae]], [[Ericaceae]], [[Podocarpaceae]], [[Rhamnaceae]] and [[Rubiaceae]]. They include a large number of endemic plants, many of whose closest relatives live in [[South Africa]] and the highlands of [[East Africa]]. Andringitra alone is home to 150 vascular endemics, including 25 species of [[orchid]].&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-ericoid-thickets"/&gt;

==Fauna==

These high points of Madagascar are home to less diverse animal life than on the lower slopes, but with a high proportion of endemics. The area was not thoroughly researched until the 1990s. There are at least ten species of endemic and near-endemic reptiles including the dwarf gecko ''[[Lygodactylus arnoulti]]''.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-ericoid-thickets"/&gt;

==Threats and preservation==

The highlands are vulnerable to fire and to conversion to cattle pasture, although Tsaratanana, Andringitra and Marojejy are all protected areas.&lt;ref name="Crowley2004-ericoid-thickets"/&gt;

"'''Majorcan cartographic school'''" is the term coined by historians to refer to the collection of predominantly [[Jew]]ish [[cartographer]]s, [[cosmographer]]s and [[navigational instrument]]-makers and some [[Christian]] associates that flourished in [[Majorca]] in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries until [[Alhambra Decree|the expulsion of the Jews]]. The label is usually inclusive of those who worked in [[Catalonia]]. The Majorcan school is frequently contrasted with the contemporary [[Italian cartography school]].

== Origins ==
The island of [[Majorca]], the largest of the [[Balearic islands]] in the western [[Mediterranean]], had a long history of seafaring. Muslim and Jewish merchants participated in extensive trade across the Mediterranean Sea with [[Italy]], [[Egypt]] and [[Tunisia]], and in the 14th century their commerce entered into the Atlantic, reaching as far as [[Kingdom of England|England]] and the [[Low Countries]].  Ruled as an independent Muslim kingdom through much of the Early Middle Ages, Majorca only came under Christian rule in 1231, albeit retaining its independence as the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] until 1344, when it was permanently annexed to the [[Crown of Aragon]]. This coincided with a period of Aragonese expansionism across the Mediterranean to [[Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and Greece ([[Duchy of Athens|Athens]] and [[Duchy of Neopatria|Neopatria]]), in which Majorcan nautical, cartographic and mercantile expertise was often called upon.  Majorcan merchants and seafarers spearheaded the attempt by the Aragonese crown to seize the newly discovered [[Canary Island]]s in the Atlantic from the 1340s to the 1360s.

Majorcan cosmographers and cartographers experimented and developed their own cartographic techniques.  According to some scholars (e.g. Nordenskiold), the Majorcans were responsible for the invention (c. 1300) of the "normal [[portolan chart]]".  The portolan was a realistic, detailed nautical chart, gridded by a [[rhumbline network]] with [[compass]] lines that could be used to deduce exact sailing directions between any two points.

Portolan charts, which appeared rather suddenly after 1300, constitute a sharp departure from all earlier maps.  Unlike the circular ''[[mappa mundi]]'' of Christian academic tradition, the portolan was oriented towards the north, and focused on a realistic depiction of geographic distances with a degree of accuracy that is astounding, even by modern standards.  Historians speculate that the portolan was constructed from the first-hand information of mariners and merchants, possibly assisted by [[astronomers]], and were geared for navigational use, in particular the plotting by compass of navigational routes.

Both Majorca and [[Genoa]] have laid claim for the invention of the portolan chart, and it is unlikely this will ever be resolved.  Few charts have survived to the modern day.  The ''[[Carta Pisana]]'' portolan chart, made at the end of the 13th century (1275–1300), is the oldest surviving [[nautical chart]].&lt;ref name="Riddle"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aczel|first=Amir D.|title=The riddle of the compass: the invention that changed the world|publisher=Harcourt Books|location=Orlando|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFcNHc6lu24C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=%22carta+pisana%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carta%20pisana%22|isbn=978-0-15-600753-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest extant ones, from the first half of the 14th century, seem to have been constructed by Genoese cartographers, with Majorcan charts making their appearance only in the latter half of the century. As a result, many historians have argued that the Majorcan cartography derived from the Genoese, citing the mysterious figure of [[Angelino Dulcert]], possibly a Genoese immigrant working in Majorca in the 1330s, as the key intermediary in the transmission.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Caraci, 1959.  More extreme claims were articulated earlier by Magnaghi (1909), who attempts to appropriate not only Dulcert, but Soler, Rosell and others, into the Italian pantheon.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, some scholars have embraced the hypothesis first forwarded by [[Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld|A.E. Nordenskiöld]], that the surviving charts are misleading, that the earliest Genoese maps were just faithful copies of a conjectured prototype (now lost), composed around 1300 by an unknown [[Majorca]]n cosmographer, possibly with the involvement of [[Ramon Llull]].&lt;ref&gt;Nordenskiöld (1896, 1897).&lt;/ref&gt; An intermediary position acknowledges Genoese priority, but insists the Majorcan school had an autonomous origin, at best "inspired" (but not derived) from the Genoese.&lt;ref&gt;Winter (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent research tends to lean towards the first interpretation, but at the same time curbing some of the more extreme Italian claims and recognizing distinctively Majorcan development.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Pujades (2007); Campbell (1987; 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Majorcan style ==
[[File:Europe Mediterranean Catalan Atlas.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|300px|A part of the Catalan Atlas that was created by Majorca's cartographer Abraham Cresques]]
Regardless of the exact origin, historians agree that the Majorcans developed their own distinctive style or "school" of portolan cartography, which can be distinguished from the "Italian school".  Both Italian and Majorcan portolan charts focus on the same geographic area, what is sometimes called the "Normal Portolan": the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] coast up to the environs of [[Flanders]] - in short, the area frequently travelled by contemporary Mediterranean merchants and sailors.  As time and knowledge progressed, some cartographers would stretch the geographic boundaries of the normal portolan to include a larger swathe of Atlantic ocean, including many [[Atlantic islands]] (real and mythical), a longer stretch of the [[west Africa]]n coast to the south, the [[Baltic Sea]] in the north and the [[Caspian Sea]] in the east.  Nonetheless, the central focus on the Mediterranean remained throughout and the scale rarely changed.

The distinction between the Majorcan and Italian school is one of style rather than range.  Italian portolan charts were sparse and restrained, strictly focused on coastal detail, with the inland areas left largely or wholly empty, and the charts largely bereft of illustrations.

The Majorcan style, its beginnings already decipherable in the 1339 chart of [[Angelino Dulcert]], and finding its epitome in the [[Catalan Atlas]] of 1375 (attributed to Majorcan cartographer [[Abraham Cresques]]), contained a lot more inland detail and was replete with rich colorful illustrations, depicting cities, mountain ranges, rivers and some miniature people.  Among the quintessential features replicated in almost all Majorcan charts:
* scattered notes and labels in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]
* the [[Red Sea]] painted red
* the [[Atlas Mountains]] depicted as a palm tree
* the [[Alps]] as a chicken's foot
* the [[Tagus]] as a shepherd's crook, with the curve wrapping around [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].
* the [[Danube]] as a chain of links or hillocks.
* [[Bohemia]] as a horseshoe 
* the Canary island of [[Lanzarote]] colored with a Genoese shield (red cross on white).
* the island of [[Rhodes]] also colored with a shield with a cross.
* the striped shield of the [[Crown of Aragon]] replicated as often as possible, including covering the island of [[Majorca]] itself.
* a [[compass rose]] somewhere on the map, with the [[Pole Star]] set on the north.&lt;ref&gt;Later Italian school maps began to include a compass rose, but placed a [[circumflex]] "hat" (^) as the northmark. Portuguese maps (from 1504) used a [[fleur-de-lis]] as the northmark. See Winter (1947:p.25)&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the miniature people routinely found in many Majorcan maps are depictions of the traders on the [[Silk Road]] and the [[trans-Saharan trade|trans-Saharan route]], the [[Mansa (title)|Emperor]] of [[Mali Empire|Mali]] seated on a gold mine and the ship of [[Jaume Ferrer]].

Although the Italian school largely adhered to its sparse style, some later Italian cartographers, such as the [[Pizzigani brothers]] and [[Battista Beccario]] toyed with Majorcan themes, and introduced some of their features into their own maps.

Although some historians like to distinguish the Italian maps as "nautical" and the Majorcan maps as "nautico-geographic", it is important to note that the Majorcan portolans did not sacrifice the essential nautical function of their portolans.  Lift the entertaining illustrations, and the Majorcan maps are as nautically detailed and serviceable as the Italian.

== Members ==

Major members of the Majorcan school of cartography include:

* [[Angelino Dulcert]] (fl. 1339) - possibly a Genoese immigrant.
* [[Abraham Cresques]] (fl. 1375)
* [[Jehuda Cresques]] ("Jaume Riba"/"Jacobus Ribes")
* [[Haym ibn Risch]] ("Joan de Vallsecha")
* [[Guillem Soler]] (fl. 1380s)
* [[Mecia de Viladestes]] (fl. 1410s)
* [[Jacomé of Majorca]] (1420s?) - moved to Portugal
* [[Gabriel de Vallseca]] (fl.1430s-40s)
* [[Pere Rosell]] (fl.1460s)
* [[Jaume Bertran]] (fl. 1480s).

Unlike in Italy, where the crafts of instrument-making and cartography were distinct, most of the Majorcan cartographers also worked as makers of [[navigational instrument|nautical instruments]] - often appearing in civic records, as both master map-maker and ''bruixoler'' ("compass-maker").  Some were also amateur or professional [[cosmographer]]s, with expertise in [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]], frequently inserting astronomical [[calendar]]s in their atlases.

Most members of the Majorcan school (with the exception of Soler) were [[Jews]], whether practicing or [[conversos]].  As a result, the school suffered heavily and eventually expired with the extension of force-conversion, expulsions and the [[Spanish Inquisition]] into the realms of the Crown of Aragon in the late 15th century.

The production of [[medieval]] [[Portolan chart]]s can be divided in two major schools: the [[Italy|Italian]] and the Catalan. Italian medieval cartographers came mostly from [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]]. [[Catalan chart]]s were made in Majorca and [[Barcelona]]. Beside these two major schools, some maps were made in [[Portugal]], but no examples survive.&lt;ref name=" History of Cartography " /&gt;

The inhabitants of Majorca were great navigators and cartographers. Their geographical knowledge was earned from their own experience and developed in a multicultural atmosphere. Muslim and Jewish merchants participated in extensive trade with Egypt and Tunisia, and in the 14th century they started doing business with [[England]] and [[Netherlands]].  These groups were not limited by the rules imposed by the Christian framework, and their maps were way ahead of their time.  Professor Gerald Crone, who wrote books on medieval mapping, said of these cartographers, they "...threw off the bounds of tradition and anticipated the achievements of the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]]".  The maps they made were prized by the princes and rulers of the Spanish mainland and other countries.  The maps made in Majorca were easy to recognize by their brightly colored illustrations of significant geographical features and portraits of foreign rulers.&lt;ref name="newberry library"/&gt;
 
The first known Majorcan map was made by [[Angelino Dulcert]] in 1339.&lt;ref name=" History of Cartography " /&gt;  Even in this early work, all the distinguishing features of the Majorcan Cartographic School were present.  Dulcert made precise, colorful drawings that showed all the topographical details including rivers, lakes, mountains, etc.  The notes written in [[Latin]] described the map.&lt;ref name=" The Majorcan Cartographic School " /&gt;

The most famous cartographers from the Majorcan school were Jews.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Contribution To Civilization"/&gt;

==Catalan Atlas and Abraham and Jehuda Cresques==
[[File:Caravane Marco Polo.jpg|Marco Polo's caravan from Catalan Atlas|250px|thumb]]
[[Abraham Cresques]] also known as, Cresques the Jew, was appointed as a Master of Maps and [[Compass]]es by [[John I of Aragon]].  The money he got for his appointment was used to build baths for Jews in [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]].
In 1374 and 1375 Abraham and his son [[Jehuda Cresques|Jehuda]] worked on a special order.
John I of Aragon advised the authorities that he needed to get a map, which would show the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the Atlantic coast and the ocean itself.  The map they made got the name [[Catalan Atlas]], and it is the most important [[Catalan language|Catalan]] map of the medieval period.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Contribution To Civilization" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The late medieval age of crisis and renewal, 1300-1500" /&gt;
The first two leaves, forming the oriental portion of the Catalan Atlas, illustrate numerous religious references as well as a synthesis of medieval mappae mundi (Jerusalem located close to the center) and the travel literature of the time, notably [[Marco Polo]]'s ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Book of Marvels and the Travels]]'', and ''Voyage of [[Sir John Mandeville]]''. Many Indian and Chinese cities can be identified.  The explanatory texts report customs described by [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name="The Majorcan Cartographic School"/&gt;  Cresques, who knew [[Arabic]], also used the travel narratives of Moroccan explorer [[Ibn Battuta]]. [[Mecca]] has a blue dome and shows Muslim prayer. The text next to the image is:
{{quote|In this town is the shrine of Mohammed the Prophet of the Saracens, who come here on pilgrimages from every country. And they say that, having seen something so precious, they are no longer worthy of seeing anything more at all, and they blind themselves in honor of Mohammed."&lt;ref name="newberry library"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Catalan Atlas"/&gt;}}

While the areas under Muslim control were marked with domes, Jerusalem was surrounded by tales from Old and New Testaments like the [[Garden of Eden]], the [[crucifixion]], [[Noah's Ark]] and others.

The image of the caravan is accompanied by Marco Polo's travel account:
{{quote|You must know that those who wish to cross this desert remain and lodge for one whole week in a town named Lop, where they and their beasts can rest. Then they lay in all the provisions they need for seven months.&lt;ref name="The Catalan Atlas details"/&gt;}}

A Catalan Atlas was requested by [[Charles VI of France]], even though he expelled all the Jews from France in 1394.

The Catalan Atlas is located now in [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].  A few other Cresques maps were mentioned in inventories from Spain and France in late 1387.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Contribution To Civilization"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The late medieval age of crisis and renewal, 1300-1500"/&gt;

Jehuda Cresques continued his father's traditions. He was forced to convert to Christianity in 1391. His new name was Jacobus Ribes. He was called "lo Jueu buscoler" (the map Jew), or "el jueu de les bruixoles" (the compass Jew).  Jehuda was ordered to move to Barcelona, where he continued his work, as a court cartographer.  Later, he was invited to Portugal by [[Henry the Navigator]], but his maps were still made in Catalan (Majorca) traditions, and that's why he was called "Mestre Jacome de Malhorca".&lt;ref name="The Jewish Contribution To Civilization"/&gt; He was the first director of famous Nautical observatory at [[Sagres, Portugal|Sagres]] [[Portuguese Age of Discovery#Portuguese nautical science|at the age of discovery]].&lt;ref name="The Jewish Contribution To Civilization"/&gt;

==Other Jewish cartographers==

Another famous Jewish cartographer was Haym ibn Risch. He was forced to convert to Christianity and took the name Juan de Vallsecha. He was probably the father of Gabriel Vallsecha, author of yet another famous mapamundi, one later used by [[Amerigo Vespucci]].  Gabriel also produced a very accurate maps of [[Black Sea]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]].&lt;ref name="Planets, Potions, and Parchments: Scientifica Hebraica from the Dead Sea Scrolls to the Eighteenth Century"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewish topographies: visions of space, traditions of place "/&gt;  Another Jewish cartographer was Mecia de Vildestes. An outstanding map by Vildestes dated 1413 is proudly featured at the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris.

Anti-Jewish persecutions brought the end to the famous school of cartography at Majorca.&lt;ref name="The Jewish Contribution To Civilization"/&gt;

[[Greece]] is characterized by an extremely fragmented, rugged [[landscape]] hosting a great diversity of [[ecosystems]] and an outstanding [[biodiversity]]. Almost 5% of its extensive [[coastline]] consists of [[ecology|ecologically sensitive]] [[wetland]]s. Two thirds of the total population live no further than 2&amp;nbsp;km from the coast and most of the important urban centers are coastal, while almost all of the tourist infrastructure is divided among [[Greek Islands|islands]] and the coastal mainland.

==Greek climate==
Greece's [[climate]] is divided into three classes: A [[Mediterranean climate]] features mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Temperatures rarely reach extremes, although snowfalls do occur occasionally even in [[Athens]], [[Cyclades]] or [[Crete]] during the winter. An [[alpine climate]] is found primarily in Western Greece (Epirus, Central Greece, [[Thessaly]], Western [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] as well as central parts of the [[Peloponnese]] like Achaea, Arkadia and parts of Lakonia where the Alpine range pass by). A [[temperate climate]] is found in Central and Eastern [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] as well as in [[Thrace]] at places like [[Komotini]], [[Xanthi]] and northern [[Evros (regional unit)|Evros]]; with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers.

==History==
Such climatic and [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]], along with the rich [[flora]] and [[fauna]] that comes with it, made the need for the creation of [[national park]]s obvious as early as 1937, when the government of [[Ioannis Metaxas]],  first issued a law that established [[national park]]s in Greece. In 1938 the first national park in Greece was established, the [[Mount Olympus|Mount Olympus National Park]], followed by the immediate creation of the [[Mount Parnassus|Parnassos National Park]].

The number of Greek national parks has grown ever since to a full number of ten:

==Layout ==
Each national park consists of a core and the area surrounding it. According to [[Greek law (Hellenic Republic)|Greek Law]] the core cannot be smaller than {{convert|15000000|m2|mi2}}, with the exception of marine national parks. The surrounding area must be larger than, or at least equal to, the size of the core.

In the core of the national park, only [[scientific research]], mild [[recreation]]al activities, and the acquiring of environment related information are permitted. The creation of menageries, [[fish farm]]s, the building of roads, [[outpost (civilian)|outpost]]s, [[camping]] and [[hiking]] infrastructures, along with [[woodcutting]] infrastructures and [[pasture]]s are permitted in the surrounding area of the national park.

[[File:NinetyEastRidge.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The Ninety East Ridge at the centre of the picture and the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]] on the upper left side]]
The '''Ninety East Ridge''' (also rendered as '''Ninetyeast Ridge''', '''90E Ridge''' or '''90°E Ridge''') is a linear structure on the [[Indian Ocean]] floor named for its near-parallel strike along the [[90th meridian east|90th meridian]] at the center of the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. It is approximately {{convert|5000|km|mi}} in length and can be traced topographically from the [[Bay of Bengal]] southward towards the [[Southeast Indian Ridge]] (SEIR), though the feature continues to the north where it is hidden beneath the sediments of the [[Bengal Fan]]. The ridge extends between latitudes [[33rd parallel south|33°S]] and [[17th parallel north|17°N]] and has an average width of 200&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Ramana&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ramana |first=M.V. |author2=T.

The ridge divides the Indian Ocean into the West and East Indian Ocean. The northeastern side is named the [[Wharton Basin]] and ceases at the western end of the [[Diamantina Fracture Zone]] which passes to the east and almost to the Australian continent.&lt;ref name="Stow"&gt;Stow, D. A. V. (2006) ''Oceans : an illustrated reference'' Chicago : University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|0-226-77664-6}} - page 127 for map of Indian Ocean and ridges&lt;/ref&gt;

The ridge is primarily composed of [[Tholeiitic basalt|Ocean Island Tholeiites]] (OIT), a subset of [[basalt]] which increase in age from approximately 43.2 ± 0.5 Ma in the south to 81.8 ± 2.6 Ma in the north&lt;ref name="Weis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weis |first=D. |title=The Influence of Mantle Plumes in Generation of Indian Oceanic Crust |journal=Geophysical Monograph |volume=70 |issue= |pages=57–89 |year=1993 |doi=10.1029/gm070p0057|display-authors=etal |bibcode=1992GMS....70...57W}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a more recent analysis using modern [[Argon–argon dating|Ar–Ar techniques]] is currently pending{{Update after|2018|7|21}} publication.  This age progression has led geologists to theorize that a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] beneath the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] created the ridge as the plate has moved northward in the late [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]].  This theory is supported by a detailed analysis of the chemistry of the [[Kerguelen Plateau]] and [[Rajmahal Traps]], which together, geologists believe, represent the [[flood basalt]]s erupted at the initiation of volcanism at the [[Kerguelen hotspot]] which was then sheared in two as the Indian subcontinent moved northward.&lt;ref name="Weis" /&gt; However, the existence of so-called deep [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] is currently a topic of debate in the geologic community, with a few geochemists favoring an alternative hypothesis which postulates a much shallower origin for [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] volcanism.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal |last=King |first=S.

The ridge has been surveyed several times in the past, including several times by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Program]] (DSDP). In 2007, the [[RV Roger Revelle]] collected bathymetric, magnetic and seismic data together with dredge samples from nine sites along the ridge as part of an [[Integrated Ocean Drilling Program]] (IODP) site survey intended to examine the hotspot hypothesis for the ridge.&lt;ref name=KNOX06RR&gt;{{cite web|title=Seismic Project Information KNOX06RR Ninetyeast Ridge IODP Survey|url=http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/sdc/cruise.php?cruiseIn=knox06rr|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been assumed that the India and Australia are on a single tectonic plate for at least the last 32 million years. However, considering the high level of large earthquakes in the Ninety East Ridge area and the evidence of deformation in the central Indian Ocean, it is more appropriate to consider the deformed region in the central Indian Ocean as a broad plate boundary zone separating the Indian Plate and the Australian Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Photomultiplier tubes''' ('''photomultipliers''' or '''PMTs''' for short), members of the class of [[vacuum tube]]s, and more specifically vacuum [[phototube]]s, are extremely sensitive detectors of light in the [[ultraviolet]], [[visible light|visible]], and [[near-infrared]] ranges of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times (i.e., 160 [[decibel|dB]]), in multiple [[dynode]] stages, enabling (for example) individual [[photons]] to be detected when the incident [[flux]] of light is low.

[[File:Dynodes.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Dynodes inside a photomultiplier tube]]
The combination of high [[Gain (electronics)|gain]], low [[Noise (electronics)|noise]], high frequency response or, equivalently, ultra-fast response, and large area of collection has maintained photomultipliers an essential place in [[Spectroscopy|low light level spectroscopy]], [[confocal microscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy]], [[Fluorescence spectroscopy|fluorescence spectroscopy]], [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]], [[astronomy]], medical [[diagnostics]] including [[blood tests]], [[medical imaging]], motion picture film scanning ([[telecine]]), [[Barrage jamming|radar jamming]], and high-end image scanners known as [[drum scanner]]s. Elements of photomultiplier technology, when integrated differently, are the basis of [[night vision device]]s. Research that analyzes [[light scattering]], such as the study of [[polymers]] in solution, often uses a laser and a PMT to collect the scattered light data.

[[Semiconductor device]]s, particularly [[avalanche photodiode]]s, are alternatives to photomultipliers; however, photomultipliers are uniquely well-suited for applications requiring low-noise, high-sensitivity detection of light that is imperfectly [[collimated light|collimated]].

==Structure and operating principles==
[[File:PhotoMultiplierTubeAndScintillator.svg|thumb|500px|left|Fig.1: Schematic of a photomultiplier tube coupled to a [[scintillator]]. This arrangement is for detection of [[gamma rays]].]]
[[File:PMT Voltage Divider.jpg|thumb|500px|left|Fig. 2: Typical photomultiplier voltage divider circuit using negative high voltage.]]

Photomultipliers are typically constructed with an evacuated glass housing (using an extremely tight and durable [[Glass-to-metal_seal|glass-to-metal]] seal like other [[Vacuum_tube|vacuum tubes]]), containing a [[photocathode]], several [[dynode]]s, and an [[anode]]. Incident [[photons]] strike the [[photocathode]] material, which is usually a thin [[vacuum deposition|vapor-deposited]] conducting layer on the inside of the entry window of the device. [[Electron]]s are ejected from the surface as a consequence of the [[photoelectric effect]]. These electrons are directed by the focusing [[electrode]] toward the [[electron multiplier]], where electrons are multiplied by the process of [[secondary emission]].
 
The electron multiplier consists of a number of electrodes called ''dynodes''. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3&amp;nbsp;eV for "blue" photons, minus the [[work function]] of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.)  The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100&amp;nbsp;eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 5&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; electrons.  This last stage is called the [[anode]]. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.

The necessary distribution of voltage along the series of dynodes is created by a voltage divider chain, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the example, the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000V, while the anode is very close to ground potential. The capacitors across the final few dynodes act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the dynodes while electron avalanches propagate through the tube. Many variations of design are used in practice; the design shown is merely illustrative.

There are two common photomultiplier orientations, the ''head-on'' or ''end-on'' (transmission mode) design, as shown above, where light enters the flat, circular top of the tube and passes the photocathode, and the ''side-on'' design (reflection mode), where light enters at a particular spot on the side of the tube, and impacts on an opaque photocathode. The side-on design is used, for instance, in the [[#Electrostatic photomultipliers (1937–present)|type 931]], the first mass-produced PMT. Besides the different photocathode materials, performance is also affected by the transmission of the [[Photomultiplier#Window_materials|window material]] that the light passes through, and by the arrangement of the dynodes. Many photomultiplier models are available having various combinations of these, and other, design variables. The manufacturers manuals  provide the information needed to choose an appropriate design for a particular application.

==History==
The invention of the photomultiplier is predicated upon two prior achievements, the separate discoveries of the [[photoelectric effect]] and of [[secondary emission]].

===Photoelectric effect===

The first demonstration of the [[photoelectric effect]] was carried out in 1887 by [[Heinrich Hertz]] using ultraviolet light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Hertz |title=Ueber einen Einfluss des ultravioletten Lichtes auf die electrische Entladung |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=267 |issue=8 |pages=983–1000 |year=1887 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=79SWAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Annalen%20der%20Physik%20und%20Chemie%20hertz%201887&amp;pg=PA983#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |doi=10.1002/andp.18872670827|bibcode = 1887AnP...267..983H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant for practical applications, Elster and Geitel two years later demonstrated the same effect using ''visible'' light striking alkali metals (potassium and sodium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elster|first1=Julius|last2=Geitel|first2=Hans|title=Ueber die Entladung negativ electrischer Körper durch das Sonnen- und Tageslicht|journal=Annalen der Physik|volume=274|page=497|year=1889|doi=10.1002/andp.18892741202|bibcode = 1889AnP...274..497E|issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of [[caesium]], another [[alkali metal]], has permitted the range of sensitive wavelengths to be extended towards longer wavelengths in the red portion of the visible spectrum.

Historically, the photoelectric effect is associated with [[Albert Einstein]], who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of [[quantum mechanics]] in 1905,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=A. Einstein |title=Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt |url=http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf |journal=Annalen der Physik |volume=322 |issue=6 |pages=132–148 |year=1905 |doi=10.1002/andp.19053220607 |bibcode=1905AnP...322..132E |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709180735/http://www.physik.uni-augsburg.de/annalen/history/einstein-papers/1905_17_132-148.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an accomplishment for which Einstein received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize]]. It is worthwhile to note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons is proportional to the frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of ''quanta'', for the first time.

===Secondary emission===

The phenomenon of [[secondary emission]] (the ability of [[electrons]] in a vacuum tube to cause the emission of additional electrons by striking an [[electrode]]) was, at first, limited to purely electronic phenomena and devices (which lacked [[photosensitivity]]). In 1899 the effect was first reported by Villard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pksGCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Secondary+Emission+1899&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ejD3YmKcMc&amp;sig=5jk2lIaSN7vbF0wPJfCtOe9gRIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiI_8yN6N3QAhXNFsAKHSq7AzIQ6AEIJzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Secondary+Emission+1899&amp;f=false|title=Interaction of Atomic Particles with a Solid Surface / Vzaimodeistvie Atomnykh Chastits S Poverkhnost’yu Tverdogo Tela / Взаимодействие Атомных Частиц С Поверхностью Твердого Тела|first=U.

Bruining, Physics and applications of secondary electron emission, (McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc.; 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the newly discovered secondary emission to the amplification of signals was only proposed after [[World War I]] by [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] scientist [[Joseph Slepian]] in a 1919 patent.&lt;ref&gt;J. Slepian, Westinghouse Electric, "Hot Cathode Tube" {{US Patent|1450265}}, Issued April 3, 1923 (Filed 1919)&lt;/ref&gt;

====The race towards a practical electronic television camera====

The ingredients for inventing the photomultiplier were coming together during the 1920s as the pace of vacuum tube technology accelerated. The primary goal for many, if not most, workers was the need for a practical television camera technology. Television had been pursued with primitive prototypes for decades prior to the 1934 introduction of the first practical camera (the [[iconoscope]]). Early prototype television cameras lacked sensitivity. Photomultiplier technology was pursued to enable television camera tubes, such as the iconoscope and (later) the [[orthicon]], to be sensitive enough to be practical. So the stage was set to combine the dual phenomena of [[photoemission]] (i.e., the photoelectric effect) with [[secondary emission]], both of which had already been studied and adequately understood, to create a practical photomultiplier.

====First photomultiplier, single-stage (early 1934)====

The first documented photomultiplier demonstration dates to the early 1934 accomplishments of an RCA group based in Harrison, NJ. Harley Iams and Bernard Salzberg were the first to integrate a photoelectric-effect cathode and single secondary emission amplification stage in a single vacuum envelope and the first to characterize its performance as a photomultiplier with electron amplification gain. These accomplishments were finalized ''prior'' to June 1934 as detailed in the manuscript submitted to [[Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers]] (Proc. IRE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iams|first1=H.|last2=Salzberg|first2=B.|title=The Secondary Emission Phototube|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=23|page=55|year=1935|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1935.227243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The device consisted of a semi-cylindrical [[photocathode]], a secondary emitter mounted on the axis, and a collector grid surrounding the secondary emitter. The tube had a gain of about eight and operated at frequencies well above 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

====Magnetic photomultipliers (mid 1934–1937)====

Higher gains were sought than those available from the early single-stage photomultipliers. However, it is an empirical fact that the yield of secondary electrons is limited in any given secondary emission process, regardless of acceleration voltage. Thus, any single-stage photomultiplier is limited in gain. At the time the maximum first-stage gain that could be achieved was approximately 10 (very significant developments in the 1960s permitted gains above 25 to be reached using negative electron affinity [[dynode]]s). For this reason, multiple-stage photomultipliers, in which the photoelectron yield could be multiplied successively in several stages, were an important goal. The challenge was to cause the photoelectrons to impinge on successively higher-voltage electrodes rather than to travel directly to the highest voltage electrode. Initially this challenge was overcome by using strong magnetic fields to bend the electrons' trajectories. Such a scheme had earlier been conceived by inventor J. Slepian by 1919 (see above). Accordingly, leading international research organizations turned their attention towards improving photomultiplers to achieve higher gain with multiple stages.

In the [[USSR]], RCA-manufactured radio equipment was introduced on a large scale by [[Joseph Stalin]] to construct broadcast networks, and the newly formed All-Union Scientific Research Institute for Television was gearing up a research program in vacuum tubes that was advanced for its time and place. Numerous visits were made by RCA scientific personnel to the [[USSR]] in the 1930s, prior to the [[Cold War]], to instruct the Soviet customers on the capabilities of RCA equipment and to investigate customer needs.&lt;ref&gt;A.B. Magoun [http://www.histech.nl/Shot2004/programma/txt/magoun.asp?file=magoun ''Adding Sight to Sound in Stalin’s Russia: RCA and the Transfer of Television Technology to the Soviet Union''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724154432/http://www.histech.nl/Shot2004/programma/txt/magoun.asp?file=magoun |date=2011-07-24 }}, Society for the History of Technology (SHOT), Amsterdam (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; During one of these visits, in September 1934, RCA's [[Vladimir Zworykin]] was shown the first multiple-dynode photomultiplier, or ''photoelectron multiplier''. This pioneering device was proposed by Leonid A. Kubetsky in 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ru:Большая советская энциклопедия|trans-title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|chapter=Кубецкий Леонид Александрович|trans-chapter=Kubetsky Leonid Aleksandrovich|language=Russian|year=1973|volume=13|edition=3|publisher=Sovetskaya Entsiklopediya|location=Moscow|chapterurl=http://slovari.yandex.ru/~%D0%BA%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B3%D0%B8/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%9A%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B4%20%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he subsequently built in 1934. The device achieved gains of 1000x or more when demonstrated in June 1934. The work was submitted for print publication only two years later, in July 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kubetsky|first1=L.A.|title=Multiple Amplifier|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=25|page=421|year=1937|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1937.229045|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as emphasized in a recent 2006 publication of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubsandorzhiev|first1=B|doi=10.1016/j.nima.2006.05.221|title=On the history of photomultiplier tube invention|year=2006|page=236|volume=567|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment|arxiv=physics/0601159|bibcode = 2006NIMPA.567..236L }}&lt;/ref&gt; which terms it "Kubetsky's Tube." The Soviet device used a magnetic field to confine the secondary electrons and relied on the Ag-O-Cs photocathode which had been demonstrated by General Electric in the 1920s.

By October 1935, [[Zworykin|Vladimir Zworykin]], George Ashmun Morton, and Louis Malter of RCA in Camden, NJ submitted their manuscript describing the first comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of a multiple dynode tube — the device later called a ''photomultiplier''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zworykin|first1=V.K.|last2=Morton|first2=G.A.|last3=Malter|first3=L.|title=The Secondary Emission Multiplier-A New Electronic Device|journal=Proceedings of the IRE|volume=24|page=351|year=1936|doi=10.1109/JRPROC.1936.226435|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; — to Proc. IRE. The RCA prototype photomultipliers also used an Ag-O-Cs ([[silver oxide]]-[[caesium]]) photocathode. They exhibited a peak [[quantum efficiency]] of 0.4% at 800 [[nanometer|nm]].

====Electrostatic photomultipliers (1937–present)====

Whereas these early photomultipliers used the magnetic field principle, electrostatic photomultipliers (with no magnetic field) were demonstrated by [[Jan A. Rajchman|Jan Rajchman]] of RCA Laboratories in Princeton, NJ in the late 1930s and became the standard for all future commercial photomultipliers. The first mass-produced photomultiplier, the Type 931, was of this design and is still commercially produced today.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rajchman and E.W. Pike, RCA Technical Report TR-362, "Electrostatic Focusing in Secondary Emission Multipliers," September 9, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

====Improved photocathodes====

Also in 1936, a much improved photocathode, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb ([[caesium]]-[[antimony]]), was reported by P. Görlich.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Görlich|first1=P.|title=Über zusammengesetzte, durchsichtige Photokathoden|journal=Zeitschrift für Physik|volume=101|page=335|year=1936|doi=10.1007/BF01342330|bibcode = 1936ZPhy..101..335G|issue=5–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The caesium-antimony photocathode had a dramatically improved quantum efficiency of 12% at 400&amp;nbsp;nm, and was used in the first commercially successful photomultipliers manufactured by RCA (i.e., the 931-type) both as a photocathode and as a secondary-emitting material for the [[dynode]]s. Different photocathodes provided differing spectral responses.

===Spectral response of photocathodes===
In the early 1940s, the [[JEDEC]] (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council), an industry committee on standardization, developed a system of designating spectral responses.&lt;ref&gt;"Relative spectral response data for
photosensitive devices ("S" curves)," JEDEC Publication No. 50, Electronic Industries Association, Engineering Department, 2001 I Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006 (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy included the idea that the product's user need only be concerned about the response of the device rather than how the device may be fabricated. Various combinations of photocathode and window materials were assigned "S-numbers" (spectral numbers) ranging from S-1 through S-40, which are still in use today. For example, S-11 uses the caesium-antimony photocathode with a lime glass window, S-13 uses the same photocathode with a fused silica window, and S-25 uses a so-called "multialkali" photocathode (Na-K-Sb-Cs, or [[sodium]]-[[potassium]]-[[antimony]]-[[caesium]]) that provides extended response in the red portion of the visible light spectrum. No suitable photoemissive surfaces have yet been reported to detect wavelengths longer than approximately 1700 nanometers, which can be approached by a special (InP/InGaAs(Cs)) photocathode.&lt;ref name="Hamamatsu handbook"&gt;{{cite web

===RCA Corporation===
For decades, RCA was responsible for performing the most important work in developing and refining photomultipliers. RCA was also largely responsible for the commercialization of photomultiplers. The company compiled and published an authoritative and widely used ''Photomultiplier Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=RCA Corporation|title=RCA Photomultiplier Manual|date=1970|url=https://archive.org/details/RcaPhotomultiplierManual|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612174929/https://archive.org/details/RcaPhotomultiplierManual|archivedate=2016-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCA provided printed copies free upon request. The handbook, which continues to be made available online at no cost by the successors to RCA, is considered to be an essential reference.

Following a corporate break-up in the late 1980s involving the acquisition of RCA by [[General Electric]] and disposition of the divisions of RCA to numerous third parties, [[RCA]]'s photomultiplier business became an independent company.

===Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility===
The [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] facility was opened by the [[U.S. Navy]] in 1942 and operated by RCA for the manufacture of [[radio tube|radio]] and [[microwave tube]]s. Following [[World War II]], the naval facility was acquired by RCA. ''RCA Lancaster'', as it became known, was the base for development and production of commercial [[television]] products. In subsequent years other products were added, such as [[cathode ray tubes]], photomultiplier tubes, [[motion detection|motion-sensing]] light control switches, and [[closed-circuit television]] systems.

===Burle Industries===
Burle Industries, as a successor to the RCA Corporation, carried the RCA photomultiplier business forward after 1986, based in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania facility. The 1986 acquisition of RCA by [[General Electric]] resulted in the [[divestiture]] of the RCA Lancaster New Products Division. Hence, 45 years after being founded by the U.S. Navy, its management team, led by Erich Burlefinger, purchased the division and in 1987 founded Burle Industries.

In 2005, after eighteen years as an independent enterprise, Burle Industries and a key subsidiary were acquired by Photonis, a European holding company [[Photonis Group]]. Following the acquisition, Photonis was composed of Photonis Netherlands, Photonis France, Photonis USA, and Burle Industries.  Photonis USA operates the former Galileo Corporation Scientific Detector Products Group ([[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]), which had been purchased by Burle Industries in 1999.  The group is known for [[microchannel plate detector]] (MCP) electron multipliers—an integrated micro-vacuum tube version of photomultipliers.  MCPs are used for imaging and scientific applications, including [[night vision device]]s.

On 9 March 2009, Photonis announced that it would cease all production of photomultipliers at both the Lancaster, Pennsylvania and the Brive, France plants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090625052831/http://www.photonis.com/holding/news/press_release_photonis_is_announcing_the_halt_of_its_photomultiplier_activity PHOTONIS will stop its Photomultiplier activity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hamamatsu===
The [[Japan]]-based company [[Hamamatsu Photonics]] (also known as Hamamatsu) has emerged since the 1950s as a leader in the photomultiplier industry. Hamamatsu, in the tradition of RCA, has published its own handbook, which is available without cost on the company's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamamatsu Photonics K. K.|title=PHOTOMULTIPLIER TUBES Basics and Applications|date=2007|url=http://www.edmundoptics.com/techsupport/resource_center/product_docs/manl_pmt.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517153301/http://www.edmundoptics.com/techsupport/resource_center/product_docs/manl_pmt.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamamatsu uses different designations for particular photocathode formulations and introduces modifications to these designations based on Hamamatsu's proprietary research and development.

===Photocathode materials===
The photocathodes can be made of a variety of materials, with different properties. Typically the materials have low [[work function]] and are therefore prone to [[thermionic emission]], causing noise and dark current, especially the materials sensitive in infrared; cooling the photocathode lowers this thermal noise. The most common photocathode materials are&lt;ref name="pmt"&gt;[https://wwwmu.mpp.mpg.de/docs/pmtconstruct.pdf Photomultiplier Tubes. Construction and Operating Characteristics. Connections to External Circuits], Hamamatsu&lt;/ref&gt; Ag-O-Cs (also called S1) transmission-mode, sensitive from 300–1200&amp;nbsp;nm. High dark current; used mainly in near-infrared, with the photocathode cooled; GaAs:Cs, [[caesium]]-[[Activator (phosphor)|activated]] [[gallium arsenide]], flat response from 300 to 850&amp;nbsp;nm, fading towards ultraviolet and to 930&amp;nbsp;nm; InGaAs:Cs, caesium-activated [[indium gallium arsenide]], higher infrared sensitivity than GaAs:Cs, between 900–1000&amp;nbsp;nm much higher [[signal-to-noise ratio]] than Ag-O-Cs; Sb-Cs, (also called S11) caesium-activated [[antimony]], used for reflective mode photocathodes; response range from ultraviolet to visible, widely used; bialkali (Sb-K-Cs, Sb-Rb-Cs), caesium-activated antimony-rubidium or antimony-potassium alloy, similar to Sb:Cs, with higher sensitivity and lower noise. can be used for transmission-mode; favorable response to a NaI:Tl [[scintillator]] flashes makes them widely used in [[gamma spectroscopy]] and radiation detection;  high-temperature bialkali (Na-K-Sb), can operate up to 175&amp;nbsp;°C, used in [[well logging]], low dark current at room temperature; multialkali (Na-K-Sb-Cs), (also called S20), wide spectral response from ultraviolet to near-infrared, special cathode processing can extend range to 930&amp;nbsp;nm, used in broadband [[spectrophotometer]]s; solar-blind (Cs-Te, Cs-I), sensitive to vacuum-UV and ultraviolet, insensitive to visible light and infrared (Cs-Te has cutoff at 320&amp;nbsp;nm, Cs-I at 200&amp;nbsp;nm).

===Window materials===
The windows of the photomultipliers act as wavelength filters; this may be irrelevant if the cutoff wavelengths are outside of the application range or outside of the photocathode sensitivity range, but special care has to be taken for uncommon wavelengths. [[Borosilicate glass]] is commonly used for near-infrared to about 300&amp;nbsp;nm. [[Borosilicate_glass#High-borate_borosilicate_glasses|High borate borosilicate glasses]] exist also in high UV transmission versions with high transmission also at 254 nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schott.com/tubing/english/product_selector/#!/region--all/lang--english/product--8337B/propuvtransp|title=SCHOTT - Glass Tubing Explorer|author=|date=|website=www.schott.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160711121216/http://www.schott.com/tubing/english/product_selector/#!/region--all/lang--english/product--8337B/propuvtransp|archivedate=2016-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass with very low content of [[potassium]] can be used with bialkali photocathodes to lower the background radiation from the [[potassium-40]] isotope. Ultraviolet glass transmits visible and ultraviolet down to 185&amp;nbsp;nm. Used in spectroscopy. Synthetic [[fused quartz|silica]] transmits down to 160&amp;nbsp;nm, absorbs less UV than fused silica. Different thermal expansion than [[kovar]] (and than borosilicate glass that's [[Glass-to-metal_seal|expansion-matched]] to kovar), a graded seal needed between the window and the rest of the tube. The seal is vulnerable to mechanical shocks. [[Magnesium fluoride]] transmits ultraviolet down to 115&amp;nbsp;nm. [[Hygroscopic]], though less than other alkali halides usable for UV windows.

==Usage considerations==
Photomultiplier tubes typically utilize 1000 to 2000 [[volts]] to accelerate electrons within the chain of dynodes. (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage is connected to the cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the [[photocurrent]] to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted "dark current" pulses that may affect the operation.  Voltages are distributed to the dynodes by a resistive [[voltage divider]], although variations such as active designs (with [[transistors]] or [[diode]]s) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or [[rise time]], can be selected to suit varying applications. Some instruments that use photomultipliers have provisions to vary the anode voltage to control the gain of the system.

While powered (energized), photomultipliers must be shielded from ambient light to prevent their destruction through overexcitation. In some applications this protection is accomplished mechanically by electrical interlocks or shutters that protect the tube when the photomultiplier compartment is opened. Another option is to add overcurrent protection in the external circuit, so that when the measured anode current exceeds a safe limit, the high voltage is reduced.

If used in a location with strong [[magnetic field]]s, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or [[mu-metal]]. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be electrically insulated because of the high voltage on it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first dynode are especially sensitive to magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="pmt"/&gt;

==Applications==
Photomultipliers were the first [[electric eye]] devices, being used to measure interruptions in beams of light. Photomultipliers are used in conjunction with [[scintillator]]s to detect [[Ionizing radiation]] by means of hand held and fixed radiation protection instruments, and [[particle radiation]] in physics experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drct.com/probes/HP-265_G-M_pancake_probe.htm|title=HP-265 Pancake G-M Probe|author=|date=|website=www.drct.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photomultipliers are used in research laboratories to measure the intensity and spectrum of light-emitting materials such as [[compound semiconductor]]s and [[quantum dots]]. Photomultipliers are used as the detector in many [[Spectrophotometry|spectrophotometers]]. This allows an instrument design that escapes the [[#High sensitivity applications|thermal noise limit on sensitivity]], and which can therefore substantially increase the dynamic range of the instrument.

Photomultipliers are used in numerous medical equipment designs. For example, [[blood analysis]] devices used by clinical medical laboratories, such as [[Flow cytometry|flow cytometers]], utilize photomultipliers to determine the relative concentration of various components in blood samples, in combination with [[optical filter]]s and [[incandescent lamps]]. An array of photomultipliers is used in a [[gamma camera]]. Photomultipliers are typically used as the detectors in [[flying-spot scanner]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===High-sensitivity applications===
After 50 years, during which [[Solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] electronic components have largely displaced the vacuum tube, the photomultiplier remains a unique and important optoelectronic component. Perhaps its most useful quality is that it acts, electronically, as a nearly perfect [[current source]], owing to the high voltage utilized in extracting the tiny currents associated with weak light signals. There is no [[Johnson noise]] associated with photomultiplier signal currents, even though they are greatly amplified, e.g., by 100 thousand times (i.e., 50&amp;nbsp;dB) or more. The photocurrent still contains [[shot noise]].

Photomultiplier-amplified photocurrents can be electronically amplified by a high-input-impedance electronic amplifier (in the signal path subsequent to the photomultiplier), thus producing appreciable voltages even for nearly infinitesimally small photon fluxes. Photomultipliers offer the best possible opportunity to exceed the Johnson noise for many configurations. The aforementioned refers to measurement of light fluxes that, while small, nonetheless amount to a continuous stream of multiple photons.

For smaller photon fluxes, the photomultiplier can be operated in photon-counting, or [[Geiger counter|Geiger]], mode (see also [[Single-photon avalanche diode]]). In Geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high (using high voltage) that a single photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit. However, owing to the avalanche of current, a reset of the photomultiplier is required. In either case, the photomultiplier can detect individual photons. The drawback, however, is that not every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier, or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the "[[dead time]]" associated with a first photon and never be noticed.

A photomultiplier will produce a small current even without incident photons; this is called the [[Dark current (physics)|''dark current'']]. Photon-counting applications generally demand photomultipliers designed to minimise dark current.

Nonetheless, the ability to detect single photons striking the primary photosensitive surface itself reveals the quantization principle that [[Albert Einstein#Photons and energy quanta|Einstein put forth]]. Photon counting (as it is called) reveals that light, not only being a wave, consists of discrete particles (i.e., [[photon]]s).

== Biography ==

[[Image:Kozhevnikov.PNG|thumb|right|[[Aleksei Kozhevnikov]] was a pioneer of Russian psychiatry and an advocate for humane treatment of the mentally insane. He founded the Moscow Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists in 1890. His name is lent to the eponymous "Kozhevnikov's epilepsy," also known as [[epilepsia partialis continua]].]]

[[Image:Sergey Korsakov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sergei Korsakoff]] was known for his studies on alcoholic psychosis.

[[Image:Serbskiy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Vladimir Serbsky]] was one of the founders of the [[forensic psychiatry]] in Russia. An author of "The Forensic Psychopathology," Serbsky thought delinquency to have no congenital diatheses considering it to be caused by social reasons.]]

=== Early life and education ===

Pyotr Borisovich Gannushkin was born in 1875, in the countryside Novosyolki of the Pronsk District of the [[Ryazan Governorate]] (present-day [[Ryazan Oblast]]) in the [[Russian Empire]]. His father, a responsive and punctual man, was a [[physician]]. His mother, née Mozharova, was of Russian impoverished squireens. She was well-bred and properly educated, fluent in both [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] languages, interested in [[philosophy]], fond of [[music]], [[poetry]], and [[art]]. Furthermore, she was a gregarious and kind-hearted woman.&lt;ref name="Bazhenov"&gt;Баженов Н. Н. История Московского доллгауза. — М., 1909. — С. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerish 01"&gt;Гериш А. Г. Библиографическая хроника профессора П. Б. Ганнушкина // Проблемы бреда, пограничные состояния и вопросы организации психиатрической помощи: Тезисы научной конференции, посвящённой 100-летию со дня рождения проф. П. Б. Ганнушкина (г. Москва, 29–30 июня 1975 г.) / Под общ. ред. М. Ш. Вольфа. — М.: Б. и., 1975. — С. 61–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early years, Gannushkin was educated by his mother. After a while, his family moved to [[Ryazan]], where his father started working in the men's high school. Gannushkin entered that school soon after he had turned 9 years-old. An excellent student, he always was a sociable, honest, and ironically inclined person who disliked severe discipline. During his school years, Gannushkin was involved in the editing of his own home journal.&lt;ref name="Gerish 02"&gt;Гериш А. Г. П. Б. Ганнушкин. — М.: Медицина, 1975. — 64 с.&lt;/ref&gt;

His sister, Maria Borisovna, noted in her memoirs that her brother never told anyone which profession he wanted to choose, but when he turned 13 years old, his keen interest in "[[Personality psychology|personology]]" and human mentality became apparent. At the same time Gannushkin read [[Ivan Sechenov|Sechenov]]'s monograph "Brain Reflexes," which was a successful attempt to describe physiological mechanisms of psychic activity.

=== University years ===

In 1893 Gannushkin had graduated from the high school with the gold medal and entered the department of [[medicine]] of the [[Moscow State University]]. When he was a third-year student, he finally decided to become a psychiatrist being influenced by such university professors as [[Aleksei Kozhevnikov]] and [[Sergei Korsakoff]].

All the students, including Gannushkin, were fascinated by the way Korsakoff interacted with the mentally disabled. He explained that "mental patients should not be regarded as soulless things; instead, they should be considered personalities familiar to everyone who is somehow related to them."&lt;ref name="Zavilyansky"&gt;Завилянський І.

Except for visiting lectures and recitations during his university years, Gannushkin was an orderly who carried out responsibilities of the junior medical staff.&lt;ref name="Zeigarnik"&gt;Зейгарник Б.

=== Academic career ===

Gannushkin graduated from the university in October 1898. He turned down a proposal to become a permanent resident physician, because at that moment it included superintendent's responsibilities. During the period of four years, up to 1902, he had been a non resident of the psychiatric hospital. He spent those years in the outpatient clinic and wrote a variety of scholarly works. For example, in 1901 in the French journal "Medico Psychological Annals" ({{lang-fr|Annales médico-psychologiques}}) he published a monograph subsequently banned in Russia. It was called "Voluptuousness, cruelty and religion" ({{lang-fr|La volupté, la cruauté et la religion}}). In this work, Gannushkin emphasized the fact that religiosity, sexuality, and cruelty were closely related to each other. He illustrated it with the example of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. According to Gannushkin, in many cases religious fanatics demonstrated cruelty, and vice versa, i.e. many cruel people were religious.&lt;ref name="Gannushkin 05"&gt;Gannouchkine P. B. La volupté, la cruauté et la religion // Annales médico-psychologiques. — 1901. — V. 14. — P. 353–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerbikov 01"&gt;Кербиков О. В. Проблема психопатий в историческом освещении. Сообщение третье: Учение о психопатиях в работах П. Б. Ганнушкина // Журнал невропатологии и психиатрии им. С. С. Корсакова. — 1958. — Т. 58, вып. 10. — С. 1253–1258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, at the suggestion of Sukhanov, Serbsky, and [[Grigory Ivanovich Rossolimo|Rossolimo]], Gannushkin became a full-fledged member of the Moscow Society of Neuropathologists and Psychiatrists ({{lang-ru|Московское общество невропатологов и психиатров}}). At the same time he was elected a supernumerary assistant of the psychiatric hospital headed by Serbsky, after Korsakoff's death caused by heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vein |first=Alla |year=2009 |title=Sergey Sergeevich Korsakov (1854–1900) |doi=10.1007/s00415-009-5289-x |journal=J Neurol |volume=256 |issue= |pages=1782–1783 |pmid= |pmc=2758215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sergei Sukhanov, Korsakoff's assistant, was willing to help young physicians by fostering them in word and in deed. Sukhanov and Gannushkin formed friendly relations. Sukhanov was a proponent of nosological approach. A remarkable power of observation was a peculiarity of his nature. Borderline psychiatry, especially psychopathies and psychogenies, was among his main research interests. Due to his penchant for synthesis, Sukhanov noted both scientific and social importance of this problem. He managed to make Gannushkin interested in this issue.

In collaboration with Sukhanov, Gannushkin has published [[Pyotr Gannushkin#Bibliography|six research papers]]. They preferred to study particular mental disorders taken by themselves rather than their mixed types, because they thought that it would contribute to the study of acknowledged diseases, discovery of new mental disorders, and development of psychiatric classification. Sukhanov and Gannushkin distinguished an especial form of obsessions and were the first to show the process when, at least in some cases, obsessions were transforming into [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name="Kannabikh"&gt;Каннабих Ю. В. История психиатрии. — М.: Госмедиз, 1929. — С. 466–468.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 Gannushkin presented his thesis "Paranoia acuta" or "Acute paranoia" ({{lang-ru|Острая паранойя}}), which consisted of an historical sketch of development of the theory of paranoia. The issue description starts off with researches performed by [[Vincenzo Chiarugi]] and [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]]. Then focus of a thesis switches to works by [[Wilhelm Griesinger]], [[Bénédict Morel]], and [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal]]. Subsequently represented are observations made by [[Sergei Korsakoff]], [[Vladimir Serbsky]], [[Emil Kraepelin]], and [[Eugen Bleuler]]. Finally Gannushkin brilliantly describes his own findings related to paranoia.&lt;ref name="Bazhenov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kondrashkova"&gt;Кондрашкова О. В., Вольф М. Ш., Лурия Л. Р. Пётр Борисович Ганнушкин и психиатрическая больница, носящая его имя // Проблемы бреда, пограничные состояния и вопросы организации психиатрической помощи: Тезисы научной конференции, посвящённой 100-летию со дня рождения проф. П. Б. Ганнушкина (г. Москва, 29–30 июня 1975 г.) / Под общ. ред. М. Ш. Вольфа. — М.: Б. и., 1975. — С. 25–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the presentation of his thesis, Gannushkin became a privatdocent (i.e. freelance university lecturer) of the Department of Mental Disorders in the Moscow State University. It was the moment he started lecturing his course called "The Theory of Pathological Characters" ({{lang-ru|Учение о патологических характерах}}).

In 1905 Gannushkin visited postgraduate psychiatry courses at [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]]'s clinic in [[Munich]]. After that he became a proponent of Kraepelin's theory. In 1906 Gannushkin visited St. Anne's Psychiatric Hospital ({{lang-fr|Hôpital Sainte-Anne}}) in [[Paris]], where he familiarized himself with the work of an influential figure in French psychiatry, [[Valentin Magnan]]. In 1908 and 1911 Gannushkin repeatedly visited postgraduate psychiatry courses at Kraepelin's clinic.

In 1911 university autonomy became a breach issue in Russia; it resulted in repressions performed by a [[Tsar]]'s protégé, [[education minister]], [[Lev Kasso]]. In 1911 Gannushkin left the university together with other progressive scientists in protest of the repressions. Before being drafted in the army, namely from 1906 to 1914, he worked as a resident physician in the Moscow Alexeev Psychiatric Hospital ({{lang-ru|Московская Алексеевская психиатрическая больница}}), which is known nowadays as Kashenko Mental Hospital ({{lang-ru|больница имени П. П. Кащенко}}). He was one of the founders of the front-rank scientific journal called "Korsakoff's Journal of Neuropathology and Psychiatry" ({{lang-ru|Журнал невропатологии и психиатрии имени Корсакова}}).

In 1917, after army discharge due to illness, Gannushkin returned in the Moscow Alexeev Psychiatric Hospital. Since 1918 he was a professor in the Department of Psychiatry of the Moscow State University (from 1930 - [[I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University]]) and director at the University Psychiatric Hospital, currently known as S.S. Korsakov Clinic of Psychiatry of I.M. Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy ({{lang-ru|Клиника имени С. С. Корсакова АМН России имени И. М. Сеченова}}).

Gannushkin was one of the first psychiatrists to talk about the schizoid reaction type, somatogenic and psychogenic reactions of [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoids]]. Moreover, in 1927 he discovered the so-called epileptoid reaction type, which is usually characterized by repeated temporary reactions caused by the influence of psychogenic factors and unfavorable situations. This reaction type is expressed by symptoms of dysphoria, i.e. maliciousness combined with anger, anguish, and fear.&lt;ref name="Gannushkin "&gt;Ганнушкин П.Б. Об эпилептоидном типе реакции. Вестник современной медицины, 1927; № 23.- С. 1472–1473.&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, this reaction type is akin to the behavior pattern typical for [[borderline personality disorder]]. As a [[psychotic episode]], such reactions could happen during epidemic [[encephalitis]], cerebral [[atherosclerosis]], and [[Brain damage|brain injury]].

Gannushkin was also involved in experimental research of [[hypnosis]]. He criticized [[Cesare Lombroso|Lombroso's]] theory of crime.&lt;ref name="Galachyan"&gt;Галачьян А. Г. К неопубликованным работам П. Б. Ганнушкина // Ганнушкин П. Б. Избранные труды / Под ред. О. В. Кербикова. — М.: Медицина, 1964. — С. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Gannushkin was interested in [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] ideas, and experimentally used psychoanalytic therapy. His stance on psychoanalysis is outlined in his work called "On Psychotherapy and Psychoanalis" ({{lang-ru|О психотерапии и психоанализе}}).&lt;ref name="Gannushkin 02"&gt;Ганнушкин П. Б. О психотерапии и психоанализе // Ганнушкин П. Б. Избранные труды / Под ред. О. В. Кербикова. — М.: Медицина, 1964. — С. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not a real proponent of [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s theory, Gannushkin did believe that under certain conditions psychoanalytic methods could be used during the treatment process.&lt;ref name="Kerbikov 01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fridman 01"&gt;Фридман Б. Д. П. Б. Ганнушкин в учении о психопатиях // Советская невропатология, психиатрия и психогигиена. — 1933. — Т. 2, вып. 5. — С. 106–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannushkin considered both war and revolution as a "traumatic epidemic" of all the population. He used to emphasize that there was a reciprocal influence between population mentality and social life.&lt;ref name="Banshikov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gannushkin 03"&gt;Ганнушкин П. Б. Острая паранойя (paranoia acuta). Клиническая сторона вопроса. — Диссертация д-ра мед. наук. — М., 1904. — 250 с.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a new form of medical care for people with mental disorders, the system of psychoneurological dispensaries was created under Gannushkin's direction. Moreover, it was he who initiated the development of extramural psychiatric care in Russia. He helped organize a system of nonhospital psychiatric assistance in the USSR and worked out questions dealing with teaching in psychiatry and prevention of mental illness.&lt;ref name="Edelstein 02"&gt;Эдельштейн А. О. Психиатрическая клиника // 175 лет 1-го Московского государственного медицинского института. — М.–Л., 1940. — С. 343–345.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage and children ===

Pyotr Borisovich Gannushkin married Sofia Vladimirovna Gannuskina (née Klumova). They had a son, Alexey Petrovich Gannushkin (1920 - 1974), an aircraft design engineer, USSR State Prize Laureate. Gannushkin's granddaughter, [[Svetlana Gannushkina]] (born 1943), is a mathematician and [[human rights]] activist who was reported to have been a serious contender for the 2010 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8560469.stm |title=
Internet 'in running' for Nobel Peace Prize |author= |date=10 March 2010 |work= |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svetlana Gannushkina worked for many years as a professor of mathematics at the Moscow State University. She is a member of the Council for the Development of Civil Society Institutions and Human Rights under the President of Russia.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/feature-stories/human-rights-defender-russia-svetlana-alekseevna-gannushkina-20081209 |title=Human Rights Defender in Russia: Svetlana Alekseevna Gannushkina |author= |date=9 December 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality characteristics and views on psychiatry ===

Gannushkin was characterized by modesty and diffidence. He disliked [[public speaking]]. When visiting psychiatric conferences, he preferred to stay in the background. Gannushkin was able to open his mind only among his scientific fellows and while lecturing his senior students. He showed himself as an experienced clinician, a proponent of natural science method who considered himself as an enemy of pompous and meretricious declamation.&lt;ref name="Fridman 02"&gt;Фридман Б. Д. П. Б. Ганнушкин как руководитель коллектива // Проблемы бреда, пограничные состояния и вопросы организации психиатрической помощи: Тезисы научной конференции, посвящённой 100-летию со дня рождения проф. П. Б. Ганнушкина (г. Москва, 29–30 июня 1975 г.) / Под общ. ред. М. Ш. Вольфа. — М.: Б. и., 1975. — С. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frumkin 01"&gt;Фрумкин Я. П. Клинико-диагностический метод П. Б. Ганнушкина // Советская невропатология, психиатрия и психогигиена. — 1933. — Т. 2, вып. 5. — С. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannushkin's power of observation was enhanced by his erudition and capability of distinguishing the most useful points in the different monographs and articles. He recorded each new thought and accurately gathered all required materials. His lectures and clinical vignettes were indicative of the fact that he carefully scrutinized and systematized all the research data he was working with.&lt;ref name="Fridman 01"/&gt;

L.A. Prozorov pointed out that "Gannushkin was able to interest young people in research, even if it was rough, search for people, and select research scientists."&lt;ref name="Morozov 01"&gt;Морозов В. М. Учение П. Б. Ганнушкина о малой психиатрии // Журнал невропатологии и психиатрии им. С. С. Корсакова. — 1975. — Т. 75, вып. 4. — С. 586–588.&lt;/ref&gt; While remembering her husband, Sofia Gannushkina said, "Once he decided to do something, he grew fearless."

Throughout his life, Gannushkin did believe that psychiatry is closely connected with social life. From his point of view, a psychiatrist is primarily a community worker. Maybe that is why he made psychopathies his main research subject.
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"We, our generation, do not limit ourselves by psychiatric hospitals. Using the same approach, we are coming into life, coming to schools, barracks, prisons. We are not looking for the demented who need to be hospitalized, but for half-normal people, borderline types, intermediate steps. Borderline psychiatry, minor psychiatry... - here is a motto for our times, an area to which our actions must be directed in the immediate future."&lt;ref name="Gannushkin 03" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Death and influence ===

When Gannushkin was finishing his seminal work called "Manifestations of psychopathies: statics, dynamics, systematic aspects" ({{lang-ru|Клиника психопатий, их статика, динамика, систематика}}), his health quickly deteriorated. After long hesitation he agreed the proposed surgery. The best Russian physicians tried to help him, but he died on February 23, 1933. He managed to read and sign his monograph after proofreading. The book was published after his death.&lt;ref name="Bazhenov" /&gt;

Research papers written by Gannushkin and his followers represent a landmark in the development of the theory of psychopathies in Russia. Among Russian psychiatrists, it was Gannushkin who defined psychopathies (personality disorders) most accurately.&lt;ref name="Edelstein 01"&gt;Эдельштейн А. О. Памяти учителя // Памяти Петра Борисовича Ганнушкина: Труды психиатрической клиники 1-го Московского медицинского института. — М.–Л.: Биомедиз, 1934. — Вып. 4. — С. 5–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannushkin had a lot of followers. It is possible to distinguish three generations of his disciples. The first generation was represented mostly by Gannushkin's colleagues who worked under his direction: D.A. Amenitsky, I.N. Vvedensky, T.A. Geyer, V.A. Grombakh, [[Mikhail Gurevich (psychiatrist)|M.O. Gurevich]], P.M. Zinovyev, E.K. Krasnushkin, L.A. Prozorov, L.M. Rezenstein, M.Y. Serieysky, T.I. Yudin. The second generation consisted of Gannushkin's senior students: B.A. Belousov, A.G. Galachyan, F.F. Detengor, S.G. Zhislin, A.N. Zalmanov, M.Z. Kaplinsky, R.E. Lusternik, N.S. Molodenkov, A.N. Molokhov, N.I. Ozeretsky, D.S. Ozeretskovsky, T.P. Simpson, Y.A. Florenskaya, B.D. Fridman, Y.P. Frumkin, A.O. Edelstein. The third generation included Gannushkin's junior students: A.P. Alexandrova, A.M. Dubinin, O.V. Kerbikov, S.V. Krayts, A.Y. Levinson, D.E. Melekhov, V.M. Morozov, A.I. Ponomoryov, B.A. Famin, P.D. Fridman, Y.D. Shulman. Gannushkin's followers contributed significantly to development of psychiatry in Russia.&lt;ref name="Khoroshko"&gt;Хорошко В. К. Профессор П. Б. Ганнушкин (1875–1933) // Клиническая медицина. — 1933. — Т. 11, № 7–8. — С. 422–423.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shulman"&gt;Шульман Е. Д. Амбулаторный приём П. Б. Ганнушкина // Памяти Петра Борисовича Ганнушкина: Труды психиатрической клиники 1-го Московского медицинского института. — М.–Л.: Биомедиз, 1934. — Вып. 4. — С. 32–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the Scientific-Research Institute of Neuropsychiatric Prophylaxis of People's Commissariat of Health Care (Narkomzdrav) established an annual award n.a. Pyotr Borisovich Gannushkin.&lt;ref name="Yudin 01"&gt;Юдин Т. И. Памяти П. Б. Ганнушкина // Советская психоневрология. — 1933. — № 2. — С. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yudin 02"&gt;Юдин Т. И. П. Б. Ганнушкин и малая психиатрия // Памяти Петра Борисовича Ганнушкина: Труды психиатрической клиники 1-го Московского медицинского института. — М.–Л.: Биомедиз, 1934. — Вып. 4. — С. 22–26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936 Moscow Psychiatric Hospital no.4 was named after Gannushkin ({{lang-ru|Психиатрическая клиническая больница № 4 им. П.Б. Ганнушкина}}). After a while, his memorial museum was created inside this hospital. Furthermore, a river embankment in Moscow was also named in his honor.&lt;ref name="Yudin 03"&gt;Юдин Т. И. Очерки истории отечественной психиатрии — М.: Медгиз, 1951. — С. 323–324; 406–411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edelstein 03"&gt;Edelstein A. In memoriam Peter Gannuschkin // Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten. — 1933. — Bd. 100. — S. 424–426.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interesting that Gannushkin became a prototype of Professor Titanushkin, a character from the famous satirical novel "[[The Little Golden Calf]]" written by two Soviet prose authors, [[Ilf and Petrov]].

== The theory of psychopathies ==

Pyotr Borisovich Gannushkin preferred to break down psychiatry into two main categories: major psychiatry (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.) and minor psychiatry (psychopathies or personality disorders). The theory of psychopathies or the so-called pathological characters is considered to be his main contribution to psychiatry.

In his book "Manifestations of psychopathies: statics, dynamics, systematic aspects," Gannushkin distinguished two types of pathological development - constitutional and situational. In case of situational type, the development of psychopathy is obviously caused by trauma or distress. Its onset is always marked by some serious mental change, after which everything becomes more or less static. Gannushkin pointed out that while statics of psychopathies means actual substance of the subject, dynamics of psychopathies implies types, laws, and development schemes of psychopathies.&lt;ref name="Levinson"&gt;Левинсон А. Я. Неповторимый образ учителя // Проблемы бреда, пограничные состояния и вопросы организации психиатрической помощи: Тезисы научной конференции, посвящённой 100-летию со дня рождения проф. П. Б. Ганнушкина (г. Москва, 29–30 июня 1975 г.) / Под общ. ред. М. Ш. Вольфа. — М.: Б. и., 1975.— С. 53–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be mentioned that Gannushkin did not consider psychopathies to be progredient mental states by opposing them to serious mental disorders causing mental retardation. Gannushkin placed special emphasis on the fact that borderline psychiatry includes a wide range of different transitional steps, transient mental states. He acknowledged that psychopaths (i.e. those with personality disorders) substantially contributed to science, art, and literature.&lt;ref name="Kerbikov 01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lichko"&gt;Личко А. Е. Гражданин своей эпохи (100 лет со дня рождения П. Б. Ганнушкина) // Наука и религия. — 1975. — № 4. — С. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannushkin delineated the three main signs of behavioral pathology underlying psychopathies:

* '''maladaptation'''
* '''ubiquity'''
* '''stability'''

Some elements of Gannushkin's typology were later incorporated into the theory developed by another Russian psychiatrist, [[Andrey Yevgenyevich Lichko]], who was also interested in personality disorders along with their milder forms, the so-called [[Andrey Yevgenyevich Lichko#Accentuations of character|accentuations of character]] ({{lang-ru|акцентуации характера}}).&lt;ref name="Lichko 02"&gt;Личко А. Е. Психопатии и акцентуации характера у подростков. — Речь, 2010. — {{ISBN|978-5-9268-0828-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bibliography==
Taken as a whole, Gannushkin's bibliography includes 3 monographs, 19 articles, 9 introductory notes for monographs and compilation books, and approximately 100 reviews.

[[File:Quicksand warning.jpg|thumb|right|Quicksand and a warning sign about it at a gravel quarry in England]]

'''Quicksand''' is a [[colloid]] [[hydrogel]] consisting of fine [[granular material]] (such as [[sand]], [[silt]] or [[clay]]), and [[water]].

Quicksand forms in saturated loose sand when the sand is suddenly agitated. When water in the sand cannot escape, it creates a liquefied soil that loses strength and cannot support weight. Quicksand can form in standing water or in upwards flowing water (as from an [[Artesian aquifer|artesian spring]]). In the case of upwards flowing water, [[effective stress|seepage forces]] oppose the force of gravity and suspend the soil particles.

The saturated sediment may appear quite solid until a sudden change in pressure or shock initiates liquefaction. This causes the sand to form a suspension and lose strength. The cushioning of water gives quicksand, and other liquefied sediments, a spongy, fluid-like texture. Objects in liquefied sand sink to the level at which the weight of the object is equal to the weight of the displaced soil/water mix and the submerged object floats due to its buoyancy.

[[Soil liquefaction|Liquefaction]] is a special case of quicksand. In this case, sudden [[earthquake]] forces immediately increase the [[pore pressure]] of shallow groundwater. The saturated liquefied soil loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink.

== Properties ==
[[File:Quicksandwarning.JPG|thumb|Quicksand warning sign near [[Lower King, Western Australia|Lower King]] Bridge, Western Australia]]
Quicksand may be found on [[Bank (geography)|riverbanks]], near [[lake]]s, in [[marsh]]es, or near coastal areas.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Quicksand is a [[shear thinning]] [[non-Newtonian fluid]]: when undisturbed, it often appears to be [[phase (matter)|solid]] ("[[gel]]" form), but a minor (less than 1%) change in the [[stress (physics)|stress]] on the quicksand will cause a sudden decrease in its [[viscosity]] ("[[sol (colloid)|sol]]" form). After an initial disturbance—such as a person attempting to walk on it—the water and sand in the quicksand separate and dense regions of sand [[sediment]] form; it is because of the formation of these high [[volume fraction]] regions that the viscosity of the quicksand seems to decrease suddenly. Someone stepping on it will start to sink. To move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient [[pressure]] on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to [[liquefaction|liquefy]] it. The [[force]]s required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of 0.01&amp;nbsp;m/s would require the same amount of force as "that needed to lift a medium-sized car."&lt;ref name="Bonn"&gt;Khaldoun, A., E. Eiser, G. H. Wegdam, and Daniel Bonn. 2005. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7059/full/437635a.html "Rheology: Liquefaction of quicksand under stress."] ''Nature'' 437 (29 Sept.): 635. {{doi|10.1038/437635a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A human is unlikely to sink entirely into quicksand and drown at all due to the higher [[density]] of the fluid (assuming the quicksand is on dry ground and not under water, but even if underwater, sinking is still improbable). Quicksand has a density of about 2 grams per milliliter, whereas the density of the human body is only about 1 gram per milliliter. At that level of density, sinking in quicksand is impossible. Descending about up to the waist is possible, but not any further. Even objects with a higher density than quicksand will float on it—until they move. Aluminum, for example, has a density of about 2.7 grams per milliliter, but a piece of aluminum will float on top of quicksand until motion causes the sand to liquefy.&lt;ref name=Bakalar&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/quicksand-science-why-it-traps-how-to-escape/ |title=Quicksand Science: Why It Traps, How to Escape |first1=Nicholas |last1=Bakalar |publisher=[[National Geographic News]] |date=September 28, 2005 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued or panicked movement, however, may cause a person to sink further in the quicksand. Since it increasingly impairs movement, it can lead to a situation where other factors such as weather exposure, [[dehydration]], [[hypothermia]], [[tide]]s or [[carnivores]] may harm a trapped person.&lt;ref&gt;[[Discovery Channel]]. ''[[MythBusters]]''. Season 2. [[MythBusters (2004 season)#Episode 19 .E2.80.93 .22Killer Quicksand.22|"Killer Quicksand."]] October 20, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to increase viscosity of the fluid, and rotation of the body so as to float in the [[supine position]] (lying horizontally with the face and torso facing up).&lt;ref name=Bakalar/&gt;

==In popular culture==
People falling into (and unrealistically being submerged in) quicksand or a similar substance is a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of [[adventure fiction]], notably movies. According to ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', this gimmick had its heyday in the 1960s, when almost 3%{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} of all films showed someone sinking in clay, mud, or sand. The proliferation of quicksand scenes in movies has given rise to an [[Cyberculture|Internet subculture]] scene dedicated to the topic.&lt;ref name="Engber 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Engber|first=Daniel|title=Terra Infirma: The rise and fall of quicksand.|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2264312/|accessdate=23 August 2010|newspaper=Slate|date=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; American television programs of the 1950s&amp;ndash;1960s likewise portrayed the perils of quicksand in exaggerated, dramatic fashion. In a 1963 episode of the [[western (genre)|Western]] television program ''[[The Rifleman]]'', for example, two teens are portrayed venturing into a swamp and sinking in quicksand up to their necks, frantically yelling for help until rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Tony (Episode #168)|work=The Rifleman|publisher=Levy-Gardner-Laven Productions|url=https://www.therifleman.net/index.php/episodes/?episode=168|year=April 8, 1963|access-date= August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode 5 of Season 9 of the cartoon ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' featured a lengthy scene where two of the main characters fought to free themselves from quicksand.

[[Pete Seeger]]'s song "[[Waist Deep in the Big Muddy]]" mentions someone drowning after getting stuck in quicksand.&lt;ref name=Seeger&gt;{{cite web|last=Seeger |first=Pete |title=How Waist Deep in the Big Muddy Finally Got on Network Television in 1968 |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |work=Pete Seeger Appreciation |publisher=Jim Capaldi |accessdate=2 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805061813/http://www.peteseeger.net/givepeacechance.htm |archivedate=August 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3293">The '''South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of southern [[India]]. It covers the southern portion of the [[Western Ghats]] range and the [[Nilgiri Hills]] between 250 and 1000 meters elevation in [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] states.

==Setting==







The ecoregion has an area of {{convert|23,800|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. It includes the southern ranges of the Western Ghats, including the [[Agastyamalai]] and [[Anamalai]], and the eastward spurs of the [[Nilgiri Hills]] and [[Palani Hills]]. The forests of [[Wayanad]] in northern [[Kerala]] mark the transition to the [[North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests]] to the north. To the west, the [[Malabar Coast moist forests]] ecoregion lies in the coastal strip between the 250 meter contour and the [[Malabar Coast]]. To the east, the ecoregion transitions to the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion in the drier [[rain shadow]] of the Western Ghats. It surrounds the [[South Western Ghats montane rain forests]] ecoregion, which lies above 1000 meters elevation.

==Protected areas==
In 1997, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] identified fourteen protected areas in the ecoregion, with a combined area of approximately 4,960 km², that encompassed 21% of the ecoregion's area. The adjacent protected areas of Bandipur, Nagarhole, Mudumalai, and Wyanad are home to India's largest protected population of elephants, with over 2500 individuals. &lt;ref&gt;Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). ''Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment.'' Island Press; [[Washington, DC]]. pp. 313-315&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other people||Stephen Williams (disambiguation)}}
'''Stephen Williams''' (31 March 1908 - 23 November 1994) was a British radio announcer, presenter and producer, and a pioneer of commercial radio for the UK.

Born in London and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, as a young boy he was already, in his words, a "wireless fanatic": he said, "I was able to listen proudly to the debut of the BBC on 14 November 1922, and from the moment I heard the announcer say "This is 2LO calling, 2LO, the London station of the British Broadcasting Company", I was seized with an ambition to have a job like his."

During his university vacation in 1928 he got a job as announcer on a "broadcasting yacht" sponsored by the Daily Mail newspaper group. This vessel went round the coast of Britain, transmitting music on records and advertisements for the Daily Mail, from just outside territorial waters, an early precursor of the 1960s "pirate radio" ships..

The broadcasting yacht had been the idea of the paper's Circulation and Publicity Director, Valentine Smith, who soon transferred to the Sunday Referee, where he gave Williams a job with the idea of involving the paper in commercial broadcasting. They were soon in contact with Captain [[Leonard F. Plugge]], who was starting the [[International Broadcasting Company]] (IBC).&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Williams, "Pioneering commercial radio the D-I-Y way", ''European Journal of Marketing'', October 1987. {{cite web |url=http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030903160037/http://www.offshoreechos.com/radionormandie/_private/stepheneng.htm |archivedate=2003-09-03 |df= }} {{ISSN|0309-0566}} 
(journal title and date wrongly cited on web page).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1932, Williams was sent to France to join Max Staniforth at the IBC's new Radio Normandy service, broadcasting to the south of England.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Plomley, ''Days Seemed Longer: Early Years of a Broadcaster'', London, 1980, p.123. {{ISBN|0-413-39730-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recordings of two commercials read by Stephen Williams on Radio Normandy in 1932 are said to survive.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Radio For Sale: Sponsored Programming in British Radio during the 1930s", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 1999. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/Street19991.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Williams moved on to a rival company to IBC, Radio Publicity, which started broadcasting to the UK from Radio Paris, then a much more powerful station than Radio Normandy, which rapidly gained a large British audience. But French listeners complained that their most popular station was now too dominated by English programmes, so Radio Publicity turned to the newly created [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], where it was able to gain the sole concession for English programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1933 Williams thus became the first English radio presenter in Luxembourg as well as serving as manager of the station.

Shortly before his death in 1994, Williams gave an interview to Roger Bickerton about his work at Radio Luxembourg which was published in ''The Historic Record and AV Collector'', Issues 39,40 and 41, April, June &amp; October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Street, "Recording Technologies and Strategies for British Radio Transmission Before the 2nd World War", in ''Sound Journal'', Bournemouth University, 2002. [http://www.kent.ac.uk/sdfva/sound-journal/street002.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Luxembourg closed down on the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Stephen Williams resumed his duties there when the station restarted in 1946. He left Luxembourg in 1948, and worked until 1975 as a freelance broadcaster.

When, on 1 January 1992, Radio Luxembourg's English service closed down as a terrestrial radio station, the last words heard, "Good luck, good listening ... and goodbye" were spoken by 83-year-old Stephen Williams, who had been the first person ever to say on the air "This is Radio Luxembourg" over 58 years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;"Last hours on 208m", aircheck available at playlist No 40 on ''The Station of the Stars: Audio Archive''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams was awarded the Order of Merit by the Grand Duke of Luxembourg in 1992.

He collected a large archive of material related to Radio Luxembourg, much of which his widow has donated to the Centre for Luxembourg Studies at Sheffield University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html Department of Germanic Studies, University of Sheffield] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062114/http://www.shef.ac.uk/german/prospectiveu_g/courses/clux.html |date=2007-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Genomics GTL Program Payoffs.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ecological analysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in an [[ecosystem]]]]
'''Systems ecology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[ecology]], a subset of [[Earth system science]], that takes a [[holism|holistic]] approach to the study of ecological systems, especially [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Shugart, Herman H., and Robert V. O'Neill. "Systems ecology". Dowden, Hutchingon &amp; Ross, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Dyne, George M. "Ecosystems, Systems Ecology, and Systems Ecologists". ORNL- 3975.

Central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a [[complex system]] exhibiting [[emergent properties]].  Systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems, and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions.  It uses and extends concepts from [[thermodynamics]] and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems.

==Overview==
Systems ecology seeks a [[Holism|holistic]] view of the interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems. Systems ecologists realise that the function of any ecosystem can be influenced by human economics in fundamental ways.  They have therefore taken an additional transdisciplinary step by including economics in the consideration of [[ecological economics|ecological-economic]] systems. In the words of [[R.L. Kitching]]:&lt;ref&gt;R.L. Kitching 1983, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Systems ecology can be defined as the approach to the study of ecology of organisms using the techniques and philosophy of systems analysis: that is, the methods and tools developed, largely in engineering, for studying, characteriszing and making predictions about complex entities, that is, systems..
* ''In any study of an ecological system, an essential early procedure is to draw a diagram of the system of interest ... diagrams indicate the system's '''boundaries''' by a solid line. Within these boundaries, series of components are isolated which have been chosen to represent that portion of the world in which the systems analyst is interested ... If there are no connections across the systems' boundaries with the surrounding '''systems environments''', the systems are described as ''closed''. Ecological work, however, deals almost exclusively with ''open'' systems.''&lt;ref&gt;(Kitching 1983, p.11)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mode of scientific enquiry, a central feature of Systems Ecology is the general application of the [[principles of energetics]] to all systems at any scale. Perhaps the most notable proponent of this view was [[Howard T. Odum]] - sometimes considered the father of ecosystems ecology. In this approach the principles of energetics constitute [[ecosystem principles]]. Reasoning by [[formal analogy]] from one system to another enables the Systems Ecologist to see principles functioning in an analogous manner across system-scale boundaries. H.T. Odum commonly used the [[Energy Systems Language]] as a tool for making systems diagrams and flow charts.

The fourth of these principles, the [[Maximum power principle|principle of maximum power efficiency]], takes central place in the analysis and synthesis of ecological systems. The fourth principle suggests that the most evolutionarily advantageous system function occurs when the environmental load matches the internal resistance of the system. The further the environmental load is from matching the internal resistance, the further the system is away from its sustainable steady state. Therefore, the systems ecologist engages in a task of resistance and impedance matching in [[ecological engineering]], just as the [[electronic engineer]] would do.

===Deep ecology===
{{Main article|Deep ecology}}

Deep ecology is an ideology whose metaphysical underpinnings are deeply concerned with the science of ecology. The term was coined by [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]], a Norwegian philosopher, [[Gandhi]]an scholar, and [[environmental activist]]. He argues that the prevailing approach to [[environmental management]] is [[anthropocentric]], and that the natural environment is not only "more complex than we imagine, it is more complex than we can imagine."&lt;ref&gt;A statement attributed to British biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]]&lt;/ref&gt; Naess formulated deep ecology in 1973 at an environmental conference in Budapest.

[[Joanna Macy]], [[John Seed]], and others developed Naess' thesis into a branch they called ''experiential deep ecology''. Their efforts were motivated by a need they perceived for the development of an "[[ecological self]]", which views the human ego as an integrated part of a living system that encompasses the individual. They sought to transcend [[altruism]] with a deeper self-interest based on [[biospherical equality]] beyond human chauvinism.

===Earth systems engineering and management===
{{Main article|Earth systems engineering and management}}
Earth systems engineering and management (ESEM) is a discipline used to analyze, design, engineer and manage [[Complexity|complex]] [[Natural environment|environmental]] [[system]]s.  It entails a wide range of subject areas including anthropology, engineering, [[environmental science]], ethics and philosophy. At its core, ESEM looks to "rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion"

===Ecological economics===
{{Main article|Ecological economics}}
Ecological economics is a transdisciplinary field of academic research that addresses the dynamic and spatial interdependence between human economies and natural [[ecosystem]]s. Ecological economics brings together and connects different disciplines, within the natural and social sciences but especially between these broad areas. As the name suggests, the field is made up of researchers with a background in [[economics]] and [[ecology]]. An important motivation for the emergence of ecological economics has been criticism on the assumptions and approaches of traditional (mainstream) [[Environmental economics|environmental and resource economics]].

===Ecological energetics===
{{Main article|Ecological energetics}}
Ecological energetics is the quantitative study of the flow of energy through ecological systems. It aims to uncover the [[Scientific law|principles]] which describe the propensity of such energy flows through the trophic, or 'energy availing' levels of ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows or "ecosystem laws" (i.e. principles of ecological energetics) are considered formally analogous to the [[principles of energetics]].

===Ecological humanities===
{{Main article|Ecological humanities}}
Ecological humanities aims to bridge the divides between the sciences and the humanities, and between [[Western culture|Western]], [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] ways of knowing nature. Like ecocentric political theory, the ecological humanities are characterised by a connectivity ontology and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to [[Ecology|ecological]] laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system.

===Ecosystem ecology===

[[File:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA)]]
{{Main article|Ecosystem ecology}}
Ecosystem ecology is the integrated study of [[Life|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s. Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structure and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact.

The relationship between systems ecology and ecosystem ecology is complex.  Much of systems ecology can be considered a subset of ecosystem ecology.  Ecosystem ecology also utilizes methods that have little to do with the holistic approach of systems ecology.  However, systems ecology more actively considers external influences such as economics that usually fall outside the bounds of ecosystem ecology.  Whereas ecosystem ecology can be defined as the scientific study of ecosystems, systems ecology is more of a particular approach to the study of ecological systems and phenomena that interact with these systems.

===Industrial ecology===
{{Main article|Industrial ecology}}
Industrial ecology is the study of [[industrial process]]es as linear (open loop) systems, in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste, to a closed loop system where wastes become inputs for new processes.

The '''Trobriand Islands''' are a {{convert|450|km2|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[archipelago]] of coral atolls off the east coast of [[New Guinea]]. They are part of the nation of [[Papua New Guinea]] and are in [[Milne Bay Province]]. Most of the population of 12,000 indigenous inhabitants live on the main island of [[Kiriwina]], which is also the location of the government station, [[Losuia]]. Other major islands in the group are [[Kaileuna]], [[Vakuta]], and [[Kitava]]. The group is considered to be an important [[Trobriand Islands rain forests|tropical rainforest]] ecoregion in need of conservation.

==Geography==
The Trobriands consist of four main islands, the largest being Kiriwina Island, and the others being Kaileuna, Vakuta and Kitava. Kiriwina is {{convert|43|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} long, and varies in width from {{convert|1|to|16|km}}. In the 1980s, there were around sixty villages on the island, containing around 12,000 people, while the other islands were restricted to a population of hundreds. Other than some elevation on Kiriwina, the islands are flat coral atolls and "remain hot and humid throughout the year, with frequent rainfall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=Orlando, Florida |first=Annette B. |last=Weiner |year=1988 |pages=10–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People==
The people of the area are mostly [[subsistence farming|subsistence]] [[Horticulture|horticulturalists]] who live in traditional settlements. The social structure is based on [[matrilineal]] clans that control land and resources. People participate in the regional circuit of exchange of shells called ''[[kula ring|kula]]'', sailing to visit trade partners on seagoing canoes. In the late twentieth century, anti-colonial and cultural autonomy movements gained followers from the Trobriand societies. When inter-group warfare was forbidden by colonial rulers, the islanders developed a unique, aggressive form of [[Trobriand cricket|cricket]].

Although an understanding of reproduction and modern medicine is widespread in Trobriand society, their traditional beliefs have been remarkably resilient. For example, the real cause of pregnancy is believed to be a [[baloma]], or ancestral spirit, that enters the body of a woman, and without whose existence a woman could not become pregnant; all babies are made or come into existence (ibubulisi) in Tuma. These tenets form the main stratum of what can be termed popular or universal belief. In the past, many held this traditional belief because the [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], a major food of the island, included chemicals ([[phytoestrogen]]s and plant [[sterol]]s) whose effects are contraceptive, so the practical link between sex and pregnancy was not very evident.&lt;ref name=Weiner&gt;Weiner, Annette B. The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea. United States of America: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
The Trobriand peoples speak [[Kilivila–Louisiades languages|Kilivila]], though various different dialects of it are spoken amongst each different tribe. It is an [[Austronesian language]], although has the distinction of having a complex system for classifying [[noun]]s. Foreign languages are less commonly spoken, although by the 1980s at least, Trobrianders occasionally spoke [[Tok Pisin]] and [[English language|English]]. The term "Trobriand" itself is not Kilivilan: the islands take this name from the French explorer [[Jean François Sylvestre Denis de Trobriand]] who visited in 1793.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1988 11"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea |publisher= Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location= Orlando, Florida |first= Annette B. |last= Weiner |year= 1988 |page= 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Wmalinowski trobriand isles 1918.jpg|thumb|300px|Malinowski in the Trobriands]]
Drawing upon earlier work by [[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Dorothy D. Lee]]'s scholarly writings refer to "non-lineal codifications of reality". In such a linguistic system, the concept of linear progress of time, geometric shapes, and even conventional methods of description, are lost altogether or altered. In her example of a specific indigenous yam, Lee explains that when the yam moves from a state of sprouting through ripeness to over-ripeness, the name for each object in a specific state changes entirely - the description of the object at different states of development relates to wholly different perceptions of the object. Ripeness is considered a "defining ingredient" and thus once it becomes over-ripe, a yam is perceived as a new object altogether. The same perception pertains to time and geometric shapes.&lt;ref name="Lee 1950"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food===
In Trobriand society, it is taboo to eat in front of others. As Jennifer Shute noted, "the Trobrianders eat alone, retiring to their own hearths with their portions, turning their backs on one another and eating rapidly for fear of being observed."&lt;ref name="Weiner 1988 21–22"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=Orlando, Florida |first=Annette B. |last=Weiner |year=1988 |pages=21–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is perfectly acceptable to chew [[betel nuts]], particularly when mixed with some pepper plant and slaked lime to make the nut less bitter. The betel nut acts as a stimulant and is commonly used by Trobrianders, causing their teeth to often appear red.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1988 21–22"/&gt; Because in the past food was often scarce, to boast of having food is one of the Trobriand Islanders' chief glories and ambitions . Though food is most important, and the subject of food is most discussed, at Miamala, the annual time of harvest and feasting, the islanders can face hunger and scarcity due to poor growing conditions at any time of year. In mid-2009 the problem of population pressure, leading to food insecurity, received much national and international media attention.&lt;ref&gt;MacCarthy, M. (2012). Playing Politics with Yams: Food Security in the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea. Culture, Agriculture, Food &amp; Environment, 34(2), 136-147. doi:10.1111/j.2153-9561.2012.01073.x
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage customs===
At seven or eight years of age, Trobriand children begin to play erotic games with each other and imitate adult seductive attitudes. About four or five years later, they begin to pursue sexual partners. They change partners often. Women are just as assertive and dominant as men in pursuing or refusing a lover.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt; This is not only allowed, but encouraged.

In the Trobriand Islands, there is no traditional marriage ceremony. A young woman stays in her lover's house instead of leaving it before sunrise. The man and woman sit together in the morning and wait for the bride's mother to bring them cooked yams.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt; The married couple eat together for about a year, and then go back to eating separately. Once the man and woman eat together, the marriage is officially recognized.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt;

When a Trobriand couple want to marry each other, they show their interest by sleeping together, spending time together, and staying with each other for several weeks. The girl's parents approve of the couple when a girl accepts a gift from a boy. After that, the girl moves to the boy's house, eats her meals there, and accompanies her husband all day. Then word goes out that the boy and girl are married.&lt;ref name=Ember&gt;Ember, Carol R., and Melvin Ember. Cultural Anthropology. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

If after one year, a woman is unhappy with her husband, she may divorce him. A married couple may also get divorced if the husband chooses another woman. The man may try to go back with the woman he left by giving her family yams and other gifts, but it is ultimately up to the woman if she wants to be with that man.

===Magic===
Trobriands believe that conception is the result of an ancestral spirit entering the woman's body. Even after a child is born, it is the mother's brother, not the father, who presents a harvest of yams to his sister so that her child will be fed with food from its own matrilineage, not the father's.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt;

The Trobrianders practice many traditional magic spells. Young people learn spells from older kin in exchange for food, tobacco, and money. Spells are often partially or fully lost because the old people give away only a few lines at a time to keep getting gifts. Often, the old person dies before they finish passing on the spells. Trobrianders believe that no one can make up a new magic spell.

Sometimes a man gives a woman magic spells because he wants to give her more than betel nuts or tobacco. People also buy and sell spells. Literate villagers write their magic spells in books and hide them. A person may direct magic spells toward heightening the visual and olfactory effects of their body to induce erotic feelings in their lover. Some spells are thought to make a person beautiful, even those who would normally be considered ugly.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt; The beauty magic words are chanted into coconut oil, and then a person rubs it onto their skin, or into flowers and herbs that decorate their armbands and hair.

=== Cricket ===
After tribal conflict was banned, cricket became a replacement for war in the Trobriand culture. The colonial powers were appalled with the violence and sexual displays associated with tribal warfare.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/716069710|title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology|last=Holly.|first=Peters-Golden,|date=2012|publisher=The McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=9780078117022|edition= 6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa|pages=258|oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are often played between all male teams and last for several months.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are often feasts for the winning team.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While regular cricket is played around the world, these islanders add their own elements which reflect their culture. Since this sport resembles war, there is not a limit on team size. For example, every time a team scores there is a special dance ritual involved. These dances are an adaptation of the former war rituals. Therefore, they consist of taunts and jeers often criticizing the other team.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Concord Media|title=Trobriand Cricket|date=2013-07-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnrpGMK31Hk|accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The words are sexual metaphors, used as one team taunts the other and exhibits their physical and sexual prowess to the appraising eyes of the young women on the sidelines"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often, there is also magic involved in this sporting event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teams will use charms and incantations to gain an advantage in the match. For example, a spell could be used to make the team less efficient in scoring.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The visiting team is expected to lose when visiting a rival island.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, when this is not the case, there are often reports of vandalism and arson when matches end unfavorably for the home team.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During such events, yam houses are burned which is considered a major insult.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In essence, this form of cricket has a more aggressive feel and is an important part of Trobriand life.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Currency===
Trobrianders use [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s as currency, and consider them a sign of wealth and power. 
Western visitors will often buy items from the Trobrianders using money. There is also a [[Kula ring|Kula]] exchange, which is a very important tradition among the Trobriand Islands. The women also use bundles of scored banana leaves.

====Yam exchanges====
Each year, a man grows yams for his sister, and his daughter if she is married. The husband does not provide yams to his wife. The more yams a woman receives, the more powerful and rich she is. The husband is expected to give his wife's father or brother a gift in turn for the yams they give his wife. When the woman is first married, she receives yams from her father until the woman's brother thinks his sister and her husband are old enough for him to give the yams.
[[File:Trobriand yam house.jpg|thumb|250px|Wood carving of a traditional yam store in the Trobriand Islands]]
At the beginning of the yam harvest, the yams stay on display in gardens for about a month before the gardener takes them to the owner. The owner is always a woman. There is a great ceremony for this every year. The yams are loaded into the woman's husband's empty yam house. Young people come to the gardens dressed in their most festive traditional clothes early on the day the yams are delivered to the yam house. The young people are all related to the gardener, and carry the yam baskets to the owner's [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]. When they get to the owner's hamlet, they sing out to announce the arrival of the yams while [[hip thrusting|thrusting out their hips]] in a sexually provocative motion. This emphasizes the relation between yams and sexuality. A few days later, the gardener comes and loads the yam house, and the man is now responsible for the yam.

The yam house owner provides the gardener and young people with cooked yams, [[taro]], and pork. Sometimes, no pig is killed, perhaps because the yam house owner did not have a pig to spare. The yam house owner also may decide not kill a pig for the gardener because he is unsatisfied with the number of yams, or is angry with the gardener for another reason. Once the yam houses are full, a man performs a special magic spell for the hamlet that wards off hunger by making people feel full. The women also use bundles of scored banana leaves as a type of currency between themselves. As many days of work are required to make bundles each one has an assigned value and can be used to buy canned foods as well as given away in exchange for other goods.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt;

===Death===
When a person dies, mourning continues for months. The spouse is joined in mourning by female kin and the dead person's father's sisters. These villagers stay in the house and cry four times a day. If someone who did not attend the funeral comes to the village, he or she must immediately join in on the mourning that is taking place. Other workers observe many of the mourning taboos. Most of them shave their heads. People closely related to the deceased avoid eating "good food." Those more distantly related may wear black clothes. Before this, however, everyone receives a payment from the owners for the part they had in the burial process.

The first set of exchanges takes place the day after burial and involves yams, taro, and small amounts of money. The spouse, the spouse's matrilineage, and the dead person's father or father's representative, and members of his matrilineage get the largest distribution.&lt;ref name=Weiner/&gt;

===Missionisation===
'Missionisation' has had a mixed effect on daily Triobriand life.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Toby Marshall|title=The Unholy Paradise.mp4|date=2012-05-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWE-kpOoBv8|accessdate=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the islanders adhere to native tribal traditions. In an attempt to counter this, missionaries experienced with animist tribes are sometimes sent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One example is trying to insert Christian blessings in traditional funeral ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
[[File:Soul boat, Trobriand Islands, Paupa New Guinea, Bishop Museum, 1989.400.268.JPG|250px|thumb|Soul boat, [[Kiriwina]], Trobriand Islands (wood and white lime)]]
The first European visitor to the islands was the French ship ''Espérance'' in 1793. The ship's navigator, [[Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]], named them after his first lieutenant, Denis de Trobriand. The first European to settle in the Trobriand islands was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] minister who moved to the island of Kiriwina in 1894. He was followed a decade later by colonial officers from Australia who set up a governmental station nearby, and soon a small colony began to be set up by foreign traders on the island. Then in the 1930s, the Sacred Heart Catholic Mission set up a settlement containing a primary school nearby. It was following this European colonisation that the name "Trobriand" was legally adopted for this group of islands.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1988 11"/&gt;

The first [[anthropology|anthropologist]] to study the Trobrianders was C. G. Seligman, who focused on the Massim people of mainland New Guinea. Seligman was followed a number of years later by his student, the Polish [[Bronisław Malinowski]], who visited the islands during the [[First World War]]. Despite being a citizen of the [[Austro-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]], which was at war with [[Australia]] which then controlled the Trobriand Islands, he was allowed to stay (provided he checked in with authorities every now and then).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=Orlando, Florida |first=Annette B. |last=Weiner |year=1988 |pages=1–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His descriptions of the ''[[Kula ring|kula]]'' exchange system, gardening, magic, and sexual practices—all classics of modern anthropological writing—prompted many foreign researchers to visit the societies of the island group and study other aspects of their cultures. The psychoanalyst [[Wilhelm Reich]] drew on Malinowski's studies of the islands in writing his ''[[The Invasion of Compulsory Sex Morality]]'' and consequently in developing his theory of sex economy in his 1936 work ''[[Die Sexualität im Kulturkampf]]''.

In 1943, Allied troops landed on the islands as a part of [[Operation Cartwheel]], the Allied advance to [[Rabaul]]. In the 1970s, some indigenous peoples formed anti-colonial associations and political movements.

==Trobriand Islands in the modern day ==

=== Growing population ===
Since 1975, the government of [[Papua New Guinea]] has had political control of the island. In this time of growth, the population of the island is expanding quickly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, more land is needed to be cleared to accommodate the increasing population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In other words, there are environmental concerns like [[deforestation]] which affect the islands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To counteract this, the government often sends [[social work]]ers to increase the use of [[birth control]] and contraception.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the Trobriand culture is not accepting the outside influences dictating their reproductive norms. This means that sex is "the most natural thing in the culture".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another effect of Trobriand promiscuity is the rapid spread of [[HIV/AIDS]] on the island.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/716069710|title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology|last=Holly.|first=Peters-Golden,|date=2012|publisher=The McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=9780078117022|edition= 6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa|pages=264|oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented case of HIV/AIDS was reported in 2001. Nowadays, HIV has become a major health problem. Since young Trobrianders often have multiple sexual partners before marriage, it is hard to slow the spread of the disease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; “The moralistic tropes of risk and promiscuity that dominate the language of HIV prevention are not easily accommodated by Trobriand ideations of sexuality, which celebrate premarital sexual activity as healthy and life-affirming, and which stress the productive values of reciprocity and relations of difference.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Income inequality ===
After statehood in 1975, the Trobriand Islands’ economy has been restructured to fit a tourist and export market. Most Trobrianders live on less than one dollar a day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since food has been traditionally distributed among the people based on their need, there has been little need for a currency based economy outside of the Kula rings.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/716069710|title=Culture sketches : case studies in anthropology|last=Holly.|first=Peters-Golden,|date=2012|publisher=The McGraw-Hill|year=|isbn=9780078117022|edition= 6th |location=Dubuque, Iowa|pages=168|oclc=716069710}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counteract this lack of hard currency, several western goods stores have opened on the islands and created most of the foreign goods market. These stores are multimillion dollar enterprises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, most Trobrianders struggle to pay for goods from these stores because they only take cash.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to this practice, there are often reports of unrest because of a lack of funds. One remedy that many islanders seek is to sell cultural artifacts and relics to tourists in exchange for their currency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, a worker can spend 10 days working on a ceremonial [[turtle bowl]] and only get paid $10. "However this [[commercialization]] is often done sanctimoniously. "&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; “They protect their cultural identity and use it as a tourist commodity”. However, one of the items imported that causes economic and social problems is [[Areca nut|betel nuts]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are a major narcotic on the island.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to this new currency based economy there is more reported crime on the islands. There is a great economic disparity due to the income inequality between the modern world and the Trobriands.

===Education ===
In addition to missionary schools, there are public schools on the Trobriands which were introduced by the government of Papua New Guinea "All children are required to go to school".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The required subjects are English, Math, Science and culture. Schools also educate students about current international events .&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Math is the favorite subject among the students of the island.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On Wednesdays, the children are required to dress in traditional garb as part of the government mandated culture day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this time, children are encouraged to explore Trobriand culture, history and values.

=== Malinowski's plaque in Kiriwina ===
[[File:Malinowskis plaque.jpg|thumb|A plaque dedicated to Bronisław Malinowski in Omarakana, decorated by village children]]
There is a commemorative plaque dedicated to [[Bronisław Malinowski]] in Omarakana village, the residence village of the [[Paramount Chief]] of Trobriand Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Gumowska, Aleksandra, (2014). Seks, betel i czary. Życie seksualne dzikich sto lat później. Krakow: Znak Litera Nova. p. 29. {{ISBN|9788324025701}} 8324025707.&lt;/ref&gt; The current chief Pulayasi Daniel is positive that it is placed in the very same place where Malinowski's tent used to stand at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Gumowska, Aleksandra, (2014). Seks, betel i czary. Życie seksualne dzikich sto lat później. Krakow: Znak Litera Nova. p. 35. {{ISBN|9788324025701}} 8324025707.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two inscriptions on it – one in Polish and one in English – which say: "Toboma Miskabati Bronislaw Malinowski (1884-1942) Notable scientist The son of the Polish nation Father of the modern social anthropology Friend of Trobriand Islands peoples and the populizer of their culture" (see: picture). The plaque was brought to Kiriwina by sailors [[Monika Bronicka]] and Mariusz Delgas&lt;ref&gt;https://plus.dziennikbaltycki.pl/magazyn/a/przygoda-rafa-koralowa-i-zycie-bez-butow-zdjecia,12397095&lt;/ref&gt; who took it from [[New Zealand]] where it was left by two other yachts: "Maria" and "Victoria".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The plaque was founded by [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Cracow]] and National Museum in [[Stettin]], [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
