[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation Introduction Picture.jpg|thumb|alt=text]]
3D [[cell culture]] by the [[magnetic levitation]] method (MLM) is the application of growing 3D tissue by inducing cells treated with magnetic [[nanoparticle]] assemblies in spatially varying magnetic fields using [[neodymium]] magnetic drivers and promoting cell to cell interactions by levitating the cells up to the air/liquid interface of a standard [[petri dish]]. The magnetic nanoparticle assemblies consist of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, and the polymer [[polylysine]]. [[3D cell culture|3D cell culturing]] is scalable, with the capability for culturing 500 cells to millions of cells or from single dish to high-throughput low volume systems.&lt;ref name="One"&gt;Souza, G.

==Overview==
Standard [[monolayer]] cell culturing on tissue culture plastic has notably improved our understanding of basic cell biology, but it does not replicate the complex 3D architecture of [[in vivo]] tissue, and it can significantly modify cell properties. This often compromises experiments in basic life science, leads to misleading drug-screening results on [[efficacy]] and [[toxicity]], and produces cells that may lack the characteristics needed for developing tissue regeneration therapies.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Four"&gt;Pampaloni, F., Reynaud, E.

Cell Biol.7, 211-224 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The future of cell culturing for fundamental studies and biomedical applications lies in the creation of [[multicellular]] structure and organization in three-dimensions.&lt;ref name="Four" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Five" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eight" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten"&gt;Birgersdotter, A., Sandberg, R. &amp; Ernberg, I.

Regen. Med.1, 83-96 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Many schemes for 3D culturing are being developed or marketed, such as bio-reactors&lt;ref name="Thirteen"&gt;Bilodeau, K. &amp; Mantovani, D. Bioreactors for Tissue Engineering: Focus on Mechanical
Constraints. A Comparative Review. Tissue Eng.12, 2367-2383 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; or protein-based gel environments.&lt;ref name="Seven" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fourteen"&gt;Prestwich, G.

Enzyme Regul. 47, 196-207 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

A 3D cell culturing system known as the Bio-Assembler™ uses [[biocompatible]] polymer-based&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; [[reagents]] to deliver magnetic nanoparticles to individual cells so that an applied magnetic driver can levitate cells off the bottom of the cell culture dish and rapidly bring cells together near the air-liquid interface. This initiates [[cell-cell interactions]] in the absence of any artificial surface or [[matrix(biology)|matrix]]. Magnetic fields are designed to rapidly form 3D multicellular structures in as little as a few hours, including expression of [[extracellular matrix]] proteins. The [[morphology(biology)|morphology]], [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|protein expression]], and response to [[exogenous]] agents of resulting tissue show great similarity to in vivo results.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

==History==
3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation method (MLM)  was developed from collaboration between scientists at [[Rice University]] and [[University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; Since then, this technology has been licensed and commercialized by Nano3D Biosciences.&lt;ref name="Fifteen"&gt;"N3D Biosciences, Inc. » ABOUT US." N3D Biosciences, Inc. » ABOUT US. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Aug. 2012. &lt;http://www.n3dbio.com/about/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The magnetic levitation process==
[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation, The Magnetic Levitation Process.png|thumb|center|alt=text]]
Above is a picture showing 3D cell culturing through magnetic levitation with the Bio-Assembler cell culturing system. (A) A magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle assembly known as Nanoshuttle is added and dispersed over cells and the mixture is incubated. (B) After incubation with Nanoshuttle, cells are detached and transferred to a petri dish. (C) A magnetic drive is then placed on top of a petri dish top. (D) The magnetic field causes cells to rise to the air–medium interface. (E) Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) levitated for 60 minutes (left images) and 4 hours (right images) (Scale bar, 50 μm). The onset of cell-cell interaction takes place as soon as cells levitate, and 3D structures start to form. At 1 hour, the cells are still relatively dispersed, but they are already showing some signs of stretching. Formation of 3D structures is visible after 4 hours of levitation (arrows).&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;

==Protein expression==
Protein expression in levitated cultures shows striking similarity to in vivo patterns. N-cadherin expression in levitated human glioblastoma cells was identical to the expression seen in human tumor xenografts grown in immunodeficient mice, while standard 2D culture showed much weaker expression that did not match xenograft distribution as shown in the picture below.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; The transmembrane protein N-cadherin is often used as an indicator of in-vivo-like tissue assembly in 3D culturing.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;
[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation Protein Expression.jpg|thumb|center|alt=text]]
In the picture above, distribution of N-cadherin (red) and nuclei (blue) in human brain cancer mouse xenograft (left, human brain cancer cells grown in a mouse brain), brain cancer cells cultured by 3D magnetic levitation for 48 h. (middle), and cells cultured on a glass slide cover slip (2D, right). The 2D system shows N-cadherin in the cytoplasm and nucleus and notably absent from the membrane, while in the levitated culture and mouse, N-cadherin is clearly concentrated in the membrane, and also present in cytoplasm and cell junctions.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Co-culturing, magnetic manipulation, and invasion assays===
One of the challenges in generating in vivo like cultures or tissue in vitro is the difficulty in co-culturing different cell types. Because of the ability of 3D cell culturing by magnetic levitation to bring cells together, co-culturing different cell types is possible. Co-culturing of different cell types can be achieved at the onset of levitation, by mixing different cell types in before levitation or by magnetically guiding 3D cultures in an invasion assay format.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;

The unique ability to manipulate cells and shape tissue magnetically offers new possibilities for controlled co-culturing and invasion assays. Co-culturing in a realistic tissue architecture is critical for accurately modeling in vivo conditions, such as for increasing the accuracy of cellular assays as shown in the figure below.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;
[[File:3D Cell Culturing by Magnetic Levitation Invasion Assay.jpg|thumb|center|alt=text]]
Shown in the picture above is an invasion assay of magnetically levitated multicellular spheroids.&lt;ref name="One" /&gt; Fluorescence images of human glioblastoma (GBM) cells (green; GFP-expressing cells) and normal human astrocytes (NHA) (red; mCherry-labelled) cultured separately and then magnetically guided together (left, time 0). Invasion of GBM into NHAin 3D culture provides a powerful new assay for basic cancer biology and drug screening (right, 12h to 252h).&lt;ref name="One" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Two" /&gt;

===Vascular simulation with stem cells===
By facilitating assembly of different populations of cells using the MLM, consistent generation of organoids termed adipospheres capable of simulating the complex intercellular interactions of endogenous white adipose tissue (WAT) can be achieved.&lt;ref name="Sixteen"&gt;Daquinag, A. C., Souza, G. R., Kolonin, M. G. Adipose Tissue Engineering in Three-Dimensional Levitation Tissue Culture System Based on Magnetic Nanoparticles. Tissue Eng. Part C. -Not available-, ahead of print. doi:10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0198 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-culturing 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes in 3D with murine endothelial bEND.3 cells creates a vascular-like network assembly with concomitant lipogenesis in perivascular cells. See figure below.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

In addition to cell lines, WAT organogenesis can be simulated from primary cells.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

Adipocyte-depleted stromal vascular fraction (SVF) containing adipose stromal cells (ASC), endothelial cells, and infiltrating leukocyte derived from mouse white adipose tissue (WAT) were cultured in 3D. This revealed organoids striking in hierarchical organization with distinct capsule and internal large vessel-like structures lined with endothelial cells, as well as perivascular localization of ASC.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

Upon adipogenesis induction of either 3T3-L1 adipospheres or adipospheres derived from SVF, the cells efficiently formed large lipid droplets typical of white adipocytes in vivo, whereas only smaller lipid droplet formation is achievable in 2D. This indicates intercellular signaling that better recapitulates WAT organogenesis.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

This MLM for 3D co-culturing creates adipospheres appropriate for WAT modeling ex vivo and provides a new platform for functional screens to identify molecules bioactive toward individual adipose cell populations. It can also be adopted for WAT transplantation applications and aid other approaches to WAT-based cell therapy.&lt;ref name="Sixteen" /&gt;

===Organized co-culturing to create in vivo-like tissue===
Using the MagPen™ (a Nano3D Biosciences, Inc. product), organized 3D co-cultures similar to native tissue architecture can be rapidly created. Endothelial cells (PEC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), fibroblasts (PF), and epithelial cells (EpiC) cultured with the Bio-Assembler™ can be sequentially layered in a drag-and-drop manner to create bronchioles that maintain phenotype and induce extracellular matrix formation.&lt;ref name="Seventeen"&gt;Tseng, H., Gage, J. A., Raphael, R., Moore, R. H., Killian, T. C., [[Jane Grande-Allen|Grande-Allen, K. J.]], Souza, G. R. Assembly of a three-dimensional multitype bronchiole co-culture model using magnetic levitation. Tissue Eng. Part C. -Not available-, ahead of print. doi:10.1089/ten.TEC.2012.0157 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''acquiring bank''' (also known simply as an '''acquirer''') is a [[bank]] or financial institution that processes [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]] payments on behalf of a merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://chargebacks911.com/knowledge-base/difference-between-acquiring-bank-and-issuing-bank/ |title=Difference Between ‘Acquiring Bank’ and ‘Issuing Bank’ |date=April 6, 2015 |publisher=chargebacks911}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acquirer allows merchants to accept credit card payments from the card-issuing banks within an association. The best-known (credit) [[card association]]s are [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[MasterCard]], [[Discover Card|Discover]], [[China UnionPay]], [[American Express]], [[Diners Club International|Diners Club]], [[Japan Credit Bureau]] and [[RuPay|Indian Rupay]].

The acquiring bank enters into a contract with a merchant and offers it a [[merchant account]]. This arrangement provides the merchant with a [[line of credit]].  Under the agreement, the acquiring bank exchanges funds with [[issuing bank]]s on behalf of the merchant, and pays the merchant for its daily payment-card activity's net balance—that is, gross sales minus reversals, [[interchange fee]]s, and acquirer fees. Acquirer fees are an additional markup added to association interchange fees by the acquiring bank, and those fees vary at the acquirer's discretion.

==Risk==
The acquiring bank accepts the risk that the merchant will remain [[solvency|solvent]]. The main source of risk to the acquiring bank is fund reversals.  Consumers can trigger the reversal of funds in three ways:

* A card refund is the return of funds to the consumer, voluntarily initiated by the merchant.
* A card reversal is where the merchant cancels a transaction after it has been authorized but before settlement occurs.
* A card [[chargeback]] occurs in a dispute between the merchant and the cardholder over the validity of the transaction. The cardholder may request the return of funds through the issuing bank for various reasons, including that the goods were not received or were faulty, or that the cardholder lacks knowledge of the transaction.

Card associations consider a participating merchant to be a risk if more than 1% of payments received result in a chargeback.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] levy fines against acquiring banks that retain merchants with a high chargeback frequency. To defray the cost of any fines received, the acquiring banks are inclined (but not required) to pass such fines on to the merchant. These fees are generally charged to the merchant.

Due to the high amount of risk acquiring banks are anticipated to face, as well as their key position in the payment chain, the security of electronic payments is a great concern for these institutions. For this reason, they have been involved in the development of electronic point-of-sale security standards such as [[Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|PCI-DSS]].

After the invention of the mechanical [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in Germany (circa 1439), Armenians from throughout [[Armenian diaspora|the diaspora]] began to publish Armenian-language books. The first book which had Armenian letters was published in [[Mainz]] ([[Germany]]) in 1486. The first Armenian book to be published by the printing press was ''Urbatagirq''—Book of Friday prayers—which was published by [[Hakob Meghapart]] in [[Venice]] in 1512.

In the 16th century there were published 31 books, in 17th  century – 164 and in 18th there were 824 [[Armenian language|Armenian]] books printed.

* The first Armenian book was published by Hakob Meghapart in 1512 in [[Venice]] ([[Italy]]). The book was called «Ուրբաթագիրք» ("[[Urpatakirk]]", "Friday Book").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.am/meghapart/English/1500.htm Hakob Meghapart project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715223726/http://www.nla.am/meghapart/English/1500.htm |date=July 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;
* Abgar Dpir Tokhatetsi published an Armenian book in [[Constantinople]] ([[Ottoman Empire]]) in 1568.

* The first Armenian printing house in [[Persia]] was established in [[New Julfa]] ([[Isfahan]], [[Iran]]) in 1636. The first book to be published in this printing house was «Սաղմոսարան» ("Saghmosaran", "Psalter"); it was published in 1638 by [[Khachatur Kesaratsi]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.am/meghapart/English/1600.htm Hakob Meghapart project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531152852/http://www.nla.am/meghapart/English/1600.htm |date=May 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the first Persian book in [[Persia]] was published 192 years later in 1830.
* The first Armenian printing house in [[Armenia]] was established in [[Ejmiatsin|Vagharshapat]] in 1771 and the first book was called «Զբօսարան Հոգեւոր» ("Zbosaran Hogevor", "Spiritual walking"); it was published in 1772 by [[Simeon I of Yerevan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ermeni.org/ermenice/vagharshapat_uni.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226022545/http://ermeni.org/ermenice/vagharshapat_uni.htm |archivedate=2010-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first Armenian printing house in [[Russia]] was set up in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1781. Grigor Khaldariants' had type sent from [[London]], and under the sponsorship of the Primate of Armenians in Russia, Bishop Hovsep' Arghutian, he edited the first Armenian book to be published in the Tsarist realm, «Տետրակ այբբենական» ("Tetrak aybbenakan", "ABC Reader") in 1781. He then printed works such as «Բանալի գիտութեան» ("Banali Gitut'ean", "The Key to Science"), «Շաւիղ լեզվագիտութեան» ("Shavigh Lezvagitut'ean", "Linguistic Guide"), and «Ընդհանրական»("Endhanrakan", "Encyclical Letter") by Nersés Shnorhali.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyeetch.nareg.com.au/culture/book_p1.html HyeEtch - Arts &amp; Culture: The Art of The Book, page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century ===
After the [[sovietization]] of Armenia, [[Yerevan]] becoming the center of the Armenian printing, where in 1921 organized by the State Publishing House. It assumes the functions of editing and organization publications. Makes its political, artistic, scientific, publications for children with relatively large circulations. Separated from the State Publishing House publishing house “Luys” (Light), specialized mainly in the publication of textbooks. In 1964 from publishing Armenian State Publishing House (HayPetHrap) was renamed “Hayastan” (Armenia).  In 1976 have been separated from the last publishing “Sovetakan Grogh” (Soviet writer), which it published in the most artistic and literary works. [[Armenian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Science of Armenian SSR]] published a monograph of scientific and other research literature, and publish works of Armenian classical and scientific texts from the [[Matenadaran]] as well. Publishing house of  [[Yerevan State University]] publishes textbooks, collections and scientific monographs since 1922. From this period also involved in publishing the [[National Library of Armenia|National Library]], “Gitelik” (knowledge) and several others. In 1980 have acted in Yerevan on 20 printers. From 1922 until the end of 1970 in Armenia were published about 45 thousand titles of books. In the last years of Soviet power in Armenia each year were printed about 1,100 titles. During this period, books and periodicals published in the Armenian language as in other republics of the USSR.

Since 1920 (the sovietization of Armenia) to the 1980s main centers of the Armenian printing press in the [[Armenian Diaspora|diaspora]] were  [[Istanbul]], [[Cairo]] and [[Beirut]] (the latter now is its main center). At this moment the Armenian Diaspora was published about 21 thousand titles. Total number of items of Armenian newspapers in 1512 and 1980, more than 80 thousand.

[[File:Astrocompass.jpg|thumb|[[World War II]] Astrocompass dials and adjustments]]
An '''astrocompass''' is a navigational tool for determining the direction of true [[north]] through the positions of various [[astronomical]] bodies.

There are certain circumstances when magnetic [[compass]]es and [[gyrocompass]]es are unreliable. The most obvious is in [[polar regions]], where the force exerted on the needle of a magnetic compass is nearly vertical and gyrocompasses become unstable due to the rotation of the [[Earth]]. Magnetic compasses are also susceptible to disruption from magnetic fields other than the Earth's, such as those produced by the hulls of some metal vehicles or craft. Before the advent of electronic navigational aids such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] the most reliable way to ascertain north in such circumstances was through the use of an astrocompass.

==Principle of use==

The Earth's axis of rotation remains, for all intents and purposes, stationary throughout the year. Thus, with knowledge of the current [[time]] and geographical position in the form of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], which are set on the instrument using dials, an astrocompass can be sighted on to any astronomical object with a known position to give an extremely accurate reading.

In its most basic form, the astrocompass consists of a base plate marked with the points of the compass, with a mechanism known as an equatorial drum mounted on it. On this drum is a set of adjustable [[Sight (device)|sights]] and a scale of [[declination]]. More advanced versions may have built-in [[marine chronometer|chronometers]] or default settings for bodies such as the [[Sun]].

To use the compass, the base plate is first levelled with the horizon then pointed roughly to what the user believes to be north. The equatorial drum is then tilted in relation to this base according to the local latitude. The sights are then set using the local [[hour angle]] and the declination of whatever astronomical body is being used. Once all these settings have been made, the astrocompass is simply turned until the astronomical body is visible in the sights: it will then be precisely aligned to the points of the compass. Because of this procedure, an astrocompass requires its user to be in possession of a [[nautical almanac]] or similar astronomical tables, one of its chief disadvantages.

==Historical uses==
Astrocompasses only became useful following the invention of the [[marine chronometer]], without which it is almost useless for navigation. Even then, they saw only limited use, with first magnetic compasses and then gyrocompasses being preferred in almost all cases. Polar exploration was one of the fields in which the astrocompass saw the most use, for the reasons described above. They have also been used throughout history in other climes to check the accuracy of other forms of compasses. They saw use, for example, in the [[North African Campaign]] of [[World War II|World War 2]].

[[GPS]] and other similar forms of [[electronic navigation]] aids mean that the astrocompass is now functionally [[obsolete]] anywhere except for areas very close to the poles where GPS coverage is not available and there are no current electronic navigation aids.

==Operation==
The operation is as follows:
#Getting the local time (by means of a clock)
#Setting the latitude
#Setting (in the alidade) the star's [[local hour angle]] (LHA) for that day obtained by means of tables or a computer program
#Pointing the compass pinnula to the star ([[sun]] or [[moon]]) 
#Reading the true course on the limb

'''Avantix B8070''', more commonly known as Avantix MultiTicket was a passenger-operated railway ticket issuing system,  installed at British railway stations from 1999 onwards. The machines were available as upgrades to the [[Ascom B8050 Quickfare]] or as new build. 

The machine was developed by [[Sema Group]], later SchlumbergerSema and then [[Atos Origin]].

Most machines were withdrawn during 2007 and 2008. The last Avantix B8070 was withdrawn in January 2009. 

==Introduction of the Avantix B8070==

A pilot Avantix B8070 was trialled at East Croydon railway station during 1998. The first machines in live use went into service on [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] stations, starting with [[St Albans City railway station|St Albans]]. Other significant deployments followed on [[South West Trains]], at [[West Anglia Great Northern]] stations between [[Kings Lynn railway station|Kings Lynn]] and [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] and on [[c2c]]. Small numbers of machines were deployed at other stations including [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]], [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester Piccadilly]] and [[Paddington station|London Paddington]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stannsulyn.dsl.pipex.com/machines/avantix.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details of the machine==
The user interface comprised an ATM style display screen with hardware buttons for selecting menu items displayed on each side of the screen. 

B8070 machines were fitted with an industrial PC connected to the UK rail wide area network. This offered a significant advantage over the B8050 in support terms giving the ability to connect to each machine from a central location and :
* update fares 
* change the tickets on offer
* diagnose faults  

A significant advantage of the Avantix B8070 over the Ascom B8050 was the ability to handle credit-card payments. Initially this was by reading the magnetic stripe of the credit-card, but this was updated to handle [[Chip and PIN]] cards with the addition of a Hypercom Chip and Pin card reader and pin pad.

The software application could handle tickets to all GB destinations, however, to reduce scrolling through lists of stations, these were in practice limited to 200 most popular destinations from the station, plus all of the [[London Underground]] destinations.

===Ticket stock===

Avantix B8070 offered the standard centre stripe mag encoded orange CCST stock for singles and returns, and also the green season ticket stock. Receipts were printed on a white tally roll. 

===Branding===

Several train operating companies took the opportunity to customise the front of the machine with branded graphics.

'''Bloom's taxonomy''' is a set of three hierarchical models used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The three lists cover the learning objectives in cognitive, affective and sensory domains. The cognitive domain list has been the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum learning objectives, assessments and activities.

The models were named after [[Benjamin Bloom]], who chaired the committee of educators that devised the taxonomy. He also edited the first volume of the standard text, ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals''.&lt;ref name="bloom1956"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=B.

==History==
Although named after Bloom, the publication of ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives'' followed a series of conferences from 1949 to 1953, which were designed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations.{{sfn|Bloom et al.|1956|p=4|ps=: "The idea for this classification system was formed at an informal meeting of college examiners attending the 1948 American Psychological Association Convention in Boston. At this meeting, interest was expressed in a theoretical framework which could be used to facilitate communication among examiners.}}

The first volume of the taxonomy, ''Handbook I: Cognitive''&lt;ref name="bloom1956" /&gt; was published in 1956, and in 1964 the second volume ''Handbook II: Affective'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=Elizabeth J. |title=The classification of educational objectives: Psychomotor domain |year=1966 |journal=Illinois Journal of Home Economics |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=110–144 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Harrow |first=Anita J. |year=1972 |title=A taxonomy of the psychomotor domain: A guide for developing behavioral objectives |place=New York |publisher=David McKay Company |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Dave |first=R.

== The cognitive domain (knowledge-based)==
In the original version of the taxonomy, the cognitive domain is broken into the following six levels of objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hoy |first=Anita Woolfolk |date=2007 |title=Educational psychology |edition=10th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |pages=530–531, 545 |isbn=0205459463 |oclc=68694368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 revised edition of Bloom's taxonomy, the levels are slightly different: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create (rather than Synthesize).&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Patricia|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|url=https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/|website=Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge===
Knowledge involves recognizing or remembering facts, terms, basic concepts, or answers without necessarily understanding what they mean. Its characteristics may include:
*Knowledge of specifics—terminology, specific facts
*Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics—conventions, trends and sequences, classifications and categories, criteria, methodology
*Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field—principles and generalizations, theories and structures

''Example'': Name three common varieties of apple.

===Comprehension===
Comprehension involves demonstrating understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating the main ideas.

''Example'': Compare the identifying characteristics of a Golden Delicious apple with a Granny Smith apple.

===Application===
Application involves using acquired knowledge—solving problems in new situations by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules. Learners should be able to use prior knowledge to solve problems, identify connections and relationships and how they apply in new situations.

''Example'': Would apples prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C?

===Analysis===
Analysis involves examining and breaking information into component parts, determining how the parts relate to one another, identifying motives or causes, making inferences, and finding evidence to support generalizations. Its characteristics include:
*Analysis of elements
*Analysis of relationships
*Analysis of organization

''Example'': List four ways of serving foods made with apples and explain which ones have the highest health benefits. Provide references to support your statements.

===Synthesis===
Synthesis involves building a structure or pattern from diverse elements; it also refers to the act of putting parts together to form a whole. Its characteristics include:
*Production of a unique communication
*Production of a plan, or proposed set of operations
*Derivation of a set of abstract relations

''Example'': Convert an "unhealthy" recipe for apple pie to a "healthy" recipe by replacing your choice of ingredients. Explain the health benefits of using the ingredients you chose vs. the original ones.

===Evaluation===
Evaluation involves presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information, the validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. Its characteristics include:
*Judgments in terms of internal evidence
*Judgments in terms of external criteria

''Example'': Which kinds of apples are best for baking a pie, and why?

==The affective domain (emotion-based)&lt;!--linked from 'Aesthetics'--&gt;==
Skills in the affective domain describe the way people react [[emotion]]ally and their ability to feel other living things' pain or joy. Affective objectives typically target the awareness and growth in [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, emotion, and feelings.

There are five levels in the affective domain moving through the lowest-order processes to the highest.

===Receiving===
The lowest level; the student passively pays attention. Without this level, no learning can occur. Receiving is about the student's memory and recognition as well.

===Responding===
The student actively participates in the learning process, not only attends to a stimulus; the student also reacts in some way.

===Valuing===
The student attaches a value to an object, phenomenon, or piece of information. The student associates a value or some values to the knowledge they acquired.

===Organizing===
The student can put together different values, information, and ideas, and can accommodate them within his/her own schema; the student is comparing, relating and elaborating on what has been learned.

===Characterizing===
The student at this level tries to build abstract knowledge.

== The psychomotor domain (action-based) ==
Skills in the psychomotor domain describe the ability to physically manipulate a tool or instrument like a hand or a hammer. Psychomotor objectives usually focus on change and/or development in behavior and/or skills.

Bloom and his colleagues never created subcategories for skills in the psychomotor domain, but since then other educators have created their own psychomotor taxonomies.&lt;ref name="clark1999" /&gt; Simpson (1972)&lt;ref name= "simpson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=Elizabeth|title=Educational objectives in the psychomotor domain|date=1972|volume=3|pages=25–30|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED010368.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Gryphon House|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the following levels:

===Perception===
The ability to use sensory cues to guide motor activity:  This ranges from sensory stimulation, through cue selection, to translation.

''Examples'': Detects non-verbal communication cues. Estimate where a ball will land after it is thrown and then moving to the correct location to catch the ball. Adjusts heat of the stove to correct temperature by smell and taste of food. Adjusts the height of the forks on a forklift by comparing where the forks are in relation to the pallet.

''Key words'': chooses, describes, detects, differentiates, distinguishes, identifies, isolates, relates, selects.

===Set===
Readiness to act: It includes mental, physical, and emotional sets. These three sets are dispositions that predetermine a person's response to different situations (sometimes called mindsets). This subdivision of psychomotor is closely related with the "responding to phenomena" subdivision of the affective domain.

''Examples'': Knows and acts upon a sequence of steps in a manufacturing process. Recognizes his or her abilities and limitations. Shows desire to learn a new process (motivation).

''Keywords'': begins, displays, explains, moves, proceeds, reacts, shows, states, volunteers.

===Guided response===
The early stages of learning a complex skill that includes imitation and trial and error: Adequacy of performance is achieved by practicing.

''Examples'': Performs a mathematical equation as demonstrated. Follows instructions to build a model. Responds to hand-signals of the instructor while learning to operate a forklift.

''Keywords'': copies, traces, follows, react, reproduce, responds.

===Mechanism===
The intermediate stage in learning a complex skill: Learned responses have become habitual and the movements can be performed with some confidence and proficiency.

''Examples'': Use a personal computer. Repair a leaking tap. Drive a car.

''Key words'': assembles, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches.

===Complex overt response===
The skillful performance of motor acts that involve complex movement patterns: Proficiency is indicated by a quick, accurate, and highly coordinated performance, requiring a minimum of energy. This category includes performing without hesitation and automatic performance. For example, players will often utter sounds of satisfaction or expletives as soon as they hit a tennis ball or throw a football because they can tell by the feel of the act what the result will produce.

''Examples'': Maneuvers a car into a tight parallel parking spot. Operates a computer quickly and accurately. Displays competence while playing the piano.

''Key words'': assembles, builds, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches. (Note: The key words are the same as in mechanism, but will have adverbs or adjectives that indicate that the performance is quicker, better, more accurate, etc.)

===Adaptation===
Skills are well developed and the individual can modify movement patterns to fit special requirements.

''Examples'': Responds effectively to unexpected experiences. Modifies instruction to meet the needs of the learners. Performs a task with a machine that was not originally intended for that purpose (the machine is not damaged and there is no danger in performing the new task).

''Key words'': adapts, alters, changes, rearranges, reorganizes, revises, varies.

===Origination===
Creating new movement patterns to fit a particular situation or specific problem: Learning outcomes emphasize creativity based upon highly developed skills.

''Examples'': Constructs a new set or pattern of movements organized around a novel concept or theory. Develops a new and comprehensive training program. Creates a new gymnastic routine.

''Key words'': arranges, builds, combines, composes, constructs, creates, designs, initiate, makes, originates.

==Definition of knowledge==
In the appendix to ''Handbook I'', there is a definition of knowledge which serves as the apex for an alternative, summary classification of the educational goals. This is significant as the taxonomy has been called upon significantly in other fields such as knowledge management, potentially out of context. "Knowledge, as defined here, involves the recall of specifics and universals, the recall of methods and processes, or the recall of a pattern, structure, or setting."{{sfn|Bloom et al.|1956|p=201}}

The taxonomy is set out as follows:
*1.00 Knowledge
**1.10 Knowledge of specifics
**1.11 Knowledge of terminology
**1.12 Knowledge of specific facts
**1.20 Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics
**1.21 Knowledge of conventions
**1.22 Knowledge of trends and sequences
**1.23 Knowledge of classifications and categories
**1.24 Knowledge of criteria
**1.25 Knowledge of methodology
**1.30 Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field
**1.31 Knowledge of principles and generalizations
**1.32 Knowledge of theories and structures

==Criticism of the taxonomy==
As {{harvtxt|Morshead|1965}} pointed out on the publication of the second volume, the classification was not a properly constructed taxonomy, as it lacked a systemic rationale of construction.

This was subsequently acknowledged in the discussion of the original taxonomy in its 2001 revision,&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; and the taxonomy was reestablished on more systematic lines. 

Some critiques of the taxonomy's cognitive domain admit the existence of these six categories but question the existence of a sequential, hierarchical link.&lt;ref name="paul1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=R. |year=1993 |title=Critical thinking: what every person needs to survive in a rapidly changing world |edition=3rd |place=Rohnert Park, California |publisher=Sonoma State University Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, educators view the taxonomy as a hierarchy and may mistakenly dismiss the lowest levels as unworthy of teaching.&lt;ref name="Flannery"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flannery |first=Maura C. |date=November 2007 |title=Observations on biology |journal=[[The American Biology Teacher]] |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=561–564 |doi=10.1662/0002-7685(2007)69[561:OOB]2.0.CO;2 |url=https://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/File/pdfs/american_biology_teacher/2007/069-09-0561.pdf |quote=Biology is often referred to as an observational science almost as a slur, with the implication that biologists simply look at the living world without the strong theoretical and mathematic underpinnings of a science like physics. There is the suggestion that observation is easy. Thus biology is viewed as a lightweight science—anyone can do it: just go out and start looking, at birds, at grass, at cells under the microscope. Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy of learning tasks puts observation at the lowest level, with recall of information. This denigration of observation has long bothered me because I see it as often difficult and complex, a skill that needs to be learned and a talent that is much more developed in some.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Susan |date=26 February 2016 |title=Identification of animals and plants is an essential skill set |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |url=https://theconversation.com/identification-of-animals-and-plants-is-an-essential-skill-set-55450 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117044125/http://theconversation.com/identification-of-animals-and-plants-is-an-essential-skill-set-55450 |archivedate=17 November 2016 |accessdate=5 March 2017 |quote=Ironically, the dogma that has been so detrimental to field taxonomy is known as Bloom's taxonomy. University lecturers are told to apply an educational theory developed by Benjamin Bloom, which categorises assessment tasks and learning activities into cognitive domains. In Bloom's taxonomy, identifying and naming are at the lowest level of cognitive skills and have been systematically excluded from University degrees because they are considered simplistic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning of the lower levels enables the building of skills in the higher levels of the taxonomy, and in some fields, the most important skills are in the lower levels (such as identification of species of plants and animals in the field of [[natural history]]).&lt;ref name="Flannery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"/&gt; [[Instructional scaffolding]] of higher-level skills from lower-level skills is an application of [[Vygotskian]] [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name="vygotsky1978"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vygotsky |first=L. S. |author-link=Lev Vygotsky |year=1978 |title=Mind in society: the development of higher psychological processes |chapter=Chapter 6: Interaction between learning and development |pp=79–91 |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keene |first1=Judith |last2=Colvin |first2=John |last3=Sissons |first3=Justine |date=June 2010 |origyear=2010 |title=Mapping student information literacy activity against Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive skills |journal=Journal of Information Literacy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |doi=10.11645/4.1.189 |url=http://jil.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/article/view/PRA-V4-I1-2010-1 |quote=When supporting students outside the classroom situation, a subject aware advisor should be capable of spotting mistakes in a student's solution and of analysing these mistakes to identify the difficulty that the student is encountering. Such support can be seen as offering scaffolding in a student's 'zone of proximal development' (Vygotsky, 1978) and exemplified by teaching students to analyse a problem through the identification of the key elements and the relationships between these elements.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider the three lowest levels as hierarchically ordered, but the three higher levels as parallel.&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; Others say that it is sometimes better to move to Application before introducing concepts,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the idea is to create a learning environment where the real world context comes first and the theory second to promote the student's grasp of the phenomenon, concept or event. This 
thinking would seem to relate to the method of [[problem-based learning]].

Furthermore, the distinction between the categories can be seen as artificial since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. It could even be argued that any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fadul |first=J. A.|title=Collective Learning: Applying distributed cognition for collective intelligence|journal=The International Journal of Learning|volume=16 | issue =4 |pages=211–220 |issn=1447-9494|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general.

==Implications==
Bloom's taxonomy serves as the backbone of many teaching philosophies, in particular, those that lean more towards skills rather than content.&lt;ref name="krathwohl2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; These educators view content as a vessel for teaching skills. The emphasis on higher-order thinking inherent in such philosophies is based on the top levels of the taxonomy including analysis, evaluation, synthesis and creation. Bloom's taxonomy can be used as a teaching tool to help balance assessment and evaluative questions in class, assignments and texts to ensure all orders of thinking are exercised in students' learning, including aspects of information searching.&lt;ref&gt;BJ Jansen, D Booth, B Smith (2009) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_using_the_taxonomy_of_cognitive_learning_to_model_online_searching.pdf Using the taxonomy of cognitive learning to model online searching], Information Processing &amp; Management 45 (6), 643-663&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections across disciplines==
The skill development that takes place at these higher orders of thinking interacts well with a developing global focus on multiple literacies and modalities in learning and the emerging field of integrated disciplines.&lt;ref name="selander2012"&gt;*{{cite journal |last1=Kress |first1=G. |last2=Selander |first2=S. |year=2012 |title=Multimodal design, learning and cultures of recognition |journal=Internet and Higher Education |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=265–268 |doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.12.003 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to interface with and create media would draw upon skills from multiple levels of the taxonomy including analysis, application and creation.&lt;ref name="paul2004"&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1=R. |last2=Elder |first2=L. |year=2004 |title=Critical and creative thinking |place=Dillon Beach, CA |publisher=The Foundation for Critical Thinking |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="london1996"&gt;*{{cite book |author=The New London Group |year=1996 |title=A pedagogy of multiliteracies: designing social futures |publisher=Harvard Educational Review |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom's taxonomy (and the revised taxonomy) continues to be a source of inspiration for educational philosophy and for developing new teaching strategies.

A '''bomb suit''', '''Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) suit''' or a '''blast suit''' is a heavy suit of body armor designed to withstand the pressure generated by a [[bomb]] and any fragments the bomb may produce.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Physiological Tolerance Times while Wearing Explosive Ordnance Disposal Protective Clothing in Simulated Environmental Extremes|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0083740|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-02-21|pmc = 3931617|pmid = 24586228|pages = e83740|volume = 9|issue = 2|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0083740|first = Ian B.|last = Stewart|first2 = Kelly L.|last2 = Stewart|first3 = Charles J.|last3 = Worringham|first4 = Joseph T.|last4 = Costello}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inside the 'Hurt Locker': The Combined Effects of Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Chemical Protective Clothing on Physiological Tolerance Time in Extreme Environments|journal = The Annals of Occupational Hygiene|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 1475-3162|pmid = 25878167|pages = 922–931|volume = 59|issue = 7|doi = 10.1093/annhyg/mev029|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Kelly L.|last2 = Stewart|first3 = Ian B.|last3 = Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effects of metabolic work rate and ambient environment on physiological tolerance times while wearing explosive and chemical personal protective equipment|journal = BioMed Research International|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 2314-6141|pmc = 4383354|pmid = 25866818|pages = 857536|volume = 2015|doi = 10.1155/2015/857536|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Kelly L.|last2 = Stewart|first3 = Ian B.|last3 = Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually worn by trained personnel attempting [[bomb disposal]]. In contrast to [[Personal armor|ballistic body armors]], which usually focus on protecting the torso and head, a bomb suit must protect all parts of the body, since the dangers posed by a bomb's [[explosion]] affect the entire body.

Parts of the bomb suit overlap for maximum protection. The suit protects in several different ways. It deflects or stops projectiles that may come from an exploded device.  It also stops or greatly decreases the pressure of the blast wave being transmitted to the person inside of the suit. Most bomb suits, such as the [[Advanced Bomb Suit]] use layers of [[Kevlar]], foam, and plastic to accomplish these functions.

In order to maximize protection, bomb suits come with a pair of Interchangeable gloves and wrist guard attachments. This gives the wearer's hands mobility and protection needed for the task; as well as avoiding cross contamination of any evidence found (fingerprints). 

[[Explosive Ordnance Disposal|EOD]] technicians wear bomb suits during reconnaissance, 'render safe' or disruption procedures on potential or confirmed explosive threats. Such suits must provide a tremendous degree of protection from fragmentation, blast overpressure, thermal and tertiary effects should the threat device detonate. At the same time the suit can significantly hinder their mobility or [[situation awareness|situational awareness]].

==History==
Modern day EOD units had their beginnings in World War II, when the German [[Luftwaffe]] greatly increased the number of bombs dropped on British soil.  As the number of civilian casualties grew due to delayed explosion of bombs, which had often penetrated several feet into the ground after being dropped from planes, men were trained to defuse the unexploded devices and groups were dedicated try to keep up with that task.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bombdisposalclub.org.uk/BD_history.htm A short history of Royal Engineer Bomb Disposal] posted by The Royal Engineers Bomb Disposal Officers Club (U.K.), accessed 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As fuse designs changed, many of these early UXD (unexploded device) soldiers died until more successful means to defeat a new design were developed.

As the United States saw its likely involvement in World War II, they requested help from the British to train a civilian EOD force that could defuse unexploded bombs in urban areas. The human cost of learning the variety of fuses and how to defeat them was lower for the U.S. due to this education. After it became clear that EOD tasks were best handled by the military, the U.S. tried several ways to organize EOD personnel that would allow for the need for both specialized training and diverse deployment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nateoda.org/history.htm A short history of the beginnings of the U.S. EOD] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402214335/http://www.nateoda.org/history.htm |date=April 2, 2012 }} posted by the National EOD Association, accessed 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.753eod.com/history.aspx A short history of American EOD] recounted by The Origins of U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal by CSM James H. Clifford (Ret.), accessed 26 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A bomb disposal party working on an enemy weapon dropped near Algiers, November 1942. A13089.jpg|thumb|left|An unprotected bomb disposal party working on an enemy weapon dropped near Algiers, November 1942.]]
In photos of early missions to defuse unexploded bombs,&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, [http://okinawarelics.com/Documents/History%20By%20Bart%20Part%201.pdf A WWII bomb disposal case history], accessed 30 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the men are not wearing any protective gear.  In fact, they are often shirtless to cope with the heat generated by the manual labor of digging around the devices before they could be defused. Basically, the individual defusing the bomb succeeded - or failed with fatal results.

The first EOD suits consisted of [[Kevlar]] type material and/or armor plates made of metal or fiber-reinforced plastic.  Their purpose was to protect the wearer from penetrating injuries by fragments from an exploding device. In the mid-1990s, research showed that these materials alone were not effective against the blast wave itself, which can cause [[blast lung]] and other potentially deadly internal injuries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = G | year = 1996 | title = Protection of the lung from blast overpressure by thoracic stress wave decouplers | doi = 10.1097/00005373-199603001-00024 | journal = J Trauma | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = S105–S110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern EOD suits have layers of Kevlar, plating, and foam to provide protection from both fragments and the blast wave itself.

The threats posed by an Improvised Explosive Device, commonly known as an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]], can also include [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|chemical or biological]] agents.  This has led to significant advancements since 1999 in the design of bomb disposal suits and helmets.  For example, a modern bomb suit may address both conventional blast threats and chemical/biological agents by incorporating a chemical protective undergarment and a helmet compatible with a [[Self-contained breathing apparatus| Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)]]

Recently, the U.S. [[National Institute of Justice]] supported a program to develop a national testing standard for EOD suits so that the protection afforded by a given suit can be described in a standard way.&lt;ref&gt;Waclawik, S. Explosive Ordnance Disposal Personal Protective Equipment (EOD PPE) Standard. Presentation by the Ballistic Technology Team, Natick Soldier Center, Natick, Massachusetts, USA. [http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=477695 read online]&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal is to have a means to compare the performance of different designs with each other and with expected threats, similar to the [[Ballistic vest#Performance standards|NIJ standards]] that are widely used to test and compare body armor or materials used to stop ballistic threats.

Developers must consider more than just protection, since a person must work on a stressful task that also requires fine motor skills while wearing a bomb suit. Other factors that must be considered include
* cushioning the spine and head in case the wearer is knocked over by a blast
* thermal heat protection&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* freedom of motion to work efficiently&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* maximum weight restrictions
* rapid removal, such as for emergency medical treatment
* defogger performance to prevent the helmet visor from clouding

==Protection==

[[File:Aviano bomb suit.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[Advanced Bomb Suit]] worn by an EOD officer in the [[31st Fighter Wing|31st Civil Engineer Squadron]] of the [[United States Air Force]].]]

The pieces of a bomb suit overlap with other pieces for maximum protection whether the wearer is facing toward or away from an explosive device.  The suit protects in several ways. It deflects or stops projectiles that may come from an exploded device.  The second way it protects is by stopping the blast wave from being transmitted and injuring the wearer. Usually, Kevlar, foam, and plastic are layered and covered with fire retardant materials to accomplish these things. It is important that the fibers are strain-rate sensitive, or become more rigid if struck by an object traveling at high speeds, according to a ballistics engineer working for bomb suit manufacturer [[HighCom Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.dvice.com/archives/2010/03/hurt-locker-sui.php |publisher= dvice|title= Real-life Hurt Locker: how bomb-proof suits work|accessdate=October 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-1990s, EOD suits consisted of Kevlar and/or armor plates to stop projectiles.  However, the suits did not offer much protection against the blast wave itself.  The most recognized injury due to the blast wave is called [[Pulmonary contusion|“blast lung.”]] The lungs (and other internal organs) can be injured by the blast wave and bleed, even when there is no penetrating injury; such internal injuries can be fatal. In the mid-1990s, research conducted in the U.K. showed that textile and rigid plate armor by themselves do not protect the lungs from blast injury.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was found that a layer with high [[acoustic impedance]] with a backing of a softer, low acoustic impedance layer (such as low density foam) would protect from blast injury. However, it was also shown that it is important to understand the frequency content of the applied blast wave and to experimentally test the way materials are put together to make sure they are effective.

==Ergonomic issues==

To effectively stop a blast wave, thick layers of Kevlar, foam and plastic are needed to prevent serious bodily harm.  Since the entire body needs protection, the resulting bomb suit can be heavy (up to 81&amp;nbsp;lbs or more), hot to the point of causing [[heat stress]], and can impair movement.  Therefore, often one individual will put on a suit to approach a device for defusing after it has been identified.  The weight of the suit is often a tradeoff with the amount of protection it can provide.  A range of bomb suits are thus available so that agencies can choose the needed protection without unnecessary weight when possible. A minimal suit consists of a jacket, apron and helmet that weigh as little as 11&amp;nbsp;lbs.  These are listed as being suitable for [[demining]] activities but not EOD.

[[File:US Navy 110810-N-OT964-111 Sailors puts on a bomb suit during an emergency response training.jpg|thumb|Heat stress can be a problem]]
The materials needed to make bomb suits protective do not release body heat generated by the wearer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The result can be heat stress, which can lead to illness and disorientation, reducing the wearer’s ability to accomplish the task.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Ian B.; Rojek, Amanda M.; Hunt, Andrew P. Heat Strain During Explosive Ordnance Disposal. Military Medicine, Volume 176, Number 8, August 2011 , pp. 959-963.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent models of bomb suits include battery-operated cooling systems to prevent heat stress.  One manufacturer’s study claims that the internal cooling systems on 39&amp;nbsp;lbs and 81&amp;nbsp;lbs bomb suits helped the wearer stay at workable temperatures for up to an hour, even in a hot environment.&lt;ref&gt;Thake, C.D., et al., A thermal physiological comparison between two Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) suits during work related activities in moderate and hot conditions.

'''Brise soleil''', sometimes '''brise-soleil''' ({{IPA-fr|bʁiːz sɔlɛj}}, plural, "brise-soleil" (invariable), or "bris-ole", from [[French language|French]], "sun breaker"), is an [[Architecture|architectural]] feature of a building that reduces [[solar gain|heat gain]] within that building by deflecting sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Matter: Material Processes in Architectural Production|last = |first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 330|editor-last = Peter Borden|editor-first = Gail|editor2-last = Meredith|editor2-first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Brise-soleils can comprise a variety of permanent [[sun shade|sun-shading]] structures, ranging from the simple patterned concrete walls popularized by [[Le Corbusier]] in the [[Palace of Assembly (Chandigarh)|Palace of Assembly]] to the elaborate wing-like mechanism devised by [[Santiago Calatrava]] for the [[Milwaukee Art Museum]] or the mechanical, pattern-creating devices of the [[Institut du Monde Arabe]] by [[Jean Nouvel]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In the typical form, a horizontal projection extends from the sunside facade of a building. This is most commonly used to prevent facades with a large amount of glass from overheating during the summer. Often [[louver]]s are incorporated into the shade to prevent the high-angle summer sun falling on the facade, but also to allow the low-angle winter sun to provide some [[passive solar heating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionary of Construction Terms|last = Tolson|first = Simon|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 40|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JPVfAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=brise%20soleil&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=brise%20soleil&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Agricultural Revolution''', or '''Second Agricultural Revolution''', was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in Britain due to increases in labour and land productivity between the mid-17th and late 19th centuries. Agricultural output grew faster than the population over the century to 1770, and thereafter productivity remained among the highest in the world. This increase in the food supply contributed to the rapid growth of population in England and Wales, from 5.5 million in 1700 to over 9 million by 1801, though domestic production gave way increasingly to food imports in the nineteenth century as population more than tripled to over 32 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Denis|last2=Hunt|first2=J.W.|title=An Illustrated History of Modern Britain: 1783-1980|date=1983|publisher=Longman Group UK LTD|location=Hong Kong|isbn=0-582-33130-7|page=7|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise in productivity accelerated the decline of the agricultural share of the labour force, adding to the urban workforce on which industrialization depended: the Agricultural Revolution has therefore been cited as a cause of the [[Industrial Revolution]].

However, historians continue to dispute when exactly such a "revolution" took place and of what it consisted. Rather than a single event, G. E. Mingay states that there were a "profusion of agricultural revolutions, one for two centuries before 1750, another emphasising the century after 1650, a third for the period 1750-1880, and a fourth for the middle decades of the nineteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Mingay (ed), The Agricultural Revolution: Changes in Agriculture 1650-1880 (1977), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; This has led more recent historians to argue that any general statements about "the Agricultural Revolution" are difficult to sustain.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jones, Agricultural Enlightenment: Knowledge, Technology, and Nature, 1750-1840 (2016), p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Joel Mokry, The Enlightened Economy: Britain and the Industrial Revolution 1700-1850 (2009), p.173&lt;/ref&gt; 

One important change in farming methods was the move in crop rotation to [[turnip]]s and [[clover]] in place of fallow. Turnips can be grown in winter and are deep-rooted, allowing them to gather minerals unavailable to shallow-rooted crops. Clover [[Nitrogen fixation|fixes nitrogen]] from the atmosphere into a form of fertiliser. This permitted the intensive arable cultivation of light soils on enclosed farms and provided fodder to support increased livestock numbers whose manure added further to soil fertility.

==Major developments and innovations==
The British Agricultural Revolution was the result of the complex interaction of social, economic and farming technology changes.  Major developments and innovations include:&lt;ref name="Overton 1996 1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important innovations of the British Agricultural Revolution was the development of the Norfolk four-course rotation, which greatly increased crop and livestock yields by improving soil fertility and reducing fallow.&lt;ref name="Overton 1996 1"/&gt;

[[Crop rotation]] is the practice of growing a series of dissimilar types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons to help restore plant nutrients and mitigate the build-up of pathogens and pests that often occurs when one plant species is continuously cropped.  Rotation can also improve soil structure and fertility by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants.  Turnip roots, for example, can recover nutrients from deep under the soil.  The Norfolk System, as it is now known, rotates crops so that different crops are planted with the result that different kinds and quantities of nutrients are taken from the soil as the plants grow.  An important feature of the Norfolk four-field system was that it used labour at times when demand was not at peak levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Planting cover crops such as turnips and clover was not permitted under the [[Common land|common field system]] because they interfered with access to the fields.  Besides, other people's livestock could graze the turnips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[open field system]] had initially used a two-field crop rotation system where one field was left fallow or turned into pasture for a time to try to recover some of its plant nutrients. Later they employed a three-year, three field crop rotation routine, with a different crop in each of two fields, e.g. oats, rye, wheat, and barley with the second field growing a legume like peas or beans, and the third field [[fallow]]. Normally from 10–30% of the arable land in a three crop rotation system is fallow. Each field was rotated into a different crop nearly every year. Over the following two centuries, the regular planting of [[legumes]] such as peas and beans in the fields that were previously fallow slowly restored the [[Soil fertility|fertility]] of some croplands. The planting of legumes helped to increase plant growth in the empty field due to the [[bacteria]] on legume roots' ability to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the air into the soil in a form that plants could use. Other crops that were occasionally grown were [[flax]] and members of the [[mustard family]].

[[Convertible husbandry]] was the alternation of a field between pasture and grain.  Because nitrogen builds up slowly over time in pasture, ploughing up pasture and planting grains resulted in high yields for a few years.  A big disadvantage of convertible husbandry was the hard work in breaking up pastures and difficulty in establishing them.  The significance of convertible husbandry is that it introduced pasture into the rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|p0=116, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The farmers in [[Flanders]] (in parts of [[France]] and current day [[Belgium]]) discovered a still more effective four-field crop rotation system, using [[turnip]]s and [[clover]] (a legume) as forage crops to replace the three-year crop rotation fallow year.

The four-field rotation system allowed farmers to restore soil fertility and restore some of the [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] removed with the crops. Turnips first show up in the probate records in England as early as 1638 but were not widely used till about 1750. Fallow land was about 20% of the arable area in England in 1700 before turnips and clover were extensively grown.  Guano and nitrates from South America were introduced in the mid-19th century and fallow steadily declined to reach only about 4% in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Fallow Land [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/agricultural_revolution_01.shtml] Accessed 20 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, wheat, barley, turnips and clover would be planted in that order in each field in successive years. The turnips helped keep the weeds down and were an excellent forage crop—ruminant animals could eat their tops and roots through a large part of the summer and winters. There was no need to let the soil lie fallow as clover would re-add nitrates (nitrogen-containing salts) back to the soil. The clover made excellent pasture and hay fields as well as [[green manure]] when it was ploughed under after one or two years. The addition of clover and turnips allowed more animals to be kept through the winter, which in turn produced more milk, cheese, meat and manure, which maintained soil fertility. This maintains a good amount of crops produced.

The mix of crops also changed: the area under wheat rose by 1870 to 3.5 million acres (1.4m ha), barley to 2.25m acres (0.9m ha) and oats less dramatically to 2.75m acres (1.1m ha), while rye dwindled to 60,000 acres (25,000 ha), less than a tenth of its late medieval peak. Grain yields benefited from new and better seed alongside improved rotation and fertility: wheat yields increased by a quarter in the 18th century{{sfn|Overton|1996|p=77}} and nearly half in the 19th, averaging 30 bushels per acre (2,080&amp;nbsp;kg/ha) by the 1890s.

===The Dutch and Rotherham swing (wheel-less) plough===
The Dutch acquired the iron-tipped, curved [[plough#Mouldboard plough|mouldboard]], adjustable depth [[plough]] from the Chinese in the early 17th century.  It had the advantage of being able to be pulled by one or two oxen compared to the six or eight needed by the heavy wheeled northern European plough.  The Dutch plough was brought to Britain by Dutch contractors who were hired to drain East Anglian fens and Somerset moors.  The plough was extremely successful on wet, boggy soil, but was soon used on ordinary land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|pp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Temple 1986 18, 20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|pp=18, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British improvements included Joseph Foljambe's cast iron plough (patented 1730), which combined an earlier Dutch design with a number of innovations. Its fittings and coulter were made of iron and the mouldboard and share were covered with an iron plate, making it easier to pull and more controllable than previous ploughs.  By the 1760s Foljambe was making large numbers of these ploughs in a factory outside of Rotherham, England, using standard patterns with interchangeable parts.  The plough was easy for a blacksmith to make, but by the end of the 18th century it was being made in rural foundries.&lt;ref name="Temple 1986 18, 20"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rotherhamunofficial.co.uk/history/18th/plough.html |title=The Rotherham Plough |publisher=Rotherham: The Unofficial Website |accessdate=17 May 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814194740/http://www.rotherhamunofficial.co.uk/history/18th/plough.html |archivedate=14 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm |title=The Rotherham Plough |publisher=Rotherham.co.uk |accessdate=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924092217/http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm |archive-date=24 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1770 it was the cheapest and best plough available.

===Enclosure===
{{See also|Enclosure|Common land|Tragedy of the commons}}
[[File:Plan mediaeval manor.jpg|thumb|300px|Conjectural map of a mediaeval English [[manor]]. The part allocated to "common pasture" is shown in the north-east section, shaded green.]]

In Europe, [[agriculture]] was [[feudal]] from the [[Middle Ages]]. In the traditional [[open field system]], many subsistence farmers cropped strips of land in large fields held in common and divided the produce. They typically worked under the auspices of the [[aristocracy]] or the [[Catholic Church]], who owned much of the land.

As early as the 12th century, some fields in England tilled under the open field system were enclosed into individually owned fields. The [[Black Death]] from 1348 onward accelerated the break-up of the feudal system in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unbound Prometheus: Technological Change and Industrial Development in Western Europe from 1750 to the Present |last=Landes |first=David S. |year=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-09418-6 |pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many farms were bought by [[yeomen]] who enclosed their property and improved their use of the land. More secure control of the land allowed the owners to make innovations that improved their yields. Other husbandmen rented property they "[[share cropping|share cropped]]" with the land owners. Many of these enclosures were accomplished by acts of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in the 16th and 17th centuries.

The process of enclosing property accelerated in the 15th and 16th centuries. The more productive enclosed farms meant that fewer farmers were needed to work the same land, leaving many villagers without land and [[grazing rights]]. Many of them moved to the cities in search of work in the emerging factories of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Others settled in the English colonies. [[English Poor Laws]] were enacted to help these newly poor.

Some practices of enclosure were denounced by the Church, and legislation was drawn up against it; but the large, enclosed fields were needed for the gains in agricultural productivity from the 16th to 18th centuries. This controversy led to a series of government acts, culminating in the [[Enclosure Act|General Enclosure Act]] of 1801 which sanctioned large-scale [[land reform]].

The process of enclosure was largely complete by the end of the 18th century.

===Development of a national market===
Markets were widespread by 1500 with about 800 locations in Britain.  These were regulated and not free.  The most important development between the 16th century and the mid-19th century was the development of private marketing.  By the 19th century, marketing was nationwide and the vast majority of agricultural production was for market rather than for the farmer and his family.  The 16th-century market radius was about 10 miles, which could support a town of 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|pp=134–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The next stage of development was trading between markets, requiring merchants, credit and forward sales, knowledge of markets and pricing and of supply and demand in different markets.  Eventually, the market evolved into a national one driven by London and other growing cities.  By 1700, there was a national market for wheat.

Legislation regulating middlemen required registration, addressed weights and measures, fixing of prices and collection of tolls by the government.  Market regulations were eased in 1663 when people were allowed some self-regulation to hold inventory, but it was forbidden to withhold commodities from the market in an effort to increase prices.  In the late 18th century, the idea of self-regulation was gaining acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|pp=135, 145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of internal tariffs, customs barriers and feudal tolls made Britain "the largest coherent market in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation infrastructures===
High wagon transportation costs made it uneconomical to ship commodities very far outside the market radius by road, generally limiting shipment to less than 20 or 30 miles to market or to a navigable waterway.  Water transport was, and in some cases still is, much more efficient than land transport.  In the early 19th century it cost as much to transport a ton of freight 32 miles by wagon over an unimproved road as it did to ship it 3000 miles across the Atlantic.&lt;ref &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  A horse could pull at most one ton of freight on a [[Macadam]] road, which was multi-layer stone covered and crowned, with side drainage.  But a single horse could pull a barge weighing over 30 tons.

Commerce was aided by the expansion of roads and inland waterways.  Road transport capacity grew from threefold to fourfold from 1500 to 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|pp=137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grubler | first1=Arnulf | title=The Rise and Fall of Infrastructures: Dynamics of Evolution and Technological Change in transport | year=1990 |publisher=Physica-Verlag |location= Heidelberg and New York |isbn= |pages= | url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/XB-90-704.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads would eventually reduce the cost of land transport by over 95%; however they did not become important until after 1850.

===Land conversion, drainage and reclamation===
Another way to get more land was to convert some pasture land into arable land and recover fen land and some pastures. It is estimated that the amount of arable land in Britain grew by 10–30% through these land conversions.

The British Agricultural Revolution was aided by land maintenance advancements in Flanders and the Netherlands. Due to the large and dense population of Flanders and Holland, farmers there were forced to take maximum advantage of every bit of usable land; the country had become a pioneer in canal building, soil restoration and maintenance, soil drainage, and land reclamation technology. Dutch experts like Cornelius Vermuyden brought some of this technology to Britain.

Water-meadows were utilised in the late 16th to the 20th centuries and allowed earlier pasturing of livestock after they were wintered on hay. This increased livestock yields, giving more hides, meat, milk, and manure as well as better hay crops.

===Rise in domestic farmers===
With the development of regional markets and eventually a national market, aided by improved transportation infrastructures, farmers were no longer dependent on their local market and were less subject to having to sell at low prices into an oversupplied local market and not being able to sell their surpluses to distant localities that were experiencing shortages.  They also became less subject to price fixing regulations.  Farming became a business rather than solely a means of subsistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Overton|1996|pp=205–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under free market capitalism, farmers had to remain competitive.  To be successful, farmers had to become effective managers who incorporated the latest farming innovations in order to be low cost producers.

===Selective breeding of livestock===
In England, [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]] and [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke]] introduced [[selective breeding]] as a scientific practice, mating together two animals with particularly desirable characteristics, and also using [[inbreeding]] or the mating of close relatives, such as father and daughter, or brother and sister, to stabilise certain qualities in order to reduce genetic diversity in desirable animal programmes from the mid-18th century. Arguably, Bakewell's most important breeding programme was with sheep. Using native stock, he was able to quickly select for large, yet fine-boned sheep, with long, lustrous wool. The [[Lincoln (sheep)|Lincoln Longwool]] was improved by Bakewell, and in turn the Lincoln was used to develop the subsequent breed, named the New (or Dishley) Leicester. It was [[Polled livestock|hornless]] and had a square, meaty body with straight top lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Bakewell (1725 - 1795)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/bakewell_robert.shtml|publisher=BBC History|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bakewell was also the first to breed cattle to be used primarily for beef. Previously, cattle were first and foremost kept for pulling [[plough]]s as [[oxen]] or for dairy uses, with beef from surplus males as an additional bonus, but he crossed long-horned heifers and a Westmoreland bull to eventually create the [[English Longhorn|Dishley Longhorn]]. As more and more farmers followed his lead, farm animals increased dramatically in size and quality. The average weight of a [[bull]] sold for slaughter at Smithfield was reported around 1700 as 370 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (170&amp;nbsp;kg), though this is considered a low estimate: by 1786, weights of 840 pounds (380&amp;nbsp;kg) were reported,&lt;ref&gt;John R. Walton, "The diffusion of the improved Shorthorn breed of cattle in Britain during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." ''Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers'' (1984): 22-36. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/621865 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John R. Walton, "Pedigree and the national cattle herd circa 1750–1950." ''Agricultural History Review'' (1986): 149-170. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40274467 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; though other contemporary indicators suggest an increase of around a quarter over the intervening century.

==British agriculture 1800–1900==
Besides the organic fertilisers in manure, new fertilisers were slowly discovered. Massive [[sodium nitrate]] (NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) deposits found in the [[Atacama Desert]], [[Chile]], were brought under British financiers like [[John Thomas North]] and imports were started. Chile was happy to allow the exports of these sodium nitrates by allowing the British to use their capital to develop the mining and imposing a hefty export tax to enrich their treasury. Massive deposits of sea bird [[guano]] (11–16% N, 8–12% [[phosphate]], and 2–3% [[potash]]), were found and started to be imported after about 1830. Significant imports of [[potash]] obtained from the ashes of trees burned in opening new agricultural lands were imported. By-products of the British [[meat industry]] like bones from the [[knacker]]s' yards were ground up or crushed and sold as fertiliser. By about 1840 about 30,000 tons of bones were being processed (worth about £150,000). An unusual alternative to bones was found to be the millions of tons of fossils called [[coprolite]]s found in South East England. When these were dissolved in [[sulphuric acid]] they yielded a high [[phosphate]] mixture (called "super phosphate") that plants could absorb readily and increased crop yields. Mining [[coprolite]] and processing it for fertiliser soon developed into a major industry—the first commercial fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2014-5%20-%20The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20British%20.pdf Coprolite Fertilizer Industry in Britain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715060818/http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2014-5%20-%20The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20British%20.pdf |date=2011-07-15 }}. Accessed 3 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Higher yield per acre crops were also planted as potatoes went from about 300,000 acres in 1800 to about 400,000 acres in 1850 with a further increase to about 500,000 in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/allen/unpublished/AllenE&amp;W.pdf British food puzzle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415165314/http://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/users/allen/unpublished/AllenE%26W.pdf# |date=2012-04-15 }}. Accessed 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Labour productivity slowly increased at about 0.6% per year. With more capital invested, more organic and inorganic fertilisers, and better crop yields increased the food grown at about 0.5%/year—not enough to keep up with population growth.

Great Britain contained about 10.8 million people in 1801, 20.7 million in 1851 and 37.1 million by 1901. This corresponds to an annual population growth rate of 1.3% in 1801-1851 and 1.2% in 1851-1901, twice the rate of agricultural output growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basvanleeuwen.net/bestanden/agriclongrun1250to1850.pdf "English Agricultural Output and Labour Productivity, 1250–1850: Some Preliminary Estimates"]. Accessed 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to land for cultivation there was also a demand for pasture land to support more livestock. The growth of arable acreage slowed from the 1830s and went into reverse from the 1870s in the face of cheaper grain imports, and wheat acreage nearly halved from 1870 to 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_LAND&amp;data_cube=N_AGCEN_FARM&amp;u_id=10061325&amp;c_id=&amp;add=Y British Agricultural Statistics]. Accessed 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovery of food imports after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–1815) and the resumption of American trade following the [[War of 1812]] (1812–1815) led to the enactment in 1815 of the [[Corn Laws]] (protective tariffs) to protect [[cereal]] grain producers in Britain against foreign competition. These laws were only removed in 1846 after the onset of the [[Irish Potato Famine]] in which [[Phytophthora infestans|potato late blight]] &lt;ref&gt;http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Potato_LateBlt.htm. Accessed 6 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ruined most of the Irish potato crop and brought famine to the Irish people in 1846–50. Though the blight also struck Scotland, Wales, England, and much of Europe, its effect there was far less severe since potatoes constituted a much smaller percentage of the diet than in Ireland. In addition many Britons could afford to buy specially-imported food from other countries — the famine-stricken Irish were too poor to do this. Hundreds of thousands died in the Irish famine and millions more emigrated to England, Wales, Scotland, Canada, Australia, Europe, and the United States, reducing the population from about 8.5 million in 1845 to 4.3 million by 1921.

Between 1873 and 1879 British agriculture suffered from wet summers that damaged grain crops. Cattle farmers were hit by foot-and-mouth disease, and sheep farmers by sheep liver rot. The poor harvests, however, masked a greater threat to British agriculture: growing imports of foodstuffs from abroad. The development of the [[steam ship]] and the development of extensive railway networks in Britain and the USA allowed US farmers with much larger and more productive farms to export hard grain to Britain at a price that undercut the British farmers. At the same time, large amounts of cheap [[corned beef]] started to arrive from [[Argentina]], and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 and the development of [[refrigerator ship]]s (reefers) in about 1880 opened the British market to cheap meat and [[wool]] from [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Argentina]]. The [[Long Depression]] was a worldwide economic recession that began in 1873 and ended around 1896. It hit the [[Great Depression of British Agriculture|agricultural sector]] hard and was the most severe in Europe and the United States, which had been experiencing strong economic growth fuelled by the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] in the decade following the [[American Civil War]]. By 1900 half the meat eaten in Britain came from abroad and tropical fruits such as bananas were also being imported on the new refrigerator ships.
&lt;!--
===Ploughing===
[[Plough]]s advanced from a forked wooden stick making a [[furrow]] (often called a hog plough because they root in and out of the ground) to an iron tipped wooden plough initially pulled mostly by oxen. Depending on the type of soil, a typical team of 2–6 oxen and 1–4 men could plough about one acre per day. Many crops required ploughing up to three times in a season to prepare the fields for planting. Joseph Foljambe's Rotherham cast iron plough of 1730, combining an earlier Dutch design with a number of technological innovations, was the first iron plough to have any commercial success in Europe. Its fittings and [[Coulter (agriculture)|coulter]] were made of iron and the mouldboard and [[Ploughshare|share]] were covered with an iron plate, making it lighter to pull and more controllable than previous ploughs. It remained in limited use in Britain until the development of the [[tractor]]. It was followed by [[James Small (inventor)|James Small]] of [[Doncaster]] and [[Berwickshire]] in 1763, whose "Scots Plough" used an improved cast iron share to turn the soil more effectively with less draft, wear, or strain on the ploughing team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rotherhamweb.co.uk/h/plough.htm The Rotherham Plough]&lt;/ref&gt; Most teams pulling ploughs converted to horse drawn ploughs sometime after 1850. [[John Deere]]'s self-polishing steel plough, invented in about 1837 in America, was used on some difficult soils or pasture land. Robert Ransome's plough factory of [[Ipswich, England]] was producing 86 different plough models designed for particular soils.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Robert Stockes. ''300 Years of Farm Implements and Machinery 1630–1930''. Krause Publications (2003). p. 33. {{ISBN|978-0873496322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

===Seed planting===
Before the introduction of the [[seed drill]], the common practice was to plant seeds by broadcasting (evenly throwing) them across the ground by hand on the prepared soil and then lightly harrowing the soil to cover the seed.  Seeds left on top of the ground were eaten by birds, insects, and mice.  There was no control over spacing and seeds were planted too close together and too far apart.  Alternately seeds could be laboriously planted one by one using a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]] and/or a shovel.  Cutting down on wasted seed was important because the yield of seeds harvested to seeds planted at that time was around four or five.

The seed drill was introduced from China to Italy in the mid-16th century where it was patented by the Venetian Senate.&lt;ref name="Temple_1986"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple |first1= Robert |year=1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] invented an improved seed drill in 1701.  It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and at the correct depth.  Tull's seed drill was very expensive and fragile and therefore did not have much of an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Temple|1986|pp=20-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology to manufacture affordable and reliable machinery, including agricultural machines, improved dramatically in the last half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hounshell1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The Agricultural Revolution was part of a long process of improvement, but sound advice on farming began to appear in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as [[Samuel Hartlib]], [[Walter Blith]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;Thirsk. 'Walter Blith' in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edn, Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and the overall agricultural productivity of Britain started to grow significantly only in the period of the Agricultural Revolution. It is estimated that total agricultural output grew 2.7-fold between 1700 and 1870 and output per worker at a similar rate.

Despite its name, the Agricultural Revolution in Britain did not result in overall productivity per hectare of agricultural area as high as in China, where intensive cultivation (including multiple annual cropping in many areas) had been practised for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last1=Merson |first1= John |authorlink=|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7 |pages=23–6| postscript = A companion to the PBS Series “The Genius That Was China”}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention|last1=Temple |first1= Robert |author2=Joseph Needham |year= 1986| publisher = Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |page=26 | postscript = Temple estimates Chinese crop yields were between 10 and twenty times higher than in the West. This is not the case. Perkins finds an average Chinese grain yield about twice the late 18th-century European average. China's advantage was in intensive land use and high labour inputs, rather than in individual crop yields (except for rice, suited only to some parts of Mediterranean Europe).}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agricultural Revolution in Britain proved to be a major turning point in history, allowing population to far exceed earlier peaks and sustain the country's rise to industrial pre-eminence. Towards the end of the 19th century, the substantial gains in [[British people|British]] agricultural productivity were rapidly offset by competition from cheaper imports, made possible by the exploitation of new lands and advances in transportation, refrigeration, and other technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14138">[[Image:Riesling grapes leaves.jpg|right|thumb|In [[Alsace]], chaptalization is often used to boost the alcohol level of [[Riesling]] grapes that have not fully ripened on the vine.]]
'''Chaptalization''' is the process of adding [[sugar]] to unfermented [[grape]] [[must]] in order to increase the [[alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] after [[Fermentation (wine)|fermentation]]. The technique is named after its developer, the French [[chemist]] [[Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal]].&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 47"&gt;{{cite book | author=MacNeil, K | title=The Wine Bible | publisher=Workman Publishing | year=2001 | isbn=1-56305-434-5 | page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is not intended to make the wine [[Sweetness of wine|sweeter]], but rather to provide more sugar for the [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] to ferment into alcohol.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 47"/&gt;

Chaptalization has generated controversy and discontent in the [[French wine]] industry due to advantages that the process is perceived to give producers in poor-climate areas. In response to violent demonstrations by protesters in 1907, the French government began regulating the amount of sugar that can be added to wine.

Chaptalization is sometimes referred to as '''enrichment''', for example in the [[European Union wine regulations]] specifying the legality of the practice within EU.&lt;ref name="CMO 08"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:148:0001:0061:EN:PDF | title=Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 on the common organisation of the market in wine | format=PDF | journal=Official Journal of the European Union | date=2008-06-06 | accessdate=2008-11-21 | pages=148/52–54 (Annex V)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality of chaptalization varies by country, region, and even wine type. In general, it is legal in regions that produce grapes with low sugar content. Chaptalization is prohibited in Argentina, Australia, California, Italy, Spain and South Africa. Germany prohibits the practice for making [[Prädikatswein]]. It is generally permitted in regions where grapes tend to have low sugar content, including Northern regions of France, Germany, and the United States.

==History==
[[Image:Jean-Antoine Chaptal.jpg|left|thumb|French chemist Jean-Antoine Chaptal]]
The technique of adding sugar to grape [[must]] has been part of the process of winemaking since the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] added [[honey]] as a sweetening agent. While not realizing the chemical components, Roman winemakers were able to identify the benefits of added sense of [[body (wine)|body]] or [[mouthfeel]].&lt;ref name="Sogg"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sogg, D | url=http://www.winespectator.com/Wine/Archives/Show_Article/0,1275,3567,00.html | title=Inside Wine: Chaptalization | journal=Wine Spectator | date=2002-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the process has long been associated with French wine, the first recorded mention of adding sugar to must in French literature was the 1765 edition of ''[[L'Encyclopedie]]'', which advocated the use of sugar for sweetening wine over the previously accepted practice of using [[lead diacetate|lead acetate]]. In 1777, the French chemist [[Pierre Macquer]] discovered that the actual chemical benefit of adding sugar to must was an increase in alcohol to balance the high acidity of [[underripe grapes]] rather than any perceived increase in sweetness. In 1801, while in the services of [[Napoleon]], Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal began advocating the technique as a means of strengthening and preserving wine.&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 195-196"&gt;{{cite book | author=Phillips, R | title=A Short History of Wine | pages=195–196 | publisher=Harper Collins | year=2000 | isbn=0-06-621282-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, the [[German wine]] industry was hard hit by severe weather that created considerable difficulty for harvesting ripened grapes in this cool region. A chemist named [[Ludwig Gall]] suggested Chaptal's method of adding sugar to the must to help wine makers compensate for the effects of detrimental weather. This process of ''Verbesserung'' (improvement) helped sustain wine production in the [[Mosel (wine region)|Mosel]] region during this difficult period.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 395"&gt;{{cite book | author=Johnson, H | title=Vintage: The Story of Wine | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year=1989 | isbn=0-671-68702-6 | page=395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the turn of the twentieth century, the process became controversial in the French wine industry with [[Winemaking|vigneron]]s in the [[Languedoc]] protesting the production of "artificial wines" that flooded the French wine market and drove down prices. In June 1907, huge demonstrations broke out across the Languedoc with over 900,000 protesters demanding that the government take action to protect their livelihood. Riots in the city of [[Narbonne]] prompted Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] to send the [[French army]] to the city. The ensuing clash resulted in the death of five protesters. The following day, Languedoc sympathizers burned the [[prefecture]] in [[Perpignan]]. In response to the protests, the French government increased the taxation on sugar and passed laws limiting the amount of sugar that can be added to wine.&lt;ref name="Phillips pg 291"&gt;Phillips, 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process variations==
[[Image:Saccharose.svg|thumb|right|During fermentation, components of the sucrose molecules are converted into ethanol.]]
Different techniques are employed to adjust the level of sugar in the grape must. In the normal chaptalization process, [[cane sugar]] is the most common type of sugar added, although some winemakers prefer [[beet sugar]] or [[corn syrup]]. In many wine regions, [[brown sugar]] is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape [[concentrate]] may be added.&lt;ref name="Sogg"/&gt; After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the [[sucrose]] molecules in sugar into [[glucose]] and [[fructose]], which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and [[carbon dioxide]].

In warmer regions, where overripening is a concern, the opposite process of rehydration (dilution with water) and acidification is used. This is used in jurisdictions such as areas of California, where if the must has excess sugar for normal fermentation, water may be added to lower the concentration. In acidification, [[tartaric acid]] is added to the must to compensate for the high levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/media/Oakland-Magazine/September-October-2006/Wine-Spirits-Hang-Time/|title=Hang Time|publisher=Oakland Magazine|date=September–October 2006|author=Daniel, Laurie|accessdate=2007-04-05|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928194317/http://www.oaklandmagazine.com/media/Oakland-Magazine/September-October-2006/Wine-Spirits-Hang-Time/#|archive-date=2007-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of sugar and low levels of acid naturally found in ripe grapes.&lt;ref name="Robinson pg 81"&gt;{{cite book | author=Robinson, J | title=Jancis Robinson's Wine Course | publisher=Abbeville Press | year=2003 | isbn=0-7892-0883-0 | page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Champagne production]], measured quantities of sugar, wine, and sometimes [[Brandy]] are added after fermentation and prior to corking in a process known as dosage. Chaptalization, on the other hand, involves adding sugar ''prior'' to fermentation. [[List of champagne producers|Champagne producers]] sometimes employ chaptalization in their winemaking when the wine is still in the form of must.&lt;ref name="Sogg"/&gt;

Some wine journalists contend that chaptalization allows wine makers to sacrifice quality in favor of quantity by letting vines overproduce high yields of grapes that have not fully ripened.&lt;ref name="MacNeil pg 278"/&gt; Also, winemakers have been using technological advances, such as [[reverse osmosis]] to remove water from the unfermented grape juice, thereby increasing its sugar concentration,&lt;ref name="Sogg"/&gt; but decreasing the volume of wine produced.

==Current legality==
[[Image:Toasting Champagne.jpg|right|thumb|Chaptalization is standard in the production of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]].]]
Control of chaptalization is fairly strict in many countries, and generally only permitted in more northerly areas where grapes might not ripen enough. In the [[European Union]], the amount of chaptalization allowed depends on the [[European Union wine growing zones|wine growing zone]].

In some areas, such as Germany, wine regulations dictate that the wine makers must [[wine label|label]] whether or not the wines are "natural," i.e. without sugar. Other areas, such as France, do not have such label requirements.&lt;ref name="Johnson pg 395"/&gt;

[[File:Concept-design-2.jpg|thumb|Example of concept design workflow (blue) followed by 3D modeling (red), reference and inspiration for 3D modeling is a common use of concept art]]
'''Concept art''' is a form of [[illustration]] used to convey an idea for use in [[films]], [[video game]]s, [[animation]], [[comic books]], or other media before it is put into the final product. Concept art usually refers to world-building artwork used to inspire the development of media products, and is not the same as visual development art or concept design, though all three are often confused. 

Concept art is developed through several iterations. Multiple solutions are explored before settling on the final design. Concept art is not only used to develop the work, but also to show the project's progress to directors, clients and investors. Once the development of the work is complete, concept art may be reworked and used for advertising materials.

== History ==
The term "concept art" was used by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] as early as the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tengrenn|first1=Gustaf|title=1930 / 1940 Disney Concept Art by par Gustaf Tenggren|url=http://www.ufunk.net/en/artistes/gustaf-tenggren-disney-concept-art/|website=Ufunk|publisher=Fabien Bouchard|accessdate=25 September 2014|archivedate=2015-03-15|pages=www.gustaftenggren.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315132156/http://www.ufunk.net/en/artistes/gustaf-tenggren-disney-concept-art/|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A concept artist is an individual who generates a visual design for an item, character, or area that does not yet exist. This includes, but is not limited to, film, animation, and more recently, video game production. Being a concept artist takes commitment, vision and a clear understanding of the role.&lt;ref name="cgspectrum_concept-artist"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nice |first1=Kevin |title=What it's like to be a Concept Artist: An Interview with Jake Collinge |url=https://www.cgspectrum.edu.au/blog/what-it-is-like-to-be-a-professional-concept-artist/ |website=www.cgspectrum.edu.au |publisher=College of Digital Art and Animation |accessdate=November 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept artist may be required for nothing more than preliminary artwork, or be part of a creative team until a project reaches fruition.
While it is necessary to have the skills of a fine artist, a concept artist must also be able to work to strict deadlines in the capacity of a [[graphic designer]]. Some concept artists may start as fine artists, industrial designers, animators, or even special effects artists. Interpretation of ideas and how they are realized is where the concept artist's individual creativity is most evident, but subject matter is often beyond their control. Many concept artists work in a studio or from home via freelance. Working for a studio has the advantaged of an established salary. The average salary for a concept artist in video games is 60-$70,000 a year, although many make much less or more than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Severson |first= Dana |title= Starting Salary for a Concept Artist for Video Games |url=http://work.chron.com/starting-salary-concept-artist-video-games-24949.html |work= [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]
|access-date=October 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==
Concept art has embraced the use of digital [[technology]]. [[Raster graphics editor]]s for [[digital painting]] have become more easily available, as well as hardware such as [[graphics tablet]]s, enabling more efficient working methods. Prior to this, any number of traditional mediums such as [[oil paint]]s, [[acrylic paint]]s, [[Marker pen|markers]] and [[pencils]] were used. Many modern paint packages are programmed to simulate the blending of color in the same way paint would blend on a canvas; proficiency with traditional media is often paramount to a concept artist's ability to use painting software. Popular programs for concept artists include Photoshop and Corel Painter. Others include Manga Studio, Procreate and Art Rage. Most concept artists have switched to digital media because of ease of editing and speed. A lot of concept work has tight deadlines where a highly polished piece is needed in a short amount of time.

==Themes==
Concept art has always had to cover many subjects, being the primary medium in [[film poster]] design since the early days of [[Hollywood]], but the two most widely covered areas are [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy art|fantasy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. Since the recent rise of its use in video game production, concept art has expanded to cover genres from [[soccer|football]] to the [[mafia]] and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shamsuddin|first1=Kalam|title=Evaluating Content Based Animation through Concept Art|journal=International Journal of Trends in Computer Science|date=2013|volume=2|issue=11|url=https://www.academia.edu/5239068/Evaluating_Content_Based_Animation_through_Concept_Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Styles==
Concept art ranges from [[stylized]] to [[photorealistic]] depending on the needs of the IP. Artists working on a project often produce a large turnover in the early 'blue sky' stage of production. This provides a broad range of interpretations, most being in the form of [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]], [[Speed painting|speed paints]], and 3D overpaints. Later pieces, such as [[matte painting]]s, are produced as realistically as required. Concept artists will often have to adapt to the style of the studio they are hired for. The ability to produce multiple styles is valued in a concept artist.

==Specialization==
There are many concept art generalists, but there are also many specialized concept artists. The various specializations include, but are not limited to, drafting of characters, as well as creatures, as well as environments, or even industry-related designs. Specialization is regarded as better for freelancers than concept artists who want to work in-house, where flexibility is key. Knowing the foundations of art, such as anatomy, perspective, color theory, design, and lighting are essential to all specializations.

'''Conductive characteristics in coated synthetic fabrics''' demonstrates an energy current across a specific woven synthetic material, such energy generation in fabrics coated with a conductive polymer as found in [[polypyrrole]].&lt;ref&gt;Polypyrrole&lt;/ref&gt; First validated by D.D.S. developer M.H.Webb, the discovery showed that when [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]&lt;ref&gt;PET&lt;/ref&gt; fabrics are coated by [[chemical synthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Synthesis&lt;/ref&gt; using four different [[oxidizing]] agent–[[dopant]] combinations present an increase in energy when a fixed source is applied to the fabric. Several combinations of blends have proven to be successful in transfer, [[anthracenedione]]-2-[[sulfonic acid]] (AQSA) [[sodium salt]] doped polypyrrole coating was the most effective in generation whereas the [[sodium perchlorate]] dopant system was the least effective. The power density per unit area achieved in polypyrrole coated polyester–Lycra fabric with 0.027&amp;nbsp;mol/l of AQSA acting as dopant was 430 W/m2. The power density per unit area achieved for the sodium perchlorate system, using the same synthesis conditions, was 55 W/m2.

In [[electronics]], a '''driver''' is an [[electrical circuit]] or other [[electronic component]] used to control another circuit or component, such as a high-power [[transistor]], [[liquid crystal display]] (LCD), and numerous others.

They are usually used to regulate current flowing through a circuit or to control other factors such as other components, some devices in the circuit. The term is often used, for example, for a specialized [[integrated circuit]] that controls high-power [[switches]] in switched-mode [[power converter]]s. An [[amplifier]] can also be considered a driver for [[loudspeaker]]s, or a [[voltage regulator]] that keeps an attached component operating within a broad range of input [[voltage]]s.

Typically the driver stage(s) of a circuit requires different characteristics to other circuit stages. For example in a transistor power amplifier circuit, typically the driver circuit requires current gain, often the ability to discharge the following transistor bases rapidly, and low output impedance to avoid or minimize distortion.

'''Kathleen Elizabeth Tanner''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|FREng|FRSE}} (born 20 March 1957) is a professor of biomedical materials at the [[University of Glasgow]]. Her research focusses on developing materials with particular biological and mechanical properties for use medicine, particularly those used for bone replacement. Tanner developed HAPEX&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;, a bone mineral composite [[biomaterial]], which was used in over half a million middle ear transplants in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.raeng.org.uk/policy/diversity-in-engineering/diversity-and-inclusion-at-the-academy/celebrating-leading-women-in-engineering/liz-tanner|title=Professor Liz Tanner OBE|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Royal Academy of Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Enhanced flight vision system''' ('''EFVS''', sometimes '''EVS''') is an [[Avionics|airborne system]] which provides an image of the scene and displays it to the pilot, in order to provide an image in which the scene and objects in it can be better detected. In other words, an EFVS is a system which provides the pilot with an image which is better than unaided human vision. An EFVS includes imaging sensors (one or many) such as a color camera, [[infrared camera]] or [[radar]], and typically a display for the pilot, which can be a [[head-mounted display]] or [[head-up display]]. An EFVS may be combined with a [[synthetic vision system]] to create a combined vision system.&lt;ref name=DO341&gt;RTCA DO-341, Sep. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An EFVS can be mounted on military or civilian aircraft, fixed wing (airplane) or rotary wing (helicopter). 
The image must be displayed to the pilot conformal to the scene, i.e. the pilot must see the artificially displayed elements in exact positions relative to the real world.
Usually along with the enhanced image, the system will display [[visual cues]] such as a horizon bar and runway location.

== Enhanced vision ==
[[File:Enhanced vision system on Global 6000.jpg|thumb|EVS Camera under a [[Global 6000]] windshield]]

Enhanced vision is a related to [[Synthetic vision system]] which incorporates information from aircraft based sensors (e.g., near-infrared cameras, millimeter wave radar) to provide vision in limited visibility environments.

Night vision systems have been available to pilots of military aircraft for many years. More recently business jets have added similar capabilities to aircraft to enhance pilot situational awareness in poor visibility due to weather or haze, and at night.  The first civil certification of an enhanced vision system on an aircraft was pioneered by [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] using a Kollsman IR camera. Originally offered as an option on the Gulfstream V aircraft, it was made standard equipment in 2003 when the [[Gulfstream G550]] was introduced and followed on the [[Gulfstream G450]] and [[Gulfstream G650]]. As of 2009, Gulfstream has delivered over 500 aircraft with a certified EVS installed. Other aircraft OEMs followed, with EVS now available on some Bombardier and Dassault business jet products. Boeing has begun offering EVS on its line of Boeing business jets and is likely to include it as an option on the B787 and B737 MAX.

The Gulfstream EVS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gulfstream.com/product_enhancements/evs/ |publisher= Gulfstream |title= Enhanced Vision System}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later EVS II systems use an IR camera mounted in the aircraft's nose to project a raster image on the [[head-up display]] (HUD). The IR image on the HUD is conformal to the outside scene, meaning that objects detected by the IR camera are the same size and aligned with objects outside the aircraft. Thus in poor visibility the pilot is able to view the IR camera image and is able to seamlessly and easily transition to the outside world as the aircraft gets closer.

The advantage of EVS is that safety in nearly all phases of flight are enhanced, especially during approach and landing in limited visibility. A pilot on a stabilized approach is able to recognize the runway environment (lights, runway markings, etc.) earlier in preparation for touchdown. Obstacles such as terrain, structures, and vehicles or other aircraft on the runway that might not otherwise be seen are clearly visible on the IR image.

The FAA grants some additional operating minimums to aircraft equipped with certified enhanced vision systems allowing Category I approaches to Category II minimums. Typically an operator is permitted to descend to lower altitudes closer to the runway surface (typically as low as 100&amp;nbsp;ft) in poor visibility in order to improve the chances of spotting the runway environment prior to landing. Aircraft not equipped with such systems would not be allowed to descend as low and often would be required to execute a missed approach and fly to a suitable alternate airport.

Other sensor types have been flown for research purposes, including active and passive millimeter wave radar. In 2009, DARPA provided funding to develop "Sandblaster", a millimeter wave radar based enhanced vision system installed on helicopters which enables the pilot to see and avoid obstacles in the landing area that may be obscured by smoke, sand, or dust.

The combination of dissimilar sensor types such as long wave IR, short wave IR, and millimeter wave radar can help ensure that real time video imagery of the outside scene can be provided to the pilot in all types of visibility conditions. For example, long wave IR sensor performance can be degraded in some types of large water droplet precipitation where millimeter wave radar would be less affected.

==History==
[[File:F-15E LANTIRN IR HUD image.jpg|thumb|[[thermal image]] viewed through a [[head-up display]]]]

[[Night vision device]]s for military personnel have been operational since the time of [[World War II]]. Their use has been adopted also by military pilots, mainly in [[rotary-wing aircraft]] (helicopters). The use of such devices has been suggested for use by commercial pilots since the 1970s, but it was not until 1999 that the first commercial, [[FAA]] certified system, was airborne.
Still, the pilot could not use the system to lower an aircraft below the required natural vision limit.

[[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]] in 2001 became the first civilian aircraft manufacturer to develop and earn certification on its aircraft for EVS produced by [[Elbit Systems|Elbit]]'s [[Kollsman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://propilotmag.com/archives/2017/Feb%2017/A1_evs_p1.html Let's look at FAA's final rule on EFVS use published Dec 13, 2016] Professional Pilot website,&lt;/ref&gt; The FAA permitted the use of the EVS to descend down to 100 feet above Touch-down zone, if no other restrictions apply.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/06/18/01-15333/special-conditions-enhanced-vision-system-evs-for-gulfstream-model-g-v-airplanes Special Conditions: Enhanced Vision System (EVS) for Gulfstream Model G-V Airplanes], FAA (June 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; It was not clear at the time whether an EFVS could be used for descending below that height. The situation was amended in 2004 with corrections to FAA FAR 91.175.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgFAR.nsf/0/66AFE97435E47B3A86256E1A00518D27?OpenDocument General Operating and Flught Rules – Instrument Flight Rules Sec. 91.175.]&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the first time an EFVS gave a concrete commercial advantage over unaided vision.

===Generation I EFVS===
The first EVS's comprised a cooled mid-wave (MWIR) [[Forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) camera, and a HUD, certified for flight with the Gulfstream V aircraft. The camera has a cooled MWIR sensor

===Airport LED transition and multispectral EFVS===
EVSs are traditionally based on a [[Forward looking infrared]] camera which gives a thermal image of the world, and shows up heat released from airport [[Approach lighting system|approach lights]]. Most airports use incandescent [[Parabolic aluminized reflector light]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/lsg/malsr/ Lighting Systems - Medium Approach Light System with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (MALSR)], FAA (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; though energy efficiency standards (such as the ''[[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]]'') have caused some airports to switch to [[LED]] lighting, which has a lower thermal signature.

However, since 2007, airports are switching to the more energy efficient [[LED]] lighting, which has a lower thermal profile. The new EVS designs are [[multispectral imaging|multispectral]], to capture both visual light from LED lights and the thermal image of previous EVS generations. Future EVS designs focus on all-weather vision, which can be accomplished by intelligently fusing images and data from cameras operating in visible light, infrared, and [[millimeter-wave]].

== Aircraft ==
An EFVS can be mounted on any type of craft. The typical platform is a small passenger plane, since it is more cost-effective to use an EFVS than an instrumental landing system, which is used in larger passenger airplanes.

[[NASA]] is developing a new supersonic airplane, the [[Lockheed Martin X-59 QueSST|X-59 QueSST]], to study technology related to better supersonic passenger planes. A key feature is an opaque nosecone, which the pilot cannot see through. NASA is considering using an EFVS to enable pilot vision on this plane. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/23103/nasas-x-59a-quiet-supersonic-test-jet-will-have-zero-forward-visibility-for-its-pilot&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
=== Sensors ===
The sensor unit of the EFVS can include a single imaging sensor, multiple cameras and also additional navigation-aiding sensors.

====FLIR====
Traditionally, the EVS sensor was a single [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) camera. FLIRs are of two major types: one is the high-end, cooled, [[MWIR|MWIR band]] (3-5&amp;nbsp;um) camera, which has better temperature resolution and frame rate but is more expensive and bulky, and the other is uncooled microbolometers which operate in the [[LWIR|LWIR band]] (8-14&amp;nbsp;um) of the light spectrum, are small and cheap but are less "sharp" with regards to temperature contrast.

The EVS sensor in a single FLIR EVS is usually the high-end cooled sensor. In multi-spectral applications the preferred sensor is usually uncooled since it has better atmospheric penetration in most cases (will see farther), while the fine image details will be provided by a complementary sensor.

==== VIS and NIR ====
Natural unaided vision in the [[visible light|visible]] portion of the light spectrum, along with the [[near-infrared]], can be improved by using high end cameras. Such a camera can be a high dynamic range camera for day vision, a low-light [[CMOS camera]] (sometimes called scientific CMOS or sCMOS) and [[night vision goggles]].

In day vision and bright light it may seem that there is no need to improve the natural vision, but there are certain cases in which it may be necessary. For example, in a strong haze situation where the whole scene is very bright and features are not distinguishable, a high dynamic range camera can filter the background and present a high-contrast image, and detect the runway approach lights further away than natural vision.

==== SWIR ====
A SWIR (short-wavelength [[infrared]]) camera is a relatively new technology. It can offer advantages for an EFVS, such as: better haze penetration than VIS, natural scene contrast similar to VIS unlike a MWIR or LWIR. SWIR cameras aree available commercially, but there is no reported use of a SWIR camera in a commercial EFVS.

==== Millimeter wave camera ====
A passive millimeter wave (PMMW) camera, typically between 70-250 GHZ (1-4&amp;nbsp;mm) wave band, is a promising technology for EFVS applications. It has been proposed by NASA in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19950006802 Passive MMW camera for low visibility landings], Airborne Windshear Detection and Warning Systems. Fifth and Final Combined Manufacturers' and Technologists' Conference, Part 2; p 765-785 (July 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been flying prototypes, but it is not yet commercially available.

A PMMW camera is a thermal camera similar in principle to a FLIR: the [[black-body radiation]] from objects, which depends on their temperature and surface properties (such as [[emissivity]]), is captured through a lens and focused on the sensor, and then converted to an electrical signal. The difference from FLIR is the scales involved. The energy at millimetric wavelengths is much smaller than energy at 8-14 microns, the technology to capture the photons is different, and the physical size of the camera is much larger.

==== Imaging radar ====
An imaging radar has also been proposed by NASA in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19940021001 The 94 GHz MMW imaging radar system], Proceedings of the Workshop on Augmented Visual Display (AVID) Research; p 47-60 (December 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; It can offer the same scene resolution as a PMMW, but has different properties. It does not rely on natural radiation bu emits radio waves, which are reflected from the target and captured in the receiver. The image will be nearly the same under all conditions since it does not depend on the object temperature. An imaging radar requires very high resources for computation, since the image is formed by digital calculation and not by a lens. There have been flying prototypes, but it is not yet commercially available.

==== Lidar ====
A [[lidar]] is a laser system which scans the surrounding volume and provides 3D location of objects. From the data can be produced a synthetic image and also other critical flight data. The operational distance of a lidar depends on the output power. It is typically under 1&amp;nbsp;km distance, but is not limited in principle. Due to the relatively short distance it is considered more for helicopters than for airplanes. It can also aid in penetrating light to moderate atmospheric low-visibility conditions, such as fog and dust. Lidar is used in automotive applications (cars), and is being tested for helicopter landing applications.

==== Navigational sensors ====
A navigational sensor may aid in complementing the image. A synthetic image can be produced based on scene data in memory and location of the aircraft, and displayed top the pilot. In principle, a pilot could land based on this synthetic image, subject to its precision and fidelity.

* The most common navigation aid is a '''[[GPS]]'''. An enhanced GPS can provide the 3D location of the aircraft with accuracy of a 10&amp;nbsp;cm (4"). There are integrity issues that prevent it from being a full navigation solution. It can be blocked or tricked into reporting a false position, or lose the position, and not be able to report the problem in the first few seconds. These drawbacks prevent the GPS to be used as a stand-alone sensor in critical flilght phases such as landing.
* '''[[Image registration]]''' is the comparison of the image acquired from an imaging sensor to a recorded image (usually from satellite) which has a known global position. The comparison allows to place the image, and therefore the camera (and with it the aircraft) in a precise global position and orientation, up to a precision which depends on the image resolution.
* An '''[[inertial navigation system]]''' (INS) or inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device which measures [[acceleration]], [[angular velocity]], and sometimes the [[magnetic field]], using a combination of [[accelerometer]]s and [[gyroscope]]s, sometimes also [[magnetometers]]. The INS uses the information to determine position and orientation over time, by [[dead reckoning]], i.e. only relative to a previously known position. Combined with a GPS or image registration, it can provide an accurate absolute position.
* A '''[[radar altimeter]]''' can provide the aircraft elevation above the terrain with high precision and fidelity. Altitude is information which can be combined with other data to provide a precise location.

=== Display ===
[[File:LANTIRN.JPG|thumb|Not displayed, [[head-up display|HUD]], [[head-mounted display]]]]

The display to the pilot is a [[see-through display]], which means it allows both seeing the scene directly with unaided vision and seeing a projected image.
The display is one of two types: 
# [[Head-mounted display]] or helmet-mounted display. It includes [[glasses]]-like surfaces in front of the pilot's eyes and mounted on the head, and a projection system which projects an image on the glasses to be reflected or [[Lens (optics)|refracted]] to the pilot's eyes. Augmented-reality goggles are a notable example of such a display. Since it is moving with the pilot's head it must include tracking sensors to project the correct image according to the direction it is facing.
# [[Head-up display]] is a system composed of a large reflecting plate (called combiner) positioned in front of the pilot, and a projection system. The system generates an image which is reflected from the combiner to the pilot.
A [[head-down display]] is an LCD screen installed below the window, hence the name "head-down". It is generally not used as an EFVS display, since the external scene cannot be seen when looking at it.

In addition to the improved sensors image, the image displayed to the pilot will include [[symbology (avionics)|symbology]], which is a collection of visual cues displayed to a pilot regarding altitude, azimuth, horizon orientation, flight path, fuel state, other aircraft etc., and in military avionics additional friend/foe symbols, targeting system cues, weapon sights etc.

The displayed EFVS imagery and symbology must be presented so that they are aligned with and scaled to the external view. The process of alignment is called ''harmonization''. A head-up display must be harmonized with the imaging sensors. A head-mounted display moves constantly with the pilot's head, and must therefore be tracked continuously so that the image displayed conforms to the scene in real-time, see [[Helmet-mounted display]]. There is an additional issue of lag time between the image and head motion, which must be very small so as not to cause dizzyness.

The main purpose of an EVS is to permit [[takeoff]], [[landing]] and [[taxiing]] in poor visibility conditions, 
where landing would not be safe otherwise. An EVS is certified for landing by the [[FAA]] only if it is combined with a [[head-up display|HUD]], in which case it is called an EFVS.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA]] [http://www.rtca.org/store_product.asp?prodid=1085 DO-315B] (2012), "Minimum Aviation System Performance Standards (MASPS) for Enhanced Vision Systems, Synthetic Vision Systems, Combined Vision Systems and Enhanced Flight Vision Systems"&lt;/ref&gt;

The criterion for landing is known as [[decision height]]. [[ICAO]] defines Decision Height as "a specified altitude or height in the precision approach at which a missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established." 
When a pilot in approaching the ground, they must see a visual reference to continue the approach. The visual references must be one of the following (see ''[[runway]]''):
# The [[approach lighting system]] (if exists).
# both the runway threshold and the touchdown zone, which are identifiable by their markings or lights.
If the pilot cannot see such a reference in the decision height, they must abort the landing, and then circle for a second approach or land elsewhere.

Above the decision height, the pilot uses mostly the aircraft displays. Below decision height, the pilot must look outside to identify visual references. In this stage the pilot alternates between looking at displays and looking out the window. This switching can be avoided if a see-through display is installed to display information to the pilot while also looking out.

===Combined with synthetic vision===

[[Head-up display|HUD]]s then EVS came to business jets in 2001 and the FAA published EVFS rules in 2016 to land in poor visibility through a HUD, precluding [[Primary flight display|PFD]] use, with combined enhanced and [[synthetic vision]] system (CVS).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AIN20jul2018&gt;--&gt;
Under current [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR]] 91.175 regulations, airplanes with HUDs can attain {{cvt|100|ft}} before switching to natural vision to land, permitting all-weather landing in airports without [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] Cat II/III approaches.&lt;ref name=AIN20jul2018/&gt;
After beginning work in 2011, Dassault was first to certify its CVS with its [[Elbit]] HUD and camera, ''FalconEye'', in October 2016 in the [[Falcon 2000]] and [[Falcon 900|900]], then in the [[Falcon 8X|8X]] in early 2017.&lt;ref name=AIN20jul2018/&gt;

In July 2018, FAA certification of the [[Gulfstream G500]] allowed the EFVS to provide the only visual cues for [[landing]] down to {{cvt|1,000|feet}} [[runway visual range]], to touchdown and rollout, after 50 test approaches, and testing to lower visibilities could allow dropping the limit, with approvals for previous Gulfstreams to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2018-11-13/gulfstream-first-certify-efvs-landing-system |title= Gulfstream First to Certify EFVS Landing System |author= Matt Thurber |date= November 13, 2018 |work= AIN online }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By October 2018, the Falcon 8X FalconEye was approved by the [[FAA]] and [[EASA]] for approaches down to {{cvt|100|feet}}, before the Falcon 2000LX and 900LX by year-end.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AIN9oct2018&gt;--&gt;
A dual HUD FalconEye will allow EVS-to-land in 2020, without using natural vision.&lt;ref name=AIN9oct2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2018-10-09/faa-easa-ok-dassault-8x-efvs-down-100-feet |title= FAA, EASA OK Dassault 8X EFVS Down to 100 Feet |author= Matt Thurber |date= October 9, 2018 |work= AIN online }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Rockwell Collins's conformal overlay of EVS and SVS is expected to enter service with the updated Global 5500/6500 around 2020.&lt;ref name=AIN20jul2018&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2018-07-20/flying-dassaults-falconeye-combined-vision-system |title= Flying Dassault's FalconEye Combined Vision System |author= Matt Thurber |date= July 20, 2018 |work= AIN online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bombardier Global]]s use a [[Rockwell Collins]] HUD and camera while [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]]s have a cooled Kollsman (Elbit) camera and a Rockwell Collins HUD.&lt;ref name=AIN20jul2018/&gt;
Early [[cryocooler|cryogenically cooled]], [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) cameras could detect 1.0-5.0-micron [[Mid-infrared|mid-IR]] for hot incandescent [[runway light]]s and some background radiation from its surface, blind to [[visible wavelength]]s for [[LED]] airport lights or [[Long-wave infrared|long-wave IR]] for finer environment details: the Elbit FalconEye sees in the 0.4-1.1-micron visible light and [[Near-infrared|near-IR]] band and the 8.0-12.5-micron long-wave-IR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/dassault-falconeye-head-leap-forward-situational-awareness |title= Dassault FalconEye: A Head-Up Leap Forward In Situational Awareness |date= Aug 23, 2018 |author= Fred George |work= Business &amp; Commercial Aviation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives to EVS-assisted landing===

====Instrument landing system====
An [[Instrument landing system]], or ILS, relies on radio signals to allow operation in any weather. For an ILS landing to be allowed, the system must be installed on the ground, and a suitably equipped aircraft and appropriately qualified crew are required. Not all airports and runways are suitable for ILS installation, because of terrain conditions (hills in the way of the signal, non-straight landing slope).

====GPS-assisted landing====
While the GPS has a very high inherent precision, the reliability is not high enough for landing. GPS signals may be intentionally jammed, or lose integrity. In such cases, it may take the GPS receiver a few seconds to detect the malfunction, which is too long for critical flight stages. GPS can be used to lower the decision height below the unaided threshold, down to cat I decision height minima, but not lower.

A '''green highway''' is a roadway constructed per a relatively new concept for roadway design that integrates [[transportation]] functionality and [[ecological sustainability]]. An environmental approach is used throughout the planning, design, and the construction. The result is a highway that will benefit transportation, the [[ecosystem]], urban growth, public health and surrounding communities.

==Research==
[[Green Highways Partnership]] (GHP) is an alliance of  Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), other Federal agencies, State transportation and environmental agencies, industry, trade associations, members of academia, and contractors to encourage environmentally friendly road building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfhrc.gov/focus/apr08/01.htm|title=Federal Highway Administration Research and Technology-- - Federal Highway Administration|website=www.tfhrc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effort to create greener highways is a research program named Asphalt Research Consortium(ACR) created by collaboration of FHWA, private institutions, and several universities. The program studies potential ways to make asphalt more environmentally sustainable which will result in improved traffic safety and reduced life-cycle cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arc.unr.edu/|title=Asphalt Research Consortium|website=www.arc.unr.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
When built to standards of the concept, green highways have invaluable benefits to environment. Since they are  built with permeable materials that provide superior [[drainage basin|watershed]]-driven [[stormwater]] management, leaching of [[metal]]s and [[toxin]]s into [[stream]]s and [[river]]s is prevented. [[Landfill]] usage is favorably reduced as construction involves [[recycling|recycled]] materials. In addition, by using cutting-edge technologies in design,  critical [[habitat]]s and ecosystems are protected from the encroachment of highway  [[infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhighways.org/faq.cfm|title=ダイレクトメールの開封率を上げる方法 - ダイレクトメール情報集|website=ダイレクトメール情報集}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
To develop a green highway, a project can follow guidelines provided below by GHP:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhighways.org/Makes_Highway_Green.cfm|title=ダイレクトメールの開封率を上げる方法 - ダイレクトメール情報集|website=ダイレクトメール情報集}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Provide a net increase in environmental functions and values of a [[drainage basin|watershed]].
* Go beyond minimum standards set by environmental laws and regulations.
* Identify and protect historic and cultural landmarks.
* Map all [[Natural resource|resources]] in the area in order to avoid, identify, and protect critical resource areas.
* Use innovative, natural methods to reduce imperviousness, and cleanse all [[Surface runoff|runoff]] within the project area.
* Maximize use of existing transportation infrastructure, providing multi-modal transportation opportunities, and promoting [[ride-sharing]]/[[public transportation]].
* Use recycled materials to eliminate [[waste]] and reduce the [[energy]] required to build the highway.
* Link regional transportation plans with local land use partnerships.
* Control populations of [[invasive species]], and promoting the growth of [[native species]].
* Incorporate post project monitoring to ensure environmental results.
* Protect the [[hydrology]] of [[wetlands]] and streams channels through restoration of natural [[drainage]] paths.
* Result in a suite of targeted environmental outcomes based upon local environmental needs.
* Reduce disruptions to ecological processes by promoting [[wildlife corridor]]s and passages in areas identified through [[wildlife conservation]] plans.
* Encourage smart growth by integrating and guiding future growth and capacity building with ecological constraints.

==Technology==
Green highway construction can incorporate several technical elements including, but not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhighways.org/practices.cfm|title=ダイレクトメールの開封率を上げる方法 - ダイレクトメール情報集|website=ダイレクトメール情報集}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/ '''High-performance Integrated Virtual Environment'''] (HIVE) is a [[distributed computing environment]] used for biological research, including analysis of [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|Next Generation Sequencing]] (NGS) data, post market data, adverse events, metagenomic data, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simonyan |first1=Vahan |last2=Mazumder |first2=Raja |title=High-Performance Integrated Virtual Environment (HIVE) Tools and Applications for Big Data Analysis |journal=Genes |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=957–81 |year=2014 |pmid=25271953 |pmc=4276921 |doi=10.3390/genes5040957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
HIVE is a massively parallel [[distributed computing environment]] where the distributed storage library and the distributed computational powerhouse are linked seamlessly.&lt;ref&gt;https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/help/HIVEWhitePaper_12_16_2014.pdf{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system is both robust and flexible due to maintaining both storage and the [[metadata]] database on the same network.&lt;ref&gt;https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/help/HIVEInfrastructuresUK.pdf{{full citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distributed storage layer of software is the key component for file and archive management and is the backbone for the deposition pipeline. The data deposition back-end allows automatic uploads and downloads of external datasets into HIVE data repositories. The metadata database can be used to maintain specific information about extremely large files ingested into the system (big data) as well as metadata related to computations run on the system.  This metadata then allows details of a computational pipeline to be brought up easily in the future in order to validate or replicate experiments.  Since the metadata is associated with the computation, it stores the parameters of any computation in the system eliminating manual record keeping.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Differentiating HIVE from other object oriented databases is that HIVE implements a set of unified [[Application programming interface|APIs]] to search, view, and manipulate data of all types. The system also facilitates a highly secure hierarchical access control and permission system, allowing determination of data access privileges in a finely granular manner without creating a multiplicity of rules in the security subsystem. The security model, designed for sensitive data, provides comprehensive control and auditing functionality in compliance with HIVE's designation as a [[Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002|FISMA]] Moderate system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=C. A. |last2=Simonyan |first2=V. |title=FDA's Activities Supporting Regulatory Application of 'Next Gen' Sequencing Technologies |journal=PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology |volume=68 |issue=6 |pages=626–30 |year=2014 |pmid=25475637 |doi=10.5731/pdajpst.2014.01024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HIVE technological capabilities==
*'''Data-retrieval''': the HIVE is capable of retrieving data from a variety of sources such as local, cloud-based or network storage, sequencing instruments, and from http, ftp and sftp repositories. Additionally, HIVE implements the sophisticated handshake protocols with existing large scale data platforms such as NIH/NCBI to download large amounts of reference genomic or sequence read data on behalf of users in an easy and accurate manner.
*'''Data-warehousing''': HIVE honeycomb data model was specifically created for adopting complex hierarchy of scientific datatypes, providing a platform for standardization and provenance of data within the framework of object-oriented data models. By using an integrated data-engine, honeycomb, HIVE contributes to the veracity of biomedical computations and helps ensure reproducibility, and harmonization of bio-computational processes.
*'''Security''': HIVE-honeycomb employs a hierarchical security control system, allowing the determination of access privileges in an acutely granular manner without overwhelming the security subsystem with a multiplicity of rules. It provides on the fly encryption/decryption of PII and is compliant with the highest security protocols as requested for systems authorized to operate in regulatory FISMA moderate environments.

[[File:HIVE-visualizations.png|300px|right|HIVE-visualizations]]

*'''Integration''': HIVE provides unified Application Program Interface (API) to search, edit, view, secure, share and manipulate data and computations of all types.  As an Integrator platform HIVE provides developers means to develop (C/C++, Python, Perl, JavaScript, R) and integrate existing almost any open source or commercial tools using generic adaptation framework to integrate command line tools. Additionally session controlled web-API provides means to drive HIVE to perform data quality control and complex computations on behalf of remote users. Currently there are tens of big data analytics tools  in production HIVE and dozens more being developed; these include but are not limited to DNA-, RNA-, Transposon-, Chip-, Immune-sequencing), de novo assembly, population genomics metagenomic sequencing, differential profiling, statistical, classification and clusterization utilities to study bacteria, viruses, human germline and somatic profiles, quasispecies, infections, pathogens.
*'''Computations''': Unlike many virtual computing environments, HIVE virtualizes services, not processes: it provides computations as a service by introducing agnostic abstraction layer between hardware, software and the computational tasks requested by users. The novel paradigm of relocating computations closer to the data, instead of moving data to computing cores has proven to be the key for optimal flow of tasks and data through network infrastructure.
*'''Visualization''': HIVE provides number of scientific visualization components using technologies as HTML5, SVG, D3JS within its Data Driven Document context. The native data and metadata and computational results provided in JSON, CSV-based communication protocols, which are used to generate interactive, user driven, customizable tools allow bioinformaticians to manipulate terabytes of extra-large data using only an Internet browser.

==HIVE open source==
FDA launched HIVE Open Source as a platform to support end to end needs for NGS analytics. 
https://github.com/FDA/fda-hive

'''HIVE biocompute harmonization platform''' is at the core of High-throughput Sequencing Computational Standards for Regulatory Sciences (HTS-CSRS) project. Its mission is to provide the scientific community with a framework to harmonize biocomputing, promote interoperability, and verify bioinformatics protocols (https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/htscsrs). For more information, see the project description on the FDA Extramural Research page (https://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/SpecialTopics/RegulatoryScience/ucm491893.htm

==HIVE architecture==
[[File:HIVE-hardware.png|300px|right|HIVE-hardware]]

*'''Hardware architecture''': At the core of HIVE there exists a solid backbone hardware made of few redundant critical components and scalable compute and storage units. The diagram at the right demonstrates the connectivity and components assignations for such HIVE cluster. Core components providing the vital functions for HIVE cloud include

The '''history of agriculture''' records the [[domestication]] of plants and animals and the development and dissemination of techniques for raising them productively. [[Agriculture]] began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of [[Taxon|taxa]]. At least eleven separate regions of the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] were involved as independent [[centers of origin]].

Wild [[cereal|grains]] were collected and eaten from at least 20,000 BC. From around 9500 BC, the eight [[Neolithic founder crops]]&amp;nbsp;– [[emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], [[barley|hulled barley]], [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]], [[chick pea]]s, and [[flax]]&amp;nbsp;– were cultivated in the [[Levant]]. [[Rye]] may have been cultivated earlier but this remains controversial. [[Rice]] was domesticated in China by 6200 BC with earliest known cultivation from 5700 BC, followed by [[mung bean|mung]], [[soy]] and [[Azuki bean|azuki]] beans. [[Pig]]s were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC, followed by [[sheep]] between 11,000 BC and 9000 BC. [[Cattle]] were domesticated from the wild [[aurochs]] in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8500 BC. [[Sugarcane]] and some [[List of root vegetables|root vegetables]] were domesticated in [[New Guinea]] around 7000 BC. [[Sorghum]] was domesticated in the [[Sahel]] region of Africa by 5000 BC. In the [[Andes]] of South America, the [[potato]] was domesticated between 8000 BC and 5000 BC, along with [[Phaseolus|beans]], [[coca]], [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s. [[Banana]]s were cultivated and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] in the same period in [[Papua New Guinea]]. [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|In Mesoamerica]], wild [[teosinte]] was domesticated to [[maize]] by 4000 BC. [[Cotton]] was domesticated in [[Peru]] by 3600 BC. [[Camels]] were domesticated late, perhaps around 3000 BC.

The [[Bronze Age]], from c. 3300 BC, witnessed the intensification of agriculture in civilizations such as [[Mesopotamia]]n [[Sumer]], [[ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] of South Asia, [[ancient China]], and [[ancient Greece]]. During the [[Iron Age]] and era of [[classical antiquity]], the expansion of [[ancient Rome]], both [[Roman Republic|the Republic]] and then [[Roman Empire|the Empire]], throughout the [[ancient Mediterranean]] and [[Western Europe]] built upon existing systems of agriculture while also establishing the [[manorial]] system that became a bedrock of medieval agriculture. In the [[Middle Ages]], both [[Arab Agricultural Revolution|in the Islamic world]] and in Europe, agriculture was transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees such as the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] to Europe by way of [[Al-Andalus]]. After the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, the [[Columbian exchange]] brought New World crops such as [[maize]], [[potato]]es, [[sweet potato]]es, and [[manioc]] to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and [[turnip]]s, and livestock including horses, cattle, sheep, and goats to the Americas.

[[Irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], and [[fertilizer]]s were introduced soon after the [[Neolithic Revolution]] and developed much further in the past 200 years, starting with the [[British Agricultural Revolution]]. Since 1900, agriculture in the developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as human labour has been replaced by [[Mechanized farming|mechanization]], and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s, and [[selective breeding]]. The [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]] allowed the synthesis of [[ammonium nitrate]] fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing [[crop yields]]. Modern agriculture has raised social, political, and environmental issues including [[water pollution]], [[biofuel]]s, [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[tariff]]s and [[farm subsidies]]. In response, [[organic farming]] developed in the twentieth century as an alternative to the use of synthetic pesticides.

===Origin hypotheses===
[[File:Native Encampment by Skinner Prout, from Australia (1876, vol II).jpg|thumb|left|[[Indigenous Australian]] camp by Skinner Prout, 1876]]

Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing [[sedentism]]; examples are the [[Natufian culture]] in the [[Levant]], and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate that wild st&lt;!--no r!--&gt;ands that had been harvested previously started to be planted, but were not immediately domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, G.C. (1996) "Late Pleistocene changes in wild plant-foods available to hunter-gatherers of the northern Fertile Crescent: Possible preludes to cereal cultivation". In D.R. Harris (ed.) ''The Origins and Spread of Agriculture and Pastoralism in Eurasia'', UCL Books, London, pp. 159–203; Sato, Y. (2003) "Origin of rice cultivation in the Yangtze River basin". In Y. Yasuda (ed.) ''The Origins of Pottery and Agriculture'', Roli Books, New Delhi, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerritsen2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerritsen, R. |date=2008 |title=Australia and the Origins of Agriculture |publisher=Archaeopress |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Localised climate change is the favoured explanation for the origins of agriculture in the Levant.&lt;ref name=NatGeog&gt;{{cite web|title=The Development of Agriculture |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/ |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=15 June 2016 |date=2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/ |archivedate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When major climate change took place after the last [[ice age]] (c. 11,000 BC), much of the earth became subject to long dry seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Climate |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/ctl/10k.html |publisher=National Climate Data Center |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions favoured [[annual plant]]s which die off in the long dry season, leaving a [[dormancy|dormant]] [[seed]] or [[tuber]]. An abundance of readily storable wild grains and [[legume|pulses]] enabled hunter-gatherers in some areas to form the first settled villages at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Development of Agriculture |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/ |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |accessdate=20 June 2016 |date=2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414142437/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/ |archivedate=14 April 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early people began altering communities of [[flora]] and [[fauna]] for their own benefit through means such as [[fire-stick farming]] and [[forest gardening]] very early.&lt;ref name="Biggest Estate on Earth, Australia"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gammage | first=Bill  |author-link=Bill Gammage | date=October 2011 | title=The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines made Australia | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUddY9fGkNMC | publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin | isbn=978-1742377483}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design |author=Douglas John McConnell |year=2003 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;pg=PA1 |isbn=978-0754609582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka |author=McConnell, Douglas John |year=1992 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&amp;pg=PA1 |isbn=978-9251028988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough [[rachis]] and larger seeds of [[cereal]]s from just after the [[Younger Dryas]] (about 9500 BC) in the early [[Holocene]] in the [[Levant]] region of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. [[Monophyletic]] characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal [[rachis]] could have occurred quite naturally.&lt;ref name="PNAS"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Allaby, Robin G. |author2=Fuller, Dorian Q. |author3=Brown, Terence A. |title=The genetic expectations of a protracted model for the origins of domesticated crops |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=2008 |volume=105 |issue=37 |pages=13982–13986 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/105/37/13982.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.0803780105 |pmid=18768818 |pmc=2544565|bibcode=2008PNAS..10513982A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 7000 BC, the [[Sumer]]ians systematized and scaled up sowing and harvesting in Mesopotamia's fertile soil. By 8000 BC, farming was entrenched on the banks of the [[River Nile]]. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop.

{{See also|Neolithic Revolution}}

[[Sumer]]ian farmers grew the cereals [[barley]] and [[wheat]], starting to live in villages from about 8000 BC.  Given the low rainfall of the region, agriculture relied on the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers. Irrigation canals leading from the rivers permitted the growth of cereals in large enough quantities to support cities. The first ploughs appear in [[pictograph]]s from Uruk around 3000 BC; seed-ploughs that funneled seed into the ploughed furrow appear on [[seal (emblem)|seals]] around 2300 BC. Vegetable crops included [[chickpea]]s, [[lentil]]s, peas, beans, [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[lettuce]], [[leek]]s and [[Mustard plant|mustard]]. They grew fruits including [[Date (fruit)|dates]], grapes, apples, melons, and figs. Alongside their farming, Sumerians also caught fish and hunted [[fowl]] and [[gazelle]]. The meat of sheep, goats, cows and poultry was eaten, mainly by the elite. Fish was preserved by drying, salting and smoking.&lt;ref name=BritMus&gt;{{cite web |title=Farming |url=http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/staff/resources/background/bg08/home.html |publisher=[[British Museum]] |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616222522/http://www.mesopotamia.co.uk/staff/resources/background/bg08/home.html |archivedate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The fine art of food |first=Reay |last=Tannahill |publisher=Folio Society |year=1968 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The civilization of [[Ancient Egypt]] was indebted to the  [[Nile River]] and its dependable seasonal flooding. The river's predictability and the fertile soil allowed the Egyptians to build an empire on the basis of great agricultural wealth.

Records from the [[Warring States]], [[Qin Dynasty]], and [[Han Dynasty]] provide a picture of early [[Agriculture in China|Chinese agriculture]] from the 5th century {{sc|bc}} to 2nd century {{sc|ad}} which included a nationwide [[granary]] system and widespread use of [[sericulture]]. An important early Chinese book on agriculture is the [[Qimin Yaoshu]] of {{sc|ad}} 535, written by Jia Sixie.&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 2 55 56"&gt;[[Joseph Needham|Needham, Joseph]] (1986). ''Science and Civilization in China: Volume 6, Part 2''. Taipei: Caves Books Ltd. pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; Jia's writing style was straightforward and lucid relative to the elaborate and allusive writing typical of the time. Jia's book was also very long, with over one hundred thousand written [[Chinese characters]], and it quoted many other Chinese books that were written previously, but no longer survive.&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 2 56"/&gt; The contents of Jia's 6th century book include sections on land preparation, seeding, cultivation, orchard management, forestry, and animal husbandry. The book also includes peripherally related content covering trade and culinary uses for crops.&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 2 57"&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The work and the style in which it was written proved influential on later Chinese [[agronomist]]s, such as [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] and his groundbreaking ''Nong Shu'' of 1313.&lt;ref name="needham volume 6 part 2 56"&gt;Needham, Volume 6, Part 2, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Greco-Roman world]] of [[Classical antiquity]], [[Roman agriculture]] was built on techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] laid the groundwork for the [[manorial]] economic system, involving [[serfdom]], which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in [[History of Rome|Rome]] can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18–88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80–500 iugera (singular [[iugerum]]). Large estates (called [[latifundia]]) were over 500 iugera.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, K. D. (1970), ''Roman Farming'' (Cornell University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Empire|The Romans]] had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; [[Tenant farmer|tenant farming]] or [[sharecropping]] in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

In [[Mesoamerica]], the [[Aztec]]s were active farmers and had an agriculturally focused economy. The land around [[Lake Texcoco]] was fertile, but not large enough to produce the amount of food needed for the population of their expanding empire. The Aztecs developed irrigation systems, formed [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] hillsides, fertilized their soil, and developed [[chinampa]]s or artificial islands, also known as "floating gardens". The [[Maya civilization|Mayas]] between 400 BC to 900 AD used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/101105/full/news.2010.587.html|title=Mayans converted wetlands to farmland |author=Mascarelli, Amanda |journal=Nature |date=5 November 2010 |doi=10.1038/news.2010.587}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.soils.org/publications/sh/articles/53/6/3 |title=Invisible Artifacts: Uncovering Secrets of Ancient Maya Agriculture with Modern Soil Science |journal=Soil Horizons |author=Morgan, John |date=6 November 2013 |doi=10.2136/sh2012-53-6-lf |volume=53 |issue=6 |page=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321200108/https://www.soils.org/publications/sh/articles/53/6/3 |archivedate=21 March 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system of [[companion planting]] called [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|the Three Sisters]] was [[Agriculture on the prehistoric Great Plains|developed in North America]]. Three crops that complemented each other were planted together: [[winter squash]], [[maize]] (corn), and climbing [[bean]]s (typically [[Phaseolus acutifolius|tepary beans]] or [[Phaseolus vulgaris|common beans]]). The maize provides a structure for the beans to climb, eliminating the need for poles. The beans provide the [[nitrogen]] to the soil that the other plants use, and the squash spreads along the ground, blocking the [[sunlight]], helping prevent the establishment of [[weed]]s.

From the time of British colonization of [[Australia]] in 1788, [[Indigenous Australians]] were characterised as nomadic [[hunter-gatherers]] who did not engage in agriculture, despite evidence to the contrary. In 1969, the archaeologist [[Rhys Jones (archaeologist)|Rhys Jones]] proposed that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning as a way of enhancing natural productivity, what has been termed [[fire-stick farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jones | first1=R. | year=1969 | title=Fire-stick Farming |  journal=Australian Natural History | volume=16 |  page=224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the [[Gunditjmara]] and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, E. (1988) ''Complex Hunter-Gatherers: A Late Holocene Example from Temperate Australia''. British Archaeological Reports, Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeologist [[Harry Lourandos]] suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of 'intensification' in progress across Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Lourandos, H. (1997) ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers: New Perspectives in Australian Prehistory'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years. These concepts led the historian [[Bill Gammage]] to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.&lt;ref name="Biggest Estate on Earth, Australia" /&gt;

In two regions of Australia, the central west coast and eastern central Australia, forms of early agriculture may have been practiced. People living in permanent settlements of over 200 residents sowed or planted on a large scale and stored the harvested food.

{{Main|Arab agricultural revolution}}

From the 8th century, the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] underwent a transformation in agricultural practice, described by the historian Andrew Watson as the [[Arab agricultural revolution]].&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt; This transformation was driven by a number of factors including the diffusion of many crops and plants along Muslim trade routes, the spread of more advanced farming techniques, and an agricultural-economic system which promoted increased yields and efficiency. The shift in agricultural practice changed the economy, [[population distribution]], vegetation cover, agricultural production, population levels, [[Urbanization|urban growth]], the distribution of the labour force, cooking, diet, and clothing across the Islamic world. Muslim traders covered much of the [[Old World]], and trade enabled the diffusion of many crops, plants and farming techniques across the region, as well as the adaptation of crops, plants and techniques from beyond the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=Watson/&gt; This diffusion introduced major crops to Europe by way of [[Al-Andalus]], along with the techniques for their cultivation and cuisine. Sugar cane, rice, and cotton were among the major crops transferred, along with [[citrus]] and other fruit trees, nut trees, vegetables such as [[aubergine]], [[spinach]] and [[chard]], and the use of &lt;!--imported--&gt; spices such as [[cumin]], [[coriander]], [[nutmeg]] and [[cinnamon]]. Intensive irrigation, [[crop rotation]], and agricultural manuals were widely adopted. Irrigation, partly based on Roman technology, made use of [[noria]] water wheels, [[water mill]]s, dams and reservoirs.&lt;ref name=Watson&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew M. |last=Watson |date=1974 |title=The Arab Agricultural Revolution and Its Diffusion, 700–1100 |journal=The Journal of Economic History |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=8–35 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700079602}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Andrew M. |last=Watson |date=1983 |title=Agricultural Innovation in the Early Islamic World |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=052124711X |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NatGeographic2015&gt;{{cite book |author=National Geographic |title=Food Journeys of a Lifetime |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h2Q5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126 |year=2015 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |isbn=978-1426216091 |pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{main|Agriculture in the Middle Ages}}

The Middle Ages saw further improvements in agriculture. Monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The [[manorial system]] allowed large landowners to control their land and its laborers, in the form of peasants or [[serf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html |title=Medieval Horticulture/Agriculture |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=24 April 2013 |author=Jourdan, Pablo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414172021/http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html |archivedate=14 April 2013 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, the [[Arab world]] was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents.

By {{sc|ad}} 900, developments in [[smelting|iron smelting]] allowed for increased production in Europe, leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs, hand tools and [[horse shoe]]s. The [[carruca]] heavy plough improved on the earlier [[scratch plough]], with the adoption of the Chinese [[mouldboard plough]] to turn over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of northern European forests and an increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=White, Lynn |title=The Life of the Silent Majority |work=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages |editor=Hoyt, Robert S. |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |date=1967 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andersen |first1=Thomas Barnebeck |last2=Jensen |first2=Peter Sandholt |last3=Skovsgaard |first3=Christian Volmar |title=The Heavy Plough and the Agricultural Revolution in  Medieval Europe |url=http://www.ehes.org/EHES_70.pdf |publisher=European Historical Economics Society |date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some farmers in Europe moved from a two field [[crop rotation]] to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year.

After 1492, a [[Columbian exchange|global exchange]] of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred. Maize, potatoes, [[sweet potatoes]] and [[manioc]] were the key crops that spread from the New World to the Old, while varieties of wheat, barley, rice and [[turnip]]s traveled from the Old World to the New. There had been few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] caused population growth around the world and a lasting effect on many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/american-indians/essays/columbian-exchange |title=The Columbian Exchange |publisher=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History |author=Crosby, Alfred |accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maize and cassava were introduced from Brazil into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/suprtubr.htm |title=Super-Sized Cassava Plants May Help Fight Hunger In Africa |publisher=The Ohio State University |author=Wagner, Holly |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208143623/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/suprtubr.htm |archivedate=2013-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/16/default.html|title=Advances in Maize Streak Virus Disease Research in Eastern and Southern Africa |editor1=Florence Wambugu |editor2=John Wafula |year=2000 |publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its introduction from South America to Spain in the late 1500s, the potato became a staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The increased supply of food reduced disease, increased births and reduced mortality, causing a population boom throughout the [[British Empire]], the US and Europe.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Jeff"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chapman, Jeff |url=http://www.history-magazine.com/potato.html |title=The Impact of the Potato |journal=History Magazine |date=2000 |issue=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000511090854/http://www.history-magazine.com/potato.html |archivedate=11 May 2000 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, in the form of [[guano]] imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, in the form of an [[arsenic]] compound used to fight [[Colorado potato beetle]]s. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain had caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed, including 17 major famines in England between 1523 and 1623. The resulting dependence on the potato however caused the [[European Potato Failure]], a disastrous crop failure from [[potato blight|disease]] that resulted in widespread [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone]].&lt;ref name="Mann, Charles C"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mann, Charles C. |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Potato-Changed-the-World.html |title=How the Potato Changed History |journal=Smithsonian |issue=November 2011 }} Adapted from ''1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created'', by Charles C.

Between the 16th century and the mid-19th century, Britain saw a large increase in agricultural productivity and net output. New agricultural practices like [[enclosure]], mechanization, [[four-field crop rotation]] to maintain soil nutrients, and [[selective breeding]] enabled an [[Malthusian trap|unprecedented population growth]] to 5.7 million in 1750, freeing up a significant percentage of the workforce, and thereby helped drive the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The productivity of wheat went up from {{convert|19|bushels}} per [[acre]] in 1720 to around {{convert|30|bushels}} by 1840, marking a major turning point in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Snell |first=K.D.M. |title=Annals of the Labouring Poor, Social Change and Agrarian England 1660–1900 |year=1985 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521245486}} Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jethro Tull seed drill (1762).png|thumb|upright|[[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s seed drill, invented in 1701]]

Advice on more productive techniques for farming began to appear in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as [[Samuel Hartlib]], [[Walter Blith]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Thirsk|first=Joan|title='Blith, Walter (bap. 1605, d. 1654)'|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008| url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/2655|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places [[crop rotation]] was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harskamp, Jaap |title=The Low Countries and the English Agricultural Revolution |date=2009 |journal=Gastronomica |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=32–41 |jstor=10.1525/gfc.2009.9.3.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mechanisation and rationalisation of agriculture was another important factor. [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]] and [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke]] introduced [[selective breeding]], and initiated a process of inbreeding to maximise desirable traits from the mid 18th century, such as the [[New Leicester]] sheep. Machines were invented to improve the efficiency of various agricultural operation, such as [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s [[seed drill]] of 1701 that mechanised seeding at the correct depth and spacing and [[Andrew Meikle]]'s [[threshing machine]] of 1784. Ploughs were steadily improved, from Joseph Foljambe's [[Plough#Heavy Ploughs|Rotherham iron plough]] in 1730&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bahs.org.uk/AGHR/ARTICLES/05n2a2.pdf |title=The British Plough: Some Stages in its Development |author=Payne, F.G. |publisher=British Agricultural History Society|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[James Small (inventor)|James Small]]'s improved "Scots Plough" metal in 1763.

[[John Bennet Lawes]] began the scientific investigation of fertilization at the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in 1843. He investigated the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield and founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842. Fertilizer, in the shape of [[sodium nitrate]] deposits in [[Chile]], was imported to Britain by [[John Thomas North]] as well as [[guano]] (birds droppings). The first commercial process for fertilizer production was the obtaining of [[super phosphate|phosphate]] from the dissolution of [[coprolite]]s in [[sulphuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Coprolite Industry |url=http://www.cambridgeshirehistory.com/People/coproliteindustry.html |publisher=Cambridgeshire History |accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch method]] for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] represented a major breakthrough and allowed [[crop yields]] to overcome previous constraints.

The initiatives, led by [[Norman Borlaug]] and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and [[pesticide]]s to farmers.&lt;ref name="Hazell 2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter B.R. |last=Hazell |title=The Asian Green Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=frNfVx-KZOcC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2009 |work=IFPRI Discussion Paper |publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute |id=GGKEY:HS2UT4LADZD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Synthetic nitrogen, along with mined [[rock phosphate]], pesticides and mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century. Increased supply of [[grain]]s has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced as a part of the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. [[Thomas Malthus]] famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.&lt;ref name="BumperCrop"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/business/worldbusiness/08farmers.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Sometimes a Bumper Crop Is Too Much of a Good Thing |author1=Barrionuevo, Alexei |author2=Bradsher, Keith |date=8 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Green Revolution significantly increased rice yields in Asia, yield increases have not occurred in the past 15–20 years.&lt;ref name=Tilman2002&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Tilman, D.; Cassman, K.G.; Matson, P.A.; Naylor, R.; Polasky, S. |title=Agricultural sustainability and intensive production practices |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6898 |pages=671–677 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12167873 |doi=10.1038/nature01014 |url=http://cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1860.pdf |bibcode=2002Natur.418..671T }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic "yield potential" has increased for wheat, but the yield potential for rice has not increased since 1966, and the yield potential for maize has "barely increased in 35 years".&lt;ref name=Tilman2002/&gt; It takes only a decade or two for herbicide-resistant weeds to emerge, and insects become resistant to insecticides within about a decade, delayed somewhat by crop rotation.&lt;ref name=Tilman2002/&gt;

===Organic agriculture===
{{Main|Organic farming}}

For most of its history, agriculture has been [[organic agriculture|organic]], without synthetic [[fertilisers]] or [[pesticides]], and without [[GMOs]]. With the advent of chemical agriculture, [[Rudolf Steiner]] called for farming without synthetic pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 laid the foundation for [[biodynamic agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Paull | first1=John | year=2011 | title=Attending the First Organic Agriculture Course: Rudolf Steiner's Agriculture Course at Koberwitz, 1924 | url=http://orgprints.org/18809/1/Paull2011KoberwitzEJSS.pdf | journal=European Journal of Social Sciences | volume=21 | issue=1| pages=64–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Northbourne]] developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of [[organic farming]] in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic farming is now practiced in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paull, John |date=2014 |url=http://orgprints.org/26547/12/26547.pdf |title=Lord Northbourne, the man who invented organic farming, a biography |journal=Journal of Organic Systems |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=31–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15224">[[File:Ab food 04.jpg|thumb|Dried Apricots]]'''Intermediate moisture foods (IMF)''' are shelf-stable products that have [[Water activity|water activities]] of 0.6-0.84, with a moisture content ranging from 15% - 40% and are edible without rehydration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/UCM517399.pdf|title=Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food: Draft Guidance for Industry|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These food products are below the minimum water activity for most bacteria (0.90), but are susceptible to yeast and mold growth.  Historically, ancient civilizations would produce IMF using methods such as sun drying, roasting over fire and adding salt to preserve food for winter months or when preparing for travel.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Currently, this form of processing is achieved by using one of four methods: partial drying, osmotic drying using a humectant, dry infusion and by formulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960758611|title=Food processing technology : principles and practice|last=Fellows|first=Fellows, P.|date=2017|publisher=Woodhead Publishing/Elsevier Science|year=|isbn=9780081019078|edition= 4th|location=Kent|pages=|oclc=960758611}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of products are classified as IMF such as [[dried fruit]]s, sugar added commodities, marshmallows, and pie fillings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Shelf-life and safety ==
The purpose of IMF foods is to achieve a water activity that the food can be stored safely without refrigeration.  However, the food is not sterile.  ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is a microorganism of concern as it can grow and produce specific [[enterotoxin]]s in water activities of 0.83-0.86 under aerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because of this, proper handling, storage, hygiene and [[good manufacturing practice]]s are necessary to prevent ''Staphylococcus aureus.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Molds of ''[[Aspergillus|Aspergillis]] and [[Penicillium]]'' species can grow and produce harmful [[mycotoxin]]s at water activity 0.77-0.85.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ''[[Salmonella]]'' and ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' are the primary [[pathogen]]s of concern with low-moisture foods and IMFs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/sh-proxy/en/?lnk=1&amp;url=https%253A%252F%252Fworkspace.fao.org%252Fsites%252Fcodex%252FStandards%252FCAC%2BRCP%2B75-2015%252FCXP_075e.pdf|title=Code of Hygienic Practice for Low-Moisture Foods|last=World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|first=|date=2015|website=Codex Alimentarius|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most illnesses associated with low-moisture foods or IMFs have been caused by ''Salmonella'' spp. To reduce the risk of bacterial growth, products are treated with a combination of low [[pH]], addition of sugar, salt and preservatives, and a thermal process that can eliminate pathogens and extend [[Shelf life|shelf-life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leistner|first=Lothar|date=2000|title=Basic aspects of food preservation by hurdle technology|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/128773/mod_resource/content/1/Leistner.2000.pdf|journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology|volume=55|pages=181–186|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of yeasts and molds, chemical preservatives such as [[Sorbic acid|sorbates]] and [[propionate]]s are used to inhibit their growth.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Processing ==
=== Partial drying ===
To achieve 0.6-0.84 water activity in food products, partial drying is employed for raw food that naturally have a high amount of [[humectant]]s such as raisins, apricots, prunes and sultanas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Humectants are solutes (such as sugar or salt) that immobilize water in food.  The drying process removes free water, and the humectants in the product bind the rest of the water, not allowing it to be utilized for chemical reactions or for microbial use.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.amac.md/Biblioteca/data/30/14/10/60.2.pdf#page=283|title=Water Activity in Foods|last=Barbosa-Canovas, Gustavo; Fontana Jr., Anthony J.; Schmidt, Shelly J.; Labuza Theodore P.|first=|publisher=IFT Press/Blackwell Publishing|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=273–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Osmotic drying using a humectant ===
Osmotic dehydration is the process of soaking food in highly concentrated solutions of humectant.  Salt and sugar are commonly used humectants for this process.  Water [[diffusion]] from the food to the humectant solution is caused by [[osmotic pressure]].  The water is replaced by the humectant, which results in a lowered water activity for the food product.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Osmotic dehydration process results in two way mass transfer in regards to the moisture lost and the solids gained, with moisture loss being much greater than the addition of solids.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sagar V. R.; Suresh K. P.|first=|date=2010|title=Recent advances in drying and dehydration of fruits and vegetables: a review|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3550996/pdf/13197_2010_Article_10.pdf|journal=Journal of Food Science Technology|volume=47 |issue=1|pages=15–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Advantages of osmotic dehydration include low processing temperatures, short drying times, and 20-30% lower energy consumption than typical dehydration processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Sugar is used as the humectant for candied intermediate moisture fruits, and salt is used for intermediate moisture vegetables and fish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Additionally, a mixture of humectants can be formulated to manipulate the sensory properties of the food product.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Osmotic drying using a humectant results in a soft texture in the final product.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Dry infusion ===
Dry infusion is the combination of partial dehydration and osmotic dehydration using a humectant.  The food product is first dehydrated and then the resultant product is added to a humectant solution to reach the desired water activity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  This method is desirable because it results in a higher quality and more appealing product.  However, more energy is used for this method because it is two processing steps combined.  Dry infusion is primarily employed by the U.S military and NASA for production of IMF to produce safe, palatable food that can be consumed much later than it is produced.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Formulated intermediate moisture foods ===
Many types of food are specially formulated to achieve water activity in the IMF range.  Food ingredients are mixed with salt and/or sugar, and additives (such as [[propylene glycol]] and [[potassium sorbate]]) and then subjected to processing methods such as cooking, [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] or dehydration to result in an intermediate moisture final product.  Examples of formulated IMF are confectioneries and pet food.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Fruits and vegetables ===
[[File:Dried pineapple.JPG|thumb|163x163px|Dried Pineapples]]
Sugar is added to fruit to protect against microbial contamination and reduce water activity in the fruit. This allows the fruit to be more stable at room temperature. Some examples are strawberries, prunes, peaches, apricots, and pineapples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handling and Preservation of Fruits and Vegetables by Combined Methods for Rural Areas|last=Barbosa-Cánovas, Gustavo V.; Fernández-Molina, Juan J.; Alzamora, Stella M.; Tapia, Maria S.; López-Malo, Aurelio; Chanes, Jorge Welti|first=|publisher=FAO Agricultural Services Bulletin 149|year=2003|isbn=|location=Rome, Italy|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMF blueberries are prepared by osmotic dehydration.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34077580|title=Food preservation by moisture control : fundamentals and applications|date=1995|publisher=Technomic Pub.

W. (Grahame Warwick)|isbn=0306472635|location=New York|oclc=50479233}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made from the hindquarter of beef cattle. Pastirma is a type of intermediate moisture food and can be stored for several months in humid climates. The meat is salted and dried to reduce water activity and increase microbial safety. Additionally, nitrites are added for preservation. The final product has 5% salt and a moisture content between 30-35%.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Pet food ===
Semi-moist pet food such as chewy dog treats and soft cat treats are shelf-stable, soft and do not have a high moisture content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3119630|title=The technology of food preservation|last=W.|first=Desrosier, Norman|date=1977|publisher=AVI Pub.

Additionally, they have been found to be more palatable to pets than dry pet food products.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Lots of Candies.jpg|thumb|Various Candy and Confectionaries|183x183px]]

Cakes are considered to be intermediate moisture foods because of their moisture content (18-28%), and have low enough water activity that preserve the safety and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B0-12-227055-X/00145-0|title=CAKES {{!}} Nature of Cakes|last=Cauvain|first=S.P.|pages=751–756|doi=10.1016/b0-12-227055-x/00145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of baked goods and confectionery that come under this category are fruit cakes, pie fillings, candies, marshmallows, jams, pizza crust. [[Tutti frutti (food)|Tutti Fruiti]] is a candy-like product that can be made from a variety of fruit, most commonly papaya.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Raw pieces of unripe papaya are boiled and layered with sucrose until reaching 68 degrees [[brix]]. The solution is then air dried until a moisture content of 25.7% is reached.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Advantages ==
Intermediate moisture foods utilize hurdle technology by lowering water activity, reducing pH and using preservatives. Most bacteria do not grow under a water activity of 0.90 and IMF processing methods reduce water activity to 0.60-0.84.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; IMFs are often ready-to-eat and do not require refrigeration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is especially important in countries with tropical climates and minimal storage and processing capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leistner|first=Lothar|date=1992|title=Food Preservation by Combined Methods|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/128769/mod_resource/content/1/Leistner_1992.pdf|journal=Food Research International|volume=25|pages=151–158|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nitrite]]s and [[sulfite]]s are added to food to prolong shelf life and delay flavor and color changes. Propylene glycol reduces water activity and acts as a plasticizing agent to give food its desired texture.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Compared to [[Canning (food preservation method)|canning]], [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], and freezing, IMF food processing is less rigorous and results in less nutrient loss.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This is because compared to other processing techniques, IMF processes are at lower temperatures, pressures, and there is no water leaching of nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Additionally, IMF production is more energy efficient compared to conventional processes including canning and freezing since IMFs do not require refrigeration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The energy required for canning and freezing is costly, thus IMF are common in developing countries.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Concerns ==
Since microbes, namely ''Salmonella'' and ''Bacillus cereus,'' can persist in IMFs, other hurdles including reduction in pH and the use of preservatives is not unusual.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; However, additives such as nitrites and sulfites are associated with health concerns. Nitrites have a negative connotation in the food industry since they can combine with secondary [[amine]]s to form nitrosamines, which are [[carcinogen]]ic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dahle|first=H. K.|date=December 1979|title=Nitrite as a food additive|journal=NIPH annals|volume=2|issue=2|pages=17–24|issn=0332-5652|pmid=548837}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrites are linked to an increase risk in cancer and heart disease.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Sulfite is another additive that is commonly avoided due to people having a sensitivity to sulfites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vally|first=Hassan|last2=Misso|first2=Neil LA|date=2012|title=Adverse reactions to the sulphite additives|journal=Gastroenterology and Hepatology From Bed to Bench|volume=5|issue=1|pages=16–23|issn=2008-2258|pmc=4017440|pmid=24834193}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yeast]] and [[mold]] are not fully inhibited by IMF processing because these microorganisms can tolerate water activity as low as 0.80.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Browning (food process)|Browning]] can occur during storage of Intermediate moisture fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Finally, sugar used commonly added as a humectant increases the caloric value of the food.

'''Janice''' "'''Jan'''" '''Brandt''' is an American [[businesswoman]] and vice chair emeritus of [[America Online]]/[[Time Warner]]. She is known for her famous direct marketing campaign at AOL that increased the number of subscribers from 200,000 to more than 22 million.&lt;ref name="podcast"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCullough|first1=Brian|title=She Gave the World a Billion AOL CDs - An Interview with Marketing Legend Jan Brandt|url=http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/08/she-gave-the-world-a-billion-aol-cds-an-interview-with-marketing-legend-jan-brandt/|website=Internet History Podcast|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dmyear2001"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hatch|first1=Denny|title=2001 Direct Marketer of the Year|url=http://www.targetmarketingmag.com/article/2001-direct-marketer-year-28374/all/|website=TargetMarketing|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=1 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career ==
Jan Brandt was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and moved to New Jersey at the age of eight. She graduated from [[Boston University]]'s School of Public Communications. Following graduation, she began working as a [[copywriter]] at [[Xerox]] Education Publications in [[Middletown, Connecticut]]. She enrolled in night courses at the [[University of Connecticut]] and decided to switch careers to marketing. After a brief period working for [[Colonial Penn]] in [[Philadelphia]], Brandt moved to [[Palo Alto]] to join Education Today publishing with [[Thomas O. Ryder]], where she worked for 10 years. She then briefly returned to [[Xerox]] Education Publications, which by then had been acquired by Newfield Publications, before being hired by [[Steve Case]] as vice president of marketing of [[AOL]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="dmyear2001" /&gt;

== Career at AOL ==
[[File:NoMoreAolCDs in Aachen.JPG|thumb|AOL free trial CDs sent to a student dormitory in Aachen, Germany]]
Brandt was hired with the explicit goal to grow the subscriber base and was given free rein over [[AOL]]'s marketing strategies. After AOL began sending complimentary discs to people who requested them, Brandt set up a direct marketing campaign to distribute AOL installation [[floppy disk|diskettes]] in the mail. The trial campaign cost $250,000 and had an average response of over 10% [[diffusion (business)|uptake]], with some mailing lists pulling as high as 16-18%.&lt;ref name="dmyear2001" /&gt; This prompted Brandt to expand the campaign beyond direct mailing and start working with nonconventional distribution partners, such as airlines and cereal companies.&lt;ref name="podcast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pardes|first1=Arielle|title=Inside the Intense, Insular World of AOL Disc Collecting|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/inside-the-weird-world-of-aol-disc-collecting-511|publisher=VICE|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, 50% of the [[CD]]s produced worldwide had an AOL logo.&lt;ref name="tc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Siegler|first1=MG|title=How Much Did It Cost AOL To Send Us Those CDs In The 90s? "A Lot!," Says Steve Case|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/12/27/aol-discs-90s/|website=TechCrunch|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "[[carpet bombing]]" strategy was instrumental in moving AOL beyond [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[CompuServe]] to dominate the [[online service provider]] market.&lt;ref name="podcast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tc" /&gt;

In 2002, Brandt stepped down as vice chair and chief marketing officer of AOL to take a part-time consulting position.&lt;ref name="stepdown" /&gt;

== Personal life ==
Brandt has been politically active since the 1990s, and a longtime supporter of [[EMILY's List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roller|first1=Emma|last2=Stamm|first2=Stephanie|title=Meet the Tech Donors who are Dominating the Midterms|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/10/meet-the-tech-donors-who-are-dominating-the-midterms/455931/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She currently sits on the board of directors for [[Women for Women International]], a humanitarian organization for providing aid to women in war-torn regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women for Women International|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Women_for_Women_International|website=SourceWatch|publisher=Center for Media and Democracy|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
Brandt was named twice by [[Fortune Magazine]] as one the "50 Most Powerful Women in American Business", in 1999 and again in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Folpe|first1=Jane M.|title=FORTUNE's 50 Most Powerful Women|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/10/25/267818/index.htm|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=FORTUNE Magazine|date=25 October 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=David|first1=Grainger|title=The Power 50|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/10/16/289616/index.htm|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=FORTUNE Magazine|date=16 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
She also received Direct Marketing Days New York's "Direct Marketer of the Year" award in 2000,&lt;ref name="stepdown"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brandt to be Advisor as AOL Juggles Senior Leadership|url=http://www.chiefmarketer.com/brandt-to-be-advisor-as-aol-juggles-senior-leadership/|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=Chief Marketer|date=12 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2001 "Direct Marketer of the Year" award from Target Marketing.&lt;ref name="dmyear2001" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30157">Laws regarding "unauthorized access of a [[computer network]]" exist in many legal codes, though the wording and meaning differ from one to the next.  However, the interpretation of terms like "access" and "authorization" is not clear, and there is no general agreement on whether [[Piggybacking (internet access)|piggybacking]] (intentional access of an open [[Wi-Fi Network|Wi-Fi network]] without [[Intention (criminal law)|harmful intent]]) falls under this classification.&lt;ref name="Bierlein"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some jurisdictions prohibit it, some permit it, and others are not well-defined.

For example, a common but untested argument is that the [[802.11]] and [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] protocols operate on behalf of the owner, implicitly requesting permission to access the network, which the [[wireless router]] then authorizes.  (This would not apply if the user has other reason to know that their use is unauthorized, such as a written or unwritten notice.)

In addition to laws against unauthorized access on the user side, there are the issues of [[breach of contract]] with the [[Internet service provider]] on the network owner's side.  Many [[terms of service]] prohibit bandwidth sharing with others, though others allow it.  The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] maintains a list of ISPs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/Infra/Wireless_cellular_radio/wireless_friendly_isp_list.html|title=Wireless-Friendly ISPs|date=7 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow sharing of the Wi-Fi signal.

== Australia ==

Under Australian Law, "unauthorized access, modification or impairment" of data held in a computer system is a federal offence under the Criminal Code Act 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011C00123&lt;/ref&gt; The act refers specifically to ''data'' as opposed to network resources (connection).

== Canada ==

In [[Canadian law]], unauthorized access is addressed the ''[[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]'', s 342.1, which provides that:   "Every one who, fraudulently and without [[colour of right]]" obtains "computer services" from an access point is subject to criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-46/sec342.1.html ''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 342.1 (1) (a)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307063609/http://www.canlii.org/ca/sta/c-46/sec342.1.html |date=2008-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 326(1) of the ''Criminal Code'' may also be used to address unauthorized access of a computer network: '(1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently, maliciously, or without [[colour of right]]', '(b) uses any telecommunication facility or obtains any telecommunication service.'

In [[Morrisburg, Ontario]] in 2006, a man was arrested under section 326 of the ''Criminal Code''.  Ultimately the arrest was poorly reported, there does not seem to be any information available with regards to conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

But he can be ordered to protect the network with a password, to prevent copyright infringement".&lt;ref&gt;http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-09/cp160099de.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] had lobbied for not requiring passwords.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eff.org/files/2015/07/20/closedwifiasanobstacletolegitimatetrade-4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Japan ==

On April 28th, 2017 the [[Tokyo District Court]] ruled that accessing a wireless LAN network without authorization is not a crime, even if the network is protected with a password. In a case brought before the court involved a man named Hiroshi Fujita, who was accused of accessing a neighbors wi-fi network without authorization and sending virus-infected emails, and then using that to steal internet banking information and send funds to his own bank account without authorization. Hiroshi was found guilty of most of what he was accused of and sentenced to 8 years in prison. Regarding the unauthorized access of wireless networks, prosecutors argued that wi-fi passwords fall under the category of "secrets of wireless transmission" (無線通信の秘密) and that therefore obtaining and using passwords without permission of the network operator would fall under the category of unauthorized use of wireless transmission secrets, which is prohibited by law. However, the court ruled that the defendant is not guilty, stating in their ruling that wi-fi passwords do not fall under that category and therefore the unauthorized obtainment of passwords and subsequent accessing of protected wireless networks is not a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/national/20170427-OYT1T50095.html |title=無線ＬＡＮただ乗り、電波法は「無罪」…懸念も |publisher=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date=2017-04-28|language=ja}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russia ==
Although Russian criminal law does not explicitly forbid access to another person's network, there is a common judicial practice to qualify these cases as an "unathorized access to an information" (a broadly interpreted concept in Russian law regarding computer crimes) according to Article 272 of the Criminal Code. To construct the accusation, one considers ISP's billing data the information which has been accessed.

In addition, if the defendant have used any program (network scanner, for example) to access the network, he may also be charged by Article 273 (creation, usage and distribution of malware).

== Singapore ==
Piggybacking another person's unsecured wireless network is illegal in Singapore under section 6(1)(a) of the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act.&lt;ref name=st17apr&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thor|first1=Venessa|title=5 little-known laws of Singapore|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/the-big-story/explainers/story/5-little-known-laws-singapore-20140414|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=Straits Times|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cma-sg&gt;{{Singapore legislation | title=Computer Misuse Act | cap=50A | ed=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offender is liable to a fine of $10,000, imprisonment for up to 3 years, or both.&lt;ref name=st17apr /&gt;&lt;ref name=cma-sg /&gt;

In November 2006, the 17-year-old Garyl Tan Jia Luo, was arrested for tapping into his neighbour's wireless Internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/11/asia/AS_GEN_Singapore_Internet_Charges.php |title=Singapore teen faces 3 years' jail for tapping into another's wireless Internet |publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=2006-11-10 |accessdate=2007-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 December, Tan pleaded guilty to the charge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chua Hian Hou |title=Wi-Fi Thief Pleads Guilty: 17-Year-Old Piggybacked on Neighbour's Network |publisher=[[The Straits Times]] |date=2006-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 16 January 2007 he became the first person in Singapore to be convicted of the offense. He was sentenced by the [[Community Court (Singapore)|Community Court]] to 18 months' probation, half of which was to be served at a boys' home. For the remaining nine months, he had to stay indoors from 10:00 pm to 6:00 am. He was also sentenced to 80 hours of community service and banned from using the Internet for 18 months; his parents risked forfeiting a [[Singapore dollar|S$]]5,000 bond if he failed to abide by the ban. Tan was also given the option of enlisting early for [[National Service in Singapore|National Service]]. If he did so, he would not have to serve whatever remained of his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chua Hian Hou |title=18-Month Net Ban, Community Service for PC Game Addict |publisher=The Straits Times |date=2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ansley Ng |url=http://www.todayonline.com/articles/166274.asp |title=Illegal Wireless-Network User Sentenced to 18 Months' Probation |publisher=[[Today (Singapore newspaper)|Today]] |date=2007-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926221850/http://www.todayonline.com/articles/166274.asp |archivedate=2007-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 2007, Lin Zhenghuang was charged for using his neighbour's unsecured wireless network to post a bomb hoax online. In July 2005, Lin had posted a message entitled "Breaking News – [[Toa Payoh]] Hit by Bomb Attacks" on a forum managed by [[HardwareZone]]. Alarmed by the message, a user reported it to the authorities through the [[Government of Singapore]]'s eCitizen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecitizen.gov.sg|title=eCitizen|website=www.ecitizen.gov.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

The [[Computer Misuse Act 1990]], section 1 reads:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900018_en_1.htm Unauthorised access to computer material] - Computer Misuse Act 1990 (c. 18)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|(1) A person is guilty of an offence if—
: (a) he causes a computer to perform any function with intent to secure access to any program or data held in any computer;
: (b) the access he intends to secure is unauthorised; and
: (c) he knows at the time when he causes the computer to perform the function that is the case.}}

In [[London]], 2005, Gregory Straszkiewicz was the first person to be convicted of a related crime, "dishonestly obtaining an electronics communication service" (under s.125 [[Communications Act 2003]]).  Local residents complained that he was repeatedly trying to gain access to residential networks with a laptop from a car.  There was no evidence that he had any other [[Intention (criminal law)|criminal intent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

There are federal and state laws (in all 50 states) addressing the issue of unauthorized access to wireless networks.&lt;ref name=Bierlein/&gt; The laws vary widely between states. Some criminalize the mere unauthorized access of a network, while others require monetary damages for intentional breaching of security features. The majority of state laws do not specify what is meant by "unauthorized access". Regardless, enforcement is minimal in most states even where it is illegal, and detection is difficult in many cases.&lt;ref name="Bierlein"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An [[Illinois]] man was arrested in January 2006 for piggybacking on a [[Wi-Fi]] network. David M. Kauchak was the first person to be charged with "remotely accessing another computer system" in [[Winnebago County, Illinois|Winnebago County]].

In [[Sparta, Michigan]], 2007, Sam Peterson was arrested for checking his email each day using a café's wireless Internet access from a car parked nearby. A police officer became suspicious, stating, "I had a feeling a law was being broken, but I didn't know exactly what". When asked, the man explained to the officer what he was doing, as he did not know the act was illegal. The officer found a law against "unauthorized use of computer access", leading to an arrest and charges that could result in a five-year felony and $10,000 fine. The café owner was not aware of the law, either. "I didn't know it was really illegal, either. If he would have come in [to the coffee shop] it would have been fine." They did not press charges, but he was eventually sentenced to a $400 fine and 40 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In 2007, in [[Palmer, Alaska]], 21-year-old Brian Tanner was charged with "theft of services" and had his laptop confiscated after accessing [[Risk (game)#Computer implementations and video games|a gaming website]] at night from the parking lot outside the Palmer Public Library, as he was allowed to do during the day. The night before, the police had asked him to leave the parking lot, which he had started using because they had asked him not to use residential connections in the past. He was not ultimately charged with theft, but could still be charged with trespassing or not obeying a police order. The library director said that Tanner had not broken any rules, and local citizens criticized police for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

{{quote|I. A person is guilty of the computer crime of unauthorized access to a computer or computer network when, knowing that the person is not authorized to do so, he or she knowingly accesses or causes to be accessed any computer or computer network without authorization. It shall be an affirmative defense to a prosecution for unauthorized access to a computer or computer network that:

: (b) The person reasonably believed that the owner of the computer or computer network, or a person empowered to license access thereto, would have authorized the person to access without payment of any consideration; or
: (c) The person reasonably could not have known that his or her access was unauthorized.}}

There are additional provisions in the NH law, Section 638:17 Computer Related Offenses, as found by searching NH RSA's in December 2009.  They cover actual use of someone else's computer rather than simply "access":

{{quote|
II. A person is guilty of the computer crime of theft of computer services when he or she knowingly accesses or causes to be accessed or otherwise uses or causes to be used a computer or computer network with the purpose of obtaining unauthorized computer services.

III. A person is guilty of the computer crime of interruption of computer services when the person, without authorization, knowingly or recklessly disrupts or degrades or causes the disruption or degradation of computer services or denies or causes the denial of computer services to an authorized user of a computer or computer network.

IV. A person is guilty of the computer crime of misuse of computer or computer network information when: 
: (a) As a result of his or her accessing or causing to be accessed a computer or computer network, the person knowingly makes or causes to be made an unauthorized display, use, disclosure, or copy, in any form, of data residing in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer network; or 
: (b) The person knowingly or recklessly and without authorization: 
:: (1) Alters, deletes, tampers with, damages, destroys, or takes data intended for use by a computer or computer network, whether residing within or external to a computer or computer network; or 
:: (2) Intercepts or adds to data residing within a computer or computer network; or 
: (c) The person knowingly receives or retains data obtained in violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph; or 
: (d) The person knowingly uses or discloses any data he or she knows or believes was obtained in violation of subparagraph (a) or (b) of this paragraph.

V. A person is guilty of the computer crime of destruction of computer equipment when he or she, without authorization, knowingly or recklessly tampers with, takes, transfers, conceals, alters, damages, or destroys any equipment used in a computer or computer network, or knowingly or recklessly causes any of the foregoing to occur.

VI. A person is guilty of the computer crime of computer contamination if such person knowingly introduces, or causes to be introduced, a computer contaminant into any computer, computer program, or computer network which results in a loss of property or computer services.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">'''Logic built-in self-test''' (or '''LBIST''') is a form of [[built-in self-test]] (BIST) in which hardware and/or software is built into [[integrated circuit]]s allowing them to test their own operation, as opposed to reliance on external [[Automatic test equipment|automated test equipment]].

==Advantages==
The main advantage of LBIST is the ability to test internal circuits having no direct connections to external pins, and thus unreachable by external automated test equipment.  Another advantage is the ability to trigger the LBIST of an integrated circuit while running a built-in self test or power-on self test of the finished product. More security will provide when compared to DES technique. It can handle the data size up to 128, 192 and 256 bits. Hackers cannot hack the data even if key and algorithm are known.

==Disadvantages==
LBIST that requires additional circuitry (or [[read-only memory]]) increases the cost of the integrated circuit. LBIST that only requires temporary changes to [[Programmable logic device|programmable logic]] or [[Flash memory|rewritable memory]] avoids this extra cost, but requires more time to first program in the BIST and then to remove it and program in the final configuration. Another disadvantage of LBIST is the possibility that the on-chip testing hardware itself can fail; external automated test equipment tests the integrated circuit with known-good test circuitry.

==Related technologies==
Other, related technologies are [[PBIST|MBIST]] (a BIST optimized for testing internal [[memory]]) and ABIST (either a BIST optimized for testing [[Array data structure|arrays]] or a BIST that is optimized for testing [[Analogue electronics|analog circuitry]]).  The two uses may be distinguished by considering whether the integrated circuit being tested has an internal array or analog functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2521">'''Megasonic cleaning''' is a type of [[acoustic cleaning]], related to [[ultrasonic cleaning]]. It is a gentler cleaning mechanism, less likely to cause damage, and is used in wafer, medical implant, and industrial part cleaning.

Similar to ultrasonic cleaning, megasonics utilizes a [[transducer]] that usually sits atop a [[piezoelectric]] substrate. The transducer creates an acoustic field at a much higher frequency (typically 0.8–2&amp;nbsp;MHz) compared to ultrasonic cleaning (20-200&amp;nbsp;kHz). As a result, the [[cavitation]] that occurs is gentler and on a much smaller scale. Megasonics are currently used mainly in the electronics industry for preparation of silicon wafers. &lt;ref name=K11&gt;Barbara Kanegsberg, Edward Kanegsberg (ed), ''Handbook for Critical Cleaning: Cleaning Agents and Systems, Second Edition'',CRC Press, 2011, {{ISBN|1439828288}} pp.245-247 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Megasonics cleaning compared to ultrasonic cleaning==

The difference between ultrasonic cleaning and megasonics cleaning lies in the frequency that is used to generate the acoustic waves. Ultrasonic cleaning uses lower frequencies; it produces random cavitation. Megasonics cleaning uses higher frequencies; it produces controlled cavitation.

An important distinction between the two methods is that the cavitation effects in a megasonic bath are much less damaging than those found with ultrasonic frequencies. This significantly reduces or eliminates cavitation erosion and the likelihood of surface damage to the product being cleaned. Parts that would be damaged by ultrasonic frequencies or cavitation effects can often be cleaned without damage in a megasonic bath using the same solution.

With ultrasonics, cavitation occurs throughout the tank, and all sides of submerged parts are cleaned. With megasonics, the acoustic wave is found only in a line of sight from the transducer surface. For this reason megasonic transducers are typically built using arrays of square or rectangular piezo devices bonded to a substrate and spaced as close together as possible. Semiconductor wafers are typically cleaned in carriers holding the substrates perpendicular to the transducer so that both front and back surfaces can be cleaned. Special carriers are sometimes used to reduce any obstructions that may prevent parts of the wafer surface from being cleaned. &lt;ref name=K11/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=July 2008}}
'''Methods engineering''' is a subspecialty of [[industrial engineering]] and [[manufacturing engineering]] concerned with human integration in industrial production processes.&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;Methods Engineering [https://archive.org/details/MethodsEngineering Reference book]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Alternatively it can be described as the design of the productive process in which a person is involved. The task of the Methods engineer is to decide where humans will be utilized in the process of converting [[raw material]]s to finished products and how workers can most effectively perform their assigned tasks.&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Work Design &amp; Measurement, IE Terminology, 2000 Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt; The terms operation analysis, work design and simplification, and methods engineering and corporate re-engineering are frequently used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Niebel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Freivalds |first=Andris |first2=Benjamin |last2=Niebel |title=Methods, Standards, and Work Design |edition=Eleventh |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0072468246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowering costs and increasing reliability and productivity are the objectives of methods engineering. These objectives are met in a five step sequence as follows: Project selection,  data acquisition and presentation, data analysis, development of an ideal method based on the data analysis and, finally, presentation and implementation of the method.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt;

== Methods engineering topics ==

=== Project selection ===
Methods engineers typically work on projects involving new product design, products with a high cost of production to profit ratio, and products associated with having poor quality issues. Different methods of project selection include the [[Pareto analysis]], fish diagrams, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT chart]]s, and job/work site analysis guides.

=== Data acquisition and presentation ===
Data that needs to be collected are specification sheets for the product, design drawings, quantity and delivery requirements, and projections as to how the product will perform or has performed in the market. The Gantt process chart can assist in the analysis of the man to machine interaction and it can aid in establishing the optimum number of workers and machines subject to the financial constraints of the operation. A flow diagram is frequently employed to represent the manufacturing process associated with the product.

=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis enables the methods engineer to make decisions about several things, including: purpose of the operation, part design characteristics, specifications and tolerances of parts, materials, manufacturing process design, setup and tooling, working conditions, material handling, plant layout, and workplace design.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt; Knowing the specifics (who, what, when, where, why, and how) of product manufacturing assists in the development of an optimum manufacturing method.

=== Ideal method development ===
Equations of synchronous and random servicing as well as line balancing are used to determine the ideal worker to machine ratio for the process or product chosen. Synchronous servicing is defined as the process where a machine is assigned to more than one operator, and the assigned operators and machine are occupied during the whole operating cycle. Random servicing of a facility, as the name indicates, is defined as a servicing process with a random time of occurrence and need of servicing variables. Line balancing equations determine the ideal number of workers needed on a production line to enable it to work at capacity.

=== Presentation and methods implementation ===
The industrial process or operation can be optimized using a variety of available methods. Each method design has its advantages and disadvantages. The best overall method is chosen using selection criteria and concepts involving [[value engineering]], [[cost-benefit analysis]], crossover charts, and economic analysis. The outcome of the selection process is then presented to the company for implementation at the plant. This last step involves "selling the idea" to the company brass, a skill the methods engineer must develop in addition to the normal engineering qualifications.

[[File:V-2 lift-off.jpg|thumb|A [[V-2 rocket]] launch by the [[United Kingdom|British]] during [[Operation Backfire (WWII)|Operation Backfire]] ]]

In modern language, a '''missile''', also known as a guided missile, is a guided self-propelled  system, as opposed to an unguided self-propelled munition, referred to as a [[rocket (weapon)|rocket]] (although these too can also be [[Direct Attack Guided Rocket|guided]]). Missiles have four system components: targeting or [[missile guidance]], flight system, engine, and [[warhead]]. Missiles come in types adapted for different purposes: [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface-to-surface]] and [[air-to-surface missile]]s ([[Ballistic missile|ballistic]], [[Cruise missile|cruise]], [[Anti-ship missile|anti-ship]], [[Anti-tank missile|anti-tank]], etc.), [[surface-to-air missile]]s (and [[Anti-ballistic missile|anti-ballistic]]), [[air-to-air missile]]s, and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s. All known existing missiles are designed to be propelled during powered flight by chemical reactions inside a [[rocket engine]], [[jet engine]], or other type of engine.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Non-self-propelled airborne [[explosive device]]s are generally referred to as [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] and usually have a shorter range than missiles.

In ordinary British-English usage predating guided weapons, a missile is  such as objects thrown at players by rowdy spectators at a sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/nov/21/emmanuel-eboue-galatasaray-besiktas Guardian newspaper: "Emmanuel Eboué pelted with missiles while playing for Galatasaray"] Example of ordinary English usage. In this case the missiles were bottles and cigarette lighters&lt;/ref&gt;

The first missiles to be used operationally were a series of [[List of World War II guided missiles of Germany|missiles]] developed by [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Most famous of these are the [[V-1 flying bomb]] and [[V-2 rocket]], both of which used a simple mechanical [[autopilot]] to keep the missile flying along a pre-chosen route. Less well known were a series of anti-shipping and anti-aircraft missiles, typically based on a simple [[radio control]] ([[command guidance]]) system directed by the operator. However, these early systems in World War&amp;nbsp;II were only built in small numbers.

Guided missiles have a number of different system components:
* Targeting or [[missile guidance]]
* Flight system
* [[engine (propulsion)|Engine]]
* [[Warhead]]

===Guidance systems===
[[File:Missile Maintainer inspects missile guidance system of the LGM-30G Minuteman ICBM.jpg|thumb|Missile Maintainer inspects missile guidance system of the [[LGM-30G Minuteman]] ICBM]]
The most common method of guidance is to use some form of [[radiation]], such as [[infrared homing|infrared]], [[laser guidance|laser]]s or [[radar guidance|radio wave]]s, to guide the missile onto its target. This radiation may emanate from the target (such as the heat of an engine or the radio waves from an enemy radar), it may be provided by the missile itself (such as a radar), or it may be provided by a friendly third party (such as the radar of the launch vehicle/platform, or a laser designator operated by friendly [[infantry]]). The first two are often known as [[fire-and-forget]] as they need no further support or control from the launch vehicle/platform in order to function. Another method is to use a [[TV guidance]], with a [[visible light]] or infrared picture produced in order to see the target. The picture may be used either by a human operator who steering the missile onto its target or by a computer doing much the same job. One of the more bizarre guidance methods instead used a [[Project Pigeon|pigeon to steer a missile]] to its target. Some missiles also have a home-on-jam capability to guide itself to a radar-emitting source. Many missiles use a combination of two or more of the methods to improve accuracy and the chances of a successful engagement.

===Targeting systems===
Another method is to target the missile by knowing the location of the target and using a guidance system such as [[Inertial navigation system|INS]], [[TERCOM]] or [[satellite guidance]]. This guidance system guides the missile by knowing the missile's current position and the position of the target, and then calculating a course between them. This job can also be performed somewhat crudely by a human operator who can see the target and the missile and guide it using either cable- or [[radio-control|radio]]-based remote control, or by an [[ACLOS|automatic system]] that can simultaneously track the target and the missile.
Furthermore, some missiles use initial targeting, sending them to a target area, where they will switch to primary targeting, using either radar or IR targeting to acquire the target.

===Flight system===
Whether a guided missile uses a targeting system, a guidance system or both, it needs a flight system. The flight system uses the data from the targeting or guidance system to maneuver the missile in flight, allowing it to counter inaccuracies in the missile or to follow a moving target. There are two main systems: vectored thrust (for missiles that are powered throughout the guidance phase of their flight) and aerodynamic maneuvering (wings, fins, [[canard (aeronautics)]], etc.).

===Engine===
[[File:Solid-Fuel Rocket Diagram.svg|thumb|A simplified diagram of a solid-fuel rocket.&lt;br&gt;
1. A solid [[Rocket_propellant#Solid_propellants|fuel-oxidizer mixture]] (propellant) is packed into the rocket, with a cylindrical hole in the middle.&lt;br&gt;
2. An [[Pyrotechnic initiator|igniter]] combusts the surface of the propellant.&lt;br&gt;
3. The cylindrical hole in the propellant acts as a [[combustion chamber]].&lt;br&gt;
4. The hot exhaust is choked at the throat, which, among other things, dictates the amount of thrust produced.&lt;br&gt;
5. Exhaust exits the rocket.]]
Missiles are powered by an engine, generally either a type of [[rocket engine]] or [[jet engine]]. Rockets are generally of the [[solid-propellant rocket|solid propellant]] type for ease of maintenance and fast deployment, although some larger ballistic missiles use [[liquid-propellant rocket]]s. Jet engines are generally used in [[cruise missile]]s, most commonly of the [[turbojet]] type, due to its relative simplicity and low frontal area. [[Turbofan]]s and [[ramjet]]s are the only other common forms of jet engine propulsion, although any type of engine could theoretically be used. Long-range missiles may have multiple engine stages, particularly in those launched from the surface. These stages may all be of similar types or may include a mix of engine types − for example, surface-launched cruise missiles often have a rocket booster for launching and a jet engine for sustained flight.

Some missiles may have additional propulsion from another source at launch; for example, the [[V1 flying bomb|V1]] was launched by a catapult, and the [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] was fired out of a tank gun (using a smaller charge than would be used for a shell).

===Warhead===
Missiles generally have one or more [[explosive]] [[warhead]]s, although other weapon types may also be used. The warheads of a missile provide its primary destructive power (many missiles have extensive secondary destructive power due to the high kinetic energy of the weapon and unburnt fuel that may be on board). Warheads are most commonly of the [[high explosive]] type, often employing [[shaped charge]]s to exploit the accuracy of a guided weapon to destroy hardened targets. Other warhead types include [[submunition]]s, [[incendiary device|incendiaries]], [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[chemical weapon|chemical]], [[biological weapon|biological]] or [[radiological weapon]]s or [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s.
Warheadless missiles are often used for testing and training purposes.

==Basic roles==
{{see also|List of missiles}}
Missiles are generally categorized by their launch platform and intended target. In broadest terms, these will either be surface (ground or water) or air, and then sub-categorized by range and the exact target type (such as anti-tank or anti-ship). Many weapons are designed to be launched from both surface or the air, and a few are designed to attack either surface or air targets (such as the [[Air Defense Anti-Tank System|ADATS]] missile). Most weapons require some modification in order to be launched from the air or surface, such as adding [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] to the surface-launched version.

===Ballistic===
[[File:Dnepr rocket lift-off 1.jpg|thumb|upright|An [[R-36 (missile)|R-36]] ballistic missile launch at a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] silo]]After the boost stage, ballistic missiles follow a [[trajectory]] mainly determined by [[ballistics]]. The guidance is for relatively small deviations from that.

Ballistic missiles are largely used for land attack missions. Although normally associated with nuclear weapons, some conventionally armed ballistic missiles are in service, such as [[MGM-140 ATACMS]]. The V2 had demonstrated that a ballistic missile could deliver a warhead to a target city with no possibility of interception, and the introduction of [[nuclear weapon]]s meant it could efficiently do damage when it arrived. The accuracy of these systems was fairly poor, but post-war development by most military forces improved the basic [[Inertial navigation system]] concept to the point where it could be used as the guidance system on [[Intercontinental ballistic missile]]s flying thousands of kilometers. Today, the ballistic missile represents the only [[Deterrence theory|strategic deterrent]] in most military forces; however, some ballistic missiles are being adapted for conventional roles, such as the Russian [[9K720 Iskander|Iskander]] or the Chinese [[DF-21#DF-21D|DF-21D]] [[anti-ship ballistic missile]]. Ballistic missiles are primarily surface-launched from [[transporter erector launcher|mobile launchers]], [[missile silo|silos]], [[warship|ships]] or [[ballistic missile submarine|submarines]], with [[ALBM|air launch]] being theoretically possible with a weapon such as the cancelled [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] missile.

The [[Russia]]n [[RT-2PM2 Topol-M|Topol M (SS-27 Sickle B)]] is the fastest (7,320&amp;nbsp;m/s) missile currently in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = World’s military powers | publisher = The Independent | url = http://www.independent.co.ug/index.php/reports/world-report/74-world-report-/172-worlds-military-powers | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100530062700/http://www.independent.co.ug/index.php/reports/world-report/74-world-report-/172-worlds-military-powers | archivedate = 2010-05-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruise missile====
[[File:Tomahawk Block IV cruise missile.jpg|thumb|United States [[Tomahawk cruise missile]]]]
[[File:BrahMos.jpg|thumb|Indian Supersonic cruise missile [[BrahMos]].]]The [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] had been successfully intercepted during [[World War II]], but this did not make the [[cruise missile]] concept entirely useless. After the war, the US deployed a small number of nuclear-armed cruise missiles in Germany, but these were considered to be of limited usefulness. Continued research into much longer-ranged and faster versions led to the US's [[SM-64 Navaho]] and its [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] counterparts, the [[Burya]] and [[Buran cruise missile]]. However, these were rendered largely obsolete by the [[ICBM]], and none were used operationally. Shorter-range developments have become widely used as highly accurate attack systems, such as the US [[Tomahawk missile]] and Russian [[Kh-55]] . Cruise missiles are generally further divided into subsonic or supersonic weapons - supersonic weapons such as [[BrahMos]] are difficult to shoot down, whereas subsonic weapons tend to be much lighter and cheaper allowing more to be fired.

Cruise missiles are generally associated with [[land-attack missile |land-attack operations]], but also have an important role as anti-shipping weapons. They are primarily launched from air, sea or submarine platforms in both roles, although land-based launchers also exist.

====Anti-ship====
[[File:Exocet-mil.jpg|thumb|The [[France|French]] [[Exocet]] missile in flight]]Another major German missile development project was the anti-shipping class (such as the [[Fritz X]] and [[Henschel Hs 293]]), intended to stop any attempt at a cross-channel invasion. However, the British were able to render their systems useless by jamming their radios, and missiles with [[wire guided missile|wire guidance]] were not ready by [[D-Day]]. After the war, the anti-shipping class slowly developed and became a major class in the 1960s with the introduction of the low-flying jet- or rocket-powered cruise missiles known as "sea-skimmers". These became famous during the [[Falklands War]], when an Argentine [[Exocet|Exocet missile]] sank a [[Royal Navy]] destroyer.

A number of [[anti-submarine missile]]s also exist; these generally use the missile in order to deliver another weapon system such as a [[torpedo]] or [[depth charge]] to the location of the submarine, at which point the other weapon will conduct the underwater phase of the mission.

====Anti-tank====
[[File:Army-fgm148.jpg|thumb|[[U.S. Army]] soldiers firing an [[FGM-148 Javelin]]]]By the end of WWII, all forces had widely introduced unguided rockets using [[High-explosive anti-tank warhead]]s as their major anti-tank weapon (see [[Panzerfaust]], [[Bazooka]]). However, these had a limited useful range of 100 m or so, and the Germans were looking to extend this with the use of a missile using [[wire-guided missile|wire guidance]], the X-7. After the war, this became a major design class in the later 1950s and, by the 1960s, had developed into practically the only non-tank anti-tank system in general use. During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] between Israel and Egypt, the [[9M14 Malyutka]] (aka "Sagger") man-portable anti-tank missile proved potent against Israeli tanks. While other guidance systems have been tried, the basic reliability of wire guidance means this will remain the primary means of controlling anti-tank missiles in the near future. Anti-tank missiles may be launched from aircraft, vehicles or by ground troops in the case of smaller weapons.

===Surface-to-air and subsurface-to-air===

====Anti-aircraft====
[[File:Patriot missile launch b.jpg|thumb|upright|[[MIM-104 Patriot]] missile being launched]]By 1944, US and British air forces were sending huge air fleets over occupied Europe, increasing the pressure on the [[Luftwaffe]] day and night fighter forces. The Germans were keen to get some sort of useful ground-based anti-aircraft system into operation. Several systems were under development, but none had reached operational status before the war's end. The [[United States Navy|US Navy]] also started missile research to deal with the [[Kamikaze]] threat. By 1950, systems based on this early research started to reach operational service, including the [[United States Army|US Army]]'s [[MIM-3 Nike Ajax]] and the Navy's "3T's" (Talos, Terrier, Tartar), soon followed by the Soviet [[S-25 Berkut]] and [[S-75 Dvina]] and French and British systems. Anti-aircraft weapons exist for virtually every possible launch platform, with surface-launched systems ranging from huge, self-propelled or ship-mounted launchers to man-portable systems. '''Subsurface-to-air missiles''' are usually launched from below water (usually from [[submarine]]s).

====Anti-ballistic====
[[File:Arrow anti-ballistic missile launch.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]]]]
Like most missiles, the [[S-300 (missile)|S-300]], [[S-400 (missile)]], [[Advanced Air Defence]] and [[MIM-104 Patriot]] are for defense against short-range missiles and carry explosive warheads.

However, in the case of a large closing speed, [[Projectile#Explosive charge or kinetic|a projectile without explosives]] is used; just a [[collision]] is sufficient to destroy the target. See [[Missile Defense Agency]] for the following systems being developed:

* [[Arrow 3]]
* [[Kinetic Energy Interceptor]] (KEI)
* [[Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System]] (Aegis BMD) - an [[RIM-161 Standard missile 3|SM-3]] missile with a Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP) Kinetic Warhead (KW)

===Air-to-air===
[[File:Aircraft Combat Archer (2565196807).jpg|thumb|A [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]] fires an [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]]]

Soviet [[RS-82 (rocket family)|RS-82 rocket]]s were successfully tested in combat at the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]] in 1939.

German experience in World War&amp;nbsp;II demonstrated that destroying a large aircraft was quite difficult, and they had invested considerable effort into [[air-to-air missile]] systems to do this. Their [[Messerschmitt Me 262]]'s jets often carried R4M rockets, and other types of "bomber destroyer" aircraft had unguided rockets as well. In the post-war period, the R4M served as the pattern for a number of similar systems, used by almost all interceptor aircraft during the 1940s and 1950s. Most rockets (except for the [[AIR-2 Genie]], due to its nuclear warhead with a large blast radius) had to be carefully aimed at relatively close range to hit the target successfully. The [[United States Navy]] and [[U.S. Air Force]] began deploying guided missiles in the early 1950s, most famous being the US Navy's [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and the USAF's [[AIM-4 Falcon]]. These systems have continued to advance, and modern air warfare consists almost entirely of missile firing. In the [[Falklands War]], less powerful British [[Harrier Jump Jet|Harriers]] were able to defeat faster Argentinian opponents using AIM-9L missiles provided by the United States as the conflict began. The latest heat-seeking designs can lock onto a target from various angles, not just from behind, where the heat signature from the engines is strongest. Other types rely on radar guidance (either on board or "painted" by the launching aircraft). Air-to-air missiles also have a wide range of sizes, ranging from helicopter-launched self-defense weapons with a range of a few kilometers, to long-range weapons designed for interceptor aircraft such as the [[R-37 (missile)]].

===Anti-satellite===
[[File:ASAT missile launch.jpg|thumb|upright|[[ASM-135 ASAT]] missile launch in 1985]]In the 1950s and 1960s, Soviet designers started work on an anti-satellite weapon, called the [[Istrebitel Sputnik]], which literally means "interceptor of satellites" or "destroyer of satellites". After a lengthy development process of roughly twenty years, it was finally decided that testing of the Istrebitel Sputnik be canceled. This was when the United States started testing their own systems. The [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Brilliant Pebbles]] defense system proposed during the 1980s would have used kinetic energy collisions without explosives. Anti-satellite weapons may be launched either by an aircraft or a surface platform, depending on the design. To date, only a few known tests have occurred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2458">The '''Mobile Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Content''' was founded in 2008 by an international group of mobile operators within the GSM Association &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsmworld.com/news/press_2008/press08_09.shtml GSMA Press Release 2008 - GSMA Selects LG Handsets to Lead ‘Horizon Phone’ Campaign&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to work collectively on obstructing the use of the mobile environment by individuals or organisations wishing to consume or profit from child sexual abuse content.

While the vast majority of child sexual abuse content ([[child pornography]]) is today accessed through conventional connections to the Internet, there is a danger that broadband networks now being rolled out by mobile operators could be misused in the same way.

==Goal of the Alliance==
The Alliance’s ultimate aim is to help stem, and ultimately reverse, the growth of non approved content around the world. Through a combination of technical measures, co-operation and information sharing, the Alliance seeks to create significant barriers to the misuse of mobile networks and services for hosting, accessing, or profiting from not approved content.

==Member commitments==
Members of the Alliance agree to, among other measures:
·	support and promote ‘hotlines’ or other mechanisms for customers to report child sexual abuse content discovered on the Internet or on mobile content services.
·	implement [[notice and take down]] processes to enable the removal of any child sexual abuse content posted on their own services
·	implement technical mechanisms to prevent access to websites identified by an appropriate agency as hosting child sexual abuse content

The Alliance encourages all mobile operators worldwide, regardless of access technology, to participate in the Alliance.

==Founding members==
The founding members of the Mobile Alliance were:
*[[GSMA]]
*Hutchison 3G Europe
*[[mobilkom austria]]
*Orange FT Group
*[[Telecom Italia]]
*Telefónica/02
*[[Telenor]] Group

'''Nanosensors''' is a brand of [[AFM probe|SPM and AFM probes]] for [[atomic force microscopy]] (AFM) and [[scanning probe microscopy]] (SPM).

== History ==
Basic research at [[IBM]] led to the development of the basic technologies necessary for batch processing of silicon  SPM and AFM probes using [[bulk micromachining]].

In 1993 under the brand name Nanosensors they became the first commercialized  [[AFM probe|SPM and AFM probes]] worldwide. The development and introduction of batch processing to producing [[AFM probe]]s was a crucial step to the introduction of the [[Atomic Force Microscope]] into the high tech industry. In recognition of this achievement, Nanosensors has been discerned the Dr.-Rudolf-Eberle Innovation Award of the German State of [[Baden-Württemberg]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patente-stuttgart.de/index_ipbw.php?page=auszeichnungen&amp;jahr=1995 Dr.-Rudolf-Eberle-Preis – Innovationspreis des Landes Baden Württemberg, Auszeichungen, Preisträger 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995, the Innovation Prize of the German Industry &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.innovationspreis.com/index.php?select=inno&amp;look=preistraegervorj Innovationspreis der deutschen Wirtschaft, Erster Innovationspreis der Welt, Preisträger der Vorjahre, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 as well as the Innovation Award of the Förderkreis für die Mikroelektronik e.V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foerderkreis-mikroelektronik.de/ Annual Innovation Award of the Förderkreis Mikroelektronik, Industrie- und Handelskammer Nürnberg für Mittelfranken]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1999.

In 2002, Nanosensors was acquired by and integrated into Switzerland-based [[NanoWorld]]. It continues as an independent business unit.

== Significance ==
Researchers have developed a [[Scanning probe microscopy#Established types of scanning probe microscopy|large array of operating modes and methods]] for [[Scanning probe microscopy]] and [[Atomic Force Microscopy]]. Independently of the method, their use and application requires essentially a versatile [[Scanning probe microscope|SPM-]] or [[Atomic Force Microscope|AFM]]-instrument which must be equipped with a method-specific [[AFM probe|SPM or AFM probe]].

As Nanosensors supplies [[Scanning probe microscope|SPM-]] or [[Atomic Force Microscope|AFM]]-users worldwide with the broadest choice of [[AFM probe|SPM or AFM probes]], some therefore consider this company a "giant" of this industry.&lt;ref name="doi10.1016/S1369-70210970276-7"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stevens | first1 = R.

Nanosenors is frequently cited as the supplier of the [[AFM probe|SPM or AFM probes]] in [[nanotechnology]] research papers (see below) – reflecting its market position and that often it is the only commercial source for these products worldwide.

=== AFM Probe Series ===

==== PointProbePlus ====
The PointProbePlus series is directly based on the technology originally developed and commercialized by Nanosensors in 1993. The original PointProbe technology has been upgraded to the PointProbePlus technology in 2004 yielding a reduced variation of tip shape and increased reproducibility of images. It is manufactured from highly doped [[monocrystalline silicon]]. The tip is pointing into the &lt;100&gt; crystal direction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63967">'''OBD-II PIDs''' ([[On-board diagnostics]] '''Parameter IDs''') are codes used to request data from a vehicle, used as a diagnostic tool.

[[SAE International|SAE]] standard J1979 defines many OBD-II PIDs. All on-road vehicles and trucks sold in North America are required to support a subset of these codes, primarily for state mandated [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] [[vehicle inspection|inspections]]. Manufacturers also define additional PIDs specific to their vehicles. Though not mandated, many motorcycles also support OBD-II PIDs.

In 1996, light duty vehicles (less than {{convert|8500|lbs|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) were the first to be mandated followed by medium duty vehicles (between {{convert|8500|–|14000|lbs|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) in 2005.&lt;ref name=epa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/obd/basic.htm |title=Basic Information {{!}} On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) |publisher=US EPA |date=16 March 2015 |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both required to be accessed through a standardized [[Data link connector (automotive)|data link connector]] defined by [[SAE J1962]].

Heavy duty vehicles (greater than {{convert|14000|lbs||abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}) made after 2010,&lt;ref name=epa /&gt; for sale in the US are allowed to support OBD-II diagnostics through [[SAE J1939|SAE standard J1939-73]] (a round diagnostic connector) according to CARB in title 13 CCR 1971.1.  Some heavy duty trucks in North America use the SAE J1962 OBD-II diagnostic connector that is common with passenger cars, notably Mack and Volvo Trucks, however they use 29 bit CAN identifiers (unlike 11 bit headers used by passenger cars).

== Services ==
There are 10 diagnostic services described in the latest OBD-II standard SAE J1979. Before 2002, J1979 referred to these services as "modes". They are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! Service (hex) !! Description
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 01|&lt;tt&gt;01&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Show current data 
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 02|&lt;tt&gt;02&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Show freeze frame data
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 03|&lt;tt&gt;03&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Show stored Diagnostic Trouble Codes
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 04|&lt;tt&gt;04&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes and stored values
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 05|&lt;tt&gt;05&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Test results, oxygen sensor monitoring (non CAN only)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;06&lt;/tt&gt; || Test results, other component/system monitoring (Test results, oxygen sensor monitoring for CAN only)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;07&lt;/tt&gt; || Show pending Diagnostic Trouble Codes (detected during current or last driving cycle)
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;08&lt;/tt&gt; || Control operation of on-board component/system
|-
| align="center" | [[#Service 09|&lt;tt&gt;09&lt;/tt&gt;]] || Request vehicle information
|-
| align="center" | &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;/tt&gt; || Permanent [[Diagnostic Trouble Code]]s (DTCs) (Cleared DTCs)
|}

Vehicle manufacturers are not required to support all services. Each manufacturer may define additional services above #9 (e.g.: service 22 as defined by SAE J2190 for Ford/GM, service 21 for Toyota) for other information e.g. the voltage of the traction battery in a [[hybrid electric vehicle]] (HEV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Escape PHEV TechInfo - PIDs|url=http://www.eaa-phev.org/wiki/Escape_PHEV_TechInfo#PIDs|work=Electric Auto Association - Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standard PIDs ==
The table below shows the standard OBD-II PIDs as defined by SAE J1979. The expected response for each PID is given, along with information on how to translate the response into meaningful data. Again, not all vehicles will support all PIDs and there can be manufacturer-defined custom PIDs that are not defined in the OBD-II standard.

Note that services 01 and 02 are basically identical, except that service 01 provides current information, whereas service 02 provides a snapshot of the same data taken at the point when the last diagnostic trouble code was set. The exceptions are PID 01, which is only available in service 01, and PID 02, which is only available in service 02. If service 02 PID 02 returns zero, then there is no snapshot and all other service 02 data is meaningless.

When using Bit-Encoded-Notation, quantities like C4 means bit 4 from data byte C. Each bit is numerated from 0 to 7, so 7 is the most significant bit and 0 is the least significant bit.

=== Bitwise encoded PIDs ===
Some of the PIDs in the above table cannot be explained with a simple formula.  A more elaborate explanation of these data is provided here:

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;00&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data. Each bit, from [[Most significant bit|MSB]] to [[Least significant bit|LSB]], represents one of the next 32 PIDs and specifies whether that PID is supported.

For example, if the car response is &lt;tt&gt;BE1FA813&lt;/tt&gt;, it can be decoded like this:

{| class="wikitable"
|- align="center"
! scope="col" | Hexadecimal
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt;
| colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || colspan="4" | &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;
|- align="center"

| &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;

| &lt;tt&gt;09&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0A&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0B&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0E&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;0F&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;11&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;13&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;14&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;15&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;16&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;17&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;18&lt;/tt&gt;
| &lt;tt&gt;19&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1A&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1B&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1C&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1D&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1E&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;1F&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

So, supported PIDs are: &lt;tt&gt;01&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;03&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;04&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;05&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;06&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;07&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0C&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0D&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0E&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;0F&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;11&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;13&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;15&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;1C&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;1F&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;20&lt;/tt&gt;

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;01&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data, labeled A B C and D.

The first byte(A) contains two pieces of information. Bit &lt;tt&gt;A7&lt;/tt&gt; ([[Most significant bit|MSB]] of byte A, the first byte) indicates whether or not the MIL (check engine light) is illuminated.  Bits &lt;tt&gt;A6&lt;/tt&gt; through &lt;tt&gt;A0&lt;/tt&gt; represent the number of diagnostic trouble codes currently flagged in the ECU.

The second, third, and fourth bytes(B, C and D) give information about the availability and completeness of certain on-board tests.  Note that test '''availability''' is indicated by set (&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;) bit and '''completeness''' is indicated by reset (&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;) bit.

{| class="wikitable"
! Bit
! Name
! Definition
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;A7&lt;/tt&gt;
| MIL
| Off or On, indicates if the CEL/MIL is on (or should be on)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;A6&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A0&lt;/tt&gt;
| DTC_CNT
| Number of confirmed emissions-related DTCs available for display.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;B7&lt;/tt&gt;
| RESERVED
| Reserved (should be &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;)
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;B3&lt;/tt&gt;
| ''NO NAME''
| &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; = Spark ignition monitors supported (e.g. Otto or Wankel engines)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; = Compression ignition monitors supported (e.g. Diesel engines)
|}

Here are the common bit B definitions, they are test based.

{| class="wikitable"
! !! Test available !! Test incomplete
|- align="center"
! scope="row" | Components
| &lt;tt&gt;B2&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;B6&lt;/tt&gt;

|- align="center"
! scope="row" | Misfire
| &lt;tt&gt;B0&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;tt&gt;B4&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The third and fourth bytes are to be interpreted differently depending on if the engine is [[spark plug|spark]] [[ignition system|ignition]] (e.g. Otto or Wankel engines) or [[Diesel engine|compression ignition]] (e.g. Diesel engines). In the second (B) byte, bit 3 indicates how to interpret the C and D bytes, with &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; being spark (Otto or Wankel) and &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; (set) being compression (Diesel).

The bytes C and D for spark ignition monitors (e.g. Otto or Wankel engines):

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;41&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data. 
The first byte is always zero. The second, third, and fourth bytes give information about the availability and completeness of certain on-board tests. As with PID 01, the third and fourth bytes are to be interpreted differently depending on the ignition type (B3) – with &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt; being spark and &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt; (set) being compression. Note again that test '''availability''' is represented by a set (&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;) bit and '''completeness''' is represented by a reset (&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;) bit.

Here are the common bit B definitions, they are test based.

|}

The remaining bytes are 16 bit integers indicating the temperature in degrees Celsius in the range -40 to 6513.5 (scale 0.1), using the usual &lt;math&gt;(A \times 256 + B) / 10 - 40&lt;/math&gt; formula (MSB is A, LSB is B). Only values for which the corresponding sensor is supported are meaningful.

The same structure applies to PID &lt;tt&gt;79&lt;/tt&gt;, but values are for sensors of bank 2.

==== Service 03 (no PID required) ====
A request for this service returns a list of the DTCs that have been set. The list is encapsulated using the [[ISO 15765-2]] protocol.

If there are two or fewer DTCs (4 bytes) they are returned in an ISO-TP Single Frame (SF).  Three or more DTCs in the list are reported in multiple frames, with the exact count of frames dependent on the communication type and addressing details.

Each trouble code requires 2 bytes to describe.  The text description of a trouble code may be decoded as follows.  The first character in the trouble code is determined by the first two bits in the first byte:

{| class="wikitable"
! &lt;tt&gt;A7&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A6&lt;/tt&gt; !! First DTC character
|-
| align="center" | 00 || &lt;tt&gt;'''P'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Powertrain
|-
| align="center" | 01 || &lt;tt&gt;'''C'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Chassis
|-
| align="center" | 10 || &lt;tt&gt;'''B'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Body
|-
| align="center" | 11 || &lt;tt&gt;'''U'''&lt;/tt&gt; - Network
|}

The two following digits are encoded as 2 bits. The second character in the DTC is a number defined by the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
! &lt;tt&gt;A5&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A4&lt;/tt&gt; !! Second DTC character
|-
| align="center" | 00 || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 01 || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 10 || &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 11 || &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The third character in the DTC is a number defined by

{| class="wikitable"
! &lt;tt&gt;A3&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;A0&lt;/tt&gt; !! Third DTC character
|-
| align="center" | 0000 || &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 0001 || &lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 0010 || &lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 0011 || &lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 0100 || &lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 0101 || &lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 0110 || &lt;tt&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 0111 || &lt;tt&gt;7&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1000 || &lt;tt&gt;8&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1001 || &lt;tt&gt;9&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1010 || &lt;tt&gt;A&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1011 || &lt;tt&gt;B&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1100 || &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1101 || &lt;tt&gt;D&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1110 || &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt;
|-
| align="center" | 1111 || &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;
|}

The fourth and fifth characters are defined in the same way as the third, but using bits &lt;tt&gt;B7&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;B4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;B3&lt;/tt&gt;-&lt;tt&gt;B0&lt;/tt&gt;. The resulting five-character code should look something like "&lt;tt&gt;U0158&lt;/tt&gt;" and can be looked up in a table of OBD-II DTCs. Hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F), while relatively rare, are allowed in the last 3 positions of the code itself.

==== Service 09 PID 08 ====

It provides information about track in-use performance for catalyst banks, oxygen sensor banks, evaporative leak detection systems, EGR systems and secondary air system.

The numerator for each component or system tracks the number of times that all conditions necessary for a specific monitor to detect a malfunction have been encountered.
The denominator for each component or system tracks the number of times that the vehicle has been operated in the specified conditions.

The count of data items should be reported at the beginning (the first byte).

All data items of the In-use Performance Tracking record consist of two (2) bytes and are reported in this order (each message contains two items, hence the message length is 4).

=== Enumerated PIDs ===
Some PIDs are to be interpreted specially, and aren't necessarily exactly bitwise encoded, or in any scale.
The values for these PIDs are [[Enumerated type|enumerated]].

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;03&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns 2 bytes of data.
The first byte describes fuel system #1.

{| class="wikitable"
! Value !! Description
|-
| align="center" | 1 || Open loop due to insufficient engine temperature
|-
| align="center" | 2 || Closed loop, using oxygen sensor feedback to determine fuel mix
|-
| align="center" | 4 || Open loop due to engine load OR fuel cut due to deceleration
|-
| align="center" | 8 || Open loop due to system failure
|-
| align="center" | 16 || Closed loop, using at least one oxygen sensor but there is a fault in the feedback system
|}

Any other value is an invalid response.

The second byte describes fuel system #2 (if it exists) and is encoded identically to the first byte.

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns a single byte of data which describes the secondary air status.

{| class="wikitable"
! Value !! Description
|-

|-
| align="center" | 2 || Downstream of catalytic converter
|-
| align="center" | 4 || From the outside atmosphere or off

|}

Any other value is an invalid response.

==== Service 01 PID &lt;tt&gt;1C&lt;/tt&gt; ====
A request for this PID returns a single byte of data which describes which OBD standards this ECU was designed to comply with.  The different values the data byte can hold are shown below, next to what they mean:

Any other value is reserved by ISO/SAE. There are currently no definitions for [[flexible-fuel vehicle]].

== Non-standard PIDs ==
The majority of all OBD-II PIDs in use are non-standard. For most modern vehicles, there are many more functions supported on the OBD-II interface than are covered by the standard PIDs, and there is relatively minor overlap between vehicle manufacturers for these non-standard PIDs.

There is very limited information available in the public domain for non-standard PIDs. The primary source of information on non-standard PIDs across different manufacturers is maintained by the US-based [[Equipment and Tool Institute]] and only available to members. The price of ETI membership for access to scan codes varies based on company size defined by annual sales of automotive tools and equipment in North America:

{| class="wikitable"  
|-
! Annual Sales in North America !! Annual Dues
|-
| Under $10,000,000 || $5,000
|-
| $10,000,000 - $50,000,000 || $7,500
|-
| Greater than $50,000,000 || $10,000
|}
However, even ETI membership will not provide full documentation for non-standard PIDs. ETI state:&lt;ref name=eti-faq&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some OEMs refuse to use ETI as a one-stop source of scan tool information. They prefer to do business with each tool company separately. These companies also require that you enter into a contract with them. The charges vary but here is a snapshot as of April 13th, 2015 of the per year charges:
{| class="wikitable"  
|-
|GM          || $50,000
|-
|Honda       || $5,000
|-
|Suzuki      || $1,000
|-
|BMW         || $25,500 plus $2,000 per update. Updates occur annually.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== CAN (11-bit) bus format ==
The PID query and response occurs on the vehicle's CAN bus. Standard OBD requests and responses use functional addresses. The diagnostic reader initiates a query using CAN ID 7DFh{{clarify|date=May 2015}}&lt;!--what is the PID of the diagnostic reader? what is the payload 8 bytes?--&gt;, which acts as a broadcast address, and accepts responses from any ID in the range 7E8h to 7EFh. ECUs that can respond to OBD queries listen both to the functional broadcast ID of 7DFh and one assigned ID in the range 7E0h to 7E7h. Their response has an ID of their assigned ID plus 8 e.g. 7E8h through 7EFh.

This approach allows up to eight ECUs, each independently responding to OBD queries. The diagnostic reader can use the ID in the ECU response frame to continue communication with a specific ECU. In particular, multi-frame communication requires a response to the specific ECU ID rather than to ID 7DFh.

CAN bus may also be used for communication beyond the standard OBD messages. Physical addressing uses particular CAN IDs for specific modules (e.g., 720h for the instrument cluster in Fords) with proprietary frame payloads.

=== Query ===
The functional PID query is sent to the vehicle on the CAN bus at ID 7DFh, using 8 data bytes. The bytes are:
{| class="wikitable"
|- 
! 
! colspan="8" |Byte
|-
! width = 8% | PID Type
! width=22% | 0 
! width=22% | 1

| PID code&lt;br&gt;(e.g.: 05 = Engine coolant temperature)
|colspan=5| not used&lt;br&gt;(may be 55h)
|-
| Vehicle specific
| Number of&lt;br&gt;additional&lt;br&gt;data bytes:&lt;br&gt;3
| Custom service: (e.g.: 22 = enhanced data)
|colspan=2| PID code&lt;br&gt;(e.g.: 4980h)
|colspan=4| not used&lt;br&gt;(may be 00h or 55h)
|}

=== Response ===
The vehicle responds to the PID query on the CAN bus with message IDs that depend on which module responded. Typically the engine or main ECU responds at ID 7E8h. Other modules, like the hybrid controller or battery controller in a Prius, respond at 07E9h, 07EAh, 07EBh, etc. These are 8h higher than the physical address the module responds to. Even though the number of bytes in the returned value is variable, the message uses 8 data bytes regardless ([[CAN bus]] protocol form Frameformat with 8 data bytes).
The bytes are:
{| class="wikitable"

| Custom service&lt;br&gt;Same as query, except that 40h is added to the service value. So:&lt;br&gt;41h = show current data;&lt;br&gt;42h = freeze frame;&lt;br&gt;etc.

| Number of&lt;br&gt;additional&lt;br&gt;data bytes:&lt;br&gt;4to 7
| Custom service: same as query, except that 40h is added to the service value.(e.g.: 62h = response to service 22h request)
|colspan=2| PID code&lt;br&gt;(e.g.: 4980h)

|-
| Vehicle specific&lt;br&gt;7E8h, or 8h + physical ID of module.
| Number of&lt;br&gt;additional&lt;br&gt;data bytes:&lt;br&gt;3
| 7Fh this a general response usually indicating the module doesn't recognize the request.
| Custom service: (e.g.: 22h = enhanced diagnostic data by PID, 21h = enhanced data by offset)
| 31h
|colspan=4| not used&lt;br&gt;(may be 00h)

The effort came out of a redesign of Facebook's data center in [[Prineville, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/building-efficient-data-centers-with-the-open-compute-project/10150144039563920 |title= Building Efficient Data Centers with the Open Compute Project |first= Jonathan|last= Heiliger |date= April 7, 2011 |work= Facebook Engineering's notes |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After two years, with regards to a more modular server design, it was admitted that "the new design is still a long way from live data centers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Facebook Shatters the Computer Server Into Tiny Pieces |date= January 16, 2013 |first= Cade|last= Metz |work= Wired |url= https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/01/facebook-server-pieces/ |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some aspects published were used in the Prineville center to improve energy efficiency, as measured by the [[power usage effectiveness]] index defined by [[The Green Grid]].&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{Cite web |title= Facebook's Open Compute Project |work= Stanford EE Computer Systems Colloquium |date= February 15, 2012  |url= http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee380/Abstracts/120215.html |first= Amir|last= Michael |publisher= [[Stanford University]]}}  ([http://ee380.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/videologger.php?target=120215-ee380-300.asx video archive])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Open Compute Project Foundation is a [[501(c)(6)]]&lt;nowiki&gt; non-profit incorporated in the state of Delaware. Rocky Bullock serves as the Foundation's CEO. As of April 2018, there are 7 members who serve on the board of directors which is made up of one individual member and six organizational members.  Mark Roenigk (&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Facebook]]) is the Foundation's president and chairman.  [[Andy Bechtolsheim]] is the individual member.  In addition to Mark Roenigk who represents [[Facebook]], other organizations on the Open Compute board of directors include [[Intel]] (Jason Waxman), [[Goldman Sachs]] (Joshua Matheus), [[Rackspace]] (Brian Stein), and [[Microsoft]] (Bill Laing).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Organization and Board|url = http://www.opencompute.org/about/organization-and-board/|website = Open Compute|accessdate = 2015-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A current list of members can be found [http://opencompute.org/membership/membership-organizational-directory here]

Components of the Open Compute Project include:

* Server compute node designs included one for [[Intel]] processors and one for [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] processors. In 2013, [[Calxeda]] contributed a design with [[ARM architecture]] processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ARM Server Motherboard Design for Open Vault Chassis Hardware v0.3 MB-draco-hesperides-0.3 |first= Tom|last= Schnell |date= January 16, 2013 |url=http://www.opencompute.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Open_Compute_Project_ARM_Server_Specification_v0.3.pdf  |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several generations of server designs have been deployed: Freedom (Intel), Spitfire (AMD), Windmill (Intel E5-2600), Watermark (AMD), Winterfell (Intel E5-2600 v2) and Leopard (Intel E5-2600 v3)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Guide to Facebook’s Open Source Data Center Hardware|author=Data Center Knowledge|date=April 28, 2016|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/04/28/guide-to-facebooks-open-source-data-center-hardware/|accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Facebook rolls out new web and database server designs|first=The|last=Register|date=January 17, 2013|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/01/17/open_compute_facebook_servers/|accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Open Vault storage building blocks offer high disk densities, with 30 drives in a 2U [[Open Rack]] chassis designed for easy [[disk drive]] replacement. The 3.5 inch disks are stored in two drawers, five across and three deep in each drawer, with connections via [[serial attached SCSI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Open Vault Storage Hardware V0.7 OR-draco-bueana-0.7 |author= Mike Yan and Jon Ehlen |date= January 16, 2013 |url= http://www.opencompute.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Open_Compute_Project_Open_Vault_Storage_Specification_v0.7.pdf |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This storage is also called Knox, and there is also a cold storage variant where idle disks power down to reduce energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Under the hood: Facebook’s cold storage system|date=May 4, 2015|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/1433093613662262/-under-the-hood-facebook-s-cold-storage-system-/|accessdate=May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another design concept was contributed by Hyve Solutions, a division of [[Synnex]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Hyve Solutions Contributes Storage Design Concept to OCP Community |work= News release |date= January 17, 2013 |url= http://ir.synnex.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=733922 |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Torpedo Design Concept Storage Server for Open Rack Hardware v0.3 ST-draco-chimera-0.3 |first= Conor|last= Malone |date= January 15, 2012 |url= http://www.opencompute.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Open_Compute_Project_Storage_Server_for_Open_Rack_Specification_v0.3.pdf  |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the OCP Summit 2016 Facebook together with Taiwanese ODM Wistron's spin-off Wiwynn introduced Lightning, a flexible NVMe JBOF (just a bunch of flash), based on the existing Open Vault (Knox) design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Introducing Lightning: A flexible NVMe JBOF|first=Chris|last=Petersen|date=March 9, 2016|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/989638804458007/introducing-lightning-a-flexible-nvme-jbof/|accessdate= May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Wiwynn Showcases All-Flash Storage Product with Leading-edge NVMe Technology|date=March 9, 2016|url=http://www.wiwynn.com/english/company/newsinfo/23|accessdate= May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mechanical mounting system: Open racks have the same outside width (600&amp;nbsp;mm) and depth as standard [[19-inch rack]]s, but are designed to mount wider chassis with a 537&amp;nbsp;mm width (about 21 inches). This allows more equipment to fit in the same volume and improves air flow. Compute chassis sizes are defined in multiples of an [[Open Rack#OpenU|OpenU]], which is 48&amp;nbsp;mm, slightly larger than the typical [[rack unit]].
* Data center designs for energy efficiency, include 277 VAC power distribution that eliminates one transformer stage in typical data centers. A single voltage (12.5 VDC) power supply designed to work with 277 VAC input and 48 VDC battery backup.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;
* On May 8, 2013, an effort to define an open [[network switch]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Up next for the Open Compute Project: The Network |date= May 8, 2013 |author= Jay Hauser for Frank Frankovsky |work= Open Compute blog |url= http://www.opencompute.org/blog/up-next-for-the-open-compute-project-the-network/ |accessdate= June 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to allow Facebook to load its own [[operating system]] software onto the switch. Press reports predicted that more expensive and higher-performance switches would continue to be popular, while less expensive products treated more like a [[commodity]] (using the [[buzzword]] "top-of-rack") might adopt the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Can Open Compute change network switching? |first= David|last= Chernicoff |work= ZDNet |date= May 9, 2013 |url= http://www.zdnet.com/can-open-compute-change-network-switching-7000015141/ |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar project for a custom switch for the [[Google platform]] had been rumored, and evolved to use the [[OpenFlow]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Facebook Rattles Networking World With 'Open Source' Gear |date= May 8, 2013 |first= Cade|last= Metz |work= Wired |url= https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/05/facebook_networking/ |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Going With the Flow: Google’s Secret Switch to the Next Wave of Networking |date= April 17, 2012 |first= Steven|last= Levy |work= Wired |url= https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/04/going-with-the-flow-google/ |accessdate= July 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first switch open-sourced by Facebook was designed together with Taiwanese ODM [[Accton Technology Corporation|Accton]] using [[Broadcom Corporation|Broadcom]] Trident II chip and is called Wedge, the Linux OS that it runs is called FBOSS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Open Switching System (FBOSS) from Facebook|url=https://www.sdxcentral.com/projects/facebook-open-switching-system-fboss/reports/2017/open-source-networking/|website=[[SDxCentral]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181001142442/https://www.sdxcentral.com/projects/facebook-open-switching-system-fboss/reports/2017/open-source-networking/|archive-date=October 1, 2018|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/681382905244727/introducing-wedge-and-fboss-the-next-steps-toward-a-disaggregated-network/|title=Introducing "Wedge" and "FBOSS," the next steps toward a disaggregated network|website =Meet the engineers who code Facebook|date=June 18, 2014|accessdate = 2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/843620439027582/facebook-open-switching-system-fboss-and-wedge-in-the-open/|title=Facebook Open Switching System ("FBOSS") and Wedge in the open|website=Meet the engineers who code Facebook|date=March 10, 2015|accessdate = 2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later switch contributions include "6-pack" and Wedge-100, based on Broadcom Tomahawk chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.facebook.com/posts/203733993317833/opening-designs-for-6-pack-and-wedge-100/|title=Opening designs for 6-pack and Wedge 100|website=Meet the engineers who code Facebook|date=March 9, 2016|accessdate = 2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar switch hardware designs have been contributed by: [[Edge-Core Networks Corporation]] (Accton spin-off), Mellanox Technologies, Interface Masters Technologies, Agema Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Networking/SpecsAndDesigns|title=Accepted or shared hardware specifications|website=Open Compute|accessdate = 2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capable of running ONIE-compatible operating systems such as [[Cumulus Linux]], Big Switch or [[Pica8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Networking/ONIE/NOS_Status|title=Current Network Operating System (NOS) List|website=Open Compute|accessdate = 2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Prusa i3 is the third printer design by Josef Průša, a core developer of the RepRap project who had previously developed the PCB heated bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2172|title=PCB heated print bed  by josefprusa|last=Thingiverse.com|website=www.thingiverse.com|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first iteration was the Prusa Mendel&lt;ref name="Thingverse" /&gt; produced in 2010 followed by the Prusa Mendel (iteration 2), in 2011.&lt;ref name="Weekend" /&gt; The printer was named Prusa Mendel by the RepRap community rather than Průša himself.&lt;ref name="MakingSoc" /&gt;

The second Prusa Mendel was released in November 2011 and with upgrades including snap fit parts, reduction of the number of tools needed to construct, maintain the printer and improved belts attached to the stepper motors and use of LM8UU linear bearings.&lt;ref name="Weekend"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3dprintingindustry.com/news/hobbyist-weekend-with-prusa-mendel-3d-printer-2594/|title=Hobbyist Weekend – With Prusa Mendel 3D Printer|website=3D Printing Industry|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prusa i3===
In May 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/josefprusa/Prusa3/commit/d3618a65684dae11b45e364b28529af3ea1782e5|title=initial commit · josefprusa/Prusa3@d3618a6|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; designs (produced in [[OpenSCAD]]) for the Prusa i3 were released, it was a major redesign from previous versions and other RepRap printers. The design replaced the triangular threaded rod frame construction with a [[Water jet cutter|water jet cut]] [[Aluminium|aluminum]] frame, had a food-safe hot end called the Prusa Nozzle, and used M5 threaded screws instead of M8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2016/04/18/implicitcad-programmatic-cad-built-with-3d-printing-in-mind/|title=ImplicitCAD: Programmatic CAD Built with 3D Printing in Mind|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackaday.com/2014/11/19/interview-with-a-printer/|title=Interview With A Printer|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20130930-prusa-nozzle-all-metal-food-safe-reprap-hot-end-with-one-piece-design.html|title=Prusa Nozzle: All metal food safe RepRap hot-end|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hackaday.com/2016/04/29/fail-of-the-week-my-3d-printer-upgrade/|title=Fail Of The Week: My 3D Printer Upgrade|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design focused on ease of construction and use rather than maximising the number of self replicated components.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.open-electronics.org/interview-to-josef-prusa/|title=Open Source 3D printing: an Interview with Josef Prusa|website=Open Electronics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Průša released a version which he called the Original Prusa i3, selling through his company Prusa Research.&lt;ref name="PrusaOrg" /&gt;

===Prusa i3 MK2===
In May 2016 the Prusa i3 MK2 was released, it is the first printer with automatic geometry skew correction for all three axes and includes a larger build volume, custom stepper motors with integrated lead screws, mesh bed levelling using a non-contact inductance sensor and a rewritten version of the Marlin [[firmware]].&lt;ref name="Hackaday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160517-prusa-research-unveils-original-prusa-i3-mk2-3d-printer.html|title=Josef Prusa unveils $699 Original Prusa i3 MK2 3D printer|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160517-prusa-research-unveils-original-prusa-i3-mk2-3d-printer.html|title=Josef Prusa unveils $699 Original Prusa i3 MK2 3D printer|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prusaprinters.org/first-printer-to-correct-geometry-in-all-axes/|title=The first printer to correct its geometry in all axes - Prusa Printers|date=2016-08-11|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other new features include a [[polyetherimide]] print surface, Rambo controller board and an E3D V6 Full hotend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://3dprint.com/134786/prusa-i3-mk2-new-features/|title=The All New Original Prusa i3 MK2 Kit Has a Ton of New Features|date=2016-05-18|website=3DPrint.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3dprintingindustry.com/news/interview-josef-prusa-ceo-founder-prusa-research-81650/|title=Interview with Josef Prusa, CEO and Founder of Prusa Research|website=3D Printing Industry|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prusa MK2 became the first RepRap printer to be supported by Windows Plug-and-Play USB ID.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160523-microsoft-adds-network-3d-printing-support-with-windows-10-iot-core-app-for-raspberry-pi-3.html|title=Microsoft adds network 3D printing support with Windows 10 IoT Core app for Raspberry Pi 3|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prusa i3 MK2S===
In March 2017, Josef Prusa announced on his blog &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-i3-mk2s-release/|title=Original Prusa I3 MK2S Release|website=Official Prusa 3D printers community|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Prusa i3 MK2 was now shipping as the Prusa i3 MK2S.  
Enhancements cited include U-bolts to hold the LM8UU bearings, improved LM8UU bearings, smoother rods, an improved mount for the inductance sensor, improved cable management, and a new electronics cover.  While new shipments of the MK2 automatically receive the "S" upgrades, an upgrade kit is available to bring these improvements to earlier purchasers.

===Prusa i3 MK3 and MK2.5===
In September 2017, Prusa i3 MK3 was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Prusa i3 MK3 is out! And it's bloody smart! - Prusa Printers|url=https://www.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-i3-mk3-bloody-smart/|website=Prusa Printers|accessdate=24 October 2017|ref=mk3-announce|date=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; marketed as "bloody smart". Upgraded features included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Original Prusa i3 MK3: Review the Facts Here! {{!}} All3DP|url=https://all3dp.com/original-prusa-i3-mk3-review/|website=All3DP|accessdate=24 October 2017|ref=mk3-review|date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sturdier Y axis, a new [[3D printer extruder|extruder]] with double sided Bondtech drive-gears, quieter fans with rpm monitoring, an updated bed [[leveling]] sensor, a new electronics board named "Einsy", quieter [[Stepper motor|stepper motors]] with 128 step [[Stepper motor#Microstepping|microstepping]] drivers and a magnetic heatbed with interchangeable [[Polyetherimide|PEI]]-coated steel sheets. This model also includes new sensors: several temperature sensors, a filament detector, and a sensor that detects power interruptions. The MK3 runs on 24[[Volt|V]] instead of 12V, so all the electrical components were updated to 24V variants. The printer also offers dedicated sockets to connect [[Raspberry Pi Zero|Raspberry Pi Zero W]] running [[open source]] [[Octoprint]] software for wireless printing, and offers a custom Octoprint build for Prusa i3.

The idea of the MK3 update was to make the printer easier to use for casual users and less likely to lead to failed prints. The filament detector allows users to load filament just by inserting it, and it can detect and pause the print if the filament is jammed or runs out. In both cases, printing resumes normally after the issue is fixed. The new stepper motor drivers can handle skipped steps automatically and prevent layer shifts. The power panic sensor allows the printer to recover from [[power outage]]s, and uses the remaining charge in the [[power supply]]'s [[capacitor]]s to lift the print head up to prevent it from melting the printed part while the power is out. The ambient temperature sensor is able to detect mainboard overheating caused by loose electrical connections.

The upgraded chassis and electronics also allow for faster print speeds — up to 200&amp;nbsp;mm/s.

Existing MK2 and MK2S users were offered a $200 partial upgrade named MK2.5, limited to features which are cheaper to upgrade. After negative feedback from the community, Prusa made available a more expensive $500 MK2S to MK3 full upgrade.

===Clones===
As an open-source design the success of the Prusa i3 is underlined by the ready availability of both complete and kit-built machines that follow the various iterations of the i3 design. Rather than compete directly with these versions, Prusa Research's strategy is to pursue continual refinement of its designs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.prusaprinters.org/whats-up-with-original-prusa-i3/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
In 2012 Josef received honours from the governor of the [[Vysočina Region]] in the [[Czech Republic]] for his accomplishments in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jihlavske-listy.cz/clanek11706-nejvyssi-oceneni-kraje-ziskali-doktorka-nemeckova-a-vytvarnik-ranny.html|title=Jihlavské listy {{!}} Aktuality {{!}} Noviny Kraje Vysočina|website=www.jihlavske-listy.cz|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014 he was featured on the cover of [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]] as one of the 30 under 30 list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/forbescesko/photos/pb.236488496391722.-2207520000.1465767584./707318989308668/?type=3&amp;theater|title=Forbes Česko|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capabilities==
[[File:Josef Prusa in Prusa Research offices inside MK2 printfarm.jpg|thumb|right|Josef Průša inside the Prusa i3 MK2 printfarm producing 3D printed parts at Prusa Research in Prague, Czech Republic.]]

===Self replication===
Like other RepRap printers the Prusa i3 is capable of creating many of its own parts, which were usually printed in ABS plastic prior to the Mk3, which uses PETG instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prusaprinters.org/original-prusa-i3-mk3-2-months/|title=Original Prusa i3 Mk3 after 2 months|website=prusaprinters.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard Prusa i3 has 26 printed parts.

===Printable materials===
Depending on the hot end and heated bed installed, the Prusa i3 is capable of printing many materials including [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)]], [[Polylactic acid|polylactic acid (PLA)]], high impact [[polystyrene]] (HIPS), [[polyetilene]] (PET), different flexible filaments (FLEX, TPU, TPE), [[polypropylene]] (PP) and [[nylon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prusa3d.com/material-guides/|title=Material guides – Prusa3D – 3D Printers from Josef Průša|website=Prusa3D – 3D Printers from Josef Průša|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different materials require different working temperatures and techniques to make them [[Adhesion|adhere]] to the print bed.

==Components==
The Prusa i3, like many RepRap printers, is made from a combination of self-replicated 3D printed parts and off-the-shelf components which are commonly referred to as "vitamins", as they cannot be produced by the printer itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://3dprintingindustry.com/news/distributing-3dp-parts-and-vitamins-with-passion-15476/|title=Distributing 3DP Parts — and Vitamins — With Passion|website=3D Printing Industry|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vitamins used on the Prusa i3 are a combination of common components including threaded rods, smooth rods, screws, nuts, 5 NEMA 17 [[stepper motor]]s and more specialist equipment including a controller board, heated bed and hot end.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Reynolds &amp; Branson Limited Leeds High Street 1900.jpg|thumb| Reynolds &amp; Branson Limited 
14 Commercial Street, Leeds LS1 6AL photo taken 1900 ( Thomas Harvey Chemist shop was designed by the architect George Corson in 1868, He was responsible for many buildings in Leeds including Grand Theatre, Municipal buildings, Apsley House, Spenfield House )]] --&gt;

'''Reynolds &amp; Branson Leeds''' was a business based at 13 Briggate and 14 Commercial Street in [[Leeds]], [[England]]. The business lasted from 1816 to 1972. Edward Matterson managed the company in 1822, and William West F.R.S. took over the in 1833. [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] Records about the company include a day book, [[sales ledger]], and prescription books. The records were created by Reynolds &amp; Branson Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;History Librarium. Historic Camera.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds &amp; Branson was registered in July 1898 as a limited corporation with a capital of £34,000 in shares of £10 each by Messrs. R. Reynolds, F. W. Branson. No [[remuneration]] was given to Mr. R. Reynolds, but a £700 per annum was given to each of the others. In 1890, Richard Reynold's son, Richard Freshfield (Fred) Reynolds was made a partner. 
The firm was in the business of [[Wholesaling|wholesale]] and [[retail]] for [[chemist]]s and surgical instrument makers.

==Origins==
The original company can be traced back to 1816 (see Grace's Guide which is the leading source of historical information on industry and manufacturing in Britain). Edward Matterson was a druggist who ran the firm after being employed by Allen and Hanburys. He was educated at [[Leeds Grammar School]]. In 1822 the company moved to 13 Briggate, Leeds.  In 1833 William West F.R.S. took over the company after Matterson went [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] (see The bankrupt directory: being a complete register of all the bankruptcies, with their residences, trades, and dates when they appeared in the London gazette, from December 1820 to April 1843). In 1839 Thomas Harvey joined the business, when William West left the company to pursue [[analytical chemistry]]. The firm was then renamed Thomas Harvey. Harvey was born at [[Barnsley]] into a [[Quakers|Quaker]] family. His father was a linen manufacturer. The second of five children, he was educated at [[Barnsley Grammar School|Barnsley Grammar]] in [[Yorkshire]] in 1812. From 1822 to 1825 Harvey studied at [[Ackworth, West Yorkshire|Ackworth]] and afterwards became a chemist [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] for David Doncaster of [[Sheffield]]. Upon Doncaster's death he trained at Thomas Southalls in [[Birmingham]] for eight years. In 1837 Harvey settled in Leeds as a chemist. He became an [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery]] [[campaigner]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].

==Richard Reynolds==
In 1844 Richard Reynolds joined the company as an apprentice. He was born in 1829 and was the eldest son of an [[apothecary]] who died when the boy was only four years old. From 1850 to 1851 he attended the School of Pharmacy in [[London]] where he took first prizes in chemistry, materia medica and [[botany]] in a contest held by the pharmaceutical society. He then went to Mr. Henry Deane at Chapman for two years and returned to the Leeds business. In 1854 Richard Reynolds joined Thomas Harvey as a partner and the company then became Harvey &amp; Reynolds. In 1861 the firm was joined by a Mr. Fowler and became Harvey, Reynolds &amp; Fowler. By 1864 Thomas Harvey had retired (Noted in 1884). At the age of 72, he undertook an arduous journey to Canada on a Quaker mission but it exhausted him. He died on December 25 at his home at Ashwood, Headingley Lane.  Mr. Haw then joined the business and the company became Haw &amp; Reynolds. In 1867 the business was listed as Haw, Reynolds, &amp; Co. In 1883 Fredrick W Branson joined the business. An 1884 advertisement listed the partnership between Reynolds &amp; Branson (late Harvey, Reynolds &amp; co).

==1898-1914==
The firm of Reynolds &amp; Branson was registered in July 1898 as a limited corporation with a capital of £34,000 in shares of £10 each by Messrs. R. Reynolds, F. W. Branson. No remuneration was given to Mr. R. Reynolds, but a £700 each per annum to the others. In 1890 Richard Reynold's son, Richard Freshfield (Fred) Reynolds was made a partner. The firm was in the business of wholesale and retail chemists and surgical instrument makers.[5] Fredrick W Branson now focused on the development of scientific apparatus and chemical glassware for the business. The company was flourishing under his management. Frederick Hartridge attended the [[University of Leeds]] in 1905, and then attending the School of Pharmaceutical Society in London in 1909. In 1901, during the outbreak of lead poisoning at Morley, the company was called in. Frederick W. Branson made recommendations which freed Morley from this scourge. In collaboration with A. F. Dimmock, M.D., he contributed to the British Medical Association meeting in 1903 a paper " A new method for the determination of uric acid in urine" (Br. Med. J., 1903, 2, 585). For this process he devised a correction scale which was contributed to the British Pharmaceutical Conference in 1904. At the 1905 meeting of the British Medical Association a further paper by these two authors was read, " A rapid and simple process for the estimation of uric acid " (ibid., 1905, 2, 1104), in which uric acid was precipitated and the precipitate measured in a specially graduated tube. In 1914, in collaboration with Dr. Gordon Sharp, he contributed a paper to the British Pharmaceutical Conference on the activity of digitalis leaves and the stability and standardisation of tinctures of digitalis.

==The war years==
During the First World War, he actively pursued efforts to standardize the size and shape of chemical glassware. In 1916, he was elected as an inaugural member of the Society of Glass Technology. He organized research and published works on these topics. Branson sought to secure in Great Britain the manufacturing process for the glass required for the equipment of munition factories.[8][9] Branson contributed a paper on the composition of some types of chemical glassware to the Society of Chemical Industry (J. SOC. Chem. Ind., 1915, 34, 471) in collaboration with his son Frederick Hartridge, a paper to the Transactions of the Society of Glass Technology (1919, 3, 249)" A proposed standard formula for a glass for lamp workers. Branson was chairman until retirement in 1932. His son, Frederick Hartridge, Associate of the Royal Institute of Chemistry AIC, became chairman and managing director of Reynolds &amp; Branson.[5][7] he run the company for 20 years, until his untimely death on 10 February 1952, Frederick Hartridge had appointed his 3 Sons and Daughter as directors of Reynolds &amp; Branson, Frederick Norman the eldest son who attended Ilkley Grammar an all-boys school, Eileen his only daughter, Peter Orchard who as Director of Phospherade, which was the mineral water company, He attended Roundhay all-boys grammar school.

In the Second World War he was in the RAF with 54 Spitfire squadron, in 1942 married Rita Blackburn, he went to Australia with 54 Spitfire squadron at the end of 1942, he met Patricia A Grant his second wife. He married Patricia in Leeds 1948, Peter emigrated to Australia 1953, when his father died leaving the bulk of the business to his eldest brother Frederick Norman, He set up his own pharmacy in Blackburn South in 1955, He later become a Podiatrist retiring at the age of 90, Richard Orchard who attended Roundhay all-boys grammar school, Second World War Richard was also in RAF as a pilot he died on active service 1945. His eldest son Frederick Norman Branson became Chairman &amp; Managing Director of Reynolds &amp; Branson in 1953, he would run Reynolds &amp; Branson for almost 20 years, at this point the company had a workforce of 150 people, In 1972 Frederick Norman Branson sold the business to Barclay, later selling to the asset strippers Slater &amp; Walker.

==X-ray pioneers==
On 24 July 1896, Reynolds and Branson attended the Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom at Leeds. The firm was represented in various sessions. During the session on Orthochromatic Photography, Branson gave a presentation on [[Radiographic equipment|X-ray apparatus]] that included a well received demonstration and repeated as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Petter, and Galpin. (24 July 1896). Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom, Leeds, 1896. The Photographic News for Amateur Photographers. Volume 40. Page 471.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"... Mr. Branson, of Messrs. Reynolds and Branson, who had made a special study of X ray work, gave a demonstration which for lucidity and completeness has rarely been equalled. In the course of his remarks he fully explained the construction and exhaustion of the tubes, and showed various forms and explained his method of making calcium tungstate, which was to mix solutions of sodium tungstate and calcium chloride, collect, wash, and dry the precipitate of calcium tungstate which was formed, and then to fuse this in a small muffle furnace at the temperature of the melting point of cast-iron, and reduce to small crystals in a mortar, mix with varnish, and coat a screen. With such a screen in contact with the plate he had been able to show osseous structure of the hand, measuring only one-hundredth of an inch, with an exposure of one minute. A comparison of the fluorescent appearance of the three salts, calcium tungstate, platinocyanide of barium, and platinocyanide of potassium, was shown, the first and last being the best for photographic work, as the fluorescence was blue, and the barium salt was most satisfactory for visual work, as the fluorescence was yellow."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same convention, during the session on Photography at the Seaside the firm displayed some of their product line that included [[X-ray]] apparatus, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Petter, and Galpin. (24 July 1896). Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom, Leeds, 1896. The Photographic News for Amateur Photographers. Volume 40. Page 473.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Reynolds &amp; Branson, of Commercial Street, Leeds, had a very high-class show, special prominence being given to apparatus for [[X ray]] work. A case of [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] of all the leading makers, together with a very well-made photo-micrographic outfit, a cabinet of chemicals, another of cameras, and all the little odds and ends of apparatus, made up a very fine show."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8410">[[Image:ST124-M drawing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Drawing of ST-124M Inertial Platform.]]

The '''ST-124-M3 inertial platform''' was a device for measuring acceleration and attitude of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle. It was carried by the [[Saturn V Instrument Unit]], a {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}}, {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} section of the Saturn V that fit between the third stage (S-IVB) and the Apollo spacecraft. Its nomenclature means "stable table" (ST) for use in the moon mission (M), and it has 3 gimbals.&lt;ref&gt;Newsbureau, The Bendix Corporation, "Globe-shaped platform keeps Apollo on target."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
It was number 124 in a series of similar devices, including the ST-120 (used in the Pershing missile), the ST-90 (used on the Jupiter and on early Saturn I flights), and the ST-80 (used in the Redstone). They are descendants of the LEV-3 of the German V-2 rocket.&lt;ref&gt;Stages To Saturn, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The ST-124 was designed by Marshall Space Flight Center and manufactured by Bendix Corporation, [[Eclipse-Pioneer]] Division, in Teterboro, NJ. It took 9 men 22 to 24 weeks to assemble an ST-124, and 70 percent of that time was spent installing about 3,000 wires.&lt;ref&gt;Newsbureau, The Bendix Corporation, "Globe-shaped platform keeps Apollo on target."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission history==
The ST-124 stabilized platform was part of the navigation, control and guidance system of the Saturn V. Data from the ST-124 were used  by the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer|Launch Vehicle Digital Computer]] (another Instrument Unit component) to compare actual flight data to programmed flight plans and to calculate guidance corrections. Though the ST-124 operated all during the mission, its data were not used for guidance while the vehicle was in the atmosphere, where it was subjected to high drag forces. In this region, basically the time of the first stage burn, the vehicle followed a simple preprogrammed flight plan.&lt;ref&gt;NASA TN D-5869, page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal details==
The attitude of the vehicle was measured relative to a coordinate system that was fixed just prior to launch with the X coordinate vertical, the Z coordinate in the direction of the pitch maneuver (down range, roughly East), and the Y coordinate perpendicular to the other two, cross range, roughly South. At the heart of the ST-124 was a platform that was held in a fixed orientation; hence the name "stabilized platform". It is connected by three [[gimbal]]s that allowed the vehicle to roll, pitch and yaw but the stable platform to be held fixed in space. It was being translated, of course, but did not tilt during flight.

The platform is stabilized by three [[gyroscope|gyros]] mounted on it. One measured any rotations about the X axis, one about the Y, and one about the Z axis. They generated signals that were shaped in feedback circuits and sent back to torquers on the inner, middle and outer gimbals that exactly countered the rotations, nulling the gyro outputs and keeping the platform stable.

The inner gimbal also carries three accelerometers, two pendulums, and a pair of prisms. The accelerometers measured vehicle acceleration along the X, Y, and Z axes. Their outputs were used by the LVDC to measure actual vehicle motion, for the purpose of navigation. The pendulums were used to set the X axis exactly vertical, and the prisms were used to align the Y and Z axes, just before launch. The prisms reflected infrared beams sent into the ST-124 by a theodolite stationed 700 feet away from the launch pad. Commands from the theodolite were transmitted via cables to the vehicle, to torquers in the ST-124 to orient the stable platform toward the correct azimuth.

The gyros, accelerometers and pendulums contain almost frictionless nitrogen gas bearings. These required very precise machining and very small gaps between the bearing surfaces. Dimensions were held to tolerances of 20 microinches (0.5&amp;nbsp;µm),&lt;ref&gt;NASA TN D-2983, page 53: "The sleeve, endplates, and cylinder are constructed of beryllium with machined tolerances of 20 micro inches in roundness and 20 micro inches/inch in squareness."&lt;/ref&gt;  and the gap filled by the nitrogen is about 600-800 microinches.&lt;ref&gt;NASA TN D-5869, page 20: Gas bearing air gap 0.0015-0.002 cm. This is 0.000591- 0.000787 inches, or 600-800 micro inches.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nitrogen entered the gyros at about 15 psi and was vented to space via a pressure regulator in the bottom of the ST-124 that opened at 13 psi. The large silver sphere to the left of the ST-124 held the supply of nitrogen for the bearings.

The ST-124 includes many components made of anodized beryllium. This material was chosen for its stiffness, light weight, machinability and stability. The case of the ST-124 is a short cylinder, 7.5&amp;nbsp;inches high and 21&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter, made of beryllium. The ends of the cylinder are closed by two approximately hemispherical aluminum covers. The gimbals and several parts of the gyros and accelerometers are also made of beryllium.

In contrast to beryllium, which is lightweight, the rotors of the gyros are made of a very dense, strong material, Elkonite.{{clarify|reason=There are many grades of Elkonite, so please clarify which one|date=April 2011}} This is a sintered form of tungsten, with about 10 percent copper, to make it machinable.

Heat generated by torquers and other electrical equipment inside the ST-124 was carried away by cooling coils built into the aluminum covers. A mixture of methanol and water at 15 degrees C was circulated through the coils. The internal temperature of the ST-124 stabilized at about 42 degrees C.&lt;ref&gt;NASA TN D-2983, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the W3C, "The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries".&lt;ref name="W3C-SWA" /&gt; The Semantic Web is therefore regarded as an integrator across different content, information applications and systems.

The term was coined by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] for a web of data (or '''data web''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2007-04-09/q-and-a-with-tim-berners-leebusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|title=Q&amp;A with Tim Berners-Lee, Special Report |author=|date=|website=businessweek.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be processed by machines&lt;ref name="Berners-Lee"/&gt;—that is, one in which much of the [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] is [[machine-readable data|machine-readable]]. While its critics have questioned its feasibility, proponents argue that applications in industry, biology and human sciences research have already proven the validity of the original concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |url=http://www.thefigtrees.net/lee/sw/sciam/semantic-web-in-action |title=The Semantic Web in Action |publisher=Scientific American |date=May 1, 2007 |author=Lee Feigenbaum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berners-Lee originally expressed his vision of the Semantic Web as follows:
{{quote|I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web&amp;nbsp;– the content, links, and transactions between people and computers. A "Semantic Web", which makes this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines. The "[[intelligent agent]]s" people have touted for ages will finally materialize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee |author2=Fischetti, Mark |title=[[Tim Berners Lee#Weaving the Web|Weaving the Web]] |publisher=[[HarperSanFrancisco]] |year=1999 |pages=chapter 12 |isbn=978-0-06-251587-2 |nopp=true }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 2001 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by Berners-Lee, [[James Hendler|Hendler]], and [[Ora Lassila|Lassila]] described an expected evolution of the existing Web to a Semantic Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=March 13, 2008 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/566c/1c6bd366b4c9e07fc37eb372771690d5ba31.pdf |title=The Semantic Web |publisher=Scientific American |date=May 17, 2001 |author=Berners-Lee, Tim }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Berners-Lee and colleagues stated that: "This simple idea…remains largely unrealized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Example ==
In the following example, the text 'Paul Schuster was born in Dresden' on a Website will be annotated, connecting a person with their place of birth. The following [[HTML]]-fragment shows how a small graph is being described, in [[RDFa]]-syntax using a [[schema.org]] vocabulary and a [[Wikidata]] ID:
[[File:RDF example.svg|framed|anchor|{{anchor|graph1}}Graph resulting from the RDFa example]]
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="html5" enclose="div"&gt;
&lt;div vocab="http://schema.org/" typeof="Person"&gt;
  &lt;span property="name"&gt;Paul Schuster&lt;/span&gt; was born in
  &lt;span property="birthPlace" typeof="Place" href="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731"&gt;
    &lt;span property="name"&gt;Dresden&lt;/span&gt;.
  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The example defines the following five [[Semantic triple|triples]] (shown in [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] Syntax). Each triple represents one edge in the resulting graph: the first element of the triple (the ''subject'') is the name of the node where the edge starts, the second element (the ''predicate'') the type of the edge, and the last and third element (the ''object'') either the name of the node where the edge ends or a literal value (e.g. a text, a number, etc.).
&lt;div class="plainlinks"&gt;
 _:a &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://schema.org/Person&gt; .
 _:a &lt;http://schema.org/name&gt; "Paul Schuster" .
 _:a &lt;http://schema.org/birthPlace&gt; &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&gt; .
 &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&gt; &lt;http://schema.org/itemtype&gt; &lt;http://schema.org/Place&gt; .
 &lt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&gt; &lt;http://schema.org/name&gt; "Dresden" .
&lt;/div&gt;

The triples result in the graph shown in [[#graph1|the given figure]].

[[File:RDF example extended.svg|framed|Graph resulting from the RDFa example, enriched with further data from the Web]]

One of the advantages of using [[Uniform Resource Identifier|Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)]] is that they can be dereferenced using the [[HTTP]] protocol. According to the so-called [[Linked Open Data]] principles, such a dereferenced URI should result in a document that offers further data about the given URI. In this example, all URIs, both for edges and nodes (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://schema.org/Person&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://schema.org/birthPlace&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;) can be dereferenced and will result in further RDF graphs, describing the URI, e.g. that Dresden is a city in Germany, or that a person, in the sense of that URI, can be fictional.

The second graph shows the previous example, but now enriched with a few of the triples from the documents that result from dereferencing &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://schema.org/Person&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (green edge) and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1731&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (blue edges).

Additionally to the edges given in the involved documents explicitly, edges can be automatically [[Inference|inferred]]: the triple
&lt;div class="plainlinks"&gt;
 _:a &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://schema.org/Person&gt; .
&lt;/div&gt;

from the original RDFa fragment and the triple
&lt;div class="plainlinks"&gt;
 &lt;http://schema.org/Person&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#equivalentClass&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&gt; .
&lt;/div&gt;

from the document at &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://schema.org/Person&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (green edge in the Figure) allow to infer the following triple, given [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] semantics (red dashed line in the second Figure):
&lt;div class="plainlinks"&gt;
 _:a &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt; &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person&gt; .
&lt;/div&gt;

== Background ==

The concept of the ''[[Semantic network|Semantic Network Model]]'' was formed in the early 1960s by the cognitive scientist [[Allan M. Collins]], linguist [[M. Ross Quillian]] and psychologist [[Elizabeth F. Loftus]] as a form to represent semantically structured knowledge. When applied in the context of the modern internet, it extends the network of [[hyperlink]]ed human-readable [[web pages]] by inserting machine-readable [[metadata]] about pages and how they are related to each other.  This enables automated agents to access the Web more intelligently and perform more tasks on behalf of users. The term "Semantic Web" was coined by [[Tim Berners-Lee]],&lt;ref name="Berners-Lee"/&gt; the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] ("[[W3C]]"), which oversees the development of proposed Semantic Web standards. He defines the Semantic Web as "a web of data that can be processed directly and indirectly by machines".

Many of the technologies proposed by the W3C already existed before they were positioned under the W3C umbrella. These are used in various contexts, particularly those dealing with information that encompasses a limited and defined domain, and where sharing data is a common necessity, such as scientific research or data exchange among businesses. In addition, other technologies with similar goals have emerged, such as [[microformat]]s.

=== Limitations of HTML ===
Many files on a typical computer can also be loosely divided into human readable [[document]]s and machine readable [[data]]. Documents like mail messages, reports, and brochures are read by humans. Data, such as calendars, addressbooks, playlists, and spreadsheets are presented using an application program that lets them be viewed, searched and combined.

Currently, the World Wide Web is based mainly on documents written in [[Hypertext Markup Language]] ([[HTML]]), a markup convention that is used for coding a body of text interspersed with multimedia objects such as images and interactive forms. Metadata tags provide a method by which computers can categorise the content of web pages, for example:

&lt;source lang="html4strict"&gt;
&lt;meta name="keywords" content="computing, computer studies, computer" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="description" content="Cheap widgets for sale" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="author" content="John Doe" /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

With HTML and a tool to render it (perhaps [[web browser]] software, perhaps another [[user agent]]), one can create and present a page that lists items for sale. The HTML of this catalog page can make simple, document-level assertions such as "this document's title is 'Widget Superstore{{'"}}, but there is no capability within the HTML itself to assert unambiguously that, for example, item number X586172 is an Acme Gizmo with a retail price of €199, or that it is a consumer product. Rather, HTML can only say that the span of text "X586172" is something that should be positioned near "Acme Gizmo" and "€199", etc. There is no way to say "this is a catalog" or even to establish that "Acme Gizmo" is a kind of title or that "€199" is a price. There is also no way to express that these pieces of information are bound together in describing a discrete item, distinct from other items perhaps listed on the page.

[[Semantic HTML]] refers to the traditional HTML practice of markup following intention, rather than specifying layout details directly. For example, the use of {{tag|em|o}} denoting "emphasis" rather than {{tag|i|o}}, which specifies [[italics]]. Layout details are left up to the browser, in combination with [[Cascading Style Sheets]]. But this practice falls short of specifying the semantics of objects such as items for sale or prices.

[[Microformat]]s extend HTML syntax to create [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]] semantic markup about objects including people, organisations, events and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allsopp |first=John | title=Microformats: Empowering Your Markup for Web 2.0 |date=March 2007 |publisher=[[Apress|Friends of ED]] |isbn=978-1-59059-814-6 |page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar initiatives include [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[Schema.org]].

=== Semantic Web solutions ===
The Semantic Web takes the solution further. It involves publishing in languages specifically designed for data: [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), and Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]). HTML describes documents and the links between them. RDF, OWL, and XML, by contrast, can describe arbitrary things such as people, meetings, or airplane parts.

These technologies are combined in order to provide descriptions that supplement or replace the content of Web documents. Thus, content may manifest itself as descriptive data stored in Web-accessible [[database]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Artem Chebotko and Shiyong Lu, "Querying the Semantic Web: An Efficient Approach Using Relational Databases", [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]], {{ISBN|978-3-8383-0264-5}}, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; or as markup within documents (particularly, in Extensible HTML ([[XHTML]]) interspersed with XML, or, more often, purely in XML, with layout or rendering cues stored separately). The machine-readable descriptions enable content managers to add meaning to the content, i.e., to describe the structure of the knowledge we have about that content. In this way, a machine can process knowledge itself, instead of text, using processes similar to human [[deductive reasoning]] and [[inference]], thereby obtaining more meaningful results and helping computers to perform automated information gathering and research.

An example of a tag that would be used in a non-semantic web page:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;item&gt;blog&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Encoding similar information in a semantic web page might look like this:
&lt;source lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;item rdf:about="http://example.org/semantic-web/"&gt;Semantic Web&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Tim Berners-Lee calls the resulting network of [[Linked Data]] the [[Giant Global Graph]], in contrast to the HTML-based [[World Wide Web]]. Berners-Lee posits that if the past was document sharing, the future is data sharing. His answer to the question of "how" provides three points of instruction. One, a URL should point to the data. Two, anyone accessing the URL should get data back. Three, relationships in the data should point to additional URLs with data.

=== Web 3.0 ===

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] has described the semantic web as a component of "Web 3.0".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

"Semantic Web" is sometimes used as a synonym for "Web 3.0",&lt;ref name="vvv"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tweakandtrick.com/2012/05/web-30.html |title=Introducing The Concept Of Web 3.0 |author=Akhilesh Sharma |accessdate=10 January 2017 |work=Tweak And Trick}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the definition of each term varies. Web 3.0 has started to emerge as a movement away from the [[centralisation]] of services like search, social media and chat applications that are dependent on a single organisation to function.&lt;ref name="adw"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/09/a-decentralized-web-would-give-power-back-to-the-people-online/ |title=A decentralized web would give power back to the people online |author=Matthew Hodgson |accessdate=1 December 2016 |date=9 October 2016 |work=TechCrunch |publisher=AOL Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Some of the challenges for the Semantic Web include vastness, vagueness, uncertainty, inconsistency, and deceit. [[Automated reasoning system]]s will have to deal with all of these issues in order to deliver on the promise of the Semantic Web.
* Vastness: The World Wide Web contains many billions of pages. The [[SNOMED CT]] medical terminology [[ontology (information science)|ontology]] alone contains 370,000 class names, and existing technology has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms. Any automated reasoning system will have to deal with truly huge inputs.
* Vagueness: These are imprecise concepts like "young" or "tall". This arises from the vagueness of user queries, of concepts represented by content providers, of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts. [[Fuzzy logic]] is the most common technique for dealing with vagueness.
* Uncertainty: These are precise concepts with uncertain values. For example, a patient might present a set of symptoms that correspond to a number of different distinct diagnoses each with a different probability. [[Probabilistic logic|Probabilistic]] reasoning techniques are generally employed to address uncertainty.
* Inconsistency: These are logical contradictions that will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies, and when ontologies from separate sources are combined. [[Deductive reasoning]] fails catastrophically when faced with inconsistency, because [[Principle of explosion|"anything follows from a contradiction"]]. [[Defeasible reasoning]] and [[Paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent reasoning]] are two techniques that can be employed to deal with inconsistency.
* Deceit: This is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information. [[Cryptography]] techniques are currently utilized to alleviate this threat. By providing a means to determine the information's integrity, including that which relates to the identity of the entity that produced or published the information, however [[credibility]] issues still have to be addressed in cases of potential deceit.

This list of challenges is illustrative rather than exhaustive, and it focuses on the challenges to the "unifying logic" and "proof" layers of the Semantic Web. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) Incubator Group for Uncertainty Reasoning for the World Wide Web (URW3-XG) [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/urw3/XGR-urw3-20080331/ final report] lumps these problems together under the single heading of "uncertainty". Many of the techniques mentioned here will require extensions to the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for example to annotate conditional probabilities. This is an area of active research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lukasiewicz |first=Thomas |author2=Umberto Straccia |title=Managing uncertainty and vagueness in description logics for the Semantic Web |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826808000395|doi=10.1016/j.websem.2008.04.001 |volume=6 |issue=4 |journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web |pages=291–308|year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standards ==
Standardization for Semantic Web in the context of Web 3.0 is under the care of W3C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Main_Page|title=Semantic Web Standards|author=|date=|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Components ===
The term "Semantic Web" is often used more specifically to refer to the formats and technologies that enable it.&lt;ref name="W3C-SWA" /&gt; The collection, structuring and recovery of linked data are enabled by technologies that provide a [[description logic|formal description]] of concepts, terms, and relationships within a given [[knowledge domain]]. These technologies are specified as W3C standards and include:
* [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF), a general method for describing information
* [[RDF Schema]] (RDFS)
* [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS)
* [[SPARQL]], an RDF query language
* [[Notation3]] (N3), designed with human-readability in mind
* [[N-Triples]], a format for storing and transmitting data
* [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]] (Terse RDF Triple Language)
* [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL), a family of knowledge representation languages
* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF), a framework of web rule language dialects supporting rule interchange on the Web

[[File:Semantic_web_stack.svg|frame |right | |The [[Semantic Web Stack]].]]

The [[Semantic Web Stack]] illustrates the architecture of the Semantic Web. The functions and relationships of the components can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/ |title=OWL Web Ontology Language Overview |date=February 10, 2004 |publisher=World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* XML provides an elemental syntax for content structure within documents, yet associates no semantics with the meaning of the content contained within. XML is not at present a necessary component of Semantic Web technologies in most cases, as alternative syntaxes exists, such as [[Turtle (syntax)|Turtle]]. Turtle is a de facto standard, but has not been through a formal standardization process.
* [[W3C XML Schema|XML Schema]] is a language for providing and restricting the structure and content of elements contained within XML documents.
* RDF is a simple language for expressing [[data model]]s, which refer to objects ("[[web resource]]s") and their relationships. An RDF-based model can be represented in a variety of syntaxes, e.g., RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, and RDFa. RDF is a fundamental standard of the Semantic Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/RDF/ | title=Resource Description Framework (RDF) | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=978-0-12-385965-5 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-385965-5.10003-2 | author1=Allemang, D. | author2=Hendler, J.| chapter=RDF –The basis of the Semantic Web | title = Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist | edition= 2nd | publisher=Morgan Kaufmann | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* RDF Schema extends RDF and is a vocabulary for describing properties and classes of RDF-based resources, with semantics for generalized-hierarchies of such properties and classes.
* OWL adds more vocabulary for describing properties and classes: among others, relations between classes (e.g. disjointness), cardinality (e.g. "exactly one"), equality, richer typing of properties, characteristics of properties (e.g. symmetry), and enumerated classes.
* SPARQL is a protocol and query language for semantic web data sources.
* RIF is the W3C Rule Interchange Format. It's an XML language for expressing Web rules that computers can execute. RIF provides multiple versions, called dialects. It includes a RIF Basic Logic Dialect (RIF-BLD) and RIF Production Rules Dialect (RIF PRD).

=== Current state of standardization ===
Well-established standards:
* [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]
* [[RDFS]]
* [[Rule Interchange Format]] (RIF)
* [[SPARQL]]
* [[Unicode]]
* [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]
* [[Web Ontology Language]] (OWL)
* [[XML]]

Not yet fully realized:
* Unifying Logic and Proof layers
* [[Semantic Web Rule Language]] (SWRL)

==Applications==

The intent is to enhance the [[usability]] and usefulness of the Web and its interconnected [[resource (computer science)|resources]] by creating [[Semantic Web Services]], such as:
* Servers that expose existing data systems using the RDF and SPARQL standards. Many [http://esw.w3.org/topic/ConverterToRdf converters to RDF] exist from different applications. [[Relational database]]s are an important source. The semantic web server attaches to the existing system without affecting its operation.
* Documents "marked up" with semantic information (an [[Extensibility|extension]] of the HTML &lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;meta&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt; [[HTML element|tags]] used in today's Web pages to supply information for [[Web search engine]]s using [[web crawler]]s). This could be [[Artificial intelligence|machine-understandable]] information about the human-understandable content of the document (such as the creator, title, description, etc.) or it could be purely [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] representing a set of facts (such as resources and services elsewhere on the site). Note that ''anything'' that can be identified with a ''Uniform Resource Identifier'' (URI) can be described, so the semantic web can reason about animals, people, places, ideas, etc.  There are four semantic annotation formats that can be used in HTML documents; [[Microformat]], [[RDFa]], [[Microdata (HTML)|Microdata]] and [[JSON-LD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web: From HTML5 Microdata to Linked Open Data|last = Sikos|first = Leslie F.|publisher = Apress|year = 2015|isbn = 1484210492|location = |pages = 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic markup is often generated automatically, rather than manually.
* Common metadata vocabularies ([[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]]) and maps between vocabularies that allow document creators to know how to mark up their documents so that agents can use the information in the supplied metadata (so that ''Author'' in the sense of 'the Author of the page' won't be confused with ''Author'' in the sense of a book that is the subject of a book review).
* Automated agents to perform tasks for users of the semantic web using this data.
* Web-based services (often with agents of their own) to supply information specifically to agents, for example, a [[Trust service]] that an agent could ask if some online store has a history of poor service or [[spamming]].

Such services could be useful to public search engines, or could be used for [[knowledge management]] within an organization.  Business applications include:
* Facilitating the integration of information from mixed sources
* Dissolving ambiguities in corporate terminology
* Improving [[information retrieval]] thereby reducing information overload and increasing the refinement and precision of the data retrieved&lt;ref&gt;

* Providing decision making support

In a corporation, there is a closed group of users and the management is able to enforce company guidelines like the adoption of specific [[Ontology (information science)|ontologies]] and use of [[semantic annotation]]. Compared to the public Semantic Web there are lesser requirements on [[scalability]] and the information circulating within a company can be more trusted in general; privacy is less of an issue outside of handling of customer data.

== Skeptical reactions ==

=== Practical feasibility ===
Critics question the basic feasibility of a complete or even partial fulfillment of the Semantic Web, pointing out both difficulties in setting it up and a lack of general-purpose usefulness that prevents the required effort from being invested. In a 2003 paper, Marshall and Shipman point out the cognitive overhead inherent in formalizing knowledge, compared to the authoring of traditional web [[hypertext]]:&lt;ref name="which"&gt;{{cite conference |title=Which semantic web? |last1=Marshall |first1=Catherine C. |last2=Shipman |first2=Frank M. |conference=Proc. ACM Conf. on Hypertext and Hypermedia |pages=57–66 |year=2003 |url=http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~marshall/ht03-sw-4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|While learning the basics of HTML is relatively straightforward, learning a knowledge representation language or tool requires the author to learn about the representation's methods of abstraction and their effect on reasoning. For example, understanding the class-instance relationship, or the superclass-subclass relationship, is more than understanding that one concept is a “type of” another concept. […] These abstractions are taught to computer scientists generally and knowledge engineers specifically but do not match the similar natural language meaning of being a "type of" something. Effective use of such a formal representation requires the author to become a skilled knowledge engineer in addition to any other skills required by the domain. […] Once one has learned a formal representation language, it is still often much more effort to express ideas in that representation than in a less formal representation […]. Indeed, this is a form of programming based on the declaration of semantic data and requires an understanding of how reasoning algorithms will interpret the authored structures.}}

According to Marshall and Shipman, the [[tacit knowledge|tacit]] and changing nature of much knowledge adds to the knowledge engineering problem, and limits the Semantic Web's applicability to specific domains. A further issue that they point out are domain- or organisation-specific ways to express knowledge, which must be solved through community agreement rather than only technical means.{{r|which}} As it turns out, specialized communities and organizations for intra-company projects have tended to adopt semantic web technologies greater than peripheral and less-specialized communities.&lt;ref name="Herman000"&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.w3.org/2007/Talks/0424-Stavanger-IH/Slides.pdf |title=State of the Semantic Web |accessdate=July 26, 2007 |author=Ivan Herman |year=2007 |conference=Semantic Days 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practical constraints toward adoption have appeared less challenging where domain and scope is more limited than that of the general public and the World-Wide Web.{{r|Herman000}}

Finally, Marshall and Shipman see pragmatic problems in the idea of ([[Knowledge Navigator]]-style) intelligent agents working in the largely manually curated Semantic Web:{{r|which}}

{{quote|In situations in which user needs are known and distributed information resources are well described, this approach can be highly effective; in situations that are not foreseen and that bring together an unanticipated array of information resources, the Google approach is more robust. Furthermore, the Semantic Web relies on inference chains that are more brittle; a missing element of the chain results in a failure to perform the desired action, while the human can supply missing pieces in a more Google-like approach. […] cost-benefit tradeoffs can work in favor of specially-created Semantic Web metadata directed at weaving together sensible well-structured domain-specific information resources; close attention to user/customer needs will drive these federations if they are to be successful.}}

[[Cory Doctorow]]'s critique ("[[metacrap]]") is from the perspective of human behavior and personal preferences. For example, people may include spurious metadata into Web pages in an attempt to mislead Semantic Web engines that naively assume the metadata's veracity. This phenomenon was well-known with metatags that fooled the [[Altavista]] ranking algorithm into elevating the ranking of certain Web pages: the Google indexing engine specifically looks for such attempts at manipulation. [[Peter Gärdenfors]] and [[Timo Honkela]] point out that logic-based semantic web technologies cover only a fraction of the relevant phenomena related to semantics.&lt;ref name="Gardenfors04"&gt;{{Cite book

=== Censorship and privacy ===
Enthusiasm about the semantic web could be tempered by concerns regarding [[Internet censorship|censorship]] and [[privacy]]. For instance, [[Intelligent text analysis|text-analyzing]] techniques can now be easily bypassed by using other words, metaphors for instance, or by using images in place of words. An advanced implementation of the semantic web would make it much easier for governments to control the viewing and creation of online information, as this information would be much easier for an automated content-blocking machine to understand. In addition, the issue has also been raised that, with the use of [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] files and geolocation [[meta-data]], there would be very little anonymity associated with the authorship of articles on things such as a personal blog. Some of these concerns were addressed in the "Policy Aware Web" project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyawareweb.org/ |title=Policy Aware Web Project |publisher=Policyawareweb.org |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is an active research and development topic.

=== Doubling output formats ===
Another criticism of the semantic web is that it would be much more time-consuming to create and publish content because there would need to be two formats for one piece of data: one for human viewing and one for machines. However, many [[web application]]s in development are addressing this issue by creating a machine-readable format upon the publishing of data or the request of a machine for such data. The development of [[microformat]]s has been one reaction to this kind of criticism. Another argument in defense of the feasibility of semantic web is the likely falling price of human intelligence tasks in digital labor markets, such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon Mechanical Turk|Mechanical Turk]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Specifications such as [[eRDF (data format)|eRDF]] and [[RDFa]] allow arbitrary RDF data to be embedded in HTML pages. The [[GRDDL]] (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Language) mechanism allows existing material (including microformats) to be automatically interpreted as RDF, so publishers only need to use a single format, such as HTML.

== Research activities on corporate applications ==

The first research group explicitly focusing on the Corporate Semantic Web was the ACACIA team at [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis]], founded in 2002. Results of their work include the [[RDF Schema|RDF(S)]] based [http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/soft/corese/ Corese] [[search engine]], and the application of semantic web technology in the realm of [[E-learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Future of applications===
[[Tim O'Reilly]], who coined the term [[Web 2.0]] proposed a long-term vision of the Semantic Web as a web of data, where sophisticated applications manipulate the data web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/apr/06/guardianweeklytechnologysection.timbernerslee|title=Spread the word, and join it up|first=S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10109">The '''Shetab''' (Interbank Information Transfer Network) system is an [[electronic banking]] clearance and automated payments system used in [[Iran]]. The system was introduced in 2002 with the intention of creating a uniform backbone for the Iranian banking system to handle [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], [[Point of sale|POS]] and other card-based transactions.

{{Infobox Interbank Network
| name          = Shetab Banking System

Prior to its introduction, some Iranian banks were issuing cards that only worked on the issuing banks ATMs and POS machines. Since the introduction of Shetab, all banks must adhere to its standards and be able to connect to it. Furthermore, all issued credit or [[debit cards]] must be Shetab capable. As of the end of 2016, the Shetab system had 44,013 ATMs connected to it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dailytahlil.com/content?cid=48406 |title=Number of active ATMs in Iran |accessdate=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Communications in Iran#Electronic commerce|Industry of Iran#Retail industry|l1=E-commerce in Iran|l2=Retail industry in Iran}}
Shetab was introduced in 2002, and now all card issuing banks in Iran are required to connect to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nitc.co.ir/bank/page/2503.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313023214/http://www.nitc.co.ir/bank/page/2503.aspx |archivedate=2007-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, when the system was introduced there were at approximately 2.8 million domestic debit cards in circulation, of those approximately 530,000 were capable of using the Shetab system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=|url=http://a248.e.akamai.net/7/248/3622/2a5c666c2dbb17/www.markets.img.hsbc.com/public/tcm/cibm/pcm/pdf/03.12.30%20Iranfinalword.pdf.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[government of Iran|government]] obliged the [[Central Bank of Iran]] and the [[List of banks in Iran|Iranian banks]], mostly state owned, to set up all the necessary infrastructures (regulatory, hardware, software) for fully launching e-money in Iran by March 2005. While this plan has not yet fully materialised, local debit/credit cards are now commonplace and have removed the main obstacle to the growth of e-commerce (in the national scale) as well as the full roll out of e-government initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrade.gov.au/ICT-to-Iran/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010 it is expected that 12 million cards would be issued, all of which work with the Shetab system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2411/html/focus.htm Iran Daily - Economic Focus - 10/27/05&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427032058/http://www.iran-daily.com/1384/2411/html/focus.htm |date=2006-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Agricultural Bank ([[Keshavarzi Bank]]) was the first Iranian bank to connect to the Shetab system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agri-bank.com/Static/English/About/Profile.asp Agri bank - About Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006192729/http://www.agri-bank.com/Static/English/About/Profile.asp |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saman Bank Corp|Saman Bank]] was the first bank to introduce [[online banking]] services in Iran. Since, it has been at the forefront of expansion and enhancement of electronic banking.

In 2007, before the imposition of new [[sanctions against Iran]], Tetra-Tech IT Company announced that using [[VISA]] and [[MasterCard]] is now possible for online sales and in Iranian e-card terminals at shopping malls, hotels, restaurants, and travel agencies for Iranians and foreign tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://payvand.com/news/07/feb/1159.html|title=VISA and MasterCard usage possible in Iran|last=|first=|date=2007-02-13|website=payvand.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314031627/http://payvand.com/news/07/feb/1159.html|archive-date=2018-03-14|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's [[electronic commerce]] will reach 10,000 billion rials ($US1 billion) by March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0812030911192309.htm IRNA: Iran's e-commerce to reach rls10,000b] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815143518/http://www2.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0812030911192309.htm |date=2009-08-15 }} Retrieved December 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 nearly every bank branch in Iran had a Shetab system Connected ATM unit. More  than 70% of shops, restaurants and markets are connected to the Shetab system. Many online stores are also linked to the Shetab system., Mobile and SMS Banking are recent additions to the Shetab system.

==Impact==
{{see also|Iranian Economic Reform Plan}}
As of 2006, Iran was still very much a cash based society. It is expected that a unified clearance system, such as Shetab, will provide significantly greater [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]], reduce crime, reduce money printing costs, and improve tax collection among other benefits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; It is also expected to improve the quality of life of citizens whom, once the system is fully operational, would no longer be required to spend significant amounts of time organizing things in person and would consequently be able to conduct activities immediately over the phone or over the [[internet]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The impact of the system is already being felt as corporations establish [[e-commerce]], [[supply chains]], [[online banking]] and retailing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5533960/IRAN-FIRST-E-BANK-OPENS.html|title=Find Local Contractors {{!}} Home Remodeling Contractors on Ecnext|website=goliath.ecnext.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2072/html/panorama.htm Iran Daily&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517161121/http://www.iran-daily.com/1383/2072/html/panorama.htm |date=2006-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snowskates''' are a type of snow sport equipment intended to allow the user to emulate the actions of [[ice skating]] or [[rollerblading]] on snow. They were first produced commercially in [[Germany]] in the 1930s.

Snowskates consist of a pair of flexible ski boots with integrated bases resembling [[sled]] runners that are approximately the same length as the boot itself, incorporating steel edges to grip the snow.
[[File:Sleddogs snowskates Oslo, Norway.jpg|alt=Sleddogs snowskates Oslo, Norway|thumb|Sleddogs snowskates Oslo, Norway]]

Sled Dogs Snowskates is a winter sports company that is now owned and operated out of Oslo, Norway producing the current generation of snowskates. Since 2014, Sled Dogs Snowskates have produced a range of comfortable, lightweight snowskates for different user requirements (casual user to advanced user) Sled Dogs Snowskates combine the freedom and aggressive movements from inline skates and ice skates, with the freedom and challenge of slalom and snowboarding, without moving away from the key concept of 'Skates on Snow'.

''The similar term '''[[snowskating]]''' may also apply to a skateboard for use on snow (which is a shortened term of "snowskateboarding").''

Snowskates were invented in [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], and originally consisted of a simple wood runner that was tied to the users boots around 1865.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iceskatesmuseum.com/e-byz-sneeuw.htm|title=Snow skates|work=The virtual ice skates museum|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest versions came in many varieties and they were mostly custom-made as opposed to commercially produced. The more well-known, commercially produced models came from [[Germany]] in the 1950s. The modern version of snowskates was invented by Swiss inventor Hanes Jacob in the 1970s.

== Types and distributors of Sled Dogs brand snowskates ==
[[File:Available SledDogs snowskates types in season 2015-2016.jpg|alt=Available SledDogs snowskates types in season 2015–2016|thumb|493x493px|Available Sled Dogs snowskates types in season 2015–2016]]
Multiple types of snowskates and accessories are available at the official website and at the official distributors in more than 30 countries around the World.

In 2017 there are distributors in Europe, Russia, Cyprus, Australia and New Zealand, China, South Korea, Canada, USA and in South America.

The available models are named after Norwegian dog breeds: The Halden is the entry-level model claiming 'all-round practicality and performance; the Lunde is a special women's fit with a fleece inner lining; the Hygen is the racing model. The K9.02 model is the top model designed for freestyle and professional level users.

== TV appearances ==
The skates were featured in British [[Channel 4]] TVs show  "[[The Jump]]" where celebrities ([[Steve-O]], [[Dean Cain]], [[Heather Mills]], [[Brian McFadden]], [[Stacey Solomon]] etc.) were competing with SledDogs snowskates in series 2 in 2015 and in series 3 in 2016. Both series were watched by over 2,5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vs2yFZO-zk&amp;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luca Dallago - First World Champion of SledDogs Bonefight series.jpg|thumb|SledDogs Bonefight World Champion 2015-216 Luca Dallago]]
The first ever cross downhill competition using snowskates, called SledDogs Bonefight was held in [[Wagrain]], Austria on the 20th of December, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://sleddogsbonefight.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwDLBLdHxZ8&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by 2 more races during the winter season of 2015–16. The next race was held in the biggest indoor ski slope of the World in Snowworld, Landgraaf, The Netherlands followed by the third race in Red Deer, Canada. The first ever SledDogs Bonefight World Champion was Luca Dallago who is also a top 10 athlete in [[Crashed Ice|RedBull Crashed Ice]] series.

The 2016/17 Bonefight tournament was held at slopes in Atholville and Nakiska in Canada and Wagrain in Austria. The World Champion in the women's tournament was jointly held by Karine Roy and Makara Martin, both from Canada, with Shaelyn Moltzahn, also from Canada, making up the top three. In the men's tournament, Luca Dallego from Austria held on to his world title for a second year, with Nathan Oostenbrink from Canada and Philipp Auerswald from Germany sharing second place.

The 2017/18 Bonefight tournament returned to Atholville and Wagrain and debuted at the Iceland Winter Games in Akureyri. Germany's Philipp Auerswald beat former title-holder Luca Dallago to the top spot in the men's event, with Canada's Samuel Nadeau taking third. Canada's Karine Roy took the No.1 spot for the women, followed by Iceland's Eva Maria Karvelsdottir and Finland's Miisa Klemola. The Freestyle Jump title was closely fought between Canada's Vincent Leblanc and Iceland's Isak Andri Bjarnason, with the title ultimately going to Bjarnason following a technical tie and an audience vote.

'''Traveline''' is a [[public transport route planner]] service provided by a partnership between local authorities and transport operators in the UK to provide impartial and comprehensive information about public transport which has operated since 2000.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveline.org.uk/aboutTL.htm|title=What is traveline?|publisher=Traveline|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It prepares comprehensive public transport data for the UK and provides a number of regional public transport journey planners.&lt;ref name=pti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pti.org.uk/|title=Traveline Data|work=PTI|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Transport Direct}}
Following on from a successful prototype one number travel service developed by Lancashire County Council in 1999, the national Traveline organisation was established in 2000.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinedata.org.uk/history.htm|title=History|publisher=Traveline|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prototype national door-to-door journey for [[Great Britain]] (i.e. UK without [[Northern Ireland]]) using the Lancashire Traveline model for regional journey planners was available for evaluation by 'stakeholders and key opinion formers' by November 2003 and the service was officially launched by [[Alistair Darling]], the then [[Secretary of State for Transport]] on 31 December 2004.&lt;ref name=TDhist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportdirect/about/history|title=History and strategy|accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010 [[Gordon Brown]], the then [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] announced that the [[NaPTAN]] dataset would be released as [[Open Data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://number10.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-transcripts/2010/03/speech-on-building-britains-digital-future-22897|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100511083615/number10.gov.uk/news/speeches-and-transcripts/2010/03/speech-on-building-britains-digital-future-22897|dead-url=yes|archive-date=11 May 2010|title=Speech on Building Britain’s Digital Future|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
{{update section|date=December 2016}}

The Traveline regions assemble the public transport information within their areas and make it available through a number of local public transport journey planners. As of May 2014, all regions provide information for use within the [[Google Maps]] journey planner, and as of December 2016 all regions were added to the [[Apple Maps]] journey planner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url =http://www.macrumors.com/2016/12/19/apple-maps-transit-united-kingdom/ |publisher =MacRumors |access-date =19 December 2016 |date =19 December 2016 |author =Rossignol, J. |title =Apple Maps Expands Transit Directions Across the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details of all bus stops in the country are assembled into the [[NaPTAN|National Public Transport Access Nodes database (NaPTAN)]] which is updated daily. The organisation also maintains the associated National Public Transport Gazetteer of all place names, both formal and informal, that may be used to indicate the destination for a requested journey. These datasets are provided to both [[Google Maps]] and [[OpenStreetMap]]. They have also been released as [[Open Data]] via [[data.gov.uk]]. 

Public transport schedules are provided for use with the [[Transport Direct Portal]] on a weekly basis for use within the 'national journey planner for Great Britain'.&lt;ref name=pti/&gt;

Once a year all the schedules for the county by all modes (including the information collected and maintained by Traveline) is assembled into the [[National Public Transport Data Repository]] which is prepared every October is used for the creation of Core Accessibility Indicators for every part of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pti.org.uk/docs/NPTDRspec.doc|title=National Public Transport Data Repository|work=PTI|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data is also used within products such as [[MySociety]]'s [[Mapumental]].

Some bus operators provide information via the Electronic Bus Service Registration (EBSR) system using the [[TransXChange]] when passing information between operators, [[Vehicle and Operator Services Agency]] (VOSA), Traveline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/vosa/newsandevents/pressreleases/2008pressreleases/01-02-08newbusregistrationsystemtoimprovereal-timeinformationforpassengers.htm|title=01-02-08 New bus registration system to improve real-time information for passengers|publisher=Department for Transport|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational structure==
For operational and data preparation purposes the UK is divided in the following regions/nations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveline.org.uk/index.htm|title=Public Transport Information|publisher=Traveline|accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries are not identical to the [[Regions of England]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">A '''water-jet printer''' (or '''waterjet printer''') is a [[printer (computing)|printer]] that makes use of [[paper]] coated with special [[dye]]s and [[ink cartridge]]s filled with water to print paper copies of documents.&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lan Sheng|title=Hydrochromic molecular switches for water-jet rewritable paper|journal=Nature Communications|date=28 January 2014|volume=5|doi=10.1038/ncomms4044 |display-authors=etal|pmid=24472877|page=3044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using paper treated with [[oxazolidine]], the water jet changes the colour of the chemical to produce a print which fades in about a day, depending on [[temperature]], and the paper can be re-used rather than being disposed of. The print fades away within about 22 hours at temperatures below 35 degrees [[Celsius]] (95 degrees [[Fahrenheit]]) as the water [[evaporation|evaporates]].  While the chemical treatment makes the paper slightly more expensive, use of water instead of ink in the printer makes it much cheaper overall,  and the only change needed to the printer is to replace what's in the cartridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemists unveil 'water-jet' printer|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-chemists-unveil-water-jet-printer.html|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[technology]] for water-jet printing was developed by a team of Chinese scientists led by Sean Xiao-An Zhang, a [[chemistry]] [[professor]] at [[Jilin University]] in [[China]].&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

To create rewritable paper the researchers used four [[oxazolidine]]s. Some of the [[isomer]]s of these oxazolidines are colourless in the absence of water. But when the paper is wetted the water changes the dyes’ absorption of visible light. The exact [[wavelength]]s absorbed vary with the compound used, which allows printing in a variety of colours. The rewriteable paper was made by first coating ordinary paper with a layer of [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG) to prevent it reacting with the dye, before a second layer of PEG containing the chosen dye was laid on top. Finally, another layer of PEG was added to prevent the dye absorbing water from the air or, conversely, losing water too quickly. The team used a commercial inkjet printer and a cartridge filled with water to print trial documents.  The printed page is dry to the touch and the print can be rapidly ‘erased’ by heating it to 70&amp;nbsp;°C. The print remained legible for around 22 hours before evaporation wiped the page clean. Paper prepared in this way can be printed on and then erased more than 50 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tim Wogan|title='Waterjet' printer set to make a splash|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/01/waterjet-printer-rewriteable-paper-set-make-splash|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WebCT''' (Course Tools) or '''Blackboard Learning System''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackboard.com/&lt;/ref&gt; now owned by [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]], is an [[online]] [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[virtual learning environment]] system that is licensed to colleges and other institutions and used in many [[campus]]es for [[e-learning]].  To their WebCT courses, instructors can add such tools as discussion boards, mail systems, and live chat, along with content including documents and web pages. The latest versions of this software are now called Webcourses. WebCT is significant in that it was the world's first widely successful course management system for higher education. At its height, it was in use by over 10 million students in 80 countries.&lt;ref name=goldberg/&gt;

==Background==
WebCT was originally developed at the [[University of British Columbia]] by a faculty member in computer science, [[Murray Goldberg]]. Goldberg is also the creator of Silicon Chalk (sold to Wimba&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/224250/horizon_wimba_acquires_silicon_chalk/index.html Horizon Wimba Acquires Silicon Chalk]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.wimba.com (website)]) and Brainify [https://web.archive.org/web/20090204164850/http://brainify.com/ (website)] an academic social bookmarking and networking site. In 1995, Goldberg began looking at the application of web-based systems to education.&lt;ref name="goldberg"&gt;[http://news.ubc.ca/ubcnewsdigest/2004/04oct15.html#4 UBC Computer Scientist Wins $100,000 Award for Popular Course Software, University of British Columbia News &amp; Events, September 29, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; His research showed that student satisfaction and academic performance could be improved through the use of a web-based educational resource, or web-based course tools (from which the name WebCT is derived).{Goldberg, M., Salari, S. &amp; Swoboda, P. (1996) ‘World Wide Web – Course Tool: An Environment for Building WWW-Based Courses’ Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 28:7-11 pp1219-1231} In order to continue his research, he decided to build a system to ease the creation of web-based learning environments. This led to the first version of WebCT in early 1996, first presented at the 5th international World Wide Web conference in Paris during the spring of 1996. 

In 1997, Goldberg created a company, WebCT Educational Technologies Corporation, a spinoff company of UBC.{{deadlink|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref name=goldberg/&gt; Goldberg grew the company until 1999, at which point it served approximately 2-3 million students in 30 countries. In mid-1999, WebCT was acquired by ULT (Universal Learning Technology),{{deadlink|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref name=goldberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120710183128/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1999_May_17/ai_54643876 Universal Learning Technology  Acquires WebCT, Business Wire, May 17, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; a Boston-based company headed by Carol Vallone. Ms. Vallone continued to grow the company to the point where its product was used by over 10 million students in 80 countries.{{deadlink|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref name=goldberg/&gt; Goldberg resigned from his position of Canadian president of WebCT in 2002. In February 2006, WebCT was acquired by rival [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]] Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170418165057/https://magic.piktochart.com/output/21792118-aolaim-smtp-settings-mail-not-working-troubleshooting-usuk Aol Mail not working]&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the acquisition terms with Blackboard, the WebCT name will be phased out in favor of the Blackboard brand. The majority of WebCT users moved away from Blackboard LMS. Many selected an open source LMS.&lt;ref&gt;http://listedtech.com/webct-and-how-it-helped-open-source/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textbooks and publishing==
The software was used in [[electronic publishing]]. In order to use a [[textbook]] or other learning tool published in the WebCT format, some publishers require the student to purchase a [[password]] at the bookstore or to obtain it online. The software permitted integration of material prepared locally with material purchased from publishers.

==Criticisms==

WebCT's user interface has been criticized as needlessly complex and unintuitive. The "[[WebCT Vista|Vista]]" version of the product represented an attempt to derive balance between flexibility and ease of use, however it has also been the target of ease-of-use criticisms.

Some WebCT criticisms which were apparent include problems using it in multiple tabs or browser windows, heavy reliance on [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for its user experience,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116051757/http://clt.lse.ac.uk/Help/VLE-Pilot/WebCT-6-Java-Install.php WebCT Java Problems, Centre for Learning Technology, London School of Economics and Science 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; usage of too many browser [[HTML element#Frames|framesets]], issues with some features requiring pop-up blockers to be turned off, and problems using standard browser navigation tools (i.e. the Back and Forward commands).

WebCT, like most of its competitors, does not meet all guidelines for accessibility; these include, but are not limited to, the following studies:

'''Zoë Tiberius Quinn'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |last=Quinn |first=Zoë |user=UnburntWitch |number=580790835530219520 |date=March 25, 2015 |accessdate=August 18, 2016 |title=Y'all thought i was playin about my middle name}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1987) is an American [[video game developer]], [[video game programmer|programmer]], writer, and artist. She developed the [[interactive fiction]] game ''[[Depression Quest]]'', which was released in 2013. In 2014, a blog post by her ex-boyfriend sparked the [[Gamergate controversy]], in which Quinn was subjected to extensive harassment.

== Early life ==
Zoë Tiberius Quinn was born in 1987 and grew up in a small town near the [[Adirondack Mountains]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2015/04/28/gamergate/3/ |title=Game of Fear |website=[[Boston Magazine]] |date=April 28, 2015 |accessdate=May 14, 2015 |first=Zachary |last=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growing up, she often played [[video games]]. A favorite of hers was ''[[Commander Keen]]'', an [[MS-DOS]] game featuring an eight-year-old [[protagonist]] who builds a spaceship with items found around his house and then travels the Galaxy defending the Earth. As a teenager, she suffered from depression and was diagnosed with the condition at the age of 14. She has described receiving little sympathy or assistance from [[school district]] officials and says they were "less than understanding about teens with depression and suicide issues".&lt;ref name="NewYorker"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/zoe-quinns-depression-quest |title=Zoe Quinn's Depression Quest |last=Parkin |first=Simon |website=The New Yorker |date=September 9, 2014 |accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
At the age of 24, Quinn moved to Canada and made her first foray into video game programming. Her first game was the result of a six-week course on video game creation that she attended after seeing an advertisement in a newspaper. In a later interview for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', she said, "I felt like I'd found my calling."&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt;

=== ''Depression Quest'' ===
{{Main|Depression Quest}}
One of Quinn's earliest creative works, ''[[Depression Quest]]'', was conceived as a "choose-your-own path" adventure detailing the troubled life of a person suffering from depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge-online.com/news/why-the-co-creator-of-depression-quest-is-fighting-back-against-internet-trolls/ |title=Why the co-creator of Depression Quest is fighting back against Internet trolls |author=&lt;!-- Staff writers --&gt; |date=January 23, 2014 |website=Edge |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028002907/http://www.edge-online.com/news/why-the-co-creator-of-depression-quest-is-fighting-back-against-internet-trolls/ |archivedate=October 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many of the "correct" paths blocked due to the protagonists' struggle with mental self-care. Quinn thought this sort of game narrative would be a good way to depict depression, imposing a set of rules on players they might not experience in their day-to-day lives. ''Depression Quest'' was released in February 2013.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2014/08/13/depression-quest-now-available-steam |title='Depression Quest' Now Available on Steam |date=August 13, 2014 |website=Game Politics |accessdate=August 23, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528222556/http://gamepolitics.com/2014/08/13/depression-quest-now-available-steam/ |archivedate=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quinn attempted to publish the game on [[Steam Greenlight]] service twice&amp;nbsp;— in December 2013 and later in August 2014, when it was accepted and released by Steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Depression Quest Now Available on Steam for Free |url=https://www.ausgamers.com/news/read/3465218/depression-quest-now-available-on-steam-for-free |website=AusGamers |accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Depression Quest'' was featured in a ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' article as one of several video games dealing with the subjective experience of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rougeau |first1=Mike |title=Resistance is Futile: The New Wave of Video Games about Depression |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/video-games-about-depression |website=[[Playboy.com]] |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other projects ===
Quinn created the Game Developer Help List, designed to bring experienced game developers and novice developers into contact with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wawro |first=Alex |title=Game Developer Help List rallies industry vets to aid rookie devs |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/207278/Game_Developer_Help_List_rallies_industry_vets_to_aid_rookie_devs.php |website=Gamasutra |date=December 18, 2013 |accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she was intended to be part of the canceled [[YouTube]] reality television show codenamed "Game_Jam", which was meant to bring together a number of prominent indie game developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |title=Game jam reality show cancelled as indies wouldn't put up with its s*** |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-01-game-jam-reality-show-cancelled-as-indies-wouldnt-put-up-with-its-s |website=Eurogamer |date=April 1, 2014 |accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Quinn wrote a chapter for ''Videogames for Humans'', a book about games made using the [[Twine (software)|Twine]] tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Joseph |first1=Daniel |title=What's a Twine Game?

=== Harassment and Gamergate ===
{{Main|Gamergate controversy}}
In August 2014, Eron Gjoni, a former boyfriend of Quinn, posted a lengthy blog post detailing his relationship with Quinn. Based on the contents of the post, Quinn was falsely accused of receiving positive coverage from a journalist with whom she was in a relationship. It was later shown that the journalist in question had only once briefly mentioned Quinn's work, and not while they were in a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/11180510/gamergate-misogynist-felicia-day-zoe-quinn-brianna-wu.html |title=#GamerGate: the misogynist movement blighting the video games industry |last=Stuart |first=Bob |date=October 24, 2014 |website=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Parkin |first=Simon |url=https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/gamergate-scandal-erupts-video-game-community |title=Gamergate: A Scandal Erupts in the Video-Game Community |website=[[The New Yorker]] |date=October 17, 2014 |accessdate=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accusations sparked the Gamergate controversy. Quinn suffered a long period of harassment including [[doxing]], rape threats, and death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heron |first1=Michael James |last2=Belford |first2=Pauline |last3=Goker |first3=Ayse |title=Sexism in the circuitry |journal=ACM SIGCAS Computers and Society |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |volume=44 |issue=4 |year=2014 |pages=18–29 |issn=0095-2737 |doi=10.1145/2695577.2695582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harassment associated with Gamergate resulted in widespread recognition of sexism in gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/fed-up-game-developers-sign-open-letter-2014-9 |title=Game Developers Are Finally Stepping Up To Change Their Hate-Filled Industry |first1=Karyne |last1=Levy |website=[[Business Insider]] |date=September 2, 2014 |accessdate=September 7, 2014 |quote=The game industry has been in the spotlight for the past week, with several incidents of harassment and sexism making headlines.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/12/with-gamergate-the-video-game-industrys-growing-pains-go-viral/ |title=With #GamerGate, the video-game industry's growing pains go viral |first=Sarah |last=Kaplan |date=September 12, 2014 |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |website=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New Yorker'', the harassment escalated to the point where Quinn, "fearing for her safety, chose to leave her home" and began working with the authorities to identify those responsible for the harassment.&lt;ref name="NewYorker" /&gt; She detailed the experience in an interview on [[MSNBC]]'s ''[[Ronan Farrow Daily]],'' saying that Gamergate represented a rapidly shrinking fringe among an increasingly diverse gaming community and those attacking Quinn and other women in gaming needed "to just grow up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Exclusive: Woman who sparked Gamergate |series=[[Ronan Farrow Daily]] |station=[[MSNBC.com]] |url=https://www.msnbc.com/ronan-farrow-daily/watch/exclusive--woman-who-sparked-gamergate-345327171549 |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |date=October 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking with [[BBC News]], Quinn said the harassment had consumed her life, leading her to feel as if "surrounded by nothing but hate&amp;nbsp;— it's virulent, it's everywhere" and that she was "just trying to survive". The attacks boiled down to "the same accusation everybody makes toward every successful woman: she got to where she is because she had sex with someone" and she also pointed out that Gamergate had targeted "the people with the least power in the industry".
