{{Criminal defenses}}

'''Actual innocence''', also known as '''plain error''', is a special [[standard of review]] in [[legal case]]s to prove that a charged [[defendant]] did not commit the [[crime]](s) that he or she is accused of, which is often applied by [[appellate court]]s to prevent a [[miscarriage of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;See generally ''[[United States v. Olano]]'', [https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-olano#p736 507 U.S. 725], 736 (1993) ("In our collateral review jurisprudence, the term '[[miscarriage of justice]]' means that the defendant is actually innocent.... The [[United States courts of appeals|court of appeals]] should no doubt correct a plain forfeited error that causes the conviction or sentencing of an actually innocent defendant....") (citations omitted); ''[[Henderson v. United States (2013)|Henderson v.

==Overview of claims of "actual innocence"==
In its most literal sense, "actual innocence"—more properly understood as a claim that the prosecution has failed to prove factual guilt beyond a reasonable doubt—is a very commonly raised defense to a crime.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bergman, Sara J. Berman-Barrett, ''The Criminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive the System'' (2007), p. 285 (stating "Undoubtedly, the most common defense
argument is that the prosecution has failed to prove the defendant guilty").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Gardner, Victor Manian, ''Criminal Law: Principles, Cases, and Readings'' (1975), p. 123 (stating "The most common defense to a criminal charge is that of denying that the defendant committed the offense").&lt;/ref&gt; Claims of actual innocence may involve disputing that any crime occurred at all, or that the accused was the perpetrator of the criminal act. Arguably, even affirmative defenses such as "self-defense", insanity, or "mistake of fact" qualify as "actual innocence" claims because while in those cases the accused admits to both his or her identity as the actor and to the existence of the act ("[[actus reus]]"), he or she is claiming that the State cannot prove that he or she had the requisite mental state ("[[mens rea]]") to constitute a crime.

However, the specific term "actual innocence" is most often used in the context of someone convicted for a crime he or she did not commit. Claims of "actual innocence" are, in that sense, usually raised in post-conviction challenges to a conviction. The Tarlton [[Law Library]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] maintains an "Actual Innocence awareness database" containing "resources pertaining to wrongful convictions, selected from the popular media (such as newspaper articles and segments which aired on television news magazines), journal articles, books, reports, legislation and websites".

In the United States, establishing "actual innocence" after a conviction may be considerably more difficult than winning an acquittal at trial, however. At trial, the defendant enjoys a due process right to the presumption of innocence, and the State is obligated to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., ''Cochran v. United States'', 157 U.S. 286, 299 (1895). However, "innocence" is a factual question, and once a fact-finder—judge or jury—makes a factual determination, appellate and post-conviction courts generally are bound by those factual determinations. Appeals and post-conviction cases, by their very nature, focus on legal errors, not factual disputes. Indeed, it is unclear whether proof of actual innocence is, in and of itself, grounds for appellate reversal. ''[[Herrera v. Collins]]'', 506 U.S. 390 (1993)

A convicted person has two avenues for attacking the validity of his or her conviction and/or sentence. The first is direct appeal. Direct appeals are limited in number and scope, and address only those issues raised in the lower court. The second method of attacking the validity of a conviction is known as "collateral" review, and can take many forms, including state and federal petitions for writs of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], petitions for writs of error [[coram nobis]], and—increasingly—a newly developed form of collateral relief which allows petitioners to raise claims of actual innocence, whether through DNA testing or through some other method. Thus, it is in collateral, post-conviction filings that claims of actual innocence are most likely to be considered.

==The typical innocence defense==
Because the [[prosecution]] must prove guilt [[Legal burden of proof|beyond a reasonable doubt]], a defendant asserting actual innocence need only raise a reasonable doubt as to whether they were the person who committed a particular crime, or whether the acts that they committed amount to the commission of a crime. In point of fact, the defendant is not obliged to present a defense at all.

Examples of an actual innocence defense include:
*[[Alibi]] – the defendant will present evidence of having been in a different location at the time the act occurred, thereby making it impossible for the defendant to have committed the crime.
*[[Mistaken identity]] – although the prosecution bears the burden of proving that a defendant has been properly identified, the defendant may still need to call into question the memory and/or credibility of [[witness]]es claiming to have seen the commission of the crime. Alibi and/or mistaken identity defenses constitute "agency" defense—an argument that the accused is not the criminal agent.
*[[Frameup]] – the defendant will assert that [[falsification of evidence]] has resulted in the creation of a meritless case against him or her, usually by the [[police]] or similar persons of authority with access to the [[crime scene]], or by private parties hoping to profit from the defendant's misfortune. If the prosecution is relying on the defendant's confession, the defendant may assert that a [[false confession]] was extracted through coercive means.

Many celebrated criminal cases have rested solely on the defense that the defendant did not commit the crime—for example, [[O.J. Simpson]], [[Robert Blake (actor)|Robert Blake]], and [[Michael Jackson]] all claimed that they simply had not committed the acts charged. By contrast, defendants such as [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], [[Susan Smith]], and [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt]] conceded that they committed the criminal act, but raised defenses such as insanity or diminished capacity. Other defendants, such as [[George Zimmerman]], conceded that the act was committed, but asserted that it was justified, and therefore not a crime.

== "Actual innocence" pleas in post-conviction collateral proceedings ==
Because most forms of [[post-conviction collateral relief]] are limited to procedural or Constitutional flaws in the trial itself, claims of "actual innocence" generally are recognized only in those states which have adopted specific "actual innocence" statutes.  Otherwise, in order to obtain post-conviction collateral relief, a defendant must often plead a specific statutory grounds for relief, i.e., that the conviction was obtained in violation of the Constitution of the United States. In jurisdictions that restrict a court's power to hear a post-conviction petition to a time period defined by statute, the court cannot grant post-conviction relief upon expiration of the time period regardless of the discovery of proof of "actual innocence" of the crime for which he was convicted. The jurisdictional bar is often rationalized by citing the requirement of [[finality (law)|finality]] of the judicial process in order to maintain the integrity of the system. While some argue that this is unjust for the convicted, it is rationalized that continued specter of "actual innocence" after the conclusion of a trial would make the [[adjudication]] process moot, which may lead to [[rule of law]] problems.

In the United States, this tradition has been heavily revised. As DNA testing grew more sophisticated, every state adopted statutes or rules allowing newly discovered DNA results to form the basis of a challenge to a conviction on grounds of "actual innocence". The scope and breadth of an inmate's ability to bring a DNA-based claim of actual innocence varies greatly from state to state.  The Supreme Court has ruled that convicted persons do not have a constitutional due process right to bring DNA-based post-conviction "actual innocence" claims. ''[[District Attorney's Office v. Osborne]]'', 557 U.S. 52 (2009). Thus, the way such claims are handled may vary greatly from one jurisdiction to the next.

Following reports of a sizable number of DNA-based exonerations, some states also have adopted broader "actual innocence" statutes allowing post-conviction challenges on the basis of newly discovered evidence in general.  The Commonwealth of Virginia adopted such a law in 2004, subjecting petitioners to a very high standard of proof to overturn a conviction:   that "the previously unknown or unavailable evidence is material and, when considered with all of the other evidence in the current record, will prove that no rational trier of fact would have found proof of guilt or delinquency beyond a reasonable doubt." Va. Code Ann. § 19.2-327.11. Upon the presentation of such evidence, the Virginia Court of Appeals (its intermediate appellate court) may reverse the conviction.  In 2009 the State of Maryland adopted a law with a significantly lower standard:  the new evidence must "create[] a substantial or significant possibility that the result may have been different[.]" Md. Code Ann., Crim. Pro. Art. §8-301. However, the Maryland law allows for a retrial rather than a summary reversal.  The State of Utah has adopted an actual innocence statute.  The legislatures of Wyoming and Missouri were considering similar laws in 2013.

Even in those jurisdictions without formal "actual innocence" provisions in their post-conviction statutes, actual innocence can have a procedural effect, in that it will excuse procedural default and permit the filing of a successor collateral relief petition.  This is based on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ''[[Schlup v. Delo]]'', [[Case citation|513 U.S. 298]] (1995){{ref|citation}}, in which a death row inmate filed a second federal habeas corpus petition, asserting as substantive claims the claims that his trial lawyer had ineffectively failed to present alibi witnesses and that the Government had wrongly concealed exculpatory evidence.  Schlup also argued that he was actually innocent—not because that was a substantive ground for relief, but because his actual innocence excused his failure to raise his ineffective-counsel and prosecutorial-nondisclosure claims in his state court pleadings and in his first federal habeas petition.  Whether or not relief was to be granted, the ''Schlup'' Court held, depended on the merits of his ineffective counsel and prosecutorial nondisclosure claims.

==Pleading in the alternative==
Because [[alternative pleading|pleading in the alternative]] is generally permitted in criminal cases, a defendant may claim to have not committed the crime itself, but at the same time may claim that ''if'' the defendant had committed the crime, the act was excused for a reason such as insanity or intoxication, or was justified due to provocation or self-defense. Such claims are, for obvious reasons, difficult to present to juries, because they entail arguing both that the defendant did and did not commit the crime alleged.

==An English perspective==
Much of U.S. criminal law is derived from the English [[common law]], whose standard analysis is that (with the exception of strict liability offenses) a crime is made up of two parts: (i) the guilty act (''[[actus reus]]'') (ii) and the guilty intention (''[[mens rea]]'').  A court examines the issues in sequence since there is little point in establishing intent if the accused did not commit the act.  The court will convict only if the ''actus'' and the ''mens'' are shown [[beyond reasonable doubt]]. If convicted, the accused may contest either or both of the findings of ''actus'' or ''mens''.  England does not have the specific concept of "actual innocence" but the courts are concerned to ensure that an innocent person is not subject to a criminal penalty. The appeal process will not impose an onus of proof of "beyond reasonable doubt" to show innocence, but (even if the process takes years) a court will allow new evidence to be adduced if it tends to show that the accused did not (or could not) commit the crime. The [[United Kingdom]], like all 47 Member States of the [[Council of Europe]], is a signatory to the [[European Convention of Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and is prohibited by Article 3 from using the death penalty so there is no longer the fear that an innocent man may be executed. The case of prisoner [[Troy Davis case|Troy Davis]], executed 21 September 2011, illustrates the difficulties that a person has, once convicted, to prove his "actual innocence" in the U.S.

The '''Almedalen Week''' (''Almedalsveckan'', also known as Politician's Week in Almedalen, ''Politikerveckan i Almedalen'') is an annual event taking place in week 27 in and around [[Almedalen]], a park in the city of [[Visby]] on the Swedish island [[Gotland]].

With speeches, seminars and other political activities, it is considered to be the most important forum in [[Politics of Sweden|Swedish politics]]. During the week, representatives from the major [[List of political parties in Sweden|political parties in Sweden]] take turns to make speeches in Almedalen.

It has inspired similar events to be held in other countries, like [[Suomi-Areena]] in Finland, Arendalsveckan in Norway, [[Arvamusfestival]] in Estonia and [[Folkemødet]] at the island of [[Bornholm]] in Denmark.

== History ==

[[File:Olof Palme 1968.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Olof Palme speaking in 1968]]
The origin of the Almedalen Week was the speeches made by [[Olof Palme]] during several summers in Almedalen. He was in Visby because he and his family used to spend their summers at [[Fårö]]. It started with an improvised gathering that Palme, then [[education minister]] and candidate for the position of [[party leader]] for the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic party]], and another party leader candidate, [[Krister Wickman]] had on 25{{nbsp}}July 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Almedalsveckan 1968|trans-title=Almedalen Week 1968|url=http://www.helagotland.se/img/2008/6/30/3874339.pdf|website=www.helagotland.se|publisher=Gotlänningen, Gotlands Allehanda, Gotlands Folkblad|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palme made his speech from the back of a flatbed truck at [[Visby city wall#Towers, buildings, gates and parts of the Wall|Kruttornet]] by the Almedalen park. The audience was a couple of hundred people.&lt;ref name=historia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almedalsveckan.info/1009 |title=Almedalsveckans historia |trans-title=The history of Almedalen week |work=almedalsveckan.info |language=Swedish |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62JAs5Sa4?url=http://www.almedalsveckan.info/1009 |archivedate=9 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=9 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the origin of the Almedalen Week, Almedalen is sometimes nicknamed "Palmedalen".&lt;ref name=Palmedalen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonsson|first1=Gunnar|title=Almedalen blev Palmedalen|trans-title=Almedalen became Palmedalen|url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/almedalen-blev-palmedalen/|website=www.dn.se|publisher=[[Dagens Nyheter]]|date=5 July 2008|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official Almedalen Week took place in 1982, when the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] started to organise economic seminars. As a response, the other political parties started to take a more active part.&lt;ref name=historia /&gt; The first time all of the major party leaders were present was in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]]|title=Rusning till Almedalen|trans-title=Rushing for Almedalen|url=http://www.corren.se/ekonomi/rusning-till-almedalen-4457765.aspx|website=www.corren.se|date=4 July 2002|publisher=[[Östgöta Correspondenten]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 1980s, the week almost ceased to be. In the summer following the [[assassination of Olof Palme]] in 1986, only the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] and the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]]
were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melstedt|first1=Lillemor|last2=Hermansson|first2=Ralph|title=Ett gigantiskt minglande Palmedal|trans-title=A gigantic mingle in the Palmedalen|journal=Från riksdag &amp; departement|date=2006|volume=22|pages=12-13|url=http://libris.kb.se/bib/10639304|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the parties expressed that political speeches in Almedalen were too associated with Palme as a person. [[Ingvar Carlsson]], who became prime minister after Palme's death, said that he chose to hold his speeches at other locations in Visby during the following years out of respect for Palme. He only started speaking in Almedalen after having been persuaded to do so by Palme's widow, [[Lisbet Palme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melin|first1=Annika|title="Gotland och Visby ska vara stolta"|trans-title="Gotland and Visby should be proud"|url=http://www.helagotland.se/start/gotland-och-visby-ska-vara-stolta-5368757.aspx|publisher=www.helagotland.se|newspaper=[[Gotlands Tidningar]]|date=27 June 2009|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st century ==

[[File:Folk på Donners plats Almedalsveckan 2014 Visby.jpg|thumb|Mingling at Almedalen Week in 2014]]
In recent years, the event has grown larger, with hordes of journalists, lobbyists, local and national politicians, employees from local, regional and national organisations and representatives of [[non-governmental organization]]s all coming to Visby to meet, discuss politics and socialize. {{As of|2015}}, it is the biggest and most important forum in Sweden for seminars, debates and political speeches on current social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wendt|first1=Maria|title=Almedalen – ett nationalromantiskt spektakel|trans-title=The Almedalen Week – a spectacle in the spirit of national romanticism|url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/understrecket/almedalen-ett-nationalromantiskt-spektakel_3711736.svd|website=www.svd.se|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=6 July 2014|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, 3,513 activities were held, 866 journalists were accredited and over 30,000 participants were at the event.&lt;ref name=stat2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Uppdaterad statistik 2014|trans-title=Updated statistics 2014|url=http://www.almedalsveckan.info/24413|website=www.almedalsveckan.info|publisher=[[Gotland Municipality]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=7 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208001659/http://www.almedalsveckan.info/24413|archive-date=2015-02-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important factor is that all seminars are free of charge. The absolute majority of them are also open to everybody.

== Getting noticed ==

[[File:Gudrun eldar hundra tusen - och hettar upp debatten IMG 6403.jpg|thumb|Gudrun Schyman sets fire to money]]
With the increasing numbers of activities it has become more difficult for the individual participants to get noticed by spectators and the media. This has resulted in a number of spectacular actions during the years. In 2010, the spokesperson for the [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]], [[Gudrun Schyman]], [[Money burning|burned]] [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 100,000 during a speech about the inequality in wages for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Viktigt att synas i Almedalen|trans-title=Important to get noticed in Almedalen|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=3367&amp;artikel=3837568|website=www.sverigesradio.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|date=7 July 2010|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, actress [[Kim Anderzon]], artist [[Ernst Billgren]], musician [[Olle Ljungström]], among others, declared that a new party, the ''Kulturpartiet'' (the Cultural Party), had been created and that they were candidates for the Riksdag.
It was later declared that the party had been a elaborate hoax created by the [[Riksteatern]] to raise awareness for cultural issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Svensson|first1=Niklas|title=Kulturpartiet – en dyr bluff|trans-title=The Cultural Party – An expensive hoax|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/kulturpartiet---en-dyr-bluff/|website=www.expressen.se|publisher=[[Expressen]]|date=5 July 2005|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Political scientist Maria Wendt has criticized the Almedalen Week and states that it has clarified how much politics in Sweden have become dependent on media, and now conforms to the terms and tools of the press, TV, radio and websites. Wendt says that whereas earlier media would report what went on in politics, it is presently more common to have debates taking place in the media itself. The language and messages delivered by politicians are conformed to fit in the frames provided by TV and newspapers, making comments short, powerful and lacking in nuances. The Almedalen Week is an event where such shortcomings are becoming more visible, according to Wendt. She suggested that instead of dedicating each day to one of the parties, the days should be used to highlight specific issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stiernstedt|first1=Jenny|title="Almedalen ett enda medieutspel"|trans-title="The Almedalen Week, one big media gambit|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/almedalen-ett-enda-medieutspel_7316289.svd|website=www.svd.se|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=3 July 2012|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The event as a liminal phase ===

During the Almedalen Week journalists, politicians and lobbyists socialize in a way that under normal circumstances would not be considered correct. This has been compared to a [[Liminality|liminal phase]], a term used in [[social anthropology]] for when normal rules cease to apply for a short while, like during [[carnival]]s, after which everything returns to normal. What has previously been taboo, is allowed for a short while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=Medierna|title=Karnevalen i Almedalen|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2795&amp;artikel=5185228|website=www.sverigesradio.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|date=9 July 2012|language=Swedish||accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar events in other countries ==

Similar events have been held in Finland, Denmark and Norway. The Finnish event is called [[SuomiAreena]], started in 2006 in the city of [[Pori]]. The Danish event [[Folkemødet]] was started in 2011, on the [[Bornholm]] island. A Norwegian version of the week was held at [[Eidsvoll]]. The event was scheduled to take place in [[Arendal]] again in 2011, but was postponed because of the [[2011 Norway attacks]]. The event is now back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Succé i Norge för kopia av Almedalsveckan|trans-title=Success in Norway for a copy of the Almedalen week|url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=94&amp;artikel=5360935|website=www.sverigesradio.se|publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]]|language=Swedish |accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a South Korean delegation came to Visby to study the concept of the Almedalen Week. According to political scientist Yonhyok Choe, the island of [[Jeju Province|Jeju]] is a likely candidate for the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stiernstedt|first1=Jenny|title=Almedalen på export|trans-title=Exporting the Almedalen Week|url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/almedalen-pa-export_7310003.svd|website=www.svd.se|publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|date=29 June 2012|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Världen följer efter|trans-title=The world follows suit|url=http://www.almedalsveckan.info/7404|website=www.almedalsveckan.info|publisher=[[Gotland Municipality]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Arvamusfestival in Estonia was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Estonia – Civil society|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2014/estonia#.VNVJCWN0zIW|website=www.freedomhouse.org|publisher=[[Freedom House]]|accessdate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quote ==
Almedalen Week visitor [[Dennis Kucinich]] commented on the event:

{{quotation |When you see the kind of internecine conflict that happens in the [[United States]]— the partisan divide, the dichotomous thinking, the separation from each other—there is a different thing happening here in Sweden at Almedalen, which is a sense of a [[Group cohesiveness|common bond]] as [[Citizenship|citizens]] with a common purpose for the nation. And people come together here. And the thing that impresses me is how quickly on the street you can get into the deepest discussions that have consequence. And so, that’s why—you know, having been here only for two days, I’ve had a chance to meet people from every level of society, decision makers as well as citizens, and there’s a sense that things matter in these kind of discussions, which are direct, relatively low-key, nonconfrontational, matter-of-fact. And behind it is— what animates it is a sense of commitment to each other and to the nation.}}

In 2014, the Almedalen Week was profiled by the US program ''[[Democracy Now!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Almedalen Week: At Sweden’s One-of-a-Kind Festival, All Political Parties Gather in One Place| work = [[Democracy Now!]]| accessdate = 2014-07-03| date = 2014-07-02| url = http://www.democracynow.org/2014/7/2/dn_at_almedalen_week_at_swedens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2865">'''Anthony McKinney''' was a prisoner convicted of killing a security guard in 1978 in [[Harvey, Illinois]]. He was the subject of a [[Medill Innocence Project]] effort to reinvestigate his case and determine if he was wrongfully convicted. The case obtained notoriety after the Cook County state's attorney subpoenaed the [[Medill School of Journalism]] students' grades, class syllabus, and personal e-mails. This case is relevant to issues of [[Freedom of the Press]] because of the subpoena of journalism school class records as well as issues relating to possible [[wrongful conviction]].&lt;ref name="trib1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-nu-subpoena-19-oct19,0,3778012.story |title=Northwestern University's Medill Innocence Project is in a standoff with Cook County prosecutors |last=Long |first=Jeff |date=19 Oct 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune |accessdate=2009-10-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021090346/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-nu-subpoena-19-oct19%2C0%2C3778012.story |archivedate=21 October 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/northwestern-students-grades-subpoenaed-state-murder-investigation/Story?id=8870809&amp;page=1|title=Northwestern Students' Records Subpoenaed by Illinois State Attorney Office|last=Friedman|first=Emily|date=Oct 20, 2009|work=ABC News|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contempt hearing in wrongful conviction case delayed, Medill Reports, Northwestern University, Jun 24, 2010, http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=166922&amp;print=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Student journalists protection still unanswered: Arguments over subpoena continue in light of new evidence, McCormick Freedom Project, June 25, 2010, http://www.freedomproject.us/post-exchange/Article-Northwestern_student_journalists_protection_still_unanswered.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MUHAMMAD ALI BOUT COULD BE KEY TO CLEARING MAN OF MURDER THAT HE WAS CONVICTED OF 27 YEARS AGO, [[Chicago Sun Times]], November 20, 2008, archived:{{cite web|url=http://www.law.northwestern.edu/news/article_full.cfm?eventid%3D4000 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201030143/http://www.law.northwestern.edu/news/article_full.cfm?eventid=4000 |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:High Court of Karnataka, Bangalore MMK.jpg|thumb|420px|upright|The [[Karnataka High Court]] (High Court Building pictured) primarily hears appeals from subordinate courts in the [[Indian state]] of [[Karnataka]]]]
In [[law]], an '''appeal''' is the process in which cases are reviewed, where parties request a formal change to an official decision. Appeals function both as a process for error correction as well as a process of clarifying and interpreting law.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Keenan D. Kmiec, ''The Origin &amp; Current Meanings of "Judicial Activism"'', 92 {{smallcaps|Cal. L. Rev.}} 1441, 1442 (2004) (discussing contemporary discourse regarding judicial activism); Jonathan Mallamud, ''Prospective Limitation and the Rights of the Accused'', 56 {{smallcaps|Iowa L.Rev.}} 321, 359 (1970) ("the power of the courts to contribute to the growth of the law in keeping with the demands of society”); ''Realist Jurisprudence &amp; Prospective Overruling'', 109 {{smallcaps|U. Pa. L. Rev.}} 1, 6 (1960) (discussing appeals as “a deliberate and conscious technique of judicial lawmaking”).&lt;/ref&gt; Although appellate courts have existed for thousands of years, [[common law]] countries did not incorporate an affirmative right to appeal into their jurisprudence until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Keillor, ''Should Minnesota Recognize A State Constitutional Right to A Criminal Appeal?'', 36 {{smallcaps|Hamline L. Rev.}} 399, 402 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Appellate courts and other systems of error correction have existed for many millennia. During the first dynasty of Babylon, [[Hammurabi]] and his governors served as the highest appellate courts of the land.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph W. Dellapenna &amp; Joyeeta Gupta, {{smallcaps|The Evolution of the Law and Politics of Water}} 29 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient rome|Ancient Roman]] law employed a complex hierarchy of appellate courts, where some appeals would be heard by the [[roman emperor|emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Du Plessis, {{smallcaps|Borkowski's Textbook on Roman Law}} 82 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, appellate courts have existed in Japan since at least the [[Kamakura Shogunate]] (1185–1333 CE). During this time, the Shogunate established ''[[hikitsuke]]'', a high appellate court to aid the state in adjudicating lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;John Stewart Bowman, {{smallcaps|Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture}} 133 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eighteenth century, [[William Blackstone]] observed in his [[Commentaries on the Laws of England]] that appeals existed as a form of error correction in the [[common law]] during the reign of [[Edward III of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{smallcaps|Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England}}, [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk3ch25.asp//Book the Third - Chapter the Twenty-Fifth: Of Proceedings, In the Nature of Appeals].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some scholars argue that "the right to appeal is itself a substantive liberty interest",&lt;ref&gt;Gary Stein, ''Expanding as per the Process Rights of Indigent Litigants: Will Texaco Trickle Down?'', 61 {{smallcaps|N.Y.U.L. Rev.}} 463, 487-88 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of a right to appeal is a relatively recent advent in common law jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;See Peter D. Marshall, [http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=djcil ''A Comparative Analysis of the Right to Appeal''], 22 {{smallcaps|Duke J. of Comp. &amp; Int. L.}} 1, 1 (2011) ("The right to appeal is a comparatively recent addition to the common law criminal process.")&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, commentators have observed that common law jurisdictions were particularly "slow to incorporate a right to appeal into either its civil or criminal jurisprudence".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Keillor, ''Should Minnesota Recognize A State Constitutional Right to A Criminal Appeal?'', 36 {{smallcaps|Hamline L. Rev.}} 399, 402 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the United States first created a system of federal appellate courts in 1789,{{refn|[[Article III of the United States Constitution]] specifies that "The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish."&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. III, § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789, [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Congress created]] the first system of intermediate [[appellate courts]], known as [[United States circuit court|federal circuit courts]], which had appellate jurisdiction over certain matters decided by [[United States District Courts|District Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel John Meador and Jordana Simone Bernstein, {{smallcaps|Appellate Courts in the United States}} 7 (1994); Ruth A. Moyer, ''Disagreement About Disagreement: The Effect of A Circuit Split or "Other Circuit" Authority on the Availability of Federal Habeas Relief for State Convicts'', 82 {{smallcaps|U. Cin. L. Rev.}} 831, 836 (2014) (discussing history of federal circuit courts).&lt;/ref&gt; These federal circuit courts consisted of two justices from the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and one district court judge.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth A. Moyer, ''Disagreement About Disagreement: The Effect of A Circuit Split or "Other Circuit" Authority on the Availability of Federal Habeas Relief for State Convicts'', 82 {{smallcaps|U. Cin. L. Rev.}} 831, 836 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, Congress created the existing system of [[United States courts of appeals]], which hear appeals from United States district courts within limited geographic areas.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel John Meador and Jordana Simone Bernstein, ''Appellate Courts in the United States'' 7 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] hears appeals originating from United States district courts in [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Texas]]. Decisions in circuit courts are usually made by rotating three-judge panels chosen from judges sitting within that circuit, and circuit courts also occasionally  decide cases [[en banc]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur D. Hellman, ''"The Law of the Circuit" Revisited: What Role for Majority Rule?'', 32 {{smallcaps|S. Ill. U. L.J.}} 625 (2008); see also Fed. R. App. P. 35(a).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=fn}} but a federal right to appeal did not exist in the United States until 1889, when Congress passed the Judiciary Act to permit appeals in capital cases.&lt;ref&gt;Act of February 6, 1889, ch. 113, § 6, 25 Stat. 656, 656.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, the right to appeals was extended to other criminal cases, and the [[United States Courts of Appeals]] were established to review decisions from [[United States District Courts|district courts]].&lt;ref&gt;Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, § 5; 26 Stat. 826, 827-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states, such as [[Minnesota]], still do not formally recognize a right to criminal appeals.&lt;ref&gt;''Spann v. State'', 704 N.W.2d 486, 491 (Minn. 2005) (but noting that the right to at least one review by direct appeal or postconviction review has been recognized in Minnesota); Stan Keillor, ''Should Minnesota Recognize A State Constitutional Right to A Criminal Appeal?'', 36 {{smallcaps|Hamline L. Rev.}} 399, 401-02 (2013) ("[S]aying 'there is no constitutional right to appeal' in criminal cases is a shibboleth").&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.|source=—Associate Supreme Court Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]], discussing the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]' role as a court of last resort.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown v. Allen'', {{ussc|volume=344|page=443|pin=540|year=1953}} (Jackson, J., conc.).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although some courts permit appeals at preliminary stages of litigation, most litigants appeal final orders and judgments from lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca A. Cochran, ''Gaining Appellate Review by "Manufacturing" A Final Judgment Through Voluntary Dismissal of Peripheral Claims'', 48 {{smallcaps|Mercer L. Rev.}} 979, 979-80 (1997) (noting that in the United States, "[a]ppeals through rule 54(b),2 section 1292(b),&amp;nbsp;3 the collateral order doctrine, and other avenues have become increasingly limited"); see also Information Guide: [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/resources/edc/Court%20of%20Justice.pdf//The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)] (noting that the court has appellate jurisdiction over decisions of lower courts).&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental premise of many legal systems is that appellate courts review questions of law ''[[De novo review|de novo]]'', but appellate courts do not conduct independent fact-finding.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Lyn Bassett, ''"I Lost at Trial - in the Court of Appeals!": The Expanding Power of the Federal Appellate Courts to Reexamine Facts'', 38 ''Hous. L. Rev.'' 1129, 1130 (2001); see also ''Pullman-Standard v. Swint'', {{ussc|volume=456|page=273|pin=291|year=1982}} ("[Factfinding] is the basic responsibility of district courts, rather than appellate courts ...") (internal citations and quotations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, appellate courts will generally defer to the record established by the trial court, unless some error occurred during the fact-finding process.&lt;ref&gt;Debra Lyn Bassett, ''"I Lost at Trial - in the Court of Appeals!": The Expanding Power of the Federal Appellate Courts to Reexamine Facts'', 38 ''Hous. L. Rev.'' 1129, 1130 (2001); cf. Leon Green, {{smallcaps|Judge and Jury}} 270 (1930) ("[T]hose equally expansible and collapsible terms 'law' and 'fact' ... They are basic assumptions; irreducible minimums and the most comprehensive maximums at the same instant. They readily accommodate themselves to any meaning we desire to give them.")&lt;/ref&gt; Many jurisdictions provide a statutory or constitutional right for litigants to appeal adverse decisions.&lt;ref&gt;See Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c.59) (establishing a nearly unlimited right of appeal to the Lords in England and Wales); Act of February 6, 1889, ch. 113, § 6, 25 Stat. 656, 656 (establishing a statutory right to appeals in federal capital cases in the United States).&lt;/ref&gt; However, most jurisdictions also recognize that this right may be [[waiver|waived]]. In the United States, for example, litigants may waive the right to appeal, as long as the waiver is "considered and intelligent".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''United States v. Mendoza-Lopez'', {{ussc|volume=481|page=828|year=1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellate process usually begins when an appellate court grants a party's [[petition for review]] or [[petition for certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Sup. Ct. R. 10(a), available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150723141606/http://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf/ Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States (2013)].&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike trials, appeals are generally presented to a [[judge]], or a panel of judges, rather than a [[jury]].&lt;ref&gt;Debra Lyn Bassett, ''"I Lost at Trial - in the Court of Appeals!": The Expanding Power of the Federal Appellate Courts to Reexamine Facts'', 38 ''Hous. L. Rev.'' 1129, 1131 (2001) ("This established dichotomy between the responsibilities of the jury and those of the reviewing court resulted from the jury's revered position in our country's history.").&lt;/ref&gt; Before making any formal argument, parties will generally submit [[legal brief]]s in which the parties present their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Sup. Ct. R. 15, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150723141606/http://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf/ Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States (2013)].&lt;/ref&gt; Appellate courts may also grant permission for an ''amicus curiae'' to submit a brief in support of a particular party or position.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Sup. Ct. R. 37, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150723141606/http://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf/ Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States (2013)].&lt;/ref&gt; After submitting briefs, parties often have the opportunity to present an oral argument to a judge or panel of judges.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Sup. Ct. R. 28, available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20150723141606/http://www.supremecourt.gov/ctrules/2013RulesoftheCourt.pdf/ Rules of the Supreme Court of the United States (2013)].&lt;/ref&gt; During oral arguments, judges often ask question to attorneys to challenge their arguments or to advance their own legal theories.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Levien Shullman, ''The Illusion of Devil's Advocacy: How the Justices of the Supreme Court Foreshadow Their Decisions During Oral Argument'', 6 ''J. App. Prac. &amp; Process'' 271 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; After deliberating in chambers, appellate courts will issue formal opinions that resolve the legal issues presented for review.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Sup.

{{main|Appellate court}}

When considering cases on appeal, appellate courts generally affirm, reverse, or vacate the decision of a lower court.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Steinman, ''Appellate Courts as First Responders: The Constitutionality and Propriety of Appellate Courts' Resolving Issues in the First Instance'', 87 {{smallcaps|Notre Dame L. Rev.}} 1521, 1522 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts maintain a dual function, where they consider both appeals as well as matters of "first instance".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph D. Kearney &amp; Thomas W. Merrill, The Influence of Amicus Curiae Briefs on the Supreme Court, 148 U. Pa. L. Rev. 743, 837 n.6 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] primarily hears cases on appeal but retains original jurisdiction over a limited range of cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[James E. Pfander]], ''Rethinking the Supreme Court's Original Jurisdiction in State-Party Cases'', 82 Cal. L. Rev. 555, 555 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions maintain a system of intermediate appellate courts, which are subject to the review of higher appellate courts.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Steinman, ''Appellate Courts as First Responders: The Constitutionality and Propriety of Appellate Courts' Resolving Issues in the First Instance'', 87 ''Notre Dame L. Rev.'' 1521, 1542 (2012) (discussing role and function of intermediate appellate courts).&lt;/ref&gt; The highest appellate court in a jurisdiction is sometimes referred to as a "court of last resort".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory L. Acquaviva and John D. Castiglione, ''Judicial Diversity on State Supreme Courts'', 39 ''Seton Hall L. Rev.'' 1203, 1205 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biblioteca Nacional de España''' (''National Library of Spain'') is a major [[public library]], the largest in Spain, and one of the [[List of largest libraries|largest]] in the world. It is located in [[Madrid]], on the [[Paseo de Recoletos]].

== History ==
The library was founded by King [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] in 1712 as the Palace Public Library (Biblioteca Pública de Palacio). The Royal Letters Patent that he granted, the predecessor of the current legal deposit requirement, made it mandatory for printers to submit a copy of every book printed in Spain to the library. In 1836, the library's status as Crown property was revoked and ownership was transferred to the Ministry of Governance (Ministerio de la Gobernación). At the same time, it was renamed the Biblioteca Nacional.

During the 19th century, confiscations, purchases and donations enabled the Biblioteca Nacional to acquire the majority of the antique and valuable books that it currently holds. In 1892 the building was used to host the [[Historical American Exposition]].&lt;ref name="libraryused"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bne.es/en/LaBNE/Historia/Cronologia/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2017|title=Cronología. National Library of Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 1896, the Biblioteca Nacional opened to the public in the same building in which it is currently housed and included a vast Reading Room on the main floor designed to hold 320 readers. In 1931 the Reading Room was reorganised, providing it with a major collection of reference works, and the General Reading Room was created to cater for students, workers and general readers.

During the [[Spanish Civil War]] close to 500,000 volumes were collected by the Confiscation Committee (Junta de Incautación) and stored in the Biblioteca Nacional to safeguard works of art and books held until then in religious establishments, palaces and private houses. During the 20th century numerous modifications were made to the building to adapt its rooms and repositories to its constantly expanding collections, to the growing volume of material received following the modification to the [[Legal Deposit]] requirement in 1958, and to the numerous works purchased by the library. Among this building work, some of the most noteworthy changes were the alterations made in 1955 to triple the capacity of the library's repositories, and those started in 1986 and completed in 2000, which led to the creation of the new building in [[Alcalá de Henares]] and complete remodelling of the building on [[Paseo de Recoletos]], Madrid.

In 1986, when Spain's main bibliographic institutions - the National Newspaper Library (Hemeroteca Nacional), the Spanish Bibliographic Institute (Instituto Bibliográfico Hispánico) and the Centre for Documentary and Bibliographic Treasures (Centro del Tesoro Documental y Bibliográfico) - were incorporated into the Biblioteca Nacional, the library was established as the State Repository of Spain's Cultural Memory (Centro Estatal Depositario de la Memoria Cultural Española), making all of Spain's bibliographic output on any media available to the Spanish Library System and national and international researchers and cultural and educational institutions. In 1990 it was made an Autonomous Entity attached to the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (Spain)|Ministry of Culture]] (Ministerio de Cultura).

The Madrid premises are shared with the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|National Archaeological Museum]].

==The library today==
The Biblioteca Nacional is Spain's highest library institution and is head of the Spanish Library System.

As the country's national library, it is the centre responsible for identifying, preserving, conserving, and disseminating information about Spain's documentary heritage, and it aspires to be an essential point of reference for research into Spanish culture. In accordance with its Articles of Association, passed by Royal Decree 1581/1991 (R.D. 1581/1991) of October 31, 1991, its principal functions are to:

* Compile, catalogue, and conserve bibliographic archives produced in any language of the Spanish state, or any other language, for the purposes of research, culture, and information.
* Promote research through the study, loan, and reproduction of its bibliographic archive.
* Disseminate information on Spain's bibliographic output based on the entries received through the legal deposit requirement.

The library's collection consists of more than 26,000,000 items, including 15,000,000 books and other printed materials, 4,500,000 graphic materials, 600,000 sound recordings, 510,000 music scores, more than 500,000 microforms, 500,000 maps, 143,000 newspapers and serials, 90,000 audiovisuals, 90,000 electronic documents, and 30,000 manuscripts.

The current director of the Biblioteca Nacional is Ana Santos Aramburo, appointed in 2013. Former directors include her predecessors [[Glòria Pérez-Salmerón]] (2010–2013) and [[Milagros del Corral]] (2007-2010) as well as historian [[Juan Pablo Fusi]] (1996–2000) and author [[Rosa Regàs]] (2004–2007).

Given its role as the [[legal deposit]] for the whole of Spain, since 1991 it has kept most of the overflowing collection at a secondary site in [[Alcalá de Henares]], near [[Madrid]].

The Biblioteca Nacional provides access to its collections through the following library services:

* Guidance and general information on the institution and other libraries.
* Bibliographic information about its collection and those held by other libraries or library systems.
* Access to its automated catalogue, which currently contains close to 3,000,000 bibliographic records encompassing all of its collections.
* Archive consultation in the library's reading rooms.
* Interlibrary loans.
* Archive reproduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8155">'''Binding Corporate Rules''' or "BCRs" were developed by the [[European Union]] [[Article 29 Working Party]] to allow multinational [[corporation]]s, international organizations, and groups of companies to make intra-organizational transfers of personal data across borders in compliance with EU [[Data Protection Directive|Data Protection Law]]. The BCRs were developed as an alternative to the U.S. Department of Commerce EU [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|Safe Harbor]] (which was for US organizations only, but has been declared invalid and replaced by the [https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S Privacy Shield Frameworks]) and the [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en EU Model Contract Clauses].

BCRs are required to be approved by the [[national data protection authority|data protection authority]] in each EU Member State (such as the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] in the United Kingdom, [http://WWW.cnil.fr CNIL] in France, [http://www.agpd.es/portalwebAGPD/index-ides-idphp.php AEPD]  in Spain, etc.) in which the organization will rely on the BCRs. The EU has developed a mutual recognition process under which BCRs approved by one member state's data protection authority (known as the "lead" authority) and two other "co-lead" authorities, may be approved by the other relevant member states who may make comments and ask for amendments. Other members states, not part of mutual recognition process, will be also involved by the lead authority and will apply their own independent review process within a limited time-frame. The overall process for BCR acceptance takes usually between 6 and 9 months. This time frame does not include the required Data Protection setup, which should be already implemented within the company in order to comply with the current directive and its local implementation.

BCRs typically form stringent, intra-corporate global privacy policies, set of practices, processes and guidelines that satisfy EU standards and may be available as an alternative means of authorizing transfers of personal data (e.g., customer databases, HR information, etc.) outside of Europe.

BCRs should be seen as a framework for having different elements (internal legal agreement, policies, training, audit, etc.) providing compliance with EU data protection regulations and effective privacy and data protection.

It has to be noticed that, while originally designed for providing legal ground to international transfers, BCRs became de facto a corporation demonstration of its capacity to comply "at large" with personal data processing requirements. A corporation having BCRs applies this framework independently of international transfers and should be seen as part of the "Corporate Governance" or "Data Governance"

The Article 29 Working Party issued several guidance documents on BCR content, acceptance criteria and submission process.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/workinggroup/index_en.htm, ''see'' in particular documents WP 133, WP 153, WP 154, WP 155 at http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/workinggroup/wpdocs/2008_en.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

BCRs by themselves do not "authorize" all transfers automatically for all EU member states. Most of member states still require a formal "transfer notification" which is normally granted if the BCRs have been accepted by the relevant country.

The following companies have obtained authorizations for BCRs:&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, List of companies for which the EU BCR cooperation procedure is closed,http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/item-detail.cfm?item_id=613841&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomberg Law's web-based platform was first released under a pilot program in late 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg to Compete with Lexis and Westlaw |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |url=http://abovethelaw.com/2009/10/bloomberg-to-compete-with-lexis-and-westlaw/ |publisher=''[[Above the Law (blog)|Above the Law]]'' (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Financial Times]]'', "the unit forms part of the data provider's drive to diversify beyond the banks and investment groups that make up the core customers for its eponymous terminals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg Law's Discounts Pose Threat |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/6cd25406-fb11-11df-b576-00144feab49a.html#axzz2PPUndiBV |work = [[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the service was formally launched.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Prior to the creation of Bloomberg Law, two services, LexisNexis and Westlaw, comprised the majority of the legal research market. Bloomberg L.P. sought to separate itself from the competition by offering an integration of the Bloomberg company and financial data with legal research. Bloomberg Law combines content from Bloomberg’s global news network, legal analysis, court dockets, legal filings and reports from Bloomberg legal analysts as well as business news and information. Attorneys can also draw upon stock charts, search patent histories and find information about relevant judges and attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Can Bloomberg Law Compete With Westlaw and LexisNexis? |accessdate=August 4, 2011 |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/07/08/can-bloomberg-law-compete-with-westlaw-and-lexisnexis/?KEYWORDS=%22bloomberg+law%22 | work = [[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is priced to include all features under a fixed monthly fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bloomberg LP Lays Down the Law |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20101121/SUB/311219986 |work = [[Crain's New York Business]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colonel]] [[Dwight H. Sullivan]], [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]], was Chief Defense Counsel from 2005 to 2007.  The current Chief Defense Counsel is Brigadier General John Baker, USMC.

'''Clean-room design''' (also known as the [[Chinese wall#Computer science|Chinese wall]] technique) is the method of copying a design by [[reverse engineering]] and then recreating it without infringing any of the [[copyright]]s associated with the original design. Clean-room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against [[patent]]s, clean-room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions.

The term implies that the design team works in an environment that is "clean" or demonstrably uncontaminated by any knowledge of the proprietary techniques used by the competitor.

Typically, a clean-room design is done by having someone examine the system to be reimplemented and having this person write a specification. This specification is then reviewed by a lawyer to ensure that no copyrighted material is included. The specification is then implemented by a team with no connection to the original examiners.

== Examples ==

[[Phoenix Technologies]] sold its clean-room implementation of the IBM-compatible BIOS to various PC clone manufacturers.&lt;ref name="cleanroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/65532/Reverse_Engineering?pageNumber=1 |title=Reverse-Engineering |first=Mathew |last=Schwartz |date=2001-11-12 |accessdate=2013-06-23 |publisher=computerworld.com |quote=''To protect against charges of having simply (and illegally) copied IBM's BIOS, Phoenix reverse-engineered it using what's called a "clean room," or "Chinese wall," approach. First, a team of engineers studied the IBM BIOS—about 8KB of code—and described everything it did as completely as possible without using or referencing any actual code. Then Phoenix brought in a second team of programmers who had no prior knowledge of the IBM BIOS and had never seen its code. Working only from the first team's functional specifications, the second team wrote a new BIOS that operated as specified.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galler1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard A.

Several other PC clone companies, including [[Corona Data Systems]], [[Eagle Computer]], and Handwell Corporation, were successfully sued by IBM for copyright infringement in 1984, and were forced to re-implement their BIOS in a way which did not infringe IBM's copyrights.&lt;ref name=infoworld3&gt;{{Citation | last = Caruso | first = Denise | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = IBM Wins Disputes Over PC Copyrights | newspaper = InfoWorld | pages = 15 | date = February 27, 1984 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gy4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=ibm%20wins%20disputes%20over%20pc%20copyrights&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q=ibm%20wins%20disputes%20over%20pc%20copyrights&amp;f=false | accessdate = February 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/09/business/eagle-s-battle-for-survival.html|title=EAGLE'S BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL|first=David E.|last=Sanger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These 3 settlements happened before Phoenix announced in July of that year, that they were licensing their own BIOS code, expressly emphasizing the clean-room process through which Phoenix's BIOS code had been written by a programmer who did not even have prior exposure to Intel microprocessors, himself having been a [[Texas Instruments TMS9900|TMS9900]] programmer beforehand.&lt;ref name="Inc.1984"&gt;{{cite book|title=Phoenix Says Its BIOS May Foil IBM's Lawsuits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bwng8NJ5fesC&amp;pg=PA56|date=10 July 1984|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|page=56|issn=0888-8507}}&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the early 1990s, IBM was winning millions of dollars from settling BIOS copyright infringement lawsuits against some other PC clone manufacturers like Matsushita/[[Panasonic]] (1987)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Matsushita, IBM settle BIOS copyright infringement dispute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZ4AAehqfn0C&amp;pg=PA67|date=2 March 1987|publisher=Computerworld|pages=67|issn=0010-4841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kyocera]] (1993–1994), although the latter suit was for infringements between 1985 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/02/business/company-news-japanese-company-is-sued-by-ibm-over-copyrights.html|title=COMPANY NEWS; Japanese Company Is Sued By I.B.M.

Another clean-room design example is [[VTech]]'s successful clones of the [[Apple II]] [[Read-only memory|ROM]]s for the [[Laser 128]], the only computer model among dozens of Apple II compatibles which survived [[litigation]] brought by [[Apple Computer]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Case law ==
Clean room design is usually employed as best practice, but not strictly required by law. In ''[[NEC Corp. v Intel Corp.]]'' (1990), NEC sought [[declaratory judgment]] against Intel's charges that NEC's engineers simply copied the [[microcode]] of the [[8086]] processor in their [[NEC V20]] clone. A US judge ruled that while the early, internal revisions of NEC's microcode were indeed a copyright violation, the later one, which actually went into NEC's product, although derived from the former, were sufficiently different from the [[Intel microcode]] it could be considered free of copyright violations. While NEC themselves did not follow a strict clean room approach in the development of their clone's microcode, during the trial, they hired an independent contractor who was only given access to specifications but ended up writing code that had certain similarities to both NEC's and Intel's code. From this evidence, the judge concluded that similarity in certain routines was a matter of functional constraints resulting from the compatibility requirements, and thus were likely free of a creative element.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Contreras, Laura Handley, and Terrence Yang, "[http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v03/03HarvJLTech209.pdf NEC v. INTEL : BREAKING NEW GROUND IN THE LAW OF COPYRIGHT], ''Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology'', Volume 3, Spring Issue, 1990, pp. 209–222 (particularly p. 213)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the clean room approach had been used as preventative measure in view of possible litigation before (e.g. in the Phoenix BIOS case), the NEC v. Intel case was the first time that the clean room argument was accepted in a US court trial. A related aspect worth mentioning here is that NEC did have a license for Intel's patents governing the 8086 processor.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Elkins, “[http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1423&amp;context=jitpl NEC v. Intel: A Guide to Using "Clean Room" Procedures as Evidence]”, Computer Law Journal, vol. 4, issue  10, (Winter 1990) pp. 453–481&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc. v. Connectix Corporation]]'' was a 1999 lawsuit which established an important [[precedent]] in regard to reverse engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

Connectix Corporation]'', 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000).  Web Archive.org copy, Feb 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony]] sought damages for [[copyright infringement]] over [[Connectix]]'s [[Virtual Game Station]] emulator, alleging that its proprietary BIOS code had been copied into Connectix's product without permission. Sony won the initial judgment, but the ruling was overturned on appeal. Sony eventually purchased the rights to Virtual Game Station to prevent its further sale and development. This established a precedent addressing the legal implications of commercial reverse engineering efforts.

During production, Connectix unsuccessfully attempted a [[Chinese wall#Computer science|Chinese wall]] approach to [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] the BIOS, so its engineers [[disassembler|disassembled]] the [[object code]] directly. Connectix's successful appeal maintained that the direct disassembly and observation of proprietary code was necessary because there was no other way to determine its behavior. From the ruling:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others. Sony's BIOS lay at a distance from the core because it contains unprotected aspects that cannot be examined without copying. The court of appeal therefore accorded it a lower degree of protection than more traditional literary works.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3102">'''Commonhold''' is a system of property ownership in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. It involves the indefinite [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] tenure of part of a multi-occupancy building (typically a [[Apartment|flat]]) with shared ownership of and responsibility for common areas and services. It has features of the [[strata title]] and the [[condominium]] systems, which exist in [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] respectively. It was introduced by the [[Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002]] as an alternative to [[leasehold]], and was the first new type of legal estate to be introduced in [[English law]] since 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3675612.stm |title=Commonhold property ownership explained |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]] |first=Paul |last=Neville |date=3 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important difference between commonholds on the one hand and leaseholds (leases) on the other is that commonholds do not [[Depreciation|depreciate]] in value towards the end of their Term (''term'', ''[[term of years]]'' or in extraneous documents sometimes ''existence'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://property.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/property/new_homes/article6286224.ece |title=Brief encounter: commonhold property |date=15 May 2009 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |first=Mark |last=Loveday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years since the 2002 Act became law, only a handful of commonholds have been registered, whilst hundreds of thousands of long leases have been granted during the same period. As of 3 June 2009, there were 12 commonhold residential developments comprising 97 units (homes) in England and one commonhold residential development comprising 30 units (homes) in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], {{UK Parliament |speaker=[[Michael Wills]] | date=9 June 2009 | place=Written Questions | url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2009-06-09c.278364.h |column=792W |title=Commonhold }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where freehold houses should be subjected to [[positive covenants]] which force their owners contribute to communal maintenance, such as in [[garden square]]s, as few such duties can attach to [[freehold (law)|freeholds]], access to such areas can be physically restricted to those who own that area, commonly through a residents' Management Company.  Such a company if the land was owned by the original landlord such as a developer may come into the hands of the lessees (tenants) through a statutory process of the [[Right to Manage]] leading to legal agreements or a court order which creates a limited liability Right to Manage (also known as an RTM) Company.  A common alternative has been [[rentcharge]]s where truly necessary services or contributions need to be made which cannot devolve to a local authority or statutory undertaker through ''adoption''.

The '''Hague Congress''' or the '''Congress of Europe''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.2830/13717 |isbn=978-92-78-40525-0 |title=The ABC of European Union Law |last1=Borchardt |first1=Klaus-Dieter |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; considered by many as the first federal moment of the European history, was held in [[The Hague]] from 7–11 May 1948 with 750 delegates participating from around [[Europe]] as well as observers from [[Canada]] and the [[United States of America]].

The Congress brought together representatives from across a broad political spectrum, providing them with the opportunity to discuss ideas about the development of European political co-operation. Important political figures such as [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], Sir [[David Maxwell-Fyfe]], [[Pierre-Henri Teitgen]], [[François Mitterrand]] (both ministers in [[Robert Schuman]]'s government), three former French prime ministers, [[Paul Reynaud]], [[Édouard Daladier]], [[Paul Ramadier]], [[Paul van Zeeland]], [[Albert Coppé]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]] took part.

A broad range of philosophers, journalists, church leaders, lawyers, professors, entrepreneurs and historians also took an active role in the congress. A call was launched for a political, economic and monetary Union of Europe. This landmark conference was to have a profound influence on the shape of the [[European Movement]], which was created soon afterwards.

The Spanish statesman [[Salvador de Madariaga]] proposed the establishment of a [[College of Europe]] at the Congress. This would be a college where university graduates from many different countries, some only a short while before at war with each other, could study and live together.

The Congress also discussed the future structure and role of the [[Council of Europe]]. Teitgen and Maxwell-Fyfe were instrumental in creating the [[Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] at the Council of Europe.

The Congress provided the means to heighten public opinion for European unity. On  20 July 1948,  at the Hague meeting of ministers of [[Western European Union]],  Schuman's Foreign Minister [[Georges Bidault]] proposed the creation of a European Assembly (realized in the later [[Council of Europe]]) and a customs and economic union (the later [[European Coal and Steel Community]]  and the two communities of the [[Treaties of Rome]]). Thus the conclusions of the Congress became French government policy and then the subject of European governmental policy.

The '''Constitutional Court''' ({{lang-th|ศาลรัฐธรรมนูญ}}, {{RTGS|''San Ratthathammanun''}}, {{IPA-th|sǎːn rát.tʰā.tʰām.mā.nūːn|pron}}) is an independent [[Thailand|Thai]] [[constitutional court|court]] founded under the [[Constitution of Thailand|1997 Constitution]] with jurisdiction over the [[constitutionality]] of parliamentary acts, royal decrees, draft legislation, as well as the appointment and removal of public officials and issues regarding political parties. The current court was established by the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|2007 Constitution]] and is part of the [[Judiciary of Thailand|judicial branch]] of the Thai national government.

The court, along with the 1997 Constitution, was dissolved and replaced by a Constitutional Tribunal in 2006 following the [[2006 Thai coup d'état|coup d'État]]. While the Constitutional Court had [[#1997 Constitution|15 members]], 7 from the judiciary and 8 selected by a special panel, the Constitution Tribunal had [[#2006 Constitution|9 members]], all from the judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015571 Nine Constitution Tribunal members] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231520/http://nationmultimedia.com/breakingnews/read.php?newsid=30015571 |date=26 September 2007 }}, 7 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A similar institution, consisting of [[#2007 Constitution|9 members]], was again established by the [[2007 Constitution of Thailand|2007 Constitution]].

The Constitutional Court has provoked much public debate, both regarding the court's jurisdiction and composition as well as the initial selection of justices. A long-standing issue has been the degree of control exerted by the judiciary over the court{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

The decisions of the court are final and inappealable. The decisions also bind every state organ, including the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers and other courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | script-title=th:ข้อกำหนดศาลรัฐธรรมนูญว่าด้วยวิธีพิจารณาและการทำคำวินิจฉัย พ.ศ. 2550 - ข้อ 55 วรรค 1 |trans-title=Constitutional Court Regulations on Procedure and Decision Making, BE 2550 (2007) - regulation 55, paragraph 1 | url = http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2550/A/096/14.PDF | language = Thai | publisher = Cabinet Secretariat | location = Bangkok | date = 2007-12-21 | accessdate = 2014-05-13 | page = 28 | issue = Volume 124, Part 96 A | journal = Government Gazette }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various versions of the court have made several significant decisions. These included the 1999 decision that deputy minister of agriculture [[Newin Chidchop]] could retain his cabinet seat after being sentenced to imprisonment for defamation, the 2001 acquittal of Thaksin Shinawatra for filing an incomplete statement regarding his wealth, with the [[National Anti-Corruption Commission]], the 2003 invalidation of [[Jaruvan Maintaka]] appointment as auditor-general, the 2007 dissolution of the [[Thai Rak Thai]] political party, and the 2014 removal of [[Prime minister of Thailand|prime minister]] [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] from office.

== Origins and controversy ==

[[File:Constitutional Court Thailand.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Former seat of the court at Lord Rattanathibet's Mansion on Chak Phet Road, [[Phra Nakhon District]], Bangkok.]]

=== Drafting of the 1997 Constitution ===

The creation of the Constitutional Court was the subject of much debate during the 1996-1997 drafting of the current [[Constitution of Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;James R. Klein, "The Battle for Rule of Law in Thailand: The Constitutional Court of Thailand", [http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/ThaiUpdate_Klien_ConCourt%20Apr03.pdf PDF] and {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320070648/http://www.cdi.anu.edu.au/CDIwebsite_1998-2004/thailand/thailand_downloads/ThaiUpdate_Klien_ConCourt%20Apr03.pdf |date=20 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior judges rigorously opposed the concept on the grounds that constitutional and judicial review should remain the prerogative of the Supreme Court and that a constitutional court would create a fourth branch of government more powerful than the judiciary, legislature, or executive. Judges stated their fear over political interference in the selection and impeachment of judges. The Constitution Drafting Assembly eventually made several concessions regarding the composition and powers of the Court.

==== Jurisdiction ====

The Constitution did not give the Constitutional Court the authority to overrule a final judgment of the Supreme Court. An affected party, or a court, could request the opinion from the Constitutional Court if they believed a case involved a constitutional issue. The court where the initial action was pending would stay its proceedings until the Constitutional Court issued its decision. Constitutional Court decisions would have no retroactive effect on previous decisions of the regular courts.

The Constitution also did not give the Constitutional Court the authority to rule on any case in which the Constitution did not specifically delegate an agency the power to adjudicate.

==== Impeachment ====
The Constitution allowed individual justices to be the subject of impeachment proceedings with the vote of one fourth of the members of the House or with 50,000 approval of petitioners. A vote of three fifths of the Senate is required for impeachment. Earlier drafts had required votes of only 10% of the combined House and Senate to call for a vote of impeachment, and votes of three fifths of the combined Parliament to dismiss a justice.

==== Appointment ====
The Constitution gave the judiciary a strong influence over the composition of the Constitutional Court. Originally, the Court was to have 9 justices comprising six legal experts and three political science experts. A panel of 17 persons would propose 18 names from which Parliament would elect the 9 justices. The panel president would be the president of the Supreme Court, the panel itself would have included 4 political party representatives. The CDA finally compromised and allowed 7 of the justices to be selected by the judiciary, while the remaining 8 justices would be selected by the Senate from a list of Supreme Court nominees.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Appointment of the first Constitutional Court ===
The appointment of the first Constitutional Court following the promulgation of the constitution in 1997 was 4-month controversy pitting the Senate against the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; A key issue was the Senate's authority to review the backgrounds of judicial nominees and reject nominees deemed inappropriate or unqualified.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==== Appointment of Amphorn Thongprayoon ====

After receiving the Supreme Court's list of nominees, the Senate created a committee to review the nominees' credentials
and backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; On 24 November 1997, the Senate voted to remove the name of Supreme
Court vice-president [[Amphorn Thongprayoon]], on the grounds that his credentials were dubious and on allegations that he had defaulted on 3 million [[baht|THB]] in debt. The Supreme Court was furious, arguing the Constitution did not empower the Senate to do background checks or to reject Supreme Court nominees. The Supreme Court requested a ruling from the Constitutional Tribunal chaired by the House speaker. On 8 January 1998, in a 6:3 vote, the Tribunal ruled the Senate did ''not'' have the authority to do background checks or reject the Supreme Court's nominees. The Tribunal ruled that the Senate's review powers were limited to examining the records of the nominees and electing half of those nominees for appointment.

Immediately after the Supreme Court had filed its request to the Tribunal, Justice Amphorn withdrew his name. After the Tribunal's ruling, the Supreme Court elected justice [[Jumpol na Songkhla]] on 9 January 1998 to replace Amphorn. The Senate ignored the Tribunal's ruling and proceeded to review Jumphol’s background and delayed a vote to accept his nomination for 7 days so that the Senate evaluate Jumphol. Finding no problems, the Senate proceeded to acknowledge his appointment to the Court on 23 January 1998.

==== Appointment of Ukrit Mongkolnavin ====

The appointment of former Senate and Parliament president [[Ukrit Mongkolnavin]] was especially problematic.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; The Senate had initially elected Ukrit from the list of ten legal specialists nominated by the selection panel, despite claims from democracy activists that Ukrit was unqualified to guard the constitution because he had served dictators while president of Parliament under the 1991-1992 military government of the [[National Peace Keeping Council|National Peacekeeping Council]].

Stung by the Senate rejection of Amphorn Thongprayoon, the two Bangkok Civil Court judges, [[Sriampron Salikhup]] and [[Pajjapol Sanehasangkhom]], petitioned the Constitutional Tribunal to disqualify Ukrit on a legal technicality. They argued that Ukrit only had an honorary [[professorship]] at [[Chulalongkorn University]], while the 1997 Constitution specifically specifies that a nominee, if not meeting other criteria, must be at least a [[professor]]. Echoing the Senate's rejection of Amphorn, the judges also alleged that Ukrit was involved in a multi-million baht lawsuit over a [[golf course]]. On 10 January 1998 the Tribunal ruled that the judges were not affected parties and therefore they had no right to request a ruling. Nevertheless, the Parliament president invoked his power as chairman of the Tribunal to ask the Senate to reconsider Ukrit's nomination.

On 19 January 1998, the Senate reaffirmed Ukrit's qualifications, noting that his professorship was special only because he was not a government official. Under [[Chulalongkorn University|Chulalongkorn]]'s regulations, he had the academic status of a full professor.

This position inflamed activists and the judiciary, and prompted the Parliament president on 21 January to invoke his authority under Article 266 of the 1997 Constitution to order the Constitutional Tribunal to consider the issue. On 8 February, in a 4:3 vote, the Tribunal ruled that Ukrit's special professorship did ''not'' qualify him for a seat in the Constitutional Court. The Tribunal noted that Chulalongkorn criteria for honorary professor were different from their criteria for academic professors, as intended by the Constitution. The Senate ended up electing [[Komain Patarapirom]] to replace Ukrit.

== Key decisions ==
{{main|Rulings of the Constitutional Court of Thailand}}

=== Chuan-government emergency decrees during the 1997 economic crisis ===

==== Unconstitutionality of emergency economic decrees ====

In its very first decision, the Court ruled on the constitutionality of four emergency executive decrees issued by the [[Chuan Leekpai|Chuan]] government to deal with the [[Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; The government had issued the decrees in early May 1998 to expand the role of the [[Financial Restructuring Authority, Thailand|Financial Restructuring Authority]] and the [[Assets Management Corporation, Thailand|Assets Management Corporation]], to settle the debts of the [[Financial Institutions Development Fund]] through the issue of 500 billion THB in [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and to authorize the [[Ministry of Finance (Thailand)|ministry of finance]] to seek 200 billion THB in overseas loans. The opposition [[New Aspiration Party]] (NAP) did not have the votes to defeat the bills, and therefore, on the last day of debate, invoked Article 219 of the Constitution to question the constitutionality of an emergency decree.

The NAP argued that since there was no emergency nor necessary urgency (under Article 218(2)), the government could not issue any emergency decrees. Article 219, however, specifically notes the constitutionality of an emergency decree can be questioned only on Article 218(1) concerning the maintenance of national or public safety, national economic security, or to avert public calamity. The government, fearing further economic damage if the decree were delayed, opposed the Court's acceptance of the complaint, as the opposition clearly had failed to cite the proper constitutional clause. The Court wished to set a precedent, however, demonstrating it would accept petitions under Article 219, even if technically inaccurate. Within a day it ruled that it was obvious to the general public that the nation was in an economic crisis, and that the decrees were designed to assist with national economic security in accordance with Article 218(1). The decrees were later quickly approved by Parliament.

The NAP's last minute motion damaged its credibility, and made it unlikely that Article 219 will be invoked unless there is a credible issue and the issue is raised and discussed at the beginning of parliamentary debate, rather than at the last-minute before a vote.

On the other hand, a precedent was established by the Court that it would accept all petitions under Article 219 to preserve Parliament's right to question the constitutionality of emergency executive decrees.

==== Treaty status of IMF letters of intent ====

The NAP later filed impeachment proceedings with the [[National Anti-Corruption Commission (Thailand)|National Anti-Corruption Commission]] (NACC) against prime minister Chuan Leekpai and the minister of finance [[Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda]] for violation of the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Klein" /&gt; The NAP argued that the [[letter of intent]] that the government signed with the [[International Monetary Fund|International Monetary Fund (IMF)]] to secure emergency financial support was a [[treaty]], and that Article 224 of the Constitution stipulated that the government must receive prior consent from Parliament to enter a treaty.

The NACC determined the issue concerned a constitutional interpretation and petitioned the Constitutional Court for an opinion. The Court ruled the IMF letters were not treaties, as internationally defined, because they were unilateral documents from the Thai government with no rules for enforcement or provisions for penalty. Moreover, the IMF itself had worded the letters in a way that stated that the letters were not [[contractual agreement]]s.

=== Appointment of Jaruvan Maintaka as auditor-general ===

On 24 June 2003, a petition was filed with the Constitutional Court seeking its decision on the constitutionality of Jaruvan Maintaka’s appointment by the Senate as auditor-general. Jaruvan was one of three nominees for the position of auditor-general in 2001, along with Prathan Dabpet and Nontaphon Nimsomboon. Prathan received 5 votes from the 8-person State Audit Commission (SAC) chairman while Jaruvan received 3 votes. According to the constitution, State Audit Commission chairman Panya Tantiyavarong should have submitted Prathan's nomination to the Senate, as he received the majority of votes. However, on 3 July 2001, the SAC chairman submitted a list of all three candidates for the post of auditor-general to the Senate, which later voted to select Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka.

The Constitutional Court ruled on 6 July 2004 that the selection process that led to the appointment of Jaruvan as auditor-general was unconstitutional. The Court noted that the Constitution empowers the SAC to nominate only one person with the highest number of votes from a simple majority, not three as had been the case. The court stopped short of saying if she had to leave her post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824163056/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p3.php Chronology of events in the auditor-general’s deadlock, The Nation 30 August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the Constitutional Court had ruled on 4 July 2002 that the then [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]] chairman [[Sirin Thoopklam]]’s election to the body was unconstitutional, the president of the Court noted "when the court rules that the selection [process] was unconstitutional and has to be redone, the court requires the incumbent to leave the post".&lt;ref&gt;The Nation, [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/02/politics/politics_30005477.php "Jaruvan again in eye of the storm"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004821/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/06/02/politics/politics_30005477.php |date=12 March 2007 }}, 2 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Jaruwan refused to resign without a royal dismissal from king Bhumibol Adulyadej. She noted "I came to take the position as commanded by a royal decision, so I will leave the post only when directed by such a decision."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070824163322/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p26.php Jaruvan waits for royal word, Nation 9 September 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The State Audit Commission later nominated Wisut Montriwat, former deputy permanent secretary of the ministry of finance, for the post of auditor-general. The Senate approved the nomination on 10 May 2005. However, king Bhumibol Adulyadej, in an unprecedented move, withheld his royal assent. The National Assembly did not hold a vote to overthrow the royal veto. In October 2005 the Senate rejected a motion to reaffirm her appointment, and instead deferred the decision to the SAC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/specials/polcrisis/p53.php Senate steers clear of motion on Jaruvan, The Nation, 11 October 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2006 the State Audit Commission (SAC) decided to reinstate auditor-general Khunying Jaruvan Maintaka. Its unanimous decision came after it received a memo from the office of king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]’s principal private secretary, advising that the situation be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145651/http://bangkokpost.net/News/05May2006_news01.php Poll booths 'the decider', Bangkok Post Friday 5 May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy led many to [[Bhumibol Adulyadej#Royal powers|reinterpret the political and judicial role of the king in Thailand's constitutional monarchy]].

=== Thaksin Shinawatra's alleged conflicts of interest ===
In February 2006, 28 Senators submitted a petition to the Constitutional Court calling for the prime minister's impeachment for conflicts of interest and improprieties in the sell-off of Shin Corporation under Articles 96, 216 and 209 of the Thai constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Xinhua, [http://english.people.com.cn/200607/29/eng20060729_287811.html Students submit voters petition to impeach Thai PM], 29 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The Senators said the prime minister violated the Constitution and was no longer qualified for office under Article 209. However, the Court rejected the petition on 16 February, with the majority judges saying the petition failed to present sufficient grounds to support the prime minister's alleged misconduct.

'''Cut throat competition''' is a term that was widely used to describe the reason for [[consumer protection]] regulation, [[labour law]], and enforcement of [[competition law]] or antitrust, in the late 19th and early 20th century.

In economics, cut throat competition is also referred to as ruinous, excessive or unfettered competition. More generally, cut throat competition is also subsumed under the term "destructive competition".

Many countries have strict legislation against cut throat competition and [[anti-competitive practices]] in pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruwantissa Abeyratne|title=Strategic Issues in Air Transport: Legal, Economic and Technical Aspects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BISPzlwSfBoC&amp;pg=PA366|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-21959-7|pages=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the alleged necessity of a pricing agreement to avoid cut-throat competition is not considered a valid defense in the case of a proven [[price fixing]] agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-competitors/price-fixing|title=Price Fixing|work=Competition Guidance|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27345">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Daubert'' standard}}
In United States federal law, the '''''Daubert'' standard''' is a [[rule of evidence]] regarding the admissibility of [[expert witness]]es' [[testimony]]. A party may raise a '''''Daubert'' motion''', a special [[motion in limine|motion ''in limine'']] raised before or during [[trial (law)|trial]], to exclude the presentation of unqualified [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to the [[jury]]. The '''''Daubert'' trilogy''' are the three [[United States Supreme Court]] cases that articulated the Daubert standard:

*''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals]]'', which held in 1993 that Rule 702 of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] did not incorporate the [[Frye test|Frye "general acceptance" test]] as a basis for assessing the admissibility of scientific expert testimony, but that the rule incorporated a flexible reliability standard instead;
*''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;522 U.S. 136 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; which held in 1997 that a district court judge may exclude expert testimony when there are gaps between the evidence relied on by an expert and that person's conclusion, and that an abuse-of-discretion standard of review is the proper standard for appellate courts to use in reviewing a trial court's decision of whether it should admit expert testimony;
*''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'',&lt;ref&gt;526 U.S. 137 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; which held in 1999 that the judge's gatekeeping function identified in ''Daubert'' applies to all expert testimony, including that which is non-scientific.

Important appellate-level opinions that clarify the standard include Judge [[Alex Kozinski|Kozinski]]'s opinion in Daubert on remand ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-102.ZO.html ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'', 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995)]), and Judge [[Edward Roy Becker|Becker]]'s opinion in ''[[In re Paoli R.R. Yard PCB Litig.]]'', 35 F.3d 717 (3d Cir. 1994).

==Definition==
In ''Daubert'', seven members of the Court agreed on the following guidelines for admitting scientific expert testimony:
*'''Judge is gatekeeper:''' Under Rule 702, the task of "gatekeeping", or assuring that scientific expert testimony truly proceeds from "scientific knowledge", rests on the trial judge.
*'''Relevance and reliability:'''  This requires the trial judge to ensure that the expert's testimony is "relevant to the task at hand" and that it rests "on a reliable foundation". ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.'', 509 U.S. 579, 584-587. Concerns about expert testimony cannot be simply referred to the jury as a question of weight. Furthermore, the admissibility of expert testimony is governed by Rule 104(a), not Rule 104(b); thus, the Judge must find it more likely than not that the expert's methods are reliable and reliably applied to the facts at hand.
*'''Scientific knowledge = scientific method/methodology:'''  A conclusion will qualify as ''scientific knowledge'' if the proponent can demonstrate that it is the product of sound "scientific methodology" derived from the '''[[scientific method]].'''&lt;ref&gt;Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'' (1993) 509 U.S. 579, 589.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Illustrative Factors:'''  The Court defined "scientific methodology" as the process of formulating hypotheses and then conducting experiments to prove or falsify the hypothesis, and provided a set of illustrative factors (i.e., not a "test") in determining whether these criteria are met:
:# Whether the theory or technique employed by the expert is generally accepted in the scientific community;
:# Whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication;
:# Whether it can be and has been tested;
:# Whether the known or potential rate of error is acceptable; and 
:# Whether the research was conducted independent of the particular litigation or dependent on an intention to provide the proposed testimony.&lt;ref&gt;''Daubert v. Merrel Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'' 43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir. 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Rule 702 was amended in an attempt to codify and structure elements embodied in the "''Daubert'' trilogy."  The rule then read as follows:  
:'''Rule 702. Testimony by Experts'''  
: If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000.)

In 2011, Rule 702 was again amended to make the language clearer. The rule now reads:
: RULE 702. TESTIMONY BY EXPERT WITNESSES
: A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:
: (a)	The expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
: (b)	The testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
: (c)	The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
: (d)	The expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011)

While some federal courts still rely on pre-2000 opinions in determining the scope of ''Daubert'', as a technical legal matter any earlier judicial rulings that conflict with the language of amended Rule 702 are no longer good precedent.

==Use==
Although the Daubert standard is now the law in federal court and over half of the states, the [[Frye standard|''Frye'' standard]] remains the law in some jurisdictions including California, Illinois, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Giannelli &amp; [[Edward Imwinkelried|E. Imwinkelried]], Scientific Evidence §§ 1.06, 1.16 (4th ed. 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Florida passed a bill to adopt the Daubert standard as the law governing expert witness testimony, which took effect on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Legal/News/2013/06_-_June/Florida_adopts_new_standard_for_expert_evidence/ Reuters]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Florida Supreme Court rejected the Legislature's "Daubert Amendment" to the extent it is procedural in nature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2017/sc16-181.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although trial judges have always had the authority to exclude inappropriate testimony, prior to ''Daubert'', trial courts often preferred to let juries hear evidence proffered by both sides.&lt;ref name=Berger&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once certain evidence has been excluded by a ''Daubert'' motion because it fails to meet the relevancy and reliability standard, it will likely be challenged when introduced again in another trial. Even though a ''Daubert'' motion is not binding to other courts of law, if something was found untrustworthy by one court, other judges may choose to follow that precedent. Of course, a decision by an appellate court that a piece of evidence is inadmissible under ''Daubert'' would be binding on district courts within that court's jurisdiction.

===Daubert motion: timing===
To attack expert testimony as inadmissible, counsel may bring pretrial motions, including motions [[Motion in limine|in limine]].&lt;ref&gt;The third circuit has emphasized the importance of conducting in limine hearings under Fed. R. Evid. 104 (resolution of preliminary questions) when making reliability determinations required by Fed. R. Evid. 702 and ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'', 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L. Ed. 2d 469 (1993). ''See''  ''Padillas v. Stork-Gamco, Inc.'', 186 F.3d 412, 417 (3d Cir. 1999) ;  ''Voilas v. General Motors Corp.'', 73 F. Supp. 2d 452, 455 (D.N.J. 1999) (not holding hearing in this case, however). See also 1 Weinstein's Federal Evidence, Ch. 104, Preliminary Questions  (Matthew Bender 2d ed.); Edward J. Imwinkelried &amp; David A. Schlueter, Federal Evidence Tactics, Ch. 1, Article I: General Provisions, § 1.04 (Matthew Bender).&lt;/ref&gt;  The motion in limine may be brought prior to trial, although counsel may bring the motion during trial as well.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Smoot v. Mazda Motors of America, Inc., 469 F.3d 675, 676 (7th Cir. 2006) (case dismissed after plaintiff expert's testimony excluded); Curtis v. M&amp;S Petroleum, Inc., 174 F.3d 661, 667 (5th Cir. 1999) ; United States v. Nichols, 169 F.3d 1255, 1265-1266 (10th Cir. 1999 ); Heller v.

Ga. 2002) (rejecting objection of untimeliness of motion in limine to exclude expert testimony on ground that motion in limine is not dispositive); United States v. Lester, 234 F. Supp. 2d 595, 597-598 (E.D. Va. 2002) (criminal defendant's motion to allow expert testimony regarding reliability of eyewitness testimony denied); Lentz v. Mason, 32 F. Supp. 2d 733, 737 (D.N.J. 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

A motion attacking expert testimony should be brought within a reasonable time after the close of [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] if the grounds for the objection can be reasonably anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Pineda v. Ford Motor Co., 520 F.3d 237, 241-242 (3d Cir. 2008) (after deposition of plaintiff's expert, defendant filed alternative motions to exclude testimony of plaintiff's expert and for summary judgment, and motion for Daubert hearing).&lt;/ref&gt; The hearing should be made well in advance of the first time a case appears on a trial calendar.

In one case where a Daubert hearing was conducted on the day of the trial, in which the district court excluded all plaintiff's expert testimony, resulting in the dismissal of all claims, the appellate court remanded the case because of multiple irregularities and a defective record of lower court proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Webster v. Fulton County, Ga., 85 F. Supp. 2d 1375, 1377 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (denying defendant's Daubert motion as untimely, when brought after court had relied on plaintiff expert's report in denying defense summary judgment motion, and within days of trial date). See also Alfred v. Caterpillar, Inc., 262 F.3d 1083, 1087 (10th Cir. 2001 ) (counsel should not ''sandbag'' Daubert concerns until close of opponent's case''; however, appellate court did not reach issue of late filing of motion because district court chose to address defendant's Daubert objections on merits, rather than deeming them waived); Pullman v. Land O'Lakes, Inc., 262 F.3d 759, 763 (8th Cir. 2001) (appellate court noted with disapproval that defendant failed to bring Daubert motion ''until shortly before the trial began''; Daubert inapplicable to experimental test evidence not presented by expert witnesses).&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellate court noted that in cases that rely heavily on expert testimony, a district court should set a discovery&lt;ref&gt;See Smith v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 713, 722 (7th Cir. 2000) . See also Goebel v. Denver and Rio Grande W. R.R., 215 F.3d 1083, 1087 (10th Cir. 2000) (district court orally denied motion to exclude expert testimony on morning of trial); McPike v. Corghi S.p.A., 87 F. Supp. 2d 890, 891 n.1 (E.D. Ark. 1999) (court telephoned attorneys with ruling denying defendant's motion to exclude plaintiff's expert testimony, because closeness of trial did not allow time for formal written memo and order at that time; court later rendered substituted memorandum and order, fully stating reasons for its decision in writing).&lt;/ref&gt; and trial schedule that realistically provides both sides with an adequate opportunity to introduce necessary evidence. The application of Federal Rule of Evidence 702 to proposed expert testimony can often be an uncertain process, and is best conducted in such a manner that litigants have a reasonable opportunity to locate experts who meet the rule's requirements.

In another case in which the defendant was apparently at fault for filing a motion to exclude expert testimony one week before the trial date, the district court denied the motion on that ground, but it advised the defendant that it might conduct its own ''[[voir dire]]'' of the expert in question before he testified. The district court preliminarily found that defendant's motion was predicated on a ruling made almost three months earlier by a district court in another state, and that defendant had shown no good cause for waiting to file the motion. The defendant ultimately lost that case, following the admission of the disputed expert testimony, and ultimately failed in its appeal.&lt;ref&gt;See Clay v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 663, 674 (6th Cir. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

An evidentiary hearing on the motion may not be necessary if the court finds that it would not assist the court in ruling on any of the matters in the motion.

==History==
Prior to ''Daubert'', relevancy in combination with the [[Frye test|''Frye'' test]] were the dominant standards for determining the admissibility of scientific evidence in Federal courts. ''Frye'' is based on a 1923 Federal Court of appeals ruling involving the admissibility of [[polygraph]] evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (DC Cir. 1923)&lt;/ref&gt;  Under ''Frye'', the Court based the admissibility of testimony regarding novel scientific evidence on whether it has "gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs." The trial court's gatekeeper role in this respect is typically described as conservative, thus helping to keep [[pseudoscience]] out of the courtroom by deferring to those in the field.

In ''Daubert'', the Supreme Court ruled that the 1923 Frye test was superseded by the 1975 [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], specifically Rule 702 governing expert testimony. Rule 702 originally stated (in its entirety),
&lt;blockquote&gt;If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Daubert'', the Court ruled that nothing in the Federal Rules of Evidence governing expert evidence "gives any indication that 'general acceptance' is a necessary precondition to the admissibility of scientific evidence. Moreover, such a rigid standard would be at odds with the Rules' liberal thrust and their general approach of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony."

By requiring experts to provide relevant opinions grounded in reliable methodology, proponents of ''Daubert'' were satisfied that these standards would result in a fair and rational resolution of the scientific and technological issues which lie at the heart of product liability adjudication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Owen |first=D. G. |title=A Decade of ''Daubert'' |year=2002 |volume=80 |journal=Denver University Law Review |pages=345 |issn=0883-9409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daubert has not appeared to further the Federal Rules philosophy of admitting generally all relevant testimony, and specifically of relaxing the traditional barriers to 'opinion' testimony."  The ''Daubert'' decision has instead been heralded by some political commentators as one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in imposing higher barriers for [[toxic tort]] and [[product liability]] cases, by allegedly reducing the volume of so-called [[junk science]] in the court room.

According to a 2002 [[RAND]] study, post Daubert, the percentage of expert testimony by scientists that was excluded from the courtroom significantly rose. This rise likely contributed to a doubling in successful motions for summary judgment in which 90% were against plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, L, Gill B. Changes in the Standards for Admitting Expert Evidence in Federal Civil Cases Since the ''Daubert'' Decision. RAND Institute for Civil Justice. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond this study, there is little empirical evidence of the impact of ''Daubert''.
However, some critics argue that ''Daubert'' has disrupted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants, “The exclusion of expert testimony affects plaintiffs far more than defendants because plaintiffs may then not be able to meet their required [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]. Furthermore, there is little point in plaintiffs going to the expense of Daubert motions to exclude defendant’s experts until they know if their case will proceed. So if more experts are now being excluded, then ''Daubert'' has undoubtedly shifted the balance between plaintiffs and defendants and made it more difficult for plaintiffs to litigate successfully.”&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;  Similarly, ''Daubert'' hearings can be subject to various abuses by attorneys attempting to bolster a weak case. These tactics can range from simply attempting to delay the case to driving up the costs of the litigation forcing settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gutheil |first=Thomas G. |author2=Bursztajn, Harold J. |date=1 June 2005|title=Attorney Abuses of ''Daubert'' Hearings: Junk Science, Junk Law, or Just Plain Obstruction? |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law |volume=33 |issue= 2|pages=150–152 |pmid=15985655 |url=http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/33/2/150 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different pattern has emerged in criminal cases. In criminal cases, the prosecution has the burden of proof and uses a host of forensic science methods as evidence to prove their case. But, ''Daubert'' motions are rarely made by criminal defendants and when they do, they lose a majority of the challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Risinger |first=D.

Some commentators believe that ''Daubert'' caused judges to become—in the phrase used in former Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]’s dissent in ''Daubert''—amateur scientists, many lacking the [[scientific literacy]] to effectively fulfill their role as gatekeeper of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gatowski |first=S. I. |year=2001 |title=Asking the gatekeepers: A National Survey of Judges on Judging Expert Evidence in a Post-''Daubert'' world |journal=[[Law and Human Behavior]] |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=433–458 |doi=10.1023/A:1012899030937 |url= |display-authors=1 |last2=Dobbin |first2=Shirley A. |last3=Richardson |first3=James T. |last4=Ginsburg |first4=Gerald P. |last5=Merlino |first5=Mara L. |last6=Dahir |first6=Veronica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although "science for judges" forums have emerged in the wake of ''Daubert'' in order to educate judges in a variety of scientific fields, many are still skeptical about the usefulness of the ''Daubert'' standard in discerning valid science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothman |first=K. J. |author2=Greenland, S. |authorlink2=Sander Greenland  |year=2005 |title=Causation and Causal Inference in Epidemiology |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=S1 |pages=S144–S150 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.059204 |url=|pmid=16030331 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melnick |first=R. |year=2005 |title=A ''Daubert'' Motion: A Legal Strategy to Exclude Essential Scientific Evidence in Toxic Tort Litigation |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=S1 |pages=S30–S34 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046250 |url=|pmid=16030335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jasanoff |first=S. |year=2005 |title=Law's Knowledge: Science for Justice in Legal Settings |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=95 |issue=S1 |pages=S49–S58 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.045732 |url=|pmid=16030338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The responsibility to assess scientific relevance has shifted from highly trained expert witnesses to judges deficient in science education. The "Daubert" ruling furthermore admits the possible introduction of non-peer reviewed data and conclusions. This increasingly shifts the burden of scientific judgement onto judges who have not had an education which would enable them to properly evaluate such data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16371283 | volume=1 | issue=3 | title=The admissibility of scientific evidence in psychiatric malpractice: junk science and the Daubert case |date=December 1994 | journal=J Clin Forensic Med |author=Tancredi, Laurence R |author2=Giannini, A. James |last-author-amp=yes| pages=145–8 | doi=10.1016/1353-1131(94)90082-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pursuant to Rule 104(a), in ''Daubert'' the U.S. Supreme Court suggested that the following factors be considered:&lt;ref&gt;See (c) of the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-102.ZS.html syllabus] of the ''Daubert'' case.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Has the technique been tested in actual field conditions (and not just in a laboratory)?
# Has the technique been subject to peer review and publication?
# What is the known or potential rate of error?
# Do standards exist for the control of the technique's operation?
# Has the technique been generally accepted within the relevant scientific community?

The Supreme Court explicitly cautioned that the Daubert list should not be regarded by judges as "a definitive checklist or test..." Yet in practice, judges have judged the admissibility of scientific evidence using the "Daubert factors" as a checklist; for example, the trial court judge in ''Kumho'' admitted to erroneously treating the factors as mandatory.&lt;ref name=Berger/&gt;

==International influence==
The [[Canadian Supreme Court]] has expressly adopted the Daubert standard in two cases.  [[R. v. Mohan]],;&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 2 S.C.R. 9&lt;/ref&gt; R. v. J.L.-J., [2000].&lt;ref&gt;2 S.C.R. 600&lt;/ref&gt; In J.L.-J., the Court took a look at the development of U.S. law in this regard, noted the U.S. Supreme Court's rejection of the Frye standard and its replacement with the Daubert Standard.  While the Court did note that:  " Daubert must be read in light of the specific text of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which differs from our own procedures," the Court also stated in the same sentence that "the U.S. Supreme Court did list a number of factors that could be helpful in evaluating the soundness of novel science."&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court then applied the Daubert standard to a decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal.  The Quebec Court had held that greater liberality should be applied by the Court in receiving pro-defense scientific evidence in a criminal case.&lt;ref&gt;[1998] R.J.Q.
2229, 130 C.C.C. (3d) 541, [1998] Q.J. No. 2493 (QL).&lt;/ref&gt;  The Court rejected this decision and reinstated the defendant's conviction.

Additionally, in 2005, the [[United Kingdom House of Commons]] [[Science and Technology Committee]] recommended the creation of a Forensic Science Advisory Council to regulate forensic evidence in the [[UK]] and observed that: &lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of an agreed protocol for the validation of scientific techniques prior to their being admitted in court is entirely unsatisfactory. Judges are not well-placed to determine scientific validity without input from scientists. We recommend that one of the first tasks of the Forensic Science Advisory Council be to develop a "gate-keeping" test for expert evidence. This should be done in partnership with judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system, and should build on the US ''Daubert'' test.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Science and Technology Committee (2005) ''[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmsctech/96/96i.pdf Forensic Science on Trial]'', London: The Stationery Office Limited, HC96-I, para.173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Law Commission for England and Wales has proposed a consultation paper (No.190) to adopt a criterion like the Daubert Standard to help reform the law of evidence in regards to the admissibility of scientific evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/docs/cp190.pdf The Admissiblity of Expert Evidence in Criminal Proceedings in England and Wales] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''disk image''', in computing, is a [[computer file]] containing the contents and structure of a [[disk volume]] or of an entire [[data storage device]], such as a [[hard disk drive]], [[tape drive]], [[floppy disk]], [[optical disc]] or [[USB flash drive]]. A disk image is usually made by creating a [[disk sector|sector]]-by-sector copy of the source medium, thereby perfectly replicating the structure and contents of a storage device independent of the [[file system]]. Depending on the disk image format, a disk image may span one or more computer files.

The [[file format]] may be an [[open standard]], such as the [[ISO image]] format for optical disc images, or a disk image may be unique to a particular software application.

The size can be huge because it contains the contents of an entire disk. To reduce storage requirements, if an imaging utility is filesystem-aware it can omit copying unused space, and it can [[data compression|compress]] the used space.

== History ==

Disk images were originally (in the late 1960s) used for [[backup]] and [[disk cloning]] of mainframe disk media, the early ones were as small as 5 [[megabytes]] and as large as 330 megabytes, and the copy medium was [[magnetic tape]], which ran as large as 200 megabytes per reel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Mainframe Operating Systems|url=http://www.demorton.com/Tech/$OSTL.pdf|accessdate=2014-06-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701185435/http://www.demorton.com/Tech/$OSTL.pdf|archivedate=2014-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disk images became much more popular when floppy disk media became popular, where replication or storage of an exact structure was necessary and efficient, especially in the case of [[copy protected]] floppy disks.

==Uses==

Disk images are used heavily for duplication of optical media including DVDs, Blu-ray disks, etc. It is also used to make perfect clones of hard disks.

A virtual disk may emulate any type of physical drive, such as a hard disk drive, [[tape drive]], [[USB flash drive|key drive]], [[floppy drive]], [[Compact disc|CD]]/[[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray Disc|BD]]/[[HD DVD]] or a [[network share]] among others; and of course, since it is not physical, requires a virtual reader device matched to it (see below). An emulated drive is typically created either in [[Random access memory|RAM]] for fast read/write access (known as a [[RAM disk]]), or on a hard drive. Typical uses of virtual drives include the [[Mount_(computing)|mounting]] of disk images of CDs and DVDs, and the mounting of virtual hard disks for the purpose of [[OTFE|on the fly disk encryption]] ("OTFE").

Some operating systems such as [[Linux]]&lt;ref name="linuxhelp"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.linuxhelp.net/linux_downloads/ |title= Linux ISO Images |publisher= LinuxHelp.net |accessdate= 2007-03-23 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070302124256/http://www.linuxhelp.net/linux_downloads/ |archivedate= 2007-03-02 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[macOS]]&lt;ref name="osx-dim"&gt;Although macOS's built-in DiskImageMounter software does not emulate a physical drive&lt;/ref&gt; have virtual drive functionality built-in (such as the [[loop device]]), while others such as older versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] require additional software. Starting from [[Windows 8]], Windows includes native virtual drive functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/30/accessing-data-in-iso-and-vhd-files.aspx |title = Accessing data in ISO and VHD files |work = Building Windows 8 (TechNet Blogs) |publisher = Microsoft |date = 30 August 2011 |accessdate = 27 April 2012 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120419080359/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/30/accessing-data-in-iso-and-vhd-files.aspx |archivedate = 19 April 2012 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848706(v=wps.620).aspx |title = Mount-DiskImage |work = Storage Cmdlets (TechNet) |publisher = Microsoft |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030435/https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848706(v=wps.620).aspx |archivedate = 2017-12-01 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual drives are typically read-only, being used to mount existing disk images which are not modifiable by the drive. However some software provides virtual CD/DVD drives which can produce new disk images; this type of virtual drive goes by a variety of names, including "virtual burner".

===Enhancement===
Using disk images in a virtual drive allows users to shift data between technologies, for example from CD optical drive to hard disk drive. This may provide advantages such as speed and noise (hard disk drives are typically four or five times faster than optical drives,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcguide.com/ref/cd/perfAccess-c.html pcguide.com - Access Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219222809/http://www.pcguide.com/ref/cd/perfAccess-c.html |date=2011-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are quieter, suffer from less wear and tear, and in the case of [[solid-state drives]], are immune to some physical trauma). In addition it may reduce power consumption, since it may allow just one device (a hard disk) to be used instead of two (hard disk plus optical drive).

Virtual drives may also be used as part of emulation of an entire machine (a [[virtual machine]]).

===Software distribution===
Since the spread of broadband, CD and DVD images have become a common medium for [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref name="linuxhelp"/&gt; Applications for [[macOS]] are often delivered online as an [[Apple Disk Image]] containing a file system that includes the application, documentation for the application, and so on.  Online data and bootable recovery CD images are provided for customers of certain commercial software companies.

Disk images may also be used to distribute software across a company network, or for portability (many CD/DVD images can be stored on a hard disk drive). There are several types of software that allow software to be distributed to large numbers of networked machines with little
or no disruption to the user. Some can even be scheduled to update only at night so that machines are not disturbed during business hours. These technologies reduce end-user impact and greatly reduce the time and man-power needed to ensure a secure corporate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Software Distribution |url=http://software.dell.com/products/kace-k1000-systems-management-appliance/software-distribution.aspx |publisher=Dell KACE |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003031633/http://software.dell.com/products/kace-k1000-systems-management-appliance/software-distribution.aspx |archivedate=2015-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficiency is also increased because there is much less opportunity for human error. Disk images may also be needed to transfer software to machines without a compatible physical disk drive.

For computers running [[macOS]], disk images are the most common file type used for [[software]] [[downloads]], typically downloaded with a [[web browser]]. The images are typically compressed [[Apple Disk Image]] (.dmg suffix) files. They are usually opened by directly mounting them without using a real disk. The advantage compared with some other technologies, such as Zip and RAR archives, is they do not need redundant drive space for the unarchived data.

Software packages for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] are also sometimes distributed as disk images including [[ISO image]]s. While Windows versions prior to [[Windows 7]] do not natively support mounting disk images to the files system, several software options are available to do this; see [[comparison of disc image software]].

=== Security ===
Virtual hard disks are often used in [[OTFE|on the fly disk encryption]] ("OTFE") software such as [[FreeOTFE]] and [[TrueCrypt]], where an encrypted "image" of a disk is stored on the computer. When the disk's password is entered, the disk image is "mounted", and made available as a new volume on the computer. Files written to this virtual drive are written to the encrypted image, and never stored in [[cleartext]].

The process of making a computer disk available for use is called "mounting", the process of removing it is called "dismounting" or "unmounting"; the same terms are used for making an encrypted disk available or unavailable.

=== Virtualization ===
A hard disk image is interpreted by a Virtual Machine Monitor as a system administrator using terms of naming, a hard disk image for a certain Virtual Machine monitor has a specific file 
Hard drive imaging is used in several major application areas
 Forensic imaging is the process where the entire drive contents are imaged to a file and values are verify the integrity of the image file Forensic images are acquired with the use of software tools. Some tools have added forensic functionality
apreviously mentioned, is typically used to replicate the contents of the hard drive for use in another system.  This can typically be done by software programs as it only structure are files themselves.
 Data recovery imaging is the process of imaging every single sector on the source drive to another medium from which required files can be retrieved.  In data recovery situations, one cannot rely on the integrity of the file structure and therefore a complete sector copy is mandatory to imaging end there though.  Forensic images are typically acquired using software tools However, forensic imaging software tools have significantly limited ability to deal with drives that have hard errors which is often the case in the first place
 Data recovery imaging must have the ability to work with unstable drives instability can be caused by wear and other issues Data recovery imaging must have the ability to read data from "bad sectors."  Read instability is a major factor when working with drives in A typical operating system  limited in its ability to deal with drives that take a long time to read.  For these reasons software that relies on the hard drive is often unsuccessful in data recovery imaging separate hardware control of the source hard drive is required to achieve the full spectrum of data recovery imaging. for the drive that can be violated hard drive may not allow data to be propagated through to the operating system on the drive may compensate by reading damaged data.
 Data recovery images may or may not make use of any type of image file. Typically, a data image is performed and therefore no image file is required.

There are two schemes predominant across all Virtual Machine Monitor implementations
 Pre allocate the entire storage for the virtual disk 
 The virtual disk can again be implemented storage is allocated Several Virtual Machine Monitor implementations the storage  providing it to the virtual machine that is in operation. 
There are two modes in which a disk can be mapped for a virtual machine
 The disk is presented as if it is a logical or a virtual disk file to the operating system and its hardware is hidden In data protection through isolation for concurrent updates because it presents the consistent behavior as a virtual disk file.
 Physical mode called the pass through mode, the by the layer and passes all physical characteristics of the underlying hardware are exposed to the guest operating system. There is no file locking to provide data protection.

===System backup===
{{See also2|[[System image]]|[[Backup and Restore]] (for Windows Vista and later)}}
Some backup programs only back up user files; [[booting|boot]] information and files locked by the operating system, such as those in use at the time of the backup, may not be saved on some operating systems. A disk image contains all files, faithfully replicating all data.  For this reason, it is also used for backing up [[CD]]s and [[DVD]]s.

Files that don't belong to installed programs can usually be backed up with file-based backup software, and this is preferred because file-based backup usually saves more time or space because they never copy unused space (as a ''bit-identical'' image does), they usually are capable of incremental backups, and generally have more flexibility. But for files of installed programs, file-based backup solutions may fail to reproduce all necessary characteristics, particularly with Windows systems. For example, in Windows certain registry keys use [[short filename]]s, which are sometimes not reproduced by file-based backup, some [[commercial software]] uses [[copy protection]] that will cause problems if a file is moved to a different [[disk sector]], and file-based backups do not always reproduce [[metadata]] such as security attributes. Creating a bit-identical disk image is one way to ensure the system backup will be exactly as the original. Bit-identical images can be made in [[Linux]] with [[dd (unix)|dd]], available on nearly all [[live CD]]s.

Most commercial imaging software is "user-friendly" and "automatic" but may not create bit-identical images. These programs have most of the same advantages, except that they may allow restoring to partitions of a different size or file-allocation size, and thus may ''not'' put files on the same exact sector. Additionally, if they do not support [[Windows Vista]], they may slightly move or realign partitions and thus make Vista unbootable (see [[Windows Vista startup process]]).

===Rapid deployment of clone systems===
Large enterprises often need to buy or replace new computer systems in large numbers. Installing operating system and programs into each of them one by one requires a lot of time and effort and has a significant possibility of human error. Therefore, system administrators use disk imaging to quickly clone the [[Standard operating environment|fully prepared software environment]] of a reference system. This method saves time and effort and allows administrators to focus on unique distinctions that each system must bear.

There are several types of disk imaging software available that use single instancing technology to reduce the time, bandwidth, and storage required to capture and archive disk images. This makes it possible to rebuild and transfer 
information-rich disk images at lightning speeds, which is a significant improvement over the days when programmers spent hours configuring each machine within an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Disk Imaging |url=http://software.dell.com/products/kace-k2000-systems-deployment-appliance/disk-imaging.aspx |publisher=Dell KACE |accessdate=2015-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002205915/http://software.dell.com/products/kace-k2000-systems-deployment-appliance/disk-imaging.aspx |archivedate=2015-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy hardware emulation ===

[[Emulator]]s frequently use disk images to simulate the floppy drive of the computer being emulated. This is usually simpler to program than accessing a real floppy drive (particularly if the disks are in a format not supported by the host operating system), and allows a large library of software to be managed.

=== Copy protection circumvention ===

A ''mini image'' is an optical disc image file in a format that fakes the disk's content to bypass [[CD/DVD copy protection]].

Because they are the full size of the original disk, Mini Images are stored instead. Mini Images are small, on the order of [[kilobyte]]s, and contain just the information necessary to bypass CD-checks.  Therefore; the Mini Image is a form of a [[No-CD crack]], for unlicensed games, and legally backed up games. Mini images do not contain the real data from an image file, just the code that is needed to satisfy the CD-check. They cannot provide CD or DVD backed data to the computer program such as on-disk image or video files.

== Creation ==

Creating a disk image is achieved with a suitable program. Different disk imaging programs have varying capabilities, and may focus on hard drive imaging (including [[hard drive]] [[backup]], restore and rollout), or [[optical media]] imaging (CD/DVD images).

A ''virtual disk writer'' or ''virtual burner'' is a computer program that emulates an actual disc authoring device such as a CD writer or DVD writer. Instead of writing data to an actual disc, it creates a virtual disk image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phantom Burner Overview|url=http://www.phantombility.com/en/prod/phantomburner/|publisher=Phantombility, Inc|accessdate=19 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819141722/http://phantombility.com/en/prod/phantomburner|archivedate=19 August 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual CD - The original for your PC|url=http://www.virtualcd.de/vcd/apps/overview/original.cfm?lg=0|work=Virtual CD website|publisher=H+H Software GmbH|accessdate=19 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924022331/http://www.virtualcd.de/vcd/apps/overview/original.cfm?lg=0|archivedate=24 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A virtual burner, by definition, appears as a disc drive in the system with writing capabilities (as opposed to conventional disc authoring programs that can create virtual disk images), thus allowing software that can burn discs to create virtual discs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual CD/DVD-Writer Device|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualmedia/|work=[[SourceForge]]|publisher=Geeknet, Inc.|accessdate=19 July 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217075400/http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualmedia/|archivedate=17 February 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== File formats ==
In most cases, a file format is tied to a particular software package. The software defines and uses its own, often proprietary, image format, though some formats are widely supported by open standards. These formats are supported by nearly all optical disc software

== Utilities ==
RawWrite and WinImage are examples of [[IMG (file format)|floppy disk image]] file writer/creator for [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. They can be used to create raw image files from a [[floppy disk]], and write such image files to a floppy.

In [[Unix]] or [[Unix-like|similar systems]] the [[Dd (Unix)|dd]] program can be used to create disk images, or to write them to a particular disk. It is also possible to mount and access them at block level using a [[loop device]].

[[Apple Disk Copy]] can be used on [[Classic Mac OS]] and [[macOS]] systems to create and write disk image files.

Authoring software for CDs/DVDs such as [[Nero Burning ROM]] can generate and load disk images for optical media.

The '''East Pakistan Provincial Assembly''', known as the '''East Bengal Legislative Assembly''' between 1947 and 1955, was the legislature of [[Bangladesh]] when the country was a province of [[Pakistan]] as [[East Bengal]] (1947-1955) and [[East Pakistan]] (1955-1971). The legislature was a successor to the [[Legislatures of British India|British Raj-era parliament]] of Bengal, which was divided between East Bengal and [[West Bengal]] during the [[partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal in 1947]]. It was the largest provincial legislature in Pakistan.

During the Bangladesh War of Independence in 1971, most Bengali members elected to the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|Pakistani National Assembly]] and the East Pakistani provincial assembly became members of the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh.

==History==
===Partition of Bengal===
On 20 June 1947, 141 East Bengali legislators from the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]] voted on the partition of Bengal, with 107 supporting joining Pakistan's [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|Constituent Assembly]] if India was partitioned.&lt;ref name="Mukherjee1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Soumyendra Nath Mukherjee|title=Sir William Jones: A Study in Eighteenth-century British Attitudes to India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bhd-_1RE04MC&amp;pg=PA230|year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-86131-581-9|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sylhet region in Assam voted in a referendum to join East Bengal. After the creation of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], those 141 legislators, in addition to legislators from Sylhet of the Assam Legislative Assembly, formed the East Bengal Legislative Assembly. The [[Muslim League (Pakistan)|Muslim League]]'s [[Khawaja Nazimuddin|Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin]] became the first chief minister. He was succeeded by [[Nurul Amin]] in 1948. The assembly was housed in [[Jagannath Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The All Pakistan Legal Decisions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NAg-AQAAIAAJ|year=1949|publisher=The All-Pakistan Legal Decisions|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the vicinity of the [[University of Dacca]] and the [[Dhaka High Court|High Court of Dacca]]. The area was the center of the [[Bengali Language Movement]] in 1952.

===Land reform===
The assembly passed the [[East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950]]. The act repealed the earlier laws and regulations which formed the [[permanent settlement]] during British rule.

===United Front comes to power===
The [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]] coalition, led by the [[Krishak Praja Party]] and the [[Awami League]], routed the Muslim League during the [[East Pakistani legislative election, 1954|provincial general election]] in 1954. The Farmer and Labour Party leader [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] became chief minister for six weeks. The United Front called for complete autonomy in East Bengal, except in defence and foreign policy; and the recognition of Bengali as a federal language.&lt;ref name="SinghKukreja2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahendra Prasad Singh|author2=Veena Kukreja|title=Federalism in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3g9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140|date=7 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-55973-3|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The East Bengal Legislative Assembly passed a law for the establishment of the [[Bangla Academy|Bengali Academy]]. However, Huq's government was dismissed within two months. Huq was placed under house arrest.&lt;ref name="Nair1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=M. Bhaskaran Nair|title=Politics in Bangladesh: A Study of Awami League, 1949-58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mB9N4oxuSY8C&amp;pg=PA85|year=1990|publisher=Northern Book Centre|isbn=978-81-85119-79-3|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of [[Governor General of Pakistan|Governor General]]'s rule, [[Abu Hussain Sarkar]] became chief minister in 1955.

===One Unit and 1956 Constitution===
As a result of the [[One Unit]] scheme, the assembly was renamed as the [[East Pakistan]] Provincial Assembly in 1955. Pakistan became a [[republic]] under the [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956]], in which Bengali was recognized as a federal language as a concession to East Pakistan.

In 1957, the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly adopted a unanimous resolution demanding full autonomy.&lt;ref name="Assembly1957"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pakistan. National Assembly|title=Parliamentary Debates. Official Report|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y3cdAAAAIAAJ|year=1957|page=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ataur Rahman Khan]] became chief minister in 1956.

===Martial law===
In 1958, a brawl broke out between political factions in the assembly, resulting in the deputy speaker [[Shahed Ali Patwary]] being injured. Patwary later died. The confrontation was used as a pretext by President Iskander Mirza to declare [[martial law]] on 7 October 1958.&lt;ref name="Haqqani2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Husain Haqqani|title=Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nYppZ_dEjdIC&amp;pg=PA37|date=10 March 2010|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|isbn=978-0-87003-285-1|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalia2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ravi Kalia|title=Pakistan’s Political Labyrinths: Military, Society and Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPBWCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133|date=11 August 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-40544-3|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief of army staff [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]] was appointed [[Chief Martial Law Administrator]]. Khan later assumed the presidency by replacing Mirza. All provincial assemblies, including in East Pakistan, were disbanded. Numerous political leaders and journalists were arrested. The Elected Bodies Disqualification Order barred 75 politicians from holding public office for eight years (until 1966).&lt;ref name="Ahmed2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salahuddin Ahmed|title=Bangladesh: Past and Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szfqq7ruqWgC|year=2004|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=978-81-7648-469-5|pages=151–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 Constitution===
The [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1962]] abolished the parliamentary system and introduced a [[presidential]] and [[gubernatorial]] system at the federal and provincial levels respectively. The most important feature of the system was dubbed "Basic Democracy", in which [[electoral college]]s would be responsible for electing the [[President of Pakistan]] and [[Governor]]s of East and [[West Pakistan]].

In 1962, Dacca was declared Pakistan's legislative capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pakistan Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFIdAQAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Information Division, Embassy of Pakistan.|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1960s, the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly was housed in Parliament House in [[Tejgaon]]. The [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] would periodically convene in the same building. The building is now the Prime Minister's Office of Bangladesh.

In 1966, the [[six point movement|six points]] of the Awami League demanded a federal parliamentary democracy.

===Return of Martial Law===
In 1969, President Ayub Khan was deposed by the army chief [[Yahya Khan]]. The [[1969 uprising in East Pakistan]] played a role in the overthrow of President Ayub Khan. The new ruler Yahya Khan organized [[Pakistani general election, 1970|general elections]] in 1970 based on [[universal suffrage]] (the first in Pakistan's history), in which the Awami League won 288 of the 300 seats in East Pakistan's provincial assembly.&lt;ref name="Rahman2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Syedur Rahman|title=Historical Dictionary of Bangladesh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJfcCPUr0OoC&amp;pg=PA101|date=27 April 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7453-4|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971.

===Bangladeshi Constituent Assembly===
Following the Pakistani military crackdown in East Pakistan that began on 25 March 1971, most members of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly and the Bengali members of the National Assembly of Pakistan convened in [[Mujibnagar]] on 17 April 1971, where they signed the [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence]].

==Elections==
===East Bengal legislative election, 1954===
{{main|East Bengali legislative election, 1954}}
The 1954 election in East Bengal was the first election since Pakistan was created. It was held on the basis of [[separate electorate]]s, with reserved seats including 228 for the [[Muslim]] electorate, 30 for the general electorate, 36 for the [[scheduled caste]] electorate, 1 for the [[Pakistani Christians|Pakistan Christian]] electorate, 12 for the [[women]]s' electorate and 1 for the [[Buddhist]] electorate.

The Awami League emerged as the single largest party. However, in response to popular demands, the United Front Legislative Party elected Krishak Sramik Party leader A K Fazlul Huq, a former [[Prime Minister of Bengal]], as Leader of the House. Huq was invited by the governor on 3 April 1954 to form the government. The election ended the dominance of the Muslim League in the politics of East Bengal.&lt;ref name="Lewis2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Lewis|title=Bangladesh: Politics, Economy and Civil Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5lH40gT7xvYC|date=31 October 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50257-3|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; It heralded a younger generation of legislators from the [[vernacular]] middle class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of International Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H7REAQAAIAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Board of Editors of the Journal of International Affairs}}"the ''vernacular elite'' was Bengal- and Bengali-based and represented by Fazlul Huq."&lt;/ref&gt; But verdict had little impact on Pakistan's central leadership and bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="Lewis2011"/&gt;

===East Pakistan general election, 1970===
The 1970 general election broke with the tradition of separate electorates and was organized on the basis of [[universal adult franchise]]. The results are given in the following.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cprid.com/history/5-Baxter%20Election%201970.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly elected assembly could not convene due to the Pakistani military crackdown in East Pakistan. During the Bangladesh War of Independence, the [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence]] was signed by most of its members, which transformed the assembly into a part of the Constituent Assembly of Bangladesh, alongside Bengali members of the National Assembly of Pakistan.

==Ministries==
A total of five ministries (parliamentary governments) were formed by [[Chief Minister]]s in the assembly.

The waste that the writ would issue to prevent would be waste that occurred in response to a lawsuit seeking possession of the land, or a judgment against the waster where possession had not yet been delivered.&lt;ref name="bld"&gt;{{cite book|title=Black's Law Dictionary|year=2009|publisher=[[West (publisher)|West]]|location=St. Paul, Minnesota|isbn=9780314199508|pages=478, 631|edition=Deluxe 9th|editor-first=Bryan A.|editor-last=Garner|editor-link=Bryan A.

In his [[Commentaries on the Laws of England|''Commentaries'']], [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] noted that this common law writ would lie originally to prevent waste that took place between judgment in a real action and delivery of possession by the sheriff. Following the [[Statute of Gloucester]], a writ of estrepement ''pendente placito'' would lie to prevent estrepement pending the outcome of a case. Either writ empowered the sheriff to prevent such waste, allowing him to imprison the waster, and even to raise a [[Posse comitatus (common law)|''posse comitatus'']] to assist him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackstone|first=William|title=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]|year=1768|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=225–227|authorlink=William Blackstone|volume=3|chapter=14. Of Waste|id=3 William Blackstone, ''Commentaries'' *225-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[William Francis Finlason|Finlason]], the basic writ of estrepement was an original writ that had to be sued out of [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancery]], whereas the writ ''pendente placito'' was a writ issued from the bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=John|last2=Finlason|first2=W.

Where the tenant is alleged to have disobeyed the writ, a ''[[venire facias]]'' would issue and the tenant would be [[personal attachment (law)|attached]]. The standard pleading in response was to deny any waste contrary to the writ,&lt;ref&gt;The specific phrase was ''Non fecit vastum contra prohibitionem''. {{harvnb|Garner|2009|p=1153}}. ''See also'' 3 William Blackstone, ''Commentaries'' *227.&lt;/ref&gt; and the issue would be tried by a jury, with the outcome resulting in a conviction for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shumaker|first1=Walter A.|last2=Longsdorf|first2=George Foster|last3=Cahill|first3=James C.|title=The Cyclopedic Law Dictionary|year=1922|publisher=Callaghan &amp; Co.|location=Chicago|pages=368–369|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[John Puckering]] was [[Lord Keeper]], one of his actions was to restrict the issuance of writs of estrepement, as well as other writs such as [[audita querela]], unless he allowed it. [[William Searle Holdsworth|Holdsworth]] suggests this might have been part of an effort to keep the courts of common law from entering into matters of equity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holdsworth|first=W. S.|title=A History of English Law|date=April 1937|publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen &amp; Co.]]|location=London|page=230|edition=2nd|authorlink=William Searle Holdsworth|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While analogous to the [[injunction]] in [[Equity (legal concept)|equity]], one major difference is that the grounds for the issuance of the writ was not the inequitable conduct of the defendant, but that the use of the land in the manner prohibited would work to commit a wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holdsworth|first=W. S.|title=A History of English Law|year=1922|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown &amp; Co.]]|location=London|page=249|authorlink=William Searle Holdsworth|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, unlike injunctions and the [[writ of prohibition]], the writ of estrepement merely stopped further damage, and could not command the repair or replacement of property already damaged. Two important similarities are that both are ''[[in personam]]'' orders, and that disobedience may result in imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raack|first=David W.|title=A History of Injunctions in England before 1700|journal=Indiana Law Journal|year=1986|volume=61|issue=4|page=549|publisher=Indiana University School of Law|location=Bloomington, Indiana|id=61 Ind.

The injunction ultimately supplanted the writ, and the writ was ultimately abolished in England by the [[Real Property Limitation Act 1833]].&lt;ref name="bld" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crompton|first=George|others=Revised and corrected by Baker John Sellon|title=The Practice of The Courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas|year=1813|publisher=Gould, Banks and Gould|location=New York City|page=235|edition=1st American|chapter=15.

== United States ==
In the United States, the writ of estrepement persisted in some state courts for a time, but is rarely used.&lt;ref&gt;93 C.J.S. ''Waste'' § 24.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the 1844 case of ''Brown v. O'Brien'', the writ ''pendente placito'' issued in a Pennsylvania [[ejectment]] case where evidence was proffered indicating that the tenants were in the process of cutting timber and digging for minerals in the land at issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Brown v.

L.J. 454|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aricnljr4&amp;id=460|via=[[HeinOnline]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1929, one law review noted that the injunction had "to a great extent" taken the place of estrepement and common law actions for waste generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Case Notes|journal=Southern California Law Review|date=April 1929|volume=2|issue=4|page=400|publisher=University of Southern California|location=Los Angeles|id=4 S.

In ''Voss v. Green'',&lt;ref&gt;''Voss v. Green'', 389 A.2d 273 (Del. Super.

The court declined to issue the writ, holding that the damage done was not within the scope of the writ, and that the appropriate relief was an injunction, which would have to be obtained in the [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branham|first=Lynn S.|title=Keeping the Wolf out of the Fold: Separation of Powers and Congressional Termination of Equitable Relief|journal=Journal of Legislation|year=2000|volume=26|issue=2|page=212 n.246|publisher=Notre Dame Law School|location=Notre Dame, IN|issn=0146-9584|id=26 J.

'''''FTC v. Balls of Kryptonite''''' is an enforcement action brought in 2009 by the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]]. The defendant was Jaivin Karnani, a [[Southern California]] man, his company Balls of Kryptonite [[Limited Liability Corporation|LLC]], and several other corporate names they [[Doing business as|did business as]]. In 2011 the FTC secured a [[court order]] barring Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite from engaging in many of the deceptive business practices that had brought him to the agency's attention.&lt;ref name="FTC final order"&gt;''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10593716317465713298 FTC v. Jaivin Karnani, Balls of Kryptonite]'',  CV 09-05276 DDP (Ex). ([[United States District Court for the Central District of California|C.D. Cal.]], 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

For several years before the FTC brought its case, Karnani had been selling [[consumer electronic]] devices such as cameras, video game systems and computer software to customers in the [[United Kingdom]]. Despite being physically located in California, he registered his websites in British [[Domain name|domains]], quoted prices in [[Pound sterling|pounds sterling]] and took other steps to suggest that the business was physically located in the U.K. Customers who bought the merchandise at the prices quoted, usually significantly lower than other, established British retailers, found that delivery took in some cases far longer than the promised 48 hours even though their credit cards were charged immediately and they were told they could not cancel their orders. In many cases, the goods they received were inoperable since they had never been intended for sale in the British or European markets, and were thus not protected by [[warranty]].

Complaints to the U.K.'s [[Office of Fair Trading]] (OFT) led to the FTC's enforcement action. In response to its initial complaint&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint"&gt;{{cite web|title=Complaint for Permanent Injunction and Other Equitable Relief|url=http://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/2009/08/090806karnanicmpt.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Trade Commission]]|date=July 20, 2009|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge [[Dean D.

The FTC's decision to pursue the case came in for some criticism. Some commentators, who thought the case title was humorous enough to make extended references to the ''[[Superman]]'' comics in their commentary, questioned whether the commission's action against a retailer who did not deceive any American consumers was a wise use of its limited resources, and whether it might have been better to prosecute him in Britain. Another, in the course of criticizing the failings of the [[European Union]]'s [[Data Protection Directive]] when it came to dealing with [[cloud computing]], did not criticize the enforcement action as such but showed that it pointed out how much more work needed to be done in ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Program.

==Background==

In 2006, the FTC later alleged, Karnani, a resident of [[Pasadena, California]], created two companies, Best Price Brands [[Limited Liability Company|LLC]] and Bite Size Deals LLC. He then registered websites in their names with the [[.uk#Second-level domains|.co.uk]] [[top-level domain]], offering [[consumer electronic]]s such as cameras, video game systems, and computer software. Prices were given in [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]]—often considerably below those charged by other online retailers,&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt; such as £200 for a [[Panasonic]] [[Lumix]] camera or £115 for an eight-[[gigabyte]] [[Zune]], a significant markdown from its official list price of £199.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail story" /&gt;

The domain name and the pound pricing led many visitors to believe that the company was based in the United Kingdom. British consumers began ordering items from the site in late 2006. Many found the goods and services deficient, and even fraudulent.&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt;

For example, the company charged buyers' credit cards for their purchases immediately, promising delivery within 48 hours. Many orders, however, did not ship for weeks. Customers who called or emailed about this were often ignored, with those who persisted and/or supplemented their queries with complaints to the [[Better Business Bureau]] told that there were delays, such as the item being out of stock, which they had never consented to or been informed of prior to their purchase. When they tried to cancel their orders they were informed that "company policy", which they were not made aware of prior to purchase, did not allow them to do so at that point.&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt;

Those to whom goods were delivered were often equally dissatisfied. Instructions were sometimes in Spanish or Chinese, making it difficult to use the product. Some products were shipped with plugs and internal wiring meant for the U.S. market, making them [[mains electricity by country#Table of mains voltages and frequencies|unusable in Britain]] (in a few cases, the company did provide a [[Electric power conversion|power converter]], the FTC conceded). Even products usable in Britain turned out not to have been manufactured for sale there, or in the [[European Union]] (EU) generally, meaning they were not covered by manufacturers' [[warranty|warranties]].&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mail story" /&gt;

Those who attempted to return products met with similar resistance from the website owner, Balls of Kryptonite LLC, which Karnani formed and merged the other two companies into in mid-2007. They were variously told that the time limit for a refund has passed, or that a 50% restocking fee would be deducted from it.&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt; One British customer, who decided to return his camera after fearing it might have been damaged during shipping due to insufficiently protective packaging, was allowed to do so only after agreeing to a 20% discount on his refund.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail story" /&gt;

Customers seeking refunds had to mail the products back at their own expense. Only then did some learn that, despite the domain name, pricing and British address given in some correspondence, the company was actually located in California. This could have made them liable for the [[Tax in the United Kingdom|import taxes]] and [[HM Revenue and Customs|customs duties]] on the goods.&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt;

The company did state its true location on its websites, but not "clearly and conspicuously" enough to offset the perception that they were British, the FTC later said. This deceit had impacts beyond invalidating any warranties. It meant that, contrary to what British buyers may have thought, their country's [[Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000|regulations on mail-ordered products]] did not apply to their purchases. Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite also claimed on their website that they had self-certified their compliance with the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Program]] for protection of personal data, when in fact they had not.&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt;

==Enforcement==

The dissatisfied customers complained to Britain's [[Office of Fair Trading]], which handles consumer protection issues. Officials there got in touch with their counterparts at the FTC in the U.S. They were able to take action due to the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers Beyond Borders Act of 2006, commonly known as the [[SAFE WEB Act]], which [[United States Congress|Congress]] had passed at the commission's request to help them coordinate actions against Internet fraudsters who operate across international boundaries with similar agencies in other countries, such as OFT. Most relevant to its case against Karnani, the legislation had clarified that the FTC had authority over American companies that did business exclusively with customers abroad. Its action against Karnani and Balls of Kryptonite was the first it had undertaken against one.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail story" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2009 FTC press release"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Court Halts U.S. Internet Seller Deceptively Posing as U.K. Home Electronics Site |url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2009/08/court-halts-us-internet-seller-deceptively-posing-uk-home |location=Washington|agency=[[Federal Trade Commission]] |date=August 6, 2009 |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 commissioners voted 4–0 to proceed with the complaint;&lt;ref name="2009 FTC press release" /&gt; it was formally filed later that month in federal court for the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Central District of California]].&lt;ref name="First FTC complaint" /&gt; A week later Judge [[Dean D. Pregerson]] issued a [[temporary restraining order]] barring Karnani, Balls of Kryptonite, any of his other companies (including one he had incorporated in [[Belize]]) and anyone employed by him from misrepresenting the company's physical location or its participation in any program sponsored by a third party through any means and delaying orders without giving the buyer a chance to consent to the delay or cancel it. The order also required that he make corporate financial records available to the FTC on request and not start any new companies without notifying their attorneys.&lt;ref name="Restraining order" /&gt;

He was able to stay in business, however, and the company's websites were promptly changed to state clearly that they were based in the U.S. In papers filed by his defense attorneys in response to the FTC, he claimed that the websites had not tried to hide that the company was based in California and that their address was clearly stated. He disputed some of the allegations of deceptive business practices, noting he had given refunds when products were not compatible with the British electrical system. Only 1% of all his customers, he noted, had disputed their credit card charges.&lt;ref name="Daily Mail story" /&gt;

Two years later, the FTC and Karnani settled the case with a [[consent decree]]. The defendants agreed to make the prohibitions of the 2009 order permanent. They were further barred from processing any transaction until the goods were ready to ship and not disputing any customer [[chargeback]]s made prior to a year before the decree. A $500,000 judgement against the defendants was entered, but suspended due to their inability to pay unless business records submitted in response to the FTC's requests were found to be falsified. Karnani and the other defendants admitted no wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="FTC final order" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Settlement press release"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=FTC Settlement Bans Online U.S. Electronics Retailer from Deceiving Consumers with Foreign Website Names |url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/06/ftc-settlement-bans-online-us-electronics-retailer-deceiving |location=Washington|agency=Federal Trade Commission|date=June 9, 2011 |access-date=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and commentary==

A few weeks after the consent decree, three lawyers at [[Arnold &amp; Porter]] commented on the disposition of the case on their firm's consumer-protection law blog.
{{quote|The FTC's investigation of BOK raises an interesting question as to whether foreign consumers will become the FTC's new [[Lois Lane]], leaving US consumers to be the former childhood sweetheart but still close friend, [[Lana Lang]] ...  While there is nothing in the FTC's mandate that requires it to exclusively protect US consumers, one could question whether this investigation was the most efficient use of the FTC's resources given that that the goods were sold into the UK market and only UK customers were targeted by the allegedly deceptive acts.}}
The references to the [[List of Superman supporting characters|''Superman'' characters]] were a [[running gag]] in the post, prompted by the use of "[[kryptonite]]" in the defendant company's name. "[I]t could also be argued that it would have been more appropriate to prosecute BOK under [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]'s—or rather, the UK’s consumer protection laws," they observed. "With increasingly more commerce being conducted over the Internet, it is likely that cross-border fraud similar to what occurred in this case will become more common," they concluded. "As a result, the FTC may have tough decisions as to where to direct their resources, especially given the current budget crisis."&lt;ref name="Arnold &amp; Porter blog post"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mudge|first1=Amy|last2=Choi|first2=Chester|last3=Watts|first3=Alex|title=Is it a Bird?

'''''Falcis III v. Civil Registrar-General''''' refers to a petition filed by Filipino lawyer Jesus Falcis before the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]. 

The high court was asked about the constitutionality of the provision of the [[Family Code of the Philippines]] defining marriage as "between a man and a woman".

==History==
The petition was filed by Atty. Jesus Falcis in 2015. 

===Oral arguments===
On March 2018, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] approved the scheduling of a same-sex marriage petition that seeks to invalidate Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/philippines-supreme-court-will-hear-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage/#gs.3pEzEX8|title=Philippines Supreme Court will hear arguments on same-sex marriage|date=7 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second week of June 2018, the Supreme Court announced that they will hear arguments in a case seeking the invalidation of the Family Code's provisions prohibiting same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/03/06/18/sc-sets-oral-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage|title=SC sets oral arguments on same-sex marriage|first=Ina Reformina, ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news of the historic oral arguments was also reported by the international media. Duterte also expressed his support for same-sex marriage to be legalized in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/18/philippines-lawyer-gay-marriage-duterte-church|title=Philippine lawyer finds unlikely ally in Duterte in fight to legalise gay marriage|author=Carmela Fonbuena|work=The Guardian|date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First oral arguments====
On June 19, 2018, the first wave of arguments commenced with the following arguments made: whether or not the petition is properly the subject of the exercise of the Supreme Court's power of judicial review, whether or not the right to marry and the right to choose whom to marry are cognates of the right to life and liberty, whether or not the limitation of civil marriage to opposite-sex couples is a valid exercise of police power, whether or not limiting civil marriages to opposite-sex couples violates the Equal Protection Clause, whether or not denying same-sex couples the right to marry amounts to a denial of their right to life and/or liberty without due process of law, whether or not sex-based conceptions of marriage violate religious freedom, whether or not a determination that Articles 1 and 2 of the Family Code are unconstitutional must necessarily carry with it the conclusion that Articles 46(4) and 55(6) of the Family Code (i.e.: homosexuality and lesbianism as grounds for annulment and legal separation) are also unconstitutional, and whether or not the parties are entitled to the [[Prayer for relief|reliefs prayed for]]. The Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) under [[Jose Calida]] argued against the case.&lt;ref name="gmanetwork.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/657294/supreme-court-to-hear-arguments-on-same-sex-marriage-tuesday-june-19-2018/story/|title=Supreme Court to hear arguments on same-sex marriage Tuesday, June 19, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second session of arguments took place on June 26, 2018.&lt;ref name="pink"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/06/19/philippines-supreme-court-hears-legal-challenge-seeking-equal-marriage/|title=Philippines Supreme Court hears legal challenge seeking equal marriage|author=Nick Duffy|work=PinkNews|date=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Supreme Court justices have hinted that the case may be dismissed due to lack of standing, as Falcis did not apply for a marriage license himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/657446/jardeleza-lectures-marriage-equality-petitioner-grave-peril-case-might-be-dismissed/story/ Jardeleza lectures marriage equality petitioner: Grave peril case might be dismissed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Two days after the first arguments occurred, the presidential palace of Philippine President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] stated that it was "too soon for same-sex marriage in the Philippines", causing outrage from various human rights organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/06/21/1826671/palace-too-soon-same-sex-marriage-philippines|title=Palace: Too soon for same-sex marriage in the Philippines|work=Philstar|date=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Senate President Tito Sotto, an ally of the Philippines President, commented: "Same sex union, no problem. Marriage? Debatable", saying that he will vote in favor of same-sex civil unions, a turnaround from previous pronouncements in 2016 and 2017 where he was against both same-sex civil unions and same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/06/21/senators-frown-on-same-sex-marriage/|title=Senators frown on same-sex marriage|work=Manila Bulletin|date=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Definition of Free Cultural Works logo notext.svg|thumb|[[Free Cultural Works]] logo|alt=|219x219px]]
'''Free content''', '''[[Gratis versus libre|libre]] content''', or '''free information''', is any kind of functional work, [[work of art]], or other creative [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] that meets the definition of a [[Definition of Free Cultural Works|free cultural work]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definition ==
A ''free cultural work'' (free content) is, according to the [[definition of Free Cultural Works]], one that has no significant legal restriction on people's freedom to:
*use the content and benefit from using it,
*study the content and apply what is learned,
*make and distribute copies of the content,
*change and improve the content and distribute these derivative works.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freedomdefined.org/Definition |title=Definition of Free Cultural Works |version=1.1 |publisher=freedomdefined.org |author=Erik Möller, e.a. |authorlink=Erik Möller |date=2008 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-doc.html |title=Free Software and Free Manuals |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |date=November 13, 2008 |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free content encompasses all works in the [[public domain]] and also those [[copyright]]ed works whose [[license]]s honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because the [[Berne Convention]] in most countries by default grants copyright holders [[monopoly|monopolistic control]] over their creations, copyright content must be explicitly declared free, usually by the referencing or inclusion of licensing statements from within the work.

Although there are a great many different definitions in regular everyday use, free content is legally very similar, if not like an identical twin, to [[open content]]. An analogy is the use of the rival terms free software and open source, which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html |title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software |last=Stallman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Stallman |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twobits.net/pub/Kelty-TwoBits.pdf |title=The Cultural Significance of free Software - Two Bits |first=Christpher M. |last=Kelty |publisher=[[Duke University]] press - durham and london |year=2008 |pages=99 |quote=''Prior to 1998, Free Software referred either to the Free Software Foundation (and the watchful, micromanaging eye of Stallman) or to one of thousands of different commercial, avocational, or university-research projects, processes, licenses, and ideologies that had a variety of names: sourceware, freeware, shareware, open software, public domain software, and so on. The term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raymondCall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/open-source.html |title=Goodbye, "free software"; hello, "open source" |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]]'s ''[[The Open Definition|Open Definition]]'' describes "open" as synonymous to the definition of ''free'' in the "Definition of Free Cultural Works" (as also in the [[Open Source Definition]] and [[Free Software Definition]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] on opendefinition.org ''"This essential meaning matches that of "open" with respect to software as in the Open Source Definition and is synonymous with "free" or "libre" as in the Free Software Definition and Definition of Free Cultural Works."''&lt;/ref&gt; For such free/open content both movements recommend the same three [[Creative Commons license]]s, the [[CC BY]], [[CC BY-SA]], and [[CC0]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ licenses] on opendefinition.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2013/12/27/creative-commons-4-0-by-and-by-sa-licenses-approved-conformant-with-the-open-definition/ Creative Commons 4.0 BY and BY-SA licenses approved conformant with the Open Definition] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (December 27th, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://blog.creativecommons.org/2014/10/07/open-definition-2-0-released/ Open Definition 2.0 released] by Timothy Vollmer on creativecommons.org (October 7th, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WellcomeTrustReport" /&gt;

==Legal matters==
===Copyright===
[[File:Copyright.svg|thumb|100px|[[copyright]]]]
{{Main article|Copyright}}
Copyright is a legal concept, which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the [[copying|duplication]] and public performance of his or her work. In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the [[public domain]]. Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works. During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a [[fair use]].
Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the authors content, or limit their use to fair use. Secondly it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/ |title=The Importance of Orphan Works Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as [[Mashup (music)|mashup]]s and collaborative content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0144818801000710|title=Fair use and copyright protection: a price theory explanation |journal=International Review of Law and Economics|author=Ben Depoorter|author2= Francesco Parisi|doi=10.1016/S0144-8188(01)00071-0 |year=2002 |volume=21|issue=4|page=453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public domain===
[[File:PD-icon.svg|thumb|100px|[[public domain]]]]
{{Main article|Public domain}}
The public domain is a range of creative works whose [[copyright]] has expired, or was never established; as well as ideas and facts&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The copyright status of uncreative aggregates of basic data may differ by region, for the USA see ''[[Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service]]'', for [[Australia]], see ''[[Telstra v Desktop Marketing Systems]]''&lt;/ref&gt; which are ineligible for copyright. A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public, or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise utilize the work, without legal ramifications. A work in the public domain or released under a permissive licence may be referred to as "[[copycenter]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/copycenter.html |title=Copycenter |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |publisher=The [[Jargon File]] |accessdate=August 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyleft===
{{main|Copyleft}}
[[File:Copyleft.svg|thumb|100px|[[copyleft]]]]
Copyleft is a play on the word copyright and describes the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work.&lt;ref name="Dusollier"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Open source and copyleft. Authorship reconsidered?|author=Dusollier, S|series=Columbia journal of Law and the Arts|year=2003|volume=26|issue=296}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable non-author parties to be able to reuse and, in many licensing schemes, modify content that is created by an author. Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work. Copyleft licenses require that any [[derivative work]]s be distributed under the same terms, and that the original copyright notices be maintained.
A symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the [[copyright symbol]], facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right. Unlike the copyright symbol, the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=G. Brent |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |title=Open Source Approaches in Spatial Data Handling |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZNuu8XODQMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=copyleft+symbol+legal+meaning |isbn=3-540-74830-X |accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Projects that provide free content exist in several areas of interest, such as software, academic literature, general literature, music, images, video, and [[engineering]].
Technology has reduced the cost of publication and reduced the entry barrier sufficiently to allow for the production of widely disseminated materials by individuals or small groups. Projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that is associated with the development of computer technology. Such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments.

===Media===
[[File:Cc.logo.circle.svg|thumb|100px|[[Creative Commons]]]]
In media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by [[Creative Commons licenses|Creative Commons]] have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions. Not all of the Creative Commons’ licenses are entirely free: their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistribution-only licensing. Since February 2008, Creative Commons licenses which are entirely free carry a badge indicating that they are "approved for free cultural works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/8051 |title=Approved for Free Cultural Works |accessdate=March 22, 2009| last=Linksvayer |first=Mike |authorlink=Mike Linksvayer |date= February 20, 2008| publisher=[[Creative Commons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital library|Repositories]] exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs, [[clip art]], music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irate.sourceforge.net/ |title=iRate Radio |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |publisher=[[SourceForge.net]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228222010/http://irate.sourceforge.net/ |archivedate=February 28, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and literature,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:No_Cost_or_Freedom%3F |title=Gutenberg:No Cost or Freedom? |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |date=April 23, 2007 |publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal, it is usually not sensible because of the [[duplicate content]] problem. [[Wikipedia]] is amongst the most well known databases of user uploaded free content on the web. While the vast majority of content on Wikipedia is free content, some copyrighted material is hosted under [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|Fair-use criteria]].

===Software===
[[File:Opensource.svg|thumb|right|100px|[[Open Source Initiative|OSI]] logo]]
[[File:FSF-Logo_part.svg|thumb|right|100px|[[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] logo]]
{{main article|Free and open-source software}}
[[Free and open-source software]], which is also often referred to as [[open source software]] and [[free software]], is a maturing technology with major companies utilising free software to provide both services and technology to both end users and technical consumers. The ease of dissemination has allowed for increased modularity, which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration.
Open source development models have been classified as having a similar peer-recognition and collaborative benefit incentives that are typified by more classical fields such as scientific research, with the social structures that result from this incentive model decreasing production cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/staff/herkia/kava/Seminnarit/MI_mustonen.pdf |title=Copyleft – the economics of Linux and other open source software |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |version=Discussion Paper No. 493 |last=Mustonen |first=Mikko |publisher=Department of Economics, [[University of Helsinki]] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given sufficient interest in a software component, by using [[peer-to-peer]] distribution methods, distribution costs of software may be reduced, removing the burden of infrastructure maintenance from developers. As distribution resources are simultaneously provided by consumers, these software distribution models are scalable, that is the method is feasible regardless of the number of consumers. In some cases, free software vendors may use peer-to-peer technology as a method of dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/28/33/44/PDF/RR-6519.pdf |title=The Practice of Free and Open Source Software Processes |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |volume=N° 6519 |issue=April 2008 |date=May 29, 2008 |version=inria-00274193, version 2 |author1=Pawlak, Michel |author2=Bryce, Ciarán |author3=Laurière, Stéphane |journal=Rapport de recherche |publisher=[[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique]] (INRIA) |issn=0249-6399 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, project hosting and code distribution is not a problem for the most of free projects as [[Comparison of open source software hosting facilities|a number of providers]] offer them these services free.

===Engineering and technology===
[[File:Open-source-hardware-logo.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open source hardware]] logo]]
Free content principles have been translated into fields such as engineering, where designs and engineering knowledge can be readily shared and duplicated, in order to reduce overheads associated with project development. [[Open design]] principles can be applied in engineering and technological applications, with projects in [[mobile telephony]], small-scale manufacture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestandard.com/news/2008/03/04/reprap-open-source-3d-printer-masses |title=RepRap: An open-source 3D printer for the masses |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Hendry |first=Andrew |date=March 4, 2008 |work=[[Computerworld]] Australia |publisher=[[The Industry Standard]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the automotive industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/tr/Das-offenste-aller-Autos--/artikel/68663/ |title=The most open of all cars |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Honsig |first= Markus |date=January 25, 2006 |work=[[Technology Review]] |publisher=[[Heinz Heise]] |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/drive/australian-drive-for-green-commuter-cars-20100613-y64q.html|title=Australian drive for green commuter cars|date=14 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=Sydney |accessdate=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even agricultural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isb.vt.edu/news/2005/artspdf/dec0501.pdf |title=Open-source Agriculture |accessdate=March 22, 2009 |last=Stewart Jr. |first=C. Neal |date=December 2005 |work= ISB News Report |publisher=Information Systems for Biotechnology (ISB) |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Technologies such as distributed manufacturing can allow [[computer-aided manufacturing]] and [[computer-aided design]] techniques to be able to develop small-scale production of components for the development of new, or repair of existing, devices. Rapid fabrication technologies underpin these developments, which allow end users of technology to be able to construct devices from pre-existing blueprints, using software and manufacturing hardware to convert information into physical objects.

===Academia===
[[File:Open Access logo PLoS white.svg|thumb|100px|[[Open access (publishing)|open access]]]]
{{main article|Open access (publishing)}}
In academic work, the majority of works are not free, although the percentage of works that are open access is growing rapidly. [[Open access]] refers to online [[research]] outputs that are free of all restrictions on access (e.g. access tolls) and free of many restrictions on use (e.g. certain copyright and license restrictions).&lt;ref name="earlham.edu"&gt;Suber, Peter.

For teaching purposes, some universities, including MIT, provide freely available course content, such as lecture notes, video resources and tutorials. This content is distributed via Internet resources to the general public. Publication of such resources may be either by a formal institution-wide program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/web/about/about/index.htm|title=About OpenCourseWare|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternately via informal content provided by individual academics or departments.

===Legislation===
Any country has its own law and legal system, sustained by its legislation, a set of law-documents &amp;mdash; documents containing [[Statutory law|statutory]] [[:Category:Law of obligations|obligation rules]], usually [[law]] and created by [[legislature]]s.  In a [[Rule of law|democratic country]], each law-document is published as [[#Media|open media content]], is in principle a free content; but in general there are no explicit license attributed for each law-document, so the license must be interpreted, is a ''[[implied license]]''.
Only few countries have explicit licenses in its law-documents, as the UK's [[Open Government Licence]] (a [[CC-BY]] compatible license).
In the other countries, the ''implied license'' comes from its proper rules (general laws and rules about copyright in government works). The automatic protection provided by [[Berne Convention]] not apply to law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection.
It is also possible to "inherit" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories. Examples of law-document open repositories: [[LexML Brazil]], [[Legislation.gov.uk]], [[EUR-Lex#N-Lex|N-Lex of EU countries]]. In general a law-document is offered in more than one (open) official version, but the main one is that published by a [[government gazette]]. So, law-documents can eventually inherit license expressed by the repository or by the gazette that contains it.

[[File:Stilettos-heels-b.JPG|thumb|A pair of [[court shoe|pumps/court shoes]] with {{convert|12|cm|frac=4|abbr=in}} stiletto heels]]
A '''high heel policy''' is a regulation or law about the wearing of [[high heels]], which may be required or forbidden in different places and circumstances.

Historically, high heels were used by aristocratic women for cosmetic reasons, to raise their height or to keep their feet and long dresses clean.  The style was then subject to [[sumptuary law|sumptuary]] laws.  In more modern times, [[stiletto heels]] have been restricted when they might damage the floor surface or cause accidents.

Some [[dress code]]s, however, require women to wear high heels so that they appear to be taller and more attractive.  Such footwear may be painful and damage the feet, and there have been repeated protests by women workers against such policies.  In 2016, a British receptionist was dismissed for not wearing high heels and she then started a petition which attracted sufficient support to be considered by the UK Parliament.

== Regulations preventing the wearing of high heels ==

===In history===
In 1430, ''[[chopine]]s'' were {{convert|30|in|cm|0}} high, at times. [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] law then limited the height to three inches—but this regulation was widely ignored.&lt;ref name="DeMello2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C&amp;pg=PA311|year=2009|publisher=Greenwood Press/ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35714-5|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 17th-century law in [[Massachusetts]] announced that women would be subjected to the same treatment as witches if they lured men into marriage via the use of high-heeled shoes.&lt;ref name=demello323&gt;{{cite book|author=Margo DeMello|title=Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LKTACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA323|date=10 September 2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35715-2|page=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, an act was introduced into the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British parliament]] which would have applied the same penalties as witchcraft to the use of high heels and other cosmetic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Manners and Customs of the English Nation |author=John Brookes |pages=261–262 |publisher=James Blackwood |year=1859 |quote=In the year 1770 an act was introduced into Parliament against hoops, false hair, high heels...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Floor surface concerns===
The pressure under a stiletto heel is greater (per unit of the very small area) than that under the feet of an elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/JackGreen.shtml|title=Pressure Under High Heels|last=Green|first=Jack|year=2003|accessdate= 20 December 2012|publisher= ''The Physics Factbook''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as  the very narrow [[stiletto heel]] became more widespread in the 1950s, the owners of many types of buildings became concerned about the effects of large numbers of such heels on their floors, especially in historic and high-traffic public buildings. Specifically, there was concern that the heels would either damage certain types of floor covering or cause minor accidents through heels getting jammed in floor-grills, the gaps in planking, or uneven surfaces. Soft outdoor ground also caused problems, affecting both the surface and the wearer.   Wood flooring was the most vulnerable, but carpets, [[linoleum]], and mosaic floors were also considered at risk of damage.  Signs were frequently posted attempting to ban stiletto heels, though they were generally ineffective.  A 1963 article in a US building maintenance magazine stated, "Replacement of floors is estimated to have cost at least half a billion dollars throughout the country since the advent of the stiletto heel fashion."&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Sanitation and Building Maintenance'', Volume 15, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

When stiletto heels were first sold in Africa, many of the wearers fell through the floors of their homes, not realizing that the floor timbers had been partly removed by [[termite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut van Emden, ''Handbook of Agricultural Entomology'', 2013, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1118469593}}, 9781118469590, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=79ELgtB-yQQC&amp;pg=PT101 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  The  [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] claimed in 1963 that "with style changes the stiletto-heel problem has diminished".&lt;ref&gt;''United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service, research note, Forest Products Laboratory'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

High heels can represent [[contributory negligence]] by the [[plaintiff]] in American [[personal injury]] cases involving [[slip and fall]] accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Gary M. Bakken, H. Harvey Cohen, Jon R. Abele, ''Slips, Trips, Missteps, and Their Consequences'', p. 170, Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, 2007, {{ISBN|1933264012}}, 9781933264011, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aWatvfoR7vQC&amp;pg=PA170 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many high heel policies in the US are related to concerns over the potential for legal claims.{{Citation needed|date = June 2016}}

== Regulations requiring the wearing of high heels ==

=== In media and fashion ===
Some women have challenged the expectation that women should wear high heels in formal social situations. In 2015, a group of women were turned away from a film première at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in France for wearing flat shoes, including a woman physically unable to wear heels due to an operation on one of her feet.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/cannes-festival/emily-blunt-cannes-heel-row/|title=Emily Blunt on Cannes heels row: 'everybody should wear flats'|website=The Telegraph|language=en-GB|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women complained that this was a sexist policy which forced women into a stereotyped appearance; festival organisers later responded that there was no official policy on footwear and stated that they would remind red carpet officials of this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/cannes-denies-high-heel-rule-women-red-carpet-173653799.html?ref=gs|title=Cannes denies high-heel rule for women on red carpet|website=www.yahoo.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In workplaces===
Guidelines on acceptable [[dress code]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the workplace are permitted by Canadian law in order to ensure that employees are able to complete their work safely and effectively.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millerthomson.com/en/blog/canadian-labour-employment-law-blog/high-heels-in-the-workplace-could-be-high|title=Canadian Labour &amp; Employment Law Blog {{!}} High Heels in the Workplace could be High Risk for Employers {{!}} Miller Thomson|website=www.millerthomson.com|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the inclusion of the wearing of high heels in these guidelines has created controversy. Some workplace studies show that women in the hospitality industry who wear high heels have suffered injuries after tripping, falling or slipping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, requirements for appearance which differ for male and female employees have the potential to be considered discriminatory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the mid-1990s, several US-based airlines required female [[flight attendants]] to wear shoes with heels. Minimum heel heights ranged from one-half inch to the two inches mandated by [[USAir]].&lt;ref name=marc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=law_pubs |author=Marc Linder |title=Smart Women, Stupid Shoes, and Cynical Employers |publisher=[[University of Iowa]] |date=1 January 1997 |accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight attendants at times avoided censure by changing into more comfortable shoes during flights, since their supervisors were less likely to be present there.&lt;ref name="Banaszak-HollLevitsky2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jane C. Banaszak-Holl |author2=Sandra R. Levitsky |author3=Mayer N. Zald |title=Social Movements and the Transformation of American Health Care |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OePEMr_9l0wC&amp;pg=PA294 |date=24 June 2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-974214-1 |page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the UK [[Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists]] released a report outlining the dangers of wearing high heels for extended periods and approached unions and employers to collaborate on measures to ensure risk assessments would be completed on women's footwear, and to offer alternatives to high heels where these were deemed unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-shoes-heels-idUSTRE58F3WL20090916|title=UK unions spark debate over high heels at work|date=16 September 2009|newspaper=Reuters|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies that force women to wear heels have been challenged in a number of locations. In 2001, [[cocktail waitress]]es in [[Las Vegas]] organised a "Kiss My Foot" campaign which was successful in getting casinos to relax their requirement to wear high heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=43 |title=Casino Women: Courage in Unexpected Places |first1=Susan |last1=Chandler |first2=Jill |last2=Jones |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780801450143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, waitresses at three restaurant chains in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]], Canada, claimed that they were required to wear high heels at work despite complaining of pain and injury. Management responded that there was no written policy on wearing high heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2052233/original-joes-boston-pizza-servers-claim-mandatory-high-heel-policies/ |title=Original Joe's, Boston Pizza servers claim mandatory high heel policies |last=Hart |first=Danielle |website=Global News |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the Israeli airline [[El Al]] introduced a requirement that female flight attendants wear high heels until passengers had been seated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2063591/i-dont-think-the-girls-thought-they-could-question-it-high-heels-policy-study-author/|title='I don't think the girls thought they could question it': high heels policy study author |last=Tucker |first=Erika |website=Global News |access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline's workers' union stated that the requirement would endanger the health and safety of the flight attendants and instructed its members to ignore the rule.

Similar policies were tested again in the UK in 2016 when a [[temporary work|temporary receptionist]], [[Nicola Thorp]], was sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code at the office of accountants [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]. Outsourcing firm Portico stated that Thorp "had signed the appearance guidelines" but after Thorp launched an online petition—"Make it illegal for a company to require women to wear high heels at work"—the firm changed their policy. The new guideline states that all female employees "can wear plain flat shoes or plain court shoes as they prefer."&lt;ref name="Guard-1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Chris |title=Woman's high-heel petition receives 100,000-plus signatures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/nicola-thorp-high-heel-petition-receives-100000-plus-signatures|accessdate=13 May 2016|work=the Guardian|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition gained widespread support from public figures such as Scotland's First Minister [[Nicola Sturgeon]] and [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] [[Caroline Dinenage]], [[Margot James]] and [[Tulip Siddiq]].&lt;ref name="McIntosh"&gt;{{cite news|last=McIntosh|first=Lindsay|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/heel-loving-sturgeon-steps-into-shoe-debate-vv2nlh825 |title=Heel-loving Sturgeon steps into shoe debate |work=The Times|location=London |date=16 May 2016|accessdate=7 March 2017}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tele-1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yorke|first1=Harry|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/12/firm-accused-of-sexism-in-high-heels-row-forced-to-change-its-dr/ |title=MPs back temp worker’s campaign to end 'sexist' high heel policy |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=12 May 2016 |accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two parliamentary committees in January 2017 decided that Portico had broken the law; the company had already changed its terms of employment.&lt;ref name="McIntosh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/world/europe/uk-parliament-nicola-thorp-heels.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|title=British Woman’s Revolt Against High Heels Becomes a Cause in Parliament|work=The New York Times|date=6 March 2017|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The petition gained over 130,000 signatures, sufficient for a debate in the British parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kaur Grewal|first=Herpreet |url=http://www.fm-world.co.uk/news/fm-industry-news/temps-high-heels-petition-heads-for-parliament/ |title=Temp's 'high heels' petition heads for Parliament |date=17 May 2016 |journal=FM World}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place on 6 March 2017, when MPs decided the UK government should change the law to prevent the demand being made by employers.&lt;ref name="Hansard"&gt;{{cite hansard |jurisdiction=United Kingdom |title=Workplace Dress Codes (High Heels) |url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-03-06/debates/58CDA5AC-D655-43F4-BDD8-3D1370BCB076/WorkplaceDressCodes%28HighHeels%29 |house=[[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]] |date= 6 March 2017 |column_start=198WH |column_end=216WH |speaker=[[Helen Jones]] |position=the [[Member of parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] for [[Warrington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Warrington North]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; However, this was rejected by the government in April 2017 as they stated that existing legislation was "adequate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39667912|title=High heels row: Petition for work dress code law rejected|date=21 April 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=21 April 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, the Canadian province of [[British Columbia]] amended workplace legislation to prevent employers from requiring women to wear high heels at work. British Columbia premier [[Christy Clark]] stated that the government was "changing this regulation to stop this unsafe and discriminatory practice."&lt;ref name="guardian-8apr2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Collig|first1=Pádraig|title=Canadian province makes it illegal to require women to wear high heels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/apr/08/canadian-province-makes-it-illegal-to-require-women-to-wear-high-heels|accessdate=8 April 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2017, [[the Philippines]] forbid companies from mandating that female employees have to wear high heels at work.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-women/philippines-bans-mandatory-high-heels-at-work-idUSL8N1M637F&lt;/ref&gt;

'''In open court''' is a legal term in the [[United States]] defined by the appearance by a party or their [[Lawyer|attorney]] in a public [[court]] session such as during a [[trial]].  Normally, the public may be present at trials, hearings and similar routine matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legaldictionary.thefreedictionary.com/open+court Legal dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States constitutional law==
Under [[Article III of the United States Constitution|Article III]], Section 3 of the [[United States Constitution]]:
{{quote|No Person shall be convicted of [[Treason]] unless on the [[Testimony]] of two [[Witness]]es to the same [[Overt act|overt Act]], or on [[Confession (law)|Confession]] '''in open Court'''|U.S. Const., Art. III, § 3 (''emphasis added'').&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 3 3|Wikisource of Article III]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the United States, the [[constitution]] guarantees [[criminal law|criminal]] [[Criminal defendant|defendants]] the right to a "speedy and public trial" under the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]].  The Sixth Amendment also grants the defendant the right to appear on his or her own behalf requiring leave of the Court in complex criminal cases, and standby counsel may still be required by the judge.

==Distinguishing rules==
Many courts dealing with [[children]] or [[minor (law)|minor]]s, such as the [[New York Surrogate's Court]], [[Probate Court]], [[Family court]], [[juvenile court]], or widow's and orphan's court do ''not'' normally hold sessions in open court.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Appearance in open court is distinguished from an appearance in [[Chambers (law)|a judge's chambers]].&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Japan-Korea Protocol of August 1905''' was made between representatives of the [[Empire of Japan]] and the [[Korean Empire]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, James Brown. (1921). [https://books.google.com/books?id=BdoAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Japan+korea+treaty+of+1905&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AFbXTNLoO8OBlAfewN38CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Japan%20korea%20treaty%20of%201905&amp;f=false  ''Korea, Treaties and Agreements,'' p. vii.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Negotiations were concluded on August 13, 1905.&lt;ref name="mission35"&gt;Korean Mission to the Conference on the Limitation of Armament, Washington, D.C., 1921–1922. (1922). {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|''Korea's Appeal,'' p. 35.|page=35}}; excerpt, "Alleged Treaty, dated August 13, 1905."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty provisions==
This treaty granted permission to Japanese vessels to navigate coastal and inland waters of Korea.&lt;ref name="mission35"/&gt;

The treaty preamble asserted that the [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] of His Majesty the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the [[Emperor of Korea]] were "respectively duly empowered" to negotiate and to agree upon the specific language of the proposed bilateral treaty:&lt;ref name="scott44"&gt;Scott, {{Google books|BdoAAAAAYAAJ|p. 44.|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Article I.

Japanese vessels shall be at liberty to navigate along the coasts and in inland waters of Korea for the purpose of trade in accordance with the stipulations of the present Agreement, which, however, shall not be applicable to navigation between the open ports.&lt;ref name="scott44"/&gt;
* Article II.

Licenses shall be obtained for all Japanese vessels to be employed in navigation of the coasts and inland waters, upon reporting through the Japanese Consular Officers to the Korean Customs the names and residence of the owners, the names, types and carrying capacity of the vessels, as well as the limits within which such vessels are to navigate.  Licenses shall be available for one year from the date of their issue.&lt;ref name="scott44"/&gt;
* Article III.

Upon receipt of the licenses, fees shall be paid to the Korean Customs ....&lt;ref name="scott44"/&gt;
* Article IV.

Japanese vessels may freely navigate within the limits specified, but shall not proceed to any place not in Korean territory, except in case of stress of weather or other emergency, or in case special permission has been obtained from the Korean Customs.&lt;ref name="scott45"&gt;Scott, {{Google books|BdoAAAAAYAAJ| p. 45.|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article V.

The licenses shall be carried on board the vessels during their voyages and shall be shown whenever requested by the Korean Customs, or by local officials of Korea, or by the Chiefs of villages duly authorized by such local officials.&lt;ref name="scott45"/&gt;
* Article VI.

Japanese shipowners shall have liberty to lease land for the purpose of building warehouses at the places where their vessels call.  Such owners may also construct piers or wharves on the banks and coasts with the permission of the Korean Customs.&lt;ref name="scott45"/&gt;
* Article VII.

In case of infraction of the present Agreement by a Japanese vessel, the Korean Customs may cause the license of such vessel to be confiscated, or may refuse to issue a new one, if the offence be found, upon examination, to be of a grave nature.&lt;ref name="scott45"/&gt;
* Article VIII.

When a Japanese vessel, or the crew thereof, infringes the stipulations of the present Agreement or of other treaties, or when a member of the crew commits any crime, the Japanese Consular Officers shall deal with the case in accordance with the provisions of the treaties and the laws of Japan.&lt;ref name="scott45"/&gt;
* Article. IX.

The present Agreement shall remain in force for a period of fifteen years from the date of its signature, and after the expiration of such period, further arrangements may be made by mutual agreement.&lt;ref name="scott45"/&gt;
:::[[Hayashi Gonsuke (diplomat)|Hayashi Gonsuke]], [[Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]] (dated, the 13th day of the 8th month of the 38th year of Meiji)&lt;ref name="scott45"/&gt;

==Recision==
[[Image:Eulsa retraction.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]]'s analysis of the "treaty of 1905" &amp;ndash; just one of many efforts to invalidate the consequences of a coercive process.]]
This "alleged treaty" was contrived in a coercive process;&lt;ref name="mission35"/&gt; and Koreans sought to invalidate the unwanted consequences by presenting evidence to the international community.  For example, 
* 1905: [[Emperor Gojong of the Korean Empire]] wrote personally to the heads of state in those countries having treaties with Korea; and the Korean government filed formal appeals and sent formal cable notices,&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ| p. 44.|page=44}}; excerpt, "The foregoing are in addition to the appeal of the Emperor of Korea, filed in the State Department on November 25, 1905, and his cable notice of the illegality of the claimed protectorate, filed in the State Department on November 26, 1905."&lt;/ref&gt; but these diplomatic gestures were unavailing.
* 1907: In what is sometimes called the "[[Hague Secret Emissary Affair]]," Korean emissaries sought unsuccessfully to seek international assistance at the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)#Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Convention of 1907]] at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Carter J. '' et al.'' (1990). ''Korea Old and New: A History,'' p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1921: Korean representatives attempted to gain a hearing at the [[Washington Naval Conference]] of 1921;&lt;ref&gt;Korean Mission {{Google books|9OdAAAAAYAAJ|pp. 3-44.|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the effort was ineffective.

This treaty was confirmed to be "''already [[null and void]]''" by [[Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea]] concluded in 1965.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Basic_Relations_between_Japan_and_the_Republic_of_Korea|title=Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea}}
"''It is confirmed that all treaties or agreements concluded between the Empire of Japan and the Empire of Korea on or before August 22, 1910 are already null and void.''"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Japan argued that the chronological point of reference for "already null and void" was August 15, 1948, when the government of the Republic of Korea was established.  This point of view is disputed by the Korean analysis, which construes the 1965 treaty as acknowledgment of the nullification of all Japanese-Korean treaties and agreements from 1904 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Lee Man-yeol.

From 1994 to 1996, Sax worked with the [[Clinton Administration]] under Interior Secretary [[Bruce Babbitt]].&lt;ref name="berkeley-profile" /&gt;

{{See also|Judicial Review|Courts in Ireland}}

'''Judicial review in the Republic of Ireland''' is a way for the Superior Courts to supervise the [[Oireachtas]] to make sure that legislation does not conflict with the Constitution.
"Superior Courts" refers to either the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court of Ireland]], the [[Court of Appeal (Ireland)|Court of Appeal of Ireland]] or the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]] and is a specific reference to the greater width of their [[jurisdiction]] in comparison to Ireland's lower courts (that is, the [[District Court (Ireland)|District Court]] and the [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|Circuit Court]]).
An applicant for judicial review in Ireland must start by applying for leave to seek judicial review. This acts as a filter of entirely spurious or unfounded matters. Having been granted leave, the applicant must then remake the entire application for judicial review whereupon the Court will set a date for hearing.

All judicial review in Ireland is conducted by the High Court unless the applicant wants a review of any decision, activity, ruling or rule of the High Court whereby the review is conducted by the Supreme Court (including appeals of decisions previously made in High Court judicial reviews)

{{Conflict of laws}}

'''''Lex loci protectionis''''' (Latin: "[the] law of the place where the protection is [claimed]") is a [[choice of law]] rule applied to cases concerning the infringement of [[intellectual property]] (IP) rights, such as [[copyright]]s or [[patent]]s. 

It stipulates that the law applied to such cases is the law of the ''locus protectionis'', that is, the law of the country for which legal protection for the intellectual property is claimed.&lt;ref name="Rosen 2012 p. 57"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Jan|title=Individualism and Collectiveness in Intellectual Property Law|year=2012|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=9780857938978|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuCx7saXmjwC&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the law of the country where the intellectual property was created or registered is not applied.

''Lex loci protectionis'' is generally accepted as the prevailing choice of law rule for IP rights, at least as concerns the existence, validity, scope and duration of the rights.&lt;ref name="Rosen 2012 p. 57" /&gt; Article 8 (1) of the [[European Union]]'s [[Rome II Regulation]] codifies it as follows:
{{quote|The law applicable to a non-contractual obligation arising from an infringement of an intellectual property right shall be the law of the country for which protection is claimed.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4353">'''Moral authority''' is authority premised on principles, or fundamental truths, which are independent of written, or positive, laws. As such, moral authority necessitates the existence of and adherence to truth. Because truth does not change, the principles of moral authority are immutable or unchangeable, although as applied to individual circumstances the dictates of moral authority for action may vary due to the exigencies of human life. These principles, which can be of metaphysical or religious nature, are considered normative for behavior, whether they are or are not also embodied in written laws,&lt;ref&gt;[http://definitions.uslegal.com/m/moral-authority/ Legal Definitions: Moral Authority]&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the community is ignoring or violating them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oqYtU5iObYYC&amp;pg=PA86 Richard Norris, Timothy F. Sedgwick, ''The Business of All Believers: Reflections on Leadership'' (Church Publishing, Inc. 2009 ISBN 978-1-59627119-7), p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the authoritativeness or force of moral authority is applied to the [[conscience]] of each individual, who is free to act according to or against its dictates.

Moral authority has thus also been defined as the "fundamental assumptions that guide our perceptions of the world".&lt;ref&gt; James Davison Hunter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KTiTxl-rY9AC&amp;pg=PA119 ''Culture Wars''] (Basic Books 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-46501534-4}}), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An individual or a body of people who are seen as communicators of such principles but which does not have the physical power to enforce them on the unwilling are spoken of as having or being a moral authority. An example is the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor_en.html Full text of Veritas Splendor], English Translation. John Paul II. August 6, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

In this sense, moral authority has been defined as "the capacity to convince others how the world should be", as opposed to epistemic authority, "the capacity to convince others of how the world is".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouriwestern.edu/orgs/polanyi/TAD%20WEB%20ARCHIVE/TAD36-3/TAD36-3-fnl-pg17-30-pdf.pdf Jay A. Labinger, "Individual or Institutional Authority in Science?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing focuses==

Since the [[Age of Enlightenment]], traditional sources of moral authority such as church or state have been viewed with increasing suspicion in Western culture:&lt;ref&gt;S. Sims ed., ''The Routledge Companion to Postmodernism'' (2012) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps indeed all claims to moral authority.&lt;ref&gt;Niamh Stephenson, ''Theoretical Psychology'' (2003) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of guides, entertainers; in place of ideals, stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Mosley, ''Dumbing Down'' (2000) p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Expertise, or alternatively what [[Emmanuel Levinas]] called the tyranny of opinion,&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; or else an appeal to science,&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Brown, ''Imperfect Oracle'' (2009) p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; may be looked to for alternative sources of moral authority; or there may be a [[postmodern]] revulsion from all [[grand narrative]]s which might ground such narratives &lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; in favour of [[moral relativism]].

Where a figure still wields some degree of moral authority, this may be attributed in large part to his modernist reticence, lack of dogma, and capacity for self-doubt&lt;ref&gt;Bernard O'Donoghue ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney'' (2009) p. 11 and p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– as opposed for example to the unchallenged moral authority for centuries attributed to [[Virgil]] as a ''norma vivendi''.{{Translation needed inline}}&lt;ref&gt;M. Tudeau-Clayton, ''Jonson, Shakespeare and Early Modern Virgil'' (1998) p. 26 and p. 72-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the erosion of sources of moral authority, [[Late Modernity]] has also seen the appearance of various forms of [[fundamentalism]], from a range of religious types to [[market fundamentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sims, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4052">'''Operation Return to Sender''' is the name for a massive sweep of [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) agency that began on May 26, 2006.

According to ICE, the campaign has focused on individuals deemed to be the most dangerous, including convicted felons and gang members, particularly those of the notorious [[Mara Salvatrucha]] (MS-13) gang, as well as repeat offenders, some of whom had already been [[deportation|deported]]. As of late April 2007, over 23,000 illegal immigrants had been arrested.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/28/washington/28immig.html?ref=us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
On Sept. 19, 2006 ICE conducted a sting operation and arrested 11 immigrants in [[Danbury, Connecticut]] who came to be known as "The Danbury 11."&lt;ref&gt;http://clubs.ccsu.edu/recorder/editorial/editorial_item.asp?NewsID=73&lt;/ref&gt; A federal agent disguised himself as a contractor and enlisted the men to work on a construction site before handing them over to ICE. 9 of the 11 were later released on bail.
In January 2007, due to a major push within Operation Return to Sender, raids in the [[Los Angeles]] Metro area netted 338 illegal immigrants who were arrested at their homes and apartments and 423 who were identified in area jails since Jan. 17. Those already jailed will be transferred to federal custody when they finish serving their state sentences, said Virginia Kice, spokeswoman for [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].

The sweep netted illegal immigrants from 14 countries in all, including [[Mexico]], [[Honduras]], [[Ukraine]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Poland]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].

An ICE press release from June 14, 2006 claims that Operation Return to Sender ended June 13, 2006 and brought in "More Than 2,100 Criminal Aliens, Gang Members, Fugitives and Other Immigration Violators".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dhs.gov/xnews/releases/press_release_0926.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is contradicted by numerous citations that the operation is ongoing, including one&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/news/local/states/california/16867654.htm&lt;/ref&gt; from the ''Contra Costa Times'' newspaper dated March 9, 2007, which quotes ICE as having arrested 13,000 more people from mid-June 2006 through January 2007, and also outlines the ACLU of Northern California's involvement in filing FOIA requests to find out more information about how ICE is conducting this operation. Raids in Marin County, California under "Return To Sender" occurred in early March 2007, showing that the operation continues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marinij.com/marin/ci_5390572&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 2007 ICE arrested 29 individuals in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] as part of Operation Return to Sender and arrested a few days later in nearby [[North Haven, Connecticut|North Haven]]. Some of these individuals had no criminal or immigration history.

{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013}}

In general, the [[European Union law|law of the European Union]] is valid in all of the twenty-eight [[European Union]] [[member state of the European Union|member states]]. However, occasionally member states negotiate certain [[opt-out|opt-outs]] from legislation or treaties of the European Union, meaning they do not have to participate in certain policy areas. Currently, four states have such opt-outs: [[United Kingdom]] (four opt-outs),  [[Denmark]] (three opt-outs), [[Republic of Ireland]] (two opt-outs) and [[Poland]] (one opt-out).

This is distinct from the [[enhanced cooperation]], a measure introduced in the [[Amsterdam Treaty|Treaty of Amsterdam]], whereby a minimum of nine member states are allowed to co-operate within the [[Institutions of the European Union|structure of the European Union]] without involving other member states, after the [[European Commission]] and a [[qualified majority]] have approved the measure. It is further distinct from [[Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification]] and permanent [[Acquis communautaire|acquis]] suspensions, whose lifting is conditional on meeting certain benchmarks by the affected member states.

==Current opt-outs==
{{Politics of the European Union}}

As of 2015, four states have formal opt-outs from a total of five policy areas.

===Schengen Agreement – Ireland and the United Kingdom===
{{See also|Schengen Area#EU member states with opt-outs}}

[[File:Schengen Area participation.svg|thumb|left|{{legend|#0088cc|EU member states participating}} {{legend|#ffff00|EU member states not participating but obliged to join}} {{legend|#ff6666|EU member states with an opt-out}} {{legend|#7CFC00|non-EU member states participating}} {{legend|#FFA500|non-EU member states de facto participating}} {{legend|#4B0082|non-EU member states with an open border}}]]

The [[Schengen Agreement]] abolished border controls between member states. Ireland and the United Kingdom received opt-outs from implementing the [[Schengen acquis|Schengen ''acquis'']] when the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] of 1997 incorporated it into the [[EU treaties]], as they were the only EU member states which had not signed the agreement.  However, the [[:s:Treaty of Amsterdam/Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union|protocol on the Schengen acquis]] specified that they could request to opt into participating in Schengen measures on a case-by-case basis if they wished, subject to unanimous approval of the other participating states.  Ireland only joined the UK in adopting this opt-out to keep their border with [[Northern Ireland]] open via the [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA).&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;{{ cite web | author=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] | title=Volume: 587, Part: 120 (12 Mar 1998: Column 391, Baroness Williams of Crosby) | date=12 March 1998 | work=[[House of Lords]] [[Hansard]] | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980312/text/80312-21.htm | accessdate=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=Publications Office | title=Article 2 | date=10 November 1997 | work=Protocol on the application of certain aspects of Article 7a of the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaty establishing the European Community]] to the United Kingdom and to Ireland, attached to the [[Amsterdam Treaty|Treaty of Amsterdam]] | url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:11997D/AFI/DCL/55:EN:HTML | accessdate=24 October 2007 | authorlink=Publications Office (European Union) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=expand&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/imported/expanding-schengen-outside-the-union/58995.aspx|title=Expanding Schengen outside the Union|date=2008-01-10|accessdate=2014-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Common Travel Area#2011 agreement|renewal of the CTA in 2011]], when the British government was proposing that passports be required for Irish citizens to enter the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | first=Stephen | last=Collins | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2007/1024/1193158824220.html | title=Irish will need passports to visit Britain from 2009 |work=The Irish Times  | date=24 October 2007 | accessdate=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there were calls for Ireland to join the Schengen Area.&lt;ref name=expand/&gt;  However, in response to a question on the issue, [[Bertie Ahern]], the then-incumbent [[Taoiseach]], stated: "On the question of whether this is the end of the common travel area and should we join Schengen, the answer is 'no'."&lt;ref name=expand/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=[[Dáil Éireann]] | title=Vol. 640 No. 2 | date=24 October 2007 | work=Dáil Debate | url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20071024.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=116#N116 | accessdate=25 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opt-out has been criticised in the United Kingdom for hampering the United Kingdom's capabilities in stopping [[transnational crime]] through the inability to access the [[Schengen Information System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] | title=9th Report of 2006/07, HL Paper 49 | date=2 March 2007 | work=[[Schengen Information System II]] (SIS II), [[House of Lords]] [[European Union]] Committee (Sub-Committee F) | url=http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/lords_press_notices/pn020207euf.cfm | accessdate=24 October 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109150418/http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/lords_press_notices/pn020207euf.cfm | archivedate=9 November 2007 | df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The [[:s:Treaty of Amsterdam/Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union|protocol on the Schengen acquis]] and [[:s:Treaty of Amsterdam/Protocol on the position of Denmark|protocol on Denmark]] of the Treaty of Amsterdam stipulate that [[Denmark]], which had been a full party to the Schengen Agreement, would continue to be bound by the provisions and would have the option to participate in future developments of the Schengen acquis, but would do so on an intergovernmental basis rather than under EU law for the provisions which fell under the [[Justice and Home Affairs]] pillar, from which [[#Area of freedom, security and justice – Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom|Denmark obtained an opt-out]]. However, the protocol stipulates that if Denmark chooses not to implement future developments of the Schengen acquis, the EU and its member states "will consider appropriate measures to be taken".&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012E/TXT Article 4(2) in Protocol (No 22) annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]&lt;/ref&gt; In the negotiations for the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark obtained an option to convert its Area of freedom, security and justice (which had incorporated the former Justice and Home Affairs pillar) opt-out into a flexible opt-in modelled on the Irish and British opt-outs. The Protocol stipulates that if Denmark exercises this option, then it will be bound by the Schengen acquis under EU law rather than on an intergovernmental basis. In a [[Danish European Union opt-out referendum, 2015|referendum on 3 December 2015]], 53.1% rejected exercising this option.&lt;ref name=december/&gt;

===Economic and Monetary Union – Denmark and the United Kingdom===
{{main|Denmark and the euro|United Kingdom and the euro}}
{{Euro accession map}}
All member states, other than Denmark and the United Kingdom, have either adopted the euro or are legally bound to do so. During the negotiations of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] of 1992 the UK secured an opt-out,&lt;ref name="UK"/&gt; while a [[:wikisource:Treaty on European Union/Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark|protocol]] gave Denmark the right to decide if and when they would join the euro.  Denmark subsequently notified the Council of the European Communities of their decision to opt out of the euro, and this was included as part of the 1992 [[Edinburgh Agreement (1992)|Edinburgh Agreement]], a [[Decision (European Union)|Decision]] of Council, reached following the Maastricht Treaty's initial rejection in a [[Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum, 1992|1992 Danish referendum]].  The purpose of the agreement was to assist in its approval in a [[Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum, 1993|second referendum]], which it did.

In the UK, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] argued that the UK should join the euro, contingent on approval in a referendum, if [[five economic tests]] were met. However, the assessment of those tests in June 2003 concluded that not all were met.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author=Staff writer | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3307487.stm | title=Euro poll question revealed |publisher=BBC News  | date=11 December 2003 | accessdate=17 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of the 2010s coalition government, [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|elected in 2010]], was against introducing the euro prior to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8676607.stm|title=BBC News - David Cameron and Nick Clegg pledge 'united' coalition|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the Danish electorate voted against joining the euro in a [[Danish euro referendum, 2000|referendum]] by a margin of 53.2% to 46.8% on a turnout of 87.6%.

While the remaining states are all obliged to adopt the euro eventually by the terms of their accession treaties, since membership in the [[Exchange Rate Mechanism]] is a prerequisite for euro adoption, and joining ERM is voluntary, these states can ultimately control the timing of their adoption of the euro by deliberately not satisfying the ERM requirement.

===Defence – Denmark===
[[File:Common Security and Defence Policy participation.svg|thumb|left|{{legend|#0088cc|States which participate in the CSDP}}{{legend|#ff6666|State with an opt-out from the CSDP}}]]

The Edinburgh Agreement of 1992 included a guarantee to Denmark that they would not be obliged to join the [[Western European Union]], which was responsible for defence.  Additionally, the agreement stipulated that Denmark would not take part in discussions or be bound by decisions of the EU with defence implications.  The [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] of 1997 included a [[:wikisource:Treaty of Amsterdam/Protocol on the position of Denmark|protocol]] which formalised this opt-out from the EU's [[Common Security and Defence Policy]] (CSDP). As a consequence, Denmark is excluded from [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]] discussions with defence implications and does not participate in foreign missions with a defence component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU - The Danish Defence Opt-Out|url=http://www.fmn.dk/eng/allabout/Pages/TheDanishDefenceOpt-Out.aspx|publisher=Danish Ministry of Defence|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not a full opt-out, both [[Poland]] and the United Kingdom secured clarifications about how the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], a part of the Treaty of Lisbon, would interact with national law in their countries limiting the extent that European courts would be able to rule on issues related to the Charter if they are brought to courts in Poland or the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=[[European Parliament]] | title=MEP debate forthcoming crucial Lisbon summit and new Treaty of Lisbon | date=10 October 2007 | work=Press Service | url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/expert/infopress_page/008-11448-283-10-41-901-20071008IPR11352-10-10-2007-2007-false/default_en.htm | accessdate=13 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland's then ruling party, [[Law and Justice]], mainly noted concerns that it might force Poland to grant homosexual couples the same kind of benefits which heterosexual couples enjoy,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author=Staff writer | url=http://newsroom.finland.fi/stt/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=16900&amp;group=Politics | title=Finland's Thors blasts Poland over EU rights charter | publisher=NewsRoom Finland | date=5 October 2007 | accessdate=13 October 2007 }}

The UK informed the [[European Council]] of their decision to exercise their opt-out in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/326698/41670_Cm_8897_Accessible.pdf|title=Decision pursuant to Article 10(5) of Protocol 36 to The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|date=July 2014|accessdate=2014-11-20|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the protocol only permitted the UK to either opt-out from all the legislation or none of it, they subsequently opted back into some measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.org.uk/ressource/static/files/sn06268--1-.pdf|title=The UK's 2014 Jurisdiction Decision in EU Police and Criminal Justice Proposals|last=Miller|first=Vaughne|date=20 March 2012|accessdate=2013-02-09|publisher=European Parliament Information Office in the United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Denmark has a more rigid opt-out from the area of freedom, security and justice.  While the Edinburgh Agreement of 1992 stipulated that "Denmark will participate fully in cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X0YlF7X1mlgC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85|title=EU Justice and Home Affairs Law|first=Steve|last=Peers|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Treaty of Amsterdam of 1997 included a [[:wikisource:Treaty of Amsterdam/Protocol on the position of Denmark|protocol]] which exempt it, as a matter of EU law, from participating in these policy areas, which are instead conducted on an intergovernmental basis with Denmark.  The exception is the Schengen visa rules. When a measure is adopted which builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark has six months to decide whether to implement it. If Denmark decides to implement the measure, it takes the force of an international agreement between Denmark and the Schengen states. A failure by Denmark to implement a Schengen measure could result in it being excluded from the Schengen Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Papagianni |first=Georgia |title=Institutional and policy dynamics of EU migration law |year=2006 |publisher=Nijhoff |location=Leiden |isbn=9004152792 |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of other parallel intergovernmental agreements have been concluded between the EU and Denmark to extend to it EU Regulations adopted under the area of freedom, security and justice, which Denmark can't participate in directly due to its opt-out.  These include the [[Brussels Convention]] and [[Dublin Convention]].

In the negotiations of the Lisbon Treaty, Denmark obtained an option to convert its opt-out into a flexible opt-in modelled on the Irish and British opt-outs.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=Europolitics | title=Treaty of Lisbon – Here is what changes! | date=7 November 2007 | work=Europolitics № 3407 | url=http://www.europolitics.info/web/external-file/pdf/gratuit_en/Europolitics_3407_special_treaty.pdf | accessdate=22 November 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127042143/http://www.europolitics.info/web/external-file/pdf/gratuit_en/Europolitics_3407_special_treaty.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Danish European Union opt-out referendum, 2015|referendum on 3 December 2015]], 53.1% rejected exercising of this option.&lt;ref name=december&gt;{{cite web|url=http://um.dk/en/news/newsdisplaypage/?newsID=DCB9FAA3-37A6-4673-989F-0C771B7CFAFE|title=Denmark to vote on Justice and Home Affairs opt-in model on 3 December|date=2015-08-21|accessdate=2015-08-21|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal guarantees==
Several times an EU member state has faced domestic public opposition to the ratification of an EU treaty leading to its rejection in a referendum.  To help address the concerns raised, the EU has offered to make a "legal guarantee" to the rejecting state.  These guarantees did not purport to exempt the state from any treaty provisions, as an opt-out does.  Instead they offered a clarification or interpretation of the provisions to allay fears of alternative interpretations.

===Citizenship – Denmark===
As part of the 1992 Edinburgh Agreement, Denmark obtained a clarification on the nature of [[citizenship of the European Union]] which was proposed in the then yet-to-come-into-force [[Maastricht Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The European Union and the Nordic Countries|first=Lee|last=Miles|publisher=[[Routledge]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8p-HAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agreement was in the form of a Decision of Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:41992X1231:EN:HTML|title=Denmark and the Treaty on European Union|date=1992-12-31|accessdate=2014-06-27|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Communities]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The part of the agreement, which only applied to Denmark, relating to citizenship was as follows:

{{quote|The provisions of Part Two of the Treaty establishing the European Community relating to citizenship of the Union give nationals of the Member States additional rights and protection as specified in that Part. They do not in any way take the place of national citizenship. The question whether an individual possesses the nationality of a Member State will be settled solely by reference to the national law of the Member State concerned.}}

The guarantee to Denmark on citizenship was never incorporated into the treaties, but the substance of this statement was subsequently added to the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] and applies to all member states. This provision stated that:

{{quote|Citizenship of the Union shall complement and not replace national citizenship.}}

=== Irish protocol on the Lisbon Treaty ===
Following the [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008|rejection of the Treaty of Lisbon by the Irish electorate]] in 2008, a number of guarantees (on security and defence, ethical issues and taxation) were given to the Irish in return for holding a second referendum. On the [[Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|second attempt in 2009]] the treaty was approved. Rather than repeat the ratification procedure, the guarantees were merely declarations with a promise to append them to the next treaty.&lt;ref name="EV IR"&gt;Crosbie, Judith (12 May 2009) [http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2009/05/ireland-seeks-sign-off-on-lisbon-treaty-guarantees/64852.aspx Ireland seeks sign-off on Lisbon treaty guarantees], European Voice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IT QUR"&gt;Smyth, Jamie (2 April 2009) [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0402/1224243854498.html MEP queries legal basis for Ireland's Lisbon guarantees], ''The Irish Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

The member states ultimately decided not to sign the protocol alongside the [[Treaty of Accession 2011|Croatian accession treaty]], but rather as a single document. A draft protocol to this effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/summary.do?id=1173982&amp;t=e&amp;l=en|work=[[European Parliament]]|accessdate=3 March 2012|date=6 October 2011|title=2011/0815(NLE) – 06/10/2011 Legislative proposal}}&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by the [[European Council]] and adopted by the [[European Parliament]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2012/0418/breaking41.html|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=18 April 2012|title=Irish Lisbon guarantees approved}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Intergovernmental Conference followed on 16 May,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wms/?id=2012-05-17a.40WS.1|publisher=TheyWorkForYou.com|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=17 May 2012|title=Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Irish Protocol) – Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the protocol was signed by all states of the European Union between that date and 13 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Council of the European Union|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/policies/agreements/search-the-agreements-database?command=details&amp;lang=en&amp;aid=2011053&amp;doclang=EN|title=Protocol on the concerns of the Irish people on the Treaty of Lisbon details|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol was planned to take effect from 1 July 2013, provided that all member states had ratified the agreement by then,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noodls.com/viewNoodl/13598664/fianna-f225il/mep-gallagher-welcomes-ep-support-for-ireland8217s-protoc|publisher=noodls.com|accessdate=7 July 2012|date=21 March 2012|title=MEP Gallagher welcomes EP support for Ireland’s protocol to the Lisbon Treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it only entered into force on 1 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation]] (Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della cooperazione internazionale)|url=http://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/atto/serie_generale/caricaDettaglioAtto/originario?atto.dataPubblicazioneGazzetta=2014-12-17&amp;atto.codiceRedazionale=14A09644&amp;elenco30giorni=false|title=COMUNICATO: Entrata in vigore del Protocollo concernente le preoccupazioni del popolo irlandese al Trattato di Lisbona, fatto a Bruxelles il 13 giugno 2012.

=== Former proposals ===
{{main|United Kingdom renegotiation of European Union membership, 2015–16}}
Following the announcement by the government of the United Kingdom that it would hold a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|referendum]] on [[Brexit|withdrawing from the European Union]], an agreement was reached between it and the EU on renegotiated membership terms should the state vote to remain a member.  In addition to a number of amendments to EU Regulations which would apply to all states, a legal guarantee would be granted to the UK that would explicitly exempt it from the treaty-stated symbolic goal of creating an "ever closer union" by deepening integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/britain-should-stay-in-the-european-union/2016/02/22/a19da056-d995-11e5-925f-1d10062cc82d_story.html|title=Britain should stay in the European Union|date=2016-02-22|accessdate=2016-03-15|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This guarantee was included in a Decision by the [[European Council]], with the promise that it would be incorporated into the treaties during their next revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european-council/2016/02/EUCO-Conclusions_pdf/|title=European Council meeting (18 and 19 February 2016) – Conclusions|date=2016-02-19|accessdate=2016-03-15|publisher=[[European Council]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, following the referendum, in which the UK voted to leave the EU, per the terms of the Decision the provisions lapsed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5354">'''Past Performance''' is a term used in relation to [[government procurement]], horse racing and [[mutual fund]] [[Prospectus (finance)|disclosure]] documents. In general, "past performance" refers to how something has performed in the past. That something could be an athlete, a business, an investment portfolio, an individual stock, a sports team, a race horse, etc.

==Government Procurement==
===United Kingdom===
[[Crown Commercial Service]]'s Procurement Policy Note 04/15, applicable to central government departments, [[Executive agencies|executive agencies]] and [[Non-departmental public body|non-departmental public bodies]], sets out UK government policy effective from 1 April 2015 regarding use of suppliers' past performance information when awarding public contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Crown Commercial Services, Procurement Policy Note 04/15, ''Taking Account of Suppliers' Past Performance'', 25 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Past performance is a central element of the process used by U.S. government agencies when they evaluate companies and proposals to determine which ones will be awarded contracts. Knowledge and awareness of how past performance is evaluated are critical to successful proposals to perform government work.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Hiles, Earl Wells (2015), ''Winning with Past Performance'', {{ISBN|978-1-56726-466-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although past performance is a natural consideration and has been used as an implied evaluation factor, its use was not formalized by the U.S. government until the 1960s through a Department of Defense past performance reporting system known as the Contractor Performance Report.&lt;ref&gt;Described in [[Department of Defense|DoD]] Directive 5126.38, ''Program of Contractor Performance Evaluation'', April 1, 1963, and implemented in Armed Services Procurement Regulation § 1.908 (32 ''CFR'' § 1.908)&lt;/ref&gt;

Defining past performance as an evaluation factor distinguishes it from past performance information, or relevant information about a contractor’s actions under previously awarded contracts. In practice in the U.S. government contracting market, the term “past performance” includes three elements; 1) what work a contractor performed, 2) judgments about the breadth, depth and relevance of that experience and 3) judgments about how well the contractor performed.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon Edwards (1995), ''How to Evaluate Past Performance: A Best Value Approach'', {{ISBN|0-935165-35-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpars.gov/ Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System]&lt;/ref&gt; accessible through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppirs.gov/ Past Performance Information Retrieval System]&lt;/ref&gt; is the U.S. government enterprise solution for collection and retention of contractor past performance information. The main activity associated with this system is the documentation of contractor and grantee performance information that is required by federal regulations (see Federal Acquisition Regulations part 42.15). This is accomplished in web-enabled reports referred to as CPARS reports or report cards. These reports are available to U.S. government agencies making contract award decisions.

==Horse Racing==
[[File:Deauville-Clairefontaine obstacle 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechase]] racing at [[Deauville]]]] 
Past Performances appear on horse racing programs such as the DRF ([[Daily Racing Form]]), [[Equibase]], and [[Brisnet]]. Information on [[jockey]]s, [[horse trainer|trainers]], date of races, finishes in races, speed figures, [[odds]] and more of the last 10 races are provided to give handicappers a sense of history and information to bet with. Horse racing [[handicapping|handicappers]] study the past performance of each horse in a race, examining among other things the combination of speed, endurance and grit demonstrated by the animal in prior meets.&lt;ref&gt;James Quinn (2000), ''The Handicapper's Condition Book, Revised: An Advanced Treatment of Thoroughbred Class'', {{ISBN|0-9648493-4-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual Fund Disclosures==
The phrase “past performance is not an indicator of future performance” (or similar) can be found in the fine print of most [[mutual fund]] literature. Nonetheless, past performance of an investment fund or portfolio, and the management thereof, is frequently considered when judging the fund or the management of it. Demonstrating the ability to outperform peers or index funds repeatedly is seen as a way to evaluate a fund manager’s skill.

The S&amp;P Persistence Scorecard is published twice a year to answer the question of whether past performance in investment funds matters. This report tracks the consistency of top performers over yearly consecutive periods and measures performance persistence through transition matrices. The [[University of Chicago]]’s [[Center for Research in Security Prices]] (CRSP) Survivorship Bias Free Mutual Fund Database serves as the underlying data source for these reports.&lt;ref&gt;[https://us.spindices.com/resource-center/thought-leadership/research/ S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, January 2016, Does Past Performance Matter? The Persistence Scorecard]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{USPL|113|167}}''' (formerly the bill '''{{USBill|113|hr|2600}}'''), a United States public law, that is entitled "to amend the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act to clarify how the Act applies to condominiums," is a bill that was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] during the [[113th United States Congress]].  The [[Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act of 1968]] was passed in 1968 with the intention of helping protect consumers from land-related scams, but regulating the sale of land across state lines.&lt;ref name=gwtol1&gt;{{cite web|title=Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act|url=http://greatwaytolearn.com/realestate/interstate-land-sales-full-disclosure-act/|publisher=greatwaytolearn.com|accessdate=23 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011154322/http://greatwaytolearn.com/realestate/interstate-land-sales-full-disclosure-act/|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The act requires sellers to prepare center information about the piece of property they are trying to sell and disclose it in a "Property Report."  The law was originally administered by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]], but is currently run by the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]].

'''Public policy doctrines for the exclusion of relevant evidence''', in the law of [[evidence]] in the [[United States]], encompass several types of evidence that would be [[Relevance (law)|relevant]] to prove facts at issue in a legal proceeding, but which are nonetheless excluded because of [[public policy]] concerns. There are five major areas of exclusion that arise out of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] ("FRE"): subsequent remedial measures, ownership of liability insurance, offers to plead guilty to a crime, offers to settle a claim, and offers to pay medical expenses.  Many states have modified versions of the FRE under their own state evidence codes which widen or narrow the public policy exclusions in [[State_court_(United_States)|state courts]].

The [[exclusionary rule]], under which evidence gathered by the police from an illegal search is excluded, is of similar operation but is typically considered separately.

==Subsequent remedial measures==
A subsequent remedial measure is an improvement, repair, or safety measure made after an injury has occurred.  FRE [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/ACRule407.htm 407] prohibits the admission of evidence of subsequent remedial measures to show [[defendant]]'s (1) [[negligence]]; (2) culpable conduct; (3) a defect in defendant's product; (4) defect in the design of defendant's product; or (5) the need for a warning or instruction.

Evidence of subsequent remedial measures are generally inadmissible for two reasons. First, [[court]]s do not want to discourage defendants from taking steps that further safety. Second, excluding subsequent remedial measures from evidence avoids having to give juries the difficult task of distinguishing between defendant's due care prior to [[plaintiff]]'s injury, and defendant's due care subsequent to plaintiff's injury.

Subsequent remedial measures are, however, admissible into evidence for 
# [[witness impeachment]] purposes
# proving defendant's ''ownership'' of the instrumentality that injured the plaintiff, ''if'' ownership is disputed 
# proving defendant's ''control'' of the instrumentality that injured the plaintiff, ''if'' control is disputed  
# proving the ''feasibility'' of undertaking precautionary measures, ''if'' feasibility is disputed 

'''Example''':  In a [[slip and fall]] claim where plaintiff falls on the wooden steps leading into a building, defendant decides, as the ambulance is taking plaintiff to the hospital, to quickly sand down the stairs where plaintiff injured herself. FRE [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/ACRule407.htm 407] prohibits plaintiff from introducing evidence of this subsequent remedial measure to prove that the steps were hazardous ''at the time of her injury''.

If defendant says that he did not own the building where the plaintiff fell, and plaintiff disputes this claim, plaintiff may introduce evidence that the defendant sanded the stairs ''to show that defendant did, in fact, own the property on which the steps are located'' at the time her injury occurred. 

If defendant claims that there was nothing he could have done to make the steps safer at the time of plaintiff's slip and fall, and plaintiff disputes this allegation, plaintiff may introduce evidence of the subsequent remedial measure ''to prove that undertaking precautionary measures was, in fact, feasible''.

* '''Note''' that in [[California]], [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1150-1160 1151] designates as inadmissible evidence of subsequent remedial measures only if it is being offered to prove (1) [[negligence]] or (2) culpable conduct; California [[State_court_(United_States)|state courts]], therefore, have abandoned the exclusion of evidence of subsequent remedial measures when being used to prove defects in defendant's product or design of defendant's product, or to prove that there was a need for a warning or instruction.

==Ownership of liability insurance==
Evidence of a party's ownership of—or lack of ownership of—[[liability insurance]] is inadmissible to prove (1) [[negligence]] or (2) wrongful conduct because [[courts]] do not want to discourage parties from carrying such insurance. FRE [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/ACRule411.htm 411] states:

:Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.

The rule spells out four exceptions to the rule of inadmissibility: evidence of a party's ownership of liability insurance—or of a party's failure to own liability insurance—is admissible to prove (1) a [[witness]]' bias or prejudice, i.e. for [[witness impeachment]]; (2) agency; (3) ownership; and (4) control.

#If the owner of the insurance policy disputes ownership or control of the property, for instance, evidence of liability insurance can be introduced to show that it is likely that the owner of the policy probably does own or control the property.
#If a witness has an interest in the policy that gives the witness a motive or bias with respect to specific testimony, the existence of the policy can be introduced to show this motive or bias.  Federal rules of civil procedure rule 26 was amended in 1993 to require that any insurance policy that may pay or may reimburse be made available for photocopying by the opposing litigants, although the policies are not normally information given to the jury.  Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure rule 46 says that an appeal can be dismissed or affirmed if counsel does not update their notice of appearance to acknowledge insurance.  The Cornell University Legal Institute web site includes congressional notes.

Additionally, an exception arises where the party's mention of its own liability insurance is inextricably intertwined with another statement that is admissible. For example, if after an automobile accident, the driver of one car runs over to the other and says "don't worry, my insurance will pay to fix the damage I caused to your car", the entire statement is admissible not to show that the driver is insured, but that the driver has admitted ''fault''.

* '''Note''' that in [[California]], [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1150-1160 1155] provides that evidence of a party's whole or part ''ownership'' of liability insurance is inadmissible to prove (1) negligence or (2) other wrongdoing.  The statute does not include ''total lack of ownership'' of liability insurance, which may thus be used to prove that defendant did not exercise due care.

==Offers to plead guilty to a crime==
FRE [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/ACRule410.htm 410] holds that (1) withdrawn [[Plea|guilty pleas]]; (2) ''[[nolo contendere]]'' pleas; (3) statements made during proceedings regarding guilty pleas; (4) statements made during proceedings regarding nolo contendere pleas; (5) and statements made during plea discussions with an attorney present are inadmissible for public policy reasons even if they are [[Relevance (law)|relevant]]. The motivation behind excluding such pleas from evidence is to encourage [[plea bargain]]ing.

Two FRE-contained exceptions apply to this rule: criminal pleas, plea discussions, and related statements are admissible (i) in '''''any'' proceeding''' where another statement made in the course of the same plea or plea discussion has been introduced and the statement ought in '''fairness''' be considered contemporaneously with it, or (ii) in a '''criminal proceeding for perjury''' or false statement if the statement was made by the defendant under oath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel.

Additionally, a criminal defendant may waive inadmissibility protections, rendering criminal pleas, plea discussions, and related statements admissible at trial.  It is a common practice for [[prosecutor]]s drawing up plea deals to include terms requiring the defendant to agree that statements made in the course of plea negotiations may be used to impeach the testimony of that defendant, to protect against the possibility of the defendant later changing her story.

* '''Note''' that if a defendant chooses ''not'' to withdraw her guilty plea, this is an [[Party admission|admission by a party opponent]] and may be admitted into evidence in subsequent ''civil'' proceedings.

==Offers to settle a claim==
Offers to settle a claim, and related statements made during a [[settlement conference]], are generally inadmissible under FRE [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/ACRule408.htm 408]. The primary public policy motivation is to encourage litigants to settle their disputes. This rule also recognizes that parties may make settlement offers even where they believe they have no actual liability, in order to avoid the expense of litigation. A 2006 amendment to the rule permits the admission of statements made during settlement discussions between a private party and a regulatory body, when those statements are offered as evidence in a ''criminal'' case, subject to FRE [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403 403].  

The inadmissibility of settlement claims only prohibits the admission of statements, not the admission of facts. Thus, if a party to a settlement conference mentions that she possesses a certain document relevant to the proceedings, the other party may seek to [[Discovery (law)|discover]] that document through legal processes, despite it having first been mentioned in the settlement conference; merely disclosing a document's existence and mentioning it during a settlement conference does not insulate it from being discovered and admitted.

Additionally, the public policy exception of excluding relevant evidence arising out of an offer to settle cannot not apply if the evidence sought to be introduced is a claim made in a period ''before'' a dispute between the parties arose.  
:'''Example''': Florida-based piano teacher P gets her expensive, snow white tile floors polished by North Carolina-based cleaning company C on March 22.  C mails P a bill for $'''100''',000 on March 29.  P thought that the service would only cost $75,000.00, and disputes the $100,000 charge.  Unable to come to a compromise with P, C  brings suit on May 8 in [[United_States_federal_courts|federal court]] to collect $'''200''',000. FRE 403 does not prohibit P's introduction of the $100,000 March bill into evidence as an admission by C that the total amount disputed cannot exceed $'''100''',000.

==Offers to pay medical expenses==
An offer to pay medical expenses is an offer of this nature made by a party who might potentially be liable for an injury to another is inadmissible despite its [[Relevancy|relevance]]. FRE [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/ACRule409.htm 409] states:

:Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to pay medical, hospital, or similar expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible to prove liability for the injury.

Evidence of an offer to pay medical expenses is inadmissible for the [[public policy]] rationale that [[court]]s do not want to discourage parties responsible for injuring others from paying for the treatment of those injuries.

Statements made in connection with offers to pay medical expenses, however, are not excluded by FRE 409.
:'''Example''': Plaintiff P slices her lip on a shard of glass that somehow made its way into a salad prepared in defendant D's restaurant. D later visits P in the hospital, puts a bouquet of sunflowers on the table next to the bed where P is sobbing in pain, and exclaims,"I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault!  Please don't worry about your expenses for this hospital visit, I'll write you a check for whatever your bills add up to." In a subsequent [[personal injury]] suit brought by P against D in [[United_States_federal_courts|federal court]], P may introduce D's statement "I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault!" as an admission of fault by D.

* '''Note''' that in [[California]], [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1150-1160 1152(a)] renders '''''both''''' offers to pay medical expenses ''as well as'' "statements made in negotiation thereof" inadmissible to prove liability.  In the above example, therefore, a CA court would prohibit P's introduction of not only the "Please don't worry about your expenses for this hospital visit, I'll write you a check for whatever your bills add up to" statement, '''''but also''''' the "I'm so sorry about your injury, it was completely my fault" statement.

==Mediation proceedings: a California-specific rule==
[[California]] law excludes from evidence and [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] [[Relevance|relevant]] statements made "for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation or a
mediation consultation" through [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §§[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=evid&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1115-1128 1115-1125], for the public policy purpose of encouraging the resolution of legal conflicts by mediation.

==Exclusionary rule==
The [[exclusionary rule]] is another rule under which relevant evidence may be excluded, based in part on public policy concerns. It causes evidence gathered by the police from an illegal search to be inadmissible in a criminal case. The exclusion is intended, in part, to discourage law enforcement officials from violating the search subject's constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure. However, it is premised as much on the right of the individual accused against such a search as it is on the larger issue of law enforcement behavior. The rule does also reflect on questions of reliability regarding some (but not all) types of evidence that are excluded thereunder. For example, an officer conducting a warrantless search may have more of an opportunity to plant evidence, and a confession coerced out of a party denied access to legal counsel may be false.

In legal education and discourse, the exclusionary rule is generally treated as a rule of [[criminal procedure]], rather than a rule of evidence.

'''Riddell v Porteous''' [1999] 1 NZLR 1 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability in tort for defective products.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Bagleys hired Riddell on a "labour only" basis to build their house in [[Mosgiel]] based on plans drawn up by Bagley's [[architect]]. After the house was completed, it was discovered that Riddell had departed from the approved plans as far as the deck was concerned, resulting in rainwater seeping into their house.

This departure from the plans escaped the councils building inspector.

However, before this defect came to their notice, the Bagleys had sold their house to Porteous, who soon discovered the defect.

Porteous subsequently sued Riddell, the Dunedin City Council, and the Bagleys as well, and was originally awarded $21,200 in damages by the District Court.

On appeal, the High Court set aside this award.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal reinstated the District Court's original judgement.

According to its founder, [[Nitsana Darshan-Leitner]], its creation was inspired by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] in the [[United States]], which used [[civil litigation]] to cripple and bankrupt the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and [[neo-Nazi]] groups in the US.&lt;ref name=Phillips-Melanie&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.melaniephillips.com/articles-new/?p=574| title=Conservative Using law to fight a war | publisher=[[Jewish Chronicle]] |date=March 21, 2008 | first=Melanie | last=Phillips | accessdate = 2008-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a leaked US embassy cable, Darshan-Leitner told a US embassy official in 2007 that her organisation in its early years "took direction ... on which cases to pursue" and still "receives evidence" from the [[Mossad]], the national intelligence agency of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel arrests Palestinian teenager over Facebook posts|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/israel-arrests-palestinian-teenager-facebook-posts-151105070221213.html|accessdate=27 February 2018|work=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darshan-Leitner denies ever saying that to a U.S. diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Alex|title=Critics Fear Crackdown on Palestinian Free Speech as Israel Takes Aim at Facebook|url=https://theintercept.com/2016/07/28/critics-fear-crackdown-on-palestinian-free-speech-as-israel-takes-aim-at-facebook/|accessdate=27 February 2018|work=The Intercept|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Shurat HaDin is staffed with activist [[Israelis|Israeli]] attorneys and works with numerous other law offices internationally which serve as co-counsel on cases being litigated in courtrooms in the [[U.S]], [[Canada]], [[Israel]] and elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

By 2012, Shurat HaDin had 11 employees, three with salaries over $100,000.&lt;ref name=NYT2015&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/world/middleeast/crusading-for-israel-in-a-way-some-say-is-misguided.html Crusading for Israel in a Way Some Say Is Misguided], Jodi Rudoren, Jan. 23, 2015, [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; It retains  two public relations firms, one in Israel and one in New York.&lt;ref name=NYT2015/&gt;

===North Korea abduction case ===
Plaintiffs proved claims under the terrorism exception to the [[Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act]] leading to a $330,000,000 judgement against [[North Korea]]. This was the first time that a US court concluded that a foreign regime which abducts an individual who is then never heard from again, has the burden of proving that he has not been murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_09-cv-00648/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_09-cv-00648-0.pdf |title=HAN KIM v.

===''Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organization'', 04-cv-00397===
{{main|Sokolow et al v. Palestine Liberation Organization et al}}
On February 24, 2015 a [[New York City|New York]] District Court jury found the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) and [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] (PA) liable for six terror attacks under the US [[Anti-Terrorism Act 2005|Anti-Terrorism Act]]. The jury was unanimous in its decision regarding six terror attacks in Jerusalem that killed and wounded US citizens. The jury awarded the plaintiffs $218,500,000, which was trebled under the Anti-Terrorism Act to $655,500,000. The plaintiff's argued the defendants provided weapons, bombs, logistics, safe houses and money for these attacks, and provided payments to those responsible for the attacks while they were in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/id=1202718658496/Jury-Finds-PLO-Authority-Liable-for-Terror-Acts |title=Jury Finds PLO, Authority Liable for Terror Acts |publisher=New York Law Journal |date=2015-02-24 |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, 2016, the verdict was overturned in the appeal court, as "the federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process clause of the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/nyregion/appeals-court-terror-verdict-plo-palestinian-authority.html?_r=0 Court Throws Out $655.5 Million Terrorism Verdict Against Palestinian Groups], B.

===Gaza flotilla ===
Shurat Hadin used [[lawfare]] to threaten lawsuits against parties associated with the [[Gaza Freedom Flotilla|Gaza Flotilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/06/george-jonas-using-lawfare-to-anchor-the-gaza-flotilla/ |title=George Jonas: Using lawfare to anchor the Gaza flotilla |publisher=National Post |date=July 2011 |accessdate=2015-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711232556/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/07/06/george-jonas-using-lawfare-to-anchor-the-gaza-flotilla/ |archivedate=2012-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was accomplished in three ways: 1) It informed maritime insurance companies that by insuring sea vessels used by terrorists (for delivery of weapons to be used by terrorists), they would be liable for future attacks by those terrorists; 2) It warned [[Inmarsat]], a U.S. based satellite communications provider, that under U.S. law it would be open to charges of aiding and abetting terrorism if it provide services to those Gaza-bound ships; and 3) it filed civil lawsuits against the ships that were to participate in the flotilla.&lt;ref&gt;The second action was Shurat HaDin’s legal warning to Inmarsat, a U.S. based satellite communications provider, that under U.S. law they will be open to charges of aiding and abetting terrorism if they provide services to these Gaza-bound ships.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgement against Iran and Syria===
Nitsana Darshan-Leitner of the Shurat HaDin Israel won a case in May 2012 in which she was representing the family of [[Murder of Daniel Wultz|Daniel Wultz]], a 16-year-old American who was killed in a [[suicide bomber]] [[2006 Tel Aviv shawarma restaurant bombing|attack in a Tel Aviv restaurant]] in 2006. The case was tried in a U.S. [[United States district court|District Court]], and represented the first time that a U.S. court issued a judgement against Syria for terror related activities. The amount of the judgement was $323,000,000. The court explained that Iran and Syria were responsible for supporting "Palestinian militants" in that bombing which killed 11 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AP|first=|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/israeli-group-wins-323-million-terror-suit-syria-iran-article-1.1078838|title=Israeli group wins $323 million terror suit against Syria, Iran|publisher=nydailynews.com|date=May 15, 2012|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deitch|first=Ian|url=https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-group-wins-terror-suit-against-syria-iran-184948425.html|title=Israeli group wins terror suit against Syria, Iran|publisher=news.yahoo.com|date=May 15, 2012|accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120915084604/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israeli-group-wins-323-million-suit-in-us-court-against-iran-and-syria-for-restaurant-bombing/2012/05/15/gIQAl5UkRU_story.html Israeli group wins $323 million suit in US court against Iran and Syria for restaurant bombing]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sderot===
On January 7, 2008, ten families of [[Sderot]] (Israel) residents, whose relatives were killed or seriously injured by [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] [[Qassam rocket]]s, filed a lawsuit against the [[Egyptian government]] in the [[District Court#Israel|Be'er Sheva District Court]] seeking compensation in the amount of NIS 260,000,000 ($65,000,000 US).  The court complaint accuses Egypt of intentionally assisting what it calls [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terror organizations]] in smuggling explosives and weapons into the [[Hamas]] controlled [[Gaza strip]].

The plaintiffs argue that Cairo assists the organizations by authorizing the smuggling of tons of explosives and thousands of weapons into Gaza. They also argued that the Egyptian government allowed what the group called terrorists to cross back and forth from the Egyptian-held [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] into Gaza, permitting them an open route to and from what Shurat HaDin asserted to be terrorist training bases in states
like [[Iran]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]].

===Alien Torts Act and the Torture Victims Protection Act===
On September 10, 2006, Shurat HaDin and [[New York City|New York]] attorney Robert Tolchin filed a lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the families of 12 missing [[Iranian Jews]] against the former Iranian President [[Mohammad Khatami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suissa |first=David |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/david_suissa/article/rebels_with_a_cause_20120208/ |title=Opinion: Rebels with a cause |publisher=Jewishjournal.com |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint alleges that the former president was responsible for the kidnapping and torture of their missing family members in Iran.  The families, currently residing in Los Angeles and Israel, claim that  Khatami  instituted the cruel policy of  making Iranian Jewish detainees "disappear"&amp;nbsp;– that is imprisoning Iranian Jews without trials and refusing to provide their families any information concerning their arrests, status or whereabouts.

The families of the missing Jews, who are not U.S. citizens, brought the suit under special laws&amp;nbsp;– the [[Alien Tort Statute]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991]]&amp;nbsp;– which permit foreigners to sue their tormentors for torture and kidnapping in American courts.  The plaintiffs are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages against Khatami for what they assert to be his role in the ongoing disappearance of their relatives.  Khatami has refused to answer the complaint and has defaulted the case.

===Collaborators with Israel===
On May 1, 2008, Shurat HaDin along with former Soviet [[refusenik]], [[Ida Nudel]] launched a public campaign to save the life of a Palestinian police officer accused of having assisted the Israeli intelligence services in hunting down fugitive terrorists. The policeman, Imad Sa'ad,&lt;ref name="Eli Lake"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/appeal-is-made-to-bush-to-save-arab-accused/75781/| title=Appeal Is Made to Bush To Save Arab Accused of Helping Israel| publisher=[[The New York Sun]] |date=May 5, 2008| first=Eli| last=Lake | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been sentenced to death by a Palestinian [[military tribunal]] in Hebron. Sa'ad, it is alleged, provided the [[Israel Defense Forces]] with the whereabouts of four suspected bomb makers whom the [[Palestinian Authority]] was unwilling to hand over to the Israelis.

Shurat HaDin accused the Palestinians of having engaged in a [[show trial]] that did not permit the defendant, a father of four, the [[right to counsel]] nor the right to call [[witness]]es in his defense. Darshan-Leitner and Nudel wrote to then-president [[George W. Bush]], the [[European Union]] and the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to ask for their support.&lt;ref name="Jeff Jacoby"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/05/07/who_will_save_imad_saad | title=Who will save Imad Saad| publisher=Boston Globe|date=May 7, 2008| first=Jeff| last=Jacoby | accessdate = 2008-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UBS bank===
On May 13, 2008, Shurat HaDin  was co-counsel in filing in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] against the Swiss bank, [[UBS]]&lt;ref name="FoxNews 2"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008May13/0,4670,TerrorLawsuit,00.html | title=Swiss mega bank UBS GA Accused of Financing Terror | publisher=[[FoxNews]]|date=May 13, 2008| first=Fox| last=News | accessdate = 2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is accused by the plaintiffs of financing terror.

The plaintiffs in the case, all of whom had family members injured or killed in Israel, allege that [[UBS]]'s unlawful eight-year-long provision of financial services to the Islamic Republic of Iran at the time that the group allege that Tehran was [[providing material support to terrorist organizations]] renders the Swiss bank liable for the harm that has been inflicted upon them and their families. This was the first civil action brought by what the group allege to be American victims of [[Katyusha rocket]] attacks by [[Hezbollah]].

The group alleges that the Swiss bank was involved in transferring dollars to regimes such as Iran, [[Cuba]], and [[North Korea]]. The UBS operation was uncovered by American soldiers in Iraq in 2003 who discovered brand new dollars, still wrapped in [[Federal Reserve]] casings behind a wall in [[Saddam Hussein]]'s palace.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|author=Finance |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2935936/UBS-help-for-Iran-broke-US-sanctions.html |title=UBS help for Iran 'broke US sanctions' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Federal Reserve investigation of the currency determined that UBS was responsible for illegally transferring between $4 to $5 billion to [[State Sponsors of Terrorism|states designated by the U.S. as sponsors of terrorism]] between 1996 and 2004.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; At first UBS sought to deny the extent of the money transfers it had provided to Iran and others, but eventually was compelled to admit the scope of its criminal activities.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; UBS, one of world's wealthiest banks, was fined $100 millions by the Federal Reserve for its conduct.&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt; The lawsuit charges UBS, which has a branch in New York, with aiding and abetting what the group allege to be Iran's support of terrorism, by illegally providing Tehran the dollars it needed to pass along to the terrorist groups for their purchases and attacks.

===Iranian families and diplomats===
On June 30, 2008, Shurat HaDin filed a petition in the [[Israeli High Court]] of Justice on behalf of the families of 12 missing [[Iranian Jews]] seeking to block the Israeli government from releasing information on the fate of [[Iranian diplomats kidnapping (1982)|four disappeared Iranian diplomats]] as part of a [[Israeli prisoner exchanges|prisoner exchange]] deal with Hezbollah. The petition was heard on Wednesday, July 2, 2008. The Jews were arrested in the 1990s as they sought to escape from Iran across the border with Pakistan and they are believed to still be in Iranian prisons. The Iranian diplomats disappeared in [[South Lebanon]] in 1982.
The petition demands that the Prime Minister not authorize the transfer of information regarding the diplomats until such time as reliable and detailed information is received about the missing Jews' fate.

Shurat Hadin claims it has reliable information that at least one of the Jews is still alive and being held as a  prisoner in Tehran. The families contend that the government must honor the obligations imposed upon it by the Israeli High Court approximately two years ago, in a prior High Court proceeding, that [the Israeli government] "...push forward diligently without sparing any effort in order to gain information about the [12 missing] Jews of Iran." The families are insisting that there be a "[[quid pro quo]]" on information about their family members in exchange for the release of the details on the fate of the missing Iranians.

Shurat HaDin emphasized that, the families' are not appealing against the deal to bring back the Hizbollah captives itself but rather are demanding that the fate of the 12 missing Jews be included as a "quid pro quo" before any information about the diplomats is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=105878 |title=Soldiers set to be returned to Israel in 10 days |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Express Bank and Lebanese-Canadian Bank===
On July 14, 2008, Shurat HaDin and Attorney Robert Tolchin of New York filed suit against [[American Express]] Bank (Amex), accusing it of partaking in a transfer of money to [[Hizbollah]]. The action was filed in the [[New York Supreme Court|New York State Supreme Court]] in Manhattan.

Representing some 85 victims and their family members, the Shurat HaDin lawsuit&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-07-14-554183465_x.htm| title=Hezbollah attack victims' relatives sue 2 banks| publisher=[[USA Today]] | accessdate = 31 Dec 2011 | first=Samuel | last=Maull | date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleges that the Amex and the [[Lebanese Canadian Bank]] (LCB) unlawfully performed millions of dollars in wire transfers for Hizbollah between 2004 and 2006. The plaintiffs assert that Hizbollah used the funds transferred by Amex Bank and LCB to prepare and carry out the rocket attacks which the terrorist organization rained on Israeli cities between July 12 and August 14, 2006.

The plaintiffs rested their claims in part on written findings issued by the [[New York State Banking Department]] in 2007, which determined that Amex Bank had failed to establish adequate procedures to prevent [[terrorism financing]] as demanded by state and federal law. This was the first lawsuit brought by alleged victims of terrorism against a U.S. financial institution. The suite was dismissed by the federal trial judge in 2010 but reinstated on appeal in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Court: Bank account puts terror case in NY|url = http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/court-bank-account-puts-terror-case-ny|website = CNS News|accessdate = 2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jimmy Carter===
On February 1, 2011, Shurat HaDin and US attorney David Schoen, Esq. of [[Montgomery, Alabama]] filed a federal suit against former president [[Jimmy Carter]] and publisher [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] over the publication of Carter’s book, ''[[Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid]]''.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/class-action-suit-filed-against-jimmy-carter-book/| title=Class Action Suit Filed Against Jimmy Carter Book| publisher=New York Times | accessdate = 25 Jan 2013 | first=Jimmy| last=Carter | date=Feb 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Center's information page, the book violated New York's consumer protection law.  &lt;blockquote&gt;

The plaintiffs, who hope to have the case certified as a [[class action]], are members of the reading public who purchased Carter’s book expecting that they were buying an accurate and factual record of historic events concerning Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. The lawsuit contends that Carter, who holds himself out as a Middle-East expert, and his publisher, intentionally presented untrue and inaccurate information and sought to capitalize on the author’s status as a former [[Presidents of the United States|President of the United States]] to mislead unsuspecting members of the public.  The complaint alleges that the defendants’ misrepresentations, all highly critical of Israel, violate New York consumer protection laws, specifically New York General Business Law § 349, which makes it unlawful to engage in deceptive acts in the course of conducting business. While acknowledging Carter’s right to publish his personal views, the plaintiffs assert that the defendants violated the law and, thus, harmed those who purchased the book.&lt;ref name="ILC-Carter"&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.israellawcenter.org/page.asp?id=339&amp;show=photo&amp;pn=1118&amp;ref=report | title=Class Action Suit Filed Against Jimmy Carter for Deliberate Misrepresentations in Anti-Israel Book | publisher=Shurat HaDin | accessdate = 25 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Simon &amp; Schuster said the suit was frivolous, without merit, and a “chilling attack on free speech.”  The plaintiffs withdrew the suit on May 3, 2011 (three months later) with no money changing hands. At the time, Shoen told ''The New York Times'' that the original suit had "technical jurisdictional concerns" and would be filed again in New York state court.&lt;ref name="ILC-Carter-dropped"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/plaintiffs-drop-suit-over-jimmy-carter-book/| title=Plaintiffs Drop Suit Over Jimmy Carter Book| publisher=New York Times | accessdate = 25 Jan 2013 | first=Jimmy| last=Carter | date=May 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Vision Australia===
In February 2012, Shurat HaDin accused [[World Vision Australia]] (a [[Christian]] relief, development, and advocacy organisation) of providing "financial aid to a [[Gaza City|Gaza]]-based terrorist group", the [[Union of Agricultural Work Committees]] (UAWC), which they also alleged is a "front for terror group the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]]" (PFLP).  World Vision "suspended its dealings" with UAWC until the outcome of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paraszczuk |first=Joanna |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?ID=258227&amp;R=R1 |title=Australian groups accused of aiding PFLP-linked group |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/world-vision-to-investigate-terror-link/story-e6frg6nf-1226274230633 |title=World Vision to investigate terror link |publisher=Theaustralian.com.au |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; WV resumed working with UAWC after [[AUSAID]] and World Vision determined that the allegations were unfounded. A spokesperson said "UAWC is a nonprofit company that is registered with the Israeli Justice Ministry".&lt;ref name=jp262581/&gt; According to [[The Australian]] newspaper, 'AusAID has written to Shurat HaDin to confirm that a detailed investigation has been conducted into the claims and no evidence has been found to substantiate them'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/foreign-affairs/vision-back-as-ausaid-dismisses-terror-link/story-fn59nm2j-1226286658838 | title=Vision back as AusAID dismisses 'terror' link | date=March 2, 2012 | work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Shurat HaDin provided what it described as "conclusive evidence" that Gaza-based UAWC was linked to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.&lt;ref name=jp262581&gt;{{cite web|last=Paraszczuk |first=Joanna |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=262581 |title='Aussie nonprofit funding PFLP-linked Ga... JPost - National News |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2012, the Australian Foreign Minister [[Bob Carr]] issued a statement that "An AusAID examination has concluded there is no evidence to support claims by the Israel Law Center (Shurat HaDin) that funding through World Vision Australia to a Palestinian [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]], the Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC) was in violation of section 21 of the Charter of the United Nations Act, 1945.".  He added, "I understand the material provided by the Israel Law Center has been carefully examined by AusAID in consultation with other agencies including the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foreignminister.gov.au/releases/2012/bc_mr_120531.html | title=Union of Agricultural Work Committees | date=May 31, 2012 | work=DFAT Media Release}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2012, World Vision issued a detailed, 5-page letter to Shurat ha-Din in which it stated that the claims were "unsubstantiated, and in some circumstances, defamatory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.jwire.com.au/news/world-vision-answers-shurat-hadin | title=World Vision answers Shurat HaDin | date=October 6, 2012 | work=Jwire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney, Australia ===
In 2012, Prof. Dan Avnon, a political theorist at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]], applied for fellowship at [[Sydney University]] and asked Prof. Jake Lynch at Sydney to endorse his application. Lynch refused, citing his leadership with the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies and his support for the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] (BDS) campaign. In 2013, Shurat HaDin sued Lynch for violating Australia's anti-racism laws and attempted to use the suit to outlaw BDS in Australia. The [[Executive Council of Australian Jewry]] publicly denounced the suit as an inappropriate use of the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = BDS case splits Australia's pro-Israel lobby - Jewish World News|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.597200|accessdate = 2015-06-18|first = Dan|last = Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Landmark case puts 'anti-Semitic' BDS on trial in Australia - Diplomacy and Defense|url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.555797|accessdate = 2015-06-18|first = Dan|last = Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the court struck part of the suit, and Shurat HaDin lawyers narrowed the complaint to the specifics of Avnon and Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Australian court case fires up BDS campaign against Israel - Jewish World News|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.588059|accessdate = 2015-06-18|first = Dan|last = Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Avnon made known that he did not support the suit. In July 2014, noting that Shurat HaDin did not represent a willing client and did not have a complaint of its own, the court dismissed the case and awarded attorney fees to Lynch.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Australian court drops racism case against professor who backs BDS  - Jewish World|url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/.premium-1.605672|accessdate = 2015-06-18|first = Dan|last = Goldberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shurat HaDin told [[Haaretz]] that "the case was thrown out on a [[technicality]], not on the merits of the arguments ... [Lynch's] lawyers came up with a trick to avoid the issue being heard on its merits."  The Shurat HaDin spokesman said the suit was a warning to other Australian academic institutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Case against Palestinian Authority===
Shurat HaDin is preparing to take the [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) to the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). In the event that the Palestinian Authority is accepted into the ICC, it will enable the PA to become susceptible to lawsuits. Shurat HaDin is preparing in advance by collecting thousands of testimonies from Israeli victims of Palestinian terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=icc&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4367659,00.html NGO to sue PA for terrorism]&lt;/ref&gt; Shurat HaDin Chairwoman Nitsana Darshan-Leitner explained, "we've received dozens of terror victims' testimonies, from relatively 'light' stories to truly shocking ones."&lt;ref name=icc/&gt;  Shurat HaDin filed a complaint against Mahmoud Abbas before filing complaints against other PLO officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israellawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ICC-Complaint-Mahmoud-Abbas.pdf |format=PDF |title=In the International Criminal Court : Shurat Ha-Din Israel Law Center v Mahmoud Abbas |website=Israellawcenter.org |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2015, days after PA appealed to join the ICC, Shurat HaDin filed complaint against three PLO officials, Jibril Rajoub,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israellawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ICC-communication-Rajoub.pdf |format=PDF |title=In the International Criminal Court : Shurat Ha-Din Israel Law Center v Jibril Rajoub |website=Israellawcenter.org |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Majid Faraj&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israellawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ICC-Communication-Faraj.pdf |format=PDF |title=In the International Criminal Court : Shurat Ha-Din Israel Law Center v Majid Faraj |website=Israellawcenter.org |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prime minister Rami Hamdallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israellawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ICC-Communication-Rami-Hamdallah.pdf |format=PDF |title=In the International Criminal Court : Shurat Ha-Din Israel Law Center v Rami Hamdallah |website=Israellawcenter.org |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israeli group files war crimes suit against Palestinian officials|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=22623|publisher=[[Israel Hayom]]|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A complaint was also filed against Hamas leader Khaled Mashal &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israellawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ICC-Khaled-Mashal.pdf |format=PDF |title=In the International Criminal Court : Shurat Ha-Din Israel Law Center v Khaled Mashal |website=Israellawcenter.org |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015 Facebook lawsuit===
On 8 December 2015, Shurat HaDin posted two racist Facebook pages, one anti-Israel and the other anti-Palestinian Arab in an effort to establish bias at Facebook; Facebook at first removed only the anti-Arab hate page, while maintaining that the overtly anti-Semitic anti-Israel page "met community standards," but later conceded that the pages were alike and also removed the anti-Israel hate page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://observer.com/2016/01/facebook-caves-on-israel-hate-page/|title=Facebook Caves on Israel Hate Page|date=2016-01-07|website=Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lawsuit, ''Lakin v.

===2018 Lorde concert cancellation===
On 31 January 2018, Shurat HaDin filed a lawsuit claiming $13,000 in damages to "emotional" and "artistic welfare" on behalf of three teenage Israelis against the New Zealand Palestinian solidarity activists Justine Sachs and Nadia Abu-Shanab for allegedly convincing the New Zealand singer [[Lorde]] to cancel her scheduled tour of Tel Aviv in mid-2018. The lawsuit was filed under the 2011 [[Law for  Prevention of Damage to State of Israel through Boycott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israelis sue New Zealanders over Lorde boycott|url=https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5078695,00.html|accessdate=31 January 2018|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Jack|title=Israel Boycott Activists Sued Over Lorde Tel Aviv Concert Cancellation|url=http://www.newsweek.com/lorde-boycotted-israel-now-two-new-zealanders-face-lawsuit-persuading-her-nix-795821|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost-10-2018 /&gt; Sachs and Abu-Shanab had earlier penned an open letter on the New Zealand online current affairs magazine [[The Spinoff]] in December 2017 urging Lorde to cancel her Israel concert, citing human rights abuses against the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abu-Shanab|first1=Nadia|last2=Sachs|first2=Justine|title=Dear Lorde, here’s why we’re urging you not to play Israel|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/21-12-2017/dear-lorde-heres-why-were-urging-you-not-to-play-israel/|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=[[The Spinoff]]|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered that the two New Zealand activists pay NIS 45,000 ($12,300) in damages to the plaintiffs, and court fees. This is believed to be the first successful application of the 2011 law.&lt;ref name=jpost-10-2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shapiro |first1=Amy |title=NEW ZEALAND BDS ACTIVISTS ORDERED TO PAY DAMAGES OVER LORDE ISRAEL BOYCOTT |url=https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/New-Zealand-BDS-activists-ordered-to-pay-damages-over-Lorde-Israel-boycott-569194 |accessdate=11 October 2018 |publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' |date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli courts fines two Kiwi activists $23,000 over Lorde boycott letter |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/israeli-court-fines-two-kiwi-activists-23-600-over-lorde-boycott-letter |accessdate=11 October 2018 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli court: NZ activists must pay for Lorde cancellation |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=12141158 |accessdate=11 October 2018 |publisher=''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' |date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israeli court says New Zealand activists must pay for Lorde cancellation |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-court-says-new-zealand-activists-must-pay-for-lorde-cancellation/ |accessdate=11 October 2018 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=''[[The Times of Israel]]'' |date=11 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/12/israel-fines-new-zealand-teenagers-18000-for-urging-lorde-concert-boycott&lt;/ref&gt;

The two activists stated that they had "no intention" of paying the teenagers, and launched a crowdfunding campaign in order to give the money to ''Gaza Mental Health Foundation'', and raised more than $18,000  for the Gaza project in 3 days.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/15/lorde-concert-boycott-new-zealanders-fined-by-israel-raise-thousands-for-gaza Lorde concert boycott: New Zealanders fined by Israel raise thousands for Gaza], Eleanor Ainge Roy, 15 Oct 2018, [[The Guardian]]&lt;/ref&gt; Darshan-Leitner said that legal agreements between Israel and New Zealand would enable here to "enforce this ruling in New Zealand, and go after [the activists'] bank accounts until it has been fully realized."&lt;ref name=jpost-10-2018 /&gt; Academic legal experts in New Zealand wrote that attempts to enforce the judgement there were unlikely to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = NZ activist being sued in Israel calls it 'publicity stunt' | work = Radio New Zealand | date = 13 October 2018 | quote = [[Waikato University]] law professor Alexander Gillespie said "In theory they can apply to the courts here to enforce their judgement, but it's very unlikely that the judgement will be enforced because it's completely contrary to our own laws."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Maria Hook, School of Law, [[University of Otago]] | title = Israeli judgment against New Zealand activists for Lorde’s “boycott” of Israel | url = https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/conflicts/author/hooma65p/ | quote = [The] rules require Shurat HaDin to bring separate proceedings against the activists in New Zealand seeking enforcement of the Israeli judgment.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Harpoon===
According to the Shurat HaDin's director [[Nitsana Darshan-Leitner]], the NGO was in regular contact with the [[Mossad]] as part of the latter's ''Operation Harpoon'' to track terrorist money networks. Darshan-Leitner held regular briefings with Mossad operatives who would tip her off on suspect financing worthwhile pursuing in court discovery hearings. In some cases, the Israeli government provided written affidavits to back up some claims. Darshan-Leitner's role in the operation was voluntary and unpaid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Operation-Harpoon-How-the-Mossad-and-an-Israeli-NGO-destroyed-terrorist-money-networks-513622 OP.

== Award ==
In 2012, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, Director of Shurat HaDin, received the Moskowitz Prize for Zionism for fighting Israel's war on terror in courtrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shurat HaDin head to receive Zionism prize|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Shurat-HaDin-head-to-receive-Zionism-prize|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Philip Giraldi]] wrote that Shurat haDin abuses [[lawfare]] litigation in U.S. courts, and that "Many of the charges are [[Frivolous litigation|frivolous]] and only intended to advance foreign political interests through exploitation of the U.S. judiciary system. The suits frequently accomplish little beyond tying up American courtrooms. Those who are sued have to waste time and resources defending themselves, which is precisely what is intended ...  Despite describing itself as an NGO, the organization [Shurat haDin] works closely with the Israeli government, and received marching orders to stop the [[Gaza flotilla]] at all costs, as well as an offer of full support, directly from Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] ... Depending on one’s viewpoint, it is possible to perceive Shurat HaDin as either a nuisance or as a necessary resource for fighting terror. But either way, there are potential real world consequences that could result from its desire to punish anyone and everyone in any way linked to activity hostile to Israel ... It would also mean that the specious Israeli claim that they have no one to talk to among the Palestinians would become a reality."&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Giraldi|Giraldi, Philip]] (February 2015).

In two interviews on ''[[The Real News|The Real News Network]],'' [[Michael Ratner]], President Emeritus of the US-based ''[[Center for Constitutional Rights]]'' and president of the ''[[European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights]],''  said that Shurat HaDin was a Zionist propaganda arm for Israel, dedicated to filing suits all over the place, without necessarily expecting to win them.&lt;ref name=Real-News-Ratner-1&gt;[[Michael Ratner|Ratner, Michael]] (February 2015).

{{Polish Underground State sidebar}}

'''Special Courts''' ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''Sądy Specjalne'') were [[World War II]] underground [[court]]s in occupied [[Poland]], organized by the [[Polish government in exile|Polish Government-in-Exile]]. The courts determined [[punishment]]s for [[Poles|citizens of Poland]] who were subject to  Polish law before the war.
__NOTOC__
==History==
After the [[Invasion of Poland|Polish Defense War of 1939]]. the German authorities of the [[General Government]] mobilized all the pre-war Polish [[police]]men to the German service. The so-called [[Blue Police|Navy-Blue Police]] (''Policja granatowa'', nicknamed after the colour of their uniforms) were used as an auxiliary unit of the [[Gestapo]] and [[Kripo]], yet they had no means of executing law and order in the occupied country. At the same time, the German police forces and courts were more interested in persecution of Jews and members of Polish [[intelligentsia]] and [[Resistance during World War II|underground]] rather than common criminals.

First underground, ad hoc courts were created alongside some of the first Polish resistance organizations as early as in 1939.&lt;ref name="Salm"&gt;Stanisław Salmonowicz, ''Polskie Państwo Podziemne'', Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagogiczne, Warszawa, 1994, {{ISBN|83-02-05500-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, they were purely military, concerned only with the cases that would fall under military law (such as [[treason]]).&lt;ref name="Salm"/&gt; On April 16, 1940, the [[Polish government in exile|Polish Government in Exile]] in [[London]] decided that the underground Polish courts be created for prosecution of criminals, [[high treason|traitors]], [[informant]]s and [[collaboration|collaborators]].&lt;ref name="Salm"/&gt; The structure and law regulating those courts were mostly finalized around 1942.&lt;ref name="Salm"/&gt;

The Special Courts tried only the pre-war citizens of Poland who were legally subjects of the Polish law. No citizens of other states (including members of the occupying forces of [[Germany]] and [[USSR]]) were ever sentenced by the Special Courts. However, at times such claims were made by the [[Bureau of Information and Propaganda]] for [[propaganda]] reasons; nevertheless, executions of members of the [[SS]] and ''[[Gestapo]]'' were treated as elements of [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] warfare. The reason for such policy was a belief that the agendas of the [[Polish Underground State]] should act as if the occupation and dismemberment of Poland never happened.

Polish special underground courts reviewed about 10,000&lt;ref name=KPF&gt;{{cite journal|first=Klaus-Peter |last=Friedrich |title=Collaboration in a 'Land without a Quisling': Patterns of Cooperation with the Nazi German Occupation Regime in Poland during World War II |journal=[[Slavic Review]] |volume=64 |issue=4 |date=Winter 2005 |pages=711-746 |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/3649910 |doi=10.2307/3649910}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 17,000&lt;ref name="Connelly 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|first=John|last=Connelly|title=Why the Poles Collaborated so Little: And Why That Is No Reason for Nationalist Hubris|journal=Slavic Review|volume=64|number=4|year=2005|pages=771-781|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/3649912}}&lt;/ref&gt; cases of collaboration, sentenced over 3,500 individuals to death&lt;ref name=KPF/&gt; (2,500 executions were carried out;&lt;ref name=KPF/&gt; many others were sentenced to punishments like beatings or fines, or with a recommendation for review of the case after the war&lt;ref name="Salm"/&gt;).

==Debate==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2018}}
There is an ongoing debate whether the World War II Polish Special Courts were lawful and obeyed the elementary [[law]]s. According to the historians working for the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] the courts fulfilled the five basic conditions:
#The courts operated in the name of the Polish State and were subject to both pre-war Polish law and the wartime [[legislation]].
#The courts penalized mostly the misdeeds included in the pre-war Polish law. Most of the trials were related either to [[high treason]] or [[collaboration]].
#There are no sources that would claim that the Special Courts sentenced anyone without sufficient [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of [[guilt (law)|guilt]].
#The Special Courts were always trying to reach the lawful verdict. 40% of all the [[judicial procedure]]s ended up with the [[defendant]]s found not guilty.  Only 25% of the verdicts were for [[capital punishment]], while the rest included the [[Corporal punishment|lash]], [[infamy]], [[banishment]] or fines. In many cases, the prosecution was suspended until the final liberation.
#All of the procedures of the Polish law were obeyed. The only exception to that rule was the case of the so-called ''preemptive liquidation'', when a person known for being a German spy or collaborator had to be executed before he could denunciate the resistance net.

However, some German historians{{who|date=May 2018}} claim that after 1939 Poland did not exist, and the execution of Polish law on German-held territory was therefore against international law. These claims remain controversial, since the [[Administrative division of Polish territories during World War II|annexation of Poland in 1939]] was unilateral and acknowledged only by the [[Axis Powers]] and the [[USSR]] (which later declared [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|its pact with Germany]] null and void).

The '''Statute of the Council of Europe''' (also known as the '''Treaty of London (1949)''') is a treaty that was signed on 5 May 1949, which created the [[Council of Europe]]. The original signatories were [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[United Kingdom]]. A state formally joins the Council of Europe by ratifying the Statute.

As of 2013, it has been ratified or acceded to by 47 European states. All European states have ratified the Statute with the exception of [[Belarus]] and [[Vatican City]] (the [[Holy See]]).

The treaty was registered with the [[United Nations]] with treaty number I:1168, vol.87, page 103.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/Cumulative%20Index/UNTS%20Volume%20No%201-100/cumindex.chrono.en.pdf UN Cumulative Treaty Index]&lt;/ref&gt; Its date of registration was 11 April 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%2087/volume-87-I-1168-English.pdf Statute of the Council of Europe as registered with the UN]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Straw''' is an agricultural [[byproduct]] consisting of the dry [[wikt:stalk|stalk]]s of [[cereal]] plants after the [[grain]] and [[chaff]] have been removed. It makes up about half of the yield{{Clarify|reason=money? weight?|date=September 2018}} of cereal crops such as [[barley]], [[oat]]s, [[rice]], [[rye]] and [[wheat]].  It has a number of different uses, including [[fuel]], [[livestock bedding]] and [[fodder]], [[thatching]] and [[basket making]].

Straw is usually gathered and stored in a '''straw bale''', which is a [[wikt:bale|bale]], or bundle, of straw tightly bound with twine or wire. Straw bales may be square, rectangular, or round, and can be very large, depending on the type of [[baler]] used.

== Uses==

Current and historic uses of straw include:

* [[Fodder|Animal feed]]
**Straw may be fed as part of the [[roughage]] component of the diet to cattle or horses that are on a near maintenance level of energy requirement. It has a low digestible energy and nutrient content (as opposed to [[hay]], which is much more nutritious). The heat generated when microorganisms in a herbivore's gut digest straw can be useful in maintaining body temperature in cold climates. Due to the risk of [[impaction (animals)|impaction]] and its poor nutrient profile, it should always be restricted to part of the diet.  It may be fed as it is, or chopped into short lengths, known as [[chaff]].
* [[Basketry]]
** [[Bee skep]]s and linen baskets are made from coiled and bound together continuous lengths of straw. The technique is known as lip work.
* Bedding: humans or [[livestock]]
**The straw-filled mattress, also known as a [[palliasse]], is still used in many parts of the world.
**It is commonly used as bedding for ruminants and horses. It may be used as bedding and food for small animals, but this often leads to injuries to mouth, nose and eyes as straw is quite sharp.
* [[Biofuel]]s
**The use of straw as a carbon-neutral energy source is increasing rapidly, especially for [[biobutanol]]. Straw or hay briquettes are a biofuel substitute to coal.
* [[Biogas]]
**Straw, processed first as [[briquette]]s, has been fed into a biogas plant in Aarhus University, Denmark, in a test to see if higher [[gas]] yields could be attained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dca.au.dk/en/current-news/news/show/artikel/vejen-fra-toert-halm-til-brugbar-energi-forkortes-markant/|title=show|last=252507@au.dk|date=2017-06-30|website=dca.au.dk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Biomass]]
**The use of straw in large-scale biomass power plants is becoming mainstream in the EU, with several facilities already online. The straw is either used directly in the form of bales, or densified into pellets which allows for the feedstock to be transported over longer distances. Finally, [[torrefaction]] of straw with pelletisation is gaining attention, because it increases the energy density of the resource, making it possible to transport it still further. This processing step also makes storage much easier, because torrefied straw pellets are hydrophobic. Torrefied straw in the form of pellets can be directly co-fired with coal or natural gas at very high rates and make use of the processing infrastructures at existing coal and gas plants. Because the torrefied straw pellets have superior structural, chemical and combustion properties to coal, they can replace all coal and turn a coal plant into an entirely biomass-fed power station. First generation pellets are limited to a [[co-firing]] rate of 15% in modern [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]] plants.
*Construction material: 
**In many parts of the world, straw is used to bind clay and [[concrete]]. A mixture of clay and straw, known as [[cob (building)|cob]], can be used as a building material.  There are many recipes for making cob.
**When [[Baler|baled]], straw has moderate insulation characteristics (about R-1.5/inch according to Oak Ridge National Lab and Forest Product Lab testing).  It can be used, alone or in a post-and-beam construction, to build [[straw-bale construction|straw bale houses]]. When bales are used to [[Building construction|build]] or [[Thermal insulation|insulate]] buildings, the straw bales are commonly finished with [[earthen plaster]]. The plastered walls provide some [[thermal mass]], compressive and ductile structural strength, and acceptable fire resistance as well as thermal resistance (insulation), somewhat in excess of North American [[building code]]. Straw is an abundant agricultural waste product, and requires little energy to bale and transport for construction. For these reasons, straw bale construction is gaining popularity as part of [[passive solar]] and other [[renewable energy]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.earthhealing.info/strawbale.pdf The Straw Bale House: Suitability for the Eastern U.S.]&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Composite lumber]]: Wheat straw can be used as a fibrous filler combined with polymers to produce composite lumber.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/1367/adding-value-to-wheat-straw/ Adding Value to Wheat Straw By Anduin Kirkbride-McElroy.  Biomass Magazine, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Erosion control]]
**Straw bales are sometimes used for [[sediment control]] at [[construction]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casqa.org California Stormwater Quality Association.] Menlo Park, CA.
[http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/Documents/Construction/SE-9.pdf “California Stormwater BMP Handbook: Straw Bale Barrier.”] Best Management Practice (BMP) No. SE-9. January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, bales are often ineffective in protecting [[water quality]] and are maintenance-intensive.  For these reasons the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and various state agencies recommend use of alternative sediment control practices where possible, such as [[silt fence]]s, [[fiber roll]]s and [[geotextiles]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

* Hats
**There are several styles of [[straw hat]]s that are made of woven straw.
**Many thousands of women and children in England (primarily in the [[Luton]] district of Bedfordshire),&lt;ref name="eb9"&gt;{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Straw Manufactures|volume=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and large numbers in the United States (mostly [[Massachusetts]]), were employed in [[Straw Plaiting|plaiting straw]] for making hats.  By the late 19th century, vast quantities of plaits were being imported to England from Canton in China,&lt;ref name="eb9" /&gt; and in the United States most of the straw plait was imported.&lt;ref name="ac"&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Straw}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**A fiber analogous to straw is obtained from the plant ''[[Carludovica palmata]]'', and is used to make [[Panama hats]].&lt;ref name="ac" /&gt;
**Traditional Japanese rain protection consisted of a straw hat and a [[mino (straw cape)|mino cape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henshall|first1=Kenneth|title=A History of Japan: From Stone Age to Superpower|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780230346628|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vD76fF5hqf8C&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;pg=PA67|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Horticulture]]
**Straw is used in [[cucumber]] houses and for [[mushroom]] growing.
**In [[Japan]], certain trees are wrapped with straw to protect them from the effects of a hard winter as well as to use them as a trap for parasite insects.
**It is also used in ponds to reduce [[alga]]e by changing the nutrient ratios in the water.
**The soil under [[strawberry|strawberries]] is covered with straw to protect the ripe berries from dirt, and straw is also used to cover the plants during winter to prevent the cold from killing them.
**Straw also makes an excellent [[mulch]].
*[[Packaging]]
**Straw is resistant to being crushed and therefore makes a good packing material. A company in France makes a straw mat sealed in thin plastic sheets.
**Straw envelopes for wine bottles have become rarer, but are still to be found at some wine merchants.
**Wheat straw is also used in compostable [[food packaging]] such as compostable plates. Packaging made from wheat straw can be certified compostable and will biodegrade in a commercial composting environment.&lt;ref name="VBC"&gt;Viv Biz Club: [http://vivbizclub.com/products/biodegradable-food-packaging/compostable-plates/ Compostable Plates] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731150916/http://vivbizclub.com/products/biodegradable-food-packaging/compostable-plates/ |date=2010-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper
**[[File:Belarusian Straw Bird.jpg|thumb|Belarusian Straw Bird]]Straw can be pulped to make [[paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QbH9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=Straw+can+be+pulped+to+make+paper&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3zoywk-vUAhUM0GMKHUv6AEoQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Straw%20can%20be%20pulped%20to%20make%20paper&amp;f=false|title=Tomorrow's World: Britain's Share in a Sustainable Future|last=McLaren|first=Duncan|last2=Bullock|first2=Simon|last3=Yousuf|first3=Nusrat|date=2013-11-05|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=9781134044825|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Rope
**Rope made from straw was used by thatchers, in the packaging industry and even in iron foundries.
* [[Shoe]]s
** [[Koreans]] wear [[jipsin]], sandals made of straw.
** In some parts of Germany like [[Black Forest]] and [[Hunsrück]] people wear straw shoes at home or at carnival.
*Targets
**Heavy gauge straw rope is coiled and sewn tightly together to make [[archery]] targets. This is no longer done entirely by hand, but is partially mechanised.  Sometimes a paper or plastic target is set up in front of straw bales, which serve to support the target and provide a safe backdrop.
* [[Thatching]]
**Thatching uses straw, [[Reed (plant)|reed]] or similar materials to make a waterproof, lightweight roof with good insulation properties.  Straw for this purpose (often [[wheat]] straw) is grown specially and harvested using a [[reaper-binder]].

== Health and safety ==
Dried straw presents a fire hazard that can ignite easily if exposed to sparks or an open flame. It can also trigger [[allergic rhinitis]] in people who are hypersensitive to airborne allergens such as straw dust.

== Research==
In addition to its current and historic uses, straw is being investigated as a source of [[fine chemical]]s including [[alkaloid]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[lignin]]s, [[phenols]], and [[steroid]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid24138469"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schnitzer M, Monreal CM, Powell EE | title=Wheat straw biomass: A resource for high-value chemicals| journal=Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part B| year= 2014 | volume= 49 | issue= 1 | pages= 51–67 | pmid=24138469 | doi=10.1080/03601234.2013.836924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Succession to the Throne Act, 2013''''', which has the long title ''An Act to assent to alterations in the law touching the Succession to the Throne'' (Bill C-53),&lt;ref name=RA&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2013/2013-04-13/html/parliament-parlement-eng.html| last=Parliament of Canada| title=Royal Assent| journal=Canada Gazette| volume=147| issue=15| date=15 April 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the ''Act'') was passed by the [[Parliament of Canada]] to give assent to the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|Succession to the Crown Bill]], which was intended to change the line of succession to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian throne]] and was passed with amendments by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] on 25 April 2013. Bill C-53 was presented and received its first reading in the House of Commons on 31 January 2013 and received [[Royal Assent]] on 27 March of the same year. The ''Act'' was brought into force by the Governor General-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] on 26 March 2015.

Some academics disagreed over the act's constitutionality and effectiveness on altering the line of succession to the Canadian throne. A court motion filed in Ontario for the law to be found unconstitutional has been dismissed. Another court motion filed in Quebec was heard in June 2015 with a ruling issued in February 2016 upholding the ''Act''.

==Background==
{{main|Perth Agreement}}
After questions from the media were prompted in April 2011 by the introduction to the British parliament of a private member's bill seeking to change British royal succession from [[Primogeniture#Agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] to [[Primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute]], [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] was criticised for his ambivalence toward amendment of the line of succession in Canada, being contrasted with [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[John Key]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Nick Clegg]].&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/2011/04/28/pms_puzzling_reticence_on_the_monarchy.html| last=White| first=Randall| title=PM's puzzling reticence on the monarchy| date=28 April 2011| newspaper=Toronto Star| accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harper stated: "The successor to the throne is a man. The next successor to the throne is a man... I don't think Canadians want to open a debate on the monarchy or constitutional matters at this time. That's our position. I just don't see that as a priority for Canadians right now at all."&lt;ref name=White/&gt;

On 28 October 2011, at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011|Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] held in [[Perth]], Western Australia, the heads of government of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s announced that they would introduce legislation to end the primacy of males over females and the disqualification of persons married to Catholic spouses in the succession to the Crown.&lt;ref name=bbcgirlsequal&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15492607| title=Girls equal in British throne succession| date=28 October 2011| publisher=BBC| accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the other realms' heads of government, prior to the Perth Agreement, British Prime Minister David Cameron additionally proposed to limit the requirement to obtain the monarch's permission to marry to the first six people in line to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8822447/Royal-family-Cameron-begins-process-to-allow-first-born-daughters-to-accede-throne.html| title=Royal family: Cameron begins process to allow first born daughters to accede throne| date=12 October 2011| newspaper=The Telegraph| accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper stated in October 2011 that, "at some point, we will table legislation in the House of Commons and it would be my hope that that would be approved quickly." In an email to [[Postmedia News]] in December 2012, a spokesperson for the Prime Minister stated that the Canadian government was waiting for the British government to reveal its proposed legislation before "enact[ing] these changes in coordination with our realm partners." At the same time, a spokesperson for the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] (the official opposition in the [[41st Canadian Parliament|41st Parliament]]), explained the party is in favour of the reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://o.canada.com/2012/12/03/royal-baby-puts-need-for-speed-on-succession-law-reform/| last=Stechyson| first=Natalie| title=Royal baby puts need for speed on succession law reform| date=3 December 2012| publisher=Postmedia News| accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the federal minister of justice stated a constitutional amendment was not required and the minister intended to present the proposed legislation to parliament without obtaining the consent of the provinces.&lt;ref name=McGregor1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/01/25/pol-royal-baby-bill-advancer.html| last=McGregor| first=Janyce| title=Canada's royal baby bill risks constitutional complications| date=28 January 2013| publisher=CBC| accessdate=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bill C-53==

===Content of the bill===
The content of the act is identical to Bill C-53, which was passed unamended. From its inception as a bill the [[long title]] has been ''An Act to assent to alterations in the law touching the succession to the throne'' and the [[short title]] has been the ''Succession to the Throne Act, 2013''. As a bill, it consisted of a long preamble and three short provisions. The preamble outlined the monarch's powers as prescribed by the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'', followed by a summary of the [[Perth Agreement]] and the quoted preamble of ''[[Statute of Westminster 1931]]'', which expressed the convention that an alteration of the succession rules be assented to by the respective parliaments of all Commonwealth realms. It ended with the acknowledgement of the introduction of the ''[[Succession to the Crown Act 2013|Succession to the Crown Bill 2012]]'' in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Clause 1 provided the [[short title]]; clause 2 stated that the alteration in the law touching the succession to the throne set out in the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012 as laid before the British parliament "is assented to"; and clause 3 allowed the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] to determine the effective date.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;DocId=5955606&amp;File=24| last=Parliament of Canada| title=Bill C-53| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wording of clause 2 of the bill was nearly identical to the similar section in the ''[[Succession to the Throne Act 1937]]'', passed by the Parliament of Canada to legislatively ratify the Canadian Cabinet's earlier consent to the taking into the laws of Canada of ''[[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]'', the act of the British parliament that effected [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|the abdication]] of [[Edward VIII]] as king of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the other [[Dominion]]s. The ''Succession to the Throne Act 1937'' stated: "The alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne set forth in the Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom intituled 'His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act, 1936' is hereby assented to."&lt;ref name=TwomeyUoS&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/cru/2013/02/the_royal_succession_and_the_d.html| last=Twomey| first=Anne| authorlink=Anne Twomey| title=The royal succession and the de-patriation of the Canadian Constitution| date=4 February 2013| publisher=University of Sydney| accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Succession to the Throne Act 1937'', however, also included His Majesty's ''Declaration of Abdication Act 1936'' in a schedule,&lt;ref name=Toffoli3-4&gt;{{citation| url=http://crht.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CRHT-Background-Paper-on-Canadas-Law-of-Succession.pdf| last=Toffoli| first=Gary| title=Is There a Canadian Law of Succession and Is There a Canadian Process of Amendment?| date=9 February 2013| pages=3–4| publisher=Canadian Royal Heritage Trust| accessdate=12 February 2013| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; something the ''Succession to the Throne Act 2013'' does not do with the ''Succession to the Crown Bill 2012''.

On 5 February, the bill received its first reading in the Senate and the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012–13 was tabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/Sen/Chamber/411/Debates/133db_2013-02-05-e.htm#17| last=Parliament of Canada| title=Debates of the Senate: Tuesday, February 5, 2013| journal=Hansard| date=5 February 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill's second reading in the Senate took place on 7 March 2013 and it was referred to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/Sen/Chamber/411/Debates/144db_2013-03-07-e.htm?Language=E#38| last=Parliament of Canada| title=Debates of the Senate: Thursday, March 7, 2013| journal=Hansard| date=5 February 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Status&gt;{{cite web| last=Parliament of Canada| title=An Act to assent to alterations in the law touching the Succession to the Throne: Status of the Bill| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/LEGISInfo/BillDetails.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;billId=5947043| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, on 20 and 21 March, the committee heard from Associate Professor Andrew Heard of [[Simon Fraser University]]; Professor of Law Benoît Pelletier, from the [[University of Ottawa]]; Vice-Chairman Paul Benoit and Executive Director Garry Toffoli of the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/sencommitteebusiness/CommitteeMeetingSchedule.aspx?parl=41&amp;ses=1&amp;Language=E&amp;comm_id=11&amp;searchMeetings=1&amp;fromDate=2013-03-20&amp;toDate=2013-03-20| last=Senate of Canada| title=Meeting Schedule: 20 March 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rob Nicholson; Karen Audcent, Donald Piragoff, and Warren Newman from the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]]; and Joe Wild, Assistant Secretary to the Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/sencommitteebusiness/CommitteeMeetingSchedule.aspx?parl=41&amp;ses=1&amp;Language=E&amp;comm_id=11&amp;searchMeetings=1&amp;fromDate=2013-03-21&amp;toDate=2013-03-21| last=Senate of Canada| title=Meeting Schedule: 21 March 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was returned to the Senate from the committee on 21 March 2013, unamended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Senate of Canada| title=Senate Report| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/411/lcjc/rep/rep22mar13-e.htm| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third reading in the Senate and Royal Assent===
In debate during the third reading, on 25 and 26 March, Senator [[Joan Fraser]] said that the Canadian parliament was being asked to assent to a bill passed by a foreign parliament, the final form of which had not yet been seen, and that the Canadian bill was to give assent to the bill "laid before" the parliament at Westminster, which had been amended since first presented there. Fraser commented that when the Senate had given the bill third reading, she would take that as formal notification that assent was being given to the bill eventually passed in Westminster, but it would have been preferable if Canada had done as Australia and New Zealand were doing: instead of passing a bill to assent to another parliament's legislation, they were passing their own, standalone legislation, thereby asserting that the monarch of each country is whomever each country's laws determines it to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard| jurisdiction=Canada| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/Sen/Chamber/411/Debates/148db_2013-03-25-e.htm#27| house=Senate| date=25 March 2013| speaker=Joan Fraser| position=Senator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[Serge Joyal]] responded by saying that Bill C-53 assented to the British bill by its title, not all its clauses. He argued that the legal force of a bill is essentially a legislative intention, to which some precision can be given, as had been done through the amendments made to the Succession to the Crown Bill 2012 by the British parliament. The original intention approved by all of the 16 prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms had not been altered, but instead made more precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard| jurisdiction=Canada| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/Sen/Chamber/411/Debates/149db_2013-03-26-e.htm| house=Senate| date=26 March 2013| speaker=Serge Joyal| position=Senator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the cessation of debate, the bill passed unamended and received [[Royal Assent]] the next day.&lt;ref name=RA /&gt;

==Constitutional issues==
===Cabinet position===
During the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]] in 1936, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], wishing for speed so as to avoid embarrassing debate in Dominion parliaments, suggested that the governments of the Dominions of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]—then [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Irish Free State]], the [[Union of South Africa]], and Canada—regard whoever was monarch of the UK to automatically be monarch of their respective Dominion. As with the other Dominion governments, the Canadian Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]], refused to accept the idea and stressed that the laws of succession were part of Canadian law and thus altering them required Canada's request and consent to the British legislation ([[His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936]]) becoming part of Canadian law.&lt;ref name=Twomeyvid&gt;{{cite AV media| people=[[Anne Twomey]]| title=Professor Anne Twomey - Succession to the Crown: foiled by Canada?| medium=Digital video| publisher=University College London| location=London| date=18 September 2014| url=http://vimeo.com/108335929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Maurice Gwyer]], [[Office of the Parliamentary Counsel (United Kingdom)|first parliamentary counsel]] in the UK, reflected this position, stating the Act of Settlement was a part of the law in each Dominion.&lt;ref name=Twomeyvid /&gt;

In a meeting of the Special Joint Committee on the Constitution during the process of [[Patriation|patriating]] the Canadian constitution in 1981, [[John Munro (Canadian politician)|John Munro]] asked then [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] [[Jean Chrétien]] about the "selective omissions" of the ''Succession to the Throne Act 1937'', the ''[[Demise of the Crown Act 1901]]'', the ''Seals Act'', the ''Governor General's Act'', and the ''Royal Style and Titles Act, 1953'', from the schedule to the ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]''. In response, Chrétien asserted that the schedule to the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', was not exhaustive, outlining that section 52(2) of the ''Constitution Act 1982'' says “[t]he Constitution of Canada includes... the Acts and orders referred to the schedule" and "[w]hen you use the word 'includes'... it means that if ever there is another thing related to the Canadian constitution as part of it, should have been there, or might have been there, it is covered. So we do not have to renumerate [sic] the ones that you are mentioning."&lt;ref name=committee&gt;{{citation| author=Parliament of Canada; 32nd Parliament (1st Session)| title=Minutes of the Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and of the House of Commons on the Constitution of Canada| date=5 February 1981| volume=54| edition=106| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same meeting, Deputy Attorney General [[Barry Strayer]] stated: "Clause 52(2) is not an exhaustive definition of the Constitution of Canada so that while we have certain things listed in the schedule which are clearly part of the constitution, that does not mean that there are not other things which are part of the constitution... [The schedule] is not an exhaustive list."&lt;ref name=committee/&gt;

The government's stated position in 2013 was that "The changes to the laws of succession do not require a constitutional amendment. The laws governing succession are UK law and are not part of Canada's constitution. Specifically, they are not enumerated in the schedule to our ''Constitution Act, 1982'' as part of the Constitution of Canada. Furthermore, the changes to the laws of succession do not constitute a change to the 'office of The Queen', as contemplated in ''the Constitution Act, 1982''. The 'office of The Queen' includes the Sovereign's constitutional status, powers and rights in Canada. Neither the ban on the marriages of heirs to Roman Catholics, nor the common law governing male preference primogeniture, can properly be said to be royal powers or prerogatives in Canada. As the line of succession is therefore determined by UK law and not by the sovereign, the Queen's powers and rights have not been altered by the changes to the laws governing succession in Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/eng/1359650749665/1359650788754| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=Harper Government Introduces Legislation to Give Canadian Assent to Changes to the Laws Governing the Royal Line of Succession| date=31 January 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Nicholson| first=Rob| authorlink=Rob Nicholson| title=Changing the Line of Succession to the Crown| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=36| issue=Summer 2013| pages=8–9| publisher=Parliament of Canada| location=Ottawa| url=http://www.revparl.ca/36/2/36n2_13e_print.pdf| issn=0229-2548| accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial precedent===
The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared unanimously in the 1981 [[Patriation Reference]] that the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], a law requiring amendment to implement the desired changes to royal succession, is "undoubtedly in force as part of the law of Canada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://senparlvu.parl.gc.ca/Guide.aspx?viewmode=4&amp;categoryid=-1&amp;eventid=8763&amp;Language=E| last=Senate of Canada| title=LCJC Meeting No. 74| date=20 March 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=24 March 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614215631/http://senparlvu.parl.gc.ca/Guide.aspx?viewmode=4&amp;categoryid=-1&amp;eventid=8763&amp;Language=E| archivedate=14 June 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Supreme Court of Canada| title=Re: Resolution to amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 SCR 753| date=28 September 1981| page=785| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in ''[[O'Donohue v. Canada]]'' (2003) the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] found that the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] is "part of the laws of Canada" and the rules of succession are "by necessity incorporated into the Constitution of Canada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court| litigants=O'Donohue v.

Under section 41 of the Constitution Act 1982, changes to the office of the monarch require unanimous consent of all the provinces and the federal parliament. If changes to the line of succession to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian throne]] were found to fall under this provision, it is possible that any single provincial legislature—such as [[Quebec]]'s—could hinder any attempts at change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/events/public-seminars/201112/rules-of-succession|title=Changing the Rules of Succession and the Problem of the Realms|publisher=University College London|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thoughtundermined.com/?p=1892|title = A few thoughts on the monarchy|publisher=On procedure and politics|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution-unit.com/2011/10/20/royal-succession-rules-view-from-the-realms/|title=Royal Succession rules: view from the Realms|publisher=Constitution Unit Blog|date=20 October 2011| accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding+Canadian+throne/7651371/story.html| last=Bowden| first=James| last2=Philippe| first2=Lagassé| title=Succeeding to the Canadian throne| date=6 December 2012| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| accessdate=6 December 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130110062651/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Succeeding%2BCanadian%2Bthrone/7651371/story.html| archivedate=10 January 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aforementioned court decision, Justice J. Rouleau determined that "unilateral changes by Canada to the rules of succession" would be "a fundamental change in the office of the Queen" requiring authorizations pursuant to section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Ontario Superior Court of Justice| 2003| loc=[33]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precedent in question does not specify whether non-unilateral alterations to the rules of succession would also be considered a fundamental change in the office of Queen, requiring a constitutional amendment under the unanimous consent procedure. The judge stated that "a constitutional monarchy, where the monarch is shared with the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, is, in [his] view, at the root of [Canada's] constitutional structure".

===Provincial input===
As a matter of common practice for Senate committees reviewing legislation in which a province or territory may have interest, the clerk of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in March 2013 contacted each provincial cabinet. The only response came from [[Andrew Swan]], Manitoba's attorney general, who stated in a letter dated 6 March 2013 that, although the Government of Manitoba held no opposition to the proposed changes themselves, "alterations to the constitutional and legal framework of our nation require consultation with and participation by provinces and territories that is timely and meaningful" and stressed that the way in which Bill C-53 was proceeding would not be considered "a precedent for the process to be followed should other circumstances arise in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/06/24/pol-manitoba-royal-baby-bill.html| last=McGregor| first=Janice| title=Royal baby bill prompted Manitoba to warn Harper government| date=24 June 2013| publisher=CBC| accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentations to parliamentary committee===
Aside from the Minister of Justice, there were three presentations made to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-53.

Gary Toffoli and Paul Benoit of the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust outlined how the British and Canadian governments agreed during the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis in 1936]] that whoever is monarch of the UK is not automatically monarch of Canada and, thus, the alteration of the succession in Britain by British law would not extend to Canada without the latter's request and consent that it do so.&lt;ref name=CPAC&gt;{{cite AV media| people=Various| title=In Committee from the Senate: Legal and Constitutional Affairs - March 20, 2013| medium=Digital video| publisher=CPAC| location=Ottawa| date=20 March 2013| url=http://www.cpac.ca/en/digital-archives/?search=succession%20throne&amp;orderby=relevance| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413142423/http://www.cpac.ca/en/digital-archives/?search=succession%20throne&amp;orderby=relevance| archivedate=13 April 2015| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with that, Tofolli argued the term "Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" contained in the preamble to the ''Constitution Act, 1867'', should be interpreted at present not as the "Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" (the successor to the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland following the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922), as the government has claimed it should be read, but instead as the "Crown of Canada", as per both further, post-1922 constitutional development and the ''Interpretation Act, 1985''.&lt;ref name=CPAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Toffoli| first=Gary|author2=Benoit, Paul | title=More is Needed to Change the Rules of Succession for Canada| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=36| issue=Summer 2013| page=11| publisher=Parliament of Canada| location=Ottawa| url=http://www.revparl.ca/36/2/36n2_13e_print.pdf| issn=0229-2548| accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (He later wrote "there is no merit in arguing that there was evolution but that it stopped before the Statute of Westminster... [T]he Crown of Canada must be read as coincident with, not dependent upon, the Crown of the United Kingdom in the ''Constitution Act, 1867''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Toffoli| 2013| p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;) As further evidence of Canada and the UK having separate monarchical offices, Toffoli pointed to the [[Proclamation of accession of Elizabeth II|proclamation of Queen Elizabeth II's accession]] taking place in Canada before she was proclaimed sovereign in the UK.&lt;ref name=CPAC/&gt;

According to Toffoli and Benoit, Canada now has its own succession laws, not only via the principle of received law, but also by virtue of the Canadian Cabinet's request and consent to His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936, which, according to section 4 of the Statute of Westminster, brought that act to Canada as "part of the law of that Dominion". The Canadian parliament's subsequent Succession to the Throne Act 1937 (required only by convention outlined in the preamble to the Statute of Westminster) ratified the Cabinet's earlier action and contains the full text of ''His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act'', which itself outlines its effects on the ''Act of Settlement 1701'' and ''Royal Marriages Act 1772''. (Further proof of the existence of the Royal Marriages Act in Canadian law is, according to Toffoli, provided by the approval by the Queen in her Canadian Council in 1981 to the marriage of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] separately to the same approval given by the Queen in her British Council.&lt;ref name=CPAC/&gt;) Thus, Canada's Succession to the Throne Act 1937 "is the statutory repository of the law of Succession for Canada", meaning "it is irrelevant whether or not [the succession laws are enumerated in the schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982], as [the laws] had already been [patriated] in 1937..."&lt;ref name=Toffoli3-4 /&gt; Given the subsequent repeal of section 4 of the Statute of Westminster in Canada and the enactment of section 2 of the ''Canada Act, 1982'', the United Kingdom's ''Succession to the Crown Act 2012'' has no effect on Canada's succession laws, regardless of the Canadian parliament's assent to it.&lt;ref name=CPAC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb| Toffoli| 2013| p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed the Canadian parliament could possibly alter Canada's succession laws simply by amending Schedule 2 of the 1937 act. The necessity of the consent of the provinces open to debate.&lt;ref name=CPAC/&gt;

Andrew Heard, an associate professor at [[Simon Fraser University]], and Benoît Pelletier, a [[University of Ottawa]] professor, both members of the Monarchist League of Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/sites/default/files/documents/2014/1/427.pdf| title=Monarchist League Announces Succession Committee| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| volume=Spring 2014| issue=36| page=15| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed with the Cabinet's argument. Heard stated the ''Succession to the Throne Act, 2013'', was actually unnecessary, as Canadian law dictates that "whomever is the British monarch is [Canada's] head of state."&lt;ref name=Summary&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/LOP/LegislativeSummaries/41/1/c53-e.pdf| last=Legislative Summary of Bill C-53: Succession to the Throne Act, 2013| first=Michael| title=Legislative Summary of Bill C-53: Succession to the Throne Act, 2013| date=30 August 2013| page=8| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| location=Ottawa| number=41-1-C53-E| accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pelletier asserted the bill did not touch upon the constitutional powers of the Office of the Queen and, hence, was not a constitutional amendment requiring the support of the provincial legislatures.&lt;ref name=Summary/&gt;

In the 1991 publication ''Constitutional Change in the Commonwealth'', author Leslie Zines referred to the assertion by [[Peter Hogg]] that a change to the rules of monarchical succession in Canada would require a constitutional amendment according to section 41 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982''. Zines also claimed that, though the succession to Canada's throne was outlined by common law and the ''Act of Settlement 1701'', these were not part of the Canadian constitution, which "does not contain rules for succession to the throne."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWzgzAd6wtAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| last=Zines| first=Leslie| title=Constitutional Change in the Commonwealth| page=29| year=1991| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| isbn=9780521400398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Toporoski, writing three years later for the Monarchist League of Canada, stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;if, let us say, an alteration were to be made in the United Kingdom to the Act of Settlement 1701, providing for the succession of the Crown [it] is my opinion that the domestic constitutional law of Australia or Papua New Guinea, for example, would provide for the succession in those countries of the same person who became Sovereign of the United Kingdom. But this would not be true in Canada. There is no existing provision in our law, other than the Act of Settlement 1701, that provides that the King or Queen of Canada shall be the same person as the King or Queen of the United Kingdom. If the British law were to be changed and we did not change our law and by section 41 of the Constitution Act 1982 such a change would require resolutions of the House of Commons and the legislative assemblies of all the provinces to authorise a proclamation by the Governor-General to determine who the Sovereign of Canada should be... the Crown would be divided. The person provided for in the new law would become king or queen in at least some realms of the Commonwealth; Canada would continue on with the person who would have become monarch under the previous law...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Invisible Crown| publisher=Monarchy Canada| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| author=Toporoski, Richard| accessdate=20 April 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| archivedate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[University of Ottawa]] professor Philippe Lagassé expressed in the media his disagreement with the government's proposed method of changing the succession in Canada,&lt;ref name=McGregor1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=Canada's Royal Baby Bill| url=http://www.cbc.ca/allinaday/2013/01/31/canadas-royal-baby-bill/| series=All in a Day| network=CBC| airdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that, in the [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution, section 4 of the ''Statute of Westminster'' (which required Canada's request for and consent to a British law before any such law became part of the laws of Canada) was repealed and section 2 of the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]'', also part of the Canadian constitution, subsequently and absolutely disallowed the parliament of the United Kingdom from legislating for Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/Canada_Act_1982.html| last=Elizabeth II| title=The Canada Act, 1982| location=S.2| date=29 March 1982| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lagassé argued first that, as the Canadian Crown is a [[corporation sole]], in which the office and office holder are regarded by law as inseparable, changing how the office holder is selected is a change to the office itself and, secondly, that, by seeking Royal Consent to the bill from the Governor General (which is required for any proposed law that will affect the monarch's prerogatives and privileges),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/About/Parliament/LegislativeSummaries/bills_ls.asp?ls=c53&amp;Parl=41&amp;Ses=1&amp;source=library_prb&amp;Language=E| author=Parliament of Canada| title=Legislative Summary of Bill C-53: Succession to the Throne Act, 2013| date=30 August 2013| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Justice Minister indicated that the alteration to the succession does indeed touch on "the Sovereign's constitutional status, powers and rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/02/03/the-queen-of-canada-is-dead-long-live-the-british-queen/| last=Lagassé| first=Philippe| title=The Queen of Canada is dead; long live the British Queen| date=3 February 2013| journal=Maclean's| publisher=Rogers Media| accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Taillon, a professor of constitutional rights at [[Laval University]], wrote in ''[[Le Devoir]]'' that he also felt the alterations to the succession should trigger Section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and argued that certain laws related to the structures of the state were "constitutionalised" by the patriation of the constitution, despite not being listed in section 52(2) of the ''Constitution Act, 1982''; the ''[[Supreme Court Act]]'', for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.ledevoir.com/politique/canada/369907/une-occasion-de-sauver-ce-qui-reste-du-veto-du-quebec| last=Taillon| first=Patrick| title=Projet de loi sur la succession au trône d’Angleterre – Une occasion de sauver ce qui reste du veto du Québec!| date=2 February 2013| newspaper=Le Devoir| accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Twomey of the [[University of Sydney]] also alluded to Canada having its own laws of royal succession separate from those of the UK when she speculated in a paper on the matter of succession changes that "no United Kingdom law changing the law of succession could extend to Canada" and "[i]f, for example, Prince William had a first born daughter and a second born son, it is conceivable that if the United Kingdom changed its law of succession and Canada did not, the daughter would become Queen of the United Kingdom and the son would become King of Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| ssrn=1943287| last=Twomey| first=Anne| title=Changing the Rules of Succession to the Throne| date=12 October 2011| pages=10, 13| publisher=University of Sydney Law School| accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twomey later highlighted the fact that Canada is not included among the territories the British bill lists as being affected by it when law and she stated both that the Canadian bill was ineffective and the government's methods amounted to a "de-patriation of the Canadian constitution".&lt;ref name=TwomeyUoS /&gt;

A [[Queen's University]] professor of law, Mark Walters, supported the government's position, agreeing that Canada has no laws of succession, since the preamble of the Constitution Act 1867 (which states: "Whereas the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick have expressed their Desire to be federally united into One Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[sic]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of the United Kingdom") should be interpreted as meaning Canada must always have as its monarch the same person as is monarch of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He concluded that, though "it makes sense for the Canadian Parliament to comply with the convention that it recognizes [that its consent be granted to a change by Britain to its royal succession laws]", the Succession to the Throne Act 2013 is not necessary, since it "is not required by, and will have no effect upon, existing Canadian law".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/British+laws+Canadian+Crown/7977947/story.html| last=Walters| first=Mark| title=British laws and the Canadian Crown| date=17 February 2013| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the passage of the bill through parliament, Lee Ward, an associate professor of Political Science at the [[University of Regina]], wrote that the government's proposed method of altering the line of succession in Canada dissolved "the decades-old notion that the British Crown and Canadian Crown are separate legal entities, as Canada's government concedes that the British parliament will decide in the 21st century who will be our head of state", thereby possibly "requir[ing] radical reconsideration of the position of the monarchy in the Canadian constitution". Ward did, however, acknowledge the political desire to avoid embarking on amending the constitution with Canadian law, which would require the approval of all the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.leaderpost.com/news/Succession+rules+Complicated+path+doing+right+thing/8181155/story.html| last=Ward| first=Lee| title=

The [[Monarchist League of Canada]] supported the government's method of amending the succession,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://members.boardhost.com/monarchist/msg/1360128628.top| title=Talking points: dealing with republican arguments against Bill C-53| date=6 February 2013| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust and [[Citizens for a Canadian Republic]] stated, respectively, that the same was ineffectual and unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://crht.ca/supplementary-background-paper-on-succession-to-the-throne/| title=Statement on Changing the Rules of Succession| date=4 February 2013| publisher=Canadian Royal Heritage Trust| accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title=Royal succession bill unconstitutional| publisher=Citizens for a Canadian Republic| date=5 February 2013| url=http://www.canadian-republic.ca/media_release_02-05-13.html| accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; University of Toronto history lecturer Carolyn Harris noted a "political controversy" around the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Changing+rules+Royal+succession/7906692/story.html| last=Harris| first=Carolyn| title=Changing the rules of Royal succession| date=1 February 2013| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial review===
In the hearing of an application to the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]], presented on 7 March 2013, Bryan Teskey argued that the ''Succession to the Throne Act, 2013'' was unconstitutional, being in violation both of section 2 of the ''Canada Act 1982'' (as it endeavoured to allow a British law to have force in Canada) and of section 15 of the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' (as it assented to a law that does not eliminate the prohibition of Roman Catholics from the royal line of succession).&lt;ref name=Court /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/09/04/markham_law_graduate_fighting_catholic_ban_on_royal_succession.html| last=Gallant| first=Jacques| title=Markham law graduate fighting Catholic ban on royal succession| date=4 September 2013| newspaper=Toronto Star| accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/king+uOttawa+grad+challenging+succession+rules/8829959/story.html| last=Yogaretnam| first=Shaamini| title=The boy who won’t be king: uOttawa law grad challenging succession rules| date=24 August 2013| newspaper=Ottawa Citizen| accessdate=4 September 2013| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827112731/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/king+uOttawa+grad+challenging+succession+rules/8829959/story.html| archivedate=27 August 2013| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the earlier Ontario Superior Court case [[O'Donohue v. Canada]], in which section II of the ''Act of Settlement'' was challenged, Justice Charles Hackland on 9 August dismissed Teskey's case, stating the rules of succession are both a part of the constitutional law of Canada, and thus cannot be invalidated by another part of the constitution (the charter), and beyond the review of the court.&lt;ref name=Court /&gt; Though the ruling confirmed the ''Act of Settlement 1701'' is a part of Canadian law, it made no mention of the matter of Section 2 of the ''Canada Act'' or how the ''Act of Settlement'' in Canadian law would be affected by a British Act of Parliament.&lt;ref name=Court /&gt; Teskey appealed the decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://lawtimesnews.com/201309023425/headline-news/law-grad-plans-appeal-after-royal-succession-challenge-dismissed| last=Taddese| first=Yamri| title=Law grad plans appeal after royal succession challenge dismissed| date=2 September 2013| newspaper=Law Times| accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in August 2014, the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] upheld the lower court decision.&lt;ref name=ctv&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal succession law not subject to charter challenge: court|url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/royal-succession-law-not-subject-to-charter-challenge-court-1.1977651|accessdate=August 29, 2014|work=CTV News|date=August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court| litigants=Teskey v.

On 7 June 2013, two professors from [[Laval University]], Geneviève Motard and Patrick Taillon,&lt;ref name=Motion&gt;{{citation| url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.documentcloud.org/documents/712552/motard-taillon-requete-jugement-declaratoire.txt| last=Motard| first=Geneviève| last2=Taillon| first2=Patrick| title=Motion to Institute Proceedings for Declaratory Judgement| date=6 June 2013| publisher=Joli-Cœur Lacasse| accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported as representing a group with "a broad spectrum of political views in Quebec: some sovereigntist, some federalist, some supportive of the monarchy and others with more republican views",&lt;ref name=CBCchallenge&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/11/pol-royal-baby-bill-legal-challenge.html| last=McGregor| first=Janice| title=Royal baby law challenge could end up at Supreme Court| date=12 June 2013| publisher=CBC| accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; filed a motion with the [[Quebec Superior Court]] asking for the ''Succession to the Throne Act, 2013'', to be ruled unconstitutional. It stated that its aim was not to contest the political decision to amend the rules regarding the designation of the head of state, but instead argued the act endeavours to amend the constitution—specifically the parts designating "the head of state of both federal and provincial orders of government"&lt;ref name=Motion/&gt;—but its enactment did not follow the constitutional amending formula set out in section 41 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982''; if the act does not amend the constitution, it is in violation of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' because it assents to a bill that does not repeal those provisions of the ''Act of Settlement'' disallowing Roman Catholics from becoming monarch of Canada; and it also approves of a British bill not written in both French and English, as required of Canadian legislation by the constitution.&lt;ref name=Motion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/changes-to-royal-succession-face-legal-fight-in-quebec/article12401224/| last=Sèguin| first=Rhèal| title=Changes to royal succession face legal fight in Quebec| date=7 June 2013| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motard and Taillon further argued that rules of succession dating back to 17th century have been [[Jurisprudential reception|received into]] Canadian constitutional law and that the Crown has been divisible, with one person being separate sovereigns for each of the Commonwealth realms and thus Canada having a crown that is unique from Britain's or other realms', since the ''Statute of Westminster 1931'' and that the practice of the Canadian parliament assenting to the application of British legislation to Canada ended with the [[patriation]] of the Canadian constitution in 1982 and the repeal of Section 4 of the ''Statute of Westminster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/michael-valpy-who-takes-the-crown| last1=Valpy| first1=Michael| title=Who takes the Crown?| date=8 June 2015| newspaper=National Post| accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Motard and Taillon's lawyer asserted that the federal government's position is that "British law applies automatically in Canada", which he described as "colonial".&lt;ref name=challenge&gt;{{cite news|title=Canadian law professors challenge 'colonial' law on royal succession|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/31/canadia-challenge-colonial-law-royal-succession|accessdate=31 May 2015|work=The Guardian|date=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before launching their challenge, the plaintiffs consulted with "like-minded lawyers, academics and monarchy experts from across Canada".&lt;ref name=CBCchallenge/&gt; On 14 June 2013, Antonia Maioni, an associate professor from McGill University, noted that she found it ironic that [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignists]] were basing their attempts to "shore up Quebec's veto" over constitutional change based on the argument that Elizabeth II is also the "[[Monarchy in Quebec|Queen of Quebec]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/you-say-succession-i-say-secession/article12523154/#dashboard/follows/| title=Quebec and the monarchy: You say succession, I say secession| date=14 July 2013| agency=The Globe and Mail| accessdate=2013-06-17| last=Maioni| first=Antonia| location=Montreal}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was reported in July 2013 that the [[Government of Quebec|Quebec Crown]]-[[Queen-in-Council|in-Council]] had joined as an intervener in support of the challenge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation| title=Royal Baby Bill Challenge Joined By Quebec Attorney General| date=22 July 2013| newspaper=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Post-22-07-13&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2013/07/22/quebec-government-to-mount-legal-challenge-to-new-royal-succession-law/| last=Blanchfield| first=Mike| title=Quebec government to mount legal challenge to new royal succession law| date=22 July 2013| newspaper=National Post| accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supported by the Canadian Royal Heritage Trust.&lt;ref name=challenge/&gt;

The federal justice minister had the option of referring the question directly to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] for a final ruling,&lt;ref name=CBCchallenge/&gt; though a spokesperson for the minister stated that this possibility would not be pursued.&lt;ref name=Post-22-07-13/&gt; A preliminary hearing took place on 15 August 2013.&lt;ref name=Post-22-07-13/&gt; The hearing in [[Quebec City]], before Justice Claude Bouchard of the Quebec Superior Court, began on 1 June 2015.&lt;ref name=challenge/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://roles.tribunaux.qc.ca/| author=Ministère de la Justice| title=Extraits des rôles d'audience| accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government was due to reply by 10 October, with another month for a reply from the challenging parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2015/06/15/quebec-challenge-to-britains-line-of-succession/| last=Kilkenny| first=Carmel| title=Quebec challenge to Britain’s Line of Succession| date=15 June 2015| publisher=CBC| accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 2016, Bouchard ruled that Canada "did not have to change its laws nor its Constitution for the British royal succession rules to be amended and effective" and [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] committed Canada to having a lines of succession symmetrical to those of other Commonwealth realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deux profs de l'Université Laval déboutés dans la cause du "bébé royal"|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/justice-et-faits-divers/201602/16/01-4951299-deux-profs-de-luniversite-laval-deboutes-dans-la-cause-du-bebe-royal.php|accessdate=16 February 2016|work=Le Soleil|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=quebecappeal&gt;{{cite news|title=La cause du "bébé royal" en appel|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/le-soleil/actualites/societe/201603/14/01-4960730-la-cause-du-bebe-royal-en-appel.php| last=Sèguin| first=Rhèal| date=15 March 2016 |newspaper=Le Soleil| accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling was appealed by the plaintiffs and a hearing was held by the [[Quebec Court of Appeal]] in February 2018, but a decision has not yet been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marin|first1=Stephanie|title=Quebec Court of Appeal hearing case about who can inherit Canada's Crown|url=https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-court-of-appeal-hearing-case-about-who-can-inherit-canada-s-crown-1.3809400|accessdate=April 26, 2018|work=CTV News|agency=Canadian Press|date=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7951">[[File:TheAllstonMall 1.jpg|thumb|The second floor hallway at 107 Brighton Avenue, Allston, Massachusetts, location of The Allston Mall]]
'''The Allston Mall''' was the provisional name for a space located on the second floor at 107 Brighton Avenue, [[Allston]], [[Massachusetts]], USA. Owned by Marsha Berman (Linden Realty Associates) from approximately 1960 to 2005, it was home to countless examples of low rent alternative entrepreneurialism and cultural experimentation. It also provided off-and-on illegal housing to a number of marginal types. The building itself is a two-storey, mixed-use, commercial brick building constructed somewhere around 1900. It is still in use today but is no longer owned by Berman.

==Enterprises==
Some of the better-known enterprises in this second-floor area were the Primal Plunge Bookstore (1987–1995), 88 Room art gallery (1988–1998), Naked City Coffee House, the office of Quimby Magazine (1985–1990), Garage Video (1995-2000) and the broadcast space of Radio Free Allston (1997).

===The Primal Plunge Bookstore===
The Primal Plunge Bookstore was founded and operated by Michael McInnis in 1987, who later sold it to Steven Svymbersky, founder of Quimby Bookstore in [[Chicago]]. The store was primarily an outlet for the then burgeoning genre of “[[Zines]]”, self-published and usually photocopied magazines that created an outlet for a variety of [[D.I.Y.]] inclinations. Additionally, the Primal Plunge organized events in the huge central hall around which individual stores and offices were arranged. Notable events included an exhibition of paintings by convicted serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]], screenings of films by [[Nick Zedd]], a performance by punk rocker [[GG Allin]], and a weekly screening of arcane educational films.

===88 Room===
88 Room was an alternative visual arts space that concentrated on thematic and conceptually oriented exhibitions. It was founded by Andrew Guthrie, Angela Mark, and Michael Shores in 1988 (hence the name: 88 Room). After one year Mark and Shores dropped out leaving Guthrie to run the space for another nine years. The space was decidedly non-profit, addressing some of the social and cultural issues of the times, most notably the withdrawal of [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] grants from controversial artists in the late 1980s. Gaining a positive reputation among local emerging artists, the gallery was under-reported in the local media. Some notable show were “Pillow Talk”, an exhibition that addressed human sexuality, curated by the collaborative team “Dear Me Suz”: Guthrie, Cheri Eisenberg, and Ron Platt (then an assistant curator at [[MIT]] [[List Visual Arts Center]]) and “Unknown NY”, a group show curated by Winston C. Robinson that featured a hardly-known-at-the-time [[Karen Kilimnik]]. The 88 Room was incorporated as a tax exempt non-profit under the name Local Idea Council, Inc., which occasionally mounted exhibitions at the same location after 88 Room had folded.

===The Naked City Coffee House===
The Naked City Coffee House grew out of Naked City magazine (which for a time had offices at 107 Brighton Avenue) published by Al Nidle who later founded the Zeitgeist Gallery in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]]. The Naked City Coffee House was a weekly open mic forum for singer/songwriters and poets. It is where folk singer/songwriter Dar Williams performed for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQZuqKtYs-U Acoustic Guitar Sessions Presents Dar Williams], Published on Aug 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quimby Magazine===
Quimby Magazine was a monthly magazine organized by a group of local artists and friends headed by Steven Svymbersky. It shared offices with The Primal Plunge space. The magazine included comics, writing, and visual art. Svymbersky later moved to Chicago and used the name of the magazine for his bookstore.

===Garage Video===
Garage Video was a specialty video store that focused on hard to get B-movies and foreign films.  Also, Garage video hosted video nights and live music events locally.  In 1995, during the difficult first year of the business, the owner-manager of the shop was an example of an illegal tenant living in the Allston Mall.  When business improved, so did his living arrangements and he moved into an apartment.

===Radio Free Allston/Allston-Brighton Free Radio===
Radio Free Allston was started by Steve Provizer using a 20-watt [[FM broadcasting|FM]] broadcaster bought through a mail order supplier. It was on the air from May to October 1997.  Radio Free Allston broadcast from the 88 Room, which at this stage had been only intermittently producing exhibitions.  The station was technically illegal, operating without a [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) license, but Provizer sought to distance himself and Radio Free Allston from the descriptive “[[Pirate Radio]]” by providing a community service in the form of news programming, senior citizen shows, minority forums, and interviews with local businesses, politicians, artists, and social activists. In addition, a wide range of music programming included, but was not limited to, [[Hip-Hop]], [[Latin]], and all genres of [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Roots revival|Roots]], and [[R&amp;B]]. Day-to-day operations, fund raising, equipment maintenance, and logistics depended on a core of dedicated volunteers. The station was awarded a certificate of merit by the [[Boston City Council]], but was shut down by the FCC a few days before its first 72-hour broadcast featuring a [[House music|House]], [[Drum and Bass]], [[Hip-Hop]] DJing marathon. Allston-Brighton Free Radio followed in Radio Free Allston's footsteps, a free-form AM radio station that existed off and on in the Mall from 2000 to 2005 and featured a wide array of programming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">The '''Treaty of Whampoa''' ({{zh|t=黃埔條約|s=黄埔条约|p=Huángpǔ Tiáoyuē}}) was a commercial treaty between [[France]] and [[Qing Dynasty|China]], which was signed by [[Marie Melchior Joseph Théodore de Lagrené|Théodore de Lagrené]] and [[Qiying]] on October 24, 1844 aboard the warship ''L’Archimède''. It is considered an [[unequal treaty]] by many sources.

==Terms==
Based on the terms of the accord, [[China]] granted the same privileges to the [[July Monarchy|Kingdom of France]] as it had done to Britain in the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and subsequent treaties. These privileges included the opening of five harbors to French merchants, extraterritorial privileges French citizens in China, a fixed tariff on Sino-French trade and the right of France to station consuls in China.

==Toleration of Christianity==
Although French prime minister [[Guizot]] only had given Lagrené a mandate to negotiate a commercial treaty with France, Lagrené decided that he wanted to enhance France's international prestige by securing a rescission of [[Yongzheng Emperor]]'s prohibition of [[Christianity]] in China from 1724. By so doing, France could become the [[Protectorate of missions|protectorate]] of Catholics in China, just like France played the same role in the [[Levant]]. After protracted negotiations with Qiying, most of which Lagrené entrusted to his interpreter [[:fr:Joseph-Marie Callery|Joseph-Marie Callery]], the [[Daoguang Emperor]] issued an edict in February 1846, which legalized the practice of Christianity in China.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">The '''Vũng Tàu Charter''' (Hiến chương Vũng Tàu) was a provisional new constitution for [[South Vietnam]] which was introduced on the 16 August 1964 by General [[Nguyễn Khánh]].&lt;ref&gt;Rufus Phillips ''Why Vietnam matters: an eyewitness account of lessons not learned'' 2008 -"Later, at a meeting with [[Maxwell D. Taylor|Ambassador Taylor]] in Vung Tau, Khanh discussed his proposed new constitution. ... to Saigon and proclaimed the new constitution, popularly known as the "Vung Tau Charter," with himself as president."&lt;/ref&gt; It was known as the Vũng Tàu Charter from Khanh's preferred coastal residence in [[Vũng Tàu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ken Post ''Revolution, Socialism, and Nationalism in Viet Nam'' 1989 "... that the constitution (known as the Vung Tau Charter from Khanh's preferred coastal residence) was only provisional and ... Doubtless one of his reasons for preferring to be in Vung Tau, whence he could easily escape, on the 24th was the report that the [[Great Viet]] leaders had planned a coup for that day working through [[Trần Thiện Khiêm|General Khiem]], the Minister of Defence."&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution led to the [[Buddhist crisis]], large scale protests in the country led by [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhist]] groups, as the constitution reduced civilian representation in the government, gave Khanh the President's role and  would have allowed press censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Nghia M. Vo ''Saigon: A History'' - Page 146  2011 "The Buddhists demonstrated and demanded the revocation of the Vũng Tàu charter. Under pressure, Khánh gave in to Buddhists' demands. To appease the Buddhists, he had the army remove all its Catholic chaplains. Buddhist [[Trí Quang]] pressured Khánh to give [[Đặng Sỹ]], the Catholic officer who had confronted the Buddhists in Huế, a life sentence. He demanded that [[Ngô Đình Cẩn|Cẩn]], Diệm's brother, be put to death, which Khánh did.7 Street demonstrations continued unabated in September and October, forcing markets, stores, and schools to close and disrupting civilian life."&lt;/ref&gt; This led [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] to state that South Vietnam would have to show signs of political cohesion and stability before there would be military intervention against the North.

==Background==
During the immediate [[U.S. government response to the September 11 attacks]], federal officials sought out and detained illegally present aliens, arresting 762 in all, 60% in the New York area.&lt;ref name="theatlantic"&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Garrett Epps]]|title=Do Counterterrorism Lawsuits Stand a Chance in Court?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/10/hasty-vs-turkmen/504086/|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aliens “of high interest” to national security would not be deported but were instead “held until cleared” by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations]].&lt;ref name=theatlantic/&gt;  84 of these aliens were held by the MDC.

On April 17, 2002, plaintiffs sued in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]], alleging that the [[United States Department of Justice]] and MDC's behavior violated both the [[Equal Protection Clause]] and the [[substantive due process]] clause, and that they had a right to sue under an [[implied cause of action]] created by ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3506&amp;context=bclr Sonja Marrett, Note, Turkmen v. Hasty: ''The Second Circuit Holds Highest Ranking Law Enforcement Officials Accountable for Post-9/11 Policies Infringing on Constitutional Rights''], 57 B.C.L. Rev. 194 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit charges that the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] unlawfully held the plaintiffs several months after the completion of immigration cases brought against them to allow the [[FBI]] to investigate potential links to terrorism, an alleged violation of their [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights. The suit additionally alleges that the conditions of detainment of these prisoners, as well as the length of detainment, violated their rights, as prisoners were held in the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (ADMAX SHU); deprived contact with their attorneys, families, and friends; prevented from the practice of their religions; and treated inhumanely in various ways, including being verbally and physically abused. [[David D. Cole]], a professor at [[Georgetown University Law Center]], is one of the attorneys on the case.&lt;ref name=DavidDCole&gt;

On June 14, 2006, U.S. District Judge [[John Gleeson (judge)|John Gleeson]] refused to dismiss the plaintiffs’ substantive due process and equal protection claims.  In February 2008, the case was reviewed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], including then-Circuit Judge [[Sonia Sotomayor]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes6/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewYorkLawJournal&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 18, 2009, a two judge panel of the Second Circuit affirmed in an unsigned [[per curiam decision]], with Sotomayor not participating due to her elevation to the Supreme Court of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8036437528801420056&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2006 ''Turkmen v. Ashcroft'', 589 F.3d 542 (2d Cir. 2009).]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Second Circuit remanded to Judge Gleeson for further consideration under the new pleading standards created by ''[[Ashcroft v. Iqbal]]'' (2009), a separate case regarding conditions at the MDC.

On November 3, 2009 The Center for Constitutional Rights announced that the six Metropolitan Detention Center plaintiffs had settled their claims against the United States for 1.26 million dollars.&lt;ref name=harpers17/&gt;

Plaintiffs eventually filed four amended complaints, incorporating by reference April&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/0306/full.pdf U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, ''The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks'' (April 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; and December 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/0312/final.pdf U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, ''Supplemental Report on September 11 Detainees' Allegations of Abuse at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York'' (Dec. 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General]] reports investigating the abuses at MDC.  On January 15, 2013, Judge Gleeson dismissed all claims against the federal DOJ defendants but denied the MDC defendants' motions to dismiss the constitutional conditions of confinement claims, the unreasonable strip search claim, and the conspiracy claim.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2948252922928682970&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Turkmen v. Ashcroft'', 915 F. Supp. 2d 314 (E.D.N.Y. 2013).]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2015, the Second Circuit ruled that the case could proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|title=Immigrants’ Lawsuit Over Post-9/11 Detention Is Revived|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/us/immigrants-suit-over-detention-after-9-11-is-revived.html|accessdate=20 September 2015|work=The New York Times|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second Circuit Judges [[Rosemary S. Pooler]] and [[Richard Wesley]] affirmed Judge Gleeson with regard to the MDC defendants but reversed with regard to his dismissal of the claims against the DOJ defendants, over dissenting Judge [[Reena Raggi]]'s argument that the DOJ defendants were entitled to [[qualified immunity]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11534120569735937249&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2006 ''Turkmen v. Hasty'', 789 F.3d 218 (2d Cir. 2015).]&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 11, 2015, a judge’s request for rehearing [[en banc]] was denied by an equally divided circuit, with Judges Raggi, [[Dennis Jacobs]], [[José A. Cabranes]], [[Peter W. Hall]], [[Debra Ann Livingston]] and [[Christopher F. Droney]] dissenting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11534120569735937249&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=2006 ''Turkmen v. Hasty'', 808 F.3d 197 (2d Cir. 2015)(joint dissent from denial of rehearing en banc).]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court==
On February 29 and April 1, 2016, Circuit Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] granted the [[Solicitor General of the United States]]’s applications to extend the deadline to file a petition for a writ of [[certiorari]].  On October 11, 2016, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case, with Justices Sotomayor and [[Elena Kagan]] recusing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=[[Adam Liptak]]|first1=|title=Case Accusing Bush Officials of 9/11 Abuses Heads to Supreme Court|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/us/politics/supreme-court-9-11-muslim-bush-administration.html|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2016|page=A13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Commentators are not optimistic for the plaintiffs, noting that the Supreme Court has granted all eight of the government's last requests to review counterterrorism cases it had lost below, and that the plaintiffs have never then won.&lt;ref name=theatlantic/&gt;  On January 18, 2017, one hour of oral argument was heard, where [[Ian Heath Gershengorn]], the acting [[Solicitor General of the United States]], appeared for the federal petitioners, a private attorney appeared for the MDC Warden, and the CCR’s Meeropol appeared for the detainees.&lt;ref name=harpers17/&gt;

===Opinion of the Court===
On June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in favor of the federal officials, reversing in part, vacating in part, and remanding by a vote of 4-2.&lt;ref name=nyt20june17&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liptak|first1=Adam|authorlink=Adam Liptak|title=Supreme Court Rules for Bush Officials in Post-9/11 Suit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/us/politics/supreme-court-9-11-bush-ashcroft-mueller.html|accessdate=4 December 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 June 2017|page=A15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], joined fully by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] and Justice [[Samuel Alito]], and partially by Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], found that the [[implied cause of action]] created by ''[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents]]'' (1971) should not be extended to reach the federal officials' detention policy.&lt;ref name=harv&gt;[https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/313-322_Online.pdf ''The Supreme Court, 2016 Term — Leading Cases''], 131 Harv. L. Rev. 313 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|315}}

The Court began by recounting the history of the ''Bivens'' remedy, noting that the Court has since only extended it twice, in 1979 for gender discrimination and in 1980 for [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|313}}  Calling that era an "''[[ancien regime]]''", the Court explained that it is now more mindful of [[separation of powers]] by looking for clear [[legislative intent]] before allowing claimants to seek [[damages]].&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|315}}

If a claim arises in a new context to ''Bivens'', then some special factor must be identified that makes the judiciary better suited than the legislature to deciding that there is a new [[cause of action]].&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|315}}  The Court first found that the claims regarding the federal government's detention policy were in a new context because they bore little resemblance to familiar ''Bivens'' claims.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|316}}  Next, the Court found that there was no special factor calling for judicial intervention, highlighting that the claimed damages regard national security decisions by high level Executive Branch officials in response to a terrorist attack, that there was Congressional silence in response, and that alternative relief was available to the detainees through an [[injunction]] or the writ of [[habeas corpus]].&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|316}}  As such, the detainees could not sue the federal officials.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|316}}

The Court next found that the claims of detainee abuse against MDC Warden Hasty were in a new context to ''Bivens'' because prior precedent regarded the prison abuse of convicted felons in violation of the Eighth Amendment, rather than the detainees’ claims under the Fifth Amendment.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|316}}  The majority remanded the claims against Warden Hastey to the lower court for it to analyze any special factors.  Finally, the Court granted each defendant [[qualified immunity]] on the civil [[conspiracy]] claim, acknowledging without resolving the longstanding [[circuit split]] regarding the impossibility of conspiring within a single government department.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|317}}

===Justice Thomas' concurrence in part and concurrence in judgment===
Thomas refused to join the paragraph in the opinion of the Court remanding the lawsuit against MDC Warden Hasty.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;{{rp|317}}

===Justice Breyer's dissent===
Justice [[Stephen Breyer]], joined by Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], respectfully dissented.  Breyer disagreed strongly enough to read his dissent aloud from the bench at the opinion announcement.&lt;ref name=nyt20june17/&gt;
