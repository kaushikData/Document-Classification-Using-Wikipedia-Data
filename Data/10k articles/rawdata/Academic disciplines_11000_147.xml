An '''adapter''' or '''adaptor''', or a linker in [[genetic engineering]] is a short, chemically synthesized, single-stranded or double-stranded oligonucleotide that can be ligated to the ends of other DNA or RNA molecules. Double stranded adapters can be synthesized to have blunt ends to both terminals or to have sticky end at one end and blunt end at the other. For instance, a [[Double-stranded DNA|double stranded]] [[DNA]] adapter can be used to link the [[DNA end|ends]] of two other DNA molecules (i.e., ends that do not have "sticky ends", that is complementary protruding single strands by themselves). It may be used to add [[sticky ends]] to [[cDNA]] allowing it to be ligated into the [[plasmid]] much more efficiently. Two adapters could base pair to each other to form [[Pyrimidine dimer|dimers]].
A conversion adapter is used to join a DNA insert cut with one [[restriction enzyme]],  say [[EcoR1|EcoRl]], with a vector opened with another enzyme, [[Bam H1|Bam Hl]]. This adapter can be used to convert the cohesive end produced by Bam Hl to one produced by Eco Rl or vice versa.
One of its applications is ligating cDNA into a plasmid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmad|first=G.I.|date=2014|title=Biosurfactant Production By Bacillus subtilis Using Engine Oil As Substrate|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296425848_BIOSURFACTANT_PRODUCTION_BY_BACILLUS_SUBTILIS_USING_ENGINE_OIL_AS_THE_SUBSTRATE?ev=prf_high|publisher=Department of Biosciences, Suresh Gyan Vihar University, Jaipur}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other vectors instead of using Terminal deoxynucleotide Transferase enzyme to add poly A to the cDNA fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, B.D (2003).

'''Andreas Brandstädt''' (born 17 January 1949 in [[Arnstadt]], [[East Germany]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]].

==Life and work==
He graduated from the Friedrich Schiller [[University of Jena]], [[Germany]], with a Ph.D. (Dr. rer. nat.) in stochastics in 1976 and a habilitation (Dr. sc. nat.) in complexity theory in 1983.
Since 1974 he worked there in the group of his academic teacher [[Gerd Wechsung]].

From 1991 to 1994, he was the professor for Computer Science in the Department of Mathematics,
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uni-due.de/mathematik/en_index.php&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Duisburg]], Germany,
and from 1994 to 2014 he was the professor for Theoretical Computer Science&lt;ref&gt;http://users.informatik.uni-rostock.de/~ab&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Rostock]], Germany.

He was a visiting professor at the universities of [[University of Metz|Metz]], [[University of Amiens|Amiens]], and [[University of Clermont-Ferrand|Clermont-Ferrand]] ([[France]]) and at the [[University of Primorska]] in [[Koper]]
([[Slovenia]]). He was Invited Speaker at various conferences in [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Belarus]], [[Brasil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[France]],
[[Greece]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], and [[Switzerland]].

Brandstädt is an active researcher in [[graph algorithms]], [[discrete mathematics]], [[combinatorial optimization]], and [[graph theory]]. A frequently used tool in his papers is tree structure of graphs and hypergraphs such as for [[hypertree]]s, [[strongly chordal graph]]s and [[chordal graph]]s.

He frequently took part in program committees such as Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (and three times was a co-organizer of this
conference) and is member of the [[Editorial Board]] of [[Discrete Applied Mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.journals.elsevier.com/discrete-applied-mathematics/editorial-board/ Editorial Board of Discrete Applied Mathematics&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], '''antimetabole''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|t|ᵻ|m|ə|ˈ|t|æ|b|ə|l|iː}} {{respell|AN|ti-mə|TAB|ə-lee}}) is the repetition of words in successive clauses, but in transposed order; for example, "I know what I like, and I like what I know". It is related to, and sometimes considered a special case of, [[chiasmus]].

An antimetabole is also said to be a little too predictive because it is easy to reverse the key term, but it can pose questions that one usually would not think of if the phrase were just asked or said the initial way.&lt;ref&gt;Fahnestock, Jeanne. Rhetorical Figures in Science. Oxford University Press, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;123-134.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aquatic respiration''' is the [[Biological process|process]] whereby an [[aquatic animal]] obtains [[oxygen]] from [[water]].

==Respiratory systems==

===Fish===
{{see also|Fish respiration}}

In most fish respiration takes place through [[Gills (biology)#Vertebrate gills|gills]]. [[Lungfish]], however, possess one or two lungs. The [[Anabantoidei|labyrinth fish]] have developed a special organ that allows them to take advantage of the oxygen of the air, but is not a true  lung. Fish use the process known as countercurrent flow, in which water and blood flow in opposite directions across the gills, maximizing the diffusion of oxygen.

===Molluscs===
{{see also|Respiratory system of gastropods}}

[[Molluscs]] generally possess gills that allow exchange of oxygen from an aqueous environment into the circulatory system. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood which contains hemocyaninine as its oxygen-capturing molecule. Therefore, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The [[respiratory system of gastropods]] can include either gills or a lung.

===Arthropods===
{{see also|Gill#Invertebrate gills}}

Aquatic [[arthropod]]s generally possess some form of gills in which gas exchange takes place by diffusing through the [[exoskeleton]]. Others may breathe atmospheric air while remaining submerged, via breathing tubes or trapped air bubbles, though some [[aquatic insect]]s may remain submerged indefinitely and respire using a [[Plastron (arthropod)|plastron]]. A very few [[Arachnid]]s have adopted an aquatic life style including the [[Diving bell spider]]. In all cases, oxygen is provided from air trapped by hairs around the animals body. 

===Aquatic reptiles===
All aquatic reptiles breathe air into lungs. The [[anatomy|anatomical structure]] of the [[lungs]] is less complex in [[reptiles]] than in [[mammals]], with reptiles lacking the very extensive  airway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. [[Gas exchange]] in reptiles still occurs in [[alveoli]] however, reptiles do not possess a [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. Thus, breathing occurs via a change in the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of [[intercostal muscle]]s in all reptiles except [[turtle]]s. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs [[inhalation|inspiration]] or [[Exhalation|expiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498684/reptile/38473/Respiratory-system|title=reptile - animal|publisher=|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Reptiles#Respiration|reptiles]] for more detailed descriptions of the respiratory system in these animals.

===Amphibians===
{{see also|Amphibian#Respiratory system}}

Both the lungs and the [[Frog#Morphology and physiology|skin]] serve as respiratory organs in [[amphibians]]. The skin of these animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of [[mucus]] from specialized cells. While the lungs are of primary importance to breathing control, the skin's unique properties aid rapid gas exchange when amphibians are submerged in oxygen-rich water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Aquatic birds===
The respiratory system of birds differs significantly from that found in mammals, containing unique anatomical features such as [[air sacs]]. The lungs of birds also do not have the capacity to inflate as birds lack a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and a [[pleural cavity]]. Gas exchange in birds occurs between air capillaries and [[capillary|blood capillaries]], rather than in [[alveoli]]. See [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|Avian respiratory system]] for a detailed description of these and other features.

==Gills==
[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|right|Posterior view of the gills of a [[tuna]]]]

Many aquatic animals have developed [[gill]]s for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] which are specifically adapted to their function. In fish, for example, they have:
*A large [[surface area]] to allow as much [[oxygen]] to enter the gills as possible because more of the gas comes into contact with the [[Biological membrane|membrane]]
*Good [[Blood circulation|blood supply]] to maintain the concentration gradient needed
*Thin membrane to allow for a short diffusion pathway
*each gill arch has two rows (hemibranchs) of [[gill filament]]s
*each gill filament has many [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e
In [[osteichthyes]], the gills contain 4 [[gill arch]]es on each side of the head, two on each side for [[chondrichthyes]] or 7 gill baskets on each side of the fish's head in [[Lampreys]].
In fish, the long bony cover for the gill (the [[operculum (fish)|operculum]]) can be used for pushing water. Some fish pump water using the operculum.  Without an operculum, other methods, such as ram [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]], are required. Some species of [[shark]]s use this system.  When they swim, water flows into the mouth and across the gills.  Because these sharks rely on this technique, they must keep swimming in order to respire.

Bony fish use [[Countercurrent exchange|countercurrent flow]] to maximize the intake of oxygen that can [[Diffusion|diffuse]] through the gill.  Countercurrent flow occurs when deoxygenated blood moves through the gill in one direction while oxygenated water moves through the gill in the opposite direction. This mechanism maintains the [[concentration gradient]] thus increasing the efficiency of the respiration process as well and prevents the oxygen levels from reaching an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. Cartilaginous fish do not have a countercurrent flow system as they lack bones which are needed to have the opened out gill that bony fish have.

==Control of respiration==
Scientists have investigated what part of the body is responsible for maintaining the respiratory rhythm. They found that [[neuron]]s located in the 
[[brainstem]] of fish are responsible for the genesis of the respiratory rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=David F.|title=Respiratory pattern generation in adult lampreys (Lampetra fluviatilis): interneurons and burst resetting|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|date=1986|volume=158|issue=1|pages=91–102|doi=10.1007/BF00614523|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00614523}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The position of these neurons is slightly different from the centers of respiratory genesis in mammals but they are located in the same brain compartment, which has caused debates about the [[homology (biology)|homology]] of respiratory centers between aquatic and terrestrial species. In both aquatic and terrestrial respiration, the exact mechanisms by which neurons can generate this involuntary rhythm are still not completely understood (see [[Involuntary control of respiration]]).

Another important feature of the respiratory rhythm is that it is modulated to adapt to the oxygen consumption of the body. As observed in mammals, fish “breathe” faster and heavier when they do [[exercise|physical exercise]]. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have been strongly debated over more than 100 years between scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=Tony G.|author2=Gary A. Iwamoto|author3=Philippe Haouzi|title=Point:Counterpoint: Supraspinal locomotor centers do/do not contribute significantly to the hyperpnea of dynamic exercise|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=10 November 2005|volume=100|issue=3|pages=1077–1083|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01528.2005|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/100/3/1077.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors can be classified in 2 schools:

1. Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes are pre-programmed in the brain, which would imply that neurons from [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] centers of the brain connect to [[respiratory center]]s in anticipation of movements.

2. Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes result from the detection of muscle contraction, and that respiration is adapted as a consequence of muscular contraction and oxygen consumption. This would imply that the brain possesses some kind of detection mechanisms that would trigger a respiratory response when muscular contraction occurs.

Many now agree that both mechanisms are probably present and complementary, or working alongside a mechanism that can detect changes in oxygen and/or carbon dioxide blood saturation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10670">'''Astronomical chronology''', or '''astronomical dating''', is a technical method of dating events or artifacts that are associated with astronomical phenomena.  Written records of historical events that include descriptions of astronomical phenomena have done much to clarify the chronology of the [[Ancient Near East]]; works of art which depict the configuration of the stars and planets and buildings which are oriented to the rising and setting of celestial bodies at a particular time have all been dated through astronomical calculations.

==Dating historical events==

The use of descriptions of astronomical phenomena to date historical events began in the 16th century, a time of a renewed humanistic interest in history and of increasingly precise astronomical tables.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "Some Uses of Eclipses in Early Modern Chronology," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 64 (2003): 213-229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eclipse]]s in particular are relatively infrequent events and can be dated precisely.  When the circumstances are not exact and descriptions leave ambiguities, one can often use other details such as the month of the eclipse or the position of other stars and planets to identify the specific eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. R. Stephenson]] and J. M. Steele, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006JHA....37...55S "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175"], ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical dating, like other forms of historical interpretation, requires care in interpreting the surviving written records.  John Steele has proposed three questions that must be asked when dating an event:  Does the record refer to an actual astronomical event, or is this merely a modern assumption?  If it does refer to an actual astronomical event, is the source reliable?  Can the record provide an unambiguous date without making unwarranted assumptions about ancient astronomical observational methods?&lt;ref&gt;John M. Steele, "The Use and Abuse of Astronomy in Establishing Ancient Chronologies," ''Physics in Canada/La Physique au Canada'', 59 (2003): 243-8, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] provide detailed and unambiguous accounts of the positions of all the visible planets, often in relation to specific stars, that have been used to provide precise dates of events like the defeat of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] by [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] on 1 October 331 BCE and of Alexander's subsequent death on 11 June 323.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jona Lendering]], [http://www.pothos.org/content/index.php?page=astronomical-diaries "Astronomical Diaries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514150612/http://www.pothos.org/content/index.php?page=astronomical-diaries |date=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the success of this method depends on the reliability of the written sources and the precision of their accounts of astronomical phenomena, attempts to date literary texts which may describe astronomical events loosely or even as metaphors have led researchers to conclusions that appear precise, but rely on invalid assumptions and are consequently less widely accepted.  Thus the attempts to date [[Vedas|Vedic texts]] describing the [[Pleiades]] as rising "due East" to about 2300 BCE, which is the time when the Pleiades rose "exactly" due East, is complicated by the fact that poetic descriptions need not be taken as reflecting precise astronomical observations, while [[Axial precession|precession]] is a very slow process which makes only small changes in the azimuth of a star rising in the East.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Witzel]], "The Pleiades and the Bears viewed from inside the Vedic texts," [http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0502/ejvs0502.txt ''Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320070909/http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0502/ejvs0502.txt |date=March 20, 2008 }}, 5 (1999), issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating artifacts==

[[File:Aratea 93v.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Ninth century diagram of the positions of the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] on 18 March 816.]]
Among the artifacts that can most readily be dated by astronomical techniques are depictions of the positions of the [[celestial bodies]] at a particular time.  Since the motions of the celestial bodies are all at different periods, it takes many centuries for all the planets plus the Sun and the Moon, to reach the same positions in the signs of the [[Zodiac]].  For a configuration accurate to ±15° (that is, within a single [[Zodiac#Western zodiac|sign]]) the positions of these seven bodies will only return to the same configuration once in about 3700 years.  A particular case involved a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]] which portrayed the position of these seven celestial bodies on 18 March 816; corresponding to the period when the manuscript was written. This calculation demonstrated that this illustration was not a copy of an earlier classical depiction of the position of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mostert and Marco Mostert, "Using astronomy as an aid to dating manuscripts, The example of the [[Leiden Aratea]] planetarium", ''[[Quaerendo]]'', 20 (1999): 248-261; see esp. § 6. Reliability of the Dating Method, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapidly moving Moon is the most sensitive indicator for the exact time; if one can estimate the indicated position of the Moon to within a degree, the time of the diagram can be computed to within an hour.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Stahlman, "Astronomical Dating Applied to a Type of Astrological Illustration," ''Isis'', 47 (1956): 154-160, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

A striking example of this method was an astrological portrait of Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (1540–1591), which depicted the positions of the seven classical planets in the zodiac and noted the computed positions of the planets to the nearest minute of arc.  Here the largest source of error in the date was the uncertainty of 16th-century astronomical calculations.  The resulting time was about noon of 12 December 1581.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Beer, "Astronomical dating of works of art", ''Vistas in Astronomy'', 9 (1967): 177-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating structures by their orientation==

A more controversial [[Archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] approach has been used to date structures that are believed to have been oriented on astronomical principles by measuring their orientation and computing the date in the past when a single specified celestial body, whether the Sun or a selected star, rises or sets at the measured azimuth.  The astronomer, [[Norman Lockyer]], applied this method to [[Stonehenge]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lockyer and  F. C. Penrose, "An Attempt to Ascertain the Date of the Original Construction of Stonehenge from Its Orientation", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', 69. (1901 - 1902): 137-147.&lt;/ref&gt; by measuring the orientation of the Stonehenge avenue and comparing it to the position of solstitial sunrise, which changes slowly due to the changing [[obliquity of the ecliptic]]. The archaeologist, F. C. Penrose, applied a similar method to ancient Greek Temples, attempting to establish their dates by relating their orientation to the appearance of stars on the horizon, the position of which changes slowly due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;F. C. Penrose, "On the Results of an Examination of the Orientations of a Number of Greek Temples with a View to Connect these Angles with the Amplitudes of Certain Stars at the Time the Temples were Founded, and an Endeavour to Derive therefrom the Dates of their Foundation by Consideration of the Changes Produced upon the Right Ascension and Declination of the Stars by the Precession of the Equinoxes", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', A, 184 (1893): 805-834.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide variance of these dates from historically accepted ones led the architect and archaeologist, [[William Bell Dinsmoor]], to mistrust dates established by the slowly changing obliquity of the ecliptic or by stellar alignments, which involve an arbitrary selection of a star that rises on the proper azimuth.  Instead he proposed a method employing what was already known from historical records concerning the dates of construction of Greek temples, the festivals associated with specific temples, and the nature of the Greek [[Lunisolar calendar]].  Since the date of a festival in the Greek lunisolar calendar only recurs on the same date in the solar calendar every eight or nineteen years, Dinsmoor identified a festival connected with a specific temple and was able to determine the exact year near the historically recorded construction date when the Sun rose in alignment with the temple on the date of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;William Bell Dinsmoor, "Archæology and Astronomy", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 10 (1939): 95-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Beyond This Horizon''''' is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]]. It was originally published as a two-part serial in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' (April, May 1942, under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald) and then as a single volume by [[Fantasy Press]] in 1948. It was awarded a [[Retro Hugo]] award for best novel in 2018.&lt;ref name="Hugo43"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1943-retro-hugo-awards/ |title=1943 Retro Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The novel depicts a world where genetic selection for increased health, longevity, and intelligence has become so widespread that the unmodified '[[control group|control naturals]]' are a carefully managed and protected minority. [[Duel]]ing and the carrying of arms are socially accepted ways of maintaining civility in public; a man can wear distinctive clothing to show his unwillingness to duel, but this results in an inferior social status. The world has become an economic [[utopia]]; the "economic dividend" is so high that [[Post scarcity|work has become optional]]. The chief economic problem is in fact using up the economic surplus: many high-quality goods actually cost ''less'' than those of lower quality. Many people use lower-quality goods as status symbols. The government invests heavily in scientific research, but this has the side effect of further increasing productivity a decade or more later, so long-term projects with no expected economic return are favored above anything but medical research, on the theory that longer lifespans will consume more surplus.

The story's protagonist, Hamilton Felix (surname first), is the archetypal [[superman|übermensch]]. Felix is the penultimate step in a "star line" designed to breed for the highest-quality human characteristics. However, he lacks [[eidetic memory]], which disqualifies him for what many consider to be humanity's most important occupation: that of an "encyclopedic synthesist", one who analyzes the sum total of human knowledge for untapped potential. As such, he finds his life—and the society he lives in—to be enjoyable but meaningless. However, when one of these synthesists seeks him out, inquiring when he plans to continue his line, he finds himself drawn into an adventure which not only gives him purpose but convinces him that his society is worth saving after all.

Major themes in the novel are reincarnation, the immortality of the soul, and telepathy. Hamilton Felix is the product of generations of [[genetic engineering]]. He is almost but not quite the perfect human. In the second half of the book his genetically engineered son is born. The son is the climax of generations of genetic engineering and selective breeding, and is a genetically perfect human. As the son grows he begins to develop almost superhuman mental abilities and a surprising telepathic ability. As the novel draws to a close, it becomes apparent that the son senses that Hamiton Felix's second child, a daughter, is the reincarnation of a wise elderly government official who foresaw her own death and arranged to die shortly before Felix's daughter was born. This official understood that the soul is reincarnated, and in preparation for her own death and reincarnation she was instrumental in the genetic engineering of the son and daughter.

==Reception==
[[Anthony Boucher]] and [[J. Francis McComas]] characterized ''Beyond This Horizon'' as among "the finest science fiction novels of the modern crop."&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading", ''[[F&amp;SF]]'', October 1951, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; [[P. Schuyler Miller]] reviewed the novel favorably, saying "in true Heinlein manner the basic theme of the book smashes the screen of action only in the closing pages."&lt;ref&gt;"Book Reviews", ''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'', February 1949, p.146&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
In the Japanese visual novel ''[[Eden*]]'', the term 'Felix' is used in the setting to refer to genetically engineered humans with abilities similar to those described in the book, and the connection to Heinlein's work is referred to in dialogue.

[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1952win n7.jpg|thumb|right|''Beyond This Horizon'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1952, appearing under the "Anson McDonald" byline even though the book edition had been published under Heinlein's own name four years earlier]]

'''Universidad Autónoma Chapingo''' (Chapingo Autonomous University) is an agricultural college located in [[Texcoco, Mexico State]] in Mexico. The university is a federally funded public institution of higher education. It offers technical and full bachelor's degrees as well as having scientific and technological research programs. Many of these programs are related to agriculture, forestry and fishing.&lt;ref name="uach"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=universidad |title=Rectoría |publisher=Universidad Autonoma de Chapingo |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109102242/http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=universidad |archivedate=2010-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school began as the Escuela Nacional de Agricultura (National School of Agriculture) which was founded in 1854 at the Monastery of San Jacinto in Mexico City. The school was moved in 1923 to the President [[Álvaro Obregón]]&lt;ref name="historiauac"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=historia |title=Historia |publisher=Universidad Autonoma de Chapingo |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906131307/http://portal.chapingo.mx/rectoria/?modulo=historia |archivedate=2009-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="novo140"&gt;{{cite book |title= The State of Mexico |last=Novo |first=Gerardo |author2=Jorge de la Luz |year=2002 |publisher= Ediciones Nueva Guia SA de CV |location= Madrid |isbn=968-5437-26-2  |page=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ex Hacienda of Chapingo.  Postgraduate studies were added in 1959. The school received autonomous status in 1978. It offers courses of study in Forestry, Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Industries, Irrigation, Rural Sociology and more.&lt;ref name="historiauac"/&gt;

The main attraction for visitors at this school is its murals. In the old hacienda chapel, which is now the University Ceremonies Room is a mural by [[Diego Rivera]] called “Tierra Fecundada” (Fertile Land). This work was begun in 1924 and completed in 1927. Covering an area of over 700m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the work divides into three parts. The left panel depicts man’s struggle to have land, the right panel shows the evolution of Mother Nature and the center shows the communion between man and earth. It is considered to be one of Rivera’s best works.&lt;ref name="novo140"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atractivos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texcoco.gob.mx/ciudad_atractivos_culturales_economicos |title=Ciudad / Atractivos turísticos y culturales |publisher=Municipality of Texcoco |location=Texcoco, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=City: Tourist and cultural attractions |accessdate=2010-02-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100103015303/http://www.texcoco.gob.mx/ciudad_atractivos_culturales_economicos |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the school acquired an unnamed mural by [[Luis Nishizawa]]. This work was produced during his last year at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas (ENAP) of [[UNAM]] and depicts the agriculture of Mexico in both the past and the present. The work is six meters high, nine meters wide and in the form of a triangle. It is placed in a building that is commonly called “El Partenon.”&lt;ref name="lvalos"&gt;{{cite news |title= Llevan mural a Chapingo |first= Leopoldo |last=Avalos |newspaper=Reforma  |location= Mexico City  |date=2006-02-16 |page= 14 |language=Spanish |trans-title= Bringing mural to Chapingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The school is also home to the '''National Museum of Agriculture'''. The 2,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; facility presents the development of agriculture in Mexico from the pre-Hispanic past to the present day. The collection has about 4,000 objects relating to technology, agronomy including farming implements and photographs by Hanz Gutmann.&lt;ref name="musnatag"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/2842-Museo-Nacional-de-Agricultura-de-la-Universidad-Aut%F3noma-de-Chapingo-%28Estado-de-M%E9xico%29 |title=Museo Nacional de Agricultura de la Universidad Autónoma de Chapingo (Estado de México) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=The National Museum of Agriculture of the Autonomous University of Chapingo |accessdate=2010-02-16 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circuit Scribe''' is a ball-point pen containing silver [[conductive ink]] one can use to draw [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]s instantly on flexible [[substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s like paper. Circuit Scribe made its way onto [[Kickstarter]] (an online site where people can fund projects) on November 19, 2013 with its goal of raising $85,000 for the manufacturing of the first batch of pens. By December 31, 2013, Circuit Scribe was able to raise a total of $674,425 with 12,277 'backers' or donors.&lt;ref name=kickstarter&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit Scribe: Draw Circuits Instantly|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/electroninks/circuit-scribe-draw-circuits-instantly|website=Kickstarter|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to drawing a picture, users can use a Circuit Scribe pen to draw lines on a simple piece of paper. They can then attach special electrical components on the drawn lines which allows the electrical currents to run through the components. This replaces the use of breadboards and wires.

== Development ==
A team of researchers in [[Electroninks Incorporated]], a startup company located at [[Research Park]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], created a water-based, non-toxic conductive ink that was noted as the Invention of the Month by [[Popular Science]].&lt;ref name=popsci&gt;{{cite web|title=Invention of the Month: Conductive Ink|url=http://www.popsci.com/diy/article/2012-03/invention-month-conductive-ink|website=Popular Science|publisher=Bonnier Corporation Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team began by developing a prototype using pens from a different company and replacing the ink with their special silver ink. Once completed, they started a Kickstarter campaign to earn funding for a mass production of the final form of the pens.

=== Team ===
The researching team consists of S. Brett Walker, [[Jennifer A. Lewis]], Michael Bell, Analisa Russo, and Nancy Beardsly.&lt;ref name=team&gt;{{cite web|title=The Team|url=http://www.electroninks.com/about/|website=Electroninks|publisher=Electroninks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker is the CEO of Electroninks and the co-founder along with Lewis, Bell, and the director of product development, Russo. Bell is also the chief operating officer while Beardsley is the technical support and user experience.

=== Prototype ===
The prototype pens are hand-cleaned [[Sakura Color Products Corporation|Sakura]] [[Gel pen|Gelly Roll Metallic]] pens. The ink is replaced with the researchers' silver conductive ink. In order to have the right amount of ink flow to make smooth lines, the ink is precisely tuned.

=== Ink ===
The ink is created by placing an aqueous solution of silver nitrate into a flask of water combined with [[polyacrylic acid]] (PAA) and [[diethanolamine]] (DEA), the capping agent and reducing agent, respectively. After about twenty hours, the silver nitrate is dissolved, forming particles with a diameter of about 5 nanometers. In order to enlarge the size of the particle to an average diameter of about 400 nanometers, the flask is placed on a heated [[sonicator]], a device that produces high-intensity ultrasound. Once cooled, the solution is poured into a larger flask and the thick [[precipitate]], an insoluble solid which is formed is scraped out. From there, [[ethanol]] is added to [[coagulate]] the particles, or change the particles to a solid state. Most of the [[supernatant]], the liquid lying above a layer of the precipitate, is then poured out so the remaining liquid can be [[centrifuged]], or separated. After the process of centrifugation, the particles are placed back in water and forced through a syringe filter to remove unnecessary particles in the solution. Next, [[hydroxyethyl cellulose]] (HEC) is added as a [[binder (material)|binder]] and the entire mixture is [[homogenized]]. The solvents are allowed to evaporate until the ink has a desired viscosity or thickness.&lt;ref name=popsci/&gt;

Once the ink is created, a roller ball pen is dismantled and cleaned so the ink can be placed inside using a flat tip [[spatula]]. After replacing the roller ball tip, a couple blasts of compressed air is shot from the back end to force the ink into the tip. The outer cover of the pen is replaced and the prototype of the Circuit Scribe is created. From there, the team launched its Kickstarter campaign.

=== Kickstarter Campaign ===
Circuit Scribe launched its campaign on Kickstarter to receive funding and included a list of pledges which people could donate a certain amount and get a corresponding gift:&lt;ref name=kickstarter/&gt;

* $1,000,000: Resistor Pen

== Modules ==
Circuit Scribe can be used to draw circuits that connect different types of modules, or individual components, such as:&lt;ref name=modules&gt;{{cite web|title=Circuit Scribe|url=https://123d.circuits.io/shop/circuitscribe#modules|website=123D Circuits|publisher=Autodesk, Inc|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power ===
* USB Power Adapter: Allows user to power the drawn circuits with either a USB port or a wall outlet.
* [[9V Battery]] Adapter: Supplies a nine-volt power to the circuits.

=== Input ===
* [[Switch|SPST Switch]]: An on/off switch that allows users to control the electrical circuit.
* [[Switch|DPDT Switch]]: Two switches that direct the flow of current through the circuit.
* [[Light Sensor]]: Shines light on the phototransistor to control an output.
* [[Potentiometer]] 10k Ohm: A knob that controls the dimness, volume, and speed of circuit.

=== Connect ===
* 2-Pin Adapter: Allows user to connect resistors, capacitors, or sensors to circuits.
* [[Bipolar junction transistor|NPN Transistor]]: An electrical amplifier that converts small signals into large currents.
* Blinker: Blinks output components on and off at adjustable rates.
* DIY Boards: Allows user to solder 2, 4, 6, or 8 pin components to the board.
* [[Electrical connector|Connector Cables]]: Connects the paper circuit to DIY hardware platform.

=== Output ===
* [[Light-emitting diode|Bi-LED]]: Two LEDs in one that can flip directions to change the color. 
* Buzzer: Vibrates in response to the voltage.
* [[Electric motor|Motor]]: Rotates with an applied voltage.
* [[RGB LED]]: A red, blue, and green LED.

== Uses ==
The Circuit Scribe allows the user to draw electrical circuits in any shape with its silver ink. With this aspect and its ability to connect different types of modules, it is possible to produce simple designs like an [[Arduino]], an open-source electronic platform based on hardware and software.

=== Arduino ===
Circuit Scribe allows users to create a paper Arduino (or a ‘paperduino’), which is demonstrated by the research team. The team first found the schematics on the Arduino website and modified them so that they would work on a [[pen plotter]].&lt;ref name=arduino&gt;{{cite web|title=Paperduino 2.0 with Circuit Scribe|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Paperduino-20-with-Circuit-Scribe/|website=Instructables|publisher=Autodesk, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a few modifications, they arranged the components and traces so that the board could be printed in a single layer. The alignments are set to 0.6 millimeters to match the width of the pen traces with a minimum distance of 0.1 millimeters. The pen plotter only prints lines and does not fill the patterns, so they designed large pads out of concentric circles and built up the pads for the components with some extra line features. This allows for a stronger conductivity. It is important to put chips close together to minimize the line resistance between them, but not so close that it's difficult to place the components. They used components from the 1206 package which are a bit larger than the original components from the Arduino. Before exporting the layout, they deselected every layer of the file except the top layer of traces. After exporting the file in .dxf format, both the wire width and the fill area options were deselected and the files were saved. Finally, the team measured the size of the board layout and dragged it onto a new sheet on [[Silhouette Studio]]. From there, the vertical height was adjusted to 2.945 inches and the speed was set to 1 in order to lay down the most amount of ink when printed. The team went on to place components like resistors, capacitors, and LEDs on the printed silver ink. Components can be attached using tweezers and super glue, but can be reinforced using conductive epoxy.

== Extras ==

=== Resistor Pen ===
As posted on their Kickstarter campaign, the creators of Circuit Scribe planned to develop resistor pens one can use to draw [[resistors]] the way one can use the Circuit Scribe to draw circuits. Although their stretch goal of $1,000,000 was not met by the deadline on the campaign, the team still managed to create them.

[[File:Claremont Colleges Collage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Clockwise from top: Pomona College, Keck Graduate Institute, the Honnold-Mudd Library, Pitzer College, Scripps College, Harvey Mudd College, Claremont McKenna College.]]

The '''Claremont Colleges''' (known colloquially as the '''7Cs''') are an American [[consortium]] of seven highly selective institutions of higher education located in [[Claremont, California]], a city {{convert|35|mi}} east of downtown [[Los Angeles]]. They comprise five undergraduate colleges (the '''5Cs''') — [[Pomona College]], [[Scripps College]], [[Claremont McKenna College]] (CMC), [[Harvey Mudd College]], and [[Pitzer College]] — and two graduate schools — [[Claremont Graduate University]] (CGU) and [[Keck Graduate Institute]] (KGI). All of the members except KGI have adjoining campuses that together cover roughly {{convert|1|mi2|km2}}.

The consortium was founded in 1925 by Pomona president [[James A. Blaisdell]], who proposed a [[collegiate university]] design inspired by [[Oxford University]]. He sought to provide the specialization, flexibility, and personal attention commonly found in small colleges, but with the resources of a large university.&lt;ref&gt;[[James A. Blaisdell]], the creator of the Claremont Colleges, declared in 1923 "My own very deep hope is that instead of one great, undifferentiated university, we might have a group of institutions divided into small colleges—somewhat of an [[Oxford University|Oxford]] type—around a [[library]] and other utilities which they would use in common. In this way, I should hope to preserve the inestimable personal values of the small college, while securing the facilities of the great university."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the consortium has roughly 7700 students and 3600 faculty and staff, and offers more than 2000 courses every semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Claremont Colleges |url=http://www.claremont.edu/ |accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colleges share a central library, campus safety services, and other resources. Among the undergraduate schools, there is significant social interaction and academic cross-registration, but each college still maintains a distinct identity. For the Class of 2020 admissions cycle, four of the five most selective liberal art colleges in the U.S. by acceptance rate were among the Claremont Colleges, and the remaining college, Scripps, had the second lowest acceptance rate among women's colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toptieradmissions.com/resources/college-admissions-statistics/ivy-league-admission-statistics-for-class-of-2020/|title=Ivy League Admissions Stats &amp; Acceptance Rates, Class of 2020|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fiske Guide to Colleges has called the consortium "a collection of intellectual resources unmatched in America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/aboutcuc/|title=About CUC|work=claremont.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgu.edu/pages/7234.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813201211/http://www.cgu.edu/pages/7234.asp |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }} The Claremont Difference&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colleges ==

The five undergraduate colleges are:
* [[Pomona College]] (founded 1887), a small, [[coeducational]], [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] that offers majors in humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Pomona College is the founding member of the Claremont Colleges.
* [[Scripps College]] (founded 1926), a small, [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts]], [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's college]], which offers 35 majors in both the sciences and humanities.
* [[Claremont McKenna College]] (founded 1946), a small, [[coeducational]], [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] that specializes in [[economics]], [[political science]], [[international relations]], and [[Policy|public policy]]. It also maintains a  broad set of majors in the [[natural sciences]], [[social sciences]], and [[humanities]]. Claremont McKenna College is also home to the [[The Robert Day School|Robert Day School of Economics and Finance]], which offers both an undergraduate program and a master's program in finance.
* [[Harvey Mudd College]] (founded 1955), a small, [[coeducational]] college specializing in [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], and the [[physical science|physical]] and [[biological science]]s but also includes coursework in the humanities and social sciences.
* [[Pitzer College]] (founded 1963), a small, [[coeducational]], [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] noted for its core values of Social Responsibility, Intercultural Understanding, Interdisciplinary Learning, Student Engagement and Environmental Sustainability. Pitzer is part of the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States#SAT optional movement|SAT optional movement]] among liberal arts colleges.

The two graduate universities are:
* [[Claremont Graduate University]] (founded 1925), awards master's and doctoral degrees in 31 disciplines: [[arts]], [[humanities]], [[social sciences]], [[Behavioural sciences|behavioral]] &amp; [[Organizational studies|organizational sciences]], [[management]]/[[Senior management|executive management]], [[psychology]], [[Education|educational studies]], [[religion]], [[mathematical sciences]], [[information systems]] &amp; [[Information technology|technology]], [[Community health|community]] &amp; [[global health]], and [[botany]].
* [[Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences]] (founded 1997), a [[Medical research|biomedical]] [[graduate school]] offers professional Master of [[Biotechnology|Bioscience]] (MBS) degree and PhD in Applied Life Science for MBS graduates. It also offers a Postdoctoral Professional Masters (PPM) and a joint PhD program in [[computational biology]] with Claremont Graduate University.  The Keck Graduate Institute School of Pharmacy opened in 2014 offering a four-year Doctorate of Pharmacy degree (Pharm.D.). Keck Graduate Institute also sponsors a four-year undergraduate program in collaboration with the [[Minerva Project]], termed [[Minerva Schools at KGI]], though students are not physically present on the Claremont Colleges campuses.

The [[Claremont School of Theology]] (founded 1885) (and thus [[Claremont Lincoln University]]) is affiliated with the consortium, but is not a member.

== Rankings ==

According to the [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|American Liberal Arts College]] rankings released by ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' in fall 2017, the "5Cs" were ranked among the top 40 liberal art colleges in the United States: Pomona College (#6), Claremont McKenna College (#8), Harvey Mudd College (#12), Scripps College (#26), and Pitzer College (#33). Additionally, all of the undergraduate colleges are categorized as "Most Selective".&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-liberal-arts-colleges/spp+50 National Liberal Arts College Rankings] U.S.News &amp; World Report, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked the 5C's among the top 60 undergraduate colleges (including universities and military academies) in the nation and within the top 25 liberal arts colleges for its 2017 report: Pomona College (#10 overall, #1 LAC), Claremont McKenna College (#11 overall, #2 LAC), Harvey Mudd College (#18 overall, #5 LAC), Scripps College (#43 overall, #16 LAC), and Pitzer College (#59 overall, #23 LAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 25 Liberal Arts Colleges 2017|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickfederle/2017/08/02/top-25-liberal-arts-colleges-2017/#71eb29da6bc7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niche listed all of the undergraduate colleges within the top 30 small colleges in the United States as measured by surveys rating various components of the undergraduate experience: Pomona College (#2), Harvey Mudd College (#5), Claremont McKenna College (#10), Scripps College (#22), and Pitzer College (#29).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Best Small Colleges in America|url=https://www.niche.com/colleges/search/best-small-colleges/|publisher=Niche}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' also releases individual graduate program rankings for the [[Claremont Graduate University]], with several of its programs ranking in the top tier of graduate programs nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/claremont-graduate-university-112251/overall-rankings] ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shared facilities, programs, and resources ==
Each college is independent in that, for example, students receive their degrees from the one college in which they are enrolled, and administration and admissions departments are independent. The seven-institution Claremont Colleges system is supported by The Claremont Colleges Services (TCCS), which provides centralized services, such as a library, student health, financial and human resources, telecommunications, risk management, real estate, physical plant maintenance, and other services, for those colleges.

Shared facilities include the Libraries of the Claremont Colleges, Campus Safety, the Tranquada Student Services Center (which houses Baxter Medical Center, Monsour Counseling Center, and the Health Education Outreach), McAlister Center (home of the Office of the Chaplains and the Claremont Card Center), EmPOWER Center (which works to address sexual violence), the Rick and Susan Sontag Center for Collaborative Creativity (The Hive), the Huntley Bookstore, all dining facilities, and several sports facilities. The Claremont Colleges Library is an example of the level of cooperation in terms of support services. The size of the library collection ranks third among the private institutions in [[California]], behind only [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[University of Southern California|USC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/aboutcuc/history.asp|title=History of The Claremont Colleges|work=claremont.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shared academic departments include the Intercollegiate [[Women's Studies]] Center, the Intercollegiate Department of [[Chicano]] Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of [[Asian American]] Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of Black Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of Religious Studies, the Intercollegiate Department of [[Media Studies]], and the Five-College Theater Department.

Shared intercollegiate programs include the [[European Union]] Center of California, the Chicano/[[Latino]] Student Affairs Center, the Office of Black Student Affairs, the Office of the Chaplains, Hillel, and the Queer Resource Center.

In addition, three of the Claremont Colleges&amp;mdash;Claremont McKenna College, Pitzer College, and Scripps College&amp;mdash;share a single science program. These three colleges pool their resources to create the largest academic department in Claremont, the Joint Science Department. Many research projects and courses utilize the [[Robert J. Bernard Field Station]], an {{convert|86|acre|ha|adj=on}} natural area which consists principally of the rare Coastal Sage Scrub [[ecosystem]].

Many clubs are open to students from all the undergraduate colleges. ''[[The Student Life]]'', the largest student newspaper at the 5C's, covers all five schools and publishes a weekly print edition as well as online content. [[KSPC]] 88.7 FM is the non-profit [[community radio]] station associated with the Claremont Colleges. Students from the colleges host KSPC shows and help run the station.

==History==
{{Expand section|date=October 2018|small=no}}
In October 1923, President [[James A. Blaisdell]] of Pomona College wrote to [[Ellen Browning Scripps]] describing a vision of educational excellence he had for the future Claremont Colleges:

{{quote|I cannot but believe that we shall need here in the South [of California] a suburban educational institution of the range of [[Stanford University|Stanford]]. My own very deep hope is that instead of one great undifferentiated university, we might have a group of institutions divided into small colleges — somewhat on the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] type — around a library and other utilities which they would use in common. In this way I should hope to preserve the inestimable personal values of the small college while securing the facilities of the great university. Such a development would be a new and wonderful contribution to American education. Now the thing which would assure this future institution to Southern California is land ... It is now or never. To save the needed land for educational use seems to me to guarantee to Southern California one of the great educational institutions of America. Other hands through the centuries will carry on the project and perfect it. But never again can there come so fundamental a service as this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cuc.claremont.edu/aboutcuc/land_use_statement.asp CUC Land Use Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Bernard. An Unfinished Dream: A Chronicle of the Group Plan of the Claremont Colleges. The Castle Press. 1982. pg. 702&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Athletics ==
'''[[Claremont-Mudd-Scripps Stags and Athenas|Claremont-Mudd-Scripps]]''' athletics teams from [[Claremont McKenna College]], [[Harvey Mudd College]] and [[Scripps College]] compete as one team. Male athletic teams are called the Stags, and women's teams are called the Athenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.prestosports.com/quick_facts/|title=CMS Quick Facts|work=prestosports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Pomona College]] and [[Pitzer College]] compete together as '''[[Pomona-Pitzer]]'''. Their teams are called the Sagehens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physical-education.pomona.edu/program.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124180736/http://physical-education.pomona.edu/program.shtml |archivedate=2009-01-24 |title= 	
The Athletic Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teams participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] in the [[Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]] (SCIAC). In the Division III Final Standings for the 2016-2017 year, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps ranked 4th nationally, while Pomona-Pitzer ranked 29th; they were the top two performers in the SCIAC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016-17 Learfield Directors' Cup Division III Final Standings|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/2016-17/misc_non_event/June1FinalDIIIOverall.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club and intramural sports==
In addition to the Stags/Athenas and the Sagehens, there are several 5C club sports teams.

The [[roller hockey]] club, the Claremont Centaurs, won the Division 3 Championship of the West Coast Roller Hockey League in 2009–2010, 2010–2011, and 2011–2012.

The men's and women's [[rugby union]] both attended Division II Nationals in 2004 and 2006, and the men's team won the [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] national championship in 2010.

The women's [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] team reached Nationals in 2004, 2011, and 2013, and won the tournament in 2012, and the men's [[Ultimate Frisbee|ultimate frisbee]] were 2008 Southern California Sectional champions and 2011 Division III National champions.

Other club sports offered at the 5Cs include men's [[lacrosse (sport)|lacrosse]], [[field hockey]], crew, and cycling.

==In popular culture==
The Claremont Colleges are referenced in [[Max Brooks]]'s 2006 apocalyptic horror novel ''[[World War Z]]'', in which the students at the colleges hold off 10,000 zombies by fortifying Scripps's walled campus. Brooks is an alumnus of Pitzer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5118">'''Contextual theology''' or '''contextualizing theology''' refers to theology which has responded to the dynamics of a particular context.

== Terminology ==
The term contextualizing theology was used in [[missiology]] by [[Shoki Coe]] when he argued that the [[Henry Venn (Church Missionary Society)|Venn]]-[[Rufus Anderson|Anderson]] three-self principles were inadequate in addressing the sociopolitical context of his native Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coe|first1=Shoki|title=In Search of Renewal in Theological Education|journal=Theological Education|date=Summer 1973|volume=9|issue=4|pages=233–243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coe|first1=Shoki|title=Theological Education--a Worldwide Perspective|journal=Theological Education|date=Autumn 1974|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe would popularize this notion through the Theological Education Fund of the [[World Council of Churches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wheeler|first=Ray|title=The legacy of Shoki Coe|date=April 2002|journal=International Bulletin of Missionary Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it was initially understood as part of a [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] approach to theology, it has grown in currency among [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]] and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].&lt;ref name="Wu2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtITrgEACAAJ|title=One Gospel for All Nations: A Practical Approach to Biblical Contextualization|last=Wu|first=Jackson|date=April 2015|publisher=William Carey Library Publishers|isbn=978-0-87808-629-0|location=Pasadena, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bevans2002" /&gt;

An individual may come from a particular cultural [[worldview]], such as [[Arab world|Arabic]] or [[Asia]]n culture, or be faced with particular sociopolitical issues. Hence, examples of contextualized theologies include [[Latin America]]n [[liberation theology]], [[Minjung theology]], and [[African theology]].&lt;ref name="KarkkainenKyoungJae2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZHkAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|title=Asian Contextual Theology for the Third Millennium: Theology of Minjung in Fourth-Eye Formation|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-0-227-17331-2|editor-last1=Chung|editor-first1=Paul S.|location=Eugene, OR|editor-last2=Kim Kyoung-Jae|editor-first2=|editor-last3=Kärkkäinen|editor-first3=Veli-Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bergmann2017"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GXJBDgAAQBAJ|title=God in Context: A Survey of Contextual Theology|last=Bergmann|first=Sigurd|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=978-1-351-93280-6|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Systematic theology|systematic theologian]] [[Regunta Yesurathnam]] sees contextual theology as including "all that is implied in [[indigenization]] or [[inculturation]], but also seeks also to include the realities of contemporary, secularity, technology, and the struggle for human justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Van Engen  | first = Charles E.  | contribution = Toward a Contextually Appropriate Methodology in Mission Theology  | year = 2005  | title = Appropriate Christianity  | editor-last = Kraft  | editor-first = Charles H.  | page = 194  | place = Pasadena  | publisher = William Carey Library}} {{ISBN|0-87808-358-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The missiologist Stephen Bevans argues that there is no such thing as normative theology, that "doing theology contextually is not an option" since it is a human enterprise which is created within a particular human context.&lt;ref name="Bevans2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevans|first=Stephen B. |title=Models of Contextual Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ukPAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|isbn=978-1-57075-438-8|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical studies ==
In the field of [[Bible translations|Bible translation]] and [[Biblical hermeneutics|interpretation]], contextualization is the process of assigning [[Meaning (non-linguistic)|meaning]] as a means of [[Meaning (non-linguistic)#Meaning as internal interpretation|interpreting]] the environment within which a text or [[Action (philosophy)|action]] is executed.

Contextualization is used in the study of Bible translations in relation to their relevant [[cultural]] settings. Derived from the practice of [[hermeneutics]], it sought to understand the use of words borrowed into the [[Hebrew Scriptures]], and later their Greek and Latin translations.

The word continues to be used theologically, mainly in the sense of contextualizing the biblical message as perceived in the missionary mandate originated by Jesus in the [[gospel]] accounts. However, since the early 1970s, the word's meaning has widened. It is now used by [[secular]], religious and political groups to render their message into different settings by adjusting or accommodating words, phrases or meanings into understandable contexts in  [[respondent]] cultures.

'''Cottey College''' is an independent, women's liberal arts and sciences college in [[Nevada, Missouri]]. While it began as a finishing school, it is now a four-year baccalaureate-granting college. It was founded by Virginia Alice Cottey Stockard in 1884 and is currently owned and supported by the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]], a philanthropic women's organization. It is the only [[nonsectarian]] college in the United States owned and supported by women for women.&lt;ref name="Weitzel"/&gt;

Cottey has 307 enrolled students.&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt; Cottey has a student to faculty ratio of 10:1.&lt;ref name="CotteyFacts"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cottey.edu/pdf/Cottey-Facts-2017-2018.pdf|title=Cottey Fact Sheet|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some classes meet with fewer than 10 students. Faculty includes both men and women, with over 90% holding the terminal [[academic degree]] in their field.&lt;ref name="CotteyFacts"/&gt;

Cottey is situated on {{convert|66|acre|ha|1}} of land in [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]], [[Missouri]], the county seat and a rural town of 8,171 people (by the 2012 estimate). The main campus is situated on 11 city blocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/pdf/enroll/cottey_map.pdf|title=Cottey College|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five blocks south of this is B.I.L. Hill, a {{convert|33|acre|ha|1|adj=on}} wooded area owned and used by Cottey for recreation, concerts, bonfires, picnics, suite nights, and other traditions.

The official colors of Cottey are yellow and white. Additionally, the senior class color is navy blue and the freshmen class color is "baby" blue.&lt;ref name="CotteyHandbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/campus-community/student-handbook/|title=Webmaster – Cottey College, Nevada, Missouri|publisher=|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

===Residential life===
[[File:CotteyRossLibrary.jpg|thumb|Blanche Skiff Ross Memorial Library]]
Students generally represent over 40 states and 20 different countries.&lt;ref name="Weitzel"/&gt; In the 2018-19 school year, international students came from [[Angola]], [[Burundi]], [[Ethiopia]], [[France]], [[Ghana]], [[Guatemala]], [[India]], [[Jamaica]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mexico]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[South Africa]], [[ESwatini|Swaziland]], [[Uganda]], [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom,]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/home/academic/journalism/spectrum/15_1.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716195815/http://www.cottey.edu/home/academic/journalism/spectrum/15_1.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 July 2010|title=Webmaster – Cottey College, Nevada, Missouri|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cottey students live in one of three campus halls (P.E.O., Reeves, and Robertson), each having between 10 and 14 [[suite (address)|suite]]s with several bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchenette arranged around a living room. Student rooms have typical college furnishing. Suites have between 8 and 12 students. Most suites are sponsored by a P.E.O. chapter, and suite members usually receive several care packages from these P.E.O.s during the year. Sponsorship of some suites has changed over time, their names changing as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cotteyphile.com/suites/|title=Suitelife|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residence halls===
'''P.E.O. Hall''' is the oldest of the existing dormitories, and was erected in 1939. It has 10 suites, housing about 100 students. It was the first building to be paid by the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] after they acquired the college.&lt;ref&gt;"Cottey College Is the Only College In the U.S. Maintained By Women." ''Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune''. Chillicothe, MO. 15 Apr 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reeves Hall''' was built in 1949 on the site where a prior Cottey dorm, Missouri Hall, had burned down in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cotteyphile.com/missourihall/|title=Missouri Hall|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like P.E.O., it houses 10 suites and about 100 students. It is noted for having the largest basement of the three halls, and a foyer reminiscent of a classic hotel lobby.

[[File:CotteyRobertsonHall.jpg|thumb|Robertson (Robbie) Hall]]
'''Robertson Hall''' (Robbie) was the last Cottey dorm to be built, being erected in 1959. It houses 14 suites (about 150 students) as well as the college's dining facility, Raney Dining Hall and the Centennial Room. It is noted for being the only hall with air conditioning and an elevator, and for having the smallest basement.

Each hall has recreational rooms, computer suites, laundry facilities, and quiet study rooms elsewhere in each building.

Cottey has had several prior dormitories, including Rosemary Hall (est. 1903) and Missouri Hall (1928–1940).

Cottey's [[sport]]s teams are called the ''Comets'' and compete in intercollegiate [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], and [[softball]] (beginning in spring 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottey.edu/comet-athletics/|title=Cottey College|publisher=|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[cross country running|cross-country]], [[tennis]] (added in fall 2014), [[golf]], and [[Track and field|track &amp; field]].

Cottey's teams compete in Region XVI of the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] playing teams in their region, as well as teams from community colleges in eastern [[Kansas]]. In the spring of 2018, the softball team made it into the [http://www.naia.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9sreBRBAEiwARroYm9RxLPEfuQyzK24DWdjeUOuecnNU01rJVtHWCuEJPmlTHSUwt9kTpRoCDr0QAvD_BwE NAIA] and won the [[NJCAA]] Regional Championships.

===International experience===
In 2018, Cottey College took their senior class on a week-long trip to [[London, England]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Japan]] over spring break. Since then, each second year class has traveled to one of several destinations: [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], [[Rome]], or [[Florence]]. For each European destination, the cost of airfare and hotel stays have been paid by the college.  Alternative trips to destinations including [[Japan]], [[Peru]], [[Thailand]], [[Guatemala]], [[New Zealand]] may incur additional fees. In 2017, Cottey traveled to [[Italy]], [[New Zealand]], [[Thailand]] or [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cottey.edu/international-experience/ |title=International Experience |publisher=Cottey College |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginnings===
[[File:Cottey Nevada Souvenir.jpg|thumb|Cottey College, circa 1910]]
Cottey College was opened by Virginia Alice Cottey in 1884, and was originally called "Vernon Seminary."&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; After teaching at Central College in [[Lexington, Missouri|Lexington]] since 1875, Alice (as she was called) decided it was time to establish the school she'd always wanted. She had $3,000 saved, and her sisters Dora and Mary lent her nearly $3,000 of their own savings to begin her school.

Several towns bid for the opportunity to host the new girls' school, including [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]] and several towns in [[Missouri]]. After much thought, Alice accepted [[Nevada, Missouri|Nevada]]'s offer, even though it wasn't the most generous. Nevadans donated {{convert|6|acre|ha|3}} of land upon which Alice erected a three-story brick building, which came to be known as Main Hall.

Vernon Seminary opened its doors in 1884 as a primary, intermediate, and collegiate school.&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; In those early years, before educational standardization in the U.S., placement depended more upon accomplishment than age. In 1886 the school's name was officially changed to "Cottey College," and by 1932, only the college department remained.

In 1927, Alice offered the college to the [[P.E.O. Sisterhood]] on the condition that they raise a $200,000 endowment for the school (about $2.9 million in 2018 dollars).&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt;  The P.E.O.s accepted, and have since owned and operated Cottey College.

===Enrollment===
Enrollment grew from 28 to 72 students during the first year,&lt;ref name="TroeschVACS"/&gt; and by 1910 there were 250 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.damonwaring.com/genealogy/nevada/souvenir/page18.html|title=Nevada Souvenir|publisher=|accessdate=18 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216024819/http://www.damonwaring.com/genealogy/nevada/souvenir/page18.html|archivedate=16 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance dropped during the 1930s and '40s, but rose to maximum capacity of 350 by the 1970s. Cottey experienced a slow decline in enrollment during the 1990s and into the 2000s, which they are presently attempting to reverse,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.noellevitz.com/Our+Services/Recruitment/Results/Cottey+College.htm|title=Noel-Levitz partners with Cottey to increase enrollment|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522004203/https://www.noellevitz.com/Our+Services/Recruitment/Results/Cottey+College.htm|archive-date=2013-05-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they have mostly, with a present enrollment of 307.&lt;ref name="Stats"/&gt;

Equivalently, deism can also be defined as the view which posits God's existence as the cause of all things, and admits its perfection (and usually the existence of [[natural law]] and [[Divine providence|Providence]]) but rejects divine revelation or direct intervention of God in the universe by [[miracle]]s.  It also rejects [[revelation]] as a source of religious knowledge and asserts that [[reason]] and [[observation]] of the [[Nature|natural world]] are sufficient to determine the existence of a [[Creator deity|single creator]] or [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute principle]] of the [[universe]].&lt;!--

These lead to many subdivisions of modern deism, which serves as an overall category of belief.&lt;ref name="modern_deism_categories"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Universe Next Door: A Basic Worldview Catalog | author=James W.

So stark an interpretation of the relations of God and man, however, was accepted by very few Deists during the flowering of the doctrine, though their religious antagonists often attempted to force them into this difficult position.

==Overview==
{{See also|Theism}}
Deism is a [[theology|theological]] theory concerning the relationship between a creator and the natural world. Deistic viewpoints emerged during the [[scientific revolution]] of 17th-century Europe and came to exert a powerful influence during the 18th-century Enlightenment. Deism stood between the narrow dogmatism of the period and [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. Though deists rejected [[atheism]],&lt;ref name="González1984"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Justo L. González|title= The Reformation to the present day|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GWoHUb5qQccC&amp;pg=PA190|accessdate= 2010-08-14|year=  1984|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn= 978-0-06-063316-5|page= 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; they often were called "atheists" by more traditional theists.&lt;ref name="McLellandReligion1988"&gt;{{Cite book|author1= Joseph C.

Press|isbn= 978-0-88920-974-9|page= 85}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were a number of different forms in the 17th and 18th centuries. In England, deists included a range of people from anti-Christian to non-Christian theists.&lt;ref name="ForcePopkin1990"&gt;{{Cite book|author1= James E. Force|author2= Richard Henry Popkin|title= Essays on the context, nature, and influence of Isaac Newton's theology|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=modLIHCBCIoC&amp;pg=PA43|accessdate= 2010-08-14|year= 1990|publisher= Springer|isbn= 978-0-7923-0583-5|page= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For deists, human beings can know God only via reason and the observation of nature, but not by revelation or by supernatural manifestations (such as miracles) – phenomena which deists regard with caution if not [[Religious skepticism|skepticism]]. Deism is related to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] because it credits the formation of life and the universe to a higher power, using only natural processes. Deism may also include a spiritual element, involving experiences of God and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://moderndeism.com/html/deism_defined.html |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120719064712/http://moderndeism.com/html/deism_defined.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2012-07-19 |title= Deism Defined |publisher= Moderndeism.com |accessdate= 2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The words ''deism'' and ''theism'' both derive from words for "god": the former from Latin ''deus'', the latter from Greek ''theós'' (θεός).

{{quote|Prior to the 17th Century the terms ["deism" and "deist"] were used interchangeably with the terms "theism" and "theist", respectively. ... Theologians and philosophers of the 17th Century began to give a different signification to the words... Both [theists and deists] asserted belief in one supreme God, the Creator... . But the theist taught that God remained actively interested in and operative in the world which he had made, whereas the Deist maintained that God endowed the world at creation with self-sustaining and self-acting powers and then surrendered it wholly to the operation of these powers acting as second causes.&lt;ref&gt;

Perhaps the first recorded use of the term ''deist'' ({{lang-fr|déiste}}) occurs in [[Pierre Viret]]'s ''Instruction Chrétienne en la doctrine de la foi et de l'Évangile'' (Christian teaching on the doctrine of faith and the Gospel, 1564), reprinted in [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]]'s ''Dictionnaire'' (1697) entry ''Viret''. Viret, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], flagged the term as a neologism (''un mot tout nouveau''),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Viret wrote that a group of people believed in "some sort of God" like the Jews and Turks but regarded the doctrine of the evangelists and the apostles as a mere myth.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} According to him Deists wrongly misinterpreted the liberty given to them during the reform period.

In England, the term ''deist'' first appeared in [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' (1621).&lt;ref name="books.google"/&gt;

[[Lord Herbert of Cherbury]] (1583–1648) is considered the "father of English deism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174913/http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_24.html |archivedate=7 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his book ''[[De Veritate]]'' (1624) the first major statement of deism. Deism flourished in England between 1690 and 1740, at which time [[Matthew Tindal]]'s ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (1730), also called "The Deist's Bible," gained much attention. Later deism spread to France (notably through the work of [[Voltaire]]), to Germany, and to North America.

==Features==
The concept of deism covers a wide variety of positions on a wide variety of religious issues. [[Leslie Stephen|Sir Leslie Stephen]] describes the core of deism as consisting of "critical" and "constructional" elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stephen|first= Leslie|date= 1881 |title= History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century 3rd Edition 2 vols (reprinted 1949)|url= |location= London|publisher= Smith, Elder &amp; Co|page= |isbn= 978-0844614212|author-link= Leslie Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical''' elements of deist thought included:
* Rejection of religions that are based on books that claim to contain the revealed word of God.
* Rejection of religious dogma and demagogy.
* Skepticism of reports of miracles, prophecies and religious "mysteries".

'''Constructional''' elements of deist thought included:
* God exists and created the universe.
* God gave humans the ability to reason.

Individual deists varied in the critical and constructive elements they argued for. Some{{who|date= November 2018}} rejected miracles and prophecies, but still considered themselves Christians because they believed in what they felt was the pure, original form of Christianity{{spaced ndash}}that is, Christianity as it supposedly existed before it was corrupted by additions of such superstitions as miracles, prophecies, and the doctrine of the Trinity. Some deists rejected the claim of Jesus' divinity but continued to hold him in high regard as a moral teacher, a position known as [[Christian deism]], exemplified by [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s famous ''[[Jefferson Bible]]'' and Matthew Tindal's ''Christianity as Old as the Creation.'' Other, more radical deists,{{who|date= November 2018}} rejected Christianity altogether and expressed hostility toward Christianity, which they regarded as pure superstition. In return, Christian writers often charged radical deists with [[atheism]].

Note that the terms ''constructive'' and ''critical'' are used to refer to aspects of deistic thought, not sects or subtypes of deism{{spaced ndash}}it would be incorrect to classify any particular deist author as "a constructive deist" or "a critical deist". As [[Peter Gay]] notes:

{{quote|All Deists were in fact both critical and constructive Deists. All sought to destroy in order to build, and reasoned either from the absurdity of Christianity to the need for a new philosophy or from their desire for a new philosophy to the absurdity of Christianity. Each deist, to be sure, had his special competence. While one specialized in abusing priests, another specialized in rhapsodies to nature, and a third specialized in the skeptical reading of sacred documents. Yet whatever strength the movement had—and it was at times formidable—it derived that strength from a peculiar combination of critical and constructive elements.|Peter Gay, ''Deism: An Anthology'', p. 13}}
It should be noted, however, that the constructive element of deism was not unique to deism. It was the same as the [[natural theology]] that was so prevalent in all English theology in the 17th and 18th centuries. What set deists apart from their more orthodox contemporaries were their critical concerns.

{{quote|Defining the essence of English deism is a formidable task. Like ''[[priestcraft]]'', ''atheism'', and ''freethinking'', ''deism'' was one of the dirty words of the age. Deists were stigmatized{{spaced ndash}}often as atheists{{spaced ndash}}by their Christian opponents. Yet some Deists claimed to be Christian, and as Leslie Stephen argued in retrospect, the Deists shared so many fundamental rational suppositions with their orthodox opponents... that it is practically impossible to distinguish between them. But the term ''deism'' is nevertheless a meaningful one.... Too many men of letters of the time agree about the essential nature of English deism for modern scholars to ignore the simple fact that what sets the Deists apart from even their most [[latitudinarian]] Christian contemporaries is their desire to lay aside scriptural revelation as rationally incomprehensible, and thus useless, or even detrimental, to human society and to religion. While there may possibly be exceptions, ... most Deists, especially as the eighteenth century wears on, agree that revealed Scripture is nothing but a joke or "well-invented flam." About mid-century, [[John Leland (Presbyterian)|John Leland]], in his historical and analytical account of the movement [''View of the Principal Deistical Writers''], squarely states that the rejection of revealed Scripture is ''the'' characteristic element of deism, a view further codified by such authorities as [[Ephraim Chambers]] and [[Samuel Johnson]]. ... "DEISM," writes [[William Stephens (minister)|Stephens]] bluntly, "is a denial of all reveal'd Religion." |James E. Force, Introduction (1990) to'' An Account of the Growth of Deism in England ''(1696) by William Stephens}}
One of the remarkable features of deism is that the critical elements did not overpower the constructive elements. As E. Graham Waring observed,&lt;ref name="Waring1967"&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Waring|first=E. Graham |title=Deism and Natural Religion: A Source Book
 |year=1967 |pages=Introduction, p. xv
 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A strange feature of the [Deist] controversy is the apparent acceptance of all parties of the conviction of the existence of God." And Basil Willey observed:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Willey|first=Basil |title=The Eighteenth Century Background|year=1940
 |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|M. [[Paul Hazard]] has recently described the Deists of this time 'as rationalists with nostalgia for religion': men, that is, who had allowed the spirit of the age to separate them from orthodoxy, but who liked to believe that the slope they had started upon was not slippery enough to lead them to atheism.}}

===Concepts of "reason"===
According to the deists, reason gives all the information needed:
{{quote|By natural religion, I understand the belief of the existence of a God, and the sense and practice of those duties which result from the knowledge we, by our reason, have of him and his perfections; and of ourselves, and our own imperfections, and of the relationship we stand in to him, and to our fellow-creatures; so that the religion of nature takes in everything that is founded on the reason and nature of things.
|Matthew Tindal, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (II)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Waring|first=E. Graham |title=Deism and Natural Religion: A Source Book
 |year=1967 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Consequently, the deists attempted to use reason as a critical tool for exposing and rejecting what they saw as nonsense:
{{quote|I hope to make it appear that the use of reason is not so dangerous in religion as it is commonly represented ... There is nothing that men make a greater noise about than the "mysteries of the Christian religion". The divines gravely tell us "we must adore what we cannot comprehend" ... [Some] contend [that] some mysteries may be, or at least seem to be, contrary to reason, and yet received by faith. [Others contend] that no mystery is contrary to reason, but that all are "above" it. On the contrary, we hold that reason is the only foundation of all certitude ... Wherefore, we likewise maintain, according to the title of this discourse, that ''there is nothing in the Gospel contrary to reason, nor above it; and that no Christian doctrine can be properly called a mystery''.
|John Toland, ''Christianity Not Mysterious: or, a Treatise Shewing That There Is Nothing in the Gospel Contrary to Reason, Nor above It'' (1696)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Deism and Natural Religion: A Source Book'', pp. 1–12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Arguments for the existence of a god===
Some deists used the [[cosmological argument]] for the existence of God - as did [[Thomas Hobbes]] in several of his writings:

{{quote|The effects we acknowledge naturally, do include a power of their producing, before they were produced; and that power presupposeth something existent that hath such power; and the thing so existing with power to produce, if it were not eternal, must needs have been produced by somewhat before it, and that again by something else before that, till we come to an eternal, that is to say, the first power of all powers and first cause of all causes; and this is it which all men conceive by the name of God, implying eternity, incomprehensibility, and omnipotence.|Thomas Hobbes, ''Works'', vol. 4, pp. 59–60; quoted in John Orr, ''English Deism'', p. 76}}

===History of religion and the deist mission===
Most deists (see for instance [[Matthew Tindal]]'s ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' and
[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[The Age of Reason]]'') saw the religions of their day as corruptions of an original, pure religion that was simple and rational. They felt that this original pure religion had become corrupted by "priests" who had manipulated it for personal gain and for the class interests of the priesthood in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Champion|first=J.A.I.|
title=The Pillars of Priestcraft Shaken: The Church of England and its Enemies, 1660-1730|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History)}} Champion maintains that historical argument was a central component of the deists' defences of what they considered true religion.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this world view, over time priests had succeeded in encrusting the original simple, rational religion with all kinds of superstitions and "mysteries"{{spaced ndash}}irrational theological doctrines. Laymen were told by the priests that only the priests really knew what was necessary for salvation and that laymen must accept the mysteries on faith and on the priests' authority. This kept the laity baffled by the nonsensical "mysteries", confused, and dependent on the priests for information about the requirements for salvation. The priests consequently enjoyed a position of considerable power over the laity, which they strove to maintain and increase. Deists referred to this kind of manipulation of religious doctrine as "priestcraft," a highly derogatory term.  As [[Thomas Paine]] wrote:

{{quote|As priestcraft was always the enemy of knowledge, because priestcraft supports itself by keeping people in delusion and ignorance, it was consistent with its policy to make the acquisition of knowledge a real sin.| ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', Part 2, p. 129}}

Deists saw their mission as the stripping away of "priestcraft" and "mysteries" from religion, thereby restoring religion to its original, true condition{{spaced ndash}}simple and rational. In many cases, they considered true, original Christianity to be the same as this original [[natural religion]]. As Matthew Tindal put it:{{quote
|It can't be imputed to any defect in the light of nature that the pagan world ran into idolatry, but to their being entirely governed by priests, who pretended communication with their gods, and to have thence their revelations, which they imposed on the credulous as divine oracles. Whereas the business of the Christian dispensation was to destroy all those traditional revelations, and restore, free from all idolatry, the true primitive and natural religion implanted in mankind from the creation.|Matthew Tindal, ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (XIV)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waring|first=Edward Graham|title=Deism and natural religion: a source book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JHXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2013-05-16|year=1967|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co.|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One implication of this deist [[creation myth]] was that primitive societies, or societies that existed in the distant past, should have religious beliefs that are less encrusted with superstitions and closer to those of natural theology.  This position gradually became less plausible as thinkers such as [[David Hume]] began studying the [[Four Dissertations#The Natural History of Religion|natural history of religion]] and suggesting that the origins of religion lay not in reason but in the emotions, specifically the fear of the unknown.

===Freedom and necessity===
Enlightenment thinkers, under the influence of [[Newtonianism|Newtonian science]], tended to view the universe as a vast machine, created and set in motion by a creator being, that continues to operate according to natural law, without any divine intervention. This view naturally led to what was then usually called [[necessitarianism]]&lt;ref&gt;David Hartley, for example, described himself as "quite in the necessitarian scheme. See Ferg, Stephen, "Two Early Works of David Hartley", ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', vol. 19, no. 2 (April 1981), pp. 173–89.&lt;/ref&gt; (the modern term is [[determinism]]): the view that everything in the universe – including human behavior – is completely causally determined by antecedent circumstances and natural law. (See, for example, [[La Mettrie]]'s [http://www.cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/LaMettrie/Machine/ ''L'Homme machine''].) As a consequence, debates about [[Free will|freedom]] versus "necessity" were a regular feature of Enlightenment religious and philosophical discussions.

Because of their high regard for natural law and for the idea of a universe without miracles, deists were especially susceptible to the temptations of determinism. Reflecting the intellectual climate of the time, there were differences among deists about freedom and determinism. Some, such as [[Anthony Collins]], actually were necessitarians.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Liberty and Necessity'' (1729).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immortality of the soul===
Deists hold a variety of beliefs about the soul. Some, such as Lord Herbert of Cherbury and [[William Wollaston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orr |first=John
 |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; held that souls exist, survive death, and in the afterlife are rewarded or punished by God for their behavior in life. Some, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], believed in reincarnation or resurrection. Others, such as [[Thomas Paine]], had definitive beliefs about the immortality of the soul:
{{quote|I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.|Thomas Paine, ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', Part I}}
{{quote|I trouble not myself about the manner of future existence. I content myself with believing, even to positive conviction, that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he pleases, either with or without this body; and it appears more probable to me that I shall continue to exist hereafter than that I should have had existence, as I now have, before that existence began.|Thomas Paine, ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', Part I, Recapitulation}}
Still others such as Anthony Collins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orr |first=John |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Bolingbroke]], [[Thomas Chubb]], and [[Peter Annet]] were materialists and either denied or doubted the immortality of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orr |first=John |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terminology===
Deist authors – and 17th- and 18th-century theologians in general – referred to God using a variety of vivid circumlocutions such as:{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
* [[Divine Providence]]
* [[Supreme Being]]
* [[Watchmaker analogy|Divine Watchmaker]]
* Nature's God. Used in the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]
* Father of Lights. Benjamin Franklin used this terminology when proposing that meetings of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] begin with prayers''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael E. Eidenmuller |url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/benfranklin.htm |title=Benjamin Franklin – Constitutional Convention Address on Prayer |publisher=Americanrhetoric.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical deism==

===Historical background===
Deistic thinking has existed since ancient times. Among the Ancient Greeks, [[Heraclitus]] conceived of a [[logos]], a supreme rational principle, and said the wisdom "by which all things are steered through all things" was "both willing and unwilling to be called [[Zeus]] (God)." [[Plato]] envisaged God as a [[Demiurge]] or 'craftsman'. Outside ancient Greece many other cultures have expressed views that resemble deism in some respects. However, the word "deism", as it is understood today, is generally used to refer to the movement toward natural theology or [[freethinking]] that occurred in 17th-century Europe, and specifically in Britain.

Natural theology is a facet of the revolution in world view that occurred in Europe in the 17th century. To understand the background to that revolution is also to understand the background of deism. Several cultural movements of the time contributed to the movement.&lt;ref&gt;The discussion of the background of deism is based on the excellent summary in "The Challenge of the Seventeenth Century" in ''The Historical Jesus Question'' by Gregory W. Dawes (Westminster: John Knox Press, 2001). Good discussions of individual deist writers can be found in ''The Seventeenth Century Background'' and ''The Eighteenth Century Background'' by [[Basil Willey]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discovery of diversity====
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin'', published by a team of [[Jesuit China mission|Jesuit missionaries]] at Paris in 1687.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://archive.org/stream/confuciussinarum00conf_0#page/n5/mode/2up |title=Confucius Sinarum Philosophus, sive, Scientia Sinensis Latine Exposita ''[''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese, or, Chinese Knowledge Explained in Latin'']'' |editor-last=Couplet |editor-first=Philippe |display-editors=1 |editor-link=Philippe Couplet |editor2-last=Intorcetta |editor2-first=Prospero |editor3=Christian Wolfgang Herdtrich |editor4=François de Rougemont |ref={{harvid|Couplet &amp; al.|1687}} |date=1687 |location=Paris |publisher=Daniel Horthemels }}. {{la icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Humanism|humanist]] tradition of the [[Renaissance]] included a revival of interest in Europe's classical past in ancient Greece and Rome. The veneration of that classical past, particularly pre-Christian Rome, the new availability of Greek philosophical works, the successes of humanism and [[natural science]] along with the fragmentation of Christianity and increased understanding of other faiths, all helped erode the image of the [[Catholic Church]] as the unique source of wisdom, destined to dominate the whole world.

In addition, study of classical documents led to the realization that some historical documents are less reliable than others, which led to the beginnings of [[biblical criticism]]. In particular, when scholars worked on biblical manuscripts, they began developing the principles of textual criticism and a view of the [[New Testament]] being the product of a particular historical period different from their own.

In addition to discovering diversity in the past, Europeans discovered diversity in the present. The voyages of discovery of the 16th and 17th centuries acquainted Europeans with new and different cultures in the Americas, in [[Asia]], and in the Pacific. They discovered a greater amount of cultural diversity than they had ever imagined, and the question arose of how this vast amount of human cultural diversity could be compatible with the biblical account of [[Noah]]'s descendants. In particular, the ideas of [[Confucius]], translated into European languages by [[Jesuit China mission|Jesuit missionaries]] like [[Michele Ruggieri]], [[Philippe Couplet]], and [[François Noël (missionary)|François Noël]], are thought to have had considerable influence on the deists and other philosophical groups of the Enlightenment who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;"Windows into China", John Parker, p.25, {{ISBN|0-89073-050-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Eastern origins of Western civilization", John Hobson, p194-195, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, cultural diversity with respect to religious beliefs could no longer be ignored. As Herbert wrote in ''De Religione Laici'' (1645):
{{quote|Many faiths or religions, clearly, exist or once existed in various countries and ages, and certainly there is not one of them that the lawgivers have not pronounced to be as it were divinely ordained, so that the Wayfarer finds one in Europe, another in Africa, and in Asia, still another in the very Indies.}}

====Religious conflict in Europe====
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Europe had been plagued by [[Sectarianism|sectarian conflicts]] and [[religious war]]s since the beginning of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. In 1642, when [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Lord Herbert of Cherbury]]'s ''De Veritate'' was published, the [[Thirty Years War]] had been raging on continental Europe for nearly 25 years. It was an enormously destructive war that (it is estimated) destroyed 15–20% of the population of Germany. At the same time, the [[English Civil War]] pitting King against Parliament was just beginning.

Such massive violence led to a search for natural religious truths{{spaced ndash}}truths that could be universally accepted, because they had been either "written in the book of Nature" or "engraved on the human mind" by God.

====Advances in scientific knowledge====
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The 17th century saw a remarkable advance in scientific knowledge, the scientific revolution. The work of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], and [[Galileo]] set aside the old notion that the earth was the center of the universe. These discoveries posed a serious challenge to biblical and religious authorities, Galileo's condemnation for heresy being an example. In consequence the Bible came to be seen as authoritative on matters of faith and morals but no longer authoritative (or meant to be) on science.

[[Isaac Newton]]'s (1642–1727) mathematical explanation of universal gravitation explained the behavior both of objects here on earth and of objects in the heavens in a way that promoted a worldview in which the natural universe is controlled by laws of nature. This, in turn, suggested a theology in which God created the universe, set it in [[Watchmaker analogy|motion]] controlled by natural law and retired from the scene. The new awareness of the explanatory power of universal natural law also produced a growing skepticism about such religious staples as [[miracle]]s (violations of natural law) and about religious books that reported them.

===Precursors===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Early works of biblical criticism, such as Thomas Hobbes's ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' and [[Spinoza]]'s ''[[Theologico-Political Treatise]]'', as well as works by lesser-known authors such as [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] and [[Isaac La Peyrère]], paved the way for the development of critical deism.

[[File:Edward Herbert 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury by Isaac Oliver.jpg|thumb|Edward Herbert, portrait by [[Isaac Oliver]] (1560–1617)]]
An important precursor to deism was the work of Edward, Lord [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Herbert]] of Cherbury (d. 1648). He has been called the "father of English deism", and his book ''De Veritate'' (''On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False'') (1624) "the first major statement of deism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Willey
 |first=Basil
 |title=The Seventeenth Century Background
 |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Orr
 |first=John
 |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |year=1934
 |pages=59 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his beliefs in divine intervention, particularly in response to prayer, are at odds with the basic ideas of deism. In Herbert's account of one incident, he prayed "I am not satisfied enough whether I shall publish this Book, De Veritate; if it be for Thy glory, I beseech Thee give me some Sign from Heaven, if not, I shall suppress it" and recounts that the response was "a loud tho' yet gentle Noise came from the Heavens (for it was like nothing on Earth)... I had the Sign I demanded".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert, The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury (Dublin, 1771), 244–245, as cited in Waligore p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like his contemporary [[Descartes]], Herbert searched for the foundations of
knowledge. In fact, the first two thirds of ''De Veritate'' are devoted to an exposition of Herbert's theory of knowledge. Herbert distinguished truths obtained through experience, and through reasoning about experience, from innate truths and from revealed truths. Innate truths are imprinted on our minds, and the evidence that they are so imprinted is that they are universally accepted. Herbert's term for universally accepted truths was ''notitiae communes''{{spaced ndash}}common notions.

In the realm of religion, Herbert believed that there were five common notions.&lt;ref name="González1984"/&gt;

{{quote|
* There is one Supreme God.
* He ought to be worshipped.
* Virtue and piety are the chief parts of divine worship.
* We ought to be sorry for our sins and repent of them
* Divine goodness doth dispense rewards and punishments both in this life and after it.
|Lord Herbert of Cherbury, ''The Antient Religion of the Gentiles, and Causes of Their Errors'', pp. 3–4, quoted in John Orr, ''English Deism'', p. 62}}

The following lengthy quote from Herbert can give the flavor of his writing and demonstrate the sense of the importance that Herbert attributed to innate Common Notions, which can help in understanding the effect of Locke's attack on innate ideas on Herbert's philosophy:

{{quote|No general agreement exists concerning the Gods, but there is universal recognition of God. Every religion in the past has acknowledged, every religion in the future will acknowledge, some sovereign deity among the Gods. ...
Accordingly that which is everywhere accepted as the supreme manifestation of deity, by whatever name it may be called, I term God.

While there is no general agreement concerning the worship of Gods, sacred beings, saints, and angels, yet the Common Notion or Universal Consent tells us that adoration ought to be reserved for the one God. Hence divine religion— and no race, however savage, has existed without some expression of it— is found established among all nations. ...

The connection of Virtue with Piety, defined in this work as the right conformation of the faculties, is and always has been held to be, the most important part of religious practice. There is no general agreement concerning rites, ceremonies, traditions...; but there is the greatest possible consensus of opinion concerning the right conformation of the faculties. ... Moral virtue... is and always has been esteemed by men in every age and place and respected in every land...

There is no general agreement concerning the various rites or mysteries which the priests have devised for the expiation of sin.... General agreement among religions, the nature of divine goodness, and above all conscience, tell us that our crimes may be washed away by true penitence, and that we can be restored to new union with God. ... I do not wish to consider here whether any other more appropriate means exists by which the divine justice may be appeased, since I have undertaken in this work only to rely on truths which are not open to dispute but are derived from the evidence of immediate perception and admitted by the whole world.

The rewards that are eternal have been variously placed in heaven, in the stars, in the [[Elysium|Elysian fields]]... Punishment has been thought to lie in [[metempsychosis]], in hell,... or in temporary or everlasting death. But all religion, law, philosophy, and ... conscience, teach openly or implicitly that punishment or reward awaits us after this life. ... [T]here is no nation, however barbarous, which has not and will not recognise the existence of punishments and rewards. That reward and punishment exist is, then, a Common Notion, though there is the greatest difference of opinion as to their nature, quality, extent, and mode.

It follows from these considerations that the dogmas which recognize a sovereign Deity, enjoin us to worship Him, command us to live a holy life, lead us to repent our sins, and warn us of future recompense or punishment, proceed from God and are inscribed within us in the form of Common Notions.

Revealed truth exists; and it would be unjust to ignore it. But its nature is quite distinct from the truth [based on Common Notions] ... [T]he truth of revelation depends upon the authority of him who reveals it. We must, then, proceed with great care in discerning what actually is revealed.... [W]e must take great care to avoid deception, for men who are depressed, superstitious, or ignorant of causes are always liable to it.
|Lord Herbert of Cherbury, ''De Veritate'', quoted in Gay, ''Deism: An Anthology'', pp. 29 ff.}}

According to Gay, Herbert had relatively few followers, and it was not until the 1680s that Herbert found a true successor in [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]] (1654–1693). Blount made one special contribution to the deist debate: "by utilizing his wide classical learning, Blount demonstrated how to use pagan writers, and pagan ideas, against Christianity. ... Other Deists were to follow his lead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Deism in Britain===

====John Locke====
The publication of [[John Locke]]'s ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (1689, but dated 1690) marks a major turning point in the history of deism. Since Herbert's ''De Veritate'', [[innate idea]]s had been the foundation of deist [[epistemology]]. Locke's famous attack on innate ideas in the first book of the ''Essay'' effectively destroyed that foundation and replaced it with a theory of knowledge based on experience. ''Innatist'' deism was replaced by ''empiricist'' deism. Locke himself was not a deist. He believed in both miracles and revelation, and he regarded miracles as the main proof of revelation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Orr
 |first=John
 |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits
 |publisher=Eerdmans
 |year=1934
 |pages=96–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Locke, constructive deism could no longer appeal to innate ideas for justification of its basic tenets such as the existence of God. Instead, under the influence of Locke and Newton, deists turned to natural theology and to arguments based on experience and nature: the cosmological argument and the [[argument from design]].

Peter Gay places the zenith of deism "from the end of the 1690s, when the vehement response to [[John Toland]]'s ''[[Christianity not Mysterious]]'' (1696) started the deist debate, to the end of the 1740s when the tepid response to [[Conyers Middleton]]'s ''Free Inquiry'' signalled its close."&lt;ref name="pgdeism1"&gt;{{cite book

{{quote|Among the Deists, only Anthony Collins (1676–1729) could claim much philosophical competence; only Conyers Middleton (1683–1750) was a really serious scholar. The best known Deists, notably John Toland (1670–1722) and Matthew Tindal (1656–1733), were talented publicists, clear without being deep, forceful but not subtle. ... Others, like Thomas Chubb (1679–1747), were self-educated freethinkers; a few, like [[Thomas Woolston]] (1669–1731), were close to madness.|Peter Gay| Deism: An Anthology&lt;ref name = "pgdeism1"/&gt;}}

During this period, prominent British deists included [[William Wollastson]], [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]], and
[[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism|title=Deism {{!}} religious philosophy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influential author [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley-Cooper, Third Earl of Shaftesbury]] is also usually categorized as a deist. Although he did not think of himself as a deist, he shared so many attitudes with deists that Gay calls him "a Deist in fact, if not in name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |last=Gay |first=Peter |title=Deism: An Anthology
 |publisher=Van Nostrand |year=1968 |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable late-classical deists include [[Peter Annet]] (1693–1769), [[Thomas Chubb]] (1679–1747), [[Thomas Morgan (deist)|Thomas Morgan]] (?–1743), and [[Conyers Middleton]] (1683–1750).

====Matthew Tindal====
Especially noteworthy is Matthew Tindal's ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' (1730), which "became, very soon after its publication, the focal center of the deist controversy. Because almost every argument, quotation, and issue raised for decades can be found here, the work is often termed 'the deist's Bible'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waring|first=Edward Graham|title=Deism and natural religion: a source book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JHXAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2013-05-16|year=1967|publisher=F. Ungar Pub. Co.|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following Locke's successful attack on innate ideas, Tindal's "Deist Bible" redefined the foundation of deist epistemology as knowledge based on experience or human reason. This effectively widened the gap between traditional Christians and what he called "Christian Deists", since this new foundation required that "revealed" truth be validated through human reason.

====David Hume====
[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|upright|David Hume]]
The writings of [[David Hume]] are sometimes credited with causing or contributing to the decline of deism. English deism, however, was already in decline before Hume's works on religion (1757,1779) were published.&lt;ref name=deismp140&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Gay |first=Peter |title=Deism: An Anthology |publisher=Van Nostrand |year=1968 |page=140}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some writers maintain that Hume's writings on religion were not very influential at the time that they were published.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Orr |first=John |title=English Deism: Its Roots and Its Fruits |publisher=Eerdmans |year=1934 |page=173}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, modern scholars find it interesting to study the implications of his thoughts for deism.
* Hume's skepticism about miracles makes him a natural ally of deism.
* His skepticism about the validity of natural religion cuts equally against deism and deism's opponents, who were also deeply involved in natural theology. But his famous ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion'' were not published until 1779, by which time deism had almost vanished in England.

In the ''Natural History of Religion'' (1757),  Hume contends that polytheism, not monotheism, was "the first and most ancient religion of mankind". In addition, contends Hume, the psychological basis of religion is not reason, but fear of the unknown.

{{quote | The primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible, unknown powers, while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind, may easily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, severity, cruelty, and malice must occur, and must augment the ghastliness and horror which oppresses the amazed religionist. ... And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily, without scruple, apply to their deity.
|David Hume, ''The Natural History of Religion'', section XIII}}

As E. Graham Waring saw it;&lt;ref name="Waring1967" /&gt;

{{quote | The clear reasonableness of natural religion disappeared before a semi-historical look at what can be known about uncivilized man— "a barbarous, necessitous animal," as Hume termed him. Natural religion, if by that term one means the actual religious beliefs and practices of uncivilized peoples, was seen to be a fabric of superstitions. Primitive man was no unspoiled philosopher, clearly seeing the truth of one God. And the history of religion was not, as the deists had implied, retrograde; the widespread phenomenon of superstition was caused less by priestly malice than by man's unreason as he confronted his experience.}}

Experts dispute whether Hume was a deist, an [[atheist]], or something else. Hume himself was uncomfortable with the terms ''deist'' and ''atheist'', and Hume scholar [[Paul Russell (philosopher)|Paul Russell]] has argued that the best and safest term for Hume's views is ''[[irreligion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

France had its own tradition of religious skepticism and natural theology in the works of [[Montaigne]], [[Pierre Bayle|Bayle]], and [[Montesquieu]]. The most famous of the French deists was [[Voltaire]], who acquired a taste for Newtonian science, and reinforcement of deistic inclinations, during a two-year visit to England starting in 1726.

French deists also included [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and [[Rousseau]]. For a short period of time during the French Revolution the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] was the state religion of France.

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s identification with deism is controversial. An argument in favor of Kant as deist is Allen Wood's "Kant's Deism," in P. Rossi and M. Wreen (eds.), ''Kant's Philosophy of Religion Reconsidered'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991); an argument against Kant as deist is Stephen Palmquist's [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/KTS.html "Kant's Theistic Solution"].

===Deism in the United States===
[[File:Thomas Paine.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Thomas Paine]]

In the United States, Enlightenment philosophy (which itself was heavily inspired by deist ideals) played a major role in creating the principle of religious freedom, expressed in Thomas Jefferson's letters and included in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American Founding Fathers, or Framers of the Constitution]], who were especially noted for being influenced by such philosophy include Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, [[Cornelius Harnett]], [[Gouverneur Morris]], and [[Hugh Williamson]]. Their political speeches show distinct deistic influence.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Other notable Founding Fathers may have been more directly deist. These include [[James Madison]], possibly [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Ethan Allen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Thomas Paine]] (who published ''[[The Age of Reason]]'', a treatise that helped to popularize deism throughout the United States and Europe).

Unlike the many deist tracts aimed at an educated elite, Paine's treatise explicitly appealed to ordinary people, using direct language familiar to the laboring classes. How widespread deism was among ordinary people in the United States is a matter of continued debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-place.org/interim/reviews/dilorenzo.shtml#.VV90HvlViko |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302202951/http://www.common-place.org/interim/reviews/dilorenzo.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-02 |title=Culture Wars in the Early Republic |publisher=Common-place |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major contributor was [[Elihu Palmer]] (1764–1806), who wrote the "Bible" of American deism in his ''[[Principles of Nature]]'' (1801) and attempted to organize deism by forming the "Deistical Society of New York" and other deistic societies from Maine to Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Kerry S.

In the United States there is controversy over whether the Founding Fathers were Christians, deists, or something in between.&lt;ref&gt;

Benjamin Franklin wrote in his autobiography, 
{{quote | Some books against Deism fell into my hands; they were said to be the substance of sermons preached at Boyle's lectures. It happened that they wrought an effect on me quite contrary to what was intended by them; for the arguments of the Deists, which were quoted to be refuted, appeared to me much stronger than the refutations; in short, I soon became a thorough Deist. My arguments perverted some others, particularly Collins and Ralph; but each of them having afterwards wrong'd me greatly without the least compunction, and recollecting Keith's conduct towards me (who was another freethinker) and my own towards Vernon and Miss Read, which at times gave me great trouble, I began to suspect that this doctrine, tho' it might be true, was not very useful.&lt;ref&gt;

Franklin also wrote that, "The Deity sometimes interferes by his particular Providence, and sets aside the Events which would otherwise have been produc'd in the Course of Nature, or by the Free Agency of Man."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Franklin, [https://web.archive.org/web/20021114204257/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf2/provdnc.htm On the Providence of God in the Government of the World] (1730).
&lt;/ref&gt;
He later stated, in the Constitutional Convention, that "the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth -- that God governs in the affairs of men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Max Farrand|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1057&amp;Itemid=27|title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787|location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1911|volume=1|page=451}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Thomas Jefferson is perhaps one of the [[Founding Fathers]] with the most outspoken of deist tendencies, though he is not known to have called himself a deist, generally referring to himself as a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]. In particular, his treatment of the Biblical gospels, which he titled ''[[The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth]]'', but subsequently became more commonly known as the ''Jefferson Bible'', exhibits a strong deist tendency of stripping away all supernatural and dogmatic references from the Christ story. However, Frazer, following the lead of [[Sydney Ahlstrom]], characterizes Jefferson as not a Deist but a [[Theistic rationalism|"theistic rationalist"]], because Jefferson believed in God's continuing activity in human affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gregg L.|last=Frazer|title=The Religious Beliefs of America's Founders: Reason, Revelation, Revolution|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2012|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sydney E.|last=Ahlstrom|title=A Religious History of the American People|year=2004|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazer cites Jefferson's ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', where he wrote, "I tremble" at the thought that "God is just," and he warned of eventual "supernatural influence" to abolish the scourge of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, ''Religious Beliefs of America's Founders,'' p. 128 quoting Jefferson's ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', 1800 ed., p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other scholars call Jefferson a "theistic rationalist" (although that term was coined later), such as {{Cite book|author=Gary Scott Smith|title=Faith and the Presidency: From George Washington to George W.

===Decline and rebirth of deism===
Deism is generally considered to have declined as an influential school of thought by around 1800, but has since experienced an extraordinary resurgence as its simple science- and reason-based philosophy has been rediscovered in the internet Age.

The 2001 [[American Religious Identification Survey]] (ARIS), which involved 50,000 participants, reported that the number of participants in the survey identifying themselves as deists grew at the rate of 717 percent between 1990 and 2001. If this were generalized to the US population as a whole, it would make deism the [[Claims to be the fastest growing religion|fastest-growing religious classification]] in the US for that period, with the reported total of 49,000 self-identified adherents representing about 0.02% of the US population in 2001.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;{{cite web

As of the time of the 2008 ARIS survey, 12 percent (38 million) of the American population were classified as deists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quote
|After the writings of Woolston and Tindal, English deism went into slow decline. ... By the 1730s, nearly all the arguments in behalf of Deism ... had been offered and refined; the intellectual caliber of leading Deists was none too impressive; and the opponents of deism finally mustered some formidable spokesmen. The Deists of these decades, Peter Annet (1693–1769), Thomas Chubb (1679–1747), and Thomas Morgan (?–1743), are of significance to the specialist alone. ... It had all been said before, and better. .|Peter Gay| Deism: An Anthology&lt;ref name=deismp140/&gt;}}

It is probably more accurate, however, to say that deism evolved into, and contributed to, other religious movements. The term ''deist'' became rarely used, but deist beliefs, ideas, and influences remained. They can be seen in 19th-century liberal British theology and in the rise of Unitarianism, which adopted many of deism's beliefs and ideas.

Although this decline has entirely reversed during the early 21st century, some commentators have suggested a variety of reasons for the former decline of "classical" deism (or perhaps actually simply a decline in the use of the term "Deism", rather than in the more universality Deist philosophy).

==Contemporary deism==
Contemporary deism attempts to integrate classical deism with modern philosophy and the current state of scientific knowledge. This attempt has produced a wide variety of personal beliefs under the broad classification of belief of "deism."

Classical deism held that a human's [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with God was impersonal: God created the world and set it in motion but does not actively intervene in individual human affairs but rather through [[divine providence]]. What this means is that God will give humanity such things as reason and compassion but this applies to all and not to individual intervention.

Some modern deists{{who|date= November 2018}} have modified this classical view and believe that humanity's relationship with God is [[transpersonal]], which means that God transcends the personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that it makes no sense to state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, which in turn is why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.

A modern definition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deism.com/deism_defined.htm|title=Deism Defined}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been created and provided by the World Union of Deists (WUD) that provides a modern understanding of deism:

{{Quote|Deism is the recognition of a universal creative force greater than that demonstrated by mankind, supported by personal observation of laws and designs in nature and the universe, perpetuated and validated by the innate ability of human reason coupled with the rejection of claims made by individuals and organized religions of having received special divine revelation.}}

Because deism asserts the existence of God without accepting claims of divine revelation, it appeals to people from both ends of the religious spectrum. [[Antony Flew]], for example, was a convert from atheism, and Raymond Fontaine was a Roman Catholic priest for over 20 years before converting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deism.com/to-natures-god.net|title=Raymond Fontaine's website: From Catholic Priest to Deist With Nature's God|publisher=deism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2001 [[American Religious Identification Survey]] (ARIS), which involved 50,000 participants, reported that the number of participants in the survey identifying themselves as deists grew at the rate of 717 percent between 1990 and 2001. If this were generalized to the US population as a whole, it would make deism the [[Claims to be the fastest growing religion|fastest-growing religious classification]] in the US for that period, with the reported total of 49,000 self-identified adherents representing about 0.02% of the US population at the time.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adherents.com"/&gt;

===Modern deistic organizations and websites===

In 1993, Bob Johnson established the first deist organization since the days of Thomas Paine and Elihu Palmer with the World Union of Deists. The WUD offered the monthly paper publication ''THINK!'' Currently the WUD offers two online deist publications, ''THINKonline!'' and ''Deistic Thought &amp; Action!'' As well as using the internet for spreading the deist message, the WUD is also conducting a direct mail campaign.

In 1996 the first web site dedicated to deism, deism.com, was launched by the World Union of Deists. In 1998, Sullivan-County.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/deism.htm |title=Deism and Reason |publisher=Sullivan-county.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally the Virginia/Tennessee affiliate of WUD and the second deism site on the web. It split from deism.com to promote more traditional and historical deist beliefs and history.

The Positive Deism movement began in 2004. Historically and to the present day, deists have been very critical of the revealed religions as well as trying to be constructive. Positive Deists focus their efforts solely on being constructive and avoid criticism of other faiths. In 2009 Chuck Clendenen, one of its adherents, published a book entitled "Deist: so that's what I am!". The aim of the book was to educate those who believed similarly, but did not know the words deism and deist, that there is a name for their belief.

In 2009, the World Union of Deists published a book on deism, ''Deism: A Revolution in Religion, A Revolution in You'' written by its founder and director, Bob Johnson. This book focuses on what deism has to offer both individuals and society. In 2010 the WUD published the book ''An Answer to C.S. Lewis' Mere Christianity'', which is a rebuttal to the book ''Mere Christianity'' by the Christian apologist [[C.S. Lewis]]. In 2014, the WUD published its third book, ''God Gave Us Reason, Not Religion'', which describes the difference between God and religion, and promotes innate reason as God's greatest gift to humanity, other than life itself. It proposes that people can have belief in The Supreme Intelligence/God that is beyond a reasonable doubt.

The World Union of Deists in 2016 became a producer of the film adaptation of Ian Ruskin's play [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3826458/ To Begin the World Over Again: The Life of Thomas Paine]. The film includes important coverage of Thomas Paine's profound Deism and his work to promote Deism.

In 2010, the Church of Deism (not affiliated with the World Union of Deists) was formed in an effort to extend the legal rights and privileges of more traditional religions to Deists while maintaining an absence of established dogma and ritual.

===Subcategories of contemporary deism===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Modern deists hold a wide range of views on the nature of God and God's relationship to the world. The common area of agreement is the desire to use reason, experience, and nature as the basis of belief.

There are a number of subcategories of modern deism, including [[monodeism]] (this being the default standard concept of deism), [[polydeism]], [[pandeism]], spiritual deism, [[process deism]], [[Christian deism]], [[scientific deism]], and [[humanistic deism]]. Some deists see design in nature and purpose in the universe and in their lives (Prime Designer). Others see God and the universe in a co-creative process (Prime Motivator). Some deists view God in classical terms and see God as observing humanity but not directly intervening in our lives (Prime Observer), while others see God as a subtle and persuasive spirit who created the world, but then stepped back to observe (Prime Mover).

====Pandeism====
{{Main|Pandeism}}
Pandeism combines elements of deism with elements of [[pantheism]], the belief that the universe is identical to God. Pandeism holds that God was a conscious and sentient force or entity that designed and created the universe, which operates by mechanisms set forth in the creation. God thus became an unconscious and nonresponsive being by ''becoming'' the universe. Other than this distinction (and the possibility that the universe will one day return to the state of being God), pandeistic beliefs are deistic. The earliest allusion to pandeism found to date is in 1787, in translator [[Gottfried Große]]'s interpretation of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]:

{{quote|Beym. Plinius, den man, wo nicht Spinozisten, doch einen '''Pandeisten''' nennen konnte, ist Natur oder Gott kein von der Welt getrenntes oder abgesondertes Wesen. Seine Natur ist die ganze Schöpfung im Konkreto, und eben so scheint es mit seiner Gottheit beschaffen zu seyn.&lt;ref name="Große"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Große|first=Gottfried|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6ro9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=pandeisten&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=pandeisten&amp;f=false|title=Naturgeschichte: mit erläuternden Anmerkungen|year=1787|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here Gottfried says that Pliny is not [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinozist]], but 'could be called a pandeist' whose Nature or God 'is not a being separate from the world. Its nature is the whole creation in concrete form, and thus it seems to be designed with its divinity.' The term was used in 1859 by [[German people|German]] philosophers and frequent collaborators [[Moritz Lazarus]] and [[Heymann Steinthal]] in ''Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft''. They wrote:

{{quote|Man stelle es also den Denkern frei, ob sie Theisten, Pan-theisten, Atheisten, Deisten (und warum nicht auch Pandeisten?)&lt;ref&gt;Moritz Lazarus and Heymann Steinthal, ''Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft'' (1859), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is translated as:

{{quote|So we should let these thinkers decide themselves whether they are theists, pan-theists, atheists, deists (and why not even pandeists?)}}

In the 1960s, theologian [[Charles Hartshorne]] scrupulously examined and rejected both deism and pandeism (as well as pantheism) in favor of a conception of God whose characteristics included "absolute perfection in some respects, relative perfection in all others" or "AR", writing that this theory "is able consistently to embrace all that is positive in either deism or pandeism", concluding that "panentheistic doctrine contains all of deism and pandeism except their arbitrary negations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Hartshorne|title=Man's Vision of God and the Logic of Theism|year=1964|page=348|isbn=0-208-00498-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary deist opinions on prayer===
Many classical deists were critical of some types of prayer. For example, in ''[[Matthew Tindal#Christianity as Old as the Creation|Christianity as Old as the Creation]]'', Matthew Tindal argues against praying for miracles, but advocates prayer as both a human duty and a human need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamicdeism.org/library/christianity_as_old_as_the_creat.htm#_Toc86950608|title=External link to portion of text|publisher=|access-date=2007-01-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209010328/http://www.dynamicdeism.org/library/christianity_as_old_as_the_creat.htm#_Toc86950608#_Toc86950608|archive-date=2007-02-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, deists hold a variety of opinions about prayer:
* Some contemporary deists{{who|date= November 2018}} believe (with the classical deists) that God has created the universe perfectly, so no amount of supplication, request, or begging can change the fundamental nature of the universe.
* Some deists{{who|date= November 2018}} believe that God is not an entity that can be contacted by human beings through petitions for relief; rather, God can only be experienced through the nature of the universe.
* Most deists do not believe in divine intervention, but still find value in prayer as a form of meditation, self-cleansing, and spiritual renewal. Such prayers are often appreciative (that is, "Thank you for ...") rather than supplicative (that is, "Please, God, grant me ...").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deism.com/deism_defined.htm |title=Deism Defined, Welcome to Deism, Deist Glossary and Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Deism.com |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some deists practice meditation and make frequent use of [[affirmative prayer]], a non-supplicative form of prayer that is common in the [[New Thought]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lockard |first1=Jim |title=Affirmative Prayer |url=https://newthoughtevolutionary.wordpress.com/2017/11/11/thoughts-prayers/ |website=Affirmative Prayer |publisher=Affirmative Prayer |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent discussion of the role of deism===
[[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], in his 2007 book ''[[A Secular Age]]'', showed the historical role of deism, leading to what he calls an exclusive humanism. This humanism invokes a moral order, whose [[ontic]] commitment is wholly intra-human, with no reference to transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=C|year=2007|title=A Secular Age|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the special achievements of such deism-based humanism is that it discloses new, anthropocentric moral sources by which human beings are motivated and empowered to accomplish acts of mutual benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=C|year=2007|title=A Secular Age|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the province of a buffered, disengaged self, which is the locus of dignity, freedom and discipline, and is endowed with a sense of human capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=C|year=2007|title=A Secular Age|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Taylor, by the early 19th century this deism-mediated exclusive humanism developed as an alternative to Christian faith in a [[personal God]] and an order of miracles and mystery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4348">'''Descriptive botanical names''' are [[botanical nomenclature|scientific names]] of groups of plants that are irregular, not being derived systematically from the name of a [[type genus]].  They may describe some characteristics of the group in general or may be a name already in existence before regularised scientific nomenclature.

Descriptive names can occur above or at the rank of [[rank (botany)|family]]. There is only a single descriptive below the rank of family (the subfamily [[Papilionoideae]]).

==Above the rank of family==
Descriptive names above the rank of family are governed by Article 16&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art16|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|year=2012}} Article 16&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), which rules that a name above the rank of family may be either be ‘automatically typified’ (such as Magnoliophyta and Magnoliopsida from the type genus ''Magnolia'') or be descriptive.

Descriptive names of this type may be used unchanged at different ranks (without modifying the suffix). These descriptive plant names are decreasing in importance, becoming less common than ‘automatically typified names’, but many are still in use, such as:
: Plantae, [[Algae]], [[Musci]], [[Fungi]], [[Embryophyta]], [[Tracheophyta]], [[Spermatophyta]], [[Gymnospermae]], [[Coniferae]], [[Coniferales]], [[Angiospermae]], [[Monocotyledones]], [[Dicotyledones]], etc.

Many of these descriptive names have a very long history, often preceding [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Some are [[Classical Latin]] common nouns in the [[nominative case|nominative]] plural, meaning for instance ‘the plants’, ‘the seaweeds’, ‘the mosses’. Like all names above the rank of family, these names follow the Latin grammatical rules of nouns in the plural, and are written with an initial capital letter.

==At the rank of family==
Article 18.5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art18|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|year=2012}} Article 18&lt;/ref&gt; of the ICN allows a descriptive name, of long usage, for the following eight families.  For each of these families there also exists a name based on the name of an included genus (an alternative name that is also allowed, here in parentheses):

* Compositae = "[[composite flower|composite]]s"  (alternative name: Asteraceae, based on the genus [[Aster (genus)|''Aster'']])
* Cruciferae = "cross-bearers"  (alternative name: Brassicaceae, based on the genus ''[[Brassica]]'')
* Gramineae = "grasses"  (alternative name: Poaceae, based on the genus ''[[Poa]]'')
* Guttiferae = "latex-carriers"  (alternative name: Clusiaceae, based on the genus ''[[Clusia]]'')
* Labiatae = "lipped ones"  (alternative name: Lamiaceae, based on the genus ''[[Lamium]]'')
* Leguminosae = "legumes"  (alternative name: Fabaceae, based on the genus ''Faba'', now considered a section of genus ''[[Vicia]]'')
* Palmae = "palms"  (alternative name: Arecaceae, based on the genus ''[[Areca]]'')
* Umbelliferae = "parasol-bearers" (alternative name: Apiaceae, based on the genus ''[[Apium]]'')

==Subfamily==
Special provision has been made in Article 19.8 for the plant subfamily name [[Papilionoideae]] to be an alternative name of the subfamily Faboideae,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art19|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|year=2012}} Article 19&lt;/ref&gt; because the family Papilionaceae had previously been [[conserved name|conserved]] when many botanists considered it to be a separate family from Fabaceae (Leguminosae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lanjouw, J. |author2=Sprague, T.A. |year=1935|title=Additions and Amendments to the International Rules of Botanical Nomenclature, Ed. 3: (35) Appendix Ii. Nomina Familiarum conservanda|journal=Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Gardens, Kew)|volume=1935|issue=2|pages=79–82|jstor=4107153|doi=10.2307/4107153}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name is not based on any plant genus named ''[[Papilio]]'' (a butterfly), but is a descriptive name meaning that the plant has butterfly-like flowers.

__NOTOC__
'''Descriptive complexity''' is a branch of [[computational complexity theory]] and of [[finite model theory]] that characterizes [[complexity class]]es by the type of [[logic]] needed to express the languages in them. For example, [[PH (complexity)|PH]], the union of all complexity classes in the polynomial hierarchy, is precisely the class of languages expressible by statements of [[second-order logic]]. This connection between complexity and the logic of finite structures allows results to be transferred easily from one area to the other, facilitating new proof methods and providing additional evidence that the main complexity classes are somehow "natural" and not tied to the specific [[abstract machine]]s used to define them.

Specifically, each [[logical system]] produces a set of [[query (complexity)|queries]] expressible in it. The queries – when restricted to finite structures – correspond to the [[computational problem]]s of traditional complexity theory.

The first main result of descriptive complexity was [[Fagin's theorem]], shown by [[Ronald Fagin]] in 1974. It established that [[NP (complexity)|NP]] is precisely the set of languages expressible by sentences of existential [[second-order logic]]; that is, second order logic excluding universal quantification over relations, functions, and subsets. Many other classes were later characterized in such a manner, most of them by [[Neil Immerman]]:
* [[First-order logic]] defines the class [[FO (complexity)|FO]], corresponding to [[AC0|AC&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;]], the languages recognized by polynomial-size circuits of bounded depth, which equals the languages recognized by a [[concurrent random access machine]] in constant time.
* First-order logic with a commutative, [[transitive closure]] operator added yields [[SL (complexity)|SL]], which equals [[L (complexity)|L]], problems solvable in logarithmic space.
* First-order logic with a [[transitive closure]] operator yields [[NL (complexity)|NL]], the problems solvable in nondeterministic logarithmic space.
* In the presence of linear order, first-order logic with a [[least fixed point]] operator gives [[P (complexity)|P]], the problems solvable in deterministic polynomial time.
* Existential second-order logic yields [[NP (complexity)|NP]], as mentioned above.
* Universal second-order logic (excluding existential second-order quantification) yields co-NP.
* [[SO (complexity)|Second-order]] logic corresponds to [[PH (complexity)|PH]].
* Second-order logic with a [[transitive closure]] (commutative or not) yields [[PSPACE]], the problems solvable in polynomial space.
* Second-order logic with a [[least fixed point]] operator gives [[EXPTIME]], the problems solvable in exponential time.
* [[HO (complexity)|&lt;math&gt;\exist{\color{Blue}\mathsf{HO}}^i&lt;/math&gt;]], logic with existential quantifier of order {{mvar|i}} followed by a formula of order &lt;math&gt;i-1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to [[NTIME|&lt;math&gt;{\color{Blue}\mathsf{NTIME}}(\exp_2^{i-2}(n^{O(1)}))&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Lauri Hella and José María Turull-Torres | title =Computing queries with higher-order logics | journal =Theoretical Computer Science | volume = 355 | edition= (what is called "number" in bibtex) | issue = 2 | year = 2006 | pages = 197–214   | issn =0304-3975 | publisher =Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd. | place =  Essex, UK | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142890.1142897 | doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2006.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dhaneswar Khera Buddha image inscription''' is an epigraphic record on the base of a bronze image of the [[Buddha]] recording its dedication by the wife of Harirāja of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] lineage. The inscription provides an important documentation on the local Gupta dynasty and has been dated to the early 5th Century AD.

==Discovery==
''Dhaneswar Khera'' (sometimes also referred to as Danesar Khera) is located near the village of Icchāwar or Nicchāwar in Jaspura Tahsil, [[Banda District]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. The bronze statue was discovered in the nineteenth century with two others and published by William Hooey and [[Vincent Arthur Smith]] in 1895. Since 1969 it has been kept in the [[British Museum]] where it is displayed in the Asian Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/b/bronze_figure_of_the_seated_bu.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The other two statues from the hoard are in the [[Bangkok National Museum]] and the [[Nelson Atkins Museum of Art]] in Kansas City.&lt;ref&gt;Sheila E. Hoey Middleton, "The Third Buddha," ''South Asian Studies'' 18.1 (2002): pp. 67-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelson-atkins.org/art/CollectionDatabase_ImageView.cfm?id=27864&amp;theme=SseAsia Nelson Atkins Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Inscription==
The inscription is written in [[Sanskrit]] on the pedestal of the sculpture. It was first noted in 1949 and subsequently published by [[Dineschandra Sircar|D. C. Sircar]] in ''[[Epigraphia Indica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''JOR'' 28 (1949): p. 185ff; D. C. Sircar, "Copper Coin of Harigupta", ''Epigraphia Indica'' 33 (1959-60): p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The record was later discussed by P. L. Gupta.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Gupta, ''Imperial Guptas'', p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translation ==
A literal translation of the text is below:

1) deya-dharmmo=ya[ṃ*] Gupta=vaṅśo [read: vaṃś]-odita-śrī-Harirājasya ra [read: rā]jñī-mahādevyā[ḥ] [|*] yad=attra puṇya[ṃ*] tad=bhavatu

2) sa[rvva]-sa[TV(ttvā)nā][ṃ*] māta(tā)-pitṛ-pū[rvva]ṅgama(me)na anuttara-pada-jñāna (n-ā)vāptaye [||*]

The inscription records that the statue of the Buddha was the meritorious gift (''deyadharma'') of Mahādevī, the queen of Harirāja. The ruler Hariāja is described as being ‘born in the Gupta lineage’ who is also recorded on a copper-plate charter from [[Vārānasī]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=223694&amp;partId=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Digital Media Academy''' (commonly referred to as "DMA") is a [[digital art]] and technology education company, located in [[Los Gatos]], CA, primarily offering art and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] [[summer camp]] programs for kids, age 6-18, at several universities in the US and Canada, including [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[New York University|NYU]], [[University of British Columbia|UBC]], [[University of Toronto|UoT]], among other prestigious ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/#locations Digital Media Academy Website - Locations]&lt;/ref&gt; DMA now also licenses curriculum and other STEM resources to schools internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/tools-for-educators/|title=Tools for Educators - Digital Media Academy|work=Digital Media Academy|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMA was officially incorporated in 2002,  but was incubated at [[Stanford University]] in the late 1990s as the Academy for New Media, a program of Stanford's Academic Computing department. The Academy for New Media was created at Stanford by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-gibson-247a966/ Phil Gibson] in 1999 as an outreach to K-12 educators and high-school students interested in learning the latest digital media software tools from award-winning creative professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/june20/newmedia-620.html Stanford Report], June 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  In Fall 2001, the Academy for New Media fell victim to University budget cuts and the program was transitioned away from Stanford to a private entity – and Digital Media Academy was born. The [[Stanford University]] Continuing Studies department offered CEU credit through Digital Media Academy from 2002-2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalmediaacademy.org/adults/courses/certification-dma-credits.html Digital Media Academy Website - Certifications and Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;
Students may attend Digital Media Academy summer camps with the [[day camp]] or residential camp option.  These camps offer sports and recreation, while being known as a [[tech camp]] primarily.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31428">'''Digital history''' is the use of [[digital media]] to further [[historical]] analysis, presentation, and research.  It is a branch of the [[Digital humanities]] and an extension of [[quantitative history]], [[cliometrics]], and computing.  Digital history is commonly digital public history, concerned primarily with engaging online audiences with historical content, or, digital research methods, that further academic research. Digital history outputs include: digital archives, online presentations, data visualizations, interactive maps, time-lines, audio files, and virtual worlds to make history more accessible to the user. A researcher can interact with, explore and visualise, the output more easily than with conventional [[historiography|historiographical material]]. Recent digital history projects focus on creativity, collaboration, and technical innovation, [[text mining]], [[corpus linguistics]], [[Social network analysis|network analysis]], [[3D Modeling]], and [[big data]] analysis. Utilising these resources the user can rapidly develop new analyses that can link to, extend, and bring to life existing histories.

== History ==
Early digital history in the 1960s and 70s focused on quantitative analyses, primarily of demographic data - censuses, election returns, city directories, etc. These early computers could be programmed to conduct statistical analyses of these records, creating tallies, or seeking trends across records.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dollar and Richard Jensen, ''Historians Guide to Statistics'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;  This research into historical demography was rooted in the rise of [[social history]] as a field of historical interest. The historians involved in this work sought to quantify past societies, to come to new conclusions about communities and population. Computers proved capable tools for that type of work.  By the late 1970s younger historians turned to cultural studies, but the outpouring of quantitive studies by established scholars continued. Since then, [[Quantitative history]] and [[Cliometrics]] have been used primarily by historically-minded economists and political scientists.  In the late 1980s quantifiers founded [[Association for History and Computing|The Association for History and Computing]].  This movement provided some of the impetus for the rise of digital history in the 1990s.&lt;ref name ="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book| last =Thomas, III| first =William G.| chapter =Computing and the Historical Imagination| title =A Companion to Digital Humanities| editor =Susan Schreibman |editor2=Ray Siemens |editor3=John Unsworth| publisher =[[Blackwell Publishing|Blackwell]]| year =2004| location =Oxford| url =http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/| accessdate =2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent roots of digital history were in software rather than online networks.  In 1982, the [[Library of Congress]] embarked on its Optical Disk Pilot Project, which placed text and images from its collection on to laserdiscs and CD-ROMs. The library started offering online exhibits in 1992 when it launched Selected Civil War Photographs. In 1993, [[Roy Rosenzweig]], along with Steve Brier and [[Joshua Brown (historian)|Josh Brown]], produced their award-winning CD-ROM ''Who Built America? From the Centennial Exposition of 1876 to the Great War of 1914'', designed for [[Apple Inc.|Apple, Inc.]] that integrated images, text, film and sound clips, displayed in a visual interface that supported a text narrative.&lt;ref name="burton"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burton |first=Orville Vernon |title=American Digital History |journal=Social Science Computer Review |volume=23 |issue=2 |date=Summer 2005 |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/30 |pages=206–220 |accessdate=2008-03-31 |doi=10.1177/0894439304273317 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318045758/http://chnm.gmu.edu/resources/essays/d/30 |archivedate=2008-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest online digital history projects were The Heritage Project of the University of Kansas and [[medieval]] historian Dr. Lynn Nelson's World History Index and History Central Catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vlib.iue.it/history/index.html|title=WWW-VL History Central Catalogue Florence (IT)|first=Serge Noiret and Inaki Lopez|last=Martin|date=5 June 2004|website=vlib.iue.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was [[The Valley of the Shadow]], conceived in 1991 by current [[University of Richmond]] President [[Edward L. Ayers]], who was then at the [[University of Virginia]]. The [[Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities]] (IATH) at the University of Virginia adopted the Valley Project and partnered with [[IBM]] to collect and transcribe historical sources into digital files.  The project collected data related to Augusta County in [[Virginia]] and Franklin County in [[Pennsylvania]] during the [[American Civil War]].  In 1996, William G. Thomas III joined Ayers on the Valley Project.  Together, they produced an online article entitled "The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities," which also appeared in the ''American Historical Review'' in 2003 [http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/AHR/].  A CD-ROM also accompanied the Valley Project, published by [[W. W. Norton and Company]] in 2000.&lt;ref name ="ayers"&gt;{{cite book| last =Ayers| first =Edward L.| authorlink =Edward L. Ayers| title =What Caused the Civil War| publisher =[[W. W. Norton and Company]]| year =2005| location =New York| isbn = 0-393-05947-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenzweig, who died October 11, 2007,&lt;ref name="rozensweigobit"&gt;{{cite news| last=Bernstein| first=Adam| title=Digital Historian Roy A. Rosenzweig| publisher=Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202489.html| accessdate =2008-04-02 | date=2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded the [[Center for History and New Media]] (CHNM) at [[George Mason University]] in 1994.  Today, CHNM boasts several digital tools available to historians, such as [[Zotero]], [[Omeka]] or [[Tropy]].  In 1997, Ayers and Thomas used the term "digital history" when they proposed and founded the Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH) at the University of Virginia, the earliest center devoted exclusively to history.&lt;ref name="burton" /&gt;  Several other institutions promoting digital history include the Center for Humane Arts, Letters, and Social Sciences Online (MATRIX) at Michigan State University, Maryland's Institute for Technology in the Humanities, and the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska.  In 2004, Emory University launched Southern Spaces, a "peer-reviewed Internet journal and scholarly forum" examining the history of the South.

== Applications ==
There are many potential benefits to the use of digital history when combined with traditional historical methods. Some of these applications include:
* Combining traditional historical methods and new research methods in order to come to new conclusions.
* Using different tools to extract and analyse larger amounts of data that would not be manageable otherwise.
* Create models and maps of data extracted to create a visualisation of the data.
* Data extracted and analysed can be placed alongside existing historiography to increase combined historical knowledge.
By adding new research methods to existing historical method, historians can benefit greatly from the ability to work with larger amounts of data and develop new interpretations from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beals|first1=M. H.|title=Stuck in the Middle: Developing Research Workflows for a Multi-scale Text Analysis|journal=Journal of Victorian Culture|date=21 March 2017|pages=1–8|doi=10.1080/13555502.2017.1301178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Navickas|first1=Katrina|last2=Crymble|first2=Adam|title=From Chartist Newspaper to Digital Map of Grass-roots Meetings, 1841–44: Documenting Workflows|journal=Journal of Victorian Culture|date=20 March 2017|pages=1–16|doi=10.1080/13555502.2017.1301179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable projects ==
[[File:Social Network Analysis Visualization.png|thumb|Example of historical research using digital means: network visualization of the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation|ICIC]] archives, showing thousands of documents exchanged between [[League of Nations]] experts during the [[interwar period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 10| issue = 3| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = La connaissance est un réseau| journal =Les Cahiers du Numérique| date = 2014| pages = 37–54| url = http://www.cairn.info/resume.php?ID_ARTICLE=LCN_103_0037| doi=10.3166/lcn.10.3.37-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]The collaborative nature of most digital history endeavors has meant that the discipline has developed primarily at institutions with the resources to sponsor content research and technical innovation. Two of the first centers, George Mason University's Center for History and New Media and the Virginia Center for Digital History at the University of Virginia  have been among the leaders in the development of digital history projects and the education of digital historians.

Some of the noteworthy projects emerging from these pioneering centers are The Geography of Slavery, [[Texas Slavery Project|The Texas Slavery Project]], and The Countryside Transformed at VCDH and Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution and The Lost Museum at the CHNM. In each of these projects, mediated archives holding multiple types of sources are combined with digital tools to analyze and illuminate an historical question to a varying degree; this integration of content and tools with analysis is one of the hallmarks of digital history – projects move beyond archives or collections and into scholarly analysis and the use of digital tools to develop that analysis. The differences between the ways projects incorporate these integrations are a measure of the development of the field and point to the ongoing debates over what digital history can and should be.

While many of the projects at VCDH, CHNM, and other university's centers have been geared towards academics and post-secondary education, the [[University of Victoria]] (British Columbia), in conjunction with the [[Université de Sherbrooke]] and the [[Ontario Institute for Studies in Education]] at the University of Toronto, has created as series of projects for all ages, "Great Unsolved Mysteries in Canadian History."  Laden with instructional aids, this site asks teachers to introduce students to historical research methods to help them develop analytical skills and a sense of the complexities of their national history. Issues of race, religion, and gender are addressed in carefully constructed modules that cover incidents in Canadian history from Viking exploration through the 1920s. One of the original co-creators of the project, John Lutz has also developed Victoria's Victoria [http://web.uvic.ca/vv/] with the University of Victoria and [[Malaspina University-College]].

In addition to Ayers, Thomas, Lutz, and Rosenzweig, numerous other individual scholars work with digital history techniques and have made and/or continue to make important contributions to the field. Robert Darnton's 2000 article, "An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris" was supplemented with electronic resources and is an early model of the discussions around digital history and its future in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darnton |first=Robert |title=An Early Information Society: News and the Media in Eighteenth-Century Paris |journal=American Historical Review |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=2000 |url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.1/ah000001.html |accessdate=2008-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217185549/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/105.1/ah000001.html |archivedate=2007-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first major digital projects to be reviewed by the American Historical Review (AHR) was Philip Ethington's "Los Angeles and the Problem of Urban Historical Knowledge" [http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/LAS/history/historylab/LAPUHK/index.html]—a multimedia exploration of changes to Los Angeles' physical profile over the course of several decades.  Patrick Manning, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of World History at the University of Pittsburgh, developed the CD-ROM project "Migration in Modern World History, 1500-2000." In the "African Slave Demography Project," Manning created a demographic simulation of the slave trade to show precisely how declined in West and Central Africa between 1730 and 1850 as well as in East Africa between the years 1820 and 1890 due to slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Patrick. 2007. Digital World History: An Agenda. Digital History portal, Department of History, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, available at http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/essays/manningessay.php.&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Reiff, of UCLA, co-edited the print and online versions of the Encyclopedia of Chicago. Andrew J. Torget, founded the Texas Slavery Project while at VCDH and continues to develop the site as he completes his PhD—likely a model for new digital scholars who will incorporate digital components into larger research agendas.

Another notable project that makes use of digital tools for historical practice is The [[Quilt Index]].&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluh, Mark. 2008. From Digital Repositories to Information Habitats: H-Net, the Quilt Index, Cyber Infrastructure, and Digital Humanities. First Monday 13(8): available at http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/viewArticle/2230/2019&lt;/ref&gt;  As scholars became increasingly interested in women's history, quilts became valuable to study.  The Quilt Index is an online collaborative database where quilt owners can upload pictures and data about their quilts.  This project was created due to the difficulty of collecting quilts.  Firstly, they were in the possession of various institutions, archives, and even civilians.  And secondly, they can be too fragile or bulky for physical transport.

Also in the field of women's history is ''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution''. which highlights the collective action and individual achievements of women from the 1940s to the present.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/ ''Click! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution''].&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a pilot project began in 2002 to create a digital library of British History.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/|title=British History Online {{!}} The core printed primary and secondary sources for the medieval and modern history of the British Isles|website=www.british-history.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has developed into an extensive collection of over 1,200 volumes, bringing together primary and secondary sources from libraries, archives, museums and academics. Another significant project is the Old Bailey Online,a digital collection of all proceedings between 1674 and 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/|title=Old Bailey Online - The Proceedings of the Old Bailey, 1674-1913 - Central Criminal Court|website=www.oldbaileyonline.org|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the digitized records, the Old Bailey Online website provides historical and legal background information, research guides,and  educational resources for students.

== Digital history classes ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
The Digital History classes at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] have learned skills in [[digital mapping]] and [[Python programming]], which makes it more accessible and easier to analyse large quantities of source data. One project that the class worked on included taking data on weather, crime and poverty and using digital history skills to analyse the trends and patterns between them. This then allowed them to use their traditional history skills to evaluate the significance of the trends. Another project was using digital mapping to compare the differences between various groups of students who studied at Oxford derived from [[British History Online]].

At [[Cal State East Bay]], 12-15 history majors meet in the science building's computer lab to go over new and old software that could be used for the creation or presentation of history. Professor Kaatz specializes in early Christianity and ancient Rome, and needs to be well informed in the area of digitization. The digital history program is fairly new, and larger universities like Harvard and Stanford also have digital programs that are branches of their history programs.

[[California State University San Marcos]] offers a history graduate studies program with an emphasis on digital history. The master's thesis requirement is strongly encouraged to be half digital and half written, but the requirement can still be fulfilled by a traditional fully written thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csusm.edu/history/masters/|title=Overview - CSUSM|website=www.csusm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

Digital technology tools arrange ideas and promote the unique analysis of data, with many tools previously unavailable to historians opening new avenues for collaboration, text mining, and [[big data]] analysis. In addition, digital history offers tools for the presentation and access to historical knowledge online.

Digital historians may use web development tools, such as [[WYSIWYG]] [[HTML]]-editor [[Adobe Dreamweaver]]. Other tools create more interactive digital history, such as Databases, which provide greater capacity for information storage and retrieval in a definable way.  Databases with features like [[Structured Query Language]] (SQL) and [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) arrange materials in a formal manner and allow precise searching for keywords, dates, and other data characteristics. The online article "The Differences Slavery Made: A Close Analysis of Two American Communities" used XML for presenting and connecting evidence with detailed historiographical discussions.  The ''Valley of the Shadow'' project also employed XML to convert all of the archive's letters, diaries, and newspapers for full text searching capabilities. Coding languages such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] may be used in order to digitally sort and filter data, whilst [[Google Fusion Tables]] can be used for the geographical mapping of data.

Digital historians may use [[content management systems]] (CSM) to store their digital collection that includes audio, visual, images and text for an online web display. Examples of these systems include: [[Drupal]], [[WordPress]], and [[Omeka]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean Rehberger. "Getting Oral History Online: Collections Management Applications." Oral History Review 40, no. 1 (2013): 83-94. https://muse.jhu.edu/ (accessed February 12, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Differences Slavery Made'' also used [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) to analyze and understand the spatial arrangement of social structures.  For the article, Ayers and Thomas created many new maps through GIS technology to produce detailed images of Augusta and Franklin counties never before possible.   GIS and its many components remain helpful for studying history and visualizing change over time.

The Semantic Interoperability of Metadata and Information in unLike Environments ([[SIMILE]]) project at [[MIT]] develops robust, open source tools that enable access, management, and envisaging digital assets.   Among the many tools built by SIMILE, the Timeline tool, which employs a [[DHTML]]-based AJAXy widget, allows digital historians to create dynamic, customizable timelines for visualizing time-based events.  The Timeline page on the SIMILE website declares that their tool "is like [[Google Maps]] for time-based information."  Additionally, SIMILE's Exhibit tool boasts a customizable structure for sorting and presenting data [https://web.archive.org/web/20100605063616/http://digitalhistory.unl.edu/t-reviews/exhibitgant.html].   Exhibit, written in [[Javascript]], creates interactive, data-rich web pages without the need for any programming or database creation knowledge.

Textual analysis software allows  historians to make new use of old sources by finding  patterns in large collections of documents or even just analyzing a source for frequency of terms. Textual analysis software allows historians to "text mine", a term used to describe correlations and themes in the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/pages/intro|title=Mining the Dispatch|website=dsl.richmond.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several textual-analysis programs available online, from sophisticated ones that allow the researcher to tailor the program to handle large amounts of data, like [http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/ MALLET], and straightforward programs like [http://tokenx.unl.edu/ TokenX], which generates word-frequency lists and word clouds to illustrate language usage and significance, to basic ones like [http://www.wordle.net/ wordle], which offers simple visualizations of word frequency and relationships.  Some websites provide textual analysis on their content automatically. Online bookmarking and research tool [[del.icio.us]] uses [[tag clouds]] to visually depict the frequency and importance of user-generated tags, and the recently instituted Google Ngram Viewer allows viewers to search the commonality of textual themes by year.

However, with the development of digital history and the technology used to produce it, there has been questions raised over the validity of it. One such issue, is that raised by Jean Francois Baudrillard. He says that 'Western Culture introduced significant modifications to the way it produced the real, by intensifying it and heightening it into a domain of reality in hyperspace: hyper-reality'.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Gane, Jean Baudrillard: In Radical Uncertainty,  (Pluto Press, 2000) P. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2103">The '''Elsenburg Agricultural Training Institute''' (officially known, from 1 April 2004, as the '''Cape Institute for Agricultural Training: Elsenburg''') was established in 1898 as the first agricultural [[college]] of its kind in [[South Africa]]. It offers a bachelor's degree in agriculture in association with the Faculty of [[Agriculture]] and Forestry Sciences at the [[University of Stellenbosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsenburg.com Elsenburg Agricultural Training Institute home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The college attracted relatively few [[students]] in its first years: having been established in 1898, there were five graduates by June 1899. An average of 44 students per year were enrolled in the years between the turn of the century and the outbreak of World War I, when numbers crashed.{{Tone-inline|date=November 2014}}

An association with the University of Stellenbosch was established in 1926, whereafter a [[diploma]] [[course (education)|course]] was offered to equip prospective [[farmers]].

The [[government]] [[Department of Agriculture (South Africa)|Department of Agriculture]] accepted responsibility for agricultural training at the college from 1973. A significant addition to the academic courses given in this period was a diploma in cellar technology, making the college, since 1976, a major training institution for South African winemakers.

In the post-1994 period, under a new provincial administration in the newly established [[Western Cape|Western Cape Province]], the Elsenburg and Kromme Rhee colleges of agriculture amalgamated. A Centre for Further Education and Training was established to relieve the Department of Agriculture of its responsibilities.

The renewed association with the University of the Stellenbosch was inaugurated on 1 April 2004.

'''Environmental assessment'''&lt;section begin=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]] --&gt; ('''EA''') is the assessment of the [[environmental impact|environmental consequences]] (positive and negative) of a plan, policy, program, or actual projects prior to the decision to move forward with the proposed action. In this context, the term "'''environmental impact assessment'''" ('''EIA''') is usually used when applied to actual projects by individuals or companies and the term "[[strategic environmental assessment]]" (SEA) applies to policies, plans and programmes most often proposed by organs of state.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, A. J., Duinker, P. N., Walker, T. R. (2018). The Application of Science in Environmental Impact Assessment. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2011). [https://www.amazon.com/Environmental-Impact-Assessment-Professional-Practices/dp/1439828733/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486945778&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Environmental Impact Assessment: A Guide to Best Professional Practices]. Chapter 5. {{ISBN|978-1439828731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental assessments may be governed by rules of [[Administrative law|administrative procedure]] regarding public participation and documentation of decision making, and may be subject to judicial review. &lt;section end=overview /&gt;&lt;!--This paragraph is transcluded to [[Environmental law]]. Please do not delete this code --&gt;

The purpose of the assessment is to ensure that decision makers consider the environmental impacts when deciding whether or not to proceed with a project. The International Association for Impact Assessment (IAIA) defines an environmental impact assessment as "the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the [[Biophysics|biophysical]], social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |title=Principle of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice |publisher=International Association for Impact Assessment |date=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507084339/http://www.iaia.org/publicdocuments/special-publications/Principles%20of%20IA_web.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs are unique in that they do not require adherence to a predetermined environmental outcome, but rather they require decision makers to [[environmental full-cost accounting|account for environmental values]] in their decisions and to justify those decisions in light of detailed environmental studies and public comments on the potential environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Holder, J., (2004), Environmental Assessment: The Regulation of Decision Making, Oxford University Press, New York; For a comparative discussion of the elements of various domestic EIA systems, see Christopher Wood Environmental Impact Assessment: A Comparative Review (2 ed, Prentice Hall, Harlow, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== History ==

Environmental impact assessments commenced in the 1960s, as part of increasing [[environmental awareness]].&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]  was established on 2 December 1970, in response to elevated concern about [[environmental pollution]].&lt;/ref&gt; EIAs involved a technical evaluation intended to contribute to more objective decision making. In the United States, environmental impact assessments obtained formal status in 1969, with enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]. EIAs have been used increasingly around the world. The number of "Environmental Assessments" filed every year "has vastly overtaken the number of more rigorous [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s (EIS)."{{sfn|Clark|Canter|1997|p=199}} An Environmental Assessment is a "mini-EIS designed to provide sufficient information to allow the agency to decide whether the preparation of a full-blown Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is necessary."{{sfn|Rychlak|Case|2010|p=111-120}}{{sfn|Kershner|2011}}
EIA is an activity that is done to find out the impact that would be done before development will occur.

== Methods ==
General and industry specific assessment methods are available including:

* ''Industrial products'' – Product environmental [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA) is used for identifying and measuring the impact of industrial products on the environment. These EIAs consider activities related to extraction of raw materials, ancillary materials, equipment; production, use, disposal and ancillary equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, S., Tsoulfas, G., Pappis, C., &amp; Rachaniotis, N. (2004) Aggregating and evaluating the results of different Environmental Impact Assessment methods Ecological indicators 4:125–138&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Genetically modified plants'' – Specific methods available to perform EIAs of [[genetically modified organisms]] include GMP-RAM and INOVA.&lt;ref&gt;Hitzschky, K., &amp; Silviera, J. (2009) A proposed impact assessment method for genetically modified plants (As-GMP method) Environmental Impact Assessment review 29: 348–368&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Fuzzy logic]]'' – EIA methods need measurement data to estimate values of impact indicators. However, many of the environment impacts cannot be quantified, e.g. landscape quality, lifestyle quality and social acceptance. Instead information from similar EIAs, expert judgment and community sentiment are employed. Approximate reasoning methods known as fuzzy logic can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Peche, R., &amp; Rodriguez, E., (2009) Environmental impact Assessment procedure: A new approach based on Fuzzy logic Environmental Impact Assessment review 29:275–283&lt;/ref&gt; A fuzzy arithmetic approach has also been proposed&lt;ref&gt;Duarte O. (2000) Técnicas Difusas en la Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental. Ph.D. Thesis, Universidad de Granada&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented using a software tool (TDEIA).&lt;ref&gt;ARAI Research Group, Granada, Spain. [http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ "Environmental Impact Assessment at University of Granada."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025165732/http://arai.ugr.es/eiadifusa/ |date=2014-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Follow-up ==
At the end of the project, an audit evaluates the accuracy of the EIA by comparing actual to predicted impacts. The objective is to make future EIAs more valid and effective. Two primary considerations are:
* ''Scientific'' – to examine the accuracy of predictions and explain errors
* ''Management'' – to assess the success of mitigation in reducing impacts

Audits can be performed either as a rigorous assessment of the [[null hypothesis]] or with a simpler approach comparing what actually occurred against the predictions in the EIA document.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, L., (1998), A Practical Method for Environmental Impact Assessment Audits Environ Impact Assess Rev 18: 59–71&lt;/ref&gt;

After an EIA, the [[Precautionary principle|precautionary]] and [[polluter pays principle]]s may be applied to decide whether to reject, modify or require [[strict liability]] or [[insurance]] coverage to a project, based on predicted harms.

The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is a sector specific method for checking the quality of Environmental and Social assessments and management plans.

== Around the world ==

=== Australia ===

The history of EIA in Australia could be linked to the enactment of the [[National Environmental Policy Act|U.S. National Environment Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1970, which made the preparation of environmental impact statements a requirement. In Australia, one might say that the EIA procedures were introduced at a State Level prior to that of the Commonwealth (Federal), with a majority of the states having divergent views to the Commonwealth. One of the pioneering states was New South Wales, whose State Pollution Control Commission issued EIA guidelines in 1974. At a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level, this was followed by passing of the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) in 1974. The ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) (EPBC Act) superseded the ''Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974'' (Cth) and is the current central piece for EIA in Australia on a Commonwealth (i.e. Federal) level. An important point to note is that this federal legislation does not override the validity of the States or Territories environmental and development assessments and approvals; rather the EPBC Act runs as a parallel to the State/Territory Systems.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;Elliott, M. &amp; Thomas, I. (2009), "Environment Impact Assessment in Australia: Theory and Practice, 5th Edn, Federation Press, Sydney"&lt;/ref&gt; Overlap between federal and state requirements is addressed via bilateral agreements or one-off accreditation of state processes, as provided for in the EPBC Act.

==== The Commonwealth Level ====

The EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places-defined in the EPBC Act as matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’. Following are the nine matters of ‘National Environmental Significance’ to which the EPBC Act applies:&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

* World Heritage properties;
* National Heritage places;
* Wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention);
* Listed threatened species and ecological communities;
* Migratory species protected under international agreements;
* Commonwealth marine areas;
* the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park;
* Nuclear actions (including uranium mining); and
* Water resources, in relation with coal seam gas development and large coal mining development.

In addition to this, the EPBC Act aims at providing a streamlined national assessment and approval process for activities. These activities could be by the Commonwealth, or its agents, anywhere in the world or activities on Commonwealth land; and activities that are listed as having a ‘significant impact’ on matters of ‘national environment significance'.&lt;ref name="department"&gt;{{citation|publisher=The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|location=Australia|title=The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|accessdate=9 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007230525/http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/|archivedate=7 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPBC Act comes into play when a person (a ‘proponent') wants an action (often called a ‘proposal’ or ‘project’) assessed for environmental impacts under the EPBC Act, he or she must refer the project to the Department of the Environment and Energy (Commonwealth). This ‘referral’ is then released to the public, as well as relevant state, territory and Commonwealth ministers, for comment on whether the project is likely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; The Department of the Environment and Energy assess the process and makes recommendation to the minister or the delegate for the feasibility. The final discretion on the decision remains of the minister, which is not solely based on matters of ‘national environmental significance’ but also the consideration of social and economic impact of the project.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

The Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Energy cannot intervene in a proposal if it has no significant impact on one of the eight matters of ‘national environmental significance’ despite the fact that there may be other undesirable environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt; This is primarily due to the division of powers between the States and the Federal government and due to which the Australian Government environment minister cannot overturn a state decision.

There are strict civil and criminal penalties for the breach of EPBC Act. Depending on the kind of breach, civil penalty (maximum) may go up to $550,000 for an individual and $5.5 million for a body corporate, or for criminal penalty (maximum) of seven years imprisonment and/or penalty of $46,200.&lt;ref name="department" /&gt;

==== The State and Territory Level ====

===== Australian Capital Territory (ACT) =====

EIA provisions within Ministerial Authorities in the ACT are found in the Chapters 7 and 8 of the ''Planning and Development Act 2007'' (ACT). EIA in ACT was previously administered with the help of Part 4 of the Land (Planning and Environment) Act 1991 (Land Act) and Territory Plan (plan for land-use).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;
Note that some EIA may occur in the ACT on Commonwealth land under the EPBC Act (Cth). Further provisions of the ''Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988'' (Cth) may also be applicable particularly to national land and "designated areas".

===== New South Wales (NSW) =====

In New South Wales, the ''Environment Planning and Assessment Act 1979'' (EP&amp;A Act) establishes two pathways for EIA. The first is under Division 5.2 of the EP&amp;A Act, which provides for EIA of 'State Significant Infrastructure' projects (from June 2011, this Part replaced the previous Part 3A, which previously covered EIA of major projects). The second is under Part 4 of the EP&amp;A Act dealing with development assessments for local, regional, and State Significant Developments (other than State Significant Infrastructure).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

===== Northern Territory (NT) =====
The EIA process in Northern Territory is chiefly administered under the Environmental Assessment Act (EAA).&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Territory Government, viewed 10 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; Although EAA is the primary tool for EIA in Northern Territory, there are further provisions for proposals in the Inquiries Act 1985 (NT).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Queensland (QLD)=====
There are four main EIA processes in Queensland.&lt;ref name=Defenders&gt;The Environment Defenders, viewed 10 September 2010, [http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf EDO factsheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716023121/http://www.edo.org.au/edoqld/edoqld/factsheets/factsheet11%2009.07.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) for development projects other than mining. Secondly, under the Chapter 3 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1994'' (Qld) (EP Act) for some mining and petroleum activities. Thirdly, under the ''State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971'' (Qld) (State Development Act) for ‘significant projects’. Finally, under the ''Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999'' (Cth) for ‘controlled actions’.&lt;ref name="Defenders" /&gt;

'''South Australia (SA)'''

The local governing tool for EIA in South Australia is the ''Development Act 1993'' (SA). There are three levels of assessment possible under the Act in the form of an environment impact statement (EIS), a public environmental report (PER) or a Development Report (DR).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Tasmania (TAS)=====
In Tasmania, an integrated system of legislation is used to govern development and approval process, this system is a mixture of the E''nvironmental Management and Pollution Control Act 1994'' (Tas) (EMPC Act), ''Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993'' (Tas) (LUPA Act), ''State Policies and Projects Act 1993'' (Tas) (SPPA), and ''Resource Management and Planning Appeals Tribunal Act 1993'' (Tas).&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

=====Victoria (VIC)=====
The EIA process in Victoria is intertwined with the ''[[Environment Effects Act 1978]]'' (Vic) and the Ministerial Guidelines for Assessment of Environmental Effects (made under the s 10 of the EE Act).&lt;ref&gt;The Law Handbook, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Australia (WA)=====
Part 4 of the ''Environmental Protection Act 1986'' (WA) provides the legislative framework for the EIA process in Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;The Government of Western Australia, viewed 9 September 2010,&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA Act oversees the planning and development proposals and assesses their likely impacts on the environment.

===Canada===
In ''Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transportation)'',{{harv|SCC|1992}} [[Gérard La Forest|La Forest J]] of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] described environmental impact assessment in terms of the proper scope of federal jurisdiction with respect to environments matters,{{quotation|"Environmental impact assessment is, in its simplest form, a planning tool that is now generally regarded as an integral component of sound decision-making."{{sfn|SCC|1992}}}}
[[Gérard La Forest|Supreme Court Justice La Forest]] cited {{harv|Cotton|Emond|1981|245}}, "The basic concepts behind environmental assessment are simply stated: (1) early identification and evaluation of all potential environmental consequences of a proposed undertaking; (2) decision making that both guarantees the adequacy of this process and reconciles, to the greatest extent possible, the proponent’s development desires with environmental protection and preservation."&lt;ref name="Cotton1981"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Cotton |last1=Roger|first2=D.

La Forest referred to {{harv|Jeffrey|1989||loc= 1.2,1.4}} and {{harv|Emond|1978|p=5}} who described "...environmental assessments as a planning tool with both an information-gathering and a decision-making component" that provide "...an objective basis for granting or denying approval for a proposed development."&lt;ref name="Jeffrey1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jeffery |first=Michael I.|title=Environmental Approvals in Canada|location=Toronto, Ontario|publisher=Butterworths|year=1989 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emond1978"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emond |first=D.

"The purposes of this Act are:
(a) to protect the components of the environment that are within the legislative authority of Parliament from significant adverse environmental effects caused by a designated project;
(b) to ensure that designated projects that require the exercise of a power or performance of a duty or function by a federal authority under any Act of Parliament other than this Act to be carried out, are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects;
(c) to promote cooperation and coordinated action between federal and provincial governments with respect to environmental assessments;
(d) to promote communication and cooperation with aboriginal peoples with respect to environmental assessments;
(e) to ensure that opportunities are provided for meaningful public participation during an environmental assessment;
(f) to ensure that an environmental assessment is completed in a timely manner;
(g) to ensure that projects, as defined in section 66, that are to be carried out on federal lands, or those that are outside Canada and that are to be carried out or financially supported by a federal authority, are considered in a careful and precautionary manner to avoid significant adverse environmental effects;
(h) to encourage federal authorities to take actions that promote sustainable development in order to achieve or maintain a healthy environment and a healthy economy; and

On 22 April 2013, Official Opposition Environment critic [[Megan Leslie]] issued a statement claiming that the federal government's recent changes to "fish habitat protection, the [[Navigable Waters Protection Act]] and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act", along with gutting existing laws and making cuts to science and research, "will be disastrous, not only for the environment, but also for Canadians’ health and economic prosperity."&lt;ref name="NDP22apr2013"&gt;{{cite news|date=22 April 2013|title=Statement by Official Opposition Environment critic Megan Leslie on Earth Day|url=https://www.ndp.ca/news/statement-official-opposition-environment-critic-megan-leslie-earth-day|publisher=NDP|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621121734/http://www.ndp.ca/news/statement-official-opposition-environment-critic-megan-leslie-earth-day|archivedate=21 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 September 2012, Leslie argued that with the changes to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act that came into effect 6 July 2012, "seismic testing, dams, wind farms and power plants" no longer required any federal environmental assessment. She also claimed that because the CEAA 2012—which she claimed was rushed through Parliament—dismantled the CEAA 1995, the Oshawa ethanol plant project would no longer have a full federal environmental assessment.&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012"&gt;{{cite parl|date=26 September 2012|title=Question period|location=Ottawa, ON|author=Megan Leslie|url=http://openparliament.ca/debates/2012/9/26/megan-leslie-1/|publisher=Open Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Peter Kent (Minister of the Environment) explained that the CEAA 2012 "provides for the Government of Canada and the Environmental Assessment Agency to focus on the large and most significant projects that are being proposed across the country." The 2,000 to 3,000-plus smaller screenings that were in effect under CEAA 1995 became the "responsibility of lower levels of government but are still subject to the same strict federal environmental laws."&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012" /&gt; Anne Minh-Thu Quach, MP for Beauharnois—Salaberry, QC, argued that the mammoth budget bill dismantled 50 years of environmental protection without consulting Canadians about the "colossal changes they are making to environmental assessments." She claimed that the federal government is entering into "limited consultations, by invitation only, months after the damage was done."&lt;ref name="Leslie26sep2012" /&gt;

===China===
The Environmental Impact Assessment Law (EIA Law) requires that an environmental impact assessment be completed prior to project construction. However, if a developer completely ignores this requirement and builds a project without submitting an environmental impact statement, the only penalty is that the environmental protection bureau (EPB) may require the developer to do a make-up environmental assessment. If the developer does not complete this make-up assessment within the designated time, only then is the EPB authorized to fine the developer. Even so, the possible fine is capped at a maximum of about US$25,000, a fraction of the overall cost of most major projects. The lack of more stringent enforcement mechanisms has resulted in a significant percentage of projects not completing legally required environmental impact assessments prior to construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Wang| first=Alex| authorlink=| coauthors=| title=Environmental protection in China: the role of law| work=| publisher=| date=2007-02-05| url=http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| format=| doi=| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516123917/http://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/745-Environmental-protection-in-China-the-role-of-law| archivedate=2012-05-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's [[State Environmental Protection Administration]] (SEPA) used the legislation to halt 30 projects in 2004, including three hydro-power plants under the [[Three Gorges]] Project Company. Although one month later (Note as a point of reference, that the typical EIA for a major project in the USA takes one to two years.), most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction, reportedly having passed the environmental assessment, the fact that these key projects' construction was ever suspended was notable.

A joint investigation by SEPA and the Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 showed that 30–40% of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required, while in some areas only 6–7% did so. This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years.

SEPA alone cannot guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations, observed Professor [[Wang Canfa]], director of the centre to help environmental victims at [[China University of Political Science and Law]]. In fact, according to Wang, the rate of China's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated at barely 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Egypt ===
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
EIA is implemented in Egypt under the umbrella of the Ministry of state for environmental affairs. The Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) is responsible for the EIA services.

In June 1997, the responsibility of Egypt's first full-time Minister of State for Environmental Affairs was assigned as stated in the Presidential Decree no.275/1997. From thereon, the new ministry has focused, in close collaboration with the national and international development partners, on defining environmental policies, setting priorities and implementing initiatives within a context of sustainable development.

According to the Law 4/1994 for the Protection of the Environment, the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA) was restructured with the new mandate to substitute the institution initially established in 1982. At the central level, EEAA represents the executive arm of the Ministry.

The purpose of EIA is to ensure the protection and conservation of the environment and natural resources including human health aspects against uncontrolled development. The long-term objective is to ensure a sustainable economic development that meets present needs without compromising future generations ability to meet their own needs. EIA is an important tool in the integrated environmental management approach.

EIA must be performed for new establishments or projects and for expansions or renovations of existing establishments according to the Law for the Environment.

The directive was amended again in 2003, following EU signature of the 1998 [[Aarhus Convention]], and once more in 2009. The initial Directive of 1985 and its three amendments have been codified in Directive 2011/92/EU of 13 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2012:026:0001:0021:EN:PDF DIRECTIVE 2011/92/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 13 December 2011 on the assessment of the effects of some public and private projects on the environment] from [http://eur-lex.europa.eu Eur-Lex] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907140138/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/ |date=2017-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, the issue was enlarged to the assessment of plans and programmes by the so-called ''[[Strategic Environmental Assessment|Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)]] Directive'' (2001/42/EC), which is now in force.&lt;ref name="watson" /&gt;
Under the EU directive, an EIA must provide certain information to comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0042:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex – 32001L0042 – EN|author=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven key areas that are required:
# Description of the project
#* Description of actual project and site description
#* Break the project down into its key components, i.e. construction, operations, decommissioning
#* For each component list all of the sources of environmental disturbance
#* For each component all the inputs and outputs must be listed, e.g., [[air pollution]], noise, [[hydrology]]
# Alternatives that have been considered
#* Examine alternatives that have been considered
#* Example: in a [[biomass]] power station, will the fuel be sourced locally or nationally?
# Description of the environment
#* List of all aspects of the environment that may be affected by the development
#* Example: populations, [[fauna]], flora, air, soil, water, humans, landscape, cultural heritage
#* This section is best carried out with the help of local experts, e.g. the [[RSPB]] in the UK
# Description of the significant effects on the environment
#* The word significant is crucial here as the definition can vary
#* 'Significant' must be defined
#* The most frequent method used here is use of the [[Leopold matrix]]
#* The matrix is a tool used in the systematic examination of potential interactions
#* Example: in a windfarm development a significant impact may be collisions with birds
# Mitigation
#* This is where EIA is most useful
#* Once section 4 is complete, it is obvious where impacts are greatest
#* Using this information ways to avoid negative impacts should be developed
#* Best working with the developer with this section as they know the project best
#* Using the windfarm example again, construction could be out of bird nesting seasons.  Or removal of hardstanding on a potentially contaminated land site, out of the rainy season.
# Non-technical summary (EIS)
#* The EIA is in the public domain and be used in the decision making process
#* It is important that the information is available to the public
#* This section is a summary that does not include jargon or complicated diagrams
#* It should be understood by the informed lay-person
# Lack of know-how/technical difficulties
#* This section is to advise any areas of weakness in knowledge
#* It can be used to focus areas of future research
#* Some developers see the EIA as a starting block for poor environmental management

====Annexed projects====
All projects are either classified as Annex 1 or Annex 2 projects. Those lying in Annex 1 are large scale developments such as motorways, chemical works, bridges, powerstations etc. These always require an EIA under the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85,337,EEC as amended). Annex 2 projects are smaller in scale than those referred to in Annex 1. Member States must determine whether these project shall be made subject to an assessment subject to a set of criteria set out in Annex 3 of codified Directive 2011/92/EU.

====The Netherlands====
EIA was implemented in Dutch legislation on September 1, 1987. The categories of projects that require an EIA are summarised in Dutch legislation, the Wet milieubeheer. The use of thresholds for activities makes sure that EIA is obligatory for those activities that may have considerable impacts on the environment.

For projects and plans that fit these criteria, an EIA report is required. The EIA report defines a.o. the proposed initiative, it makes clear the impact of that initiative on the environment and compares this with the impact of possible alternatives with less a negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf List of criteria for EIA/SEA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724151830/http://docs1.eia.nl/cms/engelse_c-d-lijsten.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
EIA in Hong Kong, since 1998, is regulated by the ''Environmental Impact Assessment Ordinance 1997''.

The original proposal to construct the [[Lok Ma Chau Spur Line]] overground across the [[Long Valley, Hong Kong|Long Valley]] failed to get through EIA, and the [[Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation]] had to change its plan and build the railway underground. In April 2011, the EIA of the Hong Kong section of the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] was found to have breached the ordinance, and was declared unlawful. The appeal by the government was allowed in September 2011. However, it was estimated that this EIA court case had increased the construction cost of the Hong Kong section of the bridge by HK$6.5 billion in money-of-the-day prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |title=LCQ1: Judicial review case regarding the Environmental Impact Assessment reports of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge |author= |date=October 26, 2011 |work=Press Releases |publisher=www.info.gov.hk |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119072107/http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201110/26/P201110260238.htm |archivedate=January 19, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iraq ===
Ministry of Environment of the federal government of Iraq is in charge of issuing Environmental compliance certificate based on an EIA report prepared by professional consultant and thoroughly reviewed by MOE. Any project or activity prior to its establishment or even already existing project has to be approved and obtain such certificate from the MOE. Projects are classified into 3 categories; “A”, “B” and “C”. EIA report is usually obligatory for those projects and activities falling under categories “A” (large-scale) and “B” (small-scale) that may have considerable impacts on environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|title=EIA process in Iraq|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221814/https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/env/eia/documents/WG14_MOS3_nov2010/Diagram_EIA_process_in_Iraq.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of “A” category activities such as: dams and reservoirs, forestry production projects, industrial plants, irrigation, drainage and flood control, land clearance and leveling, port and harbor development, river basin development, thermal power and hydro-power development, manufacture, transportation and use of pesticides or other hazardous materials, hazardous waste management and disposal....etc. An example of “B” category activities such as: agro-industries, electrical transmission, renewable energy, rural electrification, tourism, rehabilitation or maintenance of highway or rural roads, rehabilitation or modification of existing industrial facilities...etc. preparation of EIA report is usually exempt for projects falling under category “C” that may have low to no impact on environment, and example of “C” category activities: small fish breeding pond, institutional development, most human resources projects...etc.

The main environmental legislations in Iraq are: Law No.64 for cities and land use (1965), Law No.21 for noise prevention (1966), Law No.25 for system of rivers and other water resources protection (1967), Law No.99 for ionized radiation (1980), Law No.89 for public health (drinking water provision, sanitation and environmental monitoring (1981), Law No.79 for protection and improvement of environment (1986), Environmental criteria for agricultural, industrial and public service projects (1990), Law No.3 for protection and improvement of environment (1997), Law No.2 for water systems protection (2001), Law No.44 for creation of Ministry of Environment instead of the council of protection and improvement of environment (2003), Law No.27 for environmental protection and improvement (2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|title=Law No.27 of 2009 for protection and improvement of environment|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901160232/http://extwprlegs1.fao.org/docs/pdf/irq100188E.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Law No.4 for protection of ambient air system (2012).

The [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change]] (MoEFCC) of India has been in a great effort in Environmental Impact Assessment in India. The main laws in action are the Water Act(1974), the Indian [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972|Wildlife (Protection) Act (1972)]], the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1981) and the Environment (Protection) Act (1986),Biological Diversity Act(2002).&lt;ref&gt;Shibani Ghosh, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf "Demystifying the Environmental Clearance Process in India"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221023322/http://nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2013_3/03shibanighosh.pdf |date=2015-02-21 }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The responsible body for this is the Central Pollution Control Board.
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies need a significant amount of primary and secondary environmental data. Primary data are those collected in the field to define the status of the environment (like air quality data, water quality data etc.). Secondary data are those collected over the years that can be used to understand the existing environmental scenario of the study area. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies are conducted over a short period of time and therefore the understanding of the environmental trends, based on a few months of primary data, has limitations. Ideally, the primary data must be considered along with the secondary data for complete understanding of the existing environmental status of the area. In many EIA studies, the secondary data needs could be as high as 80% of the total data requirement. EIC is the repository of one stop secondary data source for environmental impact assessment in India.

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) experience in India indicates that the lack of timely availability of reliable and authentic environmental data has been a major bottle neck in achieving the full benefits of EIA. The environment being a multi-disciplinary subject, a multitude of agencies are involved in collection of environmental data. However, no single organization in India tracks available data from these agencies and makes it available in one place in a form required by environmental impact assessment practitioners. Further, environmental data is not available in enhanced forms that improve the quality of the EIA. This makes it harder and more time-consuming to generate environmental impact assessments and receive timely environmental clearances from regulators. With this background, the Environmental Information Centre (EIC) has been set up to serve as a professionally managed clearing house of environmental information that can be used by MoEF, project proponents, consultants, NGOs and other stakeholders involved in the process of environmental impact assessment in India. EIC caters to the need of creating and disseminating of organized environmental data for various developmental initiatives all over the country.

EIC stores data in GIS format and makes it available to all environmental impact assessment studies and to EIA stakeholders in a cost effective and timely manner. So that we can manage that in different proportions such as remedy measures etc.,

In Malaysia, Section 34A, Environmental Quality Act, 1974&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014734/http://www.doe.gov.my/portal/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Appendix_1.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; requires developments that have significant impact to the environment are required to conduct the Environmental impact assessment.

=== Nepal ===
In Nepal, EIA has been integrated in major development projects since the early 1980s. In the planning history of Nepal, the sixth plan (1980–85), for the first time, recognized the need for EIA with the establishment of Environmental Impact Study Project (EISP) under the Department of Soil Conservation in 1982 to develop necessary instruments for integration of EIA in infrastructure
development projects. However, the government of Nepal enunciated environment conservation related
policies in the seventh plan (NPC, 1985–1990). To enforce this policy and make necessary arrangements, a series of guidelines were developed, thereby incorporating the elements of environmental factors right from the project formulation stage of the development plans
and projects and to avoid or minimize adverse effects on the ecological system. In addition, it has also emphasized that EIAs of industry, tourism, water resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental projects be conducted.

In Nepal, the government's Environmental Impact Assessment Guideline of 1993 inspired the enactment of the Environment Protection Act (EPA) of 1997 and the Environment Protection Rules (EPR) of 1997 (EPA and EPR have been enforced since 24 and 26 June 1997 respectively in Nepal) to internalizing the environmental assessment system. The process institutionalized the EIA process in development proposals and enactment, which makes the integration of IEE and EIA legally binding to the prescribed projects. The projects, requiring EIA or IEE, are included in Schedules 1 and 2 of the EPR, 1997
(GoN/MoLJPA 1997).

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, EIA is usually referred to as ''Assessment of Environmental Effects'' (AEE).  The first use of EIA's dates back to a Cabinet minute passed in 1974 called Environmental Protection and Enhancement Procedures. This had no legal force and only related to the activities of government departments. When the [[Resource Management Act 1991|Resource Management Act]] was passed in 1991, an EIA was required as part of a resource consent application. Section 88 of the Act specifies that the AEE must include "such detail as corresponds with the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment".  While there is no duty to consult any person when making a resource consent application (Sections 36A and Schedule 4), proof of consultation is almost certain required by local councils when they decide whether or not to publicly notify the consent application under Section 93.

=== Russian Federation ===
As of 2004, the state authority responsible for conducting the State EIA in Russia has been split between two Federal bodies: 1) Federal service for monitoring the use of natural resources – a part of the Russian Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment and 2) Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control. The two main pieces of environmental legislation in Russia are: The Federal Law ‘On Ecological Expertise, 1995 and the ‘Regulations on Assessment of Impact from Intended Business and Other Activity on Environment in the Russian Federation, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Environmental Protection, Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal Service for monitoring the use of natural resources ====
In 2006, the parliament committee on ecology in conjunction with the Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment, created a working group to prepare a number of amendments to existing legislation to cover such topics as stringent project documentation for building of potentially environmentally damaging objects as well as building of projects on the territory of protected areas.
There has been some success in this area, as evidenced from abandonment of plans to construct a gas pipe-line through the only remaining habitat of the critically endangered Amur leopard in the Russian Far East.

==== Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control ====
The government's decision to hand over control over several important procedures, including state EIA in the field of all types of energy projects, to the Federal Service for Ecological, Technological and Nuclear Control had caused a major controversy and criticism from environmental groups that blamed the government for giving nuclear power industry control over the state EIA.

Not surprisingly the main problem concerning State EIA in Russia is the clear differentiation of jurisdiction between the two above-mentioned Federal bodies.

=== Sri Lanka ===

The National Environmental Act, 1998 requires environmental impact assessment for large scale projects in sensitive areas. It is enforced by the Central Environmental Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Central Environmental Authority|title=Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedure in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|website=Central Environmental Authority|publisher=Central Environmental Authority|accessdate=1 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103215340/http://www.cea.lk/web/index.php/en/environmental-impact-assessment-eia-procedure-in-sri-lanka|archivedate=3 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new law of Ukraine on evaluation of impact on surroundings prescribes the requirements of environmental safety, rational use of national resources, minimizing of harmful impact on surroundings in the process of making managerial decisions about planned activity. The designing of the conclusion of evaluation of impact is a result of its conducting. The key moment of the law on evaluation of impact on surroundings is a substitution of conclusion of state environmental experise on the conclusion of evaluation of impact on surroundings. Business entity is forbidden to conduct or to start its planned activity without the conclusion of impact on surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MCL LLC|title=Evaluation of impact on surroundings|url=http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|website=MCL LLC|publisher=Eric Firado|accessdate=1 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043929/http://www.mcl.kiev.ua/en/evaluation-of-impact-on-surroundings-2/|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|National Environmental Policy Act}}
The [[National Environmental Policy Act]] of 1969 (NEPA), enacted in 1970, established a policy of environmental impact assessment for federal agency actions, federally funded activities or federally permitted/licensed activities that in the U. S. is termed "environmental review" or simply "the NEPA process."&lt;ref&gt;United States. National Environmental Policy Act, [http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm P.L. 91-190] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516090600/http://www.usinfo.org/enus/government/branches/nepaeqia.htm |date=2013-05-16 }}, {{USStat|83|852|1969}}, {{USC|42|4321}} ''et seq.'' Approved January 1, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; The law also created the [[Council on Environmental Quality]], which promulgated regulations to codify the law's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Council on Environmental Quality. "NEPA and Agency Planning." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{USCFR|40|1501}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[United States environmental law]] an Environmental Assessment (EA) is compiled to determine the need for an ''[[Environmental Impact Statement]]'' (EIS).  Federal or federalized actions expected to subject or be subject to significant environmental impacts will publish a Notice of Intent to Prepare an EIS as soon as significance is known.  Certain actions of [[federal government of the United States|federal]] [[government agency|agencies]] must be preceded by the NEPA process.  Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, nor does it specify any penalty if an environmental impact assessment turns out to be inaccurate, intentionally or otherwise.  NEPA requires that plausible statements as to the prospective impacts be disclosed in advance. The purpose of NEPA process is to ensure that the decision maker is fully informed of the environmental aspects and consequences prior to making the final decision.

==== Environmental assessment ====
An '''environmental assessment''' (EA) is an environmental analysis prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act to determine whether a federal action would significantly affect the environment and thus require a more detailed ''Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)''. The certified release of an Environmental Assessment results in either a ''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)'' or an [[Environmental Impact Statement|EIS]].&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. and J. Peyton Doub (2010). [https://www.amazon.com/Preparing-NEPA-Environmental-Assessments-Professional/dp/1439808821/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486949351&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=charles+eccleston Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User’s Guide to Best Professional Practices]. {{ISBN|978-1439808825}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), which oversees the administration of NEPA, issued regulations for implementing the NEPA in 1979. Eccleston reports that the NEPA regulations barely mention preparation of EAs. This is because the EA was originally intended to be a simple document used in relatively rare instances where an agency was not sure if the potential significance of an action would be sufficient to trigger preparation of an EIS. But today, because EISs are so much longer and complicated to prepare, federal agencies are going to great effort to avoid preparing EISs by using EAs, even in cases where the use of EAs may be inappropriate. The ratio of EAs that are being issued compared to EISs is about 100 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eccleston |first1=Charles |last2=Doub |first2=J. Peyton |year=2012 |title=Preparing NEPA Environmental Assessments: A User's Guide to Best Professional Practices |location= |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439808825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, even the preparation of an accurate EA is viewed today as an onerous burden by many entities responsible for the environmental review of a proposal. Federal agencies have responded by streamlining their regulations that implement NEPA environmental review, by defining categories of projects that by their well understood nature may be safely excluded from review under NEPA, and by drawing up lists of project types that have negligible material impact upon the environment and can thus be exempted.

===== Content =====
The Environmental Assessment is a concise public document prepared by the federal action agency that serves to:
# briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
# Demonstrate compliance with the act when no EIS is required
# facilitate the preparation of an EIS when a FONSI cannot be demonstrated

The Environmental Assessment includes a brief discussion of the purpose and need of the proposal and of its alternatives as required by NEPA 102(2)(E), and of the human environmental impacts resulting from and occurring to the proposed actions and alternatives considered practicable, plus a listing of studies conducted and agencies and stakeholders consulted to reach these conclusions.  The action agency must approve an EA before it is made available to the public. The EA is made public through notices of availability by local, state, or regional clearing houses, often triggered by the purchase of a public notice advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed activity area.

===== Structure =====
The structure of a generic Environmental Assessment is as follows:
# Summary
# Introduction
#* Background
#* Purpose and Need for Action
#* Proposed Action
#* Decision Framework
#* Public Involvement
#* Issues
# Alternatives, including the Proposed Action
#* Alternatives
#* Mitigation Common to All Alternatives
#* Comparison of Alternatives
# Environmental Consequences
# Consultation and Coordination

===== Procedure =====
The EA becomes a draft public document when notice of it is published, usually in a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the proposal. There is a 15-day review period required for an Environmental Assessment (30 days if exceptional circumstances) while the document is made available for public commentary, and a similar time for any objection to improper process. Commenting on the Draft EA is typically done in writing or email, submitted to the lead action agency as published in the notice of availability. An EA does not require a public hearing for verbal comments.  Following the mandated public comment period, the lead action agency responds to any comments, and certifies either a FONSI or a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS in its public environmental review record.  The preparation of an EIS then generates a similar but more lengthy, involved and expensive process.

==== Environmental impact statement ====
{{main|Environmental impact statement}}
The adequacy of an environmental impact statement (EIS) can be challenged in [[United States federal courts|federal court]].  Major proposed projects have been blocked because of an agency's failure to prepare an acceptable EIS.  One prominent example was the [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] landfill and highway development in and along the [[Hudson River]] in [[New York, New York|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm ''Sierra Club v. United States Army Corps of Engineers,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040328074514/http://www.elr.info/litigation/vol13/13.20326.htm |date=2004-03-28 }}
701 F.2d 1011, 18 ERC 1748. (2d Cir., 02/25/1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent case involved the [[Sierra Club]] suing the [[Nevada Department of Transportation]] over its denial of the club's request to issue a supplemental EIS addressing air emissions of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] and hazardous [[air pollutants]] in the case of widening [[U.S. Route 95 in Nevada|U.S. Route 95]] through [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ritter |first=John |title=Lawsuit pits risks and roads |publisher=USA Today |date=2003-06-03 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |accessdate= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629064153/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-03-06-vegas-highway-usat_x.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case reached the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], which led to construction on the highway being halted until the court's final decision. The case was settled prior to the court's final decision.

Several [[State governments of the United States|state governments]] that have adopted "little NEPAs," [[state law]]s imposing EIS requirements for particular state actions. Some of those state laws such as the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] refer to the required environmental impact study as an '''environmental impact report'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |title=Sive,D. &amp; Chertok,M., "Little NEPAs" and Environmental Impact Assessment Procedures |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004091103/http://www.sprlaw.com/pdf/spr_little_nepa_ali_aba_0605.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This variety of state requirements produces voluminous data not just upon impacts of individual projects, but also in insufficiently researched scientific domains. For example, in a seemingly routine ''Environmental Impact Report'' for the city of [[Monterey, California]], information came to light that led to the official federal endangered species listing of [[Hickman's potentilla]], a rare coastal [[wildflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogers|first1=Mark|title=Endangered Flora of California|publisher=lulu.com|ISBN=978-1312862784|page=106|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O17xCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106&amp;dq=C.M.+Hogan,+G.+Deghi,+M.+Papineau+et+al.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZKZSMO9-Y6&amp;sig=gezVDrq4tzoDHNmrQfNjAXjcguw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi7-KmQsMTQAhXP0RoKHRzOBAUQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=C.M.%20Hogan%2C%20G.%20Deghi%2C%20M.%20Papineau%20et%20al.&amp;f=false|accessdate=November 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan, G. Deghi, M. Papineau et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Pebble Beach Properties project by Del Monte Forest'', Earth Metrics Inc. Prepared for the city of Monterey and State of California Clearinghouse (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. [[Federal Register]]: August 2, 1995 (Volume 60, Number 148, Pages 39326-39337)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transboundary application ==
Environmental threats do not respect national borders. International pollution can have detrimental effects on the atmosphere, oceans, rivers, [[aquifer]]s, farmland, the weather and biodiversity. Global climate change is transnational. Specific pollution threats include [[acid rain]], [[radioactive contamination]], [[Space debris|debris in outer space]], [[Stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] and toxic [[oil spill]]s. The [[Chernobyl disaster]], precipitated by a [[Nuclear and radiation accidents|nuclear accident]] on April 26, 1986, is a stark reminder of the devastating effects of transboundary nuclear pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, P., (1989), The Environment, Community and International Law, Harvard International Law Lournal, 393, p402&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental protection is inherently a cross-border issue and has led to the creation of transnational regulation via multilateral and bilateral treaties. The [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (UNCHE or Stockholm Conference) held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972 and the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development]] (UNCED or Rio Summit, Rio Conference, or Earth Summit) held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1992 were key in the creation of about 1,000 international instruments that include at least some provisions related to the environment and its protection.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, E., (1999), Understanding Compliance with International Environmental Agreements: The Bakers Dozen Myths, Univ Richmond L.R. 32, 1555&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's]] [[Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context]] was negotiated to provide an international legal framework for transboundary EIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |title=Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo, 1991) |publisher=Unece.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126142541/http://www.unece.org/env/eia/welcome.html |archivedate=2013-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as there is no universal legislature or administration with a comprehensive mandate, most international treaties exist parallel to one another and are further developed without the benefit of consideration being given to potential conflicts with other agreements. There is also the issue of international enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfrum, R., &amp; Matz, N., (2003), Conflicts in International Environmental Law, Max-Planck-Institut für Ausländisches Öffentliches Recht und Völkerrech&lt;/ref&gt;
This has led to duplications and failures, in part due to an inability to enforce agreements. An example is the failure of many international 
fisheries regimes to restrict harvesting practises.&lt;ref&gt;Young, O., (1999), The Effectiveness of International Environmental Regimes, [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Application shall be achieved by the willing of counties authorities. / Aphro10

== Criticism ==
As per Jay ''et al.'', EIA is used as a decision aiding tool rather than decision making tool. There is growing dissent about them as their influence on decisions is limited. Improved training for practitioners, guidance on bestpractice and continuing research have all been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jay |first1=S. |last2=Jones |first2=C. |last3=Slinn |first3=P. |last4=Wood |first4=C. |year=2007 |title=Environmental Impact Assessment: Retrospect and Prospect |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1016/j.eiar.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EIAs have been criticized for excessively limiting their scope in space and time. No accepted procedure exists for determining such boundaries. The boundary refers to ‘the spatial and temporal boundary of the proposal’s effects’. This boundary is determined by the applicant and the lead assessor, but in practice, almost all EIAs address only direct and immediate on-site effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenzen |first1=M. |last2=Murray |first2=S. |last3=Korte |first3=B. |last4=Dey |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Environmental impact assessment including indirect effects—a case study using input-output analysis |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=263–282 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00104-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development causes both direct and indirect effects. Consumption of goods and services, production, use and disposal of building materials and machinery, additional land use for activities of manufacturing and services, mining and refining, etc., all have environmental impacts. The indirect effects of development can be much higher than the direct effects examined by an EIA. Proposals such as [[airports]] or [[shipyards]] cause wide-ranging national and international effects, which should be covered in EIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shepherd |first1=A. |last2=Ortolano |first2=L. |year=1996 |title=Strategic environmental assessment for sustainable urban development |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=16 |issue=4–6 |pages=321–335 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(96)00071-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadening the scope of EIA can benefit the conservation of threatened species. Instead of concentrating on the project site, some EIAs employed a [[habitat]]-based approach that focused on much broader relationships among humans and the environment. As a result, alternatives that reduce the negative effects to the population of whole species, rather than local subpopulations, can be assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=João P. |year=2000 |title=EIA procedure, Landscape ecology and conservation management—Evaluation of alternatives in a highway EIA process |url= |journal=Environmental Impact Assessment Review |publisher=Elsevier |volume=20 |issue=6 |pages=665–680 |doi=10.1016/S0195-9255(00)00060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this, Maier et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier  |first1=HR |last2=Ascough  |first2=JC |last3=Wattenbach  |first3=M |last4=Renschler  |first4=CS |last5=Labiosa   |first5=WB |year=2008 |title=Uncertainty in Environmental Decision Making: Issues, Challenges and Future Directions |url= |journal=Publications from USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty. Paper 399.|publisher=USDA-ARS/UNL Faculty |volume= |issue= |pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have concluded on the need to consider uncertainty at all stages of the decision-making process. In such a way decisions can be made with confidence or known uncertainty. These proposals are justified on data that shows that environmental assessments fail to predict accurately the impacts observed. Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tenney   |first1=A |last2=Kværner   |first2=J |last3=Gjerstad   |first3=KI |year=2006 |title=Uncertainty in environmental impact assessment predictions: the need for better communication and more transparency|url= |journal=Impact Assessment and Project Appraisal| publisher=|volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=45–56|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wood et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wood    |first1=C |last2=, Dipper |first2=B |last3= Jones    |first3=C |year=2000 |title=Auditing the assessments of the environmental impacts of planning projects|url= |journal=Journal of Environmental Planning and Management| publisher=|volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=23–47|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have reported evidence of the intrinsic uncertainty attached to EIAs predictions from a number of case studies worldwide. The gathered evidence consisted of comparisons between predictions in EIAs and the impacts measured during, or following project implementation. In explaining this trend, Tenney et al.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; have highlighted major causes such as project changes, modelling errors, errors in data and assumptions taken and bias introduced by people in the projects analyzed.

The '''Euchologium Sinaiticum''' is a 109-folio [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic#Canon|Canon of Old Church Slavonic]] [[euchologium]]. It contains parts of the liturgy of the St. [[John Chrysostom]], and is dated to the 11th century.

== Manuscripts ==
Part of the manuscript was found in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], [[Egypt]] in 1850 by the Russian [[archimandrite]] [[Porphyrius Uspensky]] ([[#SinSl37|Sin. slav. 37]]), and there it's still kept today excepting the three folios taken by Uspenskij and N.P. Krylov to Saint Petersburg, Russia ([[National Library of Russia|NLR]] Ms. глаг. 2 &amp; 3). Among the Sinai manuscripts discovered in 1975 is a 28-folio fragment of the Euchologium Sinaiticum (Sin. slav. 1/N).

== Editions ==
It was first published by Czech L. Geitler in 1882 in Zagreb. In the edition ''[[Patrologia Orientalis]]'' (t. XXIV, fasc. 5, 1933, p. 605-802 and t. XXV, fasc. 3, 1939, p. 487-617) it was published by J. Frček. Slovene Slavist R. Nahtigal published a facsimile edition it in Ljubljana in 1941, and in 1942 in a Cyrillic transcription. A facsimile edition of the recent discoveries of Euchologium fragmenta has been published by I. C. Tarnanidis: ''The Slavonic Manuscripts Discovered in 1975. at St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai'' (Thessaloniki, 1988).

== Context ==
Researchers emphasize that the manuscript is a collection of diverse prayers of different origins: some of them are scribed to the pre-Cyrillo-Methodian Salzburg mission, and for others it's being claimed that they represent Eastern-rite missal fragments. We don't know much of its language: nasal vowels are well-preserved, there is no notation of palatalism in syllabic sonorants ''r'' and ''l'', strong [[yer]]s are sometimes preserved, and sometimes vocalized (''ъ'' &gt; ''o'', ''ь'' &gt; ''e''), weak yers are sometimes omitted, [[Jagić's rule]] is confirmed etc.

A '''forb''' (sometimes spelled '''phorb''') is an [[herbaceous]] [[flowering plant]] that is not a [[graminoid]] ([[Poaceae|grasses]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]] and [[Juncaceae|rushes]]). The term is used in biology and in vegetation [[ecology]], especially in relation to [[grassland]]s&lt;ref name="isbn1-60692-024-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schröder, Hans |title=Grasslands: Ecology, Management and Restoration |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |location=Commack, N.Y |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=1-60692-024-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[understory]].

==Etymology==

"Forb" is derived from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] φορβή (''phorbḗ''), "[[pasture]]" or "[[fodder]]".&lt;ref name="isbn0-398-06179-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaeger, Edmund C. |authorlink=Edmund Jaeger |title=A source-book of biological names and terms |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1959 |pages= |isbn=0-398-06179-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn1-84356-026-7"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Scott, Robert Pickett |author2=Henry, George |title=Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, Abridged: Original Edition, republished in larger and clearer typeface |publisher=Simon Wallenburg Press |location= |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-84356-026-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spelling "phorb" is sometimes used, and in older usage this sometimes includes [[graminid]]s and other plants currently not regarded as forbs.

==Forbs and guilds==

Forbs are members of a [[Guild (ecology)|guild]] – a group of plant species with broadly similar growth form. In certain contexts in ecology, guild membership may often be more important than the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] relationships between organisms.

==Forbs in informal classification==
In addition to its use in ecology, the term "forb" may be used for subdividing popular guides to [[wildflower]]s, distinguishing them from other categories such as grasses, sedges, [[shrub]]s, and [[tree]]s.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

Some examples of forbs are [[clover]], [[sunflower]], [[daylily]], and [[Asclepias|milkweed]].

'''Friedrich August Krubsacius''' (21 March 1718  - 28 November 1789) was a German architect, teacher, and [[architectural theoretician]].&lt;ref name="Purdy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel L.

He was born at [[Dresden]]. In 1755 he was made court architect to the [[Electorate of Saxony]], in 1764 professor of architecture at the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]] and in 1776 chief architect of Saxony.

The work of Krubascius include palaces for [[Johann Georg, Chevalier de Saxe]], and the [[Landhaus (Dresden)|Landhaus]] of [[Dresden]], completed in 1776 and now housing the [[Dresden City Museum]].  Among his students were [[Gottlob Friedrich Thormeyer]] and [[Christian Friedrich Schuricht]].

[[File:Amplifier Compression.gif|thumb|Power transfer curves for an amplifier with a gain of 3 (4.77&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]]). The green curve represents an ideal amplifier, in which the output power is equal to 3 times the input power. The red curve represents a typical amplifier, which can deliver the gain only up to a certain power level before it hits saturation. Gain compression is the difference between the green curve and the red curve.]]

'''Gain compression''' is a reduction in "differential" or "slope" gain caused by [[nonlinearity]] of the [[transfer function]] of the amplifying device. This nonlinearity may be caused by heat due to power dissipation or by [[overdrive (music)|overdriving]] the active device beyond its [[linear]] region. It is a ''[[Large-signal model|large-signal]]'' phenomenon of circuits.

== Relevance ==
[[Gain (electronics)|Gain]] compression is relevant in any system with a wide dynamic range, such as audio or [[Radio frequency|RF]].  It is more common in [[vacuum tube|tube]] circuits than [[transistor]] circuits, due to topology differences, possibly causing the differences in audio performance called "[[Tube sound|valve sound]]". The front-end RF [[amplifier|amps]] of [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]]s are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon when overloaded by a strong unwanted signal.

== Audio effects ==

A tube radio or tube amplifier will increase in volume to a point, and then as the input signal extends beyond the [[linear]] range of the device, the effective gain is reduced, altering the shape of the waveform.  The effect is also present in transistor circuits.  The extent of the effect depends on the topology of the amplifier.

== Differences between clipping and compression ==

Clipping, as a form of signal compression, differs from the operation of the typical studio [[audio level compression|audio level compressor]], in which gain compression is not instantaneous (delayed in time via attack and release settings). 

Clipping destroys any audio information which is over a certain threshold. Compression and limiting change the shape of the entire waveform, not just the shape of the waveform above the threshold. This is why it is possible to limit and compress with very high ratios without causing distortion.

=== Limiting or clipping ===

Gain is a linear operation. "Gain compression" is not linear and, as such, its effect is one of distortion, due to the [[nonlinearity]] of the transfer characteristic which also causes a loss of 'slope' or 'differential' gain. So the output is less than expected using the ''[[small signal model|small signal]]'' gain of the amplifier. 

In [[Clipping_(audio)|clipping]], the signal is abruptly limited to a certain amplitude and is thereby distorted in keeping under that level. This creates extra harmonics that are not present in the original signal. 

"Soft" clipping or limiting  means there isn't a sharp "knee point" in the transfer characteristic. A [[sine wave]] that has been softly clipped will become more like a [[square wave]], with more rounded edges, but will still [[harmonic distortion|have many extra harmonics]].

=== Compression ===
Compression of gain is caused by non-linear characteristics of the device when run at large amplitudes.  With any signal, as the input level is increased beyond the linear range of the amplifier, gain compression will occur. 

A transistor's operating point may move with temperature, so higher power output may lead to compression due to collector dissipation. But it's not a change in gain; it's non-linear distortion. The output level stays relatively the same as the input level goes higher. Once the [[nonlinearity|non-linear]] portion of the transfer characteristic of any amplifier is reached, any increase in input will not be matched by a proportional increase in output. Thus there is compression of gain.  Also, at this time because the transfer function is no longer linear, [[harmonic distortion]] will result.

==== Intentional compression ====
In intentional compression (sometimes called [[automatic gain control]] or [[audio level compression]]) as used in devices called 'dynamic range compressors', the overall gain of the circuit is actively changed in response to the level of the input over time, so the transfer function remains linear over a short period of time. A sine wave into such a system will still look like a sine wave at the output, but the overall gain is varied, depending on the level of that sine wave. Above a certain input level, the output sine wave will always be the same amplitude. The output level of Intentional compression varies over time, in order to minimize non linear behavior. With gain compression, the opposite is true, its output is constant. In this respect intentional compression serves less of an artistic purpose.

== Radio-frequency compression ==

"Gain compression" in RF amplifiers is similar to soft clipping. However, in [[narrowband]] systems, the effect "looks" more like gain compression simply because the harmonics are filtered out after amplification. Many [[data sheet]]s for RF amplifiers list gain compression rather than distortion figures because it's easier to measure and is more important than distortion figures in nonlinear RF amplifiers.

In [[wideband]] and low-[[frequency]] systems, the nonlinear effects are readily visible, e.g. the output is [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipped]]. To see the same thing at 1&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]], an [[oscilloscope]] with a [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of at least 10&amp;nbsp;GHz is needed. Observing with a [[spectrum analyzer]], the fundamental compressed and the [[harmonic]]s picking up. 

=== Examples of RF compression ===

A low-noise [[linear amplifier|RF amplifier]], if fed by a [[directional antenna]] to a consumer 900&amp;nbsp;[[Megahertz|MHz]] receiver, should improve the transmission range. It works, but the receiver may also pick up a couple of [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] stations around 700&amp;nbsp;MHz.
 
For example, if channel 54 is transmitting 6&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] of [[Amplitude modulation|AM]], [[Frequency modulation|FM]], and [[Phase modulation|PM]], the RF front end, expecting −80&amp;nbsp;[[dBm]], would be grossly overloaded and generate mixing products. This is a typical effect of gain compression.

== High-power loudspeakers ==

A form of gain compression also takes place in [[loudspeaker]] [[voice coil]]s when they heat up and increase their [[electrical resistance|resistance]]. This causes less [[power (physics)|power]] to be drawn from the amplifier and a reduction in [[sound pressure level]].

'''Gandhigiri''' is a [[neologism]] in India which is used to express the tenets of [[Gandhism]] (the ideas of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] which include [[Satyagraha]], [[Mahatma Gandhi#Gandhi's principles|non-violence, and truth]]) in contemporary terms. The term became popular due to its usage in the 2006 [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film, ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Arunabha (December 23–29, 2006). "[http://www.epw.org.in/uploads/articles/10078.pdf Lage Raho Munna Bhai: Unravelling Brand Gandhigiri: Gandhi, the man, was once the message.

==Usage==
As a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] expression in various languages in India including Marathi, Hindi and Tamil, "Gandhigiri" refers to the practice of the ideals of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name="Ramachandaran"/&gt; It is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] form of [[Gandhism]]. ''Gandhism'' (or ''Gandhianism'') is a term which attempts to summarize the philosophies of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Basic tenets of Gandhism include ''[[satya]]'' (truth) and ''[[Satyagraha]]'': "Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force...that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or non-violence."&lt;ref name="essenfischer"&gt;{{cite book

{{cquote|Its root meaning is holding on to truth, hence truth-force. I have also called it Love-force or Soul-force. In the application of Satyagraha I discovered in the earliest stages that pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one's opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and sympathy. For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth not by infliction of suffering on the opponent but on one's self." &lt;ref name="gandhisatya61"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as it was in ''[[Lage Raho Munna Bhai]],'' where [[Munna Bhai]] had to learn to give up "Dadagiri" in exchange for "Gandhigiri").&lt;ref name="hindushah0926"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/features/showfeatures.asp?slug=Gandhigiri+inspires+young+generation&amp;id=1454 Gandhigiri inspires young generation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularization of term==
{{main|Lage Raho Munna Bhai}}

===Overview===
''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[Cinema of India|Indian]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[Comedy film|comedy]] directed by [[Rajkumar Hirani]] and produced by [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]].  [[Sanjay Dutt]] stars in this film as ''[[Munna Bhai]],'' a local don of [[Mumbai]] (Bombay), who begins to see the spirit of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Through his interactions with the image of Gandhi, Munna Bhai begins to practice what he calls ''Gandhigiri'' to help ordinary people solve their problems.

Some have argued that the thematic attention to Gandhi's theories in ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai'' has both revived an interest in ''[[Gandhism]]'' under the new term, ''Gandhigiri'' in [[India]]&lt;ref name="mridulatoi060929"&gt;{{cite news | first=Mridula| last=Chunduri| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-29/hyderabad/27786386_1_gandhigiri-gandhi-jayanti-gandhiji| title= Gandhigiri, a cool way to live| work=timesofindia.com|publisher=Times Internet Limited| date=2006-09-29| accessdate=2006-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and has likewise "made Gandhi suddenly hip.

In the India of the post-[[P. V.

Theories for this sudden revival vary. Some have suggested that this phenomenon could be attributed to the film simplifying Gandhi's "lofty ideals" and conveying them "in contemporary, colloquial language.&lt;ref name="reuters1002"/&gt; Others, according to ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', have  noted that the appeal of the film lies in the fact that "Gandhi gets his hands dirty. He appears as an apparition only visible to the wayward gangster, counselling him on how to help others deal with everyday problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark| last=Sappenfield| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/1003/p01s04-wosc.html| title=It took a comedy to revive Gandhi's ideals in India| work=csmonitor.com|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor| date=2006-10-03| accessdate=2006-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever the reason, a 13 October 2006 article in ''The [[Boston Globe]]'', suggests that the revival has had a positive impact in India and states, "What America needs is a film that encourages people to take up Gandhigiri, [[Martin Luther King|Kinggiri]], or [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedygiri]]. If it worked for [[Bollywood]], it could work for [[Hollywood]]."&lt;ref name="Sharmaboston"&gt;{{cite news | first=Swati Gauri| last=Sharma| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/10/13/how_gandhi_got_his_mojo_back/| title=How Gandhi got his mojo back| work=boston.com|publisher=The New York Times Company |date=2006-10-13|accessdate=2006-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gandhigiri-style protests===
[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|200px|Gandhi leading [[Salt Satyagraha]], a notable example of [[Satyagraha]]]] 
Since the release of the film, there have been instances where peaceful protests were either dubbed 'Gandhigiri' or the protesters have claimed that they have been inspired by the movie.  In the [[United States]] during July 2007, piles of flowers were sent to the [[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services]] office by individuals who were legally in the U.S. but caught in a [[United States Permanent Resident Card|green card]] backlog. This was an act of Gandhigiri (or [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] protest) copied from ''Lage Raho Munna Bhai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/gandhigiri-works-magic-for-indians-seeking-green-card/45233-2-7.html| title=Gandhigiri works magic for Indians seeking green card| work=[[CNN IBN]]|publisher=[[CNN IBN]] |date=2007-07-19|accessdate=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been positive reactions to this event.  The USCIS shipped the flowers to the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and Bethesda Naval hospitals. A 15 July 2007 editorial in ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' argued, "let's hope their protest gets results - because Americans are fortunate to have living among them people who are this ingenious, and this thoughtful of others, and this capable of channeling anger into beauty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=| last=| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bal-ed.flowers15jul15,0,5046454.story?coll=bal-opinion-headlines| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130117140605/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bal-ed.flowers15jul15,0,5046454.story?coll=bal-opinion-headlines| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2013-01-17| title=Flower power| work=Baltimore Sun| publisher=[[Baltimore Sun]]| date=2007-07-15| accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, the USCIS announced that "it will accept applications from foreign professionals seeking permanent residency through an expedited process, reversing its earlier decision." USCIS Director, [[Emilio T. Gonzalez]] noted of the Gandhigiri protest, "The public reaction to the July 2 announcement made it clear that the federal government's management of this process needs further review [...] I am committed to working with Congress and the State Department to implement a more efficient system in line with public expectations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ibnlive.com/news/gandhigiri-works-green-card-seekers-make-us-change-heart/45183-2.html| title='Gandhigiri works!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7828">In [[biology]], memory is present if the state of a biological system depends on its history in addition to present conditions. If this memory is recorded in the genetic material and stably inherited through cell division ([[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]]), it is genetic memory.

==Somatic memory==

''Somatic memory'' is limited to the organism and not passed on to subsequent generations. However, its mechanism may involve mitotically stable genetic memory. The term applies for cellular memory, animals' memory, and plants' memory, as described in the following paragraphs.

===Cellular memory===

All cells in multicellular organisms are derived from a [[pluripotent]] [[zygote]] and contain the same genetic material (with a few exceptions). However, they are capable of recording a history of their development within the organism leading to their specialized functions and limitations. Cells often employ [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] processes that affect DNA-protein interactions to record this ''cellular memory'' in the form of [[mitosis|mitotically]] stable changes of the genetic material without a change in the [[DNA]] sequence itself. This is typically achieved via changes of the [[chromatin]] structure.&lt;ref name="pmid17416595"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hirose S |title=Crucial roles for chromatin dynamics in cellular memory |journal=J. Biochem. |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=615–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17416595 |doi=10.1093/jb/mvm092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[methylation]] patterns of the DNA molecule itself and proteins involved in packaging DNA, such as [[histone]]s (also referred to as "histone code").&lt;ref name="pmid11782440"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory |journal=[[Genes &amp; Development]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12419240"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turner BM |title=Cellular memory and the histone code |journal=Cell |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=285–91 |year=2002 |pmid=12419240 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===

A case of somatic genetic memory is the ''immunological memory'' of the [[adaptive immune response]] in [[vertebrate]]s. The immune system is capable of learning to recognize pathogens and keeping a memory of this learning process, which is the basis of the success of [[vaccination]]s. [[Antibody]] genes in B and T [[lymphocyte]]s are assembled from separate gene segments, giving each lymphocyte a unique antibody coding sequence leading to the vast diversity of antibodies in the immune system. If stimulated by an [[antigen]] (e.g. following vaccination or an [[infection]] with a [[pathogen]]), these antibodies are further fine-tuned via [[hypermutation]]. [[Memory B cell]]s capable of producing these antibodies form the basis for acquired immunological memory.&lt;ref name="pmid15130504"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crotty S, Ahmed R |title=Immunological memory in humans |journal=Semin. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=197–203 |year=2004 |pmid=15130504 |doi=10.1016/j.smim.2004.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual therefore carries a unique genetic memory of its immune system's close encounters with pathogens. As a somatic memory, this is not passed on to the next generation.

===In plants===

Plants that undergo [[vernalization]] (promotion of flowering by a prolonged exposure to cold temperatures) record a ''genetic memory of winter'' to gain the competence to flower. The process involves epigenetically recording the length of cold exposure through [[chromatin remodeling]] which leads to mitotically stable changes in gene expression (the "winter code").&lt;ref name="pmid16980591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sung S, Amasino RM |title=Molecular genetic studies of the memory of winter |journal=J. Exp. Bot. |volume=57 |issue=13 |pages=3369–77 |year=2006 |pmid=16980591 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erl105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This releases the inhibition of flowering initiation and allows the plants to bloom with the correct timing at the onset of spring. As a somatic memory, this state is not passed on to subsequent generations but has to be acquired by each individual plant. The process of vernalization was falsely assumed to be a stably inherited genetic memory passed on to subsequent generations by the [[Russia]]n geneticist [[Trofim Lysenko]]. Lysenko's claims of genetic memory and efforts to obtain or fabricate results in proof of it had disastrous effects for Russian genetics in the early 20th century (also see: [[Lysenkoism]]).&lt;ref name="pmid15466409"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amasino R |title=Vernalization, competence, and the epigenetic memory of winter |journal=Plant Cell |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=2553–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15466409 |doi=10.1105/tpc.104.161070 |pmc=520954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inherited epigenetic memory===
In [[genetics]], [[genomic imprinting]] or other patterns of inheritance that are not determined by DNA sequence alone can form an epigenetic memory that is passed on to subsequent generations through [[meiosis]]. In contrast, somatic genetic memories are passed on by [[mitosis]] and limited to the individual, but are not passed on to the offspring. Both processes include similar epigenetic mechanisms, e.g. involving histones and methylation patterns.&lt;ref name="pmid17467256"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ooi SL, Henikoff S |title=Germline histone dynamics and epigenetics |journal=Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=257–65 |year=2007 |pmid=17467256 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2007.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17341434"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gehring M, Henikoff S |title=DNA methylation dynamics in plant genomes |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1769 |issue=5-6 |pages=276–86 |year=2007 |pmid=17341434 |doi=10.1016/j.bbaexp.2007.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microbial memory===
In microbes, genetic memory is present in the form of inversion of specific DNA sequences serving as a switch between alternative patterns of gene expression.&lt;ref name="pmid12111734"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casadesús J, D'Ari R |title=Memory in bacteria and phage |journal=BioEssays |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=512–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12111734 |doi=10.1002/bies.10102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
In [[population genetics]] and [[evolution]], genetic memory represents the recorded history of adaptive changes in a species. Selection of organisms carrying genes coding for the best adapted proteins results in the [[evolution]] of species. An example for such a genetic memory is the [[innate immune response]] that represents a recording of the history of common microbial and viral pathogens encountered throughout the evolutionary history of the species.&lt;ref name="pmid14685686"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dempsey PW, Vaidya SA, Cheng G |title=The art of war: Innate and adaptive immune responses |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=2604–21 |year=2003 |pmid=14685686 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3180-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the somatic memory of the adaptive immune response, the innate immune response is present at birth and does not require the immune system to learn to recognize antigens.

In the history of theories of evolution, the proposed genetic memory of an individual's experiences and environmental influences was a central part of [[Lamarckism]] to explain the inheritance of evolutionary changes.

===Animal behavior===
In [[ethology]], genetic memory refers the inheritance of [[instinct]] in animals.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The [[English-language Wikipedia]] was estimated in 2014 to hold around 25,000 articles on health-related topics.&lt;ref name="around half"&gt;{{cite web |title=Around half of Wikipedia's medical editors are experts |url=https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/12/05/around-half-of-wikipedias-medical-editors-are-experts/ |work=Wikimedia Blog |first=Nusa |last=Faric |date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across Wikipedia encyclopedias in all languages there were 155,000 health articles using 950,000 citations to sources and which collectively received 4.8 billion pageviews in 2013.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilman|first1=James M|last2=West|first2=Andrew G|title=Wikipedia and Medicine: Quantifying Readership, Editors, and the Significance of Natural Language|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=17|issue=3|year=2015|pages=e62|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.4069|pmid=25739399|pmc=4376174}}&lt;/ref&gt; This amount of traffic makes Wikipedia one of the most consulted health resources in the world, or perhaps the most consulted resource.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Amount of health content==
As of the end of 2013, the English Wikipedia had 29,072 medical articles, while across all language versions of Wikipedia, there were 155,805 medical articles.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt; As of March 2017, the English Wikipedia had 30,000 medical articles, while there were 164,000 medical articles in other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shafee |first1=Thomas |last2=Masukume |first2=Gwinyai |last3=Kipersztok |first3=Lisa |last4=Das |first4=Diptanshu |last5=Häggström |first5=Mikael |last6=Heilman |first6=James |date=November 2017 |title=Evolution of Wikipedia's medical content: past, present and future |url=http://jech.bmj.com/content/71/11/1122 |journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=1122–1129 |doi=10.1136/jech-2016-208601|pmid=28847845 |pmc=5847101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there were about 6,000 anatomy articles on the English Wikipedia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ledger |first1=Thomas Stephen |date=September 2017 |title=Introduction to anatomy on Wikipedia |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=231 |issue=3 |pages=430–432 |doi=10.1111/joa.12640|pmid=28703298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these are not classified as "medical articles" in Wikipedia's categorization scheme and thus are not included in the 30,000 figure above.&lt;ref name="HeilmanWest2015"/&gt;

==Academic studies==

===Accuracy and usefulness===
A 2007 study examined a sample of Wikipedia pages about the most frequently performed surgical procedures in the United States, and found that 85.7% of them were appropriate for patients and that these articles had "a remarkably high level of internal validity".&lt;ref name=jacs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devgan|first1=Lara|last2=Powe|first2=Neil|last3=Blakey|first3=Brittony|last4=Makary|first4=Martin|title=Wiki-Surgery?

A 2008 study reported that drug information on Wikipedia "has a more narrow scope, is less complete, and has more errors of omission" than did such information on the traditionally edited online database [[Medscape Drug Reference]].&lt;ref name="clauson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clauson|first1=K.

A 2011 assessment of 50 medical articles on Wikipedia found that 56% of the references cited on these pages could be considered reputable, and that each entry contained 29 reputable sources on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haigh|first1=CA|title=Wikipedia as an evidence source for nursing and healthcare students.|journal=Nurse Education Today|date=February 2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=135–9|doi=10.1016/j.nedt.2010.05.004|pmid=20646799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study examined Wikipedia pages about five [[statin]]s, and concluded that these pages did not contain incorrect or misleading information, but that they were often missing information about drug interactions and contraindications to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kupferberg|first1=N|last2=Protus|first2=BM|title=Accuracy and completeness of drug information in Wikipedia: an assessment.|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA|date=October 2011|volume=99|issue=4|pages=310–3|pmid=22022226|doi=10.3163/1536-5050.99.4.010|pmc=3193353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another 2011 study examining Wikipedia articles on the 20 most widely prescribed drugs found that seven of these articles did not have any references, and concluded that "Wikipedia does not provide consistently accurate, complete, and referenced medication information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lavsa|first1=Stacey M.|last2=Corman|first2=Shelby L.|last3=Culley|first3=Colleen M.|last4=Pummer|first4=Tara L.|title=Reliability of Wikipedia as a medication information source for pharmacy students|journal=Currents in Pharmacy Teaching and Learning|date=April 2011|volume=3|issue=2|pages=154–158|doi=10.1016/j.cptl.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment of Wikipedia articles in 2012 on [[dietary supplements]] found that Wikipedia articles were "frequently incomplete, of variable quality, and sometimes inconsistent with reputable sources of information on these products."&lt;ref name="PhillipsLam2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillips|first1=Jennifer|last2=Lam|first2=Connie|last3=Palmisano|first3=Lisa|title=Analysis of the accuracy and readability of herbal supplement information on Wikipedia|journal=Journal of the American Pharmacists Association|volume=54|issue=4|year=2014|pages=406–14|issn=1544-3191|doi=10.1331/JAPhA.2014.13181|pmid=25063262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 scoping review published in the ''[[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' summarized the existing evidence about the use of wikis, Wikipedia and other collaborative writing applications in health care and found that the available research publications were observational reports rather than the primary research studies which would be necessary to begin drawing conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Wikis and Collaborative Writing Applications in Health Care: A Scoping Review|url = http://www.jmir.org/2013/10/e210/|journal = [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]|date = 8 October 2013|pmc = 3929050|pmid = 24103318|volume = 15|issue = 10|doi = 10.2196/jmir.2787|first = Patrick M|last = Archambault|first2 = Tom H van de|last2 = Belt|first3 = Francisco J Grajales|last3 = III|first4 = Marjan J|last4 = Faber|first5 = Craig E|last5 = Kuziemsky|first6 = Susie|last6 = Gagnon|first7 = Andrea|last7 = Bilodeau|first8 = Simon|last8 = Rioux|first9 = Willianne LDM|last9 = Nelen|page = e210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study that examined 97 Wikipedia articles about [[complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM) found that 4% of them had attained "Good article" status, and that CAM articles on Wikipedia tended to be significantly shorter than those about conventional therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koo|first1=Malcolm|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine on Wikipedia: Opportunities for Improvement|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|date=2014|volume=2014|pages=1–4|doi=10.1155/2014/105186|pmid=24864148|pmc=4016830}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In May 2014, ''[[The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association]]'' published an article which concluded that "Most Wikipedia articles for the 10 costliest conditions in the United States contain errors compared with standard peer-reviewed sources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Hasty|first1 = Robert|last2 = Garvalosa|first2 = Ryan|last3 = Barbato|first3 = Vincenzo|last4 = Valdes|first4 = Pedro|last5 = Powers|first5 = David|last6 = Hernandez|first6 = Emmanuel|last7 = John|first7 = Jones|last8 = Suciu|first8 = Gabriel|last9 = Qureshi|first9 = Farheen|last10 = Popa-Radu|first10 = Matei|last11 = San Jose|first11 = Sergio|last12 = Drexler|first12 = Nathaniel|last13 = Patankar|first13 = Rohan|last14 = Paz|first14 = Jose|last15 = King|first15 = Christopher|last16 = Gerber|first16 = Hilary|last17 = Valladares|first17 = Michael|last18 = Somji|first18 = Alyaz|title = Wikipedia vs Peer-Reviewed Medical Literature for Information About the 10 Most Costly Medical Conditions|journal = The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|volume = 114|issue = 5|year = 2014|pages = 368–373|issn = 0098-6151|doi = 10.7556/jaoa.2014.035|pmid = 24778001}}

A 2014 study found that when the FDA issues new safety warnings about drugs, in 41% of cases reviewed Wikipedia articles about those drugs were updated to give the new safety information within two weeks.&lt;ref name="HwangBourgeois2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hwang|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Bourgeois|first2=Florence T.|last3=Seeger|first3=John D.|title=Drug Safety in the Digital Age|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=26|year=2014|pages=2460–2462|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1401767|pmid=24963564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 23% of Wikipedia drug articles were updated to give this information within an average of about 40 days, but 36% of articles are not updated with this information within a year.&lt;ref name="HwangBourgeois2014"/&gt;

A 2014 comparison between selected drug information from pharmacology textbooks and comparable information on the [[English Wikipedia|English-language]] and [[German Wikipedia|German-language]] Wikipedias found that the drug information in Wikipedia covers most of what is essential for undergraduate pharmacology studies and that it is accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Accuracy and Completeness of Drug Information in Wikipedia: A Comparison with Standard Textbooks of Pharmacology|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 24 September 2014|pmc = 4174509|pmid = 25250889|pages = e106930|volume = 9|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0106930|first = Jona|last = Kräenbring|first2 = Tika|last2 = Monzon Penza|first3 = Joanna|last3 = Gutmann|first4 = Susanne|last4 = Muehlich|first5 = Oliver|last5 = Zolk|first6 = Leszek|last6 = Wojnowski|first7 = Renke|last7 = Maas|first8 = Stefan|last8 = Engelhardt|first9 = Antonio|last9 = Sarikas|bibcode = 2014PLoSO...9j6930K}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study comparing the coverage of the [[MMR vaccine controversy|autism-vaccine controversy]] on several websites found that Wikipedia's articles were broadly pro-vaccine. The study attributed this pro-vaccine stance to "this highly controversial topic attracting committed editors who strictly enforce the requirements for academic references."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venkatraman |first1=Anand |last2=Garg |first2=Neetika |date=2015 |title=Greater freedom of speech on Web 2.0 correlates with dominance of views linking vaccines to autism |journal=Vaccines |volume=17 |issue=33 |pages=1422–1425 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.01.078|pmid=25665960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Readability===

A 2013 review of [[nephrology]] content on Wikipedia found it to be "a comprehensive and fairly reliable medical resource for nephrology patients that is written at a college reading level".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = G.

A 2014 study found that Wikipedia's article on [[Parkinson's disease]] had a [[Flesch–Kincaid readability tests#Flesch reading ease|Flesch reading ease]] score of 30.31, meaning that it was difficult to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brigo|first1=F|last2=Erro|first2=R|title=The readability of the English Wikipedia article on Parkinson's disease|journal=Neurological Sciences|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1045–6|date=18 January 2015|pmid=25596713|doi=10.1007/s10072-015-2077-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study evaluating 134 Wikipedia articles on [[autoimmune disease]]s found that they were very difficult to read and required at least a university graduate reading level.

===Alternative medicine===

People who promote [[alternative medicine]] have complained that Wikipedia negatively portrays [[holistic health]] treatments including [[energy medicine]], [[Emotional Freedom Techniques]], [[Thought Field Therapy]] and [[Tapas Acupressure Technique]].&lt;ref name="Time March 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/36938/wikipedia-founder-sticks-it-to-lunatic-holistic-healers/ |title=Wikipedia Founder Sticks It To 'Lunatic' Holistic Healers |first=Alexandra |last=Sifferlin |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 March 2014 |accessdate=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Wales has stated, "If you can get your work published in respectable scientific journals – that is to say, if you can produce evidence through replicable scientific experiments, then Wikipedia will cover it appropriately."&lt;ref name="Time March 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hay Newman, Lily (27 March 2014) [http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2014/03/27/jimmy_wales_denies_petition_from_advocates_of_holistic_healing_about_wikipedia.html Jimmy Wales Gets Real, and Sassy, About Wikipedia's Holistic Healing Coverage], [[Slate (magazine)]] Retrieved 23 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energypsych.org/?wikipediastatement ACEP's Position Statement on Wikipedia] energypsych.org Retrieved 23 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Similar concerns have been raised regarding its coverage of [[homeopathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-ullman/dysfunction-at-wikipedia-_b_5924226.html|title = Dysfunction at Wikipedia on Homeopathic Medicine|last = Ullman|first = Dana|date = 10 October 2014|work = [[The Huffington Post]]|access-date = 23 November 2014|via = |author-link = Dana Ullman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia policy for articles that "could reasonably be perceived as relating to human health" comes under the policy for [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources (medicine-related articles)|medicine-related articles]] which is [[science]]-based.

===General public===

A 2015 study compared the popularity of Wikipedia's articles on ten of the most common neurological disorders over a 90-day period from April 2014 to July 2014; it found that there was no relationship between the incidence or prevalence of a neurological disorder and the number of page views it received. For example, Wikipedia's article on [[multiple sclerosis]] was far more popular than its articles on more common disorders like [[migraine]], [[epilepsy]], or [[stroke]]. The authors theorized that this might be due to the increasing prevalence of [[MRI scans]], which has led to an increase in incidental findings of [[white matter lesion]]s. Although most of these lesions have nothing to do with multiple sclerosis, they may lead patients, relatives, and even physicians to perform Internet searches on "multiple sclerosis", which may lead them to the Wikipedia article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brigo |first1=Francesco  |last2=Igwe |first2=Stanley C. |last3=Nardone |first3=Raffaele |last4=Lochner |first4=Piergiorgio |last5=Tezzon |first5=Freudiano |last6=Otte |first6=Willem M. |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia and neurological disorders |url=https://www.jocn-journal.com/article/S0967-5868(15)00099-5/fulltext |journal=Journal of Clinical Neuroscience |volume=22 |issue=7 |pages=1170–1172 |doi=10.1016/j.jocn.2015.02.006|pmid=25890773  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical students===
Wikipedia's health information has been described as "transforming how our next doctors learn medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2013/11/18/wikipedia-role-medical-education-brings-awesome-promise-and-few-risks/iasrC5cWfCPhWkF9R0mZ4L/story.html |title=Wikipedia's role in medical education brings awesome promise — and a few risks |first=Nathaniel P. |last=Morris |work=bostonglobe.com |date=18 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various commentators in health education have said that Wikipedia is popular among medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Teunis|first1=Teun|title=The Wikipedia Guide to Medicine Could the Online Encyclopaedia Provide the Basis for a New Medical School Curriculum?|journal=Student BMJ|date=March 2013|volume=21|pages=16–17|doi=10.1136/sbmj.f1091|url=http://student.bmj.com/student/view-article.html?id=sbmj.f1091|doi-broken-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study done at a single medical school showed that 97% of students used Wikipedia to study medicine, with the most common reasons being ease of access and ease of understanding. There was no relationship between a student's year in medical school and his or her use of Wikipedia, but students further along in medical school were less likely to use Wikipedia as their first resource, only resource, or most common resource; they were also more likely to perceive Wikipedia as unreliable.&lt;ref name="AllahwalaNadkarni2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allahwala|first1=Usaid K.|last2=Nadkarni|first2=Aniket|last3=Sebaratnam|first3=Deshan F.|title=Wikipedia use amongst medical students – New insights into the digital revolution|journal=Medical Teacher|volume=35|issue=4|year=2013|pages=337|issn=0142-159X|doi=10.3109/0142159X.2012.737064|pmid=23137251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[UCSF School of Medicine]] began to offer fourth-year medical students a month-long elective centered around improving Wikipedia's health-related articles. Between 2013 and 2015, 43 students took part in the course and chose a single health-related article to work on. A study of their contributions by UCSF faculty found that the students expanded their articles, added higher-quality sources, removed lower-quality sources, and improved readability. The study's authors argued that medical schools should encourage students to contribute to Wikipedia, both to improve the quality of its content and to enable students to become better health care educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azzam |first1=A |last2=Bresler |first2=D |last3=Leon |first3=A |last4=Maggio |first4=L |last5=Whitaker |first5=E |last6=Heilman |first6=J |last7=Orlowitz |first7=J |last8=Swisher |first8=V |last9=Rasberry |first9=L |last10=Otoide |first10=K |last11=Trotter |first11=F |last12=Ross |first12=W |last13=McCue |first13=JD |title=Why Medical Schools Should Embrace Wikipedia: Final-Year Medical Student Contributions to Wikipedia Articles for Academic Credit at One School. |journal=Academic Medicine |date=February 2017 |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=194–200 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0000000000001381 |pmid=27627633 |pmc=5265689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 study of five European medical schools found that students who used Wikipedia for general information were more likely to use it to look up medical information. 16% of students used Wikipedia often for general information, 60% sometimes, and 24% rarely. 12% of students used Wikipedia often for medical information, 55% sometimes, and 33% rarely. Almost all of the students (97%) found inaccurate information on Wikipedia at least once, but less than 20% of them corrected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herbert |first1=Verena G. |last2=Frings |first2=Andreas |last3=Rehatschek |first3=Herwig |last4=Richard |first4=Gilbert |last5=Leithner |first5=Andreas |date=2015 |title=Wikipedia – challenges and new horizons in enhancing medical education |journal=BMC Medical Education |volume=15 |issue=32 |pages= 32|doi=10.1186/s12909-015-0309-2|pmid=25879421 |pmc=4384304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study of online resource use by first-year medical students at [[Melbourne Medical School]] found that they used the school's online learning platform most often (daily) and used Google and Wikipedia slightly less often (approximately daily). The students considered the learning platform to be most useful, followed by Google and Wikipedia, which they considered slightly less useful than the learning platform but significantly more useful than Facebook or [[Google Scholar]]. They also considered the learning platform to be the most reliable and considered Google and Wikipedia to be significantly less reliable, although they frequently used both websites as a starting point for finding information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judd |first1=Terry |last2=Elliott |first2=Kristine |date=2017 |title=Selection and Use of Online Learning Resources by First-Year Medical Students: Cross-Sectional Study |url=http://mededu.jmir.org/2017/2/e17/ |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research I |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=e17 |doi=10.2196/mededu.7382|pmid=28970187 |pmc=5643842 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study of resources used by medical students during their general surgery [[Clinical clerkship|clerkship]] at the [[University of Florida College of Medicine]] found that review books were the most commonly used type of study resource, followed by the Internet. Wikipedia was the third-most commonly used resource and the most commonly used Internet resource. The study found no correlation between the type of resource used and students' performance on the NBME surgery subject exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Janice A. |last2=Shaw |first2=Christiana M. |last3=Tan |first3=Sanda A. |last4=Falcone |first4=John L. |date=2017 |title=Are the kids alright?

===Residents===
A 2009 study of Internet use by 35 [[junior doctors]] in the United Kingdom found that 80% of them used Google and 70% of them used Wikipedia to look up medical information at least once a week, while only 30% used [[PubMed]]. Google and Wikipedia were primarily used for background reading, while PubMed and other "best evidence" websites were used to answer specific questions for clinical decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Benjamin |last2=Joshi |first2=Indra |last3=Lemonde |first3=Hugh |last4=Wareham |first4=Jonathan |date=October 2009 |title=Junior physician's use of Web 2.0 for information seeking and medical education: A qualitative study |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505609000756?via%3Dihub |journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics |volume=78 |issue=10 |pages=645–655 |doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2009.04.008|pmid=19501017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of psychiatry residents at [[Harvard Medical School]] found that they used online resources twice as often as they used printed resources. The three most commonly used resources were UpToDate, [[PubMed]], and Wikipedia. UpToDate was the most used resource and was considered to be the most trustworthy, while PubMed was the second most used resource and was highly rated as a source of personal learning. Wikipedia was the third most used resource and received the highest ranking for ease of use; however, it was considered the least trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torous |first1=John |last2=Franzen |first2=Jamie |last3=O’Connor |first3=Ryan |last4=Mathew |first4=Ian |last5=Keshavan |first5=Matcher |last6=Kitts |first6=Robert |last7=Boland |first7=Robert |date=2015 |title=Psychiatry Residents' Use of Educational Websites: A Pilot Survey Study |journal=Academic Psychiatry |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=630–633 |doi=10.1007/s40596-015-0335-8|pmid=26077007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physicians and other health professionals===
A 2014 study of 259 health professionals in Spain found that while 53% of them used the [[Spanish Wikipedia]] to look up medical information during work, only 3% of them considered it reliable and only 16% recommended it to their patients. Only 16% had ever edited a Wikipedia article; the most common reasons for not doing were that they did not consider themselves an expert (51%), they preferred to blog or publish peer-reviewed articles (21%), and they were concerned that someone would undo any contributions they made (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Santillán |first1=Azucena |last2=Máñez |first2=Miguel Ángel |last3=Meijome |first3=Xose Manuel |date=2014 |title=Uso de Wikipedia por los profesionales de la salud |trans-title=Use of Wikipedia by health professionals |url=http://www.gacetasanitaria.org/es/uso-wikipedia-por-los-profesionales/articulo/S0213911114001964/ |language=Spanish |journal=Gaceta Sanitaria |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=522 |doi=10.1016/j.gaceta.2014.04.014|pmid=25087118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of contributors==
A 2014 interview study found that around half of the editors of health-related content on the English-language Wikipedia are health care professionals, while the other half includes some medical students.&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; An author of this study wrote that this provides "reassurance about the reliability of the website".&lt;ref name="around half" /&gt; The study also found that the "core editor community", who actively monitor and edit most health-related articles on the English-language Wikipedia, numbered around 300 people.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farič|first1=Nuša|last2=Potts|first2=Henry WW|title=Motivations for Contributing to Health-Related Articles on Wikipedia: An Interview Study|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=16|issue=12|year=2014|pages=e260|issn=1438-8871|doi=10.2196/jmir.3569|pmid=25498308|pmc=4275502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who contribute on these topics do so for a variety of reasons, including a desire to better learn the subjects themselves, and a sense of both responsibility and enjoyment in improving others' access to health information.&lt;ref name="FaričPotts2014"/&gt;

A 2016 study found that Wikipedia editors who contributed to articles on [[designer drug]]s were most likely to also contribute to articles on illegal drugs and pharmaceutical drugs, implying that they have a background in pharmacology. They were also more likely to contribute to articles on neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders, other diseases, and cell biology; they were least likely to edit articles about popular culture topics or history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dijkstra |first1=Louis J. |last2=Krieg |first2=Lisa J. |date=2016 |title=From MDMA to Lady Gaga: Expertise and contribution behavior of editing communities on Wikipedia |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916326801 |journal=Procedia Computer Science |volume=1 |pages=96–106 |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2016.11.013|bibcode=2010ProCS...1.1119G |arxiv=1005.5384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''helminth protein''', or [[Helminths|helminthic]] [[antigen]], is a protein derived from a [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[worm]] that causes an [[immune]] reaction. When secreted, these [[proteins]] may modify the host's immune response in order to promote longevity of the parasite. Helminth proteins can result in a deregulated response to [[infection]], and are implicated in reduced reactivity to other [[antigen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Freedman | first1 = David O. | name-list-format = vanc | title =Immunopathogenetic Aspects of Disease Induced by Helminth Parasites | date = 1997 | publisher = Karger | location = Basel | isbn = 978-3-8055-6400-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other helminth proteins promote parasite survival in other ways, particularly since parasites must depend on hosts for the supply of essential nutrients.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McDermott L, Kennedy MW, McManus DP, Bradley JE, Cooper A, Storch J | title = How helminth lipid-binding proteins offload their ligands to membranes: differential mechanisms of fatty acid transfer by the ABA-1 polyprotein allergen and Ov-FAR-1 proteins of nematodes and Sj-FABPc of schistosomes | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 41 | issue = 21 | pages = 6706–13 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12022874 | doi = 10.1021/bi0159635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their pathogenic properties, helminth proteins have potential to be co-opted to treat a number of other human diseases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harnett W | title = Secretory products of helminth parasites as immunomodulators | journal = Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology | volume = 195 | issue = 2 | pages = 130–6 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24704440 | doi = 10.1016/j.molbiopara.2014.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immunoregulation ==

Helminth proteins modulate the immune response of their hosts, but do not suppress it entirely. A number of proteins are able to induce production of [[IL-10 family|IL-10]], an anti-inflammatory cytokine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klotz C, Ziegler T, Figueiredo AS, Rausch S, Hepworth MR, Obsivac N, Sers C, Lang R, Hammerstein P, Lucius R, Hartmann S | title = A helminth immunomodulator exploits host signaling events to regulate cytokine production in macrophages | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = e1001248 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21253577 | pmc = 3017123 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IL-10 is partially responsible for reducing expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as [[CD86]] on [[macrophage]]s. CD86 is one of the proteins which interact with [[CD28]] to activate [[T helper cell]]s; without it, T helper cell response is mitigated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Schistosoma|Schistosome]] proteins also contain abundant [[protease]]s which and cleave [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] antibodies. Alpha-1, a protein released by schistosome eggs, can also be a [[chemokine]] binding protein, preventing the recruitment of other immune cells like [[neutrophil]]s. ''T. canis'' C-type [[lectin]]s are additionally able to bind to mammalian [[carbohydrate]]s, suggesting that they may promote evasion of the host’s immune system by preventing the migration of host immune cells.

A number of helminth species also secrete high levels of [[antioxidant]]s to avoid [[phagocytosis]]; those antioxidants are needed because phagocytes like macrophages frequently produce [[reactive oxygen species]] like oxygen [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]], [[superoxide]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]] to attack parasites. Additionally, many [[nematode]]s residing in the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] may secrete [[acetylcholinesterase]], which is responsible for the degradation of [[acetylcholine]] to terminate neuronal signals. Acetylcholinesterase may prevent parasite clearance from the gut by preventing acetylcholine-mediated signaling from stimulating the production of intestinal [[chloride]] and [[mucus]].

== Lipid Acquisition ==

Parasites like helminths do not synthesize their own [[fatty acid]]s or [[sterol]]s, and are consequently dependent on their hosts for [[essential nutrient]]s. A number of different classes of lipid-binding proteins have been investigated and characterized. Of these, NPA (nematode polyprotein antigen/allergen) FAR, and Sj-FABPc demonstrate different [[Ligand (biochemistry)|binding affinities]] for [[fatty acid]]s and/or [[retinoid]]s. Ov-FAR-1, which is produced by the [[Onchocerciasis|riverblindness]] parasite ''Onchocerca volvulus'' binds [[retinol]] with great affinity, and this activity may result in the pathology it causes. Ov-FAR-1, however, binds fatty acids with less affinity. On the other hand, Sj-FABPc, found in ''[[Schistosoma japonicum]]'', binds fatty acids with high affinity, but does not bind to retinol. All three of these proteins are able to deliver lipids to acceptor [[Cell membrane|membranes]], but this transfer process in Ov-FAR-1 and ABA-1A1 (a type of NPA) requires an [[Aqueous solution|aqueous]] [[diffusion]] step. Sj-FABPc uses a collision mechanism, and transfer is not affected by changing salt concentrations, suggesting that it may be important to [[intracellular]] targeted transport and [[metabolism]] of fatty acids. Ov-FAR-1 and ABA-1A1 may instead behave similarly to extracellular lipid-binding proteins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Genomic Prediction ==

The Helminth Secretome Database (HSD) is a repository for helminth proteins predicted using expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Previously identified ESTs, which correspond to known helminth proteins, are used to predict the location and function of newly discovered helminth proteins based on genomic sequencing. Additionally, the database can also be used to develop protein targets for new drugs to treat helminth infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garg G, Ranganathan S | title = Helminth secretome database (HSD): a collection of helminth excretory/secretory proteins predicted from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 13 Suppl 7 | issue = 7 | pages = S8 | date = 2012-01-01 | pmid = 23281827 | pmc = 3546426 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-13-S7-S8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potential Therapeutics ==

Given the modulatory properties of helminth proteins, it has been suggested that they may be co-opted to successfully treat other human diseases, particularly those associated with [[Autoimmune disease|auto-immunity disorders]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In particular, immunization with P28GST, a schistosome [[Glutathione S-transferase|glutathione ''S''-transferase]] enzyme in rats has been shown to reduce [[colitis]] lesions and expression of [[Proinflammatory cytokine|pro-inflammatory cytokines]] by [[eosinophil]] responses to inflammation. P28GST is thus a promising potential therapeutic for treating [[inflammatory bowel disease]]s like [[Crohn's disease|Crohn’s disease]] and [[ulcerative colitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Driss V, El Nady M, Delbeke M, Rousseaux C, Dubuquoy C, Sarazin A, Gatault S, Dendooven A, Riveau G, Colombel JF, Desreumaux P, Dubuquoy L, Capron M | title = The schistosome glutathione S-transferase P28GST, a unique helminth protein, prevents intestinal inflammation in experimental colitis through a Th2-type response with mucosal eosinophils | language = en | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 322–35 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26174763 | pmc = 4801903 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2015.62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, injection of proteins secreted by ''[[Fasciola hepatica]]'' in [[NOD mice|nonobese diabetic mice]] prevented the onset of [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type I diabetes]], with 84% of the mice showing normal glucose levels 26 weeks after injection. This phenomenon is attributed to the suppression of [[Interferon gamma|interferon-gamma]] secretion from [[Reactive lymphocyte|autoreactive T cells]] following the activation of regulatory M2 macrophages. This result supports the possibility of eventually using helminth products to treat type I diabetes in humans as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lund ME, O'Brien BA, Hutchinson AT, Robinson MW, Simpson AM, Dalton JP, Donnelly S | title = Secreted proteins from the helminth Fasciola hepatica inhibit the initiation of autoreactive T cell responses and prevent diabetes in the NOD mouse | journal = PLoS One | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = e86289 | date = 2014-01-21 | pmid = 24466007 | pmc = 3897667 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0086289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18557">[[IBM]] [[System/360]] computers, and subsequent machines based on that architecture (mainframes), support a '''[[hexadecimal]] [[floating point|floating-point]]''' format ('''HFP''').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/princOps/A22-6821-6_360PrincOpsJan67.pdf ''IBM System/360 Principles of Operation''], IBM Publication A22-6821-6, Seventh Edition (January 13, 1967), pp.41-50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/370/princOps/GA22-7000-4_370_Principles_Of_Operation_Sep75.pdf ''IBM System/370 Principles of Operation''], IBM Publication GA22-7000-4, Fifth Edition (September 1, 1975), pp.157-170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publibz.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/dz9zr001.pdf ''z/Architecture Principles of Operation''], IBM Publication SA22-7832-01, Second Edition (October, 2001), chapter 9 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to [[IEEE 754]] floating-point, the IBM floating-point format has a longer [[significand]], and a shorter [[exponent]]. All IBM floating-point formats have 7 bits of exponent with a [[exponent bias|bias]] of 64. The [[normalized mantissa|normalized]] range of representable numbers is from 16&lt;sup&gt;−65&lt;/sup&gt; to 16&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; (approx. 5.39761 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−79&lt;/sup&gt; to 7.237005 × 10&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;).

The number is represented as the following formula: (−1)&lt;sup&gt;sign&lt;/sup&gt; × 0.&lt;small&gt;significand&lt;/small&gt; × 16&lt;sup&gt;exponent−64&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Single-precision 32-bit ==
A [[single precision|single-precision]] binary floating-point number (called "short" by IBM) is stored in a 32-bit word:

:{|

|...
|0
|align="left"|''(bit index)''*
|-
|colspan="8"| ''* IBM documentation numbers the bits from left to right, so that the most significant bit is designated as bit number 0.''
|}

In this format the initial bit is not suppressed, and the
radix point is set to the left of the mantissa in increments of 4 bits.

Since the base is 16, the exponent in this form is about twice as large as the equivalent in IEEE 754, in order to have similar exponent range in binary, 9 exponent bits would be required.

=== Example ===
Consider encoding the value −118.625 as an IBM single-precision floating-point value.

The value is negative, so the sign bit is 1.

The value 118.625&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; in binary is 1110110.101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This value is normalized by moving the radix point left four bits (one hexadecimal digit) at a time until the leftmost digit is zero, yielding 0.01110110101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The remaining rightmost digits are padded with zeros, yielding a 24-bit fraction of .0111&amp;nbsp;0110&amp;nbsp;1010&amp;nbsp;0000&amp;nbsp;0000&amp;nbsp;0000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The normalized value moved the radix point two digits to the left, yielding a multiplier and exponent of 16&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;. A bias of +64 is added to the exponent (+2), yielding +66, which is 100&amp;nbsp;0010&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Combining the sign, exponent plus bias, and normalized fraction produces this encoding:

:{|
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="width:20px;text-align:center;background-color:#FC9"|S
|style="width:90px;text-align:center;background-color:#99F"|Exp
|style="width:250px;text-align:center;background-color:#9F9"|Fraction
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FEC"|&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CCF"|&lt;tt&gt;100 0010&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CFC"|&lt;tt&gt;0111 0110 1010 0000 0000 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|}

In other words, the number represented is −0.76A000&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; × 16&lt;sup&gt;66 − 64&lt;/sup&gt; = −0.4633789&amp;hellip; × 16&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; = −118.625

=== Largest representable number ===
:{|
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="width:20px;text-align:center;background-color:#FC9"|S
|style="width:90px;text-align:center;background-color:#99F"|Exp
|style="width:250px;text-align:center;background-color:#9F9"|Fraction
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FEC"|&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CCF"|&lt;tt&gt;111 1111&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CFC"|&lt;tt&gt;1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|}

The number represented is +0.FFFFFF&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; × 16&lt;sup&gt;127 − 64&lt;/sup&gt; = (1 − 16&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;) × 16&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ +7.2370051 × 10&lt;sup&gt;75&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Smallest positive normalized number ===
:{|
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="width:20px;text-align:center;background-color:#FC9"|S
|style="width:90px;text-align:center;background-color:#99F"|Exp
|style="width:250px;text-align:center;background-color:#9F9"|Fraction
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FEC"|&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CCF"|&lt;tt&gt;000 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CFC"|&lt;tt&gt;0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|}

The number represented is +0.1&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; × 16&lt;sup&gt;0 − 64&lt;/sup&gt; = 16&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; × 16&lt;sup&gt;−64&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ +5.397605 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−79&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Zero ===
:{|
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="width:20px;text-align:center;background-color:#FC9"|S
|style="width:90px;text-align:center;background-color:#99F"|Exp
|style="width:250px;text-align:center;background-color:#9F9"|Fraction
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FEC"|&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CCF"|&lt;tt&gt;000 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CFC"|&lt;tt&gt;0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|}

Zero (0.0) is represented in normalized form as all zero bits, which is arithmetically the value +0.0&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; × 16&lt;sup&gt;0 − 64&lt;/sup&gt; = +0 × 16&lt;sup&gt;−64&lt;/sup&gt; ≈ +0.000000 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−79&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. Given a significand of all-bits zero, any combination of positive or negative sign bit and a non-zero biased exponent will yield a value arithmetically equal to zero. However, the normalized form generated for zero by CPU hardware is all-bits zero. This is true for all three floating-point precision formats.

=== Precision issues ===
Since the base is 16, there can be up to three leading zero bits in the binary significand. That means when the number is converted into binary, there can be as few as 21 bits of precision. Because of the "wobbling precision" effect, this can cause some calculations to be very inaccurate.

A good example of the inaccuracy is representation of decimal value 0.1. It has no exact binary or hexadecimal representation. In hexadecimal format, it is represented as 0.19999999...&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; or 0.0001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1001...&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, that is:

:{|
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="width:20px;text-align:center;background-color:#FC9"|S
|style="width:90px;text-align:center;background-color:#99F"|Exp
|style="width:250px;text-align:center;background-color:#9F9"|Fraction
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|- style="text-align:center"
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FEC"|&lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CCF"|&lt;tt&gt;100 0000&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#CFC"|&lt;tt&gt;0001 1001 1001 1001 1001 1010&lt;/tt&gt;
|style="text-align:center;background-color:#FFF"|&amp;nbsp;
|}

This has only 21 bits, whereas the binary version has 24 bits of precision.

Six hexadecimal digits of precision is roughly equivalent to six decimal digits (i.e. (6 − 1) log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(16) ≈ 6.02). A conversion of single precision hexadecimal float to decimal string would require at least 9 significant digits (i.e. 6 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(16) + 1 ≈ 8.22) in order to convert back to the same hexadecimal float value.

== Double-precision 64-bit ==
The [[Double precision|double-precision]] floating-point format (called "long" by IBM) is the same as the "short" format except that the mantissa (fraction) field is wider and the double-precision number is stored in a double word (8 bytes):

The exponent for this format covers only about a quarter of the range as the corresponding IEEE binary format.

14 hexadecimal digits of precision is roughly equivalent to 17 decimal digits. A conversion of double precision hexadecimal float to decimal string would require at least 18 significant digits in order to convert back to the same hexadecimal float value.

== Extended-precision 128-bit ==
Called extended-precision by IBM, a  [[Quadruple precision floating-point format|quadruple-precision]]  floating-point format was added to the System/370 series and was available on some S/360 models (S/360-85, -195, and others by special request or simulated by OS software). The extended-precision mantissa (fraction) field is wider, and the extended-precision number is stored as two double words (16 bytes):

28 hexadecimal digits of precision is roughly equivalent to 32 decimal digits. A conversion of extended precision hexadecimal float to decimal string would require at least 35 significant digits in order to convert back to the same hexadecimal float value.

== Arithmetic operations ==
Most arithmetic operations truncate like simple pocket calculators. Therefore, 1 − 16&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. In this case, the result is rounded away from zero.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/websphere/awdtools/hlasm/sh93fpov.pdf ESA/390 Enhanced Floating Point Support: An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== IEEE 754 on IBM mainframes ==
Starting with the [[S/390]] G5 in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Schwarz | first1 = E. M.| last2 = Krygowski | first2 = C. A.| doi = 10.1147/rd.435.0707| title = The S/390 G5 floating-point unit| journal = [[IBM Journal of Research and Development]] | volume = 43| issue = 5.6| pages = 707–721| date=September 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM mainframes have also included IEEE binary floating-point units which conform to the [[IEEE 754|IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic]]. IEEE decimal floating-point was added to [[IBM System z9]] GA2&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Duale | first1 = A. Y.| last2 = Decker | first2 = M.

Modern IBM mainframes support three floating-point radices with 3 hexadecimal (HFP) formats, 3 binary (BFP) formats, and 3 decimal (DFP) formats. There are two floating-point units per core; one supporting HFP and BFP, and one supporting DFP; there is one register file, FPRs, which holds all 3 formats.

== Special uses ==
The IBM floating-point format is used in:
* SAS 5 Transport files (.XPT) as required by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for New Drug Application (NDA) study submissions&lt;ref name=SAS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.sas.com/techsup/technote/ts140.pdf |title=The Record Layout of a Data Set in SAS Transport (XPORT) Format |accessdate=September 18, 2014}},&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GRIB]] (GRIdded Binary) data files to exchange the output of weather prediction models (IEEE [[single-precision floating-point format]] in current version),
* [[GDSII|GDS II]] (Graphic Database System II) format files ([[Open Artwork System Interchange Standard|OASIS]] is the replacement), and
* [[SEG Y]] (Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y) format files (single-precision floating-point was added to the format in 2002).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seg.org/documents/10161/77915/seg_y_rev1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

As IBM is the only remaining provider of hardware (and only in their mainframes) using their non-standard floating-point format, no popular file format requires it; Except the FDA requires the SAS file format and "All floating-point numbers in the file are stored using the IBM mainframe representation. [..] Most platforms use the IEEE representation for floating-point numbers. [..] To assist you in reading and/or writing transport files, we are providing routines to convert from IEEE representation (either big endian or little endian) to transport representation and back again."&lt;ref name=SAS/&gt; Code for IBM's format is also available under [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPLv2.1]].&lt;ref&gt;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SASxport/SASxport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems that use the IBM floating-point format ==
* [[IBM System/360]]
* [[RCA Spectra 70]]
* [[English Electric System 4]]
* [[GEC 4000 series]] minicomputers
* [[Interdata]] 16-bit and 32-bit computers

[[File:Examples of Ibid, from "Justice" by Michael J- Sandel 2013-04-08 20-17.jpg|thumbnail|An example of Ibid. citations in use, from "Justice" by [[Michael J. Sandel]].]]

'''Ibid''' is an abbreviation for the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:ibidem#Latin|ibīdem]]'', meaning "in the same place", commonly used in an [[endnote]], [[footnote]], [[bibliography]] [[citation]], or [[reference#Scholarship|scholarly reference]] to refer to the [[Source text|source]] cited in the preceding note or list item. This is similar to ''[[wikt:idem#Latin|īdem]]'', literally meaning "the same", abbreviated ''Id.'', which is commonly used in [[legal citation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/idem |title=Idem|publisher=thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibid. may also be used in the Harvard (name-date) system for in-text references where there has been a close previous citation from the same source material.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Manual of Style Online, (13.64).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Hart's Rules, Oxford University Press, 2005, p.396&lt;/ref&gt; The previous reference should be immediately visible, e.g. within the same paragraph or page. Some academic publishers now prefer that "ibid." not be italicized, as it is a commonly found term.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite web |url= http://www.cambridge.org/us/notesforauthors/cambridge_style.doc |title=Style sheet: Cambridge University Press |format=DOC |date=2013 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ibid. is an [[abbreviation]] where the last two letters of the word are omitted, it takes a full stop (period) in both British and American usage.

==Example==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:[1] E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' (New York: Academic, 1997), 23.
:[2] Ibid.
:[3] Ibid., 29.
:[4] A. Alhazred, ''The Necronomicon'' (Petrus de Dacia, 1994).
:[5] Ibid. 1, 34.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Reference 2 is the same as reference 1: E. Vijh, ''Latin for Dummies'' on page 23, whereas reference 3 refers to the same work but at a different location, namely page 29. Intervening entries require a reference to the original citation in the form Ibid. &lt;citation #&gt;, as in reference 5.

==Cultural references==

* Ibid. is used in the 1960s play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]]. Albee uses an unabbreviated ibid{{huh|date=April 2017}} in his stage directions to tell an actor to use the same tone as the previous line.
* In the 1989 book ''Pyramids'' by [[Terry Pratchett]], one of the Ephebian philosophers is called "Ibid".
* In the 1997 movie ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', the main character, Will Hunting, when arguing for himself in court against the dismissive rebuttals of the prosecuting attorney, cites obscure case law, then follows up by stating "Ibid, your Honour."

[[File:InstAlgol.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Institute of Algological Research pier]]

The '''Institute of Algological Research''' (sometimes referred to as '''Muroran Marine Station''', or '''Northern Hemisphere Field Station''') in [[Muroran]], is one of the oldest research institutes for [[Phycology]] research in Japan. Institute of Algological Research is located in the town of [[Muroran]], [[Hokkaidō]], Japan and is involved in research leading to MS and PhD degrees in [[Phycology]].  Graduate students are often registered with [[Hokkaido University]].

==History==

The '''Institute of Algological Research''' was founded in 1933.

==Habitat==
[[File:GreenA.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Rocky Intertidal shore around Institute of Algological Research has variegated flora. Featured in this photograph are Ulvophysean green algae [[Monostroma]] surrounded by brown algae [[Laminaria]] ]]
Coastal zone surrounding the institute has one of the largest seaweed biodiversity in  Japan, with over 200 species of macroalgae. The [[intertidal]] rocky shore is covered with luxuriant growth of seaweeds belonging to such diverse genera as [[Ulvophyceae]], [[Rhodophyceae]] and [[Phaeophyceae]]. The close proximity to this very diverse natural habitat makes Institute of Algological Research, one of the most prominent Phycological research institute in the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2186">The '''isohydric principle''' is the phenomenon whereby multiple acid/base pairs in solution will be in [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] with one another, tied together by their common reagent: the [[hydrogen ion]] and hence, the [[pH]] of solution. That is, when several buffers are present together in the same solution, they are all exposed to the same hydrogen ion activity. Hence, the pK of each buffer will dictate the ratio of the concentrations of its base and weak acid forms at the given pH, in accordance with the [[Henderson-Hasselbalch equation]].

Any condition that changes the balance of one of the buffer systems, also changes the balance of all the others because the buffer systems actually buffer one another by shifting hydrogen ions back and forth from one to the other.

The isohydric principle has special relevance to [[in vivo]] biochemistry where multiple acid/ base pairs are in solution. The simplifying isohydric principle gives two important concepts. First, all of the buffers in a multiple-buffered system contribute to pH of the system. Secondly, the pH (at equilibrium) can be calculated from an individual buffer system regardless of other buffers present. That is, in vivo, knowing the PCO2 (weak acid) and the bicarbonate (conjugate base) and the pKa of that buffer system, the pH can be calculated regardless of the presence of other contributing buffers. The clinical relevance is that arterial blood gas often directly measures the CO2 levels and the pH, but the bicarbonate levels are then calculated from that information—without regard to other buffers present&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nguyen|first = Minhtri K.|last2 = Kao|first2 = Liyo|last3 = Kurtz|first3 = Ira|date = 2016-11-18|title = Calculation of the equilibrium pH in a multiple-buffered aqueous solution based on partitioning of proton buffering: a new predictive formula|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

The '''Fire Mummies''' of the [[Philippines]], also known as the''' [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]] Mummies''', [[Benguet]] Mummies, or [[Ibaloi]] Mummies, are a group of [[mummies]] found along the mountain slopes of  [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], a town in the northern part of the Philippines. They were made from as early as 2000 BC until the 16th century, when [[Spain]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]]. Today, they remain in natural [[caves]] and a museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]].

== Description ==

[[Scientists]] believe that the Fire Mummies were created by the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] between 1200 and 1500 [[AD]] in five towns in [[Benguet]] and buried in [[caves]]. Others believe that the process of [[mummification]] began at 2000 [[Before Christ|BC]].&lt;ref name="made"/&gt; What makes the Fire Mummies unique is their process of [[mummification]]. That mummification began shortly before a person [[death|died]], where he would [[digestion|digest]] a very salty drink. After his death, his [[corpse]] was washed and set over a [[fire]] in a seated position, thus drying the fluids. [[Smoke]] from [[tobacco]] was blown into the [[mouth]] to dry the body's inside and [[Organ (anatomy)|internal organs]]. Eventually, herbs were rubbed into the body.&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/fire-mummies-of-the-philippines |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Dylan |author2=Treeswithknees |author3=Nicholas Jackson |website=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mummified bodies are then placed in a coffin made of pinewood and laid to rest in rock shelters, natural caves or man made burial niches.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2070/|title = Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves|date = |accessdate = September 13, 2014|website = |publisher = UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of that mummification ended, since [[Spaniards]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonized the Philippines]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="made"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |title=Kabayan Mummies |at=When were they made |website=Mummy Tombs |accessdate=21 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001028161032/http://www.mummytombs.com/mummylocator/group/kabayan.htm |archivedate=28 October 2000 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discovery ===

When the Fire Mummies were 'discovered' in the early 20th century by Westerners (the mummies have been known to local communities for hundreds of years), many of them were [[Grave robbery|stolen]], because the [[caves]] were mostly unprotected. Because of this, Monument Watch, a [[nonprofit organization]], declared the site as one of the 100 most endangered sites in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paperdue.com/essay/Fire-Mummies-of-the-6468 |title=Fire Mummies of the Philippines |author=Paperdue |date=November 2010 |website=PaperDue.com |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==

After [[logging]] operations intensified in the area, the location of many [[caves]] became known. Unfortunately this has led to [[looting]], as unconscientious visitors have been eager to leave their mark, including [[graffiti]], on the Kabayan mummies. The Kabayan Mummies were listed in the [[1998 World Monuments Watch]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]]. Funding through [[American Express]] was used for emergency conservation and the creation of a comprehensive management plan. Additionally, local authorities from surrounding municipalities collaborated in cultural awareness campaign to introduce the Mummies to [[Filipino people|Filipinos]]. [[tourism|Tourist]] facilities were also constructed in order to control visitation and prevent harmful intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmf.org/project/kabayan-mummy-caves |website=World Monuments Fund |title=Kabayan Mummy Caves |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fire Mummies remain in natural [[caves]] with relatively small security and have been designated as one of the 100 world's most endangered heritage sites. Officials know 50-80 other mummies, but they will not give their locations because of their fear of [[vandalism]]. A small museum in [[Kabayan, Benguet|Kabayan]], [[Benguet]] also displays a few mummies.&lt;ref name="making"/&gt;

== Declarations ==
The Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves are listed as National Cultural Treasures by the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 374. It is also under consideration as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Scholars are also pushing for the inclusion of the mummy burial caves in neighboring [[Buguias, Benguet|Buguias]] town in the ''Kabayan Mummy Burial Caves'' nomination of the Philippines in the UNESCO Tentative List. The caves in Buguias is home to one of Benguet's folk hero, Apo Anno. The burial caves in Kabayan and Buguias will collectively be called as the Benguet Mummy Burial Caves or Mummy Burial Caves in Kabayan and Buguias.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Legal psychology''' involves [[empirical]], [[psychology|psychological]] research of the law, legal institutions, and people who come into contact with the law. Legal psychologists typically take basic social and cognitive principles and apply them to issues in the legal system such as [[eyewitness memory]], jury decision-making, investigations, and interviewing. The term "legal psychology" has only recently come into usage, primarily as a way to differentiate the [[experimental research|experimental]] focus of legal psychology from the [[clinical psychology|clinically]]-oriented [[forensic psychology]].

Together, legal psychology and forensic psychology form the field more generally recognized as "psychology and law". Following earlier efforts by psychologists to address legal issues, psychology and law became a field of study in the 1960s as part of an effort to enhance justice, though that originating concern has lessened over time.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis R. Fox]] (1999). [http://dennisfox.net/papers/injustice.html Psycholegal Scholarship's Contribution to False Consciousness About Injustice.]''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 23,'' 9-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division 41, the [[American Psychology-Law Society]], is active with the goal of promoting the contributions of [[psychology]] to the understanding of [[law]] and [[legal system]]s through [[research]], as well as providing education to psychologists in legal issues and providing  education to legal personnel on psychological issues. Further, its mandate is to  inform the psychological and legal communities and the public at large  of current research, educational, and service in the area of psychology and law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ap-ls.org/
|title=American Psychology and the Law Society
|accessdate=2007-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are similar societies in Britain and Europe.

==Areas of research==
Generally speaking, any research that combines psychological principles with legal applications or contexts could be considered legal psychology (although research involving [[clinical psychology]], e.g., mental illness, [[competency evaluation (law)|competency]], [[insanity defense]], [[offender profiling]], etc., is typically categorized as [[forensic psychology]], and not legal psychology). For a time, legal psychology researchers were primarily focused on issues related to [[eyewitness testimony]] and jury decision-making; so much so, that the editor of ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', the premier legal psychology journal, implored researchers to expand the scope of their research and move on to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael J. Saks]] (1986). The Law Does Not Live on Eyewitness Testimony Alone. ''[[Law and Human Behavior]], 10'', 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several legal psychology [[academic journal|journal]]s, including ''[[Law and Human Behavior]]'', ''[[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]]'', ''Psychology, Crime, and Law'', and ''Journal of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law'' that focus on general topics of [[criminology]], and the [[criminal justice system]]. In addition, research by legal psychologists is regularly published in more general journals that cover both basic and applied research areas.

In March 1893 J. McKeen Cattell posted questions to fifty-six of his students at Columbia University, the questions he asked his students were comparable to those asked in a court of justice. What he found was that it was reasonable to conclude eyewitness accounts of events were unreliable. His students were all sure they were mostly correct, even when they weren’t, and some were hesitant when they were in fact correct.  He could not figure out specifically why each student had inaccurate testimonies. Cattell suggested that “an unscrupulous attorney” could discredit a witness who is being truthful by asking “cunningly selected questions”. Although a jury, or the judge, should know how normal errors are in eyewitness testimonies given different conditions. However, even Cattell was shocked by the level of incorrectness displayed by his students. Cattell’s research has been depicted as the foundation of forensic psychology in the United States. His research is still widely considered a prevailing research interest in legal psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been thought that in America psychologists have been used as expert witnesses in court testimonies since the early 1920’s. Consultation within civil courts was most common, during this time criminal courts rarely consulted with psychologists. Psychologists were not considered medical experts, those who were like, physicians and psychiatrists, in the past were the ones consulted for criminal testimonies. This could be because in criminal cases, the defendant's mental state almost never  mattered "As a general rule, only medical men — that is, persons licensed by law to practice the profession of medicine — can testify as experts on the question of insanity; and the propriety of this general limitation is too patent to permit discussion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1118348419Psychol|title=The Handbook of Forensic Psychology, 4th Edition|last=Irving Weiner|last2=Randy Otto|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and education==
Legal psychologists typically hold a [[PhD]] in some area of psychology (e.g., [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]], etc.), and apply their knowledge of that field to the law. Although formal legal training (such as a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] or Master of Legal Studies degree) can be beneficial, most legal psychologists hold only the PhD. In fact, some argue{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} that specialized legal training dilutes the psychological empiricism of the researcher. For instance, to understand how eyewitness memory "works", a psychologist should be concerned with memory processes as a whole, instead of only the aspects relevant to the law (e.g., lineups, accuracy of testimony).

A growing number of universities offer specialized training in legal psychology as either a standalone [[PhD]] program or a joint [[Juris Doctor|JD]]/PhD program. A list of American universities that offer graduate training in legal psychology can be found [http://ap-ls.org/education/GraduatePrograms.php here] on the website of the [http://www.ap-ls.org/ American Psychology-Law Society].

==Roles of a legal psychologist==
===Academics and research===
Many legal psychologists work as [[professors]] in university psychology departments, criminal justice departments or law schools. Like other professors, legal psychologists generally conduct and publish empirical research, teach various classes, and mentor graduate and undergraduate students. Many legal psychologists also conduct research in a more general area of psychology (e.g., social, clinical, cognitive) with only a tangential legal focus. Those legal psychologists who work in law schools almost always hold a [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in addition to a [[PhD]]

===Expert witnesses===
{{Main|Expert witness}}
Psychologists specifically trained in legal issues, as well as those with no formal training, are often called by legal parties to testify as expert witnesses. In criminal trials, an expert witness may be called to testify about eyewitness memory, [[mistaken identity]], competence to stand trial, the propensity of a [[death-qualified jury]] to also be "pro-guilt", etc. Psychologists who focus on clinical issues often testify specifically about a defendant's competence, intelligence, etc. More general testimony about perceptual issues (e.g., adequacy of police sirens) may also come up in trial.

Experts, particularly psychology experts, are often accused of being "hired guns" or "stating the obvious".{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Eyewitness memory experts, such as [[Elizabeth Loftus]], are often discounted by judges and lawyers with no empirical training because their research utilizes undergraduate students and "unrealistic" scenarios.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} If both sides have psychological witnesses, jurors may have the daunting task of assessing difficult scientific information.

===Policy making and legislative guidance===
Psychologists employed at public policy centers may attempt to influence legislative policy or may be called upon by state (or national) lawmakers to address some policy issue through empirical research. A psychologist working in public policy might suggest laws or help to evaluate a new legal practice (e.g., eyewitness lineups).&lt;ref&gt;Examples of legal psychologists in these positions can be found at the [[American Bar Foundation]] ([http://www.abf-sociolegal.org/ Website]) and [[Federal Judicial Center]] ([http://www.fjc.gov Website]), among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advisory roles===
Legal psychologists may hold advisory roles in court systems. They may advise legal decision makers, particularly judges, on psychological findings pertaining to issues in a case. The psychologist who acts as a court adviser provides similar input to one acting as an expert witness, but acts out of the domain of an [[adversarial system]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm Court Appointed Scientific Expert Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229052858/http://www.aaas.org/spp/case/case.htm |date=2008-02-29 }}, [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amicus briefs===
Psychologists can provide an [[amicus brief]] to the court. The [[American Psychological Association]] has provided briefs concerning mental illness, retardation and other factors. The amicus brief usually contains an opinion backed by scientific citations and statistics. The impact of an amicus brief by a psychological association is questionable. For instance, Justice Powell&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0435_0223_ZC2.html Ballew v. Georgia&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; once called a reliance on statistics "numerology" and discounted results of several empirical studies. Judges who have no formal scientific training also may critique experimental methods, and some feel that judges only cite an amicus brief when the brief supports the judge's personal beliefs.

===Trial consulting===
Some legal psychologists work in [[trial consulting]]. No special training nor certification is needed to be a trial consultant, though an advanced degree is generally welcomed by those who would hire the trial consultant. The American Society of Trial Consultants does have a code of ethics for members, but there are no legally binding ethical rules for consultants.&lt;ref&gt;An overview of the trial consulting process is provided by the [[American Society of Trial Consultants]], [http://www.astcweb.org/ ASTC Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists who work in academics are hired as trial consultants when their expertise can be useful to a particular case. Other psychologists/consultants work for or with established trial consultant firms. The practice of law firms hiring "in-house" trial consultants is becoming more popular, but these consultants usually can also be used by the firms as practicing attorneys.

Trial consultants perform a variety of services for lawyers, such as picking jurors (usually relying on in-house or published statistical studies) or performing "mock trials" with focus groups. Trial consultants work on all stages of a case from helping to organize testimony, preparing witnesses to testify, [[scientific jury selection|picking juries]], and even arranging "shadow jurors" to watch the trial unfold and provide input on the trial. There is some debate on whether the work of a trial consultant is protected under attorney-client privilege, especially when the consultant is hired by a party in the case and not by an attorney.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15112">'''Neural facilitation''', also known as '''paired pulse facilitation''' ('''PPF'''), is a phenomenon in [[neuroscience]] in which postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) ([[End-plate potential|EPPs]], [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|EPSPs]] or [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|IPSPs]]) evoked by an impulse are increased when that impulse closely follows a prior impulse. PPF is thus a form of short-term [[synaptic plasticity]].

==Mechanisms==

===Overview===

{{chem|Ca|2+}} plays a significant role in transmitting signals at [[chemical synapses]]. [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|Voltage-gated {{chem|Ca|2+}} channels]] are located within the presynaptic terminal. When an [[action potential]] invades the presynaptic membrane, these channels open and {{chem|Ca|2+}} enters. A higher concentration of {{chem|Ca|2+}} enables [[synaptic vesicles]] to fuse to the presynaptic membrane and release their contents ([[neurotransmitters]]) into the [[synaptic cleft]] to ultimately contact receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. The amount of neurotransmitter released is correlated with the amount of {{chem|Ca|2+}} influx. Therefore, short-term facilitation (STF) results from a build up of {{chem|Ca|2+}} within the [[presynaptic terminal]] when action potentials propagate close together in time.&lt;ref name = Purves&gt;{{cite book | last = Purves | first = Dale | last2 = Augustine | first2 = George J. | last3 = Fitzpatrick | first3 = David | last4 = Hall | first4 = William C. | last5 = LaMantia | first5 = Anthony-Samuel | last6 = While | first6 = Leonard E. | title = Neuroscience | publisher = Sinauer | edition = 5th| year = 2012 | location = Sunderland, MA | isbn = 978-0-87893-695-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation of excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) can be quantified as a ratio of subsequent EPSC strengths.  Each EPSC is triggered by pre-synaptic calcium concentrations and can be approximated by:

EPSC = k([{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;presynaptic&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = k([{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; + [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; + [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;residual&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Where k is a constant.

Facilitation = EPSC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / EPSC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 + [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;residual&lt;/sub&gt; / [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; - 1

===Experimental evidence===
Early experiments by Del Castillo &amp; Katz in 1954 and Dudel &amp; Kuffler in 1968 showed that facilitation was possible at the neuromuscular junction even if transmitter release does not occur, indicating that facilitation is an exclusively presynaptic phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Del Castillo | first1=J | last2=Katz | first2=B | title=Statistical factors involved in neuromuscular facilitation and depression | journal=J. Physiol. | volume=124 | year=1954 | pages=574–585 | pmid=13175200 | issue=3 | pmc=1366293 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1954.sp005130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dudel | first1=J | last2=Kuffler | first2=SW | title=Mechanism of facilitation at the crayfish neuromuscular junction | journal=J. Physiol. | volume=155 | year=1961 | pages=530–542 | pmid=13724751 | pmc=1359873 | issue=3 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1961.sp006645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katz and Miledi proposed the '''residual {{chem|Ca|2+}} hypothesis.''' They attributed the increase in neurotransmitter release to residual or accumulated {{chem|Ca|2+}} ("active calcium") within the axon membrane that remains attached to the membrane's inner surface.&lt;ref name = katz&gt;{{Citation | last1=Katz | first1=B | last2=Miledi | first2=R | title=The role of calcium in neuromuscular facilitation | journal=J. Physiol. | volume=195 | year=1968 | pages=481–492 | pmid=4296699 | issue=2 | pmc=1351674 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1968.sp008469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katz and Miledi manipulated the {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration within the presynaptic membrane to determine whether or not residual {{chem|Ca|2+}} remaining within the terminal after the first impulse caused an increase in neurotransmitter release following the second stimulus.

During the first nerve impulse, {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration was either significantly below or nearing that of the second impulse. When {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration was approaching that of the second impulse, facilitation was increased. In this first experiment, stimuli were presented in intervals of 100&amp;nbsp;ms between the first and second stimuli. An absolute [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] was reached when intervals were about 10&amp;nbsp;ms apart.

To examine facilitation during shorter intervals, Katz and Miledi directly applied brief [[depolarizing]] stimuli to nerve endings. When increasing the depolarizing stimulus from 1-2&amp;nbsp;ms, neurotransmitter release greatly increased due to accumulation of active {{chem|Ca|2+}}. Therefore, the degree of facilitation depends on the amount of active {{chem|Ca|2+}}, which is determined by the reduction in {{chem|Ca|2+}} conductance over time as well as the amount of  removed from axon terminals after the first stimulus. Facilitation is greatest when the impulses are closest together because {{chem|Ca|2+}} conductance would not return to baseline prior to the second stimulus. Therefore, both {{chem|Ca|2+}} conductance and accumulated {{chem|Ca|2+}}  would be greater for the second impulse when presented shortly after the first.

In the [[Calyx of Held]] synapse, short term facilitation (STF) has been shown to result from the binding of residual {{chem|Ca|2+}} to neuronal {{chem|Ca|2+}}  sensor 1 (NCS1). Conversely, STF has been shown to decrease when {{chem|Ca|2+}} chelators are added to the synapse (causing [[chelation]]) which reduce residual {{chem|Ca|2+}}. Therefore, "active {{chem|Ca|2+}}" plays a significant role in neural facilitation.&lt;ref name=Xu&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jianhua  | first1=Xu | last2=Liming | first2= He| last3=Ling-Gang | first3= Wu | title=Role of Ca2+ channels in short-term synaptic plasticity | journal= Current Opinion in Neurobiology| volume=17 | issue=3 | year=2007 | pages=352–9 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2007.04.005 |pmid=17466513 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-4388(07)00059-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the synapse between [[Purkinje cells]], short-term facilitation has been shown to be entirely mediated by the facilitation of {{chem|Ca|2+}} currents through the [[voltage-dependent calcium channels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Díaz-Rojas|first1=Françoise|last2=Sakaba|first2=Takeshi|last3=Kawaguchi|first3=Shin-Ya|title=Ca(2+) current facilitation determines short-term facilitation at inhibitory synapses between cerebellar Purkinje cells.|journal=Journal of Physiology|date=Nov 15, 2015|volume=593|issue=22|pages=4889–904|doi=10.1113/JP270704|pmid=26337248|pmc=4650412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other forms of short-term synaptic plasticity==

=== Augmentation and potentiation ===
Short-term synaptic enhancement is often differentiated into categories of '''facilitation''', '''[[synaptic augmentation|augmentation]]''', and '''[[post-tetanic potentiation|potentiation]]''' (also referred to as '''post-tetanic potentiation''' or '''PTP''').&lt;ref name = Zucker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Thomson
 | first = Alex M.
 | title = Facilitation augmentation and potentiation at central synapses
 | journal = Trends in Neurosciences
 | volume = 23
 | issue = 7
 | pages = 305–312
 | year = 2000 |pmid=10856940  |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-2236(00)01580-0
 | doi=10.1016/s0166-2236(00)01580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three processes are often differentiated by their time scales: facilitation usually lasts for tens of milliseconds, while augmentation acts on a time scale on the order of seconds and potentiation has a time course of tens of seconds to minutes. All three effects increase the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic membrane, but the underlying mechanism is different for each. Paired-pulse facilitation is caused by the presence of residual {{chem|Ca|2+}}, augmentation likely arises due to increased action of the presynaptic protein munc-13, and post-tetanic potentiation is mediated by presynaptic activation of protein kinases.&lt;ref name = Purves /&gt; The type of synaptic enhancement seen in a given cell is also related to variant dynamics of {{chem|Ca|2+}} removal, which is in turn dependent upon the type of stimuli; a single action potential leads to facilitation, while a short tetanus generally causes augmentation and a longer tetanus leads to potentiation.&lt;ref name = Zucker /&gt;

=== Short-term depression (STD) ===
Short-term depression (STD) operates in the opposite direction of facilitation, decreasing the amplitude of PSPs. STD occurs due to a decrease in the readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP) as a result of frequent stimulation. The inactivation of presynaptic {{chem|Ca|2+}} channels after repeated action potentials also contributes to STD.&lt;ref name=Xu /&gt; Depression and facilitation interact to create short-term plastic changes within neurons, and this interaction is called the '''dual-process theory of plasticity'''. Basic models present these effects as additive, with the sum creating the net plastic change (facilitation - depression = net change). However, it has been shown that depression occurs earlier on in the stimulus-response pathway than facilitation, and therefore plays into the expression of facilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prescott|first=Steven|title=Interactions between Depression and Facilitation within Neural Networks: Updating the Dual-Process Theory of Plasticity|journal=Learning &amp; Memory|date=May 2012|volume=19|issue=5|pages=446–466|doi=10.1101/lm.5.6.446|doi-broken-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many synapses exhibit properties of both facilitation and depression. In general, however, synapses with low initial probability of vesicle release are more likely to exhibit facilitation, and synapses with high probability of initial vesicle release are more likely to exhibit depression.&lt;ref name = "SynapticComputation" /&gt;

==Relation to information transmission==

===Synaptic filtering===
Because the probability of vesicle release is activity-dependent, synapses can act as dynamic filters for information transmission.&lt;ref name="SynapticComputation" /&gt; Synapses with a low initial probability of vesicle release act as [[high-pass filters]]: because the release probability is low, a higher-frequency signal is needed to trigger release, and the synapse thus selectively responds to high-frequency signals. Likewise, synapses with high initial release probabilities serve as [[low-pass filters]], responding to lower-frequency signals. Synapses with an intermediate probability of release act as [[band-pass filters]] that selectively respond to a specific range of frequencies. These filtering characteristics may be affected by a variety of factors, including both PPD and PPF, as well as chemical [[neuromodulator]]s. In particular, because synapses with low release probabilities are more likely to experience facilitation than depression, high-pass filters are often converted to band-pass filters. Likewise, because synapses with high initial release probabilities are more likely to undergo depression than facilitation, it is common for low-pass filters to become band-pass filters, as well. Neuromodulators, meanwhile, may affect these short-term plasticities. In synapses with intermediate release probabilities, properties of the individual synapse will determine how the synapse changes in response to stimuli. These changes in filtration affect information transmission and encoding in response to repeated stimuli.&lt;ref name = "SynapticComputation" /&gt;

===Sound-source localization===
In humans, [[sound localization]] is primarily accomplished using information about how the intensity and timing of a sound vary between each ear. Neuronal computations involving these interaurual intensity differences (IIDs) and [[interaural time difference]]s (ITDs) are typically carried out in different pathways in the brain.&lt;ref name=macleod&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacLeod | first = KM | title= Short-term synaptic plasticity and intensity coding |journal= Hearing Research|year=2011|volume=279| issue = 1–2 |pages=13–21 | doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.001| pmid = 21397676 | pmc = 3210195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term plasticity likely assists in differentiating between these two pathways: short-term facilitation dominates in intensity pathways, while short-term depression dominates in temporal pathways. These different types of short-term plasticity allow for different kinds of information filtration, thus contributing to the division of the two kinds of information into distinct processing streams.

The filtering capabilities of short-term plasticity may also assist with encoding information related to amplitude modulation.&lt;ref name = macleod /&gt; Short-term depression can dynamically adjust the gain on high-frequency inputs, and may thus allow for an expanded high-frequency range for AM. A mixture of facilitation and depression may also assist in AM coding by leading to rate filtering.

'''OPC Unified Architecture''' ('''OPC UA''') is a [[machine to machine]] [[communication protocol]] for [[industrial automation]] developed by the [[OPC Foundation]]. Distinguishing characteristics are:
* Focus on communicating with industrial equipment and systems for data collection and control
* [[open standard|Open]] - freely available and implementable under GPL 2.0 license &lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/license/gpl.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cross-platform]] - not tied to one operating system or programming language
* [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA)
* Inherent complexity - the specification consists of 1250 pages in 14 documents
* Robust [[Information security|security]]
* Integral [[information model]], which is the foundation of the infrastructure necessary for information integration where vendors and organizations can model their complex data into an OPC UA namespace to take advantage of the rich service-oriented architecture of OPC UA. There are over 35 collaborations with the OPC Foundation currently. Key industries include [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]], [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]], [[building automation]], [[industrial robotics]], security, manufacturing and [[process control]].

== History ==
Although developed by the same organization, OPC UA differs significantly from its predecessor, [[Open Platform Communications]] (OPC). The Foundation's goal for OPC UA was to provide a path forward from the original [[OLE for process control|OPC]] communications model (namely the [[Microsoft Windows]]-only process exchange COM/[[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]]) that would better meet the emerging needs of [[industrial automation]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahnke, Wolfgang; Leitner, Stefan-Helmut https://library.e.abb.com/public/75d70c47268d78bfc125762d00481f78/56-61%203M903_ENG72dpi.pdf OPC Unified Architecture - The future standard for communication and information modeling in automation], 3/2009 [http://www.abb.com/abbreview ABB Review 3/2009, page 56-61]&lt;/ref&gt;

After more than three years of specification work and another year for a prototype implementation, the first version of the Unified Architecture was released in 2006.

The current version of the specification is on 1.04 (22 Nov 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/specifications-unified-architecture&lt;/ref&gt;). The new version of OPC UA now has added publish/subscribe in addition to the client/server communications infrastructure.

== Innovations ==
Although the original binding to COM/[[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] helped [[OLE for process control|OPC]] to distribute well, it had several drawbacks:
* Frequent configuration issues with DCOM;
* No configurable time-outs;
* [[Microsoft Windows]] only;
* Lower security;
* No control over DCOM (COM/DCOM is kind of a black box, developers have no access to sources and therefore have to deal with bugs or insufficient implementations).

These drawbacks along with a number of other considerations pushed the decision to develop a new and independent stack for OPC UA, which replaces COM/DCOM. The main characteristics of this communication stack were:
* Multi-platform implementation, including portable [[ANSI C]], [[Java (software platform)|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]] implementations;
* Scalability: from smart sensors and smart actuators to mainframes;
* Multi-threaded, as well as single-threaded/single-task operation&amp;mdash;necessary for porting the stack to embedded devices;
* Security, based on new standards;
* Configurable time-outs for each service;
* Chunking of big datagrams.

This communication stack reflects the beginning of various innovations. The OPC UA architecture is a service-oriented architecture (SOA) and is based on different logical levels.

OPC Base Services are abstract method descriptions, which are protocol independent and provide the basis for OPC UA functionality. The transport layer puts these methods into a protocol, which means it serializes/deserializes the data and transmits it over the network.
Two [[communication protocol|protocols]] are specified for this purpose. One is a binary [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] protocol, optimized for high performance and the second is [[Web service]]-oriented.

The OPC information model is a so-called Full Mesh Network based on [[node (networking)|node]]s. These nodes can include any kind of meta information, and are similar to the objects of [[object-oriented programming]] (OOP). A node can have attributes for read access (DA, HDA), methods that can be called (Commands), and triggered events that can be transmitted (AE, DataAccess, DataChange). Nodes hold process data as well all other types of [[metadata]]. The OPC namespace contains the type model.

Client software can verify what Profiles a server supports. This is necessary to obtain information, if a server only supports DA functionality or additionally AE, HDA, etc. Additionally, information can be obtained about whether a server supports a given profile. New and important features of OPC UA are:
* '''Redundancy''' support
* '''Heartbeat''' for connections in both directions (to indicate whether the other end is "alive"). This means that both server and client recognize interrupts.
* '''Buffering''' of data and acknowledgements of transmitted data. Lost connections don't lead to lost data anymore. Lost datagrams can be refetched.

At the OPC UA DevCon in October 2006 in Munich the first prototypes were presented live. Various UA Servers have been shown on a [[Beckhoff]] [[programmable logic controller]] and an embedded test board from Euros. The Beckhoff PLC is based on Windows XP Embedded and the embedded controller is based on the [[real-time operating system]] Euros. The company Embedded Labs Ltd demonstrated an OPC-UA Server based on their own C++ UA Stack executing on a single chip [[ARM Holdings|ARM]] microcontroller with 64kB [[RAM]]. In October 2012 the German Fraunhofer-Application Center IOSB-INA and the Institute for industrial Information Technologies (inIT) shows, that an OPC-UA server is scalable downto 15 kB RAM and 10 kB ROM and therefore usable at chip level.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hs-owl.de/init/en/aktuelles/news/news-detail/news/the-worlds-smallest-opc-ua-server-comes-from-germany.html The world's smallest OPC-UA server comes from Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocols==
OPC UA supports two protocols.&lt;ref&gt;Leitner, Stefan-Helmut; Mahnke, Wolfgang [http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/stt/26_4/01_Fachgruppenberichte/ORA2006/07_leitner-final.pdf OPC UA – Service-oriented Architecture for Industrial Applications], 11/2006 [http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/stt/index.html Softwaretechnik-Trends] {{ISSN|0720-8928}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is visible to application programmers only via changes to the URL. The binary protocol is '''opc.tcp://Server''' and '''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://Server&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' is for Web Service. Otherwise OPC UA works completely transparent to the [[Application programming interface|API]].

The binary protocol offers the best performance/least overhead, takes minimum resources (no XML Parser, [[SOAP]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] required, which is important for embedded devices), offers best interoperability (binary is explicitly specified and allows fewer degrees of freedom during implementation) and uses a single arbitrarily choosable TCP port for communication easing tunneling or easy enablement through a firewall.

The Web Service (SOAP) protocol is best supported from available tools, e.g., from Java or .NET environments, and is firewall-friendly, using standard HTTP(S) ports.

Binary is supported by all implementations, while only .NET implementation supports SOAP.

==Specifications==
The OPC UA specification is a multi-part specification and consists of the following parts:
# Concepts
# Security Model
# Address Space Model
# Services
# Information Model
# Mappings
# Profiles
# Data Access
# Alarms and Conditions
# Programs
# Historical Access
# Discovery
# Aggregates
# PubSub

In contrast to the COM-based specifications, the UA specifications are not pure application specifications. They describe typically UA internal mechanisms, which get handled through the communication stack and are normally only of interest for those that port a stack to a specific target or those that want to implement their own UA stack.

The OPC UA application developers code against the OPC UA API and therefore mainly use API documentation. Nevertheless, part 3, 4, and 5 may be of interest for application developers.&lt;ref&gt;Massaro, Simone [http://www.plantengineering.com/index.php?id=1792&amp;cHash=081010&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=35007 What is OPC UA and how does it affect your world?], 5/15/2008 [http://www.plantengineering.com planetengineering.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
The OPC-UA protocol specification consists of 14 documents for a total of 1250 pages. Due to this complexity, existing implementations are usually incomplete. In addition, the existence of several serialization formats, as well as the possibility of selectively implementing certain services such as PubSub, eventually lead to a great heterogeneity of the OPC-UA connection points. Under these conditions, it is finally difficult to develop client applications that are independent of the specific implementation of each server. In this sense, OPC-UA does not achieve its promise of ensuring good interoperability of systems. This can be seen typically in factory and infrastructure projects integrating various PLC technologies, each delivered with a different and limited implementation of the OPC-UA protocol.

The specification is still evolving, the last specification document volume 14 is dated February 6, 2018, while the first publication of the standard OPC-UA dates from 2006.

As a result, despite considerable marketing efforts to support its adoption, OPC-UA may be considered at this stage as a standardization attempt rather than an established standard.

==UA communication stack==
The architecture of a UA application, independent of whether it is the server or client part, is structured into levels.

Some parts equalize to the former COM Proxy/Stubs and get provided by the OPC Foundation. The portability level is new; it simplifies porting the UA ANSI C stack also to other target platforms. A port layer for Windows and [[Linux]] gets also provided by the OPC Foundation.

==UA security==
UA Security consists of authentication and authorization, encryption and data integrity via signatures. For Web Services the [[WS-SecureConversation]] gets used and is therefore compatible to [[.NET Framework|.NET]] and other [[SOAP]] implementations. For the binary variant, the algorithms of WS-SecureConversation have been followed and also converted to a binary equivalent. This is named as UA Secure Conversation.

There is also a mixed version where the code is binary, but the transport layer is SOAP. This is a compromise between efficient binary coding and firewall-friendly transmission. Binary coding always requires UA Secure Conversation.
The authentication uses [[X.509]] certificates exclusively. It relies on the application developer to choose which certificate store the UA application gets bound to. For instance, it is possible to use the [[public key infrastructure]] (PKI) of an [[Active Directory]].

==OPC UA APIs==
UA APIs are available in several programming languages. Commercial SDK are available for C, C++, Java, and .NET. Open-source stacks are available at least for C, C++, Java, Javascript(node) and Python [https://github.com/open62541/open62541/wiki/List-of-Open-Source-OPC-UA-Implementations].

==C++ Implementation==
* The [https://github.com/open62541/open62541 open62541] project provides an Open Source implementation for OPC UA server and clients and is licensed under the [[Mozilla Public License]] v2.0. Besides Linux and Windows, it also supports OS X, QNX and different embedded systems as compilation target.
* The ASNeG project provides a C++ open source (Apache License 2.0) OPC UA Application Server and an OPC UA Web Server (beta state, currently only base functions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asneg.de |title=ASNeG – open source OPC UA Application Server | accessdate=2015-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [https://freeopcua.github.io/ FreeOpcUa] project provides an open source ([[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]]) server and client implementation in C++.
* The [https://github.com/uaf/uaf UAF] project offers an open source (LGPL) C++/Python implementation .

==.NET implementation==
The .NET implementation uses ANSI C for the lower levels and implements the rest natively in .NET. That means only the handling of the socket and the Message-Chunking gets integrated from the ANSI C stack. De-serialization takes place directly in .NET and therefore gets converted directly into .NET structures and objects. This provides better performance than de-serializing into a C structure first and then copying the data to a .NET structure afterwards.

==Java implementation==
Various stacks for Java were being developed. Similar to .NET, there are principally three variants:
#Encapsulate the complete ANSI C stack via [[Java Native Interface|JNI]], which complicates portability. Although the stack can be ported to different operating systems, it needs to get compiled for those individually. Also, the data needs to get copied to the JNI boundary, but benefits from the performance of C during de-serialization.
#Code directly on the network layer (similar to the current .Net implementation) and de-serialize in Java. This saves one data copy execution, but still depends on the C stack.
#Write a native Java OPC UA stack. This was observed to be the most portable, but estimated to take the most engineering effort to implement. The Eclipse Milo project provides a pure-Java, open-source, implementation of the UA 1.03 client and server specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/milo |title=OPC Unified Architecture (UA) client and/or server functionality in any JVM-based project |accessdate=22 Aug 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, there is the simple variant to only support the WebService protocol. For that, a SOAP Toolkit that supports [[WS-Security]] is needed.

== Python implementation ==
The [https://freeopcua.github.io/ FreeOpcUa] project provides an implementation entirely in the Python programming language (compatible with Python 2, 3 and pypy) and provides high-level abstractions of an OPC-UA client and server which can be used as is or readily extended for custom applications.

'''Overnutrition''' or '''hyperalimentation''' is a form of [[malnutrition]] in which the intake of nutrients is oversupplied. The amount of nutrients exceeds the amount required for normal growth, development, and [[metabolism]]. 

The term can also refer to:
* [[Obesity]], which occurs by eating more calories than one burns, as well as:
* Oversupplying a ''specific'' nutrient, such as [[dietary minerals]] or [[vitamin poisoning]]. This is  due to an excessive intake or a nutritional imbalance caused by [[fad diet]]s.

For mineral excess, see:
* [[Iron poisoning]], and
* [[Low sodium diet]] (a response to excess sodium).

Overnutrition may also refer to greater [[food]] consumption than appropriate,&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{DorlandsDict|four/000050758|hyperalimentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as other feeding procedures such as [[parenteral nutrition]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10672">In [[physics]], the '''Poincaré recurrence theorem''' states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to, if not exactly the same as, the initial state.  The '''Poincaré recurrence time''' is the length of time elapsed until the recurrence; this time may vary greatly depending on the exact initial state and required degree of closeness. The result applies to isolated mechanical systems subject to some constraints, e.g., all particles must be bound to a finite volume. The theorem is commonly discussed in the context of [[ergodic theory]], [[dynamical systems]] and [[statistical mechanics]].

The theorem is named after [[Henri Poincaré]], who discussed it in 1890&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Poincaré, H. |year=1890|title=Sur le problème des trois corps et les équations de la dynamique|journal= Acta Math. |volume=13|pages=1–270|url=https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.acta/1485881725#toc}} Œuvres VII 262–490 (theorem 1 section 8)&lt;/ref&gt; and proved by [[Constantin Carathéodory]] using [[measure (mathematics)|measure theory]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Carathéodory, C. (1919) "Über den Wiederkehrsatz von Poincaré". ''Berl. Sitzungsber''. 580–584; Ges. math. Schr. IV  296–301&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precise formulation ==
Any [[dynamical system]] defined by an [[ordinary differential equation]] determines a [[flow (mathematics)|flow map]] ''f''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; mapping [[phase space]] on itself. The system is said to be [[volume-preserving]] if the volume of a set in phase space is invariant under the flow. For instance, all [[Hamiltonian system]]s are volume-preserving because of [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]]. The theorem is then: If a [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] preserves volume and has only bounded orbits, then for each open set there exist orbits that intersect the set infinitely often.&lt;ref name="Barreira 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Barreira | first1=Luis | editor1-last=Zambrini | editor1-first=Jean-Claude | title=XIVth International Congress on Mathematical Physics | publisher=[[World Scientific]] | isbn=978-981-256-201-2 | doi=10.1142/9789812704016_0039 | year=2006 | chapter=Poincaré recurrence: old and new | pages=415–422  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussion of proof ==
The proof, speaking qualitatively, hinges on two premises:&lt;ref name="gibbs"&gt;Chapter X of {{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Josiah Willard |authorlink=Josiah Willard Gibbs |title=[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]] |year=1902 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A finite upper bound can be set on the total potentially accessible phase space volume. For a mechanical system, this bound can be provided by requiring that the system is contained in a bounded ''physical'' region of space (so that it cannot, for example, [[escape velocity|eject particles that never return]])—combined with the conservation of energy, this locks the system into a finite region in phase space.
# The phase volume of a finite element under dynamics is conserved. (for a mechanical system, this is ensured by [[Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian)|Liouville's theorem]])

Imagine any finite starting volume of [[phase space]] and follow its path under dynamics of the system. The volume "sweeps" points of phase space as it evolves, and the "front" of this sweeping has a constant size. Over time the explored phase volume (known as a "phase tube") grows linearly, at least at first. But, because the accessible phase volume is finite, the phase tube volume must eventually saturate because it cannot grow larger than the accessible volume. This means that the phase tube must intersect itself. In order to intersect itself, however, it must do so by first passing through the starting volume. Therefore, at least a finite fraction of the starting volume is recurring.

Now, consider the size of the non-returning portion of the starting phase volume—that portion that never returns to the starting volume. Using the principle just discussed in the last paragraph, we know that if the non-returning portion is finite, then a finite part of the non-returning portion must return. But that would be a contradiction, since any part of the non-returning portion that returns, also returns to the original starting volume. Thus, the non-returning portion of the starting volume cannot be finite and must be infinitely smaller than the starting volume itself. [[Q.E.D.]].

The theorem does not comment on certain aspects of recurrence which this proof cannot guarantee:
* There may be some special phases that never return to the starting phase volume, or that only return to the starting volume a finite number of times then never return again. These however are extremely "rare", making up an infinitesimal part of any starting volume.
* Not all parts of the phase volume need to return at the same time. Some will "miss" the starting volume on the first pass, only to make their return at a later time.
* Nothing prevents the phase tube from returning completely to its starting volume before all the possible phase volume is exhausted. A trivial example of this is the [[harmonic oscillator]]. Systems that do cover all accessible phase volume are called [[ergodic hypothesis|ergodic]] (this of course depends on the definition of "accessible volume").
* What ''can'' be said is that for "almost any" starting phase, a system will eventually return arbitrarily close to that starting phase. The recurrence time depends on the required degree of closeness (the size of the phase volume). To achieve greater accuracy of recurrence, we need to take smaller initial volume, which means longer recurrence time.
* For a given phase in a volume, the recurrence is not necessarily a periodic recurrence. The second recurrence time does not need to be double the first recurrence time.

== Formal statement of the theorem ==
Let 
:&lt;math&gt;(X,\Sigma,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;

be a finite [[measure space]] and let 
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X\to X&lt;/math&gt;

be a [[measure-preserving transformation]]. Below are two alternative statements of the theorem.

===Theorem 1===
For any &lt;math&gt;E\in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the set of those points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; for which there exists &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f^n(x)\notin E&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; has zero measure. That is, almost every point of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; returns to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. In fact, almost every point returns infinitely often; ''i.e.''

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\left(\{x\in E:\text{ there exists } N \text{ such that }
f^n(x)\notin E \text{ for all } n&gt;N\}\right)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

For a proof, see {{planetmath reference|id=6035|title=proof of Poincaré recurrence theorem 1}}.

===Theorem 2===
The following is a topological version of this theorem:

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[second-countable]] [[Hausdorff space]] and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; contains the [[Borel sigma-algebra]], then the set of recurrent points of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has full measure. That is, almost every point is recurrent.

For a proof, see {{planetmath reference|id=6036|title=proof of Poincaré recurrence theorem 2}}

== Quantum mechanical version ==
For quantum mechanical systems with discrete energy eigenstates, a similar theorem holds. For every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_0&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a time ''T'' larger than &lt;math&gt; T_0&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;|| \psi(T) \rangle - |\psi(0)\rangle| &lt; \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;| \psi(t)\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the state vector of the system at time&amp;nbsp;''t''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=P. |last=Bocchieri |first2=A. |last2=Loinger |title=Quantum Recurrence Theorem |journal=[[Physical Review|Phys.

The essential elements of the proof are as follows. The system evolves in time according to:

:&lt;math&gt;|\psi(t)\rangle = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n \exp(-i E_n t)|\phi_n\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; are the energy eigenvalues (we use natural units, so &lt;math&gt;\hbar = 1&lt;/math&gt; ), and the &lt;math&gt;|\phi_n \rangle&lt;/math&gt; are the energy eigenstates. The squared norm of the difference of the state vector at time ''&lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;'' and time zero, can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;| |\psi(T) \rangle - |\psi(0)\rangle|^2 = 2\sum_{n=0}^\infty |c_n|^2 [1-\cos(E_n T)]&lt;/math&gt;

We can truncate the summation at some ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''N'' independent of ''T'', because

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=N+1}^\infty |c_n|^2 [1-\cos(E_n T)] \leq 2\sum_{n=N+1}^\infty |c_n|^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be made arbitrarily small because the summation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty |c_n|^2&lt;/math&gt;, being the squared norm of the initial state, converges to&amp;nbsp;1.

That the finite sum
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^N |c_n|^2 [1-\cos(E_n T)]&lt;/math&gt;

can be made arbitrarily small, follows from the existence of integers &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt; such that 
:&lt;math&gt;|E_n T -2\pi k_n|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;

for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that there exists intervals for T on which 
:&lt;math&gt;1-\cos(E_n T)&lt;\frac{\delta^2}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

On such intervals, we have:
:&lt;math&gt;2\sum_{n=0}^N |c_n|^2 [1-\cos(E_n T)] &lt; \delta^2 \sum_{n=0}^N |c_n|^2&lt;\delta^2&lt;/math&gt;

The state vector thus returns arbitrarily closely to the initial state, infinitely often.

[[File:Swanage Punch &amp; Judy.JPG|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy booth, at [[Swanage]], Dorset, England]]

'''Punch and Judy''' is a traditional [[puppet]] show featuring Mr. Punch and his wife Judy. The performance consists of a sequence of short scenes, each depicting an interaction between two characters, most typically Mr. Punch and one other character who usually falls victim to Punch's slap stick. It is often associated with traditional [[British culture]].&lt;ref name="British seaside" /&gt; The various episodes of Punch comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—are dominated by the clowning of Mr. Punch.&lt;ref name="350 years"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mr Punch celebrates 350 years of puppet anarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17895716|agency=BBC|date=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is performed by a single puppeteer inside the booth, known since Victorian times as a "professor" or "punchman", and assisted sometimes by a "bottler" who corrals the audience outside the booth, introduces the performance, and collects the money ("the bottle"). The bottler might also play accompanying music or sound effects on a drum or guitar, and engage in back chat with the puppets, sometimes repeating lines that may have been difficult for the audience to understand. In Victorian times, the drum and [[pan pipe]]s were the instruments of choice. Today, the audience is also encouraged to participate, calling out to the characters on the stage to warn them of danger or clue them in to what is going on behind their backs. Also nowadays, most professors work solo, since the need for a bottler became less important when [[busking]] with the show gave way to paid engagements at private parties or public events.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote="[Pulcinella] went down particularly well with Restoration British audiences, fun-starved after years of [[Puritanism]].

The Punch and Judy show has roots in the 16th-century Italian [[commedia dell'arte]]. The figure of Punch is derived from the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] stock character of [[Pulcinella]], which was [[anglicized]] to ''Punchinello''.&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"&gt;{{cite EB1911|last=Wheeler|first=R. Mortimer|wstitle=Punch (puppet)|title=Punch|volume=22|pages=648–649}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a manifestation of the [[Lord of Misrule]] and [[Trickster]] figures of deep-rooted mythologies. Punch's wife was originally called "Joan."
[[File:Punch Plaque Covent Garden.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Plaque commemorating the first recorded performance of Punch and Judy on [[St Paul's, Covent Garden|St Paul's]] in [[Covent Garden]]]]

The figure who later became Mr. Punch made his first recorded appearance in England on 9 May 1662, which is traditionally reckoned as Punch's UK birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Watson. [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2141622/Thats-way-Mr-Punch-celebrates-350-years-recorded-time-diary-Samuel-Pepys.html "That's the way to do it! Mr Punch celebrate 350 years since being recorded for the first time in the diary of Samuel Pepys"], ''The Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt; The diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] observed a [[marionette]] show featuring an early version of the Punch character in [[Covent Garden]] in London. It was performed by Italian puppet showman Pietro Gimonde, a.k.a. "Signor Bologna." Pepys described the event in his diary as "an Italian puppet play, that is within the rails there, which is very pretty."

In the British Punch and Judy show, Punch wears a brightly coloured [[jester]]'s [[motley]] and [[Capotain|sugarloaf hat]] with a tassel. He is a [[hunchback]] whose hooked nose almost meets his curved, jutting chin. He carries a stick (called a slapstick) as large as himself, which he freely uses upon most of the other characters in the show. He speaks in a distinctive squawking voice, produced by a contrivance known as a ''[[swazzle]]'' or ''swatchel'' which the professor holds in his mouth, transmitting his gleeful cackle. This gives Punch a vocal quality as though he were speaking through a [[kazoo]]. So important is Punch's signature sound that it is a matter of some controversy within Punch and Judy circles as to whether a "non-swazzled" show can be considered a true Punch and Judy Show. Other characters do not use the swazzle, so the Punchman has to switch back and forth while still holding the device in his mouth.

In the early 18th century, the marionette theatre starring Punch was at its height, with showman [[Martin Powell (puppetry)|Martin Powell]] attracting sizable crowds at both his ''Punch's Theatre'' at Covent Garden and earlier in provincial [[Bath, Somerset]].&lt;ref name="eb1911-punch"/&gt; Powell has been credited with being "largely responsible for the form taken by the drama of Punch and Judy".&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Powell, Martin|first=Thomas| last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1721, a puppet theatre opened in [[Dublin]] that ran for decades. The cross-dressing actress [[Charlotte Charke]] ran the successful but short-lived Punch's Theatre in the Old Tennis Court at [[St. James's]], [[Westminster]], presenting adaptations of [[Shakespeare]] as well as plays by herself, her father [[Colley Cibber]], and her friend [[Henry Fielding]]. Fielding eventually ran his own puppet theatre under the pseudonym Madame de la Nash to avoid the censorship concomitant with the Theatre [[Licensing Act of 1737]].

Punch was extremely popular in [[Paris]] and, by the end of the 18th century, he was also playing in Britain's American colonies,&lt;!---By the end of the 18th century, Britain didn't HAVE any American colonies---&gt; where even [[George Washington]] bought tickets for a show. However, marionette productions were expensive and cumbersome to mount and transport, presented in empty halls, the back rooms of [[taverns]], or within large tents at England's yearly agricultural events at [[Bartholomew Fair]] and [[Mayfair]]. In the latter half of the 18th century, marionette companies began to give way to glove-puppet shows, performed from within a narrow, lightweight booth by one puppeteer, usually with an assistant, or "bottler," to gather a crowd and collect money. These shows might travel through country towns or move from corner to corner along busy London streets, giving many performances in a single day. The character of Punch adapted to the new format, going from a stringed comedian who might say outrageous things to a more aggressive glove-puppet who could do outrageous—and often violent—things to the other characters. About this time, Punch's wife's name changed from "Joan" to "Judy."
[[File:Punch and Judy Thornton Hough.jpg|thumb|left|A Punch and Judy show attracts a family audience In [[Thornton Hough]], Merseyside, England]]

The mobile puppet booth of the late 18th- and early 19th-century Punch and Judy [[Hand puppet|glove-puppet]] show was originally covered in checked bed ticking or whatever inexpensive cloth might come to hand. Later Victorian booths were gaudier affairs, particularly those used for Christmas parties and other indoor performances. In the 20th century, however, red-and-white-striped puppet booths became iconic features on the beaches of many English seaside and summer holiday resorts. Such striped cloth is the most common covering today, wherever the show might be performed.

A more substantial change came over time to the show's [[target audience]]. The show was originally intended for adults, but it changed into primarily a children's entertainment in the late Victorian era. Ancient members of the show's cast ceased to be included, such as the [[Devil]] and Punch's mistress "Pretty Polly," when they came to be seen as inappropriate for young audiences.

The story changes, but some phrases remain the same for decades or even centuries. For example, Punch dispatches his foes each in turn and still squeaks his famous catchphrase: "''That's'' the way to do it!"&lt;ref name="350 years" /&gt; The term "pleased as Punch" is derived from Punch and Judy; specifically, Mr. Punch's characteristic sense of gleeful self-satisfaction.

Modern British performances of Punch and Judy are no longer exclusively the traditional [[seaside resort|seaside]] children's entertainments which they had become. They can now be seen at carnivals, festivals, birthday parties, and other celebratory occasions.

==Characters==
[[File:Islington Punch and Judy.JPG|thumb|Punch and Judy, taken in [[Islington]], north London.]]
The characters in a Punch and Judy show are not fixed. They are similar to the cast of a [[soap opera]] or a [[Folklore|folk tale]] such as [[Robin Hood]]: the principal characters must appear, but the lesser characters are included at the discretion of the performer. New characters may be added and older characters dropped as the tradition changes.

Along with Punch and Judy, the cast of characters usually includes their baby, a hungry crocodile, a clown, an officious policeman, and a prop string of sausages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123140814/http://www.speckinspace.com/whatsit/history/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 November 2010 |title=A Brief History of Punch and Judy (with an introduction to the characters) |publisher=Speckinspace.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The devil and the generic hangman [[Jack Ketch]] may still make their appearances but, if so, Punch will always get the better of them. The cast of a typical Punch and Judy show today will include:
* Mr. Punch
* Judy
* The Baby
* The Constable
* Joey the Clown
* The Crocodile
* The Skeleton
* The Doctor

Characters once regular but now occasional include:
* Toby the Dog
* The Ghost
* The Lawyer
* Hector the Horse
* Pretty Polly
* The Hangman (a.k.a. Jack Ketch)
* The Devil
* The Beadle
* Jim Crow  ('The black man')
* Mr. Scaramouche
* The Servant (or 'The Minstrel')
* The Blind Man

Other characters included Boxers, Chinese Plate Spinners, topical figures, a trick puppet with an extending neck (the "Courtier"), and a monkey. A live Dog Toby was once a regular featured novelty routine, sitting on the playboard and performing 'with' the puppets.

==Story==
Glyn Edwards has likened the story of Punch and Judy to the story of [[Cinderella]].&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful"&gt;Edwards, Glyn. (2000) ''Successful Punch and Judy'', Second Edition 2011. Worthing: The Fedora Group. {{ISBN|9780956718914}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that there are parts of the Cinderella story which everyone knows, namely the cruel step sisters, the invitation to the ball, the handsome prince, the fairy godmother, Cinderella's dress turning to rags at midnight, the glass slipper left behind, the prince searching for its owner, and the happy ending. None of these elements can be omitted and the famous story still be told. The same principle applies to Punch and Judy. Everyone knows that Punch mishandles the baby, that Punch and Judy quarrel and fight, that a policeman comes for Punch and gets a taste of his stick, that Punch has a gleeful run-in with a variety of other figures and takes his stick to them all, that eventually he faces his final foe (which might be a hangman, the devil, a crocodile, or a ghost). Edwards contends that a proper Punch and Judy show requires these elements or the audience will feel let down.&lt;ref name="Edwards Glyn Successful" /&gt;

Peter Fraser writes, "the drama developed as a succession of incidents which the audience could join or leave at any time, and much of the show was impromptu."&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Peter (1970) ''Punch and Judy''. London: B.T Batsford. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold Company. {{ISBN|0-7134-2284-X}}. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number: 71-110085. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was elaborated by [[George Speaight]], who explained that the plotline "is like a story compiled in a parlour game of [[Consequences (game)|Consequences]]&amp;nbsp;... the show should, indeed, not be regarded as a story at all but a succession of encounters."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight, George. (1955) ''Punch and Judy: A History'', Revised Edition 1970. London: Studio Vista Ltd. {{ISBN|0-289-79785-3}}. p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Leach makes it clear that "the story is a conceptual entity, not a set text: the means of telling it, therefore, are always variable."&lt;ref&gt;Leach, Robert. (1985) ''The Punch &amp; Judy Show: History, Tradition and Meaning''. London: Batsford Academic and Educational; Athens, Georgia: University of Georgia Press. {{ISBN|0713447842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalind Crone asserts that the story needed to be episodic so that passersby on the street could easily join or leave the audience during a performance.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"&gt;Crone, Rosalind (2006). "Mr and Mrs Punch in Nineteenth-Century England." ''The Historical Journal'', 49(4) pp. 1055–1082.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much emphasis is often placed on the first printed script of Punch and Judy, in 1827. It was based on a show by travelling performer Giovanni Piccini, illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]], and written by [[John Payne Collier]]. This is the only surviving script of a performance, and its accuracy is questioned. The performance was stopped frequently to allow Collier and Cruikshank to write and sketch and, in the words of Speaight, Collier is someone of whom "the full list of his forgeries has not yet been reckoned, and the myths he propagated are still being repeated. (His) 'Punch and Judy' is to be warmly welcomed as the first history of puppets in England, but it is also sadly to be examined as the first experiment of a literary criminal."&lt;ref&gt;Speaight (1970), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale of Punch and Judy varies from puppeteer to puppeteer, as previously with Punchinello and Joan, and it has changed over time. Nonetheless, the skeletal outline is often recognizable. It typically involves Punch behaving outrageously, struggling with his wife Judy and the baby, and then triumphing in a series of encounters with the forces of law and order (and often the supernatural), interspersed with jokes and songs.

===Typical 21st-century performance===
A typical show as performed currently in the UK will start with the arrival of Mr. Punch, followed by the introduction of Judy. They may well kiss and dance before Judy requests Mr. Punch to look after the baby. Punch will fail to carry out this task appropriately. It is rare for Punch to hit his baby these days, but he may well sit on it in a failed attempt to "babysit", or drop it, or even let it go through a sausage machine. In any event, Judy will return, will be outraged, will fetch a stick, and the knockabout will commence. A policeman will arrive in response to the mayhem and will himself be felled by Punch's slapstick. All this is carried out at breakneck farcical speed with much involvement from a gleefully shouting audience. From here on anything goes.

Joey the Clown might appear and suggest, "It's dinner time." This will lead to the production of a string of sausages, which Mr. Punch must look after, although the audience will know that this really signals the arrival of a crocodile whom Mr. Punch might not see until the audience shouts out and lets him know. Punch's subsequent comic struggle with the crocodile might then leave him in need of a Doctor who will arrive and attempt to treat Punch by walloping him with a stick until Punch turns the tables on him. Punch may next pause to count his "victims" by laying puppets on the stage, only for Joey the Clown to move them about behind his back in order to frustrate him. A ghost might then appear and give Mr. Punch a fright before it too is chased off with a [[slapstick]].

In less squeamish times, a hangman would arrive to punish Mr. Punch, only to himself be tricked into sticking his head in the noose. "Do you do the hanging?" is a question often asked of performers. Some will include it where circumstances warrant (such as for an adult audience) but most do not. Some will choose to include it whatever the circumstances and will face down any critics. Finally, the show will often end with the Devil arriving for Mr. Punch (and possibly to threaten his audience as well). Punch—in his final gleefully triumphant moment—will win his fight with the Devil, bring the show to a rousing conclusion, and earn a round of applause.

===Plots reflect their own era===

[[File:Hitler Punch and Judy Show.jpg|thumb|A traditional Punch and Judy show dating from [[World War II]] with the addition of a [[Hitler]] Character as a figure of derision to reflect the times. Taken at the [[History On Wheels Museum]], [[Eton Wick]], UK.]]
Punch and Judy might follow no fixed storyline, as with the tales of Robin Hood, but there are episodes common to many recorded versions. It is these set piece encounters or "routines" which are used by performers to construct their own Punch and Judy shows. A visit to a Punch and Judy Festival at Punch's "birthplace" in London's Covent Garden will reveal a whole variety of changes that are wrung by puppeteers from this basic material. Scripts have been published at different times since the early 19th century, but none can be claimed as the definitive traditional script of Punch and Judy. Each printed script reflects the era in which it was performed and the circumstances under which it was printed.

The various episodes of the show are performed in the spirit of outrageous comedy—often provoking shocked laughter—and are dominated by the anarchic clowning of Mr. Punch. Just as the Victorian version of the show drew on the morality of its day, so also the Punch &amp; Judy College of Professors considers that the 20th- and 21st-century versions of the tale have changed into something akin to a primitive version of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', in which a bizarre family is used as a vehicle for grotesque visual comedy and a sideways look at contemporary society.

{{quote|In my opinion the street Punch is one of those extravagant reliefs from the realities of life which would lose its hold upon the people if it were made moral and instructive. I regard it as quite harmless in its influence, and as an outrageous joke which no one in existence would think of regarding as an incentive to any kind of action or as a model for any kind of conduct. It is possible, I think, that one secret source of pleasure very generally derived from this performance… is the satisfaction the spectator feels in the circumstance that likenesses of men and women can be so knocked about, without any pain or suffering.|[[Charles Dickens]]|Letter to Mary Tyler, 6 November 1849, from ''The [[Letters of Charles Dickens]] Vol V, 1847–1849''}}

An awareness of the prevalence of domestic abuse, and how Punch and Judy could be seen to make light of this, threatened Punch and Judy performances in the UK and other English-speaking countries for a time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Puppet show faces knockout punch? |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/502752.stm |accessdate=3 September 2008 |date=8 November 1999 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the show is having one of its cyclical recurrences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |title=around the world with mr. punch » Silly-Season-On-Sea |publisher=Punchandjudyworld.org |date=14 August 2008 |accessdate=2 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223201406/http://www.punchandjudyworld.org/wwfbloggem/?itemid=134 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can now be seen in [[England]], [[Wales]], and [[Ireland]]—and also in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]] and [[Puerto Rico]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[South Africa]].

==Comedy==
Despite Punch’s unapologetic murders throughout the performances, it is still a comedy. The humour is aided by a few things. Rosalind Crone (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;1065) suggests that, since the puppets are carved from wood, their facial expressions cannot change, but are stuck in the same exaggerated pose, which helps to deter any sense of realism and to distance the audience.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; The use of the swazzle also helps to create humour, and that the swazzled sound of Punch's voice takes the cruelty out of Punch.&lt;ref&gt;Proschan, Frank (1981). "Puppet Voices and Interlocutors: Language in Folk Puppetry." ''The Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 94, No. 374, Folk Drama (Oct.–Dec. 1981), pp.527–555. The American Folklore Society.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Crone, a third aspect that helped make the violence humorous was that Punch's violence toward his wife was prompted by her own violence toward him.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; In this aspect, he retains some of his previous hen-pecked persona. This would suggest that, since Punch was merely acting violently out of self-defence, it was okay. This is a possible explanation for the humour of his violence toward his wife, and even towards others who may have somehow "had it coming."&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006" /&gt; This suggestion better explains the humour of the violence toward the baby. Other characters that had to incur the wrath of Punch varied depending on the punchman, but the most common were the foreigner, the blind man, the publican, the constable, and the devil.&lt;ref name="Crone, Rosalind 2006"/&gt;

==Published scripts==
Punch is primarily an oral tradition, adapted by a succession of exponents from live performances rather than authentic scripts, and in constant evolution. There exist, however, some early published scripts of varying authenticity.

In 1828, the critic [[John Payne Collier]] published a Punch and Judy script under the title ''The Tragical Comedy or Comical Tragedy of Punch and Judy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyrock.com/nadafarm/html/punch_pdf.html |title=Punch &amp; Judy: 1832 Book pdf file |publisher=Spyrock.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was illustrated by the well-known caricaturist [[George Cruikshank]]. Collier said his script was based on the version performed by the "professor" Giovanni Piccini in the early 19th century, and Piccini himself had begun performing in the streets of London in the late 18th century. The Collier/Cruickshank ''Punch'' has been republished in facsimile several times. Collier's later career as a literary forger has cast some doubt on the authenticity of the script, which is rather literary in style and may well have been tidied up from the rough-and-tumble street-theatre original. 

A transcript of a typical Punch and Judy show in [[London]] of the 1840s can be found in [[Henry Mayhew]]'s ''London Labour and the London Poor''.

The '''Société Chimique de France''' ('''SCF''') is a [[learned society]] and [[professional association]] founded in 1857 to represent the interests of French chemists in a variety of ways in local, national and international contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Société Chimique de France (SCF), [http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html   Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409094637/http://www.societechimiquedefrance.fr/fr/missions-de-la-scf.html |date=2010-04-09 }}; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 2009 the organization was known as the '''Société Française de Chimie'''.

==History==
The Society traces its origins back to an organization of young Parisian chemists who began meeting in May 1857 under the name Société Chimique, with the goal of self-study and mutual education.  In 1858 the established chemist [[Adolphe Wurtz]] joined the society, and immediately transformed it into a [[learned society]] modeled after the [[Chemical Society]] of London, which was the precursor of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]. Like its British counterpart, the French association sought to foster the communication of new ideas and facts throughout France and across international borders.&lt;ref name="Lagowski1991"&gt;Lagowski, J. J. (1991). [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/ed068p1  "A British Sesquicentennial,"] ''Journal of Chemical Education,'' Vol 68, No. 1, p. 1; acknowledging the sesquicentennial of The Chemical Society in London, which eventually became the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]; retrieved 2011-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Support for the ''[[Bulletin de la Société Chimique de France|Bulletin de la Société Chimique de Paris]]'' began in 1858.   

In the 21st century, the society has become a member of [[ChemPubSoc Europ]]e, which is an organization of 16 European chemical societies.  This European consortium was established in the late 1990s as many chemical journals owned by national chemical societies were amalgamated.&lt;ref&gt;ChemPubSoc Europe, [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu.html mission]; [http://www.wiley-vch.de/vch/journals/2111/chempubsoc-eu_members.html  participating societies]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 they started [[ChemistryViews]].org, their news and information service for chemists and other scientists worldwide.

===Prizes and awards===
The society acknowledges individual achievement with prizes and awards, including:

'''Source Separated Organics''' (SSO) is the system by which waste generators segregate [[compostable]] materials from other waste streams at the source for separate collection.

==Types of Materials==
Organic materials, such as yard trimmings, food scraps, wood waste, and paper and paperboard products, typically make up about one-third (by weight) of the municipal solid waste stream.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/msw2008rpt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SSO&amp;nbsp;programs depend on the composition of local waste stream, acceptance specifications for the organics processing facility, and collection methods. The types of organic materials collected include:

* '''Yard and landscaping debris''': floral trimmings, tree trimmings, leaves, grass, brush, and weeds
* '''Food waste''': organic residues generated by the handling, storage, sale, preparation, cooking, and serving of foods, including fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, seafood, shellfish, bones, rice, beans, pasta, bakery items, cheese, eggshells, and coffee grounds
* '''Paper fibers''': waxed cardboard, napkins, paper towels, uncoated paper plates, tea bags, coffee filters, wooden crates, and greasy pizza boxes
* '''Wood waste''': urban wood waste, woody debris from suburban land clearing, and rural forestry residuals

==Programs==
SSO programs have been launched in a wide range of venues, including single-family residential units, commercial businesses, events, food processors, schools, hospitals, and airports. The [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has assembled tools and resources for food waste management to assist communities interested in launching their own food waste reduction and collection efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 1994 |title=Composting Yard Trimmings and Municipal Solid Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/rrr/composting/pubs/cytmsw.pdf |publisher= |page= |docket=EPA530-R-94-003 |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSO&amp;nbsp;materials are typically collected in wet-strength paper bags, unlined plastic bins, or compostable film-plastic liners that meet ASTM 6400 standards.

==Benefits==
The organic fraction of the waste stream is increasingly viewed as a resource.  The resulting products – renewable energy and compost – benefit the environment: reduce greenhouse gas emissions; reduce dependency on foreign energy imports; increase the nutrient composition of our soils; reduce the amount of waste going to landfills; reduce the amount of wet, sloppy waste going to other methods of disposal; reduce the [[leachate]] associated with [[stormwater]] management at landfills; reduce the [[greenhouse gas emissions]] from uncontrolled landfill operations; improve erosion and stormwater control through biofiltration (Schwab, 2000).

==Barriers to adoption==
Communities and businesses that want to implement SSO programs face a few challenges. First, they need participation at the source of their organic waste generation. Second, they need a [[hauler]] willing to collect the organic waste. Third, they need a composting facility permitted to process the material. These challenges have been overcome by many successful SSO programs. Tactics for addressing barriers to adoption include creating outreach and education materials,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopwaste.org/docs/foodscrap_pitch_2_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cetonline.org/Publications/res-schools-online.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/compost/compost_pdf/schmanual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; forging partnerships between local businesses to share fixed collection costs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jgpress.com/archives/_free/000496.html&lt;/ref&gt; and creating incentives for organic diversion through regulated tip fees for solid waste and organics.

==Processing==
Organic materials collected in SSO programs typically get delivered to composting facilities where the waste is turned into nutrient-rich soil amendments known as [[compost]]. Organic feedstock can also be delivered to anaerobic digestion facilities that produce [[biogas]], a source of [[renewable energy]].
Anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of MSW Municipal Solid Waste has been found to be in a number of LCA&amp;nbsp;analysis studies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idosi.org/gjer/gjer3(3)09/4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_34_3_11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to be more environmentally effective, than landfill, incineration or [[pyrolysis]]. The resulting biogas (methane) can then be used for cogeneration (electricity and heat preferably on or close to the site of production) and can be used in gas combustion engines or turbines. With further upgrading to synthetic natural gas it can be injected into the natural gas network or further refined to [[hydrogen]] for use in stationary cogeneration fuel cells.

'''Synaptic stabilization''' is crucial in the developing and adult nervous systems and is considered a result of the late phase of [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP). The mechanism involves strengthening and maintaining active [[synapses]] through increased expression of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix elements and postsynaptic [[scaffold protein]]s, while pruning less active ones. For example, [[cell adhesion molecules]] (CAMs) play a large role in synaptic maintenance and stabilization. [[Gerald Edelman]] discovered CAMs and studied their function during development, which showed CAMs are required for [[cell migration]] and the formation of the entire nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rutishauser U, Jessell TM | title = Cell adhesion molecules in vertebrate neural development | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 68 | issue = 3 | pages = 819–57 | date = July 1988 | pmid = 3293093 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.1988.68.3.819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gerald M.

== Types of CAMs ==

===SynCAMs===

Synaptic cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a crucial role in axon pathfinding and synaptic establishment between neurons during [[neurodevelopment]] and are integral members in many synaptic processes including the correct alignment of pre- and post-synaptic [[signal transduction pathways]], vesicular recycling in regards to [[endocytosis]] and [[exocytosis]], integration of postsynaptic receptors and  anchoring to the [[cytoskeleton]] to ensure stability of synaptic components &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bukalo|first1=Olena|last2=Dityatev|first2=Alexander|title=Synaptic Plasticity Dynamics Development and Disease|date=27 December 2012|publisher=Springer, Vienna|location=Vienna|isbn=978-3-7091-0932-8|pages=97–128|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-7091-0932-8_5|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SynCAM’s (also known as Cadm or nectin-like molecules) are a specific type of synaptic CAM found in [[vertebrates]] that promotes growth and stabilization of excitatory (not inhibitory) synapses. SynCAM’s are localized primarily in the [[brain]] at both pre- and postsynaptic sites and their structures consist of intracellular FERM and PDZ binding domains, a single transmembrane domain, and three extracellular [[immunoglobulin domains|Ig-domains]]. During neurodevelopment, SynCAMs such as SynCAM1 act as “contact sensors” of axonal [[growth cones]] accumulating rapidly when axo-dendritic connections are made and helping to form a stable [[adhesion]] complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biederer|first1=Thomas|last2=Missler|first2=Markus|last3=Südhof|first3=Thomas|title=Synaptic Cell Adhesion|url=http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/4/4/a005694.long|website=Cold Springs Harbor Perspectives in Biology|publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

synCAM1 along with [[neuroligin]] are the two CAM’s known to be sufficient to initiate the formation of presynaptic terminals, as addition of synCAM1 to media of co-cultured neuronal and non-neuronal cells lead to the establishment of presynaptic terminals. Homophillic binding of two synCAM1 molecules on the filopodia of axonal growth cone and dendritic spine allow for initial contact between pre- and postsynaptic cell to be made.

synCAMs belong to the [[immunoglobulin superfamily|Ig superfamily]] of proteins. The cytosolic PDZ domains of synCAMs imbedded in the post-synaptic membrane interact with post-synaptic scaffold protein [[PSD-95]] which helps anchor the complex to the underlying cytoskeleton.

===Cadherin-catenin===
[[File:Localization of cadherin-catenin.jpg|thumb|Temporal and spatial distribution of N-cadherin complexes in the developing and mature synapse]]
[[Cadherin]]s are calcium- dependent, homophilic [[cell adhesion molecules]] that form complexes with cytosolic partners known as [[catenin]]s.&lt;ref name="Bamji_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bamji SX | title = Cadherins: actin with the cytoskeleton to form synapses | journal = Neuron | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–8 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 16039559 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2005.06.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Components of this complex bind to a number of different scaffolding proteins, phosphotases, kinases, and receptors.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; Classical cadherins have five extracellular repeating structures which bind calcium, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail with a distal cytosolic domain that binds a catenin partner.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arikkath J, Reichardt LF | title = Cadherins and catenins at synapses: roles in synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 487–94 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18684518 | pmc = 2623250 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2008.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seong_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seong E, Yuan L, Arikkath J | title = Cadherins and catenins in dendrite and synapse morphogenesis | journal = Cell Adhesion &amp; Migration | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 202–13 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25914083 | pmc = 4594442 | doi = 10.4161/19336918.2014.994919 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has implicated the cadherin-catenin complex in a number of different central nervous system processes such as synaptic stabilization and [[Synaptic plasticity|plasticity]].&lt;ref name="Bamji_2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seong_2015" /&gt;

Many cadherins in the [[Cns|CNS]] exhibit distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; For example, [[CDH2|N-cadherin]] is widely expressed at the developing synapse and later remains near the mature active zone implicating that this complex may be well-suited to provide a link between structural changes and synaptic stability.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; In fact, local synaptic activity changes impact the expression of the [[Cadherin–catenin complex in learning and memory|cadherin-catenin]] complexes.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; An increase in activity at a particular [[Dendritic spine|spine]] leads to the dimerization of N-cadherin which is then cleaved leading the repression of CBP/[[CREB in cognition|CREB]] transcription.&lt;ref name="Arikkath_2008" /&gt; This repression has many developmental and plasticity related implications.

In the case of [[dendritic spine]] formation and [[Synaptic pruning|pruning]], a competition hypothesis has been proposed and corroborated.&lt;ref name="Whalley_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whalley K | title = Neural development: a complex competition for spines | journal = Nature Reviews. Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 577 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26307326 | doi = 10.1038/nrn4024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bian_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bian WJ, Miao WY, He SJ, Qiu Z, Yu X | title = Coordinated Spine Pruning and Maturation Mediated by Inter-Spine Competition for Cadherin/Catenin Complexes | journal = Cell | volume = 162 | issue = 4 | pages = 808–22 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26255771 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.07.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that relative levels of cadherin-catenin complexes, which are distributed amongst spines in a local area in an activity-dependent manner, determines the fate of individual spines. That is, the inter-spine competition for β-catenin determines whether a spine will be matured (increased number of complexes) or pruned (decreased number of complexes).&lt;ref name="Bian_2015" /&gt; This is a critical mechanism during the refinement of cortical circuitry that occurs throughout development.&lt;ref name="Whalley_2015" /&gt;

===Nectin===

[[Nectin]]s are a distinct family of [[cell adhesion molecules]].  These CAMs are involved in the initial contact of [[Chemical synapse|presynaptic]] and postsynaptic neuronal processes during synapse formation.  There are only four well characterized Nectins at the [[synapse]], they are Nectin-1, 2, 3, and 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanes |first=Dan | name-list-format = vanc |title=Development of the Nervous System | edition = 3rd |publisher=Elsevier |date=January 25, 2011 | isbn =978-0-08-092320-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; All [[Cell Membrane|membrane]] bound Nectins possess an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like loops.  The furthest loop from the membrane is called the V-type loop and the two loops more interior are C2-type loops.  Multiple Nectins on one cell membrane will bind together at the V-type loop to form a cluster of Nectin proteins, a process called Cis-Clustering.  When two cells possessing individual Cis-Clusters come into contact they form a strong complex called a Trans-Interaction which provides adhesion and, in some cases, signaling between the two cells.&lt;ref name = "Irie_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irie K, Shimizu K, Sakisaka T, Ikeda W, Takai Y | title = Roles and modes of action of nectins in cell-cell adhesion | journal = Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 6 | pages = 643–56 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15561584 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2004.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most robust knowledge of Nectin’s role in synaptic stabilization comes from the synapses made between [[Mossy fiber (hippocampus)|Mossy Fiber]] terminals and [[Pyramidal cell]] dendrites in the CA3 region of the [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name = "Rikitake_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rikitake Y, Mandai K, Takai Y | title = The role of nectins in different types of cell-cell adhesion | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 16 | pages = 3713–22 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 23027581 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.099572 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nectins involved in formation and stabilization of this synapse are Nectin-1 and Nectin-3 which protrude from the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell and presynaptic cell, respectively, forming heterophilic [[extracellular]] contacts.  The intracellular domain of all Nectins directly bind to a protein called L-[[MLLT4|Afadin]].  L-Afadin is an [[actin]] binding protein that binds to the F-actin of the actin [[cytoskeleton]].  In this way, Nectins form ridged connections of the cells actin architecture allowing for the synapse to develop in a controlled and stable environment.&lt;ref name = "Takai_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takai Y, Shimizu K, Ohtsuka T | title = The roles of cadherins and nectins in interneuronal synapse formation | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 520–6 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14630213 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2003.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As synapses mature in the CA3 region of the Hippocampus, Nectins and Cadherins, which affiliate closely with one another in synaptic stabilization, are shifted to the periphery of the [[active zone]] and form the Puncta Adherentia Junction (PAJ).  The PAJ functions much like [[Adherens junction]]s in [[Epithelium|epithelial]] [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].  The displacement of these CAMs and the formation of this junction provides the nascent synaptic membranes room to interact and mature while partitioning off the surrounding membrane and providing cytoskeletal fixation.&lt;ref name="Irie_2004"/&gt;

===Neurexin-neuroligin===
[[Neurexin]]-[[Neuroligin]] interactions help establish the trans-synaptic functional asymmetry essential for the stabilization and maintenance of proper [[synaptic transmission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Craig AM, Kang Y | title = Neurexin-neuroligin signaling in synapse development | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–52 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17275284 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2007.01.011 | pmc = 2820508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presynaptic neurexin and its postsynaptic binding partner, neuroligin, complex early in neural development and are both known to be potent inducers of [[synaptogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dean C, Dresbach T | title = Neuroligins and neurexins: linking cell adhesion, synapse formation and cognitive function | journal = Trends in Neurosciences | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–9 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16337696 | doi = 10.1016/j.tins.2005.11.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-neuronal cells that artificially express neurexin are sufficient to mobilize post-synaptic specializations in co-cultured neurons;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nam CI, Chen L | title = Postsynaptic assembly induced by neurexin-neuroligin interaction and neurotransmitter | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 17 | pages = 6137–42 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15837930 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0502038102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; neuroligin-expressing cells are likewise able to induce markers of pre-synaptic differentiation in neighboring neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic neurochemistry : principles of molecular, cellular, and medical neurobiology| first1 = Scott T | last1 = Brady | first2 =  George J | last2 = Siegel | first3 = R Wayne | last3 = Albers | first4 = DL | last4 = Price | name-list-format = vanc | isbn=978-0-12-374947-5|edition=Eighth|location=Waltham, Massachusetts|oclc=754167839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Missler M, Südhof TC, Biederer T | title = Synaptic cell adhesion | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = a005694 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22278667 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a005694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while both play an important role in synaptogenesis, these [[cell adhesion molecule]] are not necessary for formation of neuronal connections during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = A Short History of the Synapse – Golgi Versus Ramón y Cajal | title = The Sticky Synapse | last1 = Hortsch | first1 = Michael | editor-last1 = Hortsch | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Umemori | editor-first2 = Hisashi | name-list-format = vanc |date=2009|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-92707-7|pages=1–9|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-92708-4_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A triple [[knockout mouse]] mutant of either neurexins or neuroligins exhibit a normal number of synapses but express an embryonic lethal phenotype due to impairment of normal synaptic transmission.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Missler M, Zhang W, Rohlmann A, Kattenstroth G, Hammer RE, Gottmann K, Südhof TC | title = Alpha-neurexins couple Ca2+ channels to synaptic vesicle exocytosis | journal = Nature | volume = 423 | issue = 6943 | pages = 939–48 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12827191 | doi = 10.1038/nature01755 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, they are not necessary for synapse formation ''per se'' but are essential for the maturation and integration of synapses into the functional circuits necessary for survival.

Beyond their extracellular contact with each other, neurexins and neuroligins also bind intracellularly to a vast network of [[Signal transducing adaptor protein|adaptor protein]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and scaffolding structures, which in concert with the [[actin cytoskeleton]], help localize necessary components of synaptic transmission. For example, the first neuroligin ([[NLGN1]]) discovered was identified by its [[PDZ domain]] which binds to [[Psd95|PSD95]], a well-known a [[scaffold protein]] at [[Glutamatergic neurotransmission|glutamatergic synapses]] that functionally links [[NMDA receptor]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to the proper post-synaptic locale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of neuroscience|date=2009|publisher=Academic Press| last = Squire | first = Larry R. | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=978-0-08-096393-8|location=Amsterdam|oclc=503584095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, another isoform of neuroligin ([[NLGN2]]) interacts with [[gephyrin]], a scaffolding protein specific to [[GABA|GABA-ergic synapses]], and is responsible for activation of the synaptic adapator protein [[collybistin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang C, Atasoy D, Araç D, Yang X, Fucillo MV, Robison AJ, Ko J, Brunger AT, Südhof TC | title = Neurexins physically and functionally interact with GABA(A) receptors | journal = Neuron | volume = 66 | issue = 3 | pages = 403–16 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20471353 | pmc = 3243752 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2010.04.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of neurexins, their intracellular binding interactions are equally as important in recruiting the essential machinery for synaptic transmission at the active zone. Like neuroligins, neurexins possess a PDZ-domain that associates with [[CASK]] ([[Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase]]).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to phosphorylating itself and neurexin, CASK promotes interactions between neurexins and actin binding proteins, thus providing a direct link by which neurexin can modulate cytoskeletal dynamics that is essential for synaptic stability and plasticity. Neurexin can also bind [[Synaptotagmin 1|synaptotagmin]], a protein embedded in the membrane of synaptic vesicles, and can also promote associations with [[voltage-gated calcium channel]] which mediate the ion flux required for [[neurotransmitter]] [[exocytosis]] upon synaptic stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hata Y, Davletov B, Petrenko AG, Jahn R, Südhof TC | title = Interaction of synaptotagmin with the cytoplasmic domains of neurexins | journal = Neuron | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–15 | date = February 1993 | pmid = 8439414 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this way, neurexin and neuroligin coordinate the morphological and functional aspects of the synapse which in turn permits nascent, immature contacts to stabilize into full-fledged functional platforms for neurotransmission.

===Ephrin-Eph signaling===
[[File:Ephrin Signaling.png|thumb|Ephrin A3/EphA4 signaling initiates a cascade of events that results in that regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.]]
Non-traditional adhesion molecules, such as the [[ephrin]]s, also help stabilize synaptic contacts. [[Eph receptor]]s and their membrane bound ligands, the ephrins, are involved in a variety of cellular processes during development and maturation including [[axon guidance]], [[neuronal migration]], [[synaptogenesis]], and [[axon pruning]].&lt;ref name="lisbeth"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lisabeth EM, Falivelli G, Pasquale EB | title = Eph receptor signaling and ephrins | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = a009159 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24003208 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a009159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bianchi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bianchi|first1=Lynne | name-list-format = vanc |title=Developmental Neurobiology|date=2018|publisher=Garland Science|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780815344827|pages=299–302|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[hippocampus]], [[dendritic spine]] [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] may be regulated by [[astrocytes]] via bi-directional ephrin/EphA signaling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolton MM, Eroglu C | title = Look who is weaving the neural web: glial control of synapse formation | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 491–7 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19879129 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2009.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Astrocytes and their processes express [[ephrin A3]], whereas the EphA4 receptor is enriched in hippocampal neurons. This interaction, mediated by ephrin A3/EphA4 signaling, induces the recruitment and activation of [[cyclin-dependent kinase 5]] (Cdk5), which then phosphorylates the [[guanine exchange factor]] (GEF), ephexin1.&lt;ref name="rubenstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubenstein|first1=John | name-list-format = vanc |title=Cellular Migration and Formation of Neuronal Connections: Comprehensive Developmental Neuroscience|date=May 2013|publisher=Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|location=San Diego, CA|isbn=978-0-12-397266-8|pages=659–669|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorylated ephexin1 can then activate the small [[GTPase]], [[RhoA]], leading to subsequent activation of its effector, [[Rho-kinase]] (ROCK),  which results in the rearrangement of actin filaments.&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt; Through this mechanism, astrocytic processes are able to stabilize individual dendritic protrusions as well as their maturation into spines via ephrin/EphA signaling. Forward signaling involving the activation of EphA4 results in the stabilization of synaptic proteins at the [[neuromuscular junction]].&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt; As in the EphA4/ephrinA3-mediated neuron–glia interaction, this process regulates dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton by activating ROCK through ephexin.&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt;

Ephrin B/EphB signaling is also involved in synaptic stabilization through different mechanisms. These molecules contain cytoplasmic tails which interact with scaffolding proteins via their [[PDZ domain|PDZ]] domains to stabilize newly formed CNS synapses.&lt;ref name="bianchi"/&gt; For example, [[Ephrin B3]] interacts with the adaptor protein glutamate-receptor-interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) to regulate the development of excitatory dendritic shaft synapses.&lt;ref name="bianchi"/&gt; This process, which was identified in cultures of hippocampal neurons, revealed that Eph/ephrin B3 reverse signaling recruits GRIP1 to the membrane of the postsynaptic shaft.&lt;ref name="mara"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flannery DB | title = Nondisjunction in Down syndrome | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 181–2 | date = September 1988 | pmid = 2975924 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1973910 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once at the membrane shaft, GRIP1 helps anchor glutamate receptors below the presynaptic terminal. This process also involves the phosphorylation of a serine residue near the ephrin-B [[carboxyl terminus]] (proximal to the PDZ-binding motif) that leads to the stabilization of [[AMPA]] receptors at synapses.&lt;ref name="lisbeth"/&gt;

Another mechanism, found in hippocampal neurons, revealed that EphB signaling could promote spine maturation by modulating Rho GTPase activity, as observed with EphAs.&lt;ref name="aoto"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lerner AM | title = Viral myocarditis as an incidental discovery | journal = Hospital Practice | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 81–4, 87–90 | date = October 1990 | pmid = 2170431 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2006.11.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike EphAs, however, the [[EphB2]] receptor has been shown to interact with the postsynaptic [[N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors]] (NMDARs) to recruit the GEF Tiam1 to the complex upon ephrinB binding.&lt;ref name="aoto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rubenstein"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dina"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arvanitis D, Davy A | title = Eph/ephrin signaling: networks | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 416–29 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18281458 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1630408 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphorylation of Tiam1 occurs in response to NMDAR activity, which allows for the influx of calcium that activates Tiam1. This mechanism also results in the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. As a result of this stabilization, both EphB2 forward signaling and ephrin-B3 reverse signaling has been found to induce LTP via NMDARs.&lt;ref name="yang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lundgren A, Tibbling L, Henriksson NG | title = DC-determined displacement of the nystagmus beat in rotatory tests | journal = Practica Oto-Rhino-Laryngologica | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–64 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 5795627 | doi = 10.3892/etm.2018.5702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teachers Without Borders''' (''TWB'') is an international organization launched in 2000, with a mission to connect teachers to information and each other in order to close the education divide and based  upon the premise that teachers are community change agents and key catalysts of global development priorities. The organization was founded by [http://www.teacherswithoutborders.org/founder/ Dr. Fred Mednick]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} 

Teachers Without Borders received the '''[https://luxembourgpeaceprize.org/laureates/outstanding-peace-education/2018-teachers-without-borders/ 2018 Luxembourg Peace Prize]''' for Outstanding Peace Education, recognized for a free Peace Education program involving teachers from regions in conflict, for having embedded peace education into all TWB courses (see below), and its Voice of Teachers Radio Show in Nigeria. 

Teachers Without Borders received the [https://www.changemakers.com/champions-quality-education-africa '''Champions of African Education Award'''] (2010) for its use of radio and local educational capacity building to disseminate information about the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In 2018, TWB's membership has reached 177 countries. Teachers Without Borders membership is free and enables local educators the opportunity to connect with colleagues globally.

Teachers Without Borders also received the '''[http://peacesymposium.org.uk/the-ahmadiyya-muslim-peace-prize Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize]''' for "outstanding work in the promotion of peace through efforts to convene teachers from regions in conflict, provide unfettered access to courses and networks devoted to teacher professional development, and to ensure that peace education is integrated into all initiatives. The formal announcement can be viewed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viaSBMQxcAk&amp;t=9s '''here'''].

==Approach==
Teachers Without Borders claims that teachers represent the largest professional community in the world (over 65 million); that teachers are uniquely suited as local leaders to recognize and help address development needs; that professional isolation and inconsequential or missing teacher professional development undermines social change; and that the transformation of pre-service and in-service teacher development can bring about more sustainable, equitable, democratic, and economically stable societies.

==Initiatives and Courses==
Teachers Without Borders' initiatives and courses are offered in various formats and settings: online, in schools, as community workshops, in books and journals, and on the radio. All programs have been conceived and led by Teachers Without Borders' members and partners around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11863">In [[computability theory]] and [[computational complexity theory]], an '''undecidable problem''' is a [[decision problem]] for which it is proved to be impossible to construct an [[algorithm]] that always leads to a correct yes-or-no answer. The [[halting problem]] is an example: there is no algorithm that correctly determines whether arbitrary programs eventually halt when run. 

== Background ==
A decision problem is any arbitrary yes-or-no question on an infinite set of inputs.  Because of this, it is traditional to define the decision problem equivalently as the set of inputs for which the problem returns ''yes''. These inputs can be natural numbers, but also other values of some other kind, such as [[string (computer science)|string]]s of a [[formal language]]. Using some encoding, such as a [[Gödel numbering]], the strings can be encoded as natural numbers.  Thus, a decision problem informally phrased in terms of a formal language is also equivalent to a set of [[natural numbers]].  To keep the formal definition simple, it is phrased in terms of subsets of the natural numbers.

Formally, a decision problem is a subset of the natural numbers. The corresponding informal problem is that of deciding whether a given number is in the set. A decision problem ''A'' is called decidable or effectively solvable if ''A'' is a [[recursive set]]. A problem is called partially decidable, '''semi-decidable''', solvable, or provable if ''A'' is a [[recursively enumerable set]]. This means that there exists an algorithm that halts eventually when the answer is ''yes'' but may run for ever if the answer is ''no''. Partially decidable problems and any other problems that are not decidable are called undecidable.

==Example: the halting problem in computability theory==
In [[computability theory]], the [[halting problem]] is a [[decision problem]] which can be stated as follows:

:Given the description of an arbitrary [[computer program|program]] and a finite input, decide whether the program finishes running or will run forever.

[[Alan Turing]] proved in 1936 that a general [[algorithm]] running on a [[Turing machine]] that solves the halting problem for ''all'' possible program-input pairs necessarily cannot exist. Hence, the halting problem is ''undecidable'' for Turing machines.

==Relationship with Gödel's incompleteness theorem==
The concepts raised by [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]s are very similar to those raised by the halting problem, and the proofs are quite similar. In fact, a weaker form of the First Incompleteness Theorem is an easy consequence of the undecidability of the halting problem. This weaker form differs from the standard statement of the incompleteness theorem by asserting that a complete, [[Consistency proof|consistent]] and [[Soundness|sound]] [[axiomatization]] of all statements about natural numbers is unachievable. The "sound" part is the weakening: it means that we require the axiomatic system in question to prove only ''true'' statements about natural numbers. It is important to observe that the statement of the standard form of Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem is completely unconcerned with the question of truth, but only concerns the issue of whether it can be [[mathematical proof|proven]].

The weaker form of the theorem can be proved from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows. Assume that we have a consistent and complete [[axiomatization]] of all true [[first-order logic]] statements about [[natural number]]s. Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements. This means that there is an algorithm ''N''(''n'') that, given a natural number ''n'', computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers such that, for all the true statements, there is at least one ''n'' such that ''N''(''n'') yields that statement. Now suppose we want to decide if the algorithm with representation ''a'' halts on input ''i''.  We know that this statement can be expressed with a first-order logic statement, say ''H''(''a'', ''i'').  Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an ''n'' such that ''N''(''n'') =  ''H''(''a'', ''i'') or there is an ''n&amp;#39;'' such that ''N''(''n&amp;#39;'') = ¬ ''H''(''a'', ''i'').  So if we [[iterate]] over all ''n'' until we either find ''H''(''a'', ''i'') or its negation, we will always halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since we know that there cannot be such an algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false.

==Examples of undecidable problems==
{{main|List of undecidable problems}}
Undecidable problems can be related to different topics, such as [[logic]], [[abstract machine]]s or [[topology]]. Note that since there are [[uncountable set|uncountably]] many undecidable problems, any list, even one of [[countably infinite|infinite length]], is necessarily incomplete.

==Examples of undecidable statements==
{{See also|List of statements independent of ZFC|Independence (mathematical logic)}}

There are two distinct senses of the word "undecidable" in contemporary use. The first of these is the sense used in relation to Gödel's theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified [[deductive system]]. The second sense is used in relation to [[computability theory]] and applies not to statements but to [[decision problem]]s, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no [[computable function]] that correctly answers every question in the problem set.  The connection between these two is that if a decision problem is undecidable (in the recursion theoretical sense) then there is no consistent, effective [[formal system]] which proves for every question ''A'' in the problem either "the answer to ''A'' is yes" or "the answer to ''A'' is no".

Because of the two meanings of the word undecidable, the term [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] is sometimes used instead of undecidable for the "neither provable nor refutable" sense. The usage of "independent" is also ambiguous, however. It can mean just "not provable", leaving open whether an independent statement might be refuted.

Undecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does not, in and of itself, address the question of whether the [[truth value]] of the statement is well-defined, or whether it can be determined by other means. Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the statement. Whether there exist so-called "absolutely undecidable" statements, whose truth value can never be known or is ill-specified, is a controversial point among various [[philosophy of mathematics|philosophical schools]].

One of the first problems suspected to be undecidable, in the second sense of the term, was the [[word problem for groups]], first posed by [[Max Dehn]] in 1911, which asks if there is a finitely presented [[group (mathematics)|group]] for which no algorithm exists to determine whether two words are equivalent.  This was shown to be the case in 1952.

The combined work of Gödel and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] has given two concrete examples of undecidable statements (in the first sense of the term): The [[continuum hypothesis]] can neither be proved nor refuted in [[ZFC]] (the standard axiomatization of [[set theory]]), and the [[axiom of choice]] can neither be proved nor refuted in [[Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] (which is all the ZFC axioms ''except'' the axiom of choice).  These results do not require the incompleteness theorem.   Gödel proved in 1940 that neither of these statements could be disproved in ZF or ZFC set theory. In the 1960s, Cohen proved that neither is provable from ZF, and the continuum hypothesis cannot be proven from ZFC.

In 1970, Russian mathematician [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] showed that [[Hilbert's tenth problem|Hilbert's Tenth Problem]], posed in 1900 as a challenge to the next century of mathematicians, cannot be solved.    Hilbert's challenge sought an algorithm which finds all solutions of a [[Diophantine equation]].  A Diophantine equation is a more general case of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]; we seek the [[integer number|integer root]]s of a [[polynomial]] in any number of variables with integer coefficients.  Since we have only one equation but ''n'' variables, infinitely many solutions exist (and are easy to find) in the [[complex plane]]; however, the problem becomes impossible if solutions are constrained to integer values only.  Matiyasevich showed this problem to be unsolvable by mapping a Diophantine equation to a [[recursively enumerable set]] and invoking Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Matiyasevich | first=Yuri | authorlink=Yuri Matiyasevich | year=1970 | script-title=ru:Диофантовость перечислимых множеств |trans-title=Enumerable sets are Diophantine | journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] | volume=191 | pages=279–282 | language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, [[Alan Turing]] proved that the [[halting problem]]—the question of whether or not a [[Turing machine]] halts on a given program—is undecidable, in the second sense of the term. This result was later generalized by [[Rice's theorem]].

In 1973, [[Saharon Shelah]] showed the [[Whitehead problem]] in [[group theory]] is undecidable, in the first sense of the term, in standard set theory.

In 1977, Paris and Harrington proved that the [[Paris-Harrington theorem|Paris-Harrington principle]], a version of the [[Ramsey theorem]], is undecidable in the axiomatization of arithmetic given by the Peano axioms but can be proven to be true in the larger system of [[second-order arithmetic]].

[[Kruskal's tree theorem]], which has applications in computer science, is also undecidable from the Peano axioms but provable in set theory. In fact Kruskal's tree theorem (or its finite form) is undecidable in a much stronger system codifying the principles acceptable on basis of a philosophy of mathematics called predicativism.

[[Goodstein's theorem]] is a statement about the [[Ramsey theory]] of the natural numbers that Kirby and Paris showed is undecidable in Peano arithmetic.

[[Gregory Chaitin]] produced undecidable statements in [[algorithmic information theory]] and proved another incompleteness theorem in that setting. Chaitin's theorem states that for any theory that can represent enough arithmetic, there is an upper bound ''c'' such that no specific number can be proven in that theory to have [[Kolmogorov complexity]] greater than ''c''. While Gödel's theorem is related to the [[liar paradox]], Chaitin's result is related to [[Berry's paradox]].

In 2007, researchers Kurtz and Simon, building on earlier work by [[John Horton Conway|J.H. Conway]] in the 1970s, proved that a natural generalization of the [[Collatz problem]] is undecidable.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Stuart A.; Simon, Janos, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mhrOkx-xyJIC&amp;lpg=PA542&amp;dq=Kurtz%20collatz%20problem&amp;pg=PA542#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The Undecidability of the. Generalized Collatz Problem"], in Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Models of Computation, TAMC 2007, held in Shanghai, China in May 2007. {{isbn|3-540-72503-2}}. {{doi|10.1007/978-3-540-72504-6_49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources at The [[University of Maryland]] is simply the history of the University itself. The University of Maryland was chartered in 1856 as the Maryland Agricultural College.  [[Charles Benedict Calvert]] spent $21,000 to purchase 420 acres in [[College Park, Maryland]], and later that year founded the college. The school opened on October 5, 1859 with a total of 34 students. In 1864, the state legislature designated it as  a [[land grant college]] under the [[Morrill Act of 1862]], which made federal funds available.  
By the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the University, having been hit hard by financial problems and a decline in student enrollment, found itself bankrupt. The state legislature assumed half ownership of the school in 1866, which pulled the college out of bankruptcy, and made the college, in part, a state institution. Enrollment slowly increased at the University, and over the next 26 years Maryland gained a reputation as a strong research institution. The federally funded [[Agricultural Experiment Station]] was established under the [[Hatch Act of 1887]], and new state laws granted the college regulatory control over several areas of agriculture and public safety. The school has grown over the years, adding several other academic departments. However, it still remains a land grant university, and continues to have a strong college of agriculture and natural resources.
