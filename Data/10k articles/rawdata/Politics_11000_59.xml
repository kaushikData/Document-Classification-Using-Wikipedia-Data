'''''Freedom Bell, American Legion''''', is a public artwork located at [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]] in Washington, D.C., United States. ''Freedom Bell, American Legion'' was surveyed as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] American Art Museum's Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture database in 1985.&lt;ref name="Freedom Bell American Legion"&gt;{{Cite web| author=American Art Museum | year=1985 | title=Freedom Bell, American Legion (sculpture)  | work=Inventory of American Sculpture | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!325683~!0#focus | accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The sculpture is a 2:1 scale replica of the [[Liberty Bell]]. The bell, which was founded by Petit und Fritsen, weighs 8 tons and has a support structure of [[Post and lintel|post and beam]] style with two concrete shafts.&lt;ref name="Freedom Bell American Legion"/&gt; A plaque rests on the ground in front of the bell that reads:

:The Freedom Bell

:Dedicated to
:The Spirit of the Bicentennial
:on Behalf of
:The Children of Our Nation
:Given By
:The American Legion
:And
:American Legion Auxiliary

==Information==

The bell, a Bicentennial gift from the [[American Legion]], is a model of the bell on display at the American Legion Headquarters in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. Authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]] on October 12, 1976, it was cast outside of the US because no [[foundry]] had the capacity to cast the bell. 

When the bell was completed it was shipped to [[Baltimore]] and then traveled to all 48 contiguous states aboard the American [[Freedom Train]] for the Bicentennial, starting on April 1, 1975 in Wilmington, DE and ending Dec 31, 1976 in Miami, FL.&lt;ref name="ALHistory"&gt;{{cite web | year=2008 | title=1970s | work=History | publisher=American Legion | url=http://www.legion.org/history | accessdate=January 8, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100106232830/http://www.legion.org/history| archivedate= January 6, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bell shared train car No. 41 (later renumbered 40) with a map of the American Freedom Train's journey and a [[Lunar rover (Apollo)|lunar rover]].&lt;ref name="AFT"&gt;{{cite web | author=Todd Schannuth | year=2011 | title=American Freedom Train Showcase Car #41| work=American Freedom Train | publisher=Accuen Media | url=http://www.freedomtrain.org/american-freedom-train-consist-041.htm | accessdate=January 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977–1978 the bell was placed in [[National Park Service]] storage until lengthy discussions led to an agreement and the bell was placed at Union Station in 1981. The American Legion, who hoped for placement at the [[National Mall]], were unhappy with the bell's placement.&lt;ref name="Freedom Bell American Legion"/&gt;

==Artist==

The details of the casting were handled by I. T. Verdin Company of [[Cincinnati]], Ohio. Jack Patrick served as associate architect for the sculpture and Allen J. Wright Associates created the post and beam support for the bell. The iron work was completed by Fred S. Gichner Iron Works.&lt;ref name="Freedom Bell American Legion"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">The concept of '''armed violence reduction (AVR)''' has gained significant in importance after the [[Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development|2006 Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development]]. According to [[OECD]], more than 740,000 people die each year as a result of the violence associated with [[armed conflict]]s and large- and small-scale [[criminality]]. Furthermore, armed violence impedes humanitarian and socio-economic development and, hence, it is an obstruction to achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDG)]].

== Key numbers on armed violence from the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development ==

* More than 740,000 people have died directly or indirectly from armed violence - both conflict and [[violent crime|criminal violence]] - every year in recent years.
* More than 540,000 of these deaths are violent, with the vast majority occurring in non-conflict settings.
* At least 200,000 people - and perhaps many thousands more - have died each year in conflict zones from non-violent causes (such as [[malnutrition]], [[dysentery]], or other easily preventable diseases) that resulted from the effects of war on populations.
* Between 2004 and 2007, at least 208,300 violent deaths were recorded in armed conflicts - an average of 52,000 people killed per year. This is a conservative estimate including only recorded deaths: the real total may be much higher.
* The annual economic cost of armed violence in non-conflict settings, in terms of lost [[productivity]] due to violent deaths, is [[USD]] 95 billion and could reach as high as USD 163 billion - 0.14 percent of the annual [[global GDP|global]] [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Declaration key numbers: http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Geneva-Declaration-Millennium-Development-Goals.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Armed violence reduction is therefore essential for the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;ɡ&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Birgitta Jónsdóttir''' (born 17 April 1967) is an Icelandic politician, [[Anarchism|anarchist]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/phil-england/rebuilding-democracy-in-iceland-interview-with-birgitta-jonsdottir&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/31/world/europe/icelands-prime-minister-resigns-after-pirate-party-makes-strong-gains.html&lt;/ref&gt; poet, and activist. She was a Member of the [[Althing]] (MP) for the [[Southwest Constituency]] from 2013 to 2017, representing the [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], having been elected at the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 election]]. She was previously an MP for [[Reykjavík Constituency South]] from 2009 to 2013. In November 2017, she has announced to retire from politics "for now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ruv.is/frett/birgitta-haett-i-stjornmalum-i-bili | title=Birgitta hætt í stjórnmálum í bili | accessdate=12 November 2017 | date=11 November 2017 | work=ruv.is | publisher=[[Ríkisútvarpið]] | language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She published her first book of poetry at the age of 22, and later became a web developer. She was a noted Icelandic activist, and took on a number of roles during the protests following the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007-2008 financial crisis]].

She was first elected as an MP representing the [[Citizens' Movement (Iceland)|Citizens' Movement]] in the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]]. Later in 2009, she left the Citizens' Movement and joined [[The Movement (Iceland)|The Movement]]. She became involved with [[WikiLeaks]] during [[Julian Assange]]'s visit to Iceland in 2010, and also helped to produce the [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike|Collateral Murder]] video. Following her time with WikiLeaks, she created the [[International Modern Media Institute]], of which she became executive director in 2011. She was also involved in two court cases in the [[United States]] during her parliamentary term, one of which was the high-profile case [[Hedges v. Obama|''Hedges vs Obama'']]. In 2012, close to the end of her term, she co-founded the Icelandic [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]], becoming their first MP.

In the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 election]], Birgitta was elected as a Pirate Party MP, alongside two others. She was portrayed in the 2013 film about WikiLeaks, [[The Fifth Estate (film)|''The Fifth Estate'']], of which she was critical. She also served as Chairman of the Pirate Party from 2014 to 2015, when they became the most popular party in Iceland.

== Early life ==
Birgitta was born in [[Reykjavík]] on 17 April 1967, the daughter of Icelandic folk singer [[Bergþóra Árnadóttir]] (1948–2007). Her father left the family when she was just a baby, and so she was adopted by her mother's new husband, shipowner and fisherman Jón Ólafsson (1940–1987). She completed her primary school education in 1983.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/is/?nfaerslunr=728|title=Birgitta Jónsdóttir - Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=Althing|publisher=|language=is|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first love, as a teenager, was [[Jón Gnarr]], who went on to become [[Mayor of Reykjavík City|Mayor of Reykjavík]]. They "took drugs together, read anarchist literature and planned to start an Icelandic branch of [[Greenpeace]]." Her adoptive father, Jón Ólafsson, committed [[suicide]] when she was 20 years old by walking into an icy river during a storm.&lt;ref name="need"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Butter|first1=Susannah|title=Everything you need to know about Icelandic Pirate Party leader Birgitta Jónsdóttir|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/everything-you-need-to-know-about-icelandic-pirate-party-leader-birgitta-j-nsd-ttir-a3219381.html|accessdate=22 April 2016|work=[[Evening Standard]]|date=6 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry and activism ==
At the age of 20, her first book of poetry, ''Frostdinglar'', was published. From a young age, she sought to combine art and poetry, "by looking holistically at issues artists could bring new perspectives." Therefore, she styles herself as a 'poetician'. Her art has been exhibited on three different continents, she has performed at lectures and festivals around the world, and her work has been published in anthologies, newspapers, magazines, and on TV, radio and the internet.&lt;ref name="biog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of a MultiArtistActivist|url=http://this.is/birgitta/me/resume.html|website=Birgitta|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, her focus shifted to the internet, saying that "I dove into the internet and haven’t been out of there since." In 1996, she organised Iceland's first live stream using [[CU-SeeMe]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-pirate-partys-poetician-plans-to-make-iceland-a-data-haven|title=The Pirate Party's 'Poetician' Plans to Make Iceland a Data Haven|last=Valentine|first=Ben|date=18 September 2014|work=Motherboard|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, she edited two anthologies, ''The Book of Hope'' and ''The World Healing Book''. She is also a member of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Writers' Union of Iceland|is|3=Rithöfundasamband Íslands}} (RSÍ), and the founder of Radical Creations and Beyond Borders Press.&lt;ref name=biog /&gt;

In an interview with ''Take Part'', Birgitta described how "after the financial collapse I was one of the very few people that was a known protester." She was therefore asked to coordinate various grassroots organisations and organised a large protest in December 2008. She later became a member of the Academia Group, which talked about what kind of government and constitution Iceland required.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2013/10/17/how-wikileaks-changed-my-country-forever|title=Icelandic Activist Birgitta Jónsdóttir Reveals How WikiLeaks Changed Her Country Forever|last=Knight|first=Sam|date=17 October 2013|work=Take Part|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First parliamentary term, 2009–2013 ==
In the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2009|2009 Iceland parliamentary election]], Birgitta was elected as a Member of the [[Althing]] for [[Reykjavík Constituency South]], representing the [[Citizens' Movement (Iceland)|Citizens' Movement]]. Upon her election, she was appointed as a member of the [[Foreign Affairs Committee (Iceland)|Foreign Affairs Committee]], the [[Environment and Communications Committee (Iceland)|Environment and Communications Committee]], and the Icelandic delegation to the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]]. Later, in 2009, she was also appointed as a member of the Parliamentary Review Committee of the SIC Report.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.althingi.is/altext/cv/en/?nfaerslunr=143|title=Birgitta Jónsdóttir|last=|first=|date=|website=Althing|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 August 2009, [[Þráinn Bertelsson]] left the Citizens' Movement to sit as an Independent, and, on 18 September 2009, the remaining three MPs for the Citizens' Movement (Birgitta, [[Margrét Tryggvadóttir]] and [[Þór Saari]]) left the party to form their own parliamentary grouping, [[The Movement (Iceland)|the Movement]].

In 2009, a court injunction prevented broadcasters talking about the recent leak of the details of [[Kaupthing Bank]]'s loansbook. Live on television, [[Bogi Ágústsson]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; directed viewers to the [[WikiLeaks]] website to see for themselves. This created considerable popularity for WikiLeaks in Iceland, and, shortly after the incident, [[Julian Assange]] visited Iceland. During his visit, Birgitta met with him and offered her help. It was agreed that Birgitta should be part of a team to help create a stronger set of free speech laws internationally and, particularly, in Iceland.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Birgitta was also a producer of WikiLeaks' [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike|Collateral Murder]] video, released in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The project for creating stronger free speech laws eventually became known as the [[International Modern Media Institute|International Modern Media Initiative]] (IMMI), which was proposed in February 2010 with Birgitta being the chief sponsor. It was adopted unanimously by the Althing on 16 June 2010, shortly following the release of the Collateral Murder video.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She later split from WikiLeaks, however, saying in September 2010 that "I have strongly urged him to focus on the legalities that he’s dealing with and let some other people carry the torch" following the Swedish police wanting to question Assange over allegations of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/09/03/wikileaks-organizers-demand-julian-assange-step-aside.html|title=Civil War at WikiLeaks|last=Shenon|first=Philip|date=3 September 2010|work=The Daily Beast|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spoke to the ''[[National Post]]'' about WikiLeaks in January 2011, saying: "There is not enough transparency within the organization about decisions and not good enough communication flow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/qa-former-wikileaks-spokeswoman-birgitta-jonsdottir|title=Q&amp;A: Former WikiLeaks spokeswoman Birgitta Jonsdottir|last=McMahon|first=Tamsin|date=15 January 2011|work=National Post|access-date=30 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, she was appointed as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee's Working Group on European Affairs and also the EU-Iceland Joint Parliamentary Committee. In October 2011, she attended a meeting of the [[NATO Parliamentary Assembly]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], where she offered criticisms of [[Michael Jopling, Baron Jopling|Lord Jopling]]'s report on cyber security, writing on her blog that "Apparently such criticism is not common here at the assembly on reports."&lt;ref name="natopa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jonsdottir|first1=Birgitta|title=Nato Parliamentary Assembly in Romania|url=http://joyb.blogspot.co.uk/2011/10/nato-parliamentary-assembly-in-romania.html|website=Birgitta Jonsdottir Official Blogspot|accessdate=3 April 2016|date=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, part way through the parliamentary term, she was demoted from full member to observer status in both the Foreign Affairs Committee and their Working Group on European Affairs. She stopped being a member of the Environment and Communications Committee, and instead became a member of both the [[Judicial Affairs and Education Committee]] and the Special Committee on the Standing Orders of Althing. From 2011 to 2012, she was the rotating chairman of the Movement's overall party.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In 2011, she also became Executive Director of the [[International Modern Media Institute]] (IMMI), that the earlier initiative had transitioned into.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 2012, Birgitta began assisting other The Movement MPs in forming a new political party, [[Dawn (Iceland)|Dawn]]. Dawn was officially formed in March 2012 as a merger between The Movement, the Citizens' Movement and the [[Liberal Party (Iceland)|Liberal Party]]. However, in July 2012, she changed her attention to forming a [[Pirate Party]] in Iceland alongside others, including [[Smári McCarthy]]. Speaking to ''The Grapevine'', she said: "I’m often crossing paths with nerds as I’m such a nerd myself. The Pirate Party doesn’t revolve around me. I’m just one of many who are creating the group."&lt;ref name="toform"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fontaine|first1=Paul|title=MP To Form Pirate Party|url=http://grapevine.is/news/2012/07/18/mp-to-form-pirate-party/|accessdate=22 April 2016|work=The Reykjavik Grapevine|date=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was officially formed in November 2012, with Birgitta unanimously appointed as the first Chairman.&lt;ref name="reite"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reitemeyer|first1=Andrew|title=Iceland Has A Pirate Party|url=http://piratetimes.net/iceland-has-a-pirate-party/|accessdate=22 April 2016|work=Pirate Times|date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal battles===

In 2011, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] issued a [[subpoena]] to [[Twitter]] for all of Birgitta's Twitter information dating back to November 2009. In response, Birgitta petitioned a [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] in [[Virginia]] to force the Department of Justice to open its files on her to disclose the other internet providers that had also been ordered to submit her private data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/feb/11/icelandic-mp-wikileaks-us-birgitta-jonsdottir|title=Icelandic MP who released WikiLeaks video plans US visit despite legal threat|last=Pilkington|first=Ed|date=11 February 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the case, the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU) issued a resolution in support of Birgitta, including an expression of deep concern "at the efforts made by a State to obtain information about the communications of a member of parliament of another State and the likely consequences of this for members of parliament the world over on their ability to discharge their popular mandate freely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/hr-e/189/Is01.htm|title=Resolution adopted unanimously by the IPU Governing Council at its 189th session|last=|first=|date=19 October 2011|website=Inter-Parliamentary Union|publisher=|access-date=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, she was a plaintiff in the lawsuit ''[[Hedges v. Obama]]'', initiated against the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] (NDAA). The NDAA allowed the US government to detain indefinitely those "who are part of or substantially support [[Al Qaeda]], [[the Taliban]] or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States." Her fellow plaintiffs included [[Chris Hedges]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Daniel Ellsberg]], Jennifer Bolen, [[Alexa O'Brien]] and [[Cornel West]]. Her testament was read by [[Naomi Wolf]] in her place in March 2012.&lt;ref name="suing"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why I'm suing the US government to protect internet freedom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/18/suing-us-government-protect-internet-freedom|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=The Guardian|last=Jonsdottir|first=Birgitta|date=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the judgement of the court, Birgitta Jónsdóttir and fellow plaintiff {{Interlanguage link multi|Kai Wargalla|de}} presented separate evidence against the NDAA to the other plaintiffs, as neither were US citizens. During the judgement of the district court, according to the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]], the "district court found that both Birgitta and Wargalla had an actual fear of detention under Section 1021 and had incurred costs and other present injuries due to this fear."&lt;ref name="hedge1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hedges v. Obama|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1638947.html|website=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of the case was that a [[New York (state)|New York]] district court issued an injunction on the detention powers, but, in 2013, this was overturned by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]].

== Second parliamentary term, 2013–2016==
[[File:Birgitta Jónsdóttir 2015.jpg|thumb|Birgitta Jónsdóttir 2015]]
In the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 Icelandic parliamentary election]], Birgitta was elected as a Member of the Althing for [[Southwest Constituency]], this time representing the [[Pirate Party (Iceland)|Pirate Party]]. She continued as both an observer on the [[Foreign Affairs Committee (Iceland)|Foreign Affairs Committee]] and as a member of the EU-Iceland joint Parliamentary Committee, but also became a member of the Icelandic delegation to the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] (IPU) and of the [[Constitutional and Supervisory Committee (Iceland)|Constitutional and Supervisory Committee]], where she was also appointed as the 2nd Deputy Chairman.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In October 2013, a film was released about Wikileaks, called [[The Fifth Estate (film)|''The Fifth Estate'']]. In it, Birgitta was portrayed by Dutch actress [[Carice van Houten]]. During the production of the film, Birgitta advised the director and the scriptwriters, but later said that the "script is very inaccurate in many ways." During an interview with ''[[The New Republic]]'', she described how she asked for several scenes to be changed or removed because of their inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114845/interview-birgitta-jonsdottir-wikileaks-fifth-estate|title=The Woman Behind Wikileaks on What the Biopic Gets Wrong|last=Kinstler|first=Linda|date=25 September 2013|work=New Republic|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, she was criticised by Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson for her involvement with the film, and particularly for receiving payment for her consultancy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.visir.is/gagnrynir-birgittu-fyrir-ad-thiggja-laun-fra-dreamworks/article/2013131209156|title=Gagnrýnir Birgittu fyrir að þiggja laun frá DreamWorks|last=|first=|date=8 December 2013|work=Visir|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 to 2015, Birgitta served as the rotating chairman of the Pirate Party. Since April 2015, the Pirate Party has topped the polls in Iceland ahead of the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2017|2017 parliamentary election]]. Speaking to ''Quartz'', Birgitta said that "I'm very shocked and I don't know how long it will last. I think it's an expression of the lack of faith in the current, traditional parties in power. We are offering them alternative solutions."&lt;ref name="avast"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gottlieb|first1=Jenna|title=Avast, mateys: A band of pirates could oust Iceland’s conservative government|url=http://qz.com/602348/avast-mateys-a-band-of-pirates-could-oust-icelands-conservative-government/|accessdate=3 April 2016|work=Quartz|date=26 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, she announced that she would be standing for a third term, as, according to ''Iceland Review'', "she feels it’s important for the party to have someone on board experienced in working with the ministries and the inner political structure to ensure the effectiveness of the party."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icelandreview.com/news/2016/02/08/pirate-party-leader-run-again-2017|title=Pirate Party Leader to Run Again in 2017|last=Hafstad|first=Vala|date=8 February 2016|work=Iceland Review|access-date=29 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016, following calls for Prime Minister [[Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson]]'s resignation in the wake of the [[Panama Papers]] leak, Birgitta said that the Pirates were ready to form part of a new government in the event of a [[snap election]]. For about a year before April 2016, the Pirates were Iceland's most popular party, with varying support ranging from 36%-43% support from voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/panama-papers-icelands-pirate-party-ready-to-lead-a6967941.html|title=Panama Papers: Icelandic Pirate Party 'ready' to form part of government in event of snap election|last=Cowburn|first=Ashley|date=April 4, 2016|publisher=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/pirate-party-surges-ahead-as-iceland-calls-early-elections-and-names-new-pm|title=Pirate Party Surges as Iceland Calls Early Elections and Names New PM|date=April 7, 2016|publisher=[[VICE News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Third parliamentary term, 2016–2017==
In the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2016]] where the Pirate Party won 10 seats with 15% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2016/11/1/meet_birgitta_jonsdottir_the_ex_wikileaks Meet Birgitta Jónsdóttir: The Ex-WikiLeaks Volunteer Who Has Helped the Pirate Party Reshape Iceland] Democracy Now! 1 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run up to election Birgitta was accused of trying to manipulate the Pirate primary in the NV election district including by trying to slander the top list seat Þórðar Pétursson and asking other candidates to step down&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruv.is/frett/tveir-piratar-bera-birgittu-thungum-sokum&lt;/ref&gt; and pushing for the NV list to be invalided to get Gunnar Ingiberg Jónsson in the top seat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vb.is/frettir/lilja-gagnrynir-birgittu-vegna-profkjors/131029/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2016/09/09/birgitta_hafnar_asokunum/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Birgitta was married to Charles Egill Hirt (1964-1993), who went missing in June 1993, aged 29. His body was found five years after his disappearance. With Hirt, Birgitta had one son, Neptunus, born in 1991.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Birgitta married Australian Daniel Johnson in 2009.

'''Cancelli''' are [[lattice-work]], placed before a [[window]], a door-way, the [[tribunal]] of a [[judge]], or any other place.

Hence the occupation of '''Cancellarius''', which originally signified a [[Porter (carrier)|porter]] who stood at the latticed or grated door of the emperor's palace. [[Carinus]] gave great dissatisfaction by promoting one of these cancellarii to [[praefectus urbi|city prefect]].{{when?|date=February 2013}} Other cancellarii were legal scribes or secretaries who sat within the lattice-work which protected the tribunals of the judges from the crowd. The chief scribe in Constantinople eventually acquired the term and from his position came the modern "[[chancellor]]".

The '''canghellor''' of Medieval Wales was also a development of this position. He administered the peasantry of the king's [[demesne]] and was charged with holding the king's pleas and "waste".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wade-Evans, Arthur]]. ''[[s:Page:Welsh_Medieval_Law.djvu/431|Welsh Medieval Law]]''. Oxford Univ., 1909. Accessed 31 Jan 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine Breshkovsky''' (real name ''Yekaterina Konstantinovna Breshko-Breshkovskaya'' (born Verigo), {{lang-ru|Екатерина Константиновна Брешко-Брешковская}}; born January 25 (13&amp;nbsp;January old style) 1844, Ivanovo village, Nevelsky district, Vitebsk province – 12 September 1934 Hvaly-Pochernice, near Prague, Czechoslovakia. A major figure in the Russian socialist movement, a Narodnik and later one of the founders of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. She spent over four decades in prison and Siberian exile for peaceful opposition to Tsarism, acquiring, in her latter years, international stature as a political prisoner.  Also popularly known as '''[[wikt:бабушка|Babushka,]]''' the grandmother of the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/musings-from-the-gallows-autobiography-of-ram-prasad-bismil/oclc/180690320&amp;referer=brief_results |title=Musings from the gallows : autobiography of Ram Prasad Bismil |first=Malwinder Jit Singh |last=Waraich|page=90 |publisher=Unistar Books, [[Ludhiana]] |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
She left her home at the age of 26 to join followers of [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Mikhail Bakunin]] in [[Kiev]]. As a [[Narodnik]] extremist, she was imprisoned 1874 at [[Katorga]] and exiled to [[Siberia]] in 1878, where she received a harsher sentence because of her refusal to submit to the authority of the Tsarist court.&lt;ref name="Geyer (2012)"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.andreageyer.info/revolttheysaid/b.html|title=Revolt, They Said|website=www.andreageyer.info|access-date=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; during which she was interviewed by George Kennan, a journalist working for [[The Century Magazine|The ''Century ''magazine]], along with artist George A. Frost. Kennan was later quoted to say "All my standards of courage, of fortitude, and of heroic self-sacrifice have been raised for all time, and raised by the hand of a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Ian (2010). [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Travels-Siberia-Ian-Frazier/dp/0312610602 ''Travels in Siberia'']''. ''Picador – p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; After her release in 1896, she formed a Socialist-Revolutionary group and helped to organize the [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] in 1901.

She escaped to [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]] in 1900. After returning to the [[Russian Empire]] in 1905, she was captured and exiled to Siberia again. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, political prisoners were released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cheers Greet Return of Russia’s "Mother"|url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=LAH19170414.2.351|accessdate=October 31, 2016|issue=Latest News, Number 141|publisher=Los Angeles Herald|date=April 14, 1917|page=3|quote=When Madame Catherine Breshkovskaya, “Grandmother of the Revolution,” arrived here after spending 44 of her 73 years in exile, she was greeted by a big gathering of former followers of her revolutionist movement.

When the [[Bolshevik]]s organized the [[October Revolution]], Breshkovsky was again forced to flee to the United States and [[Japan]]. She then moved to [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1924 where she continued to fight the Bolshevik regime until her death.&lt;ref name="Geyer (2012)"/&gt;

Although her birth was registered as 'Cherie', owing to her maternal grandmother's influence she was christened 'Theresa Cara' in deference to the requirement that she be given a saint's name.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Cherie (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, British actor [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]], left her mother, actress Gale Howard (née Joyce Smith; 14 February 1933 – 5 June 2016), &lt;!-- Mother's real name also per memoir --&gt; when Cherie was 8 years old. Cherie and her younger sister Lyndsey were then brought up by Gale and their paternal grandmother Vera Booth, a devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] of Irish descent. The sisters attended Catholic schools in [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]], Merseyside. Cherie Booth attended [[Seafield Convent Grammar]], which is now part of [[Sacred Heart Catholic College]], where she achieved 4 Grade-A GCE [[Advanced Level (UK)|A Level]] passes.

She was a founding member of [[Matrix Chambers]] in London, from which she continues to practice as a barrister but is no longer a partner. Matrix was formed in 2000 specialising in [[human rights law]], though members also practice in a range of areas of UK [[Public law|public]] and [[private law]], the [[Law of the European Union]] and [[European Convention on Human Rights]], and [[public international law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/AreasOfPractice.aspx|title=Matrix Chambers|work=matrixlaw.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210002406/http://www.matrixlaw.co.uk/AreasOfPractice.aspx|archivedate=10 February 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is Founder and Chair of law firm Omnia Strategy LLP.&lt;ref name="OS profile"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Omnia Team » Cherie Blair CBE, QC|url=http://omniastrategy.com/15-2|website=omniastrategy.com|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150830102638/http://omniastrategy.com/15-2/|archivedate=30 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She specialises in [[Labour law|employment]], discrimination, and public law and, in this capacity, has occasionally represented claimants taking cases against the UK Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/445.html|title=Purja &amp; Ors, R (on the application of) v Ministry of Defence [2003&amp;#93; EWHC 445 (Admin) (21 February 2003) |publisher=Bailii.org|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, when sentencing a defendant, Shamso Miah, for assault, Booth announced that she would [[Suspended sentence|suspend his prison sentence]] after describing him as a "religious man". The court heard that Miah had been to a mosque shortly before he broke a man's jaw following a row in a bank queue. Blair told Miah: "You are a religious man and you know this is not acceptable behaviour." This was interpreted by some observers as special leniency given on account of the criminal's religiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8497365.stm|title=Complaint after Cherie Booth spares religious man jail|publisher=BBC News|date=4 February 2010|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Jerome|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/secular-society-upset-by-judge-cherie-decision-1889792.html|title=Secular society upset by Judge Cherie decision|work=The Independent|date=4 February 2010|accessdate=19 October 2013|location=London, UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214210142/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/secular-society-upset-by-judge-cherie-decision-1889792.html|archivedate=14 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Office for Judicial Complaints]] released an initial statement saying they had "received a number of complaints in relation to the comments" that Blair had made when sentencing Shamso Miah and that the matter was under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_0210.pdf|title=Statement from the office of judicial complaints|publisher=OJC|date=10 February 2010|accessdate=12 February 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 2010, the OJC released a statement saying that the investigation had "found that Recorder Booth's observations did not constitute judicial misconduct" and accordingly "no disciplinary action is necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judicialcomplaints.gov.uk/docs/Recorder_Cherie_Booth_QC_-_OJC_Investigation_Statement_-_1010.pdf|title=Investigation Statement – Recorder Cherie Booth QC|publisher=Office for Judicial Complaints|date=10 June 2010|accessdate=19 October 2013}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A private letter to the [[National Secular Society]] said, however, that the OJC had taken action in the form of "informal advice" from a more senior judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/10358121.stm|title=Cover-up claim over Cherie Blair court remark to Muslim|publisher=BBC News|date=19 June 2010|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Blair purchased two flats in [[Bristol]] with the assistance, it was alleged but later denied, of [[Peter Foster]], a convicted Australian [[Confidence trick|conman]] and boyfriend of Blair's friend [[Carole Caplin]], who negotiated a discount for Blair.&lt;ref name=BBCsorry&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2563649.stm "Cherie says 'sorry' for Foster dealings"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211203247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2563649.stm |date=11 February 2006 }}, BBC, 10 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Blair publicly apologised for her embarrassing connection to Foster,

In summer 2015, in the wake of the [[Hillary Clinton email controversy]], Blair was revealed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' to have lobbied Clinton in 2009 on behalf of prominent members of the Qatari monarchy; Clinton was US Secretary of State at the time.&lt;ref name="Cherie Qatar lobbyist"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Roberts|first=Dan|last2=Gibson|first2=Owen|date=1 July 2015|title=Hillary Clinton lobbied by Cherie Blair to meet Qatari royal, emails reveal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/hillary-clinton-lobbied-by-cherie-blair-qatari-royal-emails|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080043/http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/01/hillary-clinton-lobbied-by-cherie-blair-qatari-royal-emails|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/hillary-clinton/11837718/Hillary-Clinton-may-have-broken-US-secrecy-rules-with-emails-from-Tony-Blair-and-Downing-Street.html telegraph.co.uk: "Hillary Clinton may have broken US secrecy rules with emails from Tony Blair and Downing Street"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150902210258/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/hillary-clinton/11837718/Hillary-Clinton-may-have-broken-US-secrecy-rules-with-emails-from-Tony-Blair-and-Downing-Street.html |date=2 September 2015 }}, 1 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the newspaper, Blair denied this characterisation of her mediation efforts, describing their story as "sensationalist and inaccurate".&lt;ref name="Blair letter"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Blair|first=Cherie|date=3 July 2015|title=I did not lobby on behalf of Qatari royal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/03/cherie-blair-i-did-not-lobby-on-behalf-of-qatari-royal|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905232937/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/03/cherie-blair-i-did-not-lobby-on-behalf-of-qatari-royal|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precisely two months later, the release of another batch of Clinton's private emails confirmed that Blair had, indeed, arranged meetings with Clinton for the Qataris outside normal diplomatic channels, with discussions to involve "the US/Qatar relationship generally", not merely joint philanthropic efforts. In one case, Blair herself stated that her purpose was to help the eldest of [[Mozah bint Nasser Al Missned|Sheikha Mosah]]'s sons, [[Jasim bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]], "build up an international profile".&lt;ref name="Clinton lobbyist emails"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=1 September 2015|title=Hillary Clinton emails: Cherie Blair lobbied for Qatari crown prince|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/01/hillary-clinton-emails-cherie-blair-lobbied-qatari-royal-family|website=theguardian.com|accessdate=1 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905202124/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/sep/01/hillary-clinton-emails-cherie-blair-lobbied-qatari-royal-family|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2015, Blair's law firm accepted a large fee to advise the Maldives government as it faced a challenge from former Maldivian president [[Mohamed Nasheed]] over his imprisonment for "terrorism". Nasheed, who served during 2008–12 as his country's [[2011–12 Maldives political crisis|first democratically elected leader]], is seeing out a 13-year prison sentence after a widely criticised trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sherwell|first=Philip|date=9 September 2015|title=Amal Clooney v Cherie Blair: Maldives paradise islands stage battle of UK female lawyers|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/maldives/11854847/Clooney-v-Blair-Maldives-paradise-islands-stage-battle-of-UK-female-lawyers.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911205539/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/maldives/11854847/Clooney-v-Blair-Maldives-paradise-islands-stage-battle-of-UK-female-lawyers.html|archivedate=11 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Conduct of trial of Maldives' ex-President raises serious concerns|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15712|website=ohchr.org|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=21 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723025233/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15712|archivedate=23 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, while she was studying to become a barrister, she met future Prime Minister and husband [[Tony Blair]]. She obtained a [[pupillage]] in the chambers of [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] ahead of him, although he was also taken on. Married on 29 March 1980, the Blairs have three sons and one daughter: Euan (born 1984), Nicholas (born 1985), Kathryn (born 1988), and Leo (born 2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/10/blair.facts/index.html|title=Facts: Life and times of Tony Blair|publisher=Edition.cnn.com|accessdate=19 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020050012/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/10/blair.facts/index.html|archivedate=20 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/822238.stm|work=BBC News|title=Blair's son 'drunk and incapable'|date=6 July 2000|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307135804/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/822238.stm|archivedate=7 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3748947.stm|title=Blairs' family life under spotlight|date=2006|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215222125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3748947.stm|archivedate=15 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo was the first child born to the wife of a serving British Prime Minister in over 150 years, since Francis Russell was born to the wife of Lord John Russell on 11 July 1849. Another pregnancy at the age of 47 ended in miscarriage in early August 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2176872.stm|title=Cherie Blair suffers miscarriage|publisher=BBC News|date=6 August 2002|accessdate=19 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030124043911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2176872.stm|archivedate=24 January 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blair children attended Catholic secondary schools.

===Political and religious views===
Blair has described herself as a socialist and, at times, has appeared to have views further to the [[left-wing politics|left]] than those of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Martin |last=Kettle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/17/cherieblair.politicalbooks |title=Martin Kettle interviews Cherie Blair |work=The Guardian |date=17 May 2008 |accessdate=19 October 2013 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021151317/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/may/17/cherieblair.politicalbooks |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2008 she chaired the Street Weapons Commission on behalf of the broadcaster [[Channel 4]]. She toured the UK and took evidence from people affected by street crime and published a report and practical advice in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tara |last=Conlan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/26/channel4.television1 |title=Cherie Booth tackles street crime with Channel 4 |work=The Guardian |date=26 March 2008 |accessdate=19 October 2013 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021150015/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/26/channel4.television1 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a practising Roman Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2836183.ece |title=Faith |work=The Times |location=London |date= |accessdate=19 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008043510/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article2836183.ece |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Blair urged the Catholic Church to reconsider its hardline stance against [[contraception]], suggesting it could be holding some women back from pursuing a career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/blair-end-church-s-hard-line-on-birth-control-1.917502 |title=Blair: end Church's hard line on birth control |work=Herald Scotland |date=31 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522070846/http://www.heraldscotland.com/blair-end-church-s-hard-line-on-birth-control-1.917502 |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George W. Bush]]'s 2010 autobiography ''Decision Points'', Blair is briefly described as a fierce opponent of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bush|first=George W.|year=2010|title=Decision Points|location=New York, NY|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=978-0-307-59061-9|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=syAbvg2McVoC&amp;pg=PA231 231]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayals and coverage in books, film and theatre==
Blair wrote a book of her memoirs, published in late May 2008, entitled ''Speaking for Myself: The Autobiography'',&lt;ref name=CB2008-book&gt;Blair, Cherie (2008). Book cover&lt;/ref&gt; and the book was listed as a ''[[Sunday Times]]'' best-seller. Interviewed about the book by [[Carole MacNeil]] on the Canadian network [[CBC Television]] on 1 June 2008, Blair stated that she felt most of the controversy about her in the British media was due to her pioneering role as the first wife of a British Prime Minister who had her own career, with the media simply not knowing how to treat her fairly and objectively.&lt;ref&gt;''[[CBC Television]]'', 1 June 2008; interview by [[Carole MacNeil]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Played by [[Helen McCrory]], Blair features as a character in ''[[The Queen (2006 film)|The Queen]]'' (2006), starring [[Helen Mirren]], about the aftermath of the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997, and is portrayed as a fierce anti-monarchist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-queen-2006|title=The Queen Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2006) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=www.rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725004546/http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-queen-2006|archivedate=25 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCrory played her again in the 2010 [[HBO]] film ''[[The Special Relationship (film)|The Special Relationship]]''.

'''''Corsica Libera''''' ({{lang-en|Free Corsica}}) is a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[separatism|separatist]] political party active in [[Corsica]]. It was founded in [[Corte, Haute-Corse|Corte]] in February 2009 by members of three nationalist parties, ''[[Corsica Nazione]]'', ''Rinnovu'' and the Corsican Nationalist Alliance

''Corsica Libera'' advocates full independence for Corsica and it does not condemn the violent actions by groups such as the [[National Liberation Front of Corsica]]. The party distinguished itself with its symbolic occupation of [[Christian Clavier]]'s Corsican residence, 
The party has three seats in the [[Corsican Assembly]] and a number of local councillors, including the mayor of [[Granace]] (a little [[southern Corsica]]n village).

The party's candidate in the [[French regional elections, 2010#Corsica|2010 territorial elections]], Jean-Guy Talamoni, won 9.36% of the vote and qualified for the runoff. In the first round of the [[French regional elections, 2015|2015 French regional elections]], Corsica Libera got 7,73% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/regionales-2015/94/94.html Elections régionales et des assemblées de Corse, Guyane et Martinique 2015 - Résultats de la région au 1er et 2d tour]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were two near simultaneous '''bombings in Algiers'''  which occurred on 11 December 2007 when two [[car bomb]]s exploded 10 minutes apart starting at around 9:30 a.m. local time, in the [[Algeria]]n capital [[Algiers]].&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/12/11/algeria.html|title=11 UN workers among 26 killed in Algeria blasts|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]] has claimed responsibility for the attacks, stating that it was "another successful conquest […] carried out by the Knights of the Faith with their blood in defense of the wounded nation of Islam."&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Al Jazeera - Al Qaeda statement"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/4371B609-73CB-4AA2-8CC5-308B7C4092C7.htm |title=Al-Qaeda claims Algeria bombings |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2007-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401075350/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/4371B609-73CB-4AA2-8CC5-308B7C4092C7.htm |archivedate=2008-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks constitute another act of violence in the ongoing [[Islamic insurgency in Algeria (2002–present)|Islamic insurgency]], a continuation of the [[Algerian Civil War]] that has claimed 200,000 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=9739 |title=Algeria puts strife toll at 150,000 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=2005-02-25 |accessdate=2007-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214091507/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=9739 |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }} Note that the 150,000 figure was given on February 2005, and the Reuters article from June 2007 (below) includes an updated figure of 200,000 casualties.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL04297301|title=Algeria violence death toll at year low in May|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-06-04|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targets==
Two [[car bombs]] containing 800&amp;nbsp;kg (1,700&amp;nbsp;lb) of explosives each were used in the bombings.&lt;ref name="bbc_unreview"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7139787.stm|title=UN review after Algiers bombing |publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first explosion occurred in the Ben Aknoun district, near the Supreme Constitutional Court. This was followed ten minutes later by a second blast on the road that separates the [[United Nations]] offices from the offices of the [[UNHCR]] (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) in the Hydra neighborhood.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/475ebc454.html|title=UNHCR chief condemns Algiers bombing; mourns dead|publisher=[[UNHCR]]|date=2007-12-11|accessdate=2007-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Nations building partially collapsed in the explosion while the UNHCR offices were "leveled" according to a UNHCR official.&lt;ref name="CNN2" /&gt; The United Nations building housed the offices of the [[UNDP|UN Development Programme]] (UNDP), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[UN Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO), the [[UNAIDS|Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS), the Department of Safety and Security (DSS) and the [[UNFPA|Population Fund]] (UNFPA).&lt;ref name="AP1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gkGPT-k67MF4UR_s90Y_CNnZJkgQD8TFMKPO0 |title=UN in Grief at Algeria Bombings |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=2007-12-12 |accessdate=2007-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214163944/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gkGPT-k67MF4UR_s90Y_CNnZJkgQD8TFMKPO0 |archivedate=December 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapsed section mainly housed the UNDP.&lt;ref name="bbc_unreview" /&gt;

The attack against the UN office was a suicide bombing.&lt;ref name="bbc_unreview" /&gt; It is as yet unknown whether the same is true for the Constitutional Court attack.

The attack caused the third highest staff casualties in the history of the United Nations, after the 2003 [[Canal Hotel bombing]], which targeted the UN headquarters in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] and also killed the Secretary-General's Special Representative to Iraq [[Sérgio Vieira de Mello]] and 21 other staff members&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] in which 22 UN peacekeepers have been confirmed dead as of January 14, 2010; and 150 missing.  The [[Hédi Annabi|Head]] of [[MINUSTAH]] was killed in the disaster.

The bombings are believed to have killed at least 31 people.

Many people are still unaccounted for. A number of them are possibly still trapped under the rubble, according to UN spokeswoman Maria Okabe. Jean Fabre, head of the UN Development Programme's [[Geneva]] office, indicated they were still searching for survivors in the rubble.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

177 people were injured in total, according to Zerhouni.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;
[[CNN]] has confirmed that the bombers used homemade [[nitroglycerin]] bombs, which had iron nails in them to increase casualties.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council]] held an official meeting on the same day in order to condemn the attacks.&lt;ref name="UN_SPV5798_2007"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5798 |date=11 December 2007 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=5798 |accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Disability}}
'''Disability Living Allowance''' ('''DLA''') is a [[social security]] benefit in the [[United Kingdom]] paid to eligible claimants who have personal care and/or mobility needs as a result of a mental or physical disability. It is tax-free, non-[[means test|means-tested]] and non-contributory. The benefit was introduced in 1992, integrating the former benefits [[Mobility Allowance]] and [[Attendance Allowance]] and introducing two additional lower rates of benefit. Prior to 2013 it could be claimed by UK residents aged under sixty five years. However, the benefit was phased-out for the majority of claimants between 2013 and 2015 and replaced by a new [[Personal Independence Payment]]. DLA can still be claimed by children under sixteen and can still be received by existing claimants who were aged sixty five or over on 8 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=2010 to 2015 government policy: welfare reform (policy paper)|section=Appendix 6: introducing Personal Independence Payment|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/2010-to-2015-government-policy-welfare-reform/2010-to-2015-government-policy-welfare-reform#appendix-6-introducing-personal-independence-payment|publisher=Department for Work and Pensions|date=8 May 2015|accessdate=15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The assessment system fails a sizable minority” of long-term disability benefit claimants.  The assessment is too frequently subject to basic errors, insensitivity and ignorance about people’s disabilities, MPs stated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/09/disability-claimants-substantial-minority-failed-by-assessment-system-mps-committee 'Substantial minority' of disability claimants failed by system – MPs] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==

DLA is restricted to people who fall into all of the following categories:

* They must ordinarily be resident and present in the UK
* They must meet the rules concerning age: new DLA claims can only be made if the claimant is under 16; however existing claimants can continue to claim DLA if they were born on or before 8 April 1948.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit/eligibility&lt;/ref&gt;
* They must not be living in certain types of residential accommodation
* They must have had a disability for at least three months, and expect it to continue for at least six more months
* They must have care and/or mobility needs.
Usually, to qualify for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for children the child must:
* Be under sixteen
* Need extra looking after or have walking difficulties
* Be in Great Britain, another European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland when you claim - there are some exceptions, e.g. family members of the Armed Forces
* Be habitually resident in the UK, Ireland, Isle of Man or the Channel Islands
* Not be subject to immigration control
* Have lived in Great Britain for two of the last three years, if over 3 years old
Children under the age of three.
* A child under six months must have lived in Great Britain for at least thirteen weeks.
* A child aged between six months and three years must have lived in Great Britain for at least twenty six of the last 156 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/disability-living-allowance-children/eligibility|title=Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for children - GOV.UK|work=[[Government of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=29 January 2016}} This website is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals can qualify for DLA whether or not they are working. Earnings do not affect the amount of DLA received.  People who are terminally ill typically qualify for the highest rate of Care component of DLA under what is termed "special rules".

==Care component==
DLA care component is paid at one of three rates: lowest, middle and highest.  From April 2018 the rates were:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Care component
! Weekly rate
|-
| Highest rate
| £85.60
|-
| Middle rate
| £57.30
|-
| Lowest rate
| £22.65
|}

===Lowest rate eligibility===
Individuals are entitled to the lowest rate care component if they are so severely disabled that they:
* require another person to give them attention in connection with their bodily functions for a significant portion of the day during a single period or a number of periods; or
* cannot prepare a cooked main meal for themselves provided they have all the ingredients and are aged 16 or over.

===Middle rate eligibility===
Individuals are entitled to the middle rate care component if they are so severely disabled that they: 
* require another person to give them frequent attention throughout the day in connection with their bodily functions; or
* require prolonged or repeated attention during the night in connection with their bodily functions; or
* require continual supervision throughout the day in order to avoid substantial danger to themselves or others; or
* require another person to be awake for a prolonged period or at frequent intervals at night, for the purpose of watching over them in order to avoid substantial danger to themselves or others.

===Highest rate eligibility===
Individuals are entitled to the highest rate care component if they meet one of the day conditions ''and'' one of the night conditions for the middle rate care component.

==Mobility component==
DLA mobility component is paid at one of two rates: lower and higher.  From April 2018 the rates were:

{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! Mobility component
! Weekly rate
|-
| Higher rate
| £59.75
|-
| Lower rate
| £22.65
|}

===Lower rate eligibility===
Individuals are entitled to the lower rate mobility component if they are so severely mentally or physically disabled that they cannot walk outdoors on an unfamiliar route without guidance or supervision from another person most of the time.

===Higher rate eligibility===
Individuals are entitled to the higher rate mobility component if they:- 
* are physically disabled and as a result are unable, or virtually unable, to walk; or
* are physically disabled and the exertion required to walk would endanger their life or health; or
* have had both legs amputated at or above the ankle, or were born without legs or feet; or are blind and deaf and need someone with them outdoors.
* are severely mentally impaired and have severe behavioural problems and receive the highest rate care component.

Mobility allowances (usually using the [[Motability]] scheme) are structured to provide persons with disabilities with mechanical aids to their mobility, which may include wheelchairs, scooters, or automobiles.

'''Eyes only''' is [[jargon]] used with regard to [[classified information]]. Whereas a classified document is normally intended to be available to anyone with the appropriate security clearance, an "eyes only" designation, whether official or informal, indicates that the document is intended only for a specific set of readers. As such the document should not be read by other individuals even if they otherwise possess the appropriate clearance. Another meaning is that the document is under no circumstances to be copied or photographed, "eyes only" meaning that it is to be physically read by cleared personnel and nothing more, to ensure that no unauthorized copies of the text are made which might be unaccounted for.

EYES ONLY may be used as part of the [[national caveats]] in English speaking countries performing as an addition to the security classification. The caveat designates assets of particular sensitivity to, say, the UK, or where dissemination is restricted to individuals from specific foreign nations. Unless explicitly named, information bearing a national caveat will not be sent to foreign governments, overseas contractors, international organisations or released to any foreign nationals.

British regulations require notices on the document to specify a level of [[security classification|classification]] ("[[Top secret|TOP SECRET]]", e.g.) and a "caveat", separated by a hyphen, e.g.,
:TOP SECRET – UK / US EYES ONLY
and centered horizontally on the page.&lt;ref name=Gov_Sec_Clas&gt;{{cite book|title=Government Security Classifications May 2018|date=May 2018|publisher=(UK) Cabinet Office|page=12|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/715778/May-2018_Government-Security-Classifications-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9105">Alleged '''Financial irregularities during the Manuel Zelaya administration''' received attention of many Hondurans.
In late 2008, [[Manuel Zelaya|Zelaya]] went as far as refusing to send Congress a budget, claiming that it was impossible to come up with numbers, even though the constitution required the president to provide budget. The alleged irregularities are currently being investigated by the post coup government.

==Early presidency==

At least 20 alleged corruption scandals came to light during his first year. By February 2007, his administration had prosecuted four cases, and three had been dismissed while the others were still being investigated.&lt;ref name="ips-corruption"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36682 |title=CORRUPTION-HONDURAS: A Murky Transparency Law |date=2007-02-23 |publisher=Interpress Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226010842/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36682 |archivedate=2010-12-26 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early instances of alleged financial irregularities in the administration was a contract to resurface 94 miles of road from Tegucigalpa to Danli. The company was paid the full price of the contract, but it resurfaced only 50 kilometers.&lt;ref name="corruption"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Apertura/Ediciones/2009/06/28/Noticias/Corrupcion-una-constante-en-la-administracion-zelaya |title=Corrupción: una constante en la administración zelaya |publisher=La Prensa |date=2009-06-28 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lu8Y8quv?url=http://www.laprensahn.com/Apertura/Ediciones/2009/06/28/Noticias/Corrupcion-una-constante-en-la-administracion-zelaya |archivedate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zelaya spent millions of dollars on consulting and professional costs without documentation.
A joint investigation by auditors in Honduras has so far identified alleged squandering of presidential expenses amounting to 123,025,613.63 lempiras.&lt;ref name="presidentialexpenses"&gt;[http://www.laprensahn.com/Internacionales/Ediciones/2009/09/06/Noticias/Investigan-120-casos-de-corrupcion-en-Presidencial Investigan 120 casos de corrupción en Presidencial]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2009/09/06/Noticias/Investigaran-otros-120-escandalos-en-Presidencial |title=Investigarán otros 120 escándalos en Presidencial |publisher=El Heraldo |date=2009-09-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lu9AGHb1?url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/Ediciones/2009/09/06/Noticias/Investigaran-otros-120-escandalos-en-Presidencial |archivedate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hondurannews.com/article/publish/casa_de_gobierno/More_than_50_corruption_cases_forwarded_to_Presidential_MP.shtml |title=More than 50 corruption cases forwarded to Presidential MP |publisher=Honduran News |date=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ajs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://asjhonduras.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92:manuel-zelaya-idefensor-de-los-pobres |title=Manuel Zelaya ¿Defensor de los pobres? |publisher=ASJ Honduras |date=2009-10-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lu8wtpUO?url=http://asjhonduras.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=92%3Amanuel-zelaya-idefensor-de-los-pobres |archivedate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }} ([http://www.ajshonduras.org/Zelaya_defender_of_the_poor.htm English version])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corruption at Hondutel===
{{Main|Hondutel}}

[[Hondutel]] was the best-documented case of embezzlement. Manuel Zelaya's nephew [[Marcelo Chimirri]] is one of the suspects. The investigations were helped by evidence retrieved by the [[FBI]]. After the scandal was published in Honduran media, Chimirri sued the journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ifex.org/honduras/2007/10/05/court_declares_inadmissible_lawsuit/ |title=Court declares inadmissible lawsuit against five journalists for "damage to reputation" | publisher=Reporters Without Borders}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renato Alvarez]] was sentenced to 2 years and 8 months in prison.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

===2008 Allegations===
Zelaya allegedly earmarked 5.4 million lempiras on mobilizing supporters of the country's accession to the [[Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas]] (ALBA), an organization founded by [[Hugo Chávez]]. The pro-ALBA "demonstration" took place on August 25, 2008. The beneficiaries included 38 individuals, union leaders, unions, and owners transport companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/29980 |title=TSC y Fiscalía investigan despilfarro de 5.4 millones |publisher=El Heraldo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[constitution of Honduras]] requires that the President files the budget by September 15. Zelaya refused. He claimed that it was impossible to come up with numbers.&lt;ref name="wsjbehindmutiny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124847775316780293 |title=Behind the Honduran Mutiny |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=2009-07-25 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5luAn0H8h?url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124847775316780293.html |archivedate=2009-12-10 |first=Jose |last=De Cordoba |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="poder3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.poder360.com/article_detail.php?id_article=2690&amp;pag=3 |title=Crisis in Honduras What was really behind the removal of President Manuel Zelaya, and is he likely to be reinstated? |publisher=Poder |date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julio Raudales, Zelaya’s former deputy minister, said the budgetary black hole cost the country some $400 million in funding.&lt;ref name="poder3"/&gt; [[Óscar Andrés Rodríguez Maradiaga|Cardinal Rodríguez]] criticized Zelaya for using public money to promote his plans instead of spending it on the poor. He said "We were good friends. But he changed drastically... It was Chávez."&lt;ref name="poder3"/&gt;

On September 30, 2008 Zelaya issued emergency executive decree 46-A-2208, which authorized transfer of 30 million lempiras of public money to advertising of his fourth ballot box. Soon after he issued another emergency executive decree which is identical except that the money is transferred to his office.
Auditors later found documentation of 29 checks and total 29,995,887.62 lempiras. The expenses weren't well documented.The supposed advertisers paid no sales tax.

===2009 Allegations===
On May 30, 2009, auditors found that Zelaya had directly spent more than 2 billion lempiras without competitive bidding.&lt;ref name="zelayabidding"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/138934 |title=2,113 millones erogó el gobierno en compras directas sin licitación |publisher=El Heraldo |date=2009-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, [[Enrique Flores Lanza]], Zelaya's chief of staff, withdrew millions of dollars from the [[Central Bank of Honduras]]. The money was taken "to help the Ministry of the Presidency" and transported by car to Lanza's office. The suspected theft was captured by surveillance cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jul/22/zelaya-accused-of-cash-withdrawal/|title=EXCLUSIVE: Ousted Honduran leader accused of theft|publisher=The Washington Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profile of activities ==
The Global Centre for Pluralism draws on Canada’s successful record in constructing and sustaining pluralist [[civil society]]. Working closely with governments, academia and civil society around the world, the Centre is a think-tank for studying and fostering pluralism.&lt;ref name="OttawaCitizen20061027"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/ontario/story.html?id=d6064d7f-68d2-47d1-91e8-b723aea08af3&amp;k=37878 |title=Muslim leader plays down 'clash of civilizations' |last=Zabjek |first=Alexandra |publisher=CanWest News Service |work=The Ottawa Citizen |date=2006-10-27 |accessdate=2007-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024212632/http://www.canada.com/globaltv/ontario/story.html?id=d6064d7f-68d2-47d1-91e8-b723aea08af3&amp;k=37878 |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to foster legislation and policy that strengthens developing countries’ capacity for enhancing pluralism in law, justice, the arts, the media, financial services, health and education. In addition, it will deliver programs, facilitate dialogue, develop pedagogical materials and work with partners worldwide to build capacity to promote indigenous approaches to pluralism within countries and communities.&lt;ref name="PRAKDN20050418"/&gt;

From its inception, the Centre is expected to be one of the largest think-tanks in Canada.&lt;ref name="OttawaCitizen20040521"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ismaili.net/timeline/2004/20040521oc.html |title=Aga Khan announces think-tank for Ottawa | date=2004-05-21 | publisher=The Ottawa Citizen |last=Singer |first=Zev |accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is consistent with Canadian international policy objectives, including the promotion of democracy and good governance, a more equitable sharing of the world’s resources between developed and developing countries, and the projection of Canadian values, such as the rule of law, human rights and respect for diversity.&lt;ref name="PRAKDN20050418"/&gt;

The Centre honours people, for efforts to build an inclusive society, with the Global Pluralism Awards.

'''Hands Off the People of Iran''' (HOPI) is a political organisation in the [[United Kingdom]] founded in 2007, closely associated with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)]]. It is opposed to [[Opposition to military action against Iran|Western military intervention in Iran]], as well as to the sitting Iranian government, and supports "internal" regime change.

Mike Macnair, the Israeli [[Moshé Machover]] and [[Yassamine Mather]], an Iranian associated with the [[Workers Left Unity – Iran]]. It was denied affiliation with the [[Stop the War Coalition]] due to questions raised over its support for regime change.

==Formation==

The initiative for Hands Off the People of Iran came from a number of Iranian exile organisations in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopoi.org/whoweare.html Who we are]&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 2006, [[Workers Left Unity - Iran]] wrote an open letter to the British [[anti-war movement]], calling for genuine solidarity with the Iranian people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpgb.org.uk/worker/616/iran%20workers%20unity.htm Open letter to the anti war movement]&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 HOPI was fully established, consisting predominantly of Iranian exiles who campaign for regime change in Iran but are against external military intervention, believing [[military occupation]] to be the worst condition under which liberation can be achieved.  HOPI's founding conference was held in December 2007.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

At the Founding Conference, a National Steering Committee was established consisting of seventeen members from a range of different political organisations and political traditions. These include members of the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], [[British Labour Party#Labour Representation Committee|Labour Representation Committee]], [[Jewish Socialist Group]], [[Permanent Revolution Tendency|Permanent Revolution]], [[Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements]] at the [[University of Glasgow]], [[Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee)]], [[Workers Left Unity - Iran]], Revolutionary Workers of Iran, [[Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)|Anarchist Federation]] (pc) and Women’s Campaign Against All Misogynist Laws in Iran.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

An Irish branch of HOPI, chaired by Anne McShane, organised a protest outside the Iranian Embassy in Dublin in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0618/breaking22.htm|title=Iranians set for protest in Dublin|last=MAC CORMAIC|first=RUADHÁN|work=Irish Times|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/ireland/dublin-march-for-political-change-in-iran-416527.html|title=Dublin march for political change in Iran|date=27 June 2009|work=Ireland Online|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/jun/28/hundreds-attend-iran-support-rally/|title=Hundreds attend Iran support rally|date=28 June 2009|work=Sunday Tribune|accessdate=2009-07-07}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expulsion from Stop the War Coalition==

Shortly before [[STWC|Stop the War Coalition]]'s 2007 AGM, HOPI, alongside another organisation [[Communist Students (Autonomous)|Communist Students]], was denied affiliation with the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/antiwar-activists-do-battle-over-intervention-in-iran-399450.html|title=Anti-war activists do battle over intervention in Iran|last=Taylor|first=Jerome|date=8 November 2007|work=The Independent|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliates and Supporters==
Prominent affiliates or supporters of HOPI include the [[Public and Commercial Services Union]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/record_of_decisions/2008/affiliations.cfm|title=Affiliations|year=2008|work=Public and Commercial Services Union|accessdate=2009-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127220307/http://pcs.org.uk/en/news_and_events/record_of_decisions/2008/affiliations.cfm|archivedate=2010-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASLEF]], the train drivers' union and [[Peter Tatchell]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/iransantiarabracism|title=Iran's anti-Arab racism|last=Tatchell|first=Peter|date=26 October 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nauru]] is a small island country in the South Pacific. With a population of 9,322 it is the world's least populous independent republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html CIA World Factbook: Nauru]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6RVPUjQKr?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html |date=1 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nauru's government operates under its constitution, part two of which contains 'protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.' The Human Rights Council ([[UNHRC]]) carried out Nauru's Universal Periodic Review ([[Universal Periodic Review|UPR]]) in January 2011. The review was generally favourable with only a few areas of concern.

==Human rights treaties==
Nauru became a member of the United Nations on 14 September 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/members/ Member States of the United Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the nine core human rights treaties [[Nauru]] has ratified or acceded to four of them- the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ([[UNCRC]]) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]), the Convention Against Torture ([[United Nations Convention Against Torture|CAT]]),and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ([[CRPD]]). The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ([[ICCPR]]) along with the First Optional Protocol were both signed on 12 November 2001 but are yet to be ratified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.int/nauru/treaties.html International/Regional Agreements, Conventions and Treaties: Nauru]&lt;/ref&gt; Nauru stated that the burden of reporting, specifically the financial cost, was a significant factor behind their low rate of participation in [[international human rights instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/nauru/session_10_-_january_2011/ahrc173naurue.pdf Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Nauru, para 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Australia's use of the [[Nauru Detention Centre]] for housing asylum seekers, and in response to many recommendations from other states and human rights monitoring bodies, in June 2011, Nauru ratified the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barc.org.au/post/12735 Brisbane Action Web: 'Nauru Signs Refugee Convention']&lt;/ref&gt; Nauru also acceded to the [[Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture|OPCAT]] on 24 January 2013.

==Women's rights==
Domestic violence is a systemic problem in Nauru and was referred to frequently throughout the UPR report. In response Nauru accepted recommendations to ratify CEDAW and drew attention to several already existing measures. The elimination of domestic violence has been a national priority since 2002 when the government created the Women's Affairs Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0911/S00649.htm Scoop Pacific: 'Statement of Nauru Parliamentarian on VAW']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Nauruan Police Force received funding to establish a Domestic Violence Unit and safe-house for victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acwap.com.au/journal/issue26.pdf Lydia Bezeruk, ‘Nauru Police Response to Domestic Violence’ (2010) The Journal of Women and Policing 40.]&lt;/ref&gt; International Women's Day is a national holiday. The Nauru ''Crimes Act 2016'', makes domestic violence and revenge pornography a criminal offence since May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nauru-news.com/#!Nauru-Government-updates-Criminal-Code/cjds/57450aab0cf22b6a7596d9a4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==LGBT rights==
{{Main|LGBT rights in Nauru}}
The May 2016 passage of the ''Crimes Act 2016'' replaced the ''Nauruan Criminal Code 1899'', removed any criminal penalties for sexual activity between consenting adults of the same sex in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nauru Government updates Criminal Code|url=http://www.nauru-news.com/#!Nauru-Government-updates-Criminal-Code/cjds/57450aab0cf22b6a7596d9a4|website=Nauru Media and Public Information|publisher=Government of the Republic of Nauru|accessdate=20 June 2016|date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms==

===Proposed constitutional amendments===
{{main article|Nauruan constitutional referendum, 2010}}

In 2009 the Nauruan Parliament passed a bill to amend part II of the Constitution. The amendment proposed extending the protection of the rights of disabled persons, the environment and children as well as recognising the right to receive healthcare, education and maternity leave in the Constitution. The amendment failed to gain the required two-thirds approval in a referendum held on 27 February 2010. The Constitutional Review Committee, a Standing Committee of Parliament, aims to explore alternative formats for a subsequent referendum.

===Crimes Act 2016===
In May 2016, Nauru has implemented a new ''Crimes Act 2016'', that modernised the criminal justice system of Nauru and bring it in line with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nauru-news.com/#!Nauru-Government-updates-Criminal-Code/cjds/57450aab0cf22b6a7596d9a4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==National human rights institution==
Nauru has no national human rights institution. However, in November 2009 Nauru invited a delegation to visit the country and advise the government on the potential establishment of a national human rights mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiapacificforum.net/news/nauru-to-consider-options-for-human-rights-body.html Asia Pacific Forum: 'Nauru to Consider Options for Human Rights Body']&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates included representatives from the Asia Pacific Forum and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Several states noted in the UPR that since the delegation Nauru had not taken further steps to establish a human rights institution and recommended that this be addressed. Nauru accepted these recommendations but cited resources and expertise as their 'biggest obstacles' in pursuit of this goal and stated that the funding of other institutions took precedence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/nauru/session_10_-_january_2011/ahrc173naurue.pdf Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Nauru, para 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous land rights''' are the [[rights]] of [[indigenous peoples]] to [[land law|land]], either [[individual and collective rights|individually or collectively]]. Land and resource-related rights are of fundamental importance to indigenous peoples for a range of reasons, including: the [[religious]] significance of the land, [[self-determination]], identity, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bouma|title=Religious Diversity in Southeast Asia and the Pacific: National Case Studies|year=2010|publisher=Springer|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land is a major [[economic]] asset. The majority of [[indigenous peoples]] living in forest areas depend on the natural resources of their lands to fulfill their subsistence needs. [[Hunting]], [[fishing]], [[Hunter-gatherer|gathering]] of forest products, and small garden plots still form the basis of their household economy. The security and permanence of their control and use of the natural resource base is actually more important to most indigenous groups than direct [[ownership]] of the land itself.{{citation needed|reason= Conjecture|date=November 2015}} The demand for ownership, in fact, derives from the need to ensure their access to these resources, so it is of particular importance to examine how the different national-level legal regimes handle this aspect of indigenous ownership. Land is also an important instrument of [[inheritance]] and it is a symbol of social status. The land is essential for people’s [[spirituality|spiritual]] development. The land is sacred and everything they get from the land is a gift from their gods. Losing their land means a loss of contact with the earth and a loss of identity. Land is not only an asset with economic and financial value, but also a very important part of people's lives, worldviews and belief systems.

Indigenous [[land claim]]s have been addressed, with varying degrees of success on the national and international level, since [[colonization]]. Such claims may be based upon the principles of [[international law]], [[treaty|treaties]], [[common law]], or domestic [[constitution]]s or [[legislation]]. Statutory recognition and protection of indigenous and community land rights continues to be a major challenge, with the gap between formally recognized and customarily held and managed land is a significant source of underdevelopment, conflict, and [[environmental degradation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://landportal.info/book/thematic/indigenous-community-land-rights|website=Land Portal|title=Indigenous &amp; Community Land Rights|publisher=Land Portal Foundation|accessdate=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
Indigenous land rights have historically been undermined by a variety of doctrines such as ''[[terra nullius]]''.

The foundational documents for indigenous land rights in [[international law]] include [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989]] ("[[International Labour Organization|ILO 169]]"), the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[American Convention on Human Rights]].

==Common law==
{{main|Aboriginal title}}
[[Aboriginal title]] is the [[common law]] doctrine that the land rights of [[indigenous peoples]] to [[customary land|customary tenure]] persist after the assumption of [[sovereignty]]. Indigenous peoples may also have certain rights on [[Crown land]] in many jurisdictions.

===Australia===

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:The 1982 Commonwealth Game Protest.jpg|thumb|right|A demonstration for Aboriginal land rights, marches through [[Brisbane]] during the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]]]] --&gt;

===Canada===
{{main|Aboriginal title in Canada}}
The leading case for aboriginal title in [[Canada]] is ''[[Delgamuukw v. British Columbia]]'' (1997).

===New Zealand===
{{main|Aboriginal title in New Zealand|Māori protest movement}}
Indigenous land rights were recognised in the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] made between the [[British Crown]] and various [[Māori people|Māori]] chiefs. The Treaty itself has often been ignored, but New Zealand courts have usually accepted the existence of native title. Controversies over indigenous land rights have tended to revolve around the means by which Māori lost ownership, rather than whether they had ownership in the first place.

===United States===
{{main|Aboriginal title in the United States}}
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="Next to shooting indigenous peoples, the surest way to kill us is to separate us from our part of the Earth."|source=Hayden Burgess, Hawaii&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=We are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples |last=Eede |first=Joanna |publisher=Quadrille Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=1-84400-729-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The foundational decision for aboriginal title in the United States is ''[[Johnson v. McIntosh]]'' (1823), authored by Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].

[[Native Americans in the United States]] have largely been relegated to [[Indian reservation]]s managed by tribes under the [[United States Department of the Interior]]'s [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].

=== Latin America ===
As the political systems of some [[Latin American]] countries are now becoming more democratic and open to listening and embracing the views of minorities these issues of [[land rights]] have clearly come up to the surface of the political life. Despite this new “re-recognition” bit by bit, the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups are still among the poorest populations of the countries and they often have less access to resources and they have lesser opportunities for progress and development.
The legal situation of indigenous land rights in the countries of Latin America is highly varied. There is still a very broad variation of indigenous rights, laws and recognition throughout the whole continent. In the year 1957, the [[International Labour Organization]](ILO), made the ILO Convention 107. This [[Treaty|convention]] created laws and norms for the protection and integration of indigenous peoples in independent countries. All the independent countries of Latin America and the [[Caribbean]] of that time ratified this convention. Since the 1960s they started with the recognition of the first indigenous land claims since the colonial era. In the year 1989 the ILO made the [[Convention 169]]; the convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, which updates the ILO 107 of 1957. In this convention was also the recognition of the very close and important relationship between land and identity, or cultural identity very important. Today this convention has been ratified by 15 Latin American and Caribbean countries.

==Civil law==

===Brazil===
{{main|Indigenous territory (Brazil)}}

===Mexico===
The years after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910 saw agrarian reforms (1917–1934), and in ''article 27'' of the [[Mexican Constitution]] the [[encomienda system]] was abolished, and the right to [[communal land]] for traditional communities was affirmed. Thus the [[ejido]]-system was created, which in practice should comprise the power of private investments by foreign corporations and [[absentee landlords]], and entitled the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] population to a piece of land to work and live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Since the 1980s and 1990s the focus of Mexico's economic policy concentrated more on industrial development and attracting foreign capital. The [[Salinas government]] initiated a process of privatization of land (through the PROCEDE-program). In 1992, as a (pre)condition for Mexico for entering the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) with the US and Canada, art.4 and art.27 of the [[Mexican Constitution|Constitution]] were modified, by means of which it became possible to privatize communal ejido-land. This undermined the basic security of indigenous communities to land entitlement, and former ''ejidatorios'' now became formally ''illegal land-squatters'', and their communities [[informal settlements]]. (see also the [[Chiapas conflict]])

'''Jack Herer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛr|ər}}; June 18, 1939 – April 15, 2010), sometimes called the "Emperor of Hemp", was an American [[cannabis rights]] activist and the author of ''[[The Emperor Wears No Clothes]]'', a book—in 2016 in its twelfth edition after having been continuously in print for 31 years—frequently cited in efforts to [[Legality of cannabis|decriminalize and legalize cannabis]] and to expand the use of [[hemp]] for industrial use. Herer also founded and served as the director of the organization Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/culture/characters/herer_jack/herer_jack.shtml|title=Erowid Jack Herer Vault|work=erowid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Jack Herer Cup is held in Las Vegas each year to honor Jack Herer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackherercup.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
An early glass pipe entrepreneur, opening his first head shop in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Selling Of Drug Paraphernalia Goes From Chic To Underground '''http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-09-05/news/8901100384_1_pipes-paraphernalia-head-shops'''&lt;/ref&gt; Herer was a pro-cannabis and hemp activist. There was a documentary made about his life called, "Emperor of Hemp," which was aired on PBS stations throughout the U.S. and was translated into French and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snagfilms.com/films/title/emperor_of_hemp_the_jack_herer_story|title=Watch "Emperor of Hemp" Full Documentary Online Free - Snagfilms|author=Snagfilms|work=Snagfilms}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
As an activist he taught that the [[cannabis]] plant should be decriminalized and argued that it could be used as a renewable source of fuel, medicine, food, fiber and paper/pulp and that it can be grown in virtually any part of the world for [[medical cannabis|medicinal]] as well as economical purposes. He further asserted that the U.S. government has been deliberately hiding the proof of this from their own citizens.

A former [[Goldwater Republican]], Herer ran for United States President twice, in [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] (1,949 votes) and [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]] (3,875 votes) as the [[Grassroots Party]] candidate.

==Health problems==
[[File:Hempstalk2009-jack-herer.jpg|thumb|Herer speaking at the 2009 Hempstalk Festival, moments before his second heart attack]]
In July 2000, Herer suffered a minor heart attack and a major stroke, resulting in difficulties speaking and moving the right side of his body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/1620.html "Jack Herer suffers heart attack"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224848/http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/1620.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}, Pete Brady, Cannabis Culture Magazine, July 20, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Herer mostly recovered, and claimed in May 2004 that treatment with the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'', a [[Mushroom#Psychoactive mushrooms|psychoactive mushroom]], was the "secret".&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepress.org/journal.php?strFunc=display&amp;strID=229&amp;strJournal=27 "An Afternoon With Jack Herer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930155230/http://freepress.org/journal.php?strFunc=display&amp;strID=229&amp;strJournal=27 |date=September 30, 2007 }}, Sean Luse, The Free Press, May 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2009, Herer suffered another heart attack while backstage at the [[Portland Hempstalk Festival|Hempstalk Festival]] in [[Portland, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/emperor-wears-no-clothes-marijuana-author-jack-herer-collapses-after-stage-appearance-portla|title="The Emperor Wears No Clothes" Marijuana Author Jack Herer Collapses After Stage Appearance at Portland Hempstalk|work=Cannabis Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was discharged to another facility on October 13, 2009. Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation said "He is waking up and gazing appropriately when someone is talking... but he is not really communicating in any way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salem-news.com/articles/october132009/jackherer_101309.php "Jack Herer Strives To Recover As The Fight For Hemp Goes On"], Bonnie King, Salem-news.com , October 13, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On April 15, 2010, he died in [[Eugene, Oregon]] from complications related to the September 2009 heart attack. He was 70 years old at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salem-news.com/articles/april152010/jack_herer_died.php "The Hemperor, Jack Herer has Died"], Bonnie King, Salem-news.com , April 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2010/04/jack_herer_fatherof_marijuana.html|title=Jack Herer, father of marijuana legalization movement, dies at age 70 in Eugene |last=Saker|first=Anne|date=2010-04-15|work=[[The Oregonian]]|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herer was buried at the [[Eden Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Mission Hills, California]].

==Criticism==
European experts on hemp, like Dr. Hayo M.G. van der Werf, author of the doctoral thesis ''Crop physiology of fibre hemp'' (1994), and Dr. Ivan Bûcsa criticized Herer for making unrealistic claims regarding the potential of hemp, compare [[L.H.Dewey]](1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/fiberproductioni518dewe#page/66/mode/2up|author=Dewey LH|title=Fiber production in the western hemisphere|date=1943|page=67|publisher=United States Printing Office, Washington|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Herer claimed that hemp produces higher yields than other crops. Van der Werf argued that is simply wrong. Under most favorable growing conditions, other crops such as maize, [[sugar beet]] or potato produced similar dry matter yields. Fiber hemp is in no way exceptional in terms of weight yield.&lt;ref name="Werf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01213.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130713184209/http://www.hempfood.com/iha/iha01213.html |archivedate=July 13, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Herer claimed that [[hemp hurds]], which make up 60 to 80% of the stem dry weight, contain 77% cellulose. Van der Werf argued that is wrong. Cellulose content of hemp hurds has been found to vary between 32 and 38% (Bedetti and Ciaralli 1976, van der Werf 1994). Possibly, Herer confused the hurds, which form the woody core of the hemp stem, with the bark, which forms the outer layer of the hemp stem. The bark contains the long bast fibers which are used in textile manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Werf"/&gt;
* Herer claimed that millions of tons of hemp could be produced in the European Union.  Hemp is a legal crop in the European Union (if it contains a low percentage of [[THC]] and the farmer follow some other EU rules) but hemp has not become the big commercial success that Herer anticipated. In 2010/2011, a total of 11,000 ha of hemp was cultivated in the [[European Union|EU]], a decline compared with the previous year.&lt;ref name="EUSTAT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/statistics/agricultural/2011/pdf/full-report_en.pdf |title=Agriculture in the European Union, Statistical and Economic Information 2011, European Union Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development, page 283 |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture''' presented at the annual conference of the [[American Library Association]] is tribute to the work of Jean E. Coleman to ensure that all citizens, particularly [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and [[adult learners]], have access to quality library services. Dr. Coleman directed the [[American Library Association]], Office for Literacy and Outreach Services (OLOS) which serves the Association by identifying and promoting library services that support equitable access to the knowledge and information stored in our libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Lippincott, Kate, Comp.; And Others. ''25 Years of Outreach: A Bibliographic Timeline of the American Library Association, Office for Literacy and Outreach Services.'' 1996. ERIC ED396755 http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED396755&lt;/ref&gt; OLOS focuses attention on services that are inclusive of traditionally underserved populations, including new and non-readers, people geographically isolated, people with disabilities, rural and urban poor people, and people generally discriminated against based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identification, age, language and social class. In support of this mission OLOS sponsors the Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture each year at the annual American Library Association conference.

== Jean E. Coleman ==

The Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture series is an opportunity for library workers to learn more about their roles in providing equity of access. The Social Responsibilities Round Table Action Council of the [[American Library Association]] approved the following testimonial to the work of [[African American]] librarian Jean Coleman in outreach during her work from 1973 to 1986 for the ALA Office for Library Outreach Services (now Office for Literacy and Outreach Services: OLOS):

:Jean Coleman . . . was outstanding in her willingness to listen to the members of the groups she worked with and to make their wishes effective, translating ideas into action and program, unlike the model of the staff who organizes the agenda and steers the meetings in a controlled setting.
:
:She offered her services especially warmly to the minority librarians and those from small libraries, and did not play a career-promoting role of special services for the powerful. She therefore fully represented the original concerns of ALA in proposing the many outreach organizations and diverse programs under the OLOS umbrella.
:
:She is especially missed by those who found in her the education to become competent officers and received from her the support to make their groups effective.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Coleman Testimonial. ''Library Journal''. May 1, 1987, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

So important were her contributions to the world of diversity in librarianship, that in 1999 it was noted that the Smithsonian Institution accepted two items for its collection from Coleman's estate, including two Apache toy cradle boards, and a sand painting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annals of the Smithsonian Institution 1999 National Collections Program|url=https://archive.org/stream/annalsofsmithson1999smit/annalsofsmithson1999smit_djvu.txt|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==

For background on the development of outreach services in U.S. libraries  ''The evolution of library outreach 1960-75''&lt;ref&gt;Weibel, Kathleen. 1983. ''The evolution of library outreach 1960-75 and its effect on reader services: some considerations.'' [Champaign]: University of Illinois, Graduate School of Library and Information Science.&lt;/ref&gt; provides historical background in the context of the [[War on Poverty]]. Jean Coleman's legacy is the evolving mission of the Office of Literacy and Outreach Services. This also includes the ideals of equity of access. [[Carla Hayden]] took equity of access as her theme when she was American Library Association president (2003–04). A book written during Hayden's presidency, ''From outreach to equity innovative models of library policy and practice'' includes an introduction coauthored by Jean E. Coleman's successor, Satia Orange (director, OLOS). The book suggests reframing`outreach based on `equity rather than underserved populations.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Robin. 2004. ''From outreach to equity innovative models of library policy and practice.'' Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Another project highlighting the work of OLOS initiated by President Hayden was the report,  ''Rocks in the Whirlpool: Equity of Access and the American Library Association''.&lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña. 2002. ''Rocks in the Whirlpool: Equity of Access and the American Library Association''. ERIC ED462981&lt;/ref&gt; which examines unifying visions for equity of access and making new technologies work for human development.

The '''Kurdish Academy of Language''' (KAL) is an Open Global Kurdish Linguistic Network dedicated to Kurdish language research.  From its birth in late 1992, KAL has raised issues relating to all aspects of the Kurdish language, in particular the Kurdish Writing systems. The academy's main goal is to enrich and unify [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/1|title = About Kurdish Academy of Language (KAL)|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a partial list of [[Arizona ballot proposition]]s.

The [[Initiatives and referendums in the United States|initiative and referendum]] process in [[Arizona]] has been in use since the beginning.  The first initiative was passed the same year Arizona was granted statehood when on November 5, 1912, an initiative relating to [[women's suffrage]] was passed by a greater than two to one margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Arizona.htm iandrinstitute.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209035718/http://www.iandrinstitute.org/Arizona.htm |date=2007-02-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative process has long been a staple of Arizona politics, with 15 proposals appearing in the 1914 election, and recently in 2006 when voters were presented with 19.

Prior to 1976, ballot propositions were not assigned a measure number.  Since then, they have been identified by a 3-digit number.  Ballot propositions beginning with "1" are initiatives and referendums to amend the state constitution, those beginning with "2" are initiatives to amend state statutes, and those beginning with "3" are referendums on acts to amend state statutes.

Since 2006, the document archive website [[WikiLeaks]] has published anonymous submissions of documents that are generally unavailable to the [[general public]].

==2006–2008==

===Apparent Somali assassination order===
WikiLeaks posted its first document in December 2006, a decision to assassinate government officials, signed by Sheikh [[Hassan Dahir Aweys]].&lt;ref name=Khatchdourian/&gt; ''[[The New Yorker]]'' has reported that 

{{blockquote|[Julian] Assange and the others were uncertain of its authenticity, but they thought that readers, using Wikipedia-like features of the site, would help analyze it. They published the decision with a lengthy commentary, which asked, "Is it a bold manifesto by a flamboyant Islamic militant with links to Bin Laden? Or is it a clever smear by US intelligence, designed to discredit the Union, fracture Somali alliances and manipulate China?" ... The document's authenticity was never determined, and news about WikiLeaks quickly superseded the leak itself.&lt;ref name="Khatchdourian"&gt;{{cite news |first=Raffi |last=Khatchadourian |date=7 June 2010  |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/06/07/100607fa_fact_khatchadourian?printable=true |title=No Secrets: Julian Assange's Mission for total transparency |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Daniel arap Moi family corruption===
On 31 August 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' featured on its front page a story about corruption by the family of the former Kenyan leader [[Daniel arap Moi]]. The newspaper stated that the source of the information was WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=| title=The looting of Kenya | url=https://www.theguardian.com/kenya/story/0,,2159757,00.html | work=The Guardian | date=31 August 2007| accessdate=28 February 2008 | location=London | first=Xan | last=Rice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bank Julius Baer lawsuit===
{{Main|Bank Julius Baer vs. Wikileaks lawsuit}}
In February 2008, the wikileaks.org [[domain name]] was taken offline after the Swiss Bank [[Julius Baer]] sued WikiLeaks and the wikileaks.org [[domain registrar]], [[Dynadot]], in [[Government of California#The Superior Courts of California|a court in]] California, United States, and obtained a permanent [[injunction]] ordering the shutdown.&lt;ref name=injunction&gt;{{cite press release | author=| title=Wikileaks.org under injunction | url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks.org_under_injunction | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306005837/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks.org_under_injunction | archivedate=6 March 2008 | publisher=WikiLeaks | date=18 February 2008 | accessdate=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.justia.com/cases/featured/california/candce/3:2008cv00824/200125/ |title=Bank Julius Baer &amp; Co. Ltd. et al. v. Wikileaks et al |publisher=News.justia.com |accessdate=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks had hosted allegations of illegal activities at the bank's [[Cayman Islands]] branch.&lt;ref name=injunction/&gt; WikiLeaks' U.S. Registrar, Dynadot, complied with the order by removing its DNS entries. However, the website remained accessible via its numeric IP address, and online activists immediately mirrored WikiLeaks at dozens of alternative websites worldwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1039527/judge-rethinks-wikileaks |title=Judge reverses Wikileaks injunction |publisher=The Inquirer |date=2 March 2008 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] filed a motion protesting the censorship of WikiLeaks. The [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]] assembled a coalition of media and press that filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief on WikiLeaks' behalf. The coalition included major U.S. newspaper publishers and press organisations, such as the [[American Society of News Editors]], the [[Associated Press]], the [[Citizen Media Law Project]], the [[E. W. Scripps Company]], the [[Gannett Company]], the [[Hearst Corporation]], the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the [[National Newspaper Publishers Association]], the [[Newspaper Association of America]] and the [[Society of Professional Journalists]]. The coalition requested to be heard as a friend of the court to call attention to relevant points of law that it believed the court had overlooked (on the grounds that WikiLeaks had not appeared in court to defend itself, and that no First Amendment issues had yet been raised before the court). Amongst other things, the coalition argued that:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;WikiLeaks provides a forum for dissidents and whistleblowers across the globe to post documents, but the Dynadot injunction imposes a prior restraint that drastically curtails access to Wikileaks from the Internet based on a limited number of postings challenged by Plaintiffs. The Dynadot injunction therefore violates the bedrock principle that an injunction cannot enjoin all communication by a publisher or other speaker.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same judge, Jeffrey White, who issued the injunction vacated it on 29 February 2008, citing [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] concerns and questions about legal [[jurisdiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Philipp Gollner | work=Reuters| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSN2927431720080229 | title=Judge reverses ruling in Julius Baer leak case | date=29 February 2008 | accessdate=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks was thus able to bring its site online again. The bank dropped the case on 5 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.informationweek.com/management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206902154

|publisher=InformationWeek
|date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also denied the bank's request for an order prohibiting the website's publication.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The executive director of the [[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press]], Lucy Dalglish, commented: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's not very often a federal judge does a 180 degree turn in a case and dissolves an order. But we're very pleased the judge recognized the constitutional implications in this prior restraint.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Guantanamo Bay procedures===
A copy of ''[[Camp Delta Standard Operating Procedures|Standard Operating Procedures for Camp Delta]]''–the protocol of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]–dated March 2003 was released on the WikiLeaks website on 7 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/11/gitmo "Sensitive Guantánamo Bay Manual Leaked Through Wiki Site"], [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] 14 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The document, named "gitmo-sop.pdf", is also mirrored at ''The Guardian.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2007/11/15/gitmosop.pdf specific address] at ''The Guardian.''&lt;/ref&gt; Its release revealed some of the restrictions placed over detainees at the camp, including the designation of some prisoners as off-limits to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], something that the U.S. military had in the past repeatedly denied.&lt;ref name='Reuters 15 November 2007'&gt;{{cite news | first=| last=| title=Guantanamo operating manual posted on Internet | date=15 November 2007 | publisher=| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN1424207020071114?pageNumber=1 | work=Reuters | pages=| accessdate=15 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2007, WikiLeaks released a copy of the 2004 edition of the manual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure_%282004%29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403235835/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Camp_Delta_Standard_Operating_Procedure_%282004%29 |archivedate=3 April 2008 |title=Camp Delta Operating Procedure (2004) |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with a detailed analysis of the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Changes_in_Guantanamo_Bay_SOP_manual_(2003-2004) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404110524/https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Changes_in_Guantanamo_Bay_SOP_manual_%282003-2004%29 |archivedate=4 April 2008 |title=Changes in Guantanamo SOP manual (2003–2004) |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan dissent in China===
On 24 March 2008, WikiLeaks made 35 uncensored videos of civil unrest in Tibet available for viewing, to get around official Chinese censorship during the worst of the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/mar/19/digitalmedia.tibet "Wikileaks defies 'great firewall of China'"], ''The Guardian'', 19 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientology===
On 24 March 2008, WikiLeaks published what they referred to as "the collected secret 'bibles' of [[Scientology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/08/church_of_scientology_contacts_wikileaks/|title=Scientology threatens Wikileaks with injunction|publisher=The Register|date=8 April 2008|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 2008, they reported receiving a letter (dated 27 March) from the [[Religious Technology Center]] claiming ownership of the several documents pertaining to [[Operating Thetan|OT Levels]] within the [[Church of Scientology]]. These same documents were at the center of [[Scientology vs the Internet#The Xenu revelation|a 1994 scandal]]. The email stated:

{{quote|The Advanced Technology materials are unpublished, copyrighted works. Please be advised that your customer's action in this regard violates United States copyright law. Accordingly, we ask for your help in removing these works immediately from your service.|[[Moxon &amp; Kobrin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Church of Scientology collected Operating Thetan Documents, including full text of legal letter.
|date=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The letter continued on to request the release of the logs of the uploader, which would remove their anonymity. WikiLeaks responded with a statement released on [[Wikinews]] stating: "in response to the attempted suppression, WikiLeaks will release several thousand additional pages of Scientology material next week",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology_warns_Wikileaks_over_documents|title=Church of Scientology warns WikiLeaks over documents|date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did so.

===Sarah Palin's Yahoo! email account contents===
{{Main|Sarah Palin email hack}}
In September 2008, during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election campaigns]], the contents of a Yahoo! account belonging to [[Sarah Palin]] (the running mate of Republican presidential nominee [[John McCain]]) were posted on WikiLeaks after being hacked into by members of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;See the article "Anonymous (Group)"&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged by Wired that contents of the mailbox indicate that she used the private Yahoo! account to send work-related messages, in violation of public record laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/09/group-posts-e-m.html|publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|title=Group Posts E-Mail Hacked From Palin Account&amp;nbsp;– Update | first=Kim|last=Zetter|date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hacking of the account was widely reported in mainstream news outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/17/AR2008091703304.html?hpid=topnews|title=Hackers Access Palin's Personal E-Mail, Post Some Online|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|author2=Karl Vick|date=18 September 2008|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/09/18/palins-e-mail-hacked/|title=FBI, Secret Service Investigate Hacking of Palin's E-mail|date=18 September 2008|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=18 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/sarahpalin/2980391/Sarah-Palins-email-account-broken-into-by-hackers.html|title=Sarah Palin's email account broken into by hackers |last=Swaine|first=Jon|date=18 September 2008|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=18 September 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although WikiLeaks was able to conceal the hacker's identity, the source of the Palin emails was eventually publicly identified as [[David Kernell]], a 20-year-old economics student at the University of Tennessee and the son of Democratic Tennessee State Representative [[Mike Kernell]] from Memphis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://knoxville.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/2008/kxhacking100808.htm |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation&amp;nbsp;– Knoxville Division&amp;nbsp;– Press Releases&amp;nbsp;– Department of Justice |publisher=Knoxville.fbi.gov |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose email address (as listed on various social networking sites) was linked to the hacker's identity on Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/09/21/160222 | title=Palin Email Hacker Found | work=Slashdot | accessdate=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kernell attempted to conceal his identity by using the anonymous proxy service ctunnel.com, but, because of the illegal nature of the access, ctunnel website administrator Gabriel Ramuglia assisted the FBI in tracking down the source of the hack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/18/palin_email_investigation/ | title=Memo to US Secret Service: Net proxy may pinpoint Palin email hackers | work=TheRegister | accessdate=21 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killings by the Kenyan police===
WikiLeaks publicised reports on [[extrajudicial execution]]s by Kenyan police for one week starting 1 November 2008 on its home page. Two of the human rights investigators involved, [[Oscar Kamau Kingara]] and [[John Paul Oulu]], who made major contributions to a [[Kenya National Commission on Human Rights]] (KNCHR) report that was redistributed by WikiLeaks, ''The Cry of Blood – Report on Extra-Judicial Killings and Disappearances'',&lt;ref name="Cry_of_Blood"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title='The Cry of Blood' – Report on Extra-Judicial Killings and Disappearances |work= |publisher=[[Kenya National Commission on Human Rights]]/[[Enforced Disappearances Information Exchange Center]] |date=25 September 2008 |url=http://www.ediec.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Kenia/KNCHR_REPORT_ON_POLICE.pdf |format= |doi= |accessdate=29 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vKBp2oC5?url=http://www.ediec.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Kenia/KNCHR_REPORT_ON_POLICE.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were assassinated several months later, on 5 March 2009.&lt;ref name="HawaiiFP_WLwriters"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Wikileaks writers killed in Kenya| work =| publisher =Hawai'i Free Press/[[WikiLeaks]]| date =9 March 2009| url =http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/main/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/502/Wikileaks-writers-killed-in-Kenya.aspx |format =| doi =| accessdate =29 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vKEIehFU?url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/main/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/502/Wikileaks-writers-killed-in-Kenya.aspx |archivedate=29 December 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |first=Tristan|last=McConnell|title=Rights activist Oscar Kamau Kingara shot dead in central Nairobi |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5860870.ece|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=|date=7 March 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vKFs7tQ7?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article5860870.ece |archivedate=29 December 2010 |deadurl=no |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks called for information on the assassination.&lt;ref name="HawaiiFP_WLwriters" /&gt; In 2009, [[Amnesty International]] UK gave WikiLeaks and Julian Assange an award for the distribution of the KNCHR's ''The Cry of Blood'' report.&lt;ref name="WL_Kenya_2009_AIUK"&gt;{{cite web| last =WikiLeaks| first =| authorlink =WikiLeaks| title =WikiLeaks wins Amnesty International 2009 Media Award| work =| publisher =[[WikiLeaks]]| date =2 June 2009| url =http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/WikiLeaks_wins_Amnesty_International_2009_Media_Award/| format =| doi =| accessdate =29 December 2010| archiveurl =https://www.webcitation.org/5vKChLFQY?url=http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/WikiLeaks_wins_Amnesty_International_2009_Media_Award/| archivedate =28 December 2010| deadurl =yes| df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BNP membership list===
After briefly appearing on a blog, the membership list of the far-right [[British National Party]] was posted to WikiLeaks on 18 November 2008. The name, address, age and occupation of many of the 13,500 members were given, including several police officers, two solicitors, four ministers of religion, at least one doctor, and a number of primary and secondary school teachers. In Britain, police officers are banned from joining or promoting the BNP, and at least one officer was dismissed for being a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7956824.stm|title='BNP membership' officer sacked |publisher=BBC | accessdate=23 March 2009 | date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNP was known for going to considerable lengths to conceal the identities of members. On 19 November, BNP leader [[Nick Griffin]] stated that he knew the identity of the person who initially leaked the list on 17 November, describing him as a "hardliner" senior employee who left the party in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/19/bnp-list | title=BNP membership list posted online by former 'hardliner' |work=The Guardian | accessdate=19 November 2008 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Cobain | date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20081118214827111 | title=BNP Membership List Exposed | publisher=Infoshop News | accessdate=19 November 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220114017/http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20081118214827111 | archivedate=20 December 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1087101/Police-officer-faces-investigation-outed-BNP-supporter-membership-leak.html | title=Police officer faces investigation after being 'outed' as BNP supporter in membership leak | publisher=DailyMail | accessdate=19 November 2008 | location=London | first1=Michael | last1=Lea | first2=Nicola | last2=Boden | date=19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 2009, a list of BNP members from April 2009 was leaked.

===Barclays Bank tax avoidance===
In March 2009 documents concerning complex arrangements made by [[Barclays Bank]] to avoid tax appeared on Wikileaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_Guardian:_Censored_Barclays_tax_avoidance_leaked_memos%2C_16_Mar_2009 |title='&amp;#39;Wikileaks'&amp;#39;, 16 March 2009 |publisher=Wikileaks.org |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://weblogs3.nrc.nl/klaver/2009/03/17/guardian-moet-documenten-van-site-verwijderen/ [[NRC Handelsblad]]'', 17 March 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120802105804/http://weblogs3.nrc.nl/klaver/2009/03/17/guardian-moet-documenten-van-site-verwijderen/ |date=2 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents had been ordered to be removed from the website of ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/06/wikileaks-wikipedia-indiana-jones|title=Read all about it|publisher=The Guardian|author=Oliver Luft|date=6 July 2009|accessdate=7 December 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_Guardian:_Censored_Barclays_tax_avoidance_leaked_memos%2C_16_Mar_2009 |title=Barclays Bank gags Guardian over leaked memos detailing offshore tax scam |publisher=WikiLeaks |accessdate=17 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414025059/http://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_Guardian%3A_Censored_Barclays_tax_avoidance_leaked_memos%2C_16_Mar_2009 |archivedate=14 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial on the issue, ''The Guardian'' pointed out that, due to the mismatch of resources, tax collectors ([[HMRC]]) now have to rely on websites such as Wikileaks to obtain such documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/mar/17/barclays-tax-secret-documents |title='&amp;#39;The Guardian'&amp;#39;, 17 March 2009 |publisher=Guardian |date= 17 March 2009|accessdate=2013-02-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet censorship lists===
WikiLeaks has published the lists of forbidden or illegal web addresses for several countries.

On 19 March 2009, WikiLeaks published what was alleged to be the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]]'s blacklist of sites to be banned under [[Internet censorship in Australia|Australia's proposed laws on Internet censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efa.org.au/2009/03/19/leaked-government-blacklist-confirms-worst-fears/|title=Leaked Government blacklist confirms worst fears|author=Colin Jacobs|publisher=Electronic Frontiers Australia|accessdate=19 March 2009|date=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactions to the publication of the list by the Australian media and politicians were varied. Particular note was made by journalistic outlets of the type of websites on the list; while the Internet censorship scheme submitted by the [[Australian Labor Party]] in 2008 was proposed with the stated intention of preventing access to [[child pornography]] and sites related to terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/03/19/australia-internet-censorship-markets-economy-wikileaks.html|title=Aussie Internet Blacklist Has Gray Areas|author=Vivian Wai-yin Kwok|accessdate=19 March 2009|date=19 March 2009|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the list leaked on WikiLeaks contains a number of sites unrelated to sex crimes involving minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/03/19/1237054961100.html|title=Leaked Australian blacklist reveals banned sites|author=Asher Moses|accessdate=19 March 2009|date=19 March 2009|work=Sydney Morning Herald }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Wikileaks-spills-ACMA-blacklist/0,130061744,339295538,00.htm|title=Wikileaks spills ACMA blacklist|author=Liam Tung|publisher=ZD Net Australia|accessdate=19 March 2009|date=19 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned about the leak, [[Stephen Conroy]], the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy in Australia's [[Rudd Labor Government]], responded by claiming that the list was not the actual list, yet threatening to prosecute anyone involved in distributing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/03/19/2520929.htm?section=australia|title=Leaked blacklist irresponsible, inaccurate: Conroy|publisher=ABC News|author=Nic MacBean|accessdate=19 March 2009|date=19 March 2009|quote="I am aware of reports that a list of URLs has been placed on a website. This is not the ACMA blacklist."  He says that the published list purports to be current on 6 August 2008, and contains approximately 2,400 URLs, whereas the ACMA blacklist for the same date contained 1,061 URLs.  "There are some common URLs to those on the ACMA blacklist. However, ACMA advises that there are URLs on the published list that have never been the subject of a complaint or ACMA investigation, and have never been included on the ACMA blacklist," he said.  "ACMA is investigating this matter and is considering a range of possible actions it may take including referral to the Australian Federal Police. Any Australian involved in making this content publicly available would be at serious risk of criminal prosecution."}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2009, WikiLeaks published an updated list, dated 18 March 2009; it more closely matches the claimed size of the ACMA blacklist, and contains two pages that have been independently confirmed as blacklisted by ACMA.

WikiLeaks also contains details of Internet censorship in Thailand, including lists of censored sites dating back to May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Internet_Censorship_in_Thailand |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116070133/http://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Internet_Censorship_in_Thailand |archivedate=16 January 2008 |title=Internet Censorship in Thailand |publisher=wikileaks.org |accessdate=17 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikileaks published a list of web sites blacklisted by Denmark.&lt;ref name="Guardian20090319"&gt;{{cite news|last=Luft |first=Oliver |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/mar/19/wikileaks-banned-australian-websites |title=Wikileaks taken offline after publishing Australia's banned websites |publisher=Guardian |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=2013-02-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bilderberg Group meeting reports===

===Nuclear accident in Iran===
On 16 July 2009, Iranian news agencies reported that the head of Iran's atomic energy organization [[Gholam Reza Aghazadeh]] had abruptly resigned for unknown reasons after twelve years in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8153775.stm |title=Iranian nuclear chief steps down |publisher=BBC News |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards WikiLeaks released a report disclosing a "serious nuclear accident" at the Iranian [[Nuclear facilities in Iran#Natanz|Natanz nuclear facility]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |first= |url=http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/Serious_nuclear_accident_may_lay_behind_Iranian_nuke_chief%27s_mystery_resignation/ |title=Serious nuclear accident may lay behind Iranian nuke chief's mystery resignation |publisher=wikileaks |date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vLdA2dsZ?url=http://mirror.wikileaks.info/wiki/Serious_nuclear_accident_may_lay_behind_Iranian_nuke_chief's_mystery_resignation/ |archivedate=29 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federation of American Scientists]] (FAS) released statistics that say the number of enriched centrifuges operational in Iran mysteriously declined from about 4,700 to about 3,900 beginning around the time the nuclear incident WikiLeaks mentioned would have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clayton |first=Mark |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0924/Stuxnet-worm-mystery-What-s-the-cyber-weapon-after |title=Stuxnet worm mystery: What's the cyber weapon after? |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=24 September 2010|accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to media reports the accident may have been the direct result of a [[cyberattack]] at Iran's nuclear program, carried out with the [[Stuxnet]] computer worm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/09/27/6_mysteries_about_stuxnet |title=6 mysteries about Stuxnet |publisher=Blog.foreignpolicy.com |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Woodward |url=http://warincontext.org/2010/09/26/iran-confirms-stuxnet-found-at-bushehr-nuclear-power-plant/ |title=Iran confirms Stuxnet found at Bushehr nuclear power plant|publisher=Warincontext.org |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxic dumping in Africa: The Minton report===
In September 2006, commodities giant [[Trafigura]] commissioned an internal report about a [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump|toxic dumping incident in the Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref name="wikileaks"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2009/10/a-gag-too-far/

|accessdate=14 October 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which (according to the United Nations) affected 108,000 people. The document, called the Minton Report, names various harmful chemicals "likely to be present" in the waste and notes that some of them "may cause harm at some distance". The report states that potential health effects include "burns to the skin, eyes and lungs, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of consciousness and death", and suggests that the high number of reported casualties is "consistent with there having been a significant release of hydrogen sulphide gas".

On 11 September 2009, Trafigura's lawyers, [[Carter-Ruck]], obtained a secret "[[super-injunction]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Minton report secret injunction gagging The Guardian on Trafigura |work=WikiLeaks |url=https://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Minton_report_secret_injunction_gagging_The_Guardian_on_Trafigura,_11_Sep_2009 |accessdate=15 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830063054/http://secure.wikileaks.org/wiki/Minton_report_secret_injunction_gagging_The_Guardian_on_Trafigura%2C_11_Sep_2009 |archivedate=30 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; against ''The Guardian'', banning that newspaper from publishing the contents of the document. Trafigura also threatened a number of other media organizations with legal action if they published the report's contents, including the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;ref name="wikileaks"/&gt; and ''The Chemical Engineer'' magazine.&lt;ref name="duckett"&gt;{{cite news

On 12 October, Carter-Ruck warned ''The Guardian'' against mentioning the content of a parliamentary question that was due to be asked about the report. Instead, the paper published an article stating that they were unable to report on an unspecified question and claiming that the situation appeared to "call into question privileges guaranteeing [[freedom of speech|free speech]] established under the [[Bill of Rights 1689|1689 Bill of Rights]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh, David (12 October 2009).

On 15 March 2010, WikiLeaks released a secret 32-page [[U.S. Department of Defense]] Counterintelligence Analysis Report from March 2008. The document described some prominent reports leaked on the website. These related to U.S. security interests, and described potential methods of marginalizing the organization. WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange said that some details in the Army report were inaccurate and its recommendations flawed,&lt;ref name="USarmyintel"&gt;{{cite web

The report discussed deterring potential whistleblowers via termination of employment and criminal prosecution of any existing or former insiders, leakers or whistleblowers. Reasons for the report include notable leaks such as U.S. equipment expenditure, human rights violations in Guantanamo Bay, and the [[First Battle of Fallujah|battle over the Iraqi town of Fallujah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Chelsea Manning====
{{Main|Chelsea Manning}}

A 22-year-old [[US Army]] [[intelligence analyst]], [[Private First Class|PFC]] (formerly [[Specialist (rank)|SPC]]) Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning), was arrested after alleged chat logs were turned in to the authorities by former hacker [[Adrian Lamo]], in whom she had confided. Manning reportedly told Lamo she had leaked the Baghdad airstrike video, in addition to a video of the [[Granai airstrike]] and around 260,000 diplomatic cables, to WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/leak/ | authorlink1=Kevin Poulsen | first1=Kevin | last1=Poulsen | authorlink2=Kim Zetter | first2=Kim | last2=Zetter | title=U.S. Intelligence Analyst Arrested in Wikileaks Video Probe | newspaper=Wired |date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCManning&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10254072.stm | title=US intelligence analyst arrested over security leaks | date=7 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks said "allegations in Wired that we have been sent 260,000 classified US embassy cables are, as far as we can tell, incorrect."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first=Jonathan | last=Fildes | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10255887.stm | title=Hacker explains why he reported 'Wikileaks source' | date=7 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; WikiLeaks have said that they are unable as yet to confirm whether or not Manning was actually the source of the video, stating "we never collect personal information on our sources", but that they have nonetheless "taken steps to arrange for (Manning's) protection and legal defence."&lt;ref name=BBCManning/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fildes8&gt;{{cite news | first=Jonathan | last=Fildes | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10265430.stm | title=Wikileaks site unfazed by arrest of U.S. army 'source' | date=8 June 2010 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 June Julian Assange told ''The Guardian'' that WikiLeaks had hired three US criminal lawyers to defend Manning but that they had not been given access to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ian | last=Traynor | title=WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange breaks cover but will avoid America | newspaper=[[guardian.co.uk]] | date=21 June 2010 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jun/21/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-breaks-cover | accessdate=21 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2013, Manning confessed in open court to providing vast archives of military and diplomatic files to [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref name="Confession to 10 crimes Manning"&gt;{{cite news|last=SAVAGE|first=CHARLIE|title=Soldier Admits Providing Files To WikiLeaks|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1 March 2013|author2=Scott Shane|page=3/1/13 N.Y.

Manning reportedly wrote, "Everywhere there's a U.S. post, there's a diplomatic scandal that will be revealed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/06/leak/ |author=Kevin Poulsen and Kim Zetter |title=U.S. Intelligence Analyst Arrested in Wikileaks Video Probe |publisher=Wired |date=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Washington Post'', she also described the cables as "explaining how the first world exploits the third, in detail, from an internal perspective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/09/AR2010060906170.html |author=Ellen Nakashima |title=Messages from alleged leaker Chelsea Manning portray him as despondent soldier |work=The Washington Post| date=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents were released to the public on 25 July 2010. On 29 July 2010 WikiLeaks added a 1.4 GB "[[insurance file]]" to the Afghan War Diary page, whose decryption details would be released if WikiLeaks or Assange were harmed.&lt;ref name="wired_insurance"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zetter|first=Kim|title=WikiLeaks Posts Mysterious 'Insurance' File|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/wikileaks-insurance-file/|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_dns_insuranceaes"&gt;{{cite news | first=Victoria | last=Ward | pages=| title=WikiLeaks website disconnected as US company withdraws support | date=3 December 2010 | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8178457/WikiLeaks-website-disconnected-as-US-company-withdraws-support.html |accessdate=3 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uhylLWl9?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/wikileaks/8178457/WikiLeaks-website-disconnected-as-US-company-withdraws-support.html |archivedate=3 December 2010 |deadurl=no | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 15,000 of the 92,000 documents have not yet been released on WikiLeaks, as the group is currently reviewing the documents to remove some of the sources of the information. Speaking to a group in London in August 2010, Assange said that the group will "absolutely" release the remaining documents. He stated that WikiLeaks has requested help from the Pentagon and human-rights groups to help redact the names, but has not received any assistance. He also stated that WikiLeaks is "not obligated to protect other people's sources...unless it is from unjust retribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pentagon Slams WikiLeaks' Plan to Post More War Logs |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704407804575425900461793766?mod=WSJ_article_LatestHeadlines#articleTabs%3Darticle|accessdate=13 August 2010|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=12 August 2010|author=Julian E.

According to a report on the Daily Beast website, the Obama administration has asked Britain, Germany and Australia among others to consider bringing criminal charges against Assange for the Afghan war leaks and to help limit Assange's travels across international borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shenon|first=Philip|title=U.S. Urges Allies to Crack Down on WikiLeaks|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-08-10/a-western-crackdown-on-wikileaks/|publisher=The Daily Beast|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, a joint investigation by the Army and the Federal Bureau of Investigation may try to prosecute "Mr. Assange and others involved on grounds they encouraged the theft of government property".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prosecutors Eye WikiLeaks Charges |first1=Adam |last1=Entous |first2=Evan |last2=Perez |url=https://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704488404575441673460880204.html |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=21 August 2010 |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australia Defence Association (ADA) stated that WikiLeaks' [[Julian Assange]] "could have committed a serious criminal offence in helping an enemy of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF)."&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news |title=Assange may have committed offence: ADA |first=|last=|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/assange-may-have-committed-offence-ada-20100728-10vp8.html |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |agency=Australian Associated Press |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil James, the executive director of ADA, states: "Put bluntly, Wikileaks is not authorised in international or Australian law, nor equipped morally or operationally, to judge whether open publication of such material risks the safety, security, morale and legitimate objectives of Australian and allied troops fighting in a UN-endorsed military operation."&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

WikiLeaks' recent leaking of classified U.S. intelligence has been described by commentator of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as having "endangered the lives of Afghan informants" and "the dozens of Afghan civilians named in the document dump as U.S. military informants. Their lives, as well as those of their entire families, are now at terrible risk of Taliban reprisal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703940904575395500694117006?mod=googlenews_wsj#articleTabs%3Darticle|title=WikiLeaks 'Bastards'|work=The Wall Street Journal| date=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When interviewed, Assange stated that WikiLeaks has withheld some 15,000 documents that identify informants to avoid putting their lives at risk. Specifically, Voice of America reported in August 2010 that Assange, responding to such criticisms, stated that the 15,000 still held documents are being reviewed "line by line," and that the names of "innocent parties who are under reasonable threat" will be removed.&lt;ref

Following the [[Love Parade stampede]] in [[Duisburg]], Germany on 24 July 2010, the local news blog ''Xtranews'' published internal documents of the city administration regarding Love Parade planning and actions by the authorities. The city government reacted by acquiring a court order on 16 August forcing ''Xtranews'' to remove the documents from its blog.&lt;ref&gt;Konrad Lischka: [http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,712408,00.html ''Einstweilige Verfügung&amp;nbsp;– Duisburg verbietet Blogger-Veröffentlichung zur Love Parade''] at [[Spiegel Online]] on 18 August 2010 (German)&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, however, after the documents had surfaced on other websites as well, the government stated that it would not conduct any further legal actions against the publication of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdr.de/themen/panorama/loveparade_2010/aktuell/100818.jhtml ''Loveparade-Dokumente offen im Internet''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221123830/http://www.wdr.de/themen/panorama/loveparade_2010/aktuell/100818.jhtml |date=21 December 2010 }} at [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|wdr.de]] (German.

In October 2010, it was reported that WikiLeaks was planning to release up to 400,000 documents relating to the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=WikiLeaks May Release 400,000 Iraq War Documents| first=| last=| publisher=[[CBS News]]| date=16 October 2010 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/16/national/main6964276.shtml | accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julian Assange initially denied the reports, stating: "WikiLeaks does not speak about upcoming releases dates, indeed, with very rare exceptions we do not communicate any specific information about upcoming releases, since that simply provides fodder for abusive organizations to get their spin machines ready."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Where do all these claims about WikiLeaks doing something on Iraq today (Monday) come from? | first=Julian | last=Assange | publisher=WikiLeaks| date=18 October 2010 | url=http://www.twitlonger.com/show/6hqu1n| accessdate=18 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' reported on 21 October 2010 that it had received almost 400,000 Iraq war documents from WikiLeaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Iraq war logs: secret files show how US ignored torture |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=22 October 2010 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/22/iraq-war-logs-military-leaks | accessdate=22 October 2010 | first1=Nick | last1=Davies | first2=Jonathan | last2=Steele | first3=David | last3=Leigh}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 October 2010, [[Al Jazeera]] was the first to release analyses of the leak, dubbed ''The War Logs''. WikiLeaks posted a [[Twitter|tweet]] that "Al Jazeera have broken our embargo by 30 minutes. We release everyone from their Iraq War Logs embargoes." This prompted other news organizations to release their articles based on the source material. The release of the documents coincided with a return of the main wikileaks.org website, which had been offering no content since 30 September 2010.

The BBC quoted [[The Pentagon]] referring to the Iraq War Logs as "the largest leak of classified documents in its history." Media coverage of the leaked documents focused on claims that the U.S. government had ignored reports of [[torture]] by the Iraqi authorities during the period after the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Huge Wikileaks release shows US 'ignored Iraq torture' |publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-11611319 |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Assange is quoted as saying, "Of course, abusive, Titanic organizations, when exposed, grasp at all sorts of ridiculous straws to try and distract the public from the true nature of the abuse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/US/11/29/wikileaks/index.html| title=Clinton condemns leak as 'attack on international community'| publisher=CNN| date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Perry Barlow]], co-founder of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], wrote a tweet saying: "The first serious infowar is now engaged.

Public criticism of the suppression order followed the leak. Human Rights Watch General Counsel Dinah PoKempner, said "Secret law is often unaccountable and inadequately justified.

*In October 2009 ''[[Computer World]]'' published an interview with Assange in which he claimed to be in possession of "5GB from Bank of America" that was from "one of the executive's hard drives."&lt;ref name="5GB BOA"&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nystedt |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9139180/Wikileaks_plans_to_make_the_Web_a_leakier_place |title=Wikileaks plans to make the Web a leakier place |work=[[Computer World]] |date=9 October 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010 ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine published another interview with Assange in which he said WikiLeaks was planning another "megaleak" for early in 2011, which this time would be from inside the private sector and involve "a big U.S. bank".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2010/11/29/an-interview-with-wikileaks-julian-assange/ |title=An Interview With WikiLeaks' Julian Assange |work=[[Forbes]] |date=29 November 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bank of America]]'s stock price fell by three percent following this announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mark |first=Memmott |title=Bank of America Stock Steadies After WikiLeaks-Related Drop |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/12/01/131727190/bank-of-america-stock-steadies-after-wikileaks-related-drop |date=1 December 2010 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |publisher=[[NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange commented on the possible impact of the release that "it could take down a bank or two."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=De La Merced |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/wikileaks-next-target-bank-of-america/ |title=WikiLeaks' Next Target: Bank of America? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 October 2010 |accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, WikiLeaks claims that the information is among the documents that former spokesperson [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] claimed to have destroyed in August 2011.&lt;ref name="Domscheit-Berg shredding"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,781581,00.html |title=Ex-Wikileaks Spokesman Destroyed Unpublished Files |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=22 August 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Twitter 105244480457801728"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/105244480457801728 |title=WikiLeaks Twitter post |publisher=WikiLeaks via Twitter |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In March 2010, [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]], at the time WikiLeaks' spokesperson, announced on a podcast that the organization had in its possession around 37,000 internal e-mails from far-right [[National Democratic Party of Germany]]. He stated explicitly that he was not working on this project himself because it would make him legally vulnerable as a German citizen.

*In December 2010, Assange's lawyer, [[Mark Stephens (lawyer)|Mark Stephens]], said on ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'' that WikiLeaks had information that it considers to be a "thermo-nuclear device" that it would release if the organisation needs to defend itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11921080 |title=Wikileaks' Julian Assange to fight Swedish allegations |publisher=BBC News |date=5 December 2010 |accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In January 2011, [[Rudolf Elmer]] hand delivered two CDs to Assange during a news conference in London.

*In February 2011 in his memoir, ''Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website'', [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] acknowledged that he and another former WikiLeaks volunteer have material submitted to WikiLeaks in their possession (as well as the [[source code]] to the site's submission system) and that they would only return to the organization once it repaired its security and online infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Daniel |last1=Domscheit-Berg |authorlink1=Daniel Domscheit-Berg |first2=Tina |last2=Klopp |others=Trans: Jefferson Chase |title=Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website |year=2011 |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishers]] |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-307-95191-5 |oclc=698363134 |pages=248–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in August 2011 Domscheit-Berg announced that he destroyed all 3,500 documents in his possession.&lt;ref name="Domscheit-Berg shredding"/&gt; The German newspaper ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that the documents included the U.S. government's [[No Fly List]].&lt;ref name="Domscheit-Berg shredding"/&gt; WikiLeaks also claimed that the data destroyed by Domscheit-Berg included the No Fly List.&lt;ref name="Twitter 105244078094028800"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/105244078094028800 |title=WikiLeaks Twitter post |publisher=WikiLeaks via Twitter |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first mention of WikiLeaks having had possession of the No Fly List. WikiLeaks also claimed that the data destroyed included information that it had previously announced was its possession but had not released publicly. This information includes "five gigabytes from the Bank of America" (which was previously reported to be in WikiLeaks' possession in October 2009),&lt;ref name="5GB BOA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twitter 105244480457801728"/&gt; "60,000 emails from the [[National Democratic Party of Germany|NPD]]" (which Domscheit-Berg divulged to be in Wikileaks' possession in March 2010, back when he still worked with the organization),&lt;ref name="NPD e-mails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twitter 105248660677332992"/&gt; and "videos of a major US atrocity in Afghanistan" (which perhaps include the one it claimed to have in May 2010)&lt;ref name="Afghan video"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Twitter 106112150292017152"/&gt; Additionally, WikiLeaks claimed that the documents destroyed included "the internals of around 20 neo-Nazi organizations"&lt;ref name="Twitter 105245148065181698"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/105245148065181698 |title=WikiLeaks Twitter post |publisher=WikiLeaks via Twitter |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "US intercept arrangements for over a hundred internet companies".&lt;ref name="Twitter 105246329529319424"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.twitter.com/wikileaks/status/105246329529319424 |title=WikiLeaks Twitter post |publisher=WikiLeaks via Twitter |date=21 August 2011 |accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of these two leaks were reported to have been in WikiLeaks' possession before.

:With the goal of discovering new breed of Lycean talents, the 1st Lyceum SuperStar was held last January 21, 2012 at the University Grounds. [[Parokya ni Edgar]] gave a ground-breaking performance that was enjoyed by the LPU Community, as well as the outsiders and guests. In the end, Gem Aquino, a freshmen from the College of Business Administration was named as the 1st Lyceum SuperStar.

===Resort Rock===
:Resort Rock: Battle of the Bands 2011 was held last January 22, 2011 at the University Grounds. 12 different bands fought for the title but in the end, Function of Ex took home the top prize. [[Vice Ganda]] performed live on stage at the last sequence of the show before the awarding.

===Acquaintance Party 2k10===
:Acquaintance Party 2k10 is considered as the most memorable acquaintance party in LPU Cavite and was a joint project of LYCESGO, CAS-SG, CCS-SG and COE-SG. The event featured [[Callalily]] as one of the guest performers alongside LPU Cavite student and tween star [[Louise delos Reyes]].

===Your Hue, Guess Who, It's You!===
:This is the 2011 Acquaintance Party that was a joint project of CAS-SG, CoECS-SG and CBA-SG.

===CITHM Pirates Night===
:The 2011 Acquaintance Party/Costume Party of the College of International Tourism and Hospitality Management.

===LPU Garage Sale===
:This project is being spearheaded by LYCESGO annually. The LPU Garage Sale is a week-long event that intends to sell forfeited and second-hand items like books to students in a mega-low price.

===Refresh===
:A three-day tutorial programme spearheaded by LYCESGO and the Lambda Sigma Kappa or the LPU Scholastic Society.

===Mr. and Ms. LPU Cavite===
:Since 2009, LYCESGO has been a major part of the search for the Mr. and Ms. LPU Cavite. This pageant aims to seek for the most beautiful women and most handsome men in the campus that can characterize a good role model among the students of the University and uplift the camaraderie among the colleges of LPU Cavite. Below are the list of the title-holders of the pageant:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19639">'''Macroprudential regulation''' is the approach to financial regulation that aims to mitigate risk to the financial system as a whole (or "[[systemic risk]]"). In the aftermath of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], there is a growing consensus among policymakers and economic researchers about the need to re-orient the regulatory framework towards a macroprudential perspective.

== History ==

As documented by Clement (2010), the term "macroprudential" was first used in the late 1970s in unpublished documents of the Cooke Committee (the precursor of the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]]) and the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref&gt;Clement, P. (2010). The term "macroprudential": origins and evolution. BIS Quarterly Review, March.&lt;/ref&gt; But only in the early 2000s—after two decades of recurrent [[financial crisis|financial crises]] in industrial and, most often, emerging market countries&lt;ref&gt;See Reinhart, C. and Rogoff, K. (2009). ''This time is different: Eight centuries of financial folly''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;—did the macroprudential approach to the regulatory and supervisory framework become increasingly promoted, especially by authorities of the [[Bank for International Settlements]]. A wider agreement on its relevance has been reached as a result of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].

== Objectives and justification ==

The main goal of macroprudential regulation is to reduce the risk and the macroeconomic costs of financial instability. It is recognized as a necessary ingredient to fill the gap between macroeconomic policy and the traditional microprudential regulation of financial institutions (Bank of England, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Bank of England (2009). The role of macroprudential policy. Bank of England Discussion Paper, November.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macroprudential vs microprudential regulation ===

Following Borio (2003), the macro- and microprudential perspectives differ in terms of their ''objectives'' and understanding on the nature of ''risk.''&lt;ref&gt;Borio, C. (2003). Towards a macro-prudential framework for financial supervision and regulation? BIS Working Papers No 128, February.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional microprudential regulation seeks to enhance the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, as opposed to the macroprudential view which focuses on welfare of the financial system as a whole. Further, risk is taken as exogenous under the microprudential perspective, in the sense of assuming that any potential shock triggering a financial crisis has its origin beyond the behavior of the financial system. The macroprudential approach, on the other hand, recognizes that risk factors may configure endogenously, i.e., as a systemic phenomenon. In line with this reasoning, macroprudential policy addresses the interconnectedness of individual financial institutions and markets, as well as their common exposure to economic risk factors. It also focuses on the [[procyclical]] behavior of the financial system in the effort to foster its stability. 

[[File:borio2003.png|thumb|center|550x450px|alt=Table macroprudential vs microprudential.|Differences between macro- and microprudential approaches (Source: C. Borio, 2003).]]

=== Theoretical rationale  ===

On theoretical grounds, it has been argued that a reform of prudential regulation should integrate three different paradigms:&lt;ref&gt;de la Torre, A. and Ize, A. (2009). Regulatory reform: Integrating paradigms. The World Bank. Policy Research Working Paper 4842.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''agency paradigm'', the ''externalities paradigm'', and the ''mood swings paradigm''. The role of macroprudential regulation is particularly stressed by the last two of them.  

The agency paradigm highlights the importance of [[principal–agent problem]]s. Principal-agent risk arises from the separation of ownership and control over an institution which may drive behaviors by the agents in control which would not be in the best interest of the principals (owners). The main argument is that in its role of [[lender of last resort]] and provider of [[deposit insurance]], the government alters the incentives of banks to undertake risks. This is a manifestation of the principal-agent problem known as [[moral hazard]]. More concretely, the coexistence of deposit insurances and insufficiently regulated bank portfolios induces financial institutions to take excessive risks.&lt;ref&gt;See Kareken, J. and Wallace, N. (1978). Deposit insurance and bank regulation: A partial-equilibrium exposition, ''Journal of Business'', 51: 413-438.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm, however, assumes that risk arises from individual malfeasance, and hence it is at odds with the emphasis on the system as a whole which characterizes the macroprudential approach. 

In the externalities paradigm, the key concept is called [[pecuniary externality]]. This is defined as an [[externality]] that arises when one economic agent's action affects the welfare of another agent through effects on prices. As argued by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, B. and Stiglitz, J. (1986). Externalities in economies with imperfect information and incomplete markets, ''Quarterly Journal of Economics'', 101: 229-264.&lt;/ref&gt; when there are [[Distortion (economics)|distortions]] in the economy (such as [[incomplete markets]] or imperfect information),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econport.org/content/handbook/Imperfect-Information.html|title=EconPort - Imperfect Information|website=www.econport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; policy intervention can make everyone better off in a [[Pareto efficiency]] sense. Indeed, a number of authors have shown that when agents face borrowing constraints or other sorts of financial frictions, pecuniary externalities arise and different distortions appear, such as overborrowing, excessive risk-taking, and excessive levels of short-term debt.&lt;ref&gt;For surveys in this literature, see e.g. Bianchi, J. (2010). Credit externalities: Macroeconomic effects and policy implications. ''American Economic Review: Papers &amp; Proceedings'', 100: 398-402; and Korinek, A. (2011). The new economics of prudential capital controls: A research agenda. University of Maryland. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; In these environments macroprudential intervention can improve social efficiency. An [[International Monetary Fund]] policy study argues that risk externalities between financial institutions and from them to the real economy are market failures that justify macroprudential regulation.&lt;ref&gt;De Nicolo, G., G. Favara and L. Ratnovski (2012). Externalities and macroprudential policy, IMF Staff Discussion Note 12/05.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mood swings paradigm, [[animal spirits (Keynes)]] critically influence the behavior of financial institutions' managers, causing excess of optimism in good times and sudden risk retrenchment on the way down. As a result, pricing signals in financial markets may be inefficient, increasing the likelihood of systemic trouble. A role for a forward-looking macroprudential supervisor, moderating uncertainty and alert to the risks of financial innovation, is therefore justified.

== Indicators of systemic risk ==

In order to measure [[systemic risk]], macroprudential regulation relies on several indicators. As mentioned in Borio (2003),&lt;ref&gt;Borio, C. (2003). ''Op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; an important distinction is between measuring contributions to risk of individual institutions (''the cross-sectional dimension'') and measuring the evolution (i.e. procyclicality) of [[systemic risk]] through time (''the time dimension''). 

The cross-sectional dimension of risk can be monitored by tracking [[balance sheet]] information—total assets and their composition, [[liability (financial accounting)]] and capital structure—as well as the value of the institutions' trading securities and securities available for sale. Additionally, other sophisticated financial tools and models have been developed to assess the interconectedness across intermediaries (such as CoVaR),&lt;ref&gt;See Adrian, T. and Brunnermeier, M. (2011). CoVaR. NBER Working Papers 17454, National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;/ref&gt; and each institution's contribution to [[systemic risk]] (identified as "Marginal Expected Shortfall" in Acharya et al., 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, V., Pederssen, L., Phillipon, T. and Richardson, M. (2010). Measuring Systemic Risk. New York University. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; 

To address the time dimension of risk, a wide set of variables are typically used, for instance: ratio of credit to [[GDP]], real [[asset]] prices, ratio of non-core to core liabilities of the banking sector, and monetary aggregates. Some early warning indicators have been developed encompassing these and other pieces of financial data (see, e.g., Borio and Drehmann, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Borio, C. and Drehmann, M. (2009). Assessing the Risk of Banking Crises – Revisited. BIS Quarterly Review, March.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, macro stress tests are employed to identify vulnerabilities in the wake of a simulated adverse outcome.

== Macroprudential tools ==

A large number of instruments have been proposed;&lt;ref&gt;See, ''inter alia'', Shin, H. (2011). Macroprudential policies beyond Basel III. In: BIS Papers No 60, December; Hanson, S., Kashyap, A. and Stein, J. (2011). A macroprudential approach to financial regulation. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 25: 3-28; Goodhart C. and Perotti, E. (2012). Preventive macroprudential policy. VoxEU.org, 29 February; and the references in Galati, G. and Moessner, R. (2011). Macroprudential policy -- a literature review. BIS Working Papers No 337, February.&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is no agreement about which one should play the primary role in the implementation of macroprudential policy. 

Most of these instruments are aimed to prevent the procyclicality of the financial system on the [[asset]] and liability sides, such as:

*Cap on [[loan-to-value ratio]] and loan loss provisions
*Cap on [[debt-to-income ratio]]

The following tools serve the same purpose, but additional specific functions have been attributed to them, as noted below:

*Countercyclical [[capital requirement]] - to avoid excessive balance-sheet shrinkage from banks in trouble.
*Cap on [[Leverage (finance)| leverage]] - to limit [[asset]] growth by tying banks' assets to their [[Equity (finance)|equity]].
*Levy on non-core liabilities - to mitigate pricing distorsions that cause excessive [[asset]] growth.
*Time-varying [[reserve requirement]] - as a means to control capital flows with prudential purposes, especially for emerging economies.

To prevent the accumulation of excessive short-term debt: 

*[[Liquidity]] coverage ratio
*[[Liquidity]] risk charges that penalize short-term funding
*Capital requirement surcharges proportional to size of maturity mismatch
*Minimum haircut requirements on [[asset]]-backed securities

In addition, different types of contingent capital instruments (e.g., "contingent convertibles" and "capital insurance") have been proposed to facilitate bank's recapitalization in a crisis event.).&lt;ref&gt; Raviv, A., (2004). Bank Stability and Market Discipline: Debt-for-Equity Swap versus Subordinated Notes. Brandeis University. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Flannery, M., (2002). No pain, no gain? Effecting market discipline via ‘reverse convertible debentures. Chapter 5 of Hall S. Scott, ed. Capital Adequacy Beyond Basel:
Banking Securities and Insurance, Oxford: Oxford University Press. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation in Basel III ===

Several aspects of [[Basel III]] reflect a macroprudential approach to financial regulation.&lt;ref&gt;See Borio, C. (2011). Rediscovering the macroeconomic roots of financial stability policy: journey, challenges and a way forward. BIS Working Papers No 354, September.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[Basel Committee on Banking Supervision]] acknowledges the systemic significance of financial institutions in the rules text. More concretely, under [[Basel III]] banks' capital requirements have been strengthened and new [[liquidity]] requirements, a leverage cap and a countercyclical capital buffer have been introduced. Also, the largest and most globally active banks are required to hold more and higher-quality capital, which is consistent with the cross-section approach to [[systemic risk]].

=== Effectiveness of macroprudential tools ===

For the case of Spain, Saurina (2009) argues that dynamic loan loss provisions (introduced in July 2000) are helpful to deal with procyclicality in banking, as banks are able to build up buffers for bad times.&lt;ref&gt;Saurina, J. (2009). Dynamic provisioning: The case of Spain. The World Bank. Note Number 7, July.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Using data from the UK, Aiyar et al. (2012) find that unregulated banks in the UK have been able to partially offset changes in credit supply induced by time-varying minimum capital requirements over regulated banks. Hence, they infer a potentially substantial "leakage" of macroprudential regulation of bank capital.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyar, S., Calomiris, C. and Wieladek, T. (2011). Does Macro-Pru leak? Evidence from a UK policy experiment. NBER Working Papers 17822, National Bureau of Economic Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[emerging markets]], several central banks have applied macroprudential policies (e.g., use of reserve requirements) at least since the aftermath of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]]. Most of these central banks' authorities consider that such tools effectively contributed to the resilience of their domestic financial systems in the wake of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;For the case of some Latin American countries, see e.g. Castillo, P., Contreras, A., Quispe, Z. and Rojas, Y. (2011). Política macroprudencial en los países de la región. In: Revista Moneda, Central Bank of Peru.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Costs of macroprudential regulation  ==

There is available theoretical and empirical evidence on the positive effect of finance on long-term economic growth. Accordingly, concerns have been raised about the impact of macroprudential policies on the dynamism of financial markets and, in turn, on investment and [[economic growth]]. Popov and Smets (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Popov, A. and Smets, F. (2012). On the tradeoff between growth and stability: The role of financial markets. VoxEU.org, 3 November.&lt;/ref&gt; thus recommend that macroprudential tools be employed more forcefully during costly booms driven by overborrowing, targeting the sources of externalities but preserving the positive contribution of financial markets to growth. 

In analyzing the costs of higher capital requirements implied by a macroprudential approach, Hanson et al. (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, S., Kashyap, A. and Stein, J. (2011). A macroprudential approach to financial regulation. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 25: 3-28.&lt;/ref&gt; report that the long-run effects on loan rates for borrowers should be quantitatively small.&lt;ref&gt;See also Schanz, J., Aikman, D., Collazos, P., Farag, M., Gregory, D. and Kapadia, S. (2011). The long-term economic impact of higher capital levels. In: BIS Papers No 60, December, as well as the references cited therein.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some theoretical studies indicate that macroprudential policies may have a positive contribution to long-run average growth. Jeanne and Korinek (2011),&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne, O. and Korinek, A. (2011). Booms, Bust and Growth. Johns Hopkins University and University of Maryland. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, show that in a model with externalities of crises that occur under financial liberalization, well-designed macroprudential regulation both reduces crisis risk and increases long-run growth as it mitigates the cycles of [[boom and bust]].

== Institutional aspects ==

The macroprudential supervisory authority may be given to a single entity, existing (such as central banks) or new, or be a shared responsibility among different institutions (e.g., monetary and fiscal authorities). Illustratively, the management of [[systemic risk]] in the United States is centralized in the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] (FSOC), established in 2010. It is chaired by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Secretary of the Treasury]] and its members include the Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve System]] and all the principal U.S. regulatory bodies. In Europe, the task has also been assigned since 2010 to a new body, the [[European Systemic Risk Board]] (ESRB), whose operations are supported by the [[European Central Bank]]. Unlike its U.S. counterpart, the ESRB lacks direct enforcement power.

=== Role of central banks ===

In pursuing their goal of preserving price stability, central banks remain attentive to the evolution of real and financial markets. Thus, a complementary relationship between macroprudential and [[monetary policy]] has been advocated, even if the macroprudential supervisory authority is not given to the central bank itself. This is well reflected by the organizational structure of institutions such as the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] and [[European Systemic Risk Board]], where central bankers have a decisive participation. The question of whether [[monetary policy]] should directly counter financial imbalances remains more controversial, although it has indeed been proposed as a tentative supplementary tool for addressing [[asset]] price bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;See Bernanke, B (2008). Monetary policy and the housing bubble. Speech at the Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association, Atlanta, Georgia. January 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International dimension ===

On the international level, there are several potential sources of leakage and [[arbitrage]] from macroprudential regulation, such as banks' lending via foreign branches and direct cross-border lending.&lt;ref&gt;Bank of England (2009), ''Op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Also, as emerging economies impose controls on capital flows with prudential purposes, other countries may suffer negative [[spillover effects]].&lt;ref&gt;Korinek, A. (2011), ''Op.cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, global coordination of macroprudential policies is considered as necessary to foster their effectiveness.

'''Maintenance actions''', historically referred to as '''socio-emotive actions''', are those [[leadership]] actions taken by one or more members of a group to  enhance the social relationships among group members. They tend to increase the  overall effectiveness of the group and create a more positive atmosphere of  interaction within the group. 

==Concept==

Maintenance actions are contrasted with [[Task Actions]] which are those actions taken to enable the group to complete a specific task or goal.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, D. and Johnson, F. ''Joining Together: Group Theory and Skills''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptually developed by [[social psychologist]] [[Kurt Lewin]] in his extensive research into group interaction during the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;Lewin, K., "Group Decisions and Social Change" in T. Newcomb and E. Hartley (eds.) ''Readings In Social Psychology''. New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt; maintenance actions were extended into the discipline of leadership studies through the work of [[Douglas McGregor]] in his  definitive statement of principles of [[leadership]], ''The Human Side of Enterprise''.&lt;ref&gt;McGregor,D. ''The Human Side of Enterprise.'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Countless texts and "how to" manuals on group and team leadership since Lewin's work have sought to identify those activities which can then be used in group situations to maintain as well as increase  friendship, warmth, and [[attachment theory|attachment]] among the participants of a group.

Maintenance actions can be understood as those activities which maintain the functioning of the group just as a driver of a car maintains the car by putting oil in the engine or making sure that the tires have enough pressure.

==Types==

Lewin specifically identified ten types of maintenance actions: encourager of participation; harmonizer and compromiser; tension reliever; communication helper; evaluator of emotional climate; process observer; standard setter; active listener; trust builder; and interpersonal problem solver. 

The most identifiable and popular of the ten types is the tension reliever or the person who relieves the tension within the group by telling jokes and stories, suggesting breaks or fun (as opposed to task) activities. (Later group and [[leadership]] writers frequently identify the person taking on this role as the group "clown".)

In contrast, often the hardest to identify is that of the process observer, similar to a [[participant observer]], or the person who watches the interaction within the group as it unfolds and shares their observations with the other group members by continually pointing out ways in which the group behaviors become inconsistent or erratic which could throw the group off track in its attempt to accomplish a goal.

The type considered by group [[facilitator]]s to be the most valuable role is that of interpersonal problem solver or the person who has the natural ability to help people solve their problems in a non-professional manner and draws other people in the group to them by their warmth and openness.&lt;ref&gt;Hartford, M. ''Groups In Social Work''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behaviour theory==

The success of Lewin's work in defining these group activities is attributable to his explanation of them in  [[Collective behavior|behavior theory]] terms within the context of [[role theory]] . This was in contrast to both previous and subsequent research which would utilize such picturesque but often unrealistic terms for group behaviors such as the eagle, the bear, or the possum (creating confusion among group participants who may not share the same ideas of animal behavior as the theorist who proposed the terms). Lewin also sought to explain these maintenance actions within the context of immediate experience of the group participant as opposed to roles associated with a person's individual personality. Group [[psychotherapist]] [[Irvin Yalom]]&lt;ref&gt;Yalom, I. ''The Theory and Practice of Group Psychotherapy''. New York: Basic Books, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; presents a contrasting view to Lewin in his position that group behaviors are developed in an individual's first group experiences (primarily in their family of origin) and then carried with them from group to group for the rest of their lives.

Maintenance actions can also be seen as occurring on three levels of interaction within the group.&lt;ref&gt;Garvin, C. and Jones, A. "Group Work" in ''The Encyclopedia of Social Work'' (16th Ed.) Washington, D.C.: NASW Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; On the primary level there are individual actions within the group which can be seen as maintenance actions. On the secondary level there are people whose majority of actions identify them as having a maintenance [[Personality type|personality]]. On the highest level there are groups which take on the role of social interaction and support as their primary goal which are then identified as maintenance groups. Maintenance groups are seen frequently in society as in a [[support group]], collections of people who meet with the intention of bonding and problem solving through shared experiences such as groups of cancer survivors or people coping with the loss of a loved one.

Maintenance actions have moved on to become the core of several [[social psychology]]  theories of leadership and group interaction such as [[Fiedler]]'s distributed actions model of group leadership;&lt;ref&gt;Fiedler, F. ''A Theory of Leadership Effectiveness''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Bales' Interaction Process Analysis model;&lt;ref&gt;Bales, R. ''Interaction Process Analysis''. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; and Blanchard and Hershey's leadership effectiveness model.&lt;ref name=MOB&gt;Blanchard, P. and Hershey, K. ''Management of Organizational Behavior: Utilizing Human Resources''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanchard and Hershey have argued that more successful leaders combine both maintenance and task actions to a certain extent depending on the group members' abilities and experiences in order to achieve the most successful style and process of group leadership. Their concept is vividly underscored in Herman Wouk's popular novel, ''The Caine Mutiny''&lt;ref&gt;Wouk, H. ''The Caine Mutiny''. New York: Doubleday, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; where Wouk contrasts the effectiveness of a total task action oriented leader in the character of Captain Queeg versus the leader who combines maintenance and task actions in the character of Captain De Vriess. In the novel, the failure of Queeg to accurately identify the necessary combination of maintenance and task actions to suit the particular setting of the fictional Navy ship the U.S.S. ''Caine'' may be seen to lead to his inevitable downfall and the "mutiny" of the crew during a particularly life-threatening mission in the midst of a typhoon. This theme was repeated later in a cinematic form more recently in the movie ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'' which pitted a task action oriented Captain (played by Gene Hackman) against a maintenance action Executive officer (played by Denzel Washington) in a battle for the crews' hearts and minds  on a fictitious U.S.  naval submarine.

A more popular view among group leaders and facilitators today is that groups rarely see leaders who exclusively choose one extreme of task actions versus  the other extreme of maintenance actions, and are more likely to see a leader whose style is to combine the two styles of leadership in varying ways in relation to  their own understanding of their ability to lead.&lt;ref  name=MOB/&gt;

The '''Military Erasmus Programme''', formally the '''European initiative for the exchange of young officers inspired by Erasmus''', is an initiative undertaken by the [[European Union]] (EU) member states aimed at developing the exchanges between armed forces of future [[military officers]] as well as their teachers and instructors during their initial education&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2268/100625 (en) Sylvain Paile, Europe for the Future Officers, Officers for the Future Europe – Compendium of the European Military Officers Basic Education, Department of Science and Military Education – Ministry of Defence of Poland, 2011, 226 p., DWS SG WP. Zam. 1168. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and training. Due to the fact that the initiative is implemented by the Member States on a purely voluntary basis, their autonomy with regard to military training is not compromised.

==History==
===Origins===
The number of European crisis management operations and multinational military operations launched by European Union Member States in the framework of the [[Common Security and Defence Policy]] (CSDP) have increased, demonstrating a fast-growing need for a stronger [[interoperability]] of military forces, not only with regard to the pure technical and procedural aspects but also to the ability for the European military officers to work closely and effectively together.

One way to foster this ability is to integrate the education and training of the servicemen and their officers. The European military officers’ educational institutes, and the Member States at a more diplomatic level, have had a long experience and tradition of exchanges, to this end.

The experience of mobility they acquired nevertheless revealed that, due to the particular nature of the education and training they provide, the military institutes could not make full use of all the possibilities offered by the mobility instruments available&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/documents/access-to-council-documents-public-register.aspx?lang=en “Stocktaking of existing exchanges and exchange programmes of national military officers during their basic/initial education and training”, European Security and Defence College, General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union (doc. 12843/08), 9 September 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; which were primarily designed for civilian higher education, such as the [[Erasmus programme]]. A need was identified, therefore, for addressing together these structural obstacles at the European level.

In the second half of 2008, the French EU Presidency then in office launched a programme of reflection on ways to allow greater integration of the initial academic and professional training of young European officers through mobility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu2008.fr/PFUE/lang/en/accueil/PFUE-11_2008/PFUE-13.11.2008/un_seminaire_pour_faire_avancer_le_projet_d__erasmus_militaire.html  “A Seminar to advance the “Military Erasmus” project”, French Presidency of the European Union, 13 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europolitics.info/dossiers/defence-security/military-erasmus-to-commence-in-2009-art150665-52.html “Military Erasmus to commence in 2009”, Nicolas Gros-Verheyde, Europolitics, 28 October 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043039/http://www.europolitics.info/dossiers/defence-security/military-erasmus-to-commence-in-2009-art150665-52.html |date=7 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative for the exchange of young officers, inspired by Erasmus, was launched in November 2008 with the declaration by the European Ministers of Defence, meeting within the [[Council of the European Union]], on the European Security and Defence Policy (2903rd External Relations Council meeting, Brussels 10 and 11 November 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/documents/access-to-council-documents-public-register.aspx?lang=en “Council Conclusions on the ESDP”, 2903rd External relations Council meeting, Brussels, 10 and 11 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation===
The implementation of the initiative is driven by the key idea that exchanges of young officers during their initial training form the cornerstones for the emergence, in the longer run, of the increased interoperability and common culture that are needed for European security and defence. An Implementation Group was created in February 2009 as a task-oriented configuration of the [[European Security and Defence College]]’s&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/ “ESDC – The European Security and Defence College – Rehrl/Weisserth”, video]&lt;/ref&gt; Executive Academic Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/documents/access-to-council-documents-publicregister.aspx?lang=en Council Joint Action 2008/550/CFSP of 23 June 2008 establishing a European Security and Defence College (ESDC) and repealing Joint Action 2005/575/CFSP]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying on contributions and support from the Member States, their institutes and the European Security and Defence College's Secretariat, the Implementation Group very quickly made substantial progress on various aspects of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/NewsWord/en/esdp/113308.doc “Towards a European security and defence culture: The European Initiative for the exchange of young officers, inspired by Erasmus, picks up speed”, Council of the European Union, 11 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File: First IG meeting February 2009.png|thumb|alt=Courtesy of the European Security and Defence College Secretariat, 2009| Implementation Group meeting]]

==Purpose==
Young officers in training are the future military elites, who will have to work ever more closely together for the realisation and consolidation of the Common Security and Defence Policy, regardless of their nationality or their armed forces. It is essential, with view to improve interoperability and to pave the way for a European security and defence culture, that European military students and cadets share parts of their education and training as early as the basic level and become familiar with their future role and responsibilities in international security.

[[File:Naval Academies Superintendents Conference 2011 - Polish Naval Academy.jpg|thumb|alt=Courtesy of the Polish Naval Academy, 2011|Pre-Meeting to the Conference of the Superintendents of the Naval Academies]]

The European initiative for the exchange of young officers, inspired by Erasmus, is meant to lower the barriers which may oppose to free mobility of knowledge, skills and competences of future military officers, their teachers and instructors between the European academies, schools, colleges, universities and training centres. To this end, the initiative supplements the action of the fora that have been created by European military institutes of a same service, such as the Conference of Superintendents of Naval Academies (Navy), the European Air Force Academies (EUAFA – Air Force) and the European Military Academies Commandants’ Seminar (EMACS – Land Forces).

The Conclusions of the Council of the European Union, which founded the European initiative for the exchange of young officers, inspired by Erasmus, have translated these objectives into concrete measures, such as:
• Measures aimed at increasing the number of exchanges, such as the generalisation of the [[Bologna process]], mutual recognition of the outcomes of exchanges in professional training, greater use of Erasmus mobility for students and personnel, opening of national educational opportunities to young European officers;
• Measures aimed at teaching/learning about Europe and its defence, such as the creation of a common module on the Common Security and Defence Policy, promotion of the learning of several foreign languages.


==Activities==
On the basis of the standard curriculum developed by the European Security and Defence College, the Implementation Group created a common module on CSDP specifically addressed to these young audiences and aimed at preparing them for the European and international dimensions of their missions and careers. It was run for the first time in the Portuguese academies in 2009, then by the Spanish, Austrian and Greek initial education and training institutes. After only a year of existence, this module enabled more than 400 young officers to become familiar with the role they may be called to play in European defence in the future.

[[File: Common module Spain Air Force Academy 2010.png|thumb|alt=Courtesy of the Air Force Academy of Spain, 2010| Graduation ceremony after a common module]]

A detailed stocktaking of the European officers’ initial training has been completed, which assists the institutes concerned in identifying partners with whom they organise exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esdc.mil-edu.be/index.php/networking-news Sylvain Paile, European Military Higher Education Stocktaking Report, Council of the European Union DG F (press), 2010, 179 p.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815195812/http://esdc.mil-edu.be/index.php/networking-news |date=15 August 2011 }} {{ISBN|978-92-824-2525-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A forum and a newsletter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emilyo.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=73 “Mobility Newsletter”, European Security and Defence College Secretariat (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; edited by the European Security and Defence College Secretariat, have also been set up for the institutes to communicate regarding supply and demand of exchanges. Communication is also achieved using other channels designed to disseminate information on the initiative, to the military students and the public for example, or to interact with the educational fora for addressing mobility challenges that are specific to one or several armed forces, such as Army, Navy, Air Force or [[Gendarmerie]].

Due to the military nature of these educational exchanges, a framework arrangement&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.milak.at/campus/iep/WorkloadCalculation.php “User’s Guide for Workload’s Calculation of Non-Academic Basic Officer Education”, Harald Gell, 27 November 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed and agreed by the EU Member States. It sets the conditions under which exchanges between Member States – wishing to participate – take place. It also lays down the recognition procedures for the outcomes of exchanges in military professional training. It therefore complements the learning agreements the institutions and the trainees usually set for their exchanges and which do not specifically deal with the military specificity of this form of higher education.

The officers’ work is integrated into their educational process. Therefore, for exchanges of non-academic training modules, the participating institutes agreed within the initiative on best practices aimed at recognising the value of training undertaken abroad as equivalent in principle to national training.

The Member States and their institutes in the European initiative for the exchange of young officers also seek to provide a common European vision of the qualifications an officer should have after successfully completing his or her educational and training process.

Most of the military officers’ education and training institutes are fully integrated into the [[European Higher Education Area]]. Thus, they also investigate the possibility to exchange through the mobility programmes that are shared with their civilian counterparts, such as the Erasmus programme, and many of them have set up exchange programmes with both civilian universities and other military education establishments using these mobility programmes.

Meanwhile, common curricula on issues shared by the European armed forces are being developed on a continuing basis, and national institutes regularly open or adapt existing learning modules to European participation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17337">The '''Olympic Truce''' is a tradition originating from [[Ancient Greece]] that dates back to 776 BC. A "[[truce]]" (Ancient Greek: [[Ekecheiria|ékécheiria]], meaning "laying down of arms") was announced before and during the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] to ensure the host city state (Elis) was not attacked and athletes and spectators could travel safely to the Games and peacefully return to their respective countries.

In 1998, the [[International Olympic Committee]] renewed this tradition by calling upon all nations to observe the Truce during the [[Olympic Games|modern Games]]. The Truce was revived by [[United Nations]] Resolution 48/11 of 25 October 1993,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/events/olympictruce/&lt;/ref&gt; as well by the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]] relating to the world peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Millennium Declaration]], Article 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the Athens Bid Committee committed to reviving the Olympic Truce and promoting it to the world through the [[Olympic flame]] relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olympic Truce Centre|title=Olympic Truce Milestones|url=http://www.olympictruce.org/discover/timeline.php|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the International Olympic Committee announced the establishment of the '''International Olympic Truce Foundation''' and the International Olympic Truce Centre in cooperation with Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.olympictruce.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=268&amp;lang=en | title=The Truce timeline | publisher=International Olympic Truce Center | accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision was to protect the interests of athletes and sport, and to promote peaceful principles in modern day. Each host city was encouraged to embrace the meaning and spirit of the Olympic Truce in the planning and staging of the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic  Truce|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/the-ioc/commissions/international-relations-/olympic-truce/?tab=initiatives-for-peace|website=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

=== 2012 London Summer Games ===

On 22 April 2011 a Member of the House of Lords - [[Michael Bates, Baron Bates]] - began walking over 3000 miles from Olympia to London to highlight the opportunity to bring the Olympic Truce into reality during the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Summer Games]]. [http://www.walkfortruce.org/ Walk for Truce], Lord Bates was successful in securing pledges from a number of governments to both sign and implement the Truce, supported on his journey by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|British Foreign Office]]. Lord Bates arrived back in London on February 15, 2012 and continues to lobby for the cause of the Olympic Truce.

The UK promoted the ideals of the Olympic Truce both domestically, and for the first time internationally.  The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) organised truce activities in the UK including: "Get Set for the Olympic Truce" which encourages young people across the UK to learn about the history of the Olympic Truce, to debate and discuss what the Olympic Truce means to their lives and to undertake an activity to promote peace within their school or community. Materials were promoted to over 20,000 schools registered with Get Set.

Truce Inspire is a ‘truce’ strand of the Inspire programme through which LOCOG specifically looked for projects inspired by the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games which use sport or culture to promote conflict resolution, reconciliation and peace. LOCOG approved a number of projects including: a project led by the University of Ulster which uses sport to support conflict resolution across the education sector; a project providing 200 schools with the opportunity to debate the theme of the Olympic Truce at a Model UN conference; and a project which uses sport to bring together young people from London communities affected by gang rivalry. Cultural Olympiad and the London 2012 Festival organised by LOCOG and the NGO Peace One Day is delivering a truce strand of the Film Nation Shorts project through which 14- to 25-year-olds are invited to create films focused on the truce theme. LOCOG has also partnered with Peace One Day to deliver a series of concerts as part of the London 2012 Festival.

International activities were led by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) which together with [http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/global-issues/london-2012/olympic-truce/ partners promoted the ideals of the Olympic Truce internationally] under the themes of:

* "Local solutions to local problems: Preventing conflict and building peace requires the involvement of the local communities who are most affected. We are looking for opportunities to work with host governments, communities, faith groups, civil society and the media to build relationships across boundaries.
* Legitimate Politics: Legitimate politics are essential for peace. The most peaceful political systems are accountable, give everybody a voice and are trusted to manage difference and accommodate change. We are seeking to work with Parliamentarians and bodies such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and Commonwealth to promote the Truce and encourage public commitments to conflict prevention and peace-building.
* Building a 2012 Truce legacy: Through an active public diplomacy programme we have an opportunity to increase international public interest and involvement in conflict prevention and peace-building and to raise the level of ambition for future Olympic Truces".

Speaking about the FCO's work on the Olympic Truce, Foreign Office Minister Henry Bellingham said
{{Quote|As the Minister with responsibility for Conflict Issues, I am delighted to introduce the FCO's Olympic Truce activities. Our staff in the UK and Missions across the world will undertake activities and events to promote the ideals of peace and conflict resolution ahead of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We want to make the most of this historic opportunity and work with other governments, the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee, National Olympic Committees, the International Paralympic Committee, National Paralympic Committees, NGOs and civil society to promote the principles and ideals of the Olympic Truce.}}

On 28 May 2012 during the visit of Foreign Secretary William Hague to Moscow, the UK and Russian foreign ministries (in recognistion of their countries shared roles as Olympic Hosts in 2012 and 2014) agreed to [http://uk.sitestat.com/fcoweb/ukingov/s?nd.rus.en.about-us.working-with-russia.012-visits.hague-2011.p.pdf.olympic-truce-eng&amp;ns_type=pdf&amp;ns_url=http://ukinrussia.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/21121586/661004282/olympic-truce-eng work together] to promote and support the ideals of the Olympic Truce.

On 12 September 2012 FCO Ministers updated Parliament&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm120912/wmstext/120912m0001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
"It was a real honour for the UK to have the responsibility to promote the Olympic truce message. We worked closely on delivering an international response to the Olympic truce, working with the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic games, the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Culture Media and Sport".

"We wanted to show that the UN resolution could be translated into international action. Our diplomatic missions across our network and the FCO in London arranged over 70 events and activities which showed how important the contribution of youth, women and those with disabilities is in promoting peace through sport, culture, education and wider public engagement. While activities took place in every continent, we specifically wanted to bring the Olympic truce to life in conflict affected and fragile countries".

"The UK is the first games host to deliver this level of international ambition for the Olympic truce. The UN Secretary-General, in the presence of the International Olympic Committee, recognised the UK’s Olympic truce work on the eve of the opening ceremony of the London 2012 games. Now others are seeking to build on our experience. We are currently sharing our experience with the UN Secretary-General’s Special Adviser’s Office on sport and development for peace, as well as with Russia, which will next take stewardship of the Olympic truce in 2013, ahead of the Sochi winter games in 2014. This level of international interest, paired with our continued engagement, will help cement our legacy of encouraging future games hosts to promote the ideals of the Olympic truce in their own ways".

== Logo ==
The official [http://www.olympictruce.org/images/LOGO_TRANS.png Olympic Truce logo] is a graphic with three elements: a dove, flames, and the Olympic rings. The meaning behind the logo is as follows:
:The Olympic Truce is symbolized by the dove of peace with the traditional Olympic flame in the background. In a world that is plagued by wars and animosity, the peace-dove symbol represents one of the IOC's ideals to build a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal. The Olympic flame has brought warm friendship to all the people of the world through sharing and global togetherness. In the symbol, the flame is made up of colourful effervescent elements, reminiscent of festivities experienced in the celebration of the human spirit. These elements represent people of all races coming together for the observance of the Truce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olympic.org|title=Olympic Truce|url=http://www.olympic.org/content/the-ioc/commissions/international-relations-/olympic-truce/|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Support is mainly shown through the resolution.  It is also shown by the Solemn Appeals for Truce made by the UN Secretary General and the President of the General Assembly shortly before the Olympic and Winter Olympic Games. The lead office within the UN system is The United Nations Office on Sport for Development and Peace or UNOSDP. The current UN Special Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace is Wilfried Lemke from Bremen, Germany. UNOSDP is situated at the UN Office at Geneva plus a liaison office at UN HQ in New York.

On 17 October 2011, the international community pledged to observe the Olympic Truce, individually and collectively.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/sport/shared/sport/pdfs/Resolutions/A-RES-66-5/A-RES-66-5_EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For London 2012, the resolution was officially titled “Sport for Peace and Development: Building a Peaceful and Better World through Sport and the Olympic Ideal” and was introduced by LOCOG chairman Sebastian Coe. “The Truce helps to show the world that peace is a possibility," he said Monday in New York City. "It shows the power that sport has to inspire unity, mutual understanding, and respect among different types of people.” Coe exhorted all member states of the UN to respect the ideals of the Truce. “Countries should feel an obligation to respect the Truce because it holds true to the idea that we can coexist without the need for discrimination and fighting," he urged. “It gives us something to strive towards outside of the Olympics and the arena of sport.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=38214 On the Scene -- UN Adopts Olympic Truce] – Around the Rings website&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4526">An '''open-source bounty''' is a monetary [[bounty (reward)|reward]] for completing a task in an [[open-source software]] project.

==Description==
Bounties are usually offered as an incentive for fixing [[software bug]]s or implementing minor [[Software feature|features]]. Bounty driven development is one of the [[Business models for open-source software]]. The compensation offered for an open-source bounty is usually small.

==Alternatives==
When open-source projects require bigger funds they usually apply for [[grants]] or, most recently, launch [[crowdsourcing]] or [[crowdfunding]] campaigns, typically organized over platforms like [[Kickstarter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/open-source-gets-its-own-crowd-funding-site-bounties-included|title=Open source gets its own crowd-funding site, with bounties included - BountyC is the crowd-funding site the open source community has been waiting for. |first=Bryan |last=Lunduke |date=2013-08-07|accessdate=2013-08-10 |quote=''Many open source projects (from phones to programming tools) have taken to crowd-funding sites (such as Kickstarter and indiegogo) in order to raise the cash needed for large-scale development.

The '''People's Summit''' was an annual conference in [[Chicago]] held by a group of progressive political organizations in the United States.

==People's Summit 2016==

Held in June 2016, the first People's Summit was set against the backdrop of the [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016]].  The conference was led by [[National Nurses United]] and [[The People for Bernie Sanders]]. Other groups involved in organizing the conference included [[Democratic Socialists of America]], [[Food &amp; Water Watch]], [[Our Revolution]] (previously the [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016]]), People Demanding Action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.peopledemandingaction.org/|title=People Demanding Action|website=www.peopledemandingaction.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; People's Action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://peoplesaction.org/|title=People's Action|website=People's Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Progressive Democrats of America]], Reclaim Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reclaimchicago.org/|title=Reclaim Chicago - Reclaiming Chicago, Cook County and Illinois Government from Corporations and the 1%|website=www.reclaimchicago.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America]], [[United Students Against Sweatshops]], Million Hoodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millionhoodies.net|title=Home|website=Million Hoodies Movement for Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[African-Americans for Bernie Sanders]].

The organizers of the Summit stated that they wanted to harness the energy of the Sanders campaign.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://www.thenation.com/article/there-was-no-clear-agenda-at-the-peoples-summit-and-thats-a-good-thing/ "There Was No Clear Agenda at the People's Summit - and That's a Good Thing"], "The Nation", June 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Over 3,000 people attended the 2016 People's Summit to hear speakers including [[Rosario Dawson]], [[Tulsi Gabbard]], [[Gaby Hoffmann]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Jesus "Chuy" Garcia]], and [[Frances Fox Piven]]. The most cited speech was by [[Nina Turner]], a Sanders surrogate and member of the [[Ohio State Senate]], with the rousing line: "We need folks elected to office who actually give a shit about the people they represent!".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-political-convention-where-bernies-revolution-reigns-20160622 "The Political Convention Where Bernie's Revolution Reigns"], "Rolling Stone", June 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/19/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-peoples-summit/ "Why Trump's not on the agenda at 'People's Summit'"], "CNN", June 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage of the 2016 Summit focused on different themes, with [[Rolling Stone]] calling the event a "coming out party for a new kind of politics" and "the kindling for democratic socialism with teeth." [[The New York Times]] focused on the split among attendees between Bernie supporters who would support [[Hillary Clinton]] during the general election, and those who would not - known as 'Bernie or Bust'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/20/us/politics/bernie-sanders-supporters-hillary-clinton-progressives.html "Bernie Sanders Die-Hards Gather and Try to Look Past November"], "The New York Times", June 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The correspondent from [[The Nation]] remarked on how organized the Summit was compared to similar left-wing political events.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==People's Summit 2017==

The second Peoples Summit was held June 9–11, 2017 at [[McCormick Place]]. The conference was sponsored by  People for Bernie, National Nurses United, Our Revolution, and others.  The theme for the 2017 summit was "Beyond Resistance: A People’s Movement for a Just World".  
[[Bernie Sanders]] headlined the conference, along with [[RoseAnn DeMoro]], [[Naomi Klein]], [[Nina Turner]], [[Michael Moore]], [[Linda Sarsour]], [[Christine Pellegrino]],  [[Larry Krasner]], [[Chokwe Antar Lumumba]], and others.  The conference was attended by over 4,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/28/politics/bernie-sanders-peoples-summit/ "Sanders to headline progressive 'People's Summit'"] "CNN", March 28, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weigel|first1=David|title=Other lessons from the People’s Summit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/06/12/other-lessons-from-the-peoples-summit/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Idelson|first1=Charles|title=Sen.

Sanders delivered the keynote speech calling for an agenda "that can enhance and expand issue campaigns and hold all elected officials accountable to popular demands for justice, equality, and freedom." During his speech, he repeatedly criticized the Democratic Party, calling it an "absolute failure" and blaming it for the election of President Trump.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Common Dreams staff|title=The People's Summit: LIVE from Chicago|url=https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/06/10/peoples-summit-live-chicago|website=Common Dreams|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; I’m often asked by the media and others: How did it come about that Donald Trump, the most unpopular presidential candidate in the modern history of our country, won the election? And my answer is—and my answer is that Trump didn’t win the election; the Democratic Party lost the election. Let us—let us be very, very clear: The current model—the current model and the current strategy of the Democratic Party is an absolute failure. This is not—this is not my opinion. This is the facts. You know, we focus a lot on the presidential election, but we also have to understand that Democrats have lost the U.S. House, the U.S. Senate. Republicans now control almost two-thirds of the governors’ chairs throughout the country. And over the last nine years, Democrats have lost almost 1,000 legislative seats in states all across this country. Today—today, in almost half of the states in America, Democratic Party has almost no political presence at all. Now, if that’s not a failure, if that’s not a failed model, I don’t know what a failed model is.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conference appeared to strive to pass the leadership role from Bernie Sanders to a whole new generation of candidates.  When Sanders spoke and the crowd began to chant the familiar “Bernie! Bernie!,”  he shouted back, “It's not Bernie. “It's you. It's us.”

Several speakers  stressed that future generations need protection as well.  Nina Turner's speech drew boisterous  approval  from the attendees. She said, "You've got to walk the walk...you have to care more about the next generation than the next election.”  Mike Sylvester, a union organizer for 20 years who ran a successful campaign as a socialist for the Maine House of Representatives in 2016, said that as he went door-to-door campaigning for long hours, he would remind himself that he was running for office for the future of his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwenk|first1=David|title=People's Summit Vows to Transform Resistance into Power|url=https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/06/12/peoples-summit-vows-transform-resistance-power|website=Common Dreams|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kimono]] that carried designs depicting scenes from contemporary life became popular in [[Japan]] between 1900 and 1945.

Among the factors that led to the emergence of omoshirogara/propaganda kimonos, three stand out: the introduction of modern textile manufacturing and printing equipment into Japan in the late 19th century allowed textile manufacturers to produce printable apparel fabric more quickly and cheaply;&lt;ref name="Deacon and Calvin, 2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deacon|first1=Deborah A.|last2=Calvin|first2=Paula E.|title=War Imagery in Women's Textiles : A worldwide study of weaving, knitting, sewing, quilting, rug making and other fabric arts|date=2014|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC|isbn=0786474661|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6fgAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA226&amp;ots=6dm0y5fkFX&amp;dq=%22Hiroshi%20Kashiwagi%22%20AND%20Kimonos&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hiroshi%20Kashiwagi%22%20AND%20Kimonos&amp;f=false|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the social and political impetus for Japan to modernize;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Kendall H. et al.|title=Taishō chic: Japanese modernity, nostalgia and deco : [exhibition, Honolulu academy of arts, January 31 to March 15, 2002]|date=2002|publisher=Honolulu academy of arts|location=Honolulu (T.

By the later 1920s and especially following the [[Crash of 1929|crash in 1929]] (and Japan's economically disastrous return to [[the gold standard]]), conservative and ultra-nationalist forces in the military and government elites began to push back against the modernist trends and reasserted more traditional values.&lt;ref name="Gordon, 2009 -Depression and Crisis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Andrew|title=A modern history of Japan: from Tokugawa times to the present|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533922-2|pages=181–195|edition=2nd|url=https://www.amazon.com/Modern-History-Japan-Tokugawa-Present/dp/0195339223/ref=pd_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=M3WB1SJHHXGMKWVXVS0A|chapter=The Depression Crisis and Responses|quote=...this move brought disaster.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military power, the will to use it, and the ability to manufacture its hardware became ever more central to Japan’s self-image.

The '''Public Dance Halls Act 1935''' ({{lang-ga|Acht Um Hallai Rinnce Puibli, 1935}}) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Oireachtas]] which regulates [[dance hall]]s in Ireland by introducing a licensing system and a tax on admission tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dance Theatre in Ireland: Revolutionary Moves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2EbCeH5DWQIC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=7 December 2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-03547-9|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The proposals were based on the recommendations of the 1932 report of the Carrigan Commission into [[juvenile sex crimes]].&lt;ref name="history707"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/707|title=Review of 'Ireland’s Magdalen Laundries and the Nation’s Architecture of Containment'|last=Murphy|first=Paula|date=December 2008|work=Reviews in History|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Carrigan Report recommendations were enacted in the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, which raised the [[age of consent]] and banned artificial [[contraception]].&lt;ref name="history707" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1935/en/act/pub/0006/index.html|title=Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On dance halls, the report stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In the course of the Inquiry no form of abuse was blamed more persistently for pernicious consequences than the unlicensed dances held all over the country in unsuitable buildings and surroundings, for the profit of persons who are liable to no control or supervision by any authority. The scandals that are the outcome of such a situation are notorious. They have been denounced in [[Pastoral letter|pastoral]]s, exposed in the Press, and condemned by clergy, judges and justices, without avail. Before us the Commissioner, speaking for the [[Garda Síochána|Civic Guard]], said these dance gatherings in many districts were turned into "orgies of dissipation, which in the present state of legislation the police are powerless to prevent." In short, there is no effective legislation to put down this nuisance.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Public Dance Halls Bill was introduced in 1934 by the [[Government of the 8th Dáil|then government]] of [[Fianna Fáil]], and supported by the opposition [[Fine Gael]] and [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail1934062800016?opendocument|title=In Committee on Finance. - Public Dance Halls Bill, 1934—Second Stage.|date=28 June 1934|work=Dáil Éireann debates|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was supported by [[Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference|the Catholic hierarchy]]. Secular nationalist institutions like the [[Gaelic League]] the legislation were seen as beneficial for protecting Irish culture against foreign influence.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Gedutis|title=See You at the Hall: Boston's Golden Era of Irish Music And Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtO3jbQ1YZ0C&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=1 July 2005|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-640-4|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural effect==
Licensing is administered at the [[District Court (Ireland)|district court]], subject to the discretion of the local judge. In the early years of its effect, they were less tolerant of more recently introduced musical styles, such as [[set dancing]] (seen as "foreign") and [[1930s in jazz|jazz]] dance clubs.&lt;ref name="Roche2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Roche|title=The Cambridge Companion to Brian Friel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jexvtdc88PMC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=28 April 2013|date=19 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-82767-6|pages=85–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Stokes|author2=Philip V.

This set the conditions for the predominance of the [[céilidh]], with its large and loud musical ensembles and wide open dance spaces.&lt;ref name="Gedutis2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vallely1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fintan Vallely|title=The Companion to Irish Traditional Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xN1VS6sWsEC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=28 April 2013|year=1999|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-8802-8|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ceilidh]] arose at the expense of older traditional music, which declined in popularity for decades until the creation of the [[Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann]], and later the [[Folk Revival]] brought new attention to traditional Irish music.&lt;ref name="StokesBohlman2003"/&gt;

==Current status==
The Act remains in force, with amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/isbc/1935.html#a2_1935|title=Legislation directory: Public Dance Halls Act, 1935 |work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nightclub]]s may be subject to stricter conditions in some districts than in others, depending on the particular judge.

The '''Purple March''' was an anti-[[apartheid]] protest held in [[Cape Town]] on 2 September 1989, four days before [[South Africa]]'s racially segregated parliament held its [[South African general election, 1989|elections]].  A police water cannon with purple dye was turned on thousands of [[Mass Democratic Movement]] supporters who poured into the city in an attempt to march on South Africa's Parliament. White office blocks adjacent to [[Greenmarket Square]] were sprayed purple four stories high as a protester leapt onto the roof of the [[water cannon]] vehicle, seized the nozzle and attempted to turn the jet away from the crowds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"&gt;Weekend Argus, "Purple Rain halts city demo", front page, Saturday, 2 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the dyed buildings was the Cape Headquarters of the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]]. The historic Town House, a national monument (now known as a [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage site]]), was sprayed purple and the force of the jet smashed windows in the Central Methodist Church.

[[Tear gas]] was fired and the crowd that had knelt defiantly in the purple jet fled. Adderley Street was closed to traffic as scores of shops and businesses closed their doors and hundreds of people were arrested, including Dr [[Allan Boesak]], [[University of Cape Town|UCT]] academic Dr Charles Villa-Vicencio, Western Cape Council of Churches official Rev. Pierre van den Heever and lawyer Essa Moosa.

==Climax==
The police were using a new water cannon with purple dye whose purpose was to stain protestors for later identification and [[arrest]].&lt;ref name=Leibenluft&gt;{{cite web

When the cannon was turned on them, some protestors remained kneeling while others fled; some had their feet knocked out from under them by the force of the jet. In Adderley Street, shoppers ran for cover, their eyes streaming, and a young couple with a baby in a pram were hurriedly ushered into a shop which then locked its doors.

A lone protestor, Philip Ivey,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://Www.sthp.saha.org.za/memorial/the_purple_shall_govern.htm|title = The Sunday Times Heritage Project|date = |accessdate = 28 December 2015|website = South African History Archive|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; redirected the water cannon toward the local headquarters of the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sthp.saha.org.za/memorial/articles/the_day_the_purple_governed.htm|title = SAHA / Sunday Times Heritage Project - Memorials|website = sthp.saha.org.za|access-date = 2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters, along with the historic, white-painted [[Old Town House (Cape Town)|Old Town House]], overlooking [[Greenmarket Square]], were doused with purple dye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=57gyw36xwk8C|title=Every Step of the Way: The Journey to Freedom in South Africa|author1=Michael Morris |author2=John Linnegar |location=South Africa|publisher=HSRC Press|year=2004|isbn=0-7969-2061-3|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of about 50 protesters streaming with purple dye, ran from Burg Street, down to the parade. They were followed by another group of clergymen and others who were stopped in Plein Street. Some were then arrested. On the Parade, a large contingent of policemen arrested everyone they could find who had purple dye on them. When they were booed by the crowd, police dispersed them. About 250 people marching under a banner stating "The People Shall Govern" dispersed at the intersection of Darling Street and Sir Lowry Road after being stopped by police.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1989"/&gt;

==Graffiti==
After the riot, somebody sprayed graffiti that would make it into the history books. The [[Cape Times]] told it this way:{{Cite quote|date=March 2010}}

{{quote|Graffiti artists at the weekend sprayed several Cape Town suburban railway stations with slogans reading: Release our leaders, Free our leaders, unban the ANC and Forward to purple people's power, -- a reference to the police use of purple dye in the water cannon directed against demonstrators....}}

Another piece of anti-apartheid graffiti, "'''The purple shall govern'''", appeared on the old Townhouse in Greenmarket Square.  The statement is play on words of the [[Freedom Charter]]'s declaration that "The people shall govern".

The slogan was used as the title of a book, "The Purple shall govern: a South African A to Z of nonviolent action".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlQxAAAAIAAJ|author1=Dene Smuts |author2=Shauna Westcott |author3=Margaret Nash |publisher=Oxford University Press, Centre for Intergroup Studies|year=1991|title=The Purple Shall Govern: a South African A to Z of Nonviolent Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comments==
"What about the purple people?" a reader asked the Cape Times' Teleletters. "Not only has the government messed up with the [[Tricameral Parliament|tricameral system]], now their police have created another problem. They, the government, have made 'provision' for the so-called coloureds and Indians -- how are they going to accommodate the 'purple people? Perhaps the next time they use their water cannon, they would like to consult with their voters as to which colour is fashionable." &lt;ref&gt;New House for purple people?, Cape Times, 5 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

"Who's going to pay for the city's day of purple spray?" asked Don Holliday of the [[Cape Argus]]. "As the controversy continues over who is to pay for the clean-up of buildings, streets, cars and clothing sprayed purple by police during Saturday's Mass Democratic Movement's attempted march to parliament, police announced that they would release details of the effects of the dye." &lt;ref&gt;The [[Cape Argus]], font page, Tuesday 5 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

"A spokesperson for the police directorate of public relations said they had approached their forensic science division to prepare a report on the effects of the dye -- including whether it would eventually wash off and possible solutions for washing."

A later statement reported that the dye was a "harmless substance" which was mixed with water and could be washed off clothing with soap and water. Walls sprayed with the dye could be cleaned using a mixture of one part hydrochloric acid to 100 parts water and then rinsed.

The Rev. Herbert Brand of the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa|Dutch Reformed Church]] was inspired by the "purple drama" as well as the 50th anniversary of the start of WW2 to deliver a passionate sermon on "fascism in the city".&lt;ref&gt;Cape Times, Tuesday, 5 September 1989, pg9&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 February 2017, Koh was abducted by a group of men in Petaling Jaya while on his way to a friend's house.

{{Refimprove|date=February 2012}}
The '''Revisionist Western''' or '''Anti-Western''' is a [[genre|subgenre]] of the [[Western (genre)|Western]] film that traces its roots to the mid-[[1960s in film|1960s]] and early-[[1970s in film|1970s]].

Some post-[[World War II|WWII]] Western films began to question the ideals and style of the traditional Western. These films placed the context of the Native Americans and the Cowboys alike in a darker setting. They depicted a morally questionable world where the heroes and villains often times resembled each other more closely than had ever previously been shown. The concept of right and wrong became blurred in a world where actions could no longer be said to be good or bad. Whereas in a majority of the classical western films the ethics were clear and defined in 'black and white', the Revisionist film looked to paint a moral 'grey' area where people had to adapt in order to survive. This led to depictions of outlaws such as ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'' where the heroes of the film are outlaw bank robbers.

==Hollywood revisionist Westerns==
{{refimprove section|date = July 2016}}
Most Westerns from the 1960s to the present have revisionist themes. Many were made by emerging major filmmakers who saw the Western as an opportunity to expand their criticism of [[Culture of the United States|American society and values]] into a new genre.  The 1952 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] holding in ''[[Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson]]'', and later, the end of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]] in 1968 broadened what Westerns could portray and made the revisionist Western a more viable genre. Films in this category include [[Sam Peckinpah|Sam Peckinpah's]] ''[[Ride the High Country]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]) and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), [[Arthur Penn]]'s ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' ([[1970 in film|1970]]) and [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]).

Beginning in the late 1960s, independent filmmakers produced revisionist and [[hallucinogen]]ic films, later retroactively identified as the separate but related subgenre of "[[Acid Western]]s", that radically turn the usual trappings of the Western genre inside out to critique both [[capitalism]] and the [[counterculture]]. [[Monte Hellman]]'s ''[[The Shooting]]'' and ''[[Ride in the Whirlwind]]'' (1966), [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]]'s ''[[El Topo (1970 film)|El Topo]]'' ([[1970 in film|1970]]), [[Robert Downey Sr.]]'s ''[[Greaser's Palace]]'' ([[1972 in film|1972]]), [[Alex Cox]]'s [[Walker (film)|''Walker'']] ([[1987 in film|1987]]), and [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Dead Man]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]]) fall into this category.&lt;ref name="Cineaste"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jonathanrosenbaum.net/1996/04/a-gun-up-your-ass-an-interview-with-jim-jarmusch-tk/ |title=A Gun Up Your Ass: An Interview with Jim Jarmusch |work=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |volume=22 |number=2|date=Spring 1996 |first=Jonathan |last=Rosenbaum |authorlink=Jonathan Rosenbaum |accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films made during the early 1970s are particularly noted for their hyper-realistic photography and production design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.philipbrophy.com/projects/rstff/RewrittenWesterns_C.html |title=Rewritten Westerns: Rewired Westerns |last=Brophy |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Brophy |work=Stuffing |number=1 |year=1987 |location=[[Melbourne]] |accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples using sepia tinting and muddy rustic settings are ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[McCabe and Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971) and ''[[The Culpepper Cattle Co.]]'' (1972).

Other films, such as those directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], were made by professionals familiar with the Western as a criticism and expansion against and beyond the genre. [[Clint Eastwood|Eastwood's]] film ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' ([[1976 in film|1976]]) made use of strong supporting roles for women and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s. The films ''[[The Long Riders]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]) and ''[[The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]) are revisionist films dealing with the [[Jesse James|James gang]]. Jeffrey Wright's portrayal of Black Confederate Daniel Holt riding with the Missouri Bushwhackers in ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'' tells the stories of the [[Missouri-Kansas Border War]] and [[Lawrence Massacre]]. ''[[Unforgiven]]'' ([[1992 in film|1992]]), which Eastwood directed from an original screenplay by [[David Webb Peoples]], dramatically criticized the typical Western use of violence to promote false ideals of manhood and to subjugate women and [[minority group|minorities]].

==Spaghetti Westerns==
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:OUATITW-1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', in true [[Sergio Leone]] style, ends with an extended shootout scene between Harmonica ([[Charles Bronson]]) and Frank ([[Henry Fonda]]). The film is a critique of the [[American Dream]] and Western mythology]] --&gt;
{{Main|Spaghetti Western}}

Foreign markets, which had imported the Western since their [[silent film]] inception, began creating their own Westerns early on. However, a unique brand of Western emerged in [[Europe]] in the 1960s as an offshoot of the Revisionist Western.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The [[Spaghetti Western]] became the nickname, originally disparagingly, for this broad subgenre, so named because of their common [[Italy|Italian]] background, directing, producing and financing (with occasional [[Spain|Spanish]] involvement). Originally they had in common the [[Italian language]], low budgets, and a recognizable highly fluid, violent, minimalist [[cinematography]] that helped eschew (some said "de-mythologize") many of the conventions of earlier Westerns. They were often made in [[Spain]], especially [[Andalusia]], the dry ruggedness of which resembled the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]]'s. Director [[Sergio Leone]] played a seminal role in this movement. A subtle theme of the conflict between Anglo and Hispanic cultures plays through all these movies. Leone conceived of the Old West as a dirty place filled with morally ambivalent figures, and this aspect of the spaghetti Western came to be one of its universal attributes, as seen in a wide variety of these films, beginning with one of the first popular spaghetti Westerns, ''[[Gunfight at Red Sands]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), and visible elsewhere in those starring John Philip Law (''[[Death Rides a Horse]]'') or [[Franco Nero]], and in the ''[[They Call Me Trinity|Trinity]]'' series.

==Red Western==
{{Main|Ostern}}
{{See also|Gibanica Western}}

The [[Ostern]], or red Western, was the [[Soviet Bloc]]'s reply to the Western, and arose in the same period as the revisionist Western. While many red Westerns concentrated on aspects of Soviet/Eastern-European history, some others like the Czech ''[[Lemonade Joe]]'' (1964) and the East German ''[[The Sons of the Great Mother Bear]]'' (1966) tried to demythologise the Western in different ways: ''Lemonade Joe'' by sending up the more ridiculous aspects of marketing, and ''The Sons of the Great Mother Bear'' by showing how American natives were exploited repeatedly, told from the Native American rather than white settler viewpoint.

''[[A Man from the Boulevard des Capucines]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]) was a sensitive [[satire]] on the Western film itself. It was also highly unusual in being one of the few examples in Soviet film of [[post-modernism]].

'''SCISYS PLC''' is a [[Europe|pan-European]] computer software and services company based in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]].

==Overview==
SCISYS is a medium-sized software and IT services company. The AIM-listed company (Lon:SSY) is a leading developer of information and communications technology services, e-business, web and mobile applications, editorial newsroom solutions and advanced technology solutions. The SCISYS Group comprises SCISYS UK Ltd, SCISYS Deutschland GmbH, ANNOVA Systems GmbH and Xibis Ltd.

==History==
SCISYS was formed in 1980 as '''Science Systems''' and its shares were listed on London's  [[Alternative Investment Market]] in 1997.

In 2000, Science Systems acquired [[CODA (company)|CODA]], an accounting software company, and in 2002 the group holding company was renamed '''CODASciSys plc'''. The CODA business was demerged as a separately listed company in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Science Systems press release, March 30, 2000 ''[http://www.coda.com/Art?AID=79 Science Systems Confirms CODA Acquisition]''. Retrieved on August 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, James. ''"CODASciSys."'' [[Sunday Telegraph]] (London, England) (Sept 24, 2006) [http://find.galegroup.com/itx/start.do?prodId=SPN.SP00 Newspapers Online. Gale.] Retrieved on March 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the demerger the original, remaining business became SciSys plc in 2006.

In 2007, SciSys purchased a private [[Bochum]]-based German company, VCS AG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcs.de/index.php?id=545&amp;L=1|title=New owner of VCS AG|accessdate=2008-04-15|date=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  VCS produced software, computer systems and telecommunications systems for [[broadcasting]], and services for public- and private-sector [[satellite]]s.

In January 2012 the VCS business was renamed SCISYS Deutschland GmbH as part of a wider integration exercise. As part of this, in May 2012, the UK operations of SciSys were also rebranded as SCISYS. These two changes brought the business divisions together, operating under the same name and branding.

In October 2012, SCISYS purchased the space-market elements of the German company MakaluMedia.

In December 2014, SCISYS announced the acquisition of Xibis Limited,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iii.co.uk/stockmarketwire/211721/scisys-acquires-xibis|title=Acquisition of web and mobile application development company Xibis Limited|last=|first=|date=|work=iii|access-date=2017-08-15|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mobile and web-development firm.

In November 2016, SCISYS announced the acquisition of ANNOVA Systems GmbH &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/SSY/13045011.html|title=Acquisition of ANNOVA Systems GmbH - RNS - London Stock Exchange|website=www.londonstockexchange.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; a leading provider of software solutions for media and broadcast, in particular its OpenMedia [[newsroom]] computer systems.

In May 2017, SCISYS announced that the Media &amp; Broadcast division of SCISYS Deutschland has moved from Bochum to new offices in nearby Dortmund. The Bochum location remains the German headquarters and the home of its space division.

{{Politics of Malaysia}}
{{Discrimination sidebar}}
The '''social contract''' in [[Malaysia]] refers to the supposedly understanding made by Malaya's founding fathers in the [[Constitution of Malaya|Constitution]], nearing its independence. The social contract usually refers to a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' trade-off through Articles 14–18 of the Constitution, pertaining to the granting of citizenship to the non-Bumiputera of Malaya (particularly Malaysian Chinese and Indian), and this was carried over to [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153]] when Malaysia was formed on 16 September 1963, which grants the Malays special position in the country.  The term has also been used occasionally to refer to other portions of the Constitution. This circumstance does not apply in Sarawak as all racial groups were citizens, bestowed by the legitimate Brooke government, way before the founding of Malaysia. 

In its typical context related to [[race relations]], the social contract has been heavily criticised by many, including politicians from the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition, who contend that constant harping on the non-Malays' debt to the Malays for citizenship has alienated them from the country. Such criticisms have met with opposition from the Malay media and the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the largest political party in Barisan Nasional.

==William Reid report==
{{main|s:Report of the Federation of Malaya Constitutional Commission, 1957}}
On 22 October 2010, Malaysian exiled popular blogger RPK ([[Raja Petra Kamarudin]]) revealed page by page of the 33-page document (a report by Lord Reid in year 1956 to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]) which he retrieved from the archiving library in England. RPK claimed that the Malaysian government has since distorted the content of Lord Reid's report into what is called the 'Social Contract of Malaysia'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malaysia-today.net/mtcolumns/no-holds-barred/35421-you-want-to-know-about-the-social-contract-okay-lets-study-history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contractual terms==
The Constitution does not explicitly refer to a "social contract" (in terms of citizenship rights and privileges), and no act of law or document has ever fully set out the social contract's terms. Its defenders often refer to the Constitution as setting out the social contract, and the Malaysian founding fathers having agreed to it, although no reference to a "social contract" appears in the Constitution. Instead, the social contract is typically taken to mean a ''quid pro quo'' agreement that provides the non-Malay and other non-indigenous peoples of Malaysia (mostly the [[Malaysian Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indian]]) with citizenship, in return for recognising the special position of the Malays and indigenous people of Malaysia, collectively referred to as the [[Bumiputra]] (sons of the soil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=7540|title=Keng Yaik against racial 'bullying'|last=Chow|first=Kum Hor|work=The Straits Times|date=25 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A higher education Malaysian studies textbook conforming to the government syllabus states: "Since the Malay leaders agreed to relax the conditions for citizenship, the leaders of the Chinese and Indian communities accepted the special position of the Malays as indigenous people of Malaya. With the establishment of Malaysia, the special position status was extended to include the indigenous communities of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]."&lt;ref&gt;Shuid, Mahdi &amp; Yunus, Mohd. Fauzi (2001). ''Malaysian Studies'', p. 50. Longman. {{ISBN|983-74-2024-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another description of the social contract declares it to be an agreement that "Malay entitlement to political and administrative authority should be accepted unchallenged, at least for the time being, in return for non-interference in Chinese control of the economy".&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah, Asma &amp; Pedersen, Paul B. (2003). ''Understanding Multicultural Malaysia'', p. 59. Pearson Malaysia. {{ISBN|983-2639-21-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution explicitly grants the Bumiputra reservations of land, quotas in the civil service, [[scholarship|public scholarships]] and [[public education]], quotas for trade licences, and the permission to monopolise certain industries if the government permits. In reality, however, especially after the advent of the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] (NEP) due to the racial riots of the [[May 13 Incident]] which occurred in 1969 when Malays held only 4% of the Malaysian economy, Bumiputra privileges have extended to other areas; quotas are set for Bumiputra equity in publicly traded corporations, and discounts for them on [[automobile]]s and real estate ranging from 5% to 15% are mandated.

The Constitution also included elements of Malay tradition as part of the Malaysian national identity. The [[Malay rulers]] were preserved, with the head of state, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], drawn from their ranks. [[Islam]] would be the national religion, and the [[Malay language]] would be the national language. These provisions, along with the economic privileges accorded by [[Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia|Article 153 of the Constitution]], made up one half of the bargain, and have been referred to as the [[Malay Agenda]]. The nature of these provisions is disputed; although many Malays refer to them as "rights" – a term common in UMNO rhetoric – critics have argued that the Constitution never refers to special rights for the Malays:

{{quote|There is no such thing as a racial "right" to be given special treatment. And that is not me being argumentative, it's the Constitution. You won't find "Malay rights" in the supreme law of our land, instead, you will find terms such as "special position" of Malays. The difference is more than semantics. A right implies something inalienable. A privilege on the other hand is a benefit, presumably given to those who need it.}}

Such critics have used this basis to argue that the social contract was meant "to protect the Malays from being overwhelmed economically, administratively and politically from the immigrant ethnic groups of the time", instead of granting particular special rights to the Malays.&lt;ref&gt;Sharom, Azmi (28 November 2006). [http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=1015 Fear-mongers drown out genuine issues]. ''Malaysia Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that this bias towards Malays in education and politics is, in part, a response to the ability of the Malaysian Chinese to secure most of the country's wealth. The Indian Malaysians, as with the Indian Singaporeans, can make a case for being those that lose out the most, although this may be disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Sentinel (26 November 2007). [http://www.asiasentinel.com/politics/indian-discontent-in-malaysia/]. ''Indian Discontent in Malaysia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government did roll back the quota system for entry to public universities in 2003 and introduced a policy of "[[meritocracy]]". However, this new system was widely criticised by the non-Bumiputras as benefiting the Bumiputras by streaming them into a matriculation programme that featured relatively easy coursework while the non-Bumiputras were forced to sit for the [[Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia]] (STPM, or Malaysia Higher School Certificate). Although in theory non-Bumiputras may enter the matriculation stream, and Bumiputras may sit for the STPM, this rarely occurs in reality. Meritocracy was also criticised by some quarters in UMNO as being discriminatory, as it caused the rural and less-prepared Malays to fall behind in university entrance rates.

The [[Reid Commission]] which prepared the framework for the Constitution stated in its report that Article 153, the backbone of the social contract, would be temporary only, and recommended that it be reviewed 15&amp;nbsp;years after independence. The Commission also said that the article and its provisions would only be necessary to avoid sudden unfair disadvantage to the Malays in competing with other members of Malaysian society, and that the privileges accorded the Malays by the article should be gradually reduced and eventually eliminated. Due to the 13 May Incident, after which a state of emergency was declared, however, 1972, the year that Article 153 was due to be reviewed, passed without incident.

According to the social contract's proponents, in return for the enactment of these originally temporary provisions, non-Malay Malaysians are accorded citizenship under Chapter 1 of Part III of the Constitution. Except for the Bumiputra privileges, non-Bumiputras are otherwise generally regarded as equal to their Bumiputra counterparts, and are accorded all the rights of citizenship as under Part II of the Constitution. In recent years, some have sought to provide Malay citizens with more political rights as per the ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]'' philosophy. However, most of these ''ketuanan Melayu'' proponents argue that their additional rights are already written as law and thus only seek to "defend" them from their opponents.

When he assumed the Presidency of UMNO, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] (later the first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]]) stated that ''"...when we (the Malays) fought against the [[Malayan Union]] (which upset the position of the Malays' rights) the others took no part in it because they said this is purely a Malay concern, and not theirs. They also indicate that they owe their loyalty to their countries of origin, and for that reason they oppose the [[Barnes Report]] to make [[Malay language|Malay]] the national language. If we were to hand over the Malays to these so-called Malayans when their nationality has not been defined there will be a lot of problems ahead of us."'' However, he continued that ''"For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will have the same rights and privileges as the Malays."''&lt;ref&gt;Putra, Tunku Abdul Rahman (1986). ''Political Awakening'', p. 31. Pelanduk Publications. {{ISBN|967-978-135-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early criticism==
Article 153, and thus by extension the social contract, has been a source of controversy since the early days of Malaysia. Singaporean politician [[Lee Kuan Yew]] of the [[People's Action Party|PAP]] publicly questioned the need for Article 153 in [[Parliament of Malaysia|Parliament]], and called for a "[[Malaysian Malaysia]]" pointing out that if Dato' [[Syed Ja'afar Albar]], an UMNO stalwart who came to Malaya from [[Indonesia]] just before the war at the age of more than thirty, could claim to be Malaysian then so should those non-Malays whose families had been born and bred in Malaysia for generations. "Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour."&lt;ref&gt;Ye, Lin-Sheng (2003). ''The Chinese Dilemma'', p. 43. East West Publishing. {{ISBN|0-9751646-1-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee criticised the government's policies by stating that "[t]hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens to go up to the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Kuan Yew (2000). ''The Singapore Story'', Abridged edition, pp. 327–328. Federal Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; He also lamented, "Malaysia – to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, sitting in this chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian."

Lee's statements upset many, especially politicians from the Alliance, Barisan Nasional's predecessor. Then Finance Minister [[Tan Siew Sin]] of the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA) called Lee the "greatest, disruptive force in the entire history of Malaysia and Malaya." [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the first [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], considered Lee to be too extremist in his views, while other UMNO politicians thought Lee was simply taking advantage of the situation to pander to the Malaysian Chinese.

[[PAP-UMNO relations]] were chilled further by the PAP running several candidates in elections on the [[Malay peninsula]], with UMNO retaliating by trying to run candidates on its ticket in Singapore. Eventually, the Tunku decided to kick Singapore out of Malaysia. Lee was sincerely saddened by this and shed tears in an emotional interview on national television as Singapore became an independent nation in 1965. The [[Constitution of Singapore]] contains an article, Article 152, that names the Malays as "indigenous people" of Singapore and therefore requiring special safeguarding of their rights and privileges as such. However, the article specifies no policies for such safeguarding, and no reference to a "social contract" has ever been made by the PAP government in Singapore.

==Present debate==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Hisham Keris.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Hishamuddin Hussein]] threatened the non-Malays not to question the social contract, ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]'' or "Malay rights" at the UMNO Annual General Meeting in 2005.]] --&gt;

In 2005, the social contract was brought up by [[Lim Keng Yaik]] of the [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]] party in Barisan Nasional. Lim, a Minister in the government, asked for a re-examination of the social contract so that a "[[Bangsa Malaysia]]" (literally [[Malay language|Malay]] for a Malaysian race or Malaysian nation) could be achieved. Lim was severely criticised by many Malay politicians, including [[Khairy Jamaluddin]] who is Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s son-in-law and Deputy Chairman of the UMNO Youth wing, and [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek]], a prominent Malay Member of Parliament from the state of [[Terengganu]]. The Malay press (most of which is owned by UMNO) also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim was adamant, asking in an interview "How do you expect non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this? Flag-waving and singing the [[Negaraku]] (the national anthem) are rituals, while true love for the nation lies in the heart."

A year earlier, Abdullah had given a speech where he mentioned the most "significant aspect" of the social contract as "the agreement by the indigenous peoples to grant citizenship to the immigrant Chinese and Indians". However, Abdullah went on to state that "the character of the nation" changed to "one that Chinese and Indian citizens could also call their own". However, the speech went largely unremarked.

In the end, Lim stated that the Malay press had blown his comments out of proportion and misquoted him. The issue ended with UMNO Youth chief and Education Minister [[Hishamuddin Hussein]] warning people not to "bring up the issue again as it has been agreed upon, appreciated, understood and endorsed by the Constitution."

Earlier that year, Hishamuddin had brandished the ''[[keris]]'' (traditional Malay dagger) at the UMNO Annual General Meeting, warning non-Malays not to threaten "Malay rights" and to question the social contract. This was applauded by the UMNO delegates, but widely ridiculed in the Malaysian [[blogosphere]].

Other politicians, mostly from opposition parties, have also criticised the NEP and its provisions, but refrained from directly criticising the social contract or Article 153 of the Constitution. Former Deputy Prime Minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]] of the [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] (PKR) promised he would roll back the NEP if he ever gained power, and many from the [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) have also spoken out against the NEP. They criticised the NEP as benefiting only a small portion of Malays, mostly well-connected and urban, while ignoring the rural and poor Malays, and noted that the NEP's avowed goal was to give the Malays a 30% share in the country's economic equity, regardless of whether only a few or many Malays held this share. The DAP has been particular in arguing it does not question Article 153 or the social contract, but merely seeks to abolish inequitable policies such as the NEP.

Article 10 (4) of the Constitution permits the government to ban the questioning of Article 153, and thus the social contract; indeed, the Sedition Act does illegalise such questioning. The [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act]] (ISA) also permits the government to detain anybody it desires for practically an indefinite period of time, and many, including politicians from the DAP such as [[Lim Kit Siang]] and [[Karpal Singh]] have been held under the ISA; it is widely believed this was because of their vehement criticism of Malay privileges.

More recently, some commentators have remarked on younger Malaysians chafing at the terms of the social contract. One wrote that "half a century on, younger non-Malays especially feel they were not parties to deals and contracts (at the time of independence) and should not be beholden to them."&lt;ref&gt;Arifin, Zainul (15 November 2006). [http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=749 Umno could look out for others, too]. ''New Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, several non-Malay parties in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition called for a re-examination of the social contract; Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]]'s refusal to do so reportedly triggered "much consternation". Abdullah was quoted in the Malay media as saying: "If we change this balance and if we are forced to meet all over again on the rights of every group, it will not be the same as now. It would be far from satisfactory. Whatever the new formula, it will not succeed because the old formula is enough, is already maximum. As everyone had agreed to this before, why do we want to disturb this and meet again?"&lt;ref&gt;Bose, Romen (17 November 2006). [http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=788 Racial tensions on rise in Malaysia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004247/http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=788 |date=27 September 2007 }}. Al Jazeera.&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, at the UMNO General Assembly, several delegates criticised other members of the government coalition for criticising the social contract and ''[[ketuanan Melayu]]''. One stated that "If they question our rights, then we should question theirs. So far we have not heard the Malays questioning their right to citizenship when they came in droves from other countries."&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Reme (17 November 2006). [http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=793 Race tensions not worrying: Abdullah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014170939/http://malaysia-today.net/blog2006/newsncom.php?itemid=793 |date=14 October 2007 }}. ''Malaysia Today''.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued that the Bumiputra communities continued to lag behind the rest of the country economically, and called for stronger measures in line with the social contract.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Reme (17 November 2006).

''The Straits Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; One delegate, [[Hashim Suboh]], made headlines when he asked Hishammuddin, who had brandished the ''kris'' again, "[[Malay titles|Datuk]] Hisham has unsheathed his ''keris'', waved his ''keris'', kissed his ''keris''. We want to ask Datuk Hisham when is he going to use it?" Hashim said that "force must be used against those who refused to abide by the social contract", provoking criticism from the DAP, which accused him of [[sedition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/59757 'Hisham and his keris' remark shocks Karpal].

The '''Taiping Heavenly Kingdom''', officially the '''Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace''', was an oppositional state in [[China]] from 1851 to 1864, supporting the overthrow of the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty]] by [[Hong Xiuquan]] and [[God Worshippers|his followers]]. The unsuccessful war it waged against the Qing is known as the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Its capital was at [[Tianjing]] (present-day [[Nanjing]]).

A self-proclaimed convert to [[Christianity]], [[Hong Xiuquan]] led an army that controlled a significant part of [[southern China]] during the middle of the 19th century, eventually expanding to a size of nearly 30 million people. The rebel kingdom announced social reforms and the replacement of [[Confucianism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Chinese folk religion]] by [[God Worshipping|his form]] of [[Christianity]], holding that he was the second son of [[Christian God|God]] and the younger brother of [[Jesus]]. The Taiping areas were besieged by Qing forces throughout most of the rebellion. The Qing government defeated the rebellion with the eventual aid of [[Second French Empire|French]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces.

==Background==
{{Main article|Taiping rebellion#History}}
[[Image:Hong Xiuquan.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Hong Xiuquan]]
In the mid-19th century, China under the [[Qing dynasty]] suffered a series of natural disasters, economic problems, and defeats at the hands of the [[Western powers]]—in particular, the humiliating defeat in 1842 by the British in the [[First Opium War]]. The war disrupted shipping patterns and threw many out of work. It was these disaffected who flocked to join the charismatic visionary [[Hong Xiuquan]].

Beginning with [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Robert Morrison]] in 1807, [[Protestantism in China|Protestant]] [[Protestant missions in China|missionaries]] began working from [[Portuguese Macao|Macao]], [[Pazhou]] (known at the time as "Whampoa"), and [[Guangzhou]] ("Canton"). Their household staff and the printers they employed for [[Morrison's dictionary]] and [[Morrison's Bible|translation of the Bible]]—men like [[Cai Gao]], [[Liang Afa]], and [[Qu Ya'ang]]—were their first converts and suffered greatly, being repeatedly arrested, fined, and driven into exile at [[Dutch Malacca|Malacca]]. However, they corrected and adapted the missionaries' message to reach the Chinese, printing thousands of tracts of their own devising. Unlike the westerners, they were able to travel through the interior of the country and began to particularly frequent the [[prefecture (China)|prefectural]] and [[Guangdong|provincial]] [[imperial examination|examinations]], where local scholars competed for the chance to rise to power in the imperial civil service. One of the native tracts, Liang's nine-part, 500-page tome called ''[[Good Words to Admonish the Age]]'', found its way into the hands of [[Hong Xiuquan]] in the mid-1830s, although it remains a matter of debate during which exact examination this occurred. Hong initially leafed through it without interest.

After several failures during the examinations, however, Hong told friends and family of a dream in which he was greeted by a golden-haired, bearded man who presented him with a sword and a younger man whom he addressed as "Elder Brother". Hong worked in his village another six years as a tutor before his brother convinced him that Liang's tract was not like the others and was worth examination. When he read the tract he saw his long-past dream in terms of Christian symbolism: he was the younger brother of [[Jesus]] and had met [[God the Father]]. He now felt it was his duty to spread [[Christianity in China|Christianity]] and overthrow the Qing dynasty. He was joined by [[Yang Xiuqing]], a former charcoal and firewood salesman of [[Guangxi]], who claimed to act as a voice of God to direct the people and gain political power.{{sfnb|Spence|1990| p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=vI1RRslLNSwC&amp;dq=spence+search+for+modern+china&amp;q=Xiuquan+Elder+brother#v=snippet&amp;q=Xiuquan%20Elder%20brother&amp;f=false p. 171]}}

[[Feng Yunshan]] formed the Society of God Worshippers ({{zh|s={{linktext|拜|上帝|会}}|hp=Bài Shàngdì Huì|links=no}}), in [[Guangxi]] after a missionary journey there in 1844 to spread Hong's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/204254/Feng-Yunshan |title=Feng Yunshan (Chinese rebel leader) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1847, Hong became the leader of the secret society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/580815/Taiping-Rebellion |title=Taiping Rebellion (Chinese history) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taiping faith, inspired by missionary Christianity, says one historian, "developed into a dynamic new Chinese religion... Taiping Christianity". Hong presented this religion as a revival and a restoration of the ancient classical faith in [[Shangdi]], a faith that had been displaced by Confucianism and dynastic imperial regimes.{{sfnb|Reilly|2004 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XbrNq1sBVtMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Taiping%20Christianity&amp;f=false 4]}} The sect's power grew in the late 1840s, initially suppressing groups of bandits and pirates, but persecution by Qing authorities spurred the movement into a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla rebellion]] and then into [[civil war]].

==History==

===Establishment===
The [[Taiping Rebellion]] began in 1850 in [[Guangxi]].  On January 11, 1851 (the 11th day of the 1st lunar month), incidentally Hong Xiuquan's birthday, Hong declared himself "[[Tianwang|Heavenly King]]" of a new dynasty, the "Heavenly Kingdom of Great Peace".&lt;ref name="Fairbank2006"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=nBDC2cqb6I0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA206 China: A New History]'', John King Fairbank and Merle Goldman.  Harvard, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After minor clashes, the violence escalated into the [[Jintian Uprising]] in February 1851, in which a 10,000-strong rebel army routed and defeated a smaller Qing force.  Feng Yushan was to be the strategist of the rebellion and the administrator of the kingdom during its early days, until his death in 1852.&lt;ref name=son&gt;Spence (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1853 the Taiping forces captured [[Nanjing]], making it their capital and renaming it ''[[Tianjing]]'' ("Heavenly Capital"). Hong converted the office of the [[Viceroy of Liangjiang|Viceroy]] of [[Liangjiang New Area|Liangjiang]] into his [[Presidential Palace (Nanjing)|Palace of Heavenly King]]. Since Hong Xiuquan had been supposedly instructed in his dream to exterminate all "demons", which was what the Taipings considered the [[Manchus]] to be, thus they set out to kill and wipe out the entire Manchu population. When Nanjing was occupied, the Taipings went on a rampage killing, burning and hacking 40,000 Manchus to death in the city&lt;ref name="White2011"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthew White |author-link=Matthew White (historian) |title=Atrocities: The 100 Deadliest Episodes in Human History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-fQHlaIpR4C&amp;pg=PA289 |year=2011 |publisher=W. W. Norton |page=289 |isbn=978-0-393-08192-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first killed all the Manchu men, then forced the Manchu women outside the city and burnt them to death.{{sfnb|Reilly|2004| p= [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=wm4CuSvIYiEC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Kill+the+demons+manchus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DTNA4_c1Vm&amp;sig=qXEFebuaiwYrVurWrC6WlV2E9Lc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkw6Ws0PXPAhWLQ48KHcs4CgcQ6AEIHDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Kill%20the%20demons%20manchus&amp;f=false 139]}}

At its height, the Heavenly Kingdom controlled south China, centered on the fertile [[Yangtze River]] Valley. Control of the river meant that the Taiping could easily supply their capital. From there, the Taiping rebels sent armies west into the upper reaches of the Yangtze, and north to capture [[Beijing]], the capital of the Qing dynasty. The attempt to take Beijing failed.

===Internal conflict===
In 1853 Hong withdrew from active control of policies and administration, ruling exclusively by written proclamations often in religious language. Hong disagreed with Yang in certain matters of policy and became increasingly suspicious of Yang's ambitions, his extensive network of spies, and his declarations when "speaking as God". Yang and his family were put to death by Hong's followers in 1856, followed by the killing of troops loyal to Yang.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1996, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

With their leader largely out of the picture, Taiping delegates tried to widen their popular support with the Chinese middle classes and forge alliances with European powers, but failed on both counts. The Europeans decided to stay neutral. Inside China, the rebellion faced resistance from the traditionalist middle class because of their hostility to Chinese customs and [[Confucian]] values. The land-owning upper class, unsettled by the Taiping rebels' peasant mannerisms and their policy of strict separation of the sexes, even for married couples, sided with the Qing forces and their Western allies.

In 1859 [[Hong Rengan]], a cousin of Hong, joined the Taiping Rebellion in Nanjing, and was given considerable power by Hong. He developed an ambitious plan to expand the kingdom's boundaries. In 1860 the Taiping rebels were successful in taking [[Hangzhou]] and [[Suzhou]] to the east (See also: [[Second rout of the Army Group Jiangnan]]), but failed to take [[Battle of Shanghai (1861)|Shanghai]], which marked the beginning of the decline of the Kingdom.

===Fall===
[[Image:Naval battle between Taiping-Qing on Yangtze.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Taiping–Qing naval battle on the Yangtze river near Nanjing]]

An attempt to [[Battle of Shanghai (1861)|take Shanghai]] in August 1860 was initially successful but finally repulsed by a force of Chinese troops and European officers under the command of [[Frederick Townsend Ward]].&lt;ref name=son&gt;Spence (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; This army would later become the "[[Ever Victorious Army]]", led by [[Charles George Gordon|"Chinese" Gordon]], and would be instrumental in the defeat of the Taiping rebels. Imperial forces were reorganized under the command of [[Zeng Guofan]] and [[Li Hongzhang]], and the Qing government's reconquest began in earnest. By early 1864, Qing control in most areas was well established.

Hong declared that God would defend Nanjing, but in June 1864, with Qing forces approaching, he died of [[food poisoning]] as the result of eating wild vegetables as the city began to run out of food. He was sick for twenty days before the Qing forces could take the city. Only a few days after his death the Qing forces took the city. His body was buried and was later exhumed by Zeng to verify his death, and cremated. Hong's ashes were later blasted out of a cannon in order to ensure that his remains have no resting place as eternal punishment for the uprising.

Four months before the fall of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Hong Xiuquan abdicated in favour of [[Hong Tianguifu]], his eldest son, who was 15 years old then. Hong Tianguifu was unable to do anything to restore the kingdom, so the kingdom was quickly destroyed when Nanjing fell in July 1864 to Qing forces after vicious fighting in the streets. Most of the so-called princes were executed by Qing officials in Jinling Town ({{lang|zh-Hant|金陵城}}), Nanjing.

Although the fall of Nanjing in 1864 marked the destruction of the Taiping regime, the fight was not yet over. There were still several thousands of Taiping rebel troops continuing the fight. It took seven years to finally put down all remnants of the Taiping Rebellion. In August 1871 the last Taiping rebel army, led by [[Shi Dakai]]'s commander, [[Li Fuzhong]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|李福忠}}), was completely wiped out by the Qing forces in the border region of [[Hunan]], [[Guizhou]] and [[Guangxi]].

The Heavenly King was the highest position in the Heavenly Kingdom. The sole people to hold this position were Hong Xiuquan and his son Hong Tianguifu:

Ranked below the "King of Heaven" Hong Xiuquan, the [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] was divided among provincial rulers called kings or princes; initially there were five{{spaced ndash}}the Kings of the Four Cardinal Directions and the Flank King{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}). Of the original rulers, the West King and South King were killed in combat in 1852. The East King was murdered by the North King during a coup in 1856, and the North King himself was subsequently killed. The Kings' names were:
* South King ({{lang|zh-Hant|南王}}), [[Feng Yunshan]] (died 1852)
* East King ({{lang|zh-Hant|東王}}), [[Yang Xiuqing]] (died 1856)
* West King ({{lang|zh-Hant|西王}}), [[Xiao Chaogui]] (died 1852)
* North King ({{lang|zh-Hant|北王}}), [[Wei Changhui]] (died 1856)
* Flank King ({{lang|zh-Hant|翼王}}), [[Shi Dakai]] (captured and executed by Qing forces in 1863)

The later leaders of the movement were 'Princes':
* Zhong Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|忠王}}), [[Li Xiucheng]] (1823{{spaced ndash}}1864, captured and executed by Qing forces)
* Ying Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|英王}}), [[Chen Yucheng]] (1837{{spaced ndash}}1862)
* Gan Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|干王}}), [[Hong Rengan]] (1822{{spaced ndash}}1864; cousin of Hong Xiuquan, executed)
* Jun Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|遵王}}), [[Lai Wenkwok]] (1827{{spaced ndash}}1868)
* Fu Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|福王}}), Hong Renda ({{lang|zh-Hant|洪仁達}}; Hong Xiuquan's second-eldest brother; executed by Qing forces in 1864)
* Tian Gui ({{lang|zh-Hant|田貴}}; executed in 1864)

Other princes include:
* An Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|安王}}), Hong Renfa ({{lang|zh-Hant|洪仁發}}), Hong Xiuquan's eldest brother
* Yong Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|勇王}}), Hong Rengui ({{lang|zh-Hant|洪仁貴}})
* Fu Prince ({{lang|zh-Hant|福王}}), Hong Renfu ({{lang|zh-Hant|洪仁富}})

In the later years of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the territory was divided among many, for a time into the dozens, of provincial rulers called princes, depending on the whims of Hong.

Captured areas in [[Jiangsu]] were called “Sufu Province”.

==Policies==
[[File:Taiping tablet.jpg|thumb|The "Happiness" ([[wikt:福|福]]) tablet of Hong Xiuquan has a similar design with Chinese gospel tract flyer.]]
Within the land that it controlled, the [[Taiping Heavenly Army]] established a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], [[theocracy|theocratic]], and [[military dictatorship|highly militarized]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz H. Michael]], The Taiping Rebellion: History 190-91 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The subject of study for the [[Imperial examination#Qing dynasty|examinations]] for officials changed from the [[Confucianism|Confucian classics]] to the [[Bible]].
* Private property ownership was abolished and all land was held and distributed by the state.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 105 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[solar calendar]] replaced the [[lunar calendar]].
* [[Foot binding]] was banned. (The [[Hakka people]] had never followed this tradition, and consequently the Hakka women had always been able to work the fields.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1996, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Society was declared [[social class|classless]] and the sexes were declared equal. At one point, for the first time in Chinese history [[imperial exams|civil service exams]] were held for women. Some sources record that [[Fu Shanxiang]], an educated woman from Nanjing, passed them and became an official at the court of the Eastern King.
* The sexes were rigorously separated.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Kyle Crossley, The Wobbling Pivot: China Since 1800 105 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; There were separate army units consisting of women only; until 1855, not even married couples were allowed to live together or have sexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 1996, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Qing-dictated [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue hairstyle]] was abandoned in favor of wearing the hair long.
* Other new laws were promulgated including the prohibition of opium, gambling, tobacco, alcohol, polygamy (including concubinage), slavery, and prostitution. These all carried death penalties.

===Hong Rengan's proposed reforms===
In 1859 the Gan Prince Hong Rengan, with the approval of his cousin the Heavenly King, advocated several new policies, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teng |first1=Ssu-yü |last2=Fairbank |first2=John King |title=China's Response to the West: A Documentary survey 1839-1923 |date=1979 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674120256 |pages=57-59 |url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=0maVJuCh78oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Promoting the adoption of railways by granting patents for the introduction of locomotives; 21 railways were planned for each of the 21 provinces.
*Promoting the adoption of steamships for commerce and defence.
*Establishment of currency-issuing private banks.
*Granting of 10-year patents for introduction of new inventions, 5-year for minor items.
*Establishment of a National Postal Service.
*Promoting mineral exploration by granting control and twenty percent of the revenue to the discoverers of deposits.
*Introduction of governmental investigative officers.
*Introduction of independent impartial state media officers for reporting and disseminating news.
*Institution of district treasuries and paymasters to manage finances.

===Military equipment===
''Taiping Tianguo'' soldiers seem to have been partially equipped with surplus equipment sold by various Western companies and military units' stores, both small arms and artillery. One shipment of weaponry from an American dealer in April 1862 was listed as 2,783 (percussion cap) muskets, 66 carbines, 4 rifles, and 895 field artillery guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spence |first1=Jonathan D. |title=God's Chinese Son: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of Hong Xiuquan |date=1996 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=0393285863 |page=311 |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Y7fdCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious affairs===
{{Main|God Worshipping}}
Initially, the followers of Hong Xiuquan were called God Worshippers. Hong's faith was inspired by visions he reported in which the Christian [[God|Lord]] greeted him in Heaven. Hong had earlier been in contact with [[Protestant]] missionaries and read the Bible. Officially, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom endorsed Hong Xiuquan's own version of [[Christianity]] combined with elements of [[Chinese folk religion]], the "restored faith" in [[Shingdu]] and some other native beliefs. Although Hong's followers led the Kingdom, there were also adherents of [[Buddhism]], [[Chinese folk religion]] and other religious traditions native to China.

The movement's founder, Hong Xiuquan, had failed the imperial examinations numerous times. After one such failure in 1836, Hong overheard a Protestant missionary, most probably [[Edwin Stevens (missionary)|Edwin Stevens]]{{sfnb|Spence|1996|p= 31}}, preaching and took home some Chinese translations of Bible tracts, including a pamphlet entitled ''Good Words for Exhorting the Age'' by [[Liang Fa]]. Hong and his cousin were both baptized in accordance with Liang's directions.{{sfnb|Michael|1966|p = 25}} In 1843, after Hong's final failure at the exams, he had what some regard as a nervous breakdown and others as a mystical revelation, connecting his in-depth readings of the Christian tracts to strange dreams he had been having for the past six years. In his dreams, a bearded man with golden hair and a black robe called himself [[Jehovah]], gave him a sword, and taught him to slay demons beside a younger man whom Hong addressed as "Elder Brother".{{sfnb|Spence|1996|p= 171-172}}

Hong Xiuquan came to believe that the figures in his dreams were God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son, and that they were revealing his destiny as a slayer of demons and the leader of a new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth.&lt;ref name="WSU"&gt;Wsu.edu. "[http://www.wsu.edu:8001/~dee/CHING/TAIPING.HTM Wsu.edu]." ''Taiping Rebellion.'' Retrieved on 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The demons were later interpreted by him to be the Qing and false religions.

Hong developed a literalist understanding of the Bible, producing a set of his own annotations. He rejected the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], saying "God is the Father and embodies myriads of phenomena; Christ is the Son, who was manifest in the body... The Wind of the Holy Spirit, God, is also a Son... God is one who gives shapes to things, molds things into forms, who created heaven and created earth, who begins and ends all things, yet has no beginning or end himself..." and "God and the Savior are one."{{sfnb|Michael|1966|p = 138}}

=== Currency ===
{{Main|Shengbao (currency)}}

In its first year, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom minted coins that were 23&amp;nbsp;mm to 26&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, weighing around 4.1&amp;nbsp;[[gram|g]]. The kingdom's name was inscribed on the obverse and "Holy Treasure" ({{zh|{{linktext|聖|寶}}}}) on the reverse; the kingdom also issued paper notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecurrencycollector.com/|title=Money of the Kingdom of Heavenly Peace |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=The Currency Collector |publisher= |access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on Hakkas==
With the collapse of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Qing Dynasty launched waves of massacres against the [[Hakkas]], killing up to 30,000 each day during the height of the massacres.&lt;ref&gt;The Hakka Odyssey &amp; their Taiwan homeland - Page 120 Clyde Kiang - 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Another major impact was the bloody [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855 and 1867), which would cause the deaths of a million people.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Anthony Chang, [https://www.geni.com/projects/Hakka-Punti-Clan-Wars-Guangdong-China-1855-1867/25317 Hakka–Punti Clan Wars, Guangdong, China, 1855-1867] Geni&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notes ==
:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Note that the uncommon [[Variant Chinese character|variant character]] {{linktext|囯}} is used, as opposed to the more common {{linktext|國}} (and later, {{linktext|国}}). The Taiping used ''wang'' ({{linktext|王}}, "king") in the center of their character, as opposed to the traditional Chinese ''huo'' ({{linktext|或}}, "or", used as a phonetic marker) or the later simplified Chinese ''yu'' ({{linktext|玉}}, "jade").

:Note also that [[image:Ten.png|15px]] uses the traditional printed form of 天 with a longer upper stroke. This is similar to the Japanese ''ten'' {{lang|ja|天}}, but Unicode does not offer support as separate character, instead only displaying the Japanese version when Chinese functionality is disabled.

The '''Three Oaths''' is the popular name for a ''[[Midrash]]'' found in the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref name="Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 111a"&gt;Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 111a&lt;/ref&gt; which relates that God adjured three oaths upon the world. Two of the oaths pertain to the Jewish people, and one of the oaths pertains to the other nations of the world. The Jews for their part were sworn not to forcefully reclaim the [[Land of Israel]] and not to rebel against the other nations, and the other nations in their turn were sworn not to subjugate the Jews excessively.

Among [[Orthodox Jews]] today there are primarily two ways of viewing this ''Midrash''. A faction of the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] who are strongly [[Anti-Zionism#Religious opposition|anti-Zionist]] often view this ''Midrash'' as not being fulfilled, whereas the majority of the Haredim as well as [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]] view it as being fulfilled and maintained, and now obsolete. Both buttress their positions by citing historic rabbinic sources in favor of their view.

==The Midrash and the text upon which it expounds==

The context of the Talmudic dialogue containing the Three Oaths is a discussion in which attempts are made to defend [[Rav Zeira]]'s desire to leave [[Babylonian exile|Babylon]] and go to the Land of Israel. It begins on [[Nashim|Ketubot]] 110b and continues on 111a (where the Three Oaths are plainly conveyed). The Gemara quotes [[Jose b. Hanina|R. Yossi ben R. Chanina]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{rtl-para|he|{{hebrew|ג' שבועות הללו למה אחת שלא יעלו ישראל בחומה ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את ישראל שלא ימרדו באומות העולם ואחת שהשביע הקדוש ברוך הוא את אומות העולם שלא ישתעבדו בהן בישראל יותר מדאי.}}}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why/What are these Three Oaths? One, that [[Children of Israel|Israel]] should not storm the wall {[[Rashi|RaShI]] interprets: forcefully}. Two, [[List of Hebrew acronyms#Names of G-d|the Holy One]] adjured Israel not to rebel against the nations of the world. Three, the Holy One adjured the nations that they would not oppress Israel too much.&lt;ref name="Babylonian Talmud, Ketubot 111a"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Midrash is in large part an exegetical analysis of three separate verses in the [[Song of Songs]], and naturally reflects the traditional interpretation, which sees the entire book as an [[Mashal (allegory)|allegory]] for the relationship between [[God]] and the [[Jewish people]]. The three verses are:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* {{bibleverse|Song of Solomon|2:7}}: ''I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please''
* {{bibleverse|Song of Solomon|3:5}}: identical to 2:7.
* {{bibleverse|Song of Solomon|8:4}}: ''I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem: Why should ye awaken, or stir up love, until it please?''&lt;ref&gt;Translations: Jewish Publication Society 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Other midrashim concerning the Three Oaths==
There are several other Midrashim that pertain to the Three Oaths and they are primarily recorded in [[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]] which is also known as Midrash Hazita:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* "If it is a wall": if Israel [[The Return to Zion|had ascended]] like a wall from Babylon, [[Destruction of the Temple|the Temple would not have been destroyed]] during that period for a second time. [[Rabbi Zeira]] went to the marketplace to buy something. He said to the one who was weighing: that was weighed very fairly. He responded: Do not depart from here, Babylonian, because your ancestors [[Solomon's Temple#History|destroyed the Temple]]. At that moment Rabbi Zeira said, are not my ancestors the same as the ancestors of this one?! Rabbi Zeira entered the house of study and heard the voice of [[Rav Shela|Rabbi Sheila]] who was sitting and teaching: "'If it is a wall': if Israel had ascended like a wall from the [[Galut|Exile]], the Temple would not have been destroyed a second time." He said: the unlearned person taught me well.&lt;ref name="Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 8:11"&gt;Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 8:11&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jose b. Hanina|R. Yossi bar Chanina]] said: "There are two oaths here, one for Israel and one for the nations. Israel swore not to rebel against the nations [R. Yossi bar Chanina views Israel's two oaths in Ketuvot as just one], and the nations swore that they would not overly burden Israel, for by doing so they would cause the end of days to come prematurely."&lt;ref&gt;Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah, 2:[7]1&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rabbi Chelbo says ... And do not ascend like a wall from the Exile. If so, why is the [[Jewish messianism|King Messiah]] coming? To [[Kibbutz Galuyot|gather]] the [[Jewish diaspora|exiles of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 2:18&lt;/ref&gt;
* When [[Reish Lakish]] would see Jews from the Exile gathering in the marketplace in the [[Land of Israel]] he would say to them, 'Scatter yourselves.' He said to them: 'When you ascended you did not do so as a wall, and here you have come to make a wall.{{'}}&lt;ref name="Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah 8:11"/&gt;
* "Rabbi Yitsḥak opened: Before the day breathes and the shadows flee (Song of Songs 4:6). ''Before the day breathes''—the exile of Israel; that they would be subjugated in exile until the day when rule of the peoples is ended. For we have learned that Rabbi Yitsḥak said that the dominion of all peoples together over Israel would last one thousand years. There is no אוּמָה (''ummah''), people, that would not subjugate them. 'One day' corresponds to: ''But it shall be one day which shall be known to YHWH'' (Zechariah 14:7).

Another word: ''Before the day'' שֶׁיָּפוּחַ (''sheyafuaḥ''), ''breathes''—before that day the peoples יָפוּחַ (''yafuaḥ''), expire. ''And the shadows flee''—governments that dominate them. ''I will hurry to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense'' (Song of Songs 4:6). Said the blessed Holy One 'I will betake myself to shake the peoples from Jerusalem, the הַר הַמּוֹר (''har ha-mor''), ''the mountain of myrrh'',' as is written, ''Jerusalem on'' הַר הַמּוֹרִיָּה (''har ha-moriyah''), ''mount Moriah'' (2 Chronicles 3:1). ''And to the hill of frankincense''—the Temple that is in Zion, as it is written, ''Lovely in heights, all the earth's joy, Mount Zion'' (Psalms 48:3). And it is written, ''To seize the earth's corners, that the wicked be shaken from it'' (Job 38:13)—as one holds a garment to shake all the filth from it.

Rabbi Yose said, the blessed Holy One will eventually be revealed in earthly Jerusalem, and purify it from the filth of the peoples, before the day of the peoples is complete. For Rabbi Ḥiyya said: Dominion over Israel lasts only one day, and that is a day of the blessed Holy One which is one thousand years [cf. BT ''Sanhedrin'' 97a; ''Bahir'' §5: Each day of the blessed Holy One is a thousand years, as it is written, ''For a thousand years in Your eyes are like yesterday gone'' (Psalms 90:4)]. This is what is written, ''He has made me desolate, faint all the day'' (Lamentations 1:13)—one day, and no more.

Rabbi Yose said, If they are subjugated more than one thousand years, it is not because of the King's decree, but rather because they do not wish to return before Him [in repentance to the Land of Israel]. And it is written, ''And it shall be, when all these things come upon you'', [''the blessing and the curse that I have set before you, that your heart shall turn back among all the nations to which YHWH your God will make you to stray''] (Deuteronomy 30:1-2), and, ''Should your strayed one be at the edge of the heavens, from there shall YHWH your God gather you.'' (ibid. 4)&lt;ref&gt;(Zohar 2:17a, ''Midrash ha-Ne'elam'', cf. Zohar 3:270b).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Viewpoint of the rishonim==

===Maimonides===

[[Rambam]] cited the Three Oaths in his famous [[Epistle to Yemen|Epistle to the Jews of Yemen]] (Iggeret Teiman). It was written around 1172 in reply to an inquiry concerning the crisis the [[Yemenite Jews]] were then going through. A decree of [[Forced conversion#Islam|forced conversion to Islam]] which had thrown the Jews into panic. Coupled with this crisis was the rise of a Messianic movement started by a native of Yemen who [[False messiah|claimed he was the Messiah]] which served to further increase the confusion within the Jewish community. In the course of Maimonides attempt to strengthen the morale of the Yemenite Jews. In the Epistle he states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{rtl-para|he|{{hebrew|ולפי שידע שלמה ע"ה ברוח הקדש שהאומה הזו כאשר תלכד בגלות תיזום להתעורר שלא
בזמן הראוי ויאבדו בכך וישיגום הצרות הזהיר מכך והשביע עליו על דרך המשל ואמר
השבעתי אתכם בנות ירושלים וכו}}&lt;ref&gt;Iggeret Teiman Ch. 4, Kafach Edition, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Solomon]], of blessed memory, foresaw with [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Divine inspiration]], that the prolonged duration of the exile would incite some of our people to seek to terminate it before the proper time, and as a consequence they would perish or meet with disaster. Therefore he warned them (to desist) from it and adjured them in [[Mashal (allegory)|metaphorical language]], as we read, "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the hinds of the field, that ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please." (Song of Songs 2:7, 8:4). Now, brethren and friends, abide by the oath, and stir not up love until it please (Ketubot 111a).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Epistle to YemenMoses|Maimonides. Epistle to Yemen. Ch. XX.]] 1952 English translation by Boaz Cohen, published in New York by American Academy for Jewish Research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bahya ben Asher===

The Mid Thirteenth Century commentator [[Bahya ben Asher|Rabbeinu Bachya]], was one of the first to formulate a comprehensive Torah commentary based on the four principles denoted by the word "[[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|PaRDeS]]". In his commentary on {{bibleref|Genesis|32:7|HE}} he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... and it is written "And [[Hezekiah]] prayed before God" ({{bibleref|2Kings|19:15|HE}}). So too we are required to follow in the way of the Patriarchs and to restore ourselves so that we may be graciously accepted and with our fine language and prayer before God, may He be exalted. However, to wage war is not possible (Song of Songs 2), "you have been adjured daughters of Jerusalem, etc." You have been adjured not to engage in war with the nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14069&amp;pgnum=109&amp;hilite= Midrash Rabbeinu Bachya on Genesis 32:7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Nachmanides===

[[Nachmanides|Ramban]] did not explicitly discuss the Three Oaths, however he did maintain that it is incumbent upon Jews in every generation as a positive commandment to attempt to conquer the [[Land of Israel]]. In his glosses (Hashmatot) to Rambam's [[Sefer HaMitzvot]] on Positive Commandment #4 he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That we are commanded to take possession of the Land which the Almighty, Blessed Be He, [[Promised Land|gave to our forefathers]], to [[Avraham]], to [[Yitzchak]], and to [[Yaakov]]; and not to abandon it to other nations, or to leave it desolate, as He said to them, You shall dispossess the inhabitants of the Land and dwell in it, for I have given the Land to you to possess it, (Numbers, 33:53) and he said, further, To Inherit the Land which [[Brit bein habetarim|I swore to your forefathers]], (to give them,) behold, we are commanded with the conquest of the land in every generation.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmatot HaRaMBaN al Sefer Hamitzvot. Translation from Torat Eretz Yisrael by David Samson p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nachmanides' position here is untenable if he maintains that the Three Oaths are Halachically binding. Accordingly, it would appear that Nachmanides implicitly rejects the Three Oaths as Halachically binding, and that to treat it as such would be to effectively nullify a biblical commandment.

The anti-Zionist response to this is that Nachmanides' words "we are commanded with the conquest of the land in every generation" mean every generation until the era of exile. One of the established rules for counting the 613 commandments in the Torah is that we do not count one-time-only commandments, such as God's command to count the Jews in Numbers 1:2. Nachmanides' intent here is to prove that conquering the land was not a one-time-only commandment that applied to Joshua's battles; rather it applied to King David and, by extension, in every generation. This justifies counting it among the 613, even if it does not apply during exile, just as numerous commandments associated with the Temple are counted despite the fact that they cannot be kept during exile. Nachmanides does say explicitly later in the piece that the commandment to live in the Land applies even during exile, but this means strictly living there as an individual - not conquering, since that would conflict with the Three Oaths.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, Vayoel Moshe, ''Maamar Yishuv Eretz Yisroel'', Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been proposed that Nachmanides' intent was that even the commandment that a Jew should live in the land as an individual during exile applies only when living in the land is consistent with exile, that is, when a non-Jewish government rules the land. But living under a Jewish government such as the State of Israel might itself constitute a violation of the oath. Nachmanides felt no need to mention this exception to the commandment because he did not foresee the rise of a Jewish government in the Holy Land before the messiah.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi David Smith, ''Derech Hachaim'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is that [[Solomon ben Simon Duran|Rashbash]] who was himself a descendant of Nachmanides, understood this particular biblical obligation to be binding on the individual level but not on the collective:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In truth, this commandment is not a commandment which includes the entirety of Israel in the Exile which now exists, but it is a general principle as our Sages stated in the Talmud in Ketubot, that it stems from the Oaths which The Holy One, Blessed be He, made Israel swear not to rush the End, and not to ascend like a wall.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa Rashbash, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, Nachamnides himself explicitly states in his ''Hassagot'' (Positive Commandment #4):
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The sages] made many other such emphatic statements regarding this positive commandment that we are commanded to possess the Land and settle it. It is therefore an eternal positive command, obligating every single individual even during the time of Exile as is known from the Talmud in many places.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmanides, Moses, Addendum to Maimonides' Book of Commandments (positive #4)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Reuven Firestone, [http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/articles/medieval-holy-war.php "Judaism - Medieval Period"]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rabbi [[Chaim Zimmerman]] in his book, ''Torah and Existence'' explains his solution to the contradiction between Nachmanides's position and the Three Oaths. First, he makes a distinction between ''settling'' the land and ''conquering'' the land. The commandment is realized by ''settling'' the land, and ''conquering'' is merely a preparation for the core obligation of settlement. The obligation to settle the land does not necessarily violate the Three Oaths. Rabbi Zimmerman adds that the Three Oaths only apply to invading the land by force. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the difficulty in the Ramban which says that the mitzva of kibush prevails in our time against the oath, dissolves. The oath, ''shelo yaalu bechoma'' means explicitly that we cannot storm eretz-Yisrael from chutz-laaretz. But when the Jews are in eretz-Yisrael, there is surely a hechsher mitzva of kibbush-haaretz. How can the Jews be in eretz-Yisrael without the aliyah "bechoma"? The answer is very simple. If many Jews came to eretz-Yisrael individually, or by permission of the nations, then once they are there, there is a command of kibbush.... There was never an oath upon the people who were in eretz-Yisrael.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmerman |first=Chaim |title=Torah And Existence. |publisher=A.A.E. Inc. U.S.A. |year=1986 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Tzvi Magence (1914-1989) in his Magen Tzvi who writes that oaths only applies to those living outside the Land of Israel.&lt;blockquote&gt;שהשבועה שלא יעלו בחומה אין זה נגד מצות כבוש הארץ... כי השבועה שלא יעלו בחומה היתה על אלה שגלו וישבו בבבל או בכל מקום אחר בחו״ל, עליהם נאמר  שלא יעלו בחומה ושפיר אתי הלשון שלא יעלו. אכל
 אלה היושבים בציון עליהם לא היתה כלל השבועה שלא ילחמו&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Viewpoint of the early Acharonim==

===Maharal===

[[Maharal]] discussed the Three Oaths in two locations, in his work [[Maharal#Works|Netzach Yisrael]] and in his commentary to Tractate Ketubot.&lt;ref&gt;First published from original manuscripts in 1960. See R. Gil Student, [http://www.yasharbooks.com/Religious%20Zionism%20Debate.pdf Religious Zionism Debate p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt; In his work Netzach Yisrael he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
כי פירוש 'בדורו של שמד' היינו במדה שהיה לדורו של שמד, שהיו דביקים בה דורו של שמד, ובאותה מדה השביע אותם שלא ישנו בענין הגלות. כי דורו של שמד, אף על גב שהגיע להם המיתה בגלות, לא היו משנים. ועוד פירוש 'בדורו של שמד', רוצה לומר אף אם יהיו רוצים להמית אותם בעינוי קשה, לא יהיו יוצאים ולא יהיו משנים בזה. וכן הפירוש אצל כל אחד ואחד, ויש להבין זה
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Another explanation of the Midrash's statement (he is speaking of Shir Ha-Shirim Rabba 2:20 that begins "ורבנן אמרי השביען בדורו של שמד") that God adjured the Jewish people in a generation of Shmad (religious persecution Jews, or decrees against Jews): that even if they will threaten to kill them with difficult torture, they will not leave [the Exile] nor will they change their behavior in this manner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/14200 Netzach Yisrael, Ch. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Rabbi Chaim Vital===
The 16th Century [[Kabbalist]], [[Chaim Vital|Rabbi Chaim Vital]] expressed the view that the Three Oaths were only binding for the first thousand years of Exile. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'I made you swear, daughters of Jerusalem...' this great oath to God was that they should not arouse the Redemption until that love will be desired and with good will, as it is written 'until I desire,' and our Sages already said that the time of this oath is a thousand years, as it is written in the [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael|Baraita of Rabbi Yishmael]] in [[Heichalot|Pirkei Heichalot]] (in a comment on [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:25)..., and similarly in the [[Zohar]] II:17a...that it is one day of the Exile of the Community of Israel...&lt;ref&gt;R. Chaim Vital's Introduction to [[Chaim Vital#Etz Hayyim|Sefer Eitz Chayim]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Modern era==

===Debate on the appropriate understanding of Maimonides===

Religious Zionists suggest that in Maimonides' Epistle to Yemen, he explicitly interprets the oaths metaphorically, and not literally. As it states there "Therefore he admonished and adjured them in metaphorical language (דרך המשל, lit. by way of metaphor) to desist." Therefore, they maintain, that Maimonides did not consider them to be Halachically binding.&lt;ref name="Student p. 18"&gt;R. Gil Student, [http://www.yasharbooks.com/Religious%20Zionism%20Debate.pdf The Religious Zionism Debate p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

A member of the Haredi community, [[Chaim Walkin|Rabbi Chaim Walkin]] points out in his book, Da'at Chaim, that Maimonides discussed the Three Oaths only in the Epistle to Yemen, but not in his Halachic work, the [[Mishne Torah]]. R. Walkin postulates that this is because while Maimonides saw these oaths as important, he did not consider them to be legally binding as Halacha, only that they serve as "warnings that these actions would be unsuccessful".&lt;ref&gt;Rebbetzin Dev orah Fastag, [http://www.messiahtruth.com/zionism.html Zionism]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joel Teitelbaum|Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum]] (the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar Rebbe]]) however, in his book [[Vayoel Moshe]] noted that the Rambam cites the Three Oaths in Iggeret Teiman, in a way that makes it appear that he is discussing binding Halachah. In using the description "metaphorical", Maimonides is referring to the nature of the text of the Song of Songs, and not to the Three Oaths themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Va-Yoel Moshe, Ma'amar Gimmel Shevu'os, ch. 36, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Satmar Rebbe however did not consider the breaking of the oaths a halachic issue, but rather a form of heresy. He stated that "the oath was not given to heretics but to all Jewry; and even if the whole Government were pious like men of old, any attempt to take their freedom prematurely would be to deny the Holy Law and our faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Holy Land, Holy Language: A Study of an Ultraorthodox Jewish Ideology |author=Lewis Glinert |author2=Yosseph Shilhav |journal=Language in Society |volume=20 |number=1 |date=March 1991 |page=67 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |doi=10.1017/s0047404500016079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate on the appropriate understanding of Maharal===

Religious Zionists argue that Maharal considered the oaths to be a Divine decree (which has thus subsequently expired). They rely upon his commentary to Ketubot which more explicitly indicates that he understood the Oaths to be binding insofar as it is up to God to permit the circumstances wherein Jews can engage in said activities, but it is not binding insofar as Jews are not actually prohibited from engaging in the acts the Oaths are concerned with. They maintain that there is a certain degree of ambiguity in what he has written in Netzach Yisrael and therefore his position must be seen in such a manner, for "anything to the contrary yields a contradiction within the Maharal's own writings",&lt;ref name="Student p. 18" /&gt; which would clearly be undesirable.

However, the position of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum (the Satmar Rebbe) in respect to whether Maharal understood the Oaths as prohibitively binding upon Jews is based primarily upon what was written in Netzach Yisrael. It is uncertain whether he considered and factored in Maharal's position in his commentary on Ketubot. (Whether this is due to his not having had access to it, not having been aware of it, or having viewed the text as a forgery is unknown.) However, according to his understanding of the Maharal any violation of the Oaths is absolutely prohibited, [[Yehareg v'al ya'avor|even on pain of death]].

In response to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers have said that even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the right moment. In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing Russian roulette. Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.&lt;ref name="truetorahjews.org"&gt;http://www.truetorahjews.org/qanda/student&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zionist arguments that consider the Three Oaths===
An overview of some of the primary claims made by Religious Zionists concerning the Three Oaths:
* The Three Oaths are an [[Aggadic Midrash]], and therefore they are not Halakhically obligatory (Aggadic Midrashim, as opposed to [[Halachic]] Midrashim are not traditionally understood as a valid source for Halacha). Accordingly, Maimonides' [[Mishne Torah]], the [[Arba'ah Turim]], the [[Shulchan Aruch]], and other halachic sources do not cite the Three Oaths or rule accordingly. They are not found there at all.
* The Balfour Declaration, San Remo Resolution, League of Nations Mandate of Palestine, and [[UN Resolution 181|United Nations]] resolution recommending the establishment of a Jewish State fulfill the first condition of the oath to not rebel against the nations. Thus, when the United Nations told the Jews to go home, it was mandatory that they do so. Just as Cyrus instructed the Jews of Babylonia to construct the Second Temple. This position is held by [[Eliezer Waldenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;ציץ אליעזר, חלק ז, סימן מח. Tzitz Eliezer 7:48.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.
* The Three Oaths simply meant that God had decreed an exile for the Jewish people. The fact that the Jewish people have successfully returned to the Land of Israel, and that the State of Israel has survived, is evidence that the oath is void and the decree has ended.
* The wording of Maimonides in his Epistle to Yemen specifically states that the Oaths are "metaphorical" (see [[Three Oaths#Maimonides|Maimonides above]]), furthermore in his Halachic work he places great value upon living in the Land of Israel, and forbids leaving it.&lt;ref&gt;Hilchos Melachim 5:9 "It is forbidden to leave Eretz Yisrael for the Diaspora at all times except: to study Torah; to marry; or to save [one's property] from the gentiles. [After accomplishing these objectives,] one must return to Eretz Yisrael."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the Three Oaths were obligatory in the past, the gentiles violated their vow by excessively persecuting the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Rabbi Meir|title=Three Oaths|url=http://mkwords.com/text/index.php?i=222&amp;a=Three%20Oaths|website=mkwords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the validity of the two other vows has been nullified. Religious Zionists point to a specific Midrash warning that if gentile nations violated this oath, then "they cause the End of Days to come prematurely."&lt;ref&gt;Shir HaShirim Rabba, 2[7]1)&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted to mean that Israel's re-establishment would be implemented sooner than originally intended. With atrocities against Jews throughout history, and especially after [[The Holocaust]], the Jewish people were absolved of their part of the Oaths. Those who hold this position often rely on the [[Shulchan Aruch]] which states: "two [persons] who have taken an oath to do a thing, and one of them violates the oath, the other is exempt [from it] and does not require permission."&lt;ref&gt;Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 236:6&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the ban on mass-immigration to the Land of Israel became void,&lt;ref&gt;Zionists claim that this position was maintained by Shlomo Kluger in his Maasei Yedei Yotzer. However, Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum argued that Kluger used this argument only to permit excessive prayer for the redemption, not action. (Vayoel Moshe, Maamar Shalosh Shevuos, ch. 79, p. 98) It was also maintained by Rabbi Meir Kahane in Or Hara'ayon&lt;/ref&gt; and Zionism and the State of Israel arose as a direct result of the breach by gentile nations of the Oaths.
* Religious Zionists often point to Israel's seemingly miraculous survival in the numerous Arab-Israeli wars, especially the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and [[Six-Day War]], and interpret this as the State of Israel being preserved directly by God's hand.
* The Jewish people did not return ''en masse'' to the Land of Israel, but rather through individual immigration as well as a series of five [[Aliyah]]s. Jews continue to individually immigrate to Israel today. There was never a point in history where a majority of world Jewry collectively migrated to the Land of Israel.
* It is not clearly established in either the [[Gemara]] or the [[Halacha]] what precisely would constitute permission from the nations. As such, the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], [[San Remo conference]], [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181]], and the [[League of Nations]]-issued Mandate for Palestine plan of July 24, 1922 is understood as representing permission and approval from the nations of the world. Accordingly, the Jewish people cannot be considered to have rebelled against the nations. This was the opinion of [[Rabbi]] [[Meir Simcha of Dvinsk]] regarding the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]].
* Many authorities understand the oath of "not ascending as a wall" as only including an immigration of the entire (or at least a majority of the) nation. Some of these authorities also require that this mass immigration be one of force in order for the oath to be considered violated. Among those who hold these positions are [[Isaiah Achron]] in his Piskei Ri'az,&lt;ref&gt;אין להם לישראל לעלות יחד וביד חזקה כעין קיבוץ גלייות...שנאמר אם תעירו ואם תעוררו את האהבה עד שתחפץ .Cited in קובץ שיטות קמאי ,כתובות - ח"ג. http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46241&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=957&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bezalel Ashkenazi]] in his Shittah Mekubetzet,&lt;ref&gt;Shittah Mekubetzet, Ketubot 110b. בחומה: שלא יעלו מאליהם ויעלו כולם ביחד בחזקה&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Maharal]],&lt;ref&gt;Netzach Israel, Chapter 24.דהיינו שיקבצו מן הפיזור ויעלו בחומה לשוב מן האומות...וכנגד שאני מפזרן גזר עליהן שלא יעלו בחומה שזהו קיבוץ גליות, והוא בטול הפיזור. Here, the Maharal equates violating the oath with the in-gathering of exiles.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]],&lt;ref&gt;אהבת יהונתן, ואתחנן: דכנסת ישראל צוחה באלה ובשבועה אם תעירו ואם תעוררו את האהבה נגד '''קיבוץ ישראלי''' באם שהכל נועדו יחדיו לילך לירושלים וכל האומות מסכימים אפ״ה צווחה שחלילה שתלך שמה.&lt;br&gt; While he insists that oaths applies even when the nations of the world agree to the restoration of Israel, he addresses his position in regards to a gathering of the exiles, and not some other mass immigration.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yisroel ben Shmuel of Shklov]] and students of the [[Vilna Gaon]],&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern, Arie. Hastening Redemption. Oxford University Press, 2006. "Israel of Shklov's messianic worldview ... was shared, at least in part, by all of the Vilna Ga'on's disciples. He rejects the prohibition, which underlies the traditional concept of the Three Oaths, against 'scaling the wall' or hastening the redemption; he claims that "1even if all of them [the Jews] or even most of them are not authorized to scale the wall to the Land of Israel, there is no prohibition against individuals."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meir Blumenfeld]],&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld maintains that the Oaths are in fact binding upon the Jewish people despite the nations of the world having violated it. However, the Zionists have not violated the Oaths because firstly there was no rebellion against the nations of the world (as they have consented to it), and furthermore "ascending as a wall" refers to the immigration of the majority of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel at once. Rabbi Blumenfeld bolsters his position by pointing towards a comment made by [[Rashi]] (on BT Yoma 9b) that defines the differentiation between the phrase "like a door" and "like a wall". The former refers to part, or half of the population and the latter to the majority of it. "There is no comparison between oaths between two individual and the oaths adjured by God.... The [Three] Oaths were unconditional obligations between Israel and the nations. If there is a possibility that we may ascend to the Land of Israel, it would only7 be because we wouldn't be ascending like a wall ... and wouldn't be rebelling against the nations, because the nations of the world themselves have agreed that this portion of land shall belong to the Jews.... The intent [of the phrase 'ascend like a wall' is the ascent of the people all at once, or certainly more than half [the people], as is explained in Yoma 9 ... and explained by Rashi." See [http://hebrewbooks.org/2573 Ohr HaTorah] (1962), and "Concerning the Oath That They Not Ascend as a Wall" (in Hebrew) in Shana be-shana (Jerusalem 1974), pp. 148–53.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] as understood by [[Joel Teitelbaum]],&lt;ref&gt;VaYoel Moshe. Chapter 80. Here the Satmar Rebbe offers an explanation why Maimonides didn't include the Three Oaths in his code. Maimonides in Laws Of Repentance 7:5 states that "Israel shall only be redeemed through repentance." The Satmar Rebbe explains that denial of this statement of Maimonides is heresy. Hence, any redemptive action taken before Israel repents is considered heretical. Immigration of a large, but minority, group wouldn't be considered a redemptive attempt and would not be a heretical action. Such immigration would not violate Laws Of Repentance, and if forbidden would have to be mentioned elsewhere in Maimonides' code. Immigration of the majority of Jews, however, would be a redemptive attempt. Without repentance, such immigration would be heretical and forbidden by the Laws Of Repentance. Since, by implication, it has already been forbidden by Laws Of Repentance, there would be no need for Maimonides to mention it explicitly elsewhere in his code.&lt;/ref&gt; and Yonah Dov Blumberg.&lt;ref&gt;Blimberg, קונטרס מצות ישיבת ארץ ישראל. Published 1898. On page 42, he writes: אלא ודאי צ״ל דמשום שאז בימי עזרא ע״י שהיתה העליה ברשיון כורש, עי״ז הותרה השבועה מפני שאז אין מקום לשבועה זו שהיא רק כשאין לזה רשיון המלכות ... לעלות ״כחומה״ פי׳ כלם יחד בבת אחת
"In the days of Ezra, since the immigration was with permission of Cyrus... the oath was lifted since then there was no relevancy of the oath which only applies when there isn't permission from the government ... 'to ascend as a wall' means all together at once."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Baruch Epstein]], in his Torah Temimah, understands the oath to only include a forceful mass immigration,&lt;ref&gt;Torah Temimah, [[Song of Songs]] 2:7, footnote 83: "[That means] to gather and go up to the Land with force. As it states in Yoma 9b, 'If you were to make yourselves as a wall and ascend all together as in the days of Ezra.' And this is the language that's used in Joel 2:7, 'they climb the wall like men of war.'"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ishtori Haparchi]] in his Kaftor Vaferach&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 10. מיהו לא יעלו על מנת לכבוש&lt;/ref&gt; understands the oath to mean immigration with intent to conquer. Isaac Leon ibn Zur in his Megillat Ester on Nachmanides also understands the oath as prohibiting conquest.&lt;ref&gt;נצטוינו בכתובות דף קי״א. שלא נמרד באומות ללכת לכבש הארץ בחזקה ... שלא יעלו בחומה. We are commanded in Ketubot 111a not to rebel against the Nations by going and conquering the land by force....&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Zionist arguments that consider the Three Oaths===
An overview of some of the primary claims made by anti-Zionists concerning the Three Oaths:

*Although the Three Oaths are Aggadic in style, precedent shows when Aggadic material in the Talmud presents novel legal material (as opposed to punishments and rewards relating to legal material expounded elsewhere in the Talmud), that material is codified as halacha, unless there is a specific reason not to.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.truetorahjews.org/qanda/agadah&lt;/ref&gt;
*Even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, the existence of the modern State of Israel does not constitute proof that the decree has ended, because the state's future is still uncertain.&lt;ref name="truetorahjews.org"/&gt;
*The Satmar Rebbe, in his book Vayoel Moshe maintains that Maimonides spoke of the Three Oaths as binding. (See [[Three Oaths#Debate on the appropriate understanding of Maimonides|Modern Debate on the Appropriate Understanding of Maimonides above]])
*The oaths are between the Jewish people and God, and the gentiles and God respectively. The fact that the gentiles violated their oath does not tacitly mean that the Jewish people are free to do so as well. Historically, atrocities prior to the Holocaust have generally not prompted rabbinic encouragement of mass immigration to Israel, though there have been some notable exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Historically there have been some instances where persecution served as the impetus for Jewish migration to the Land of Israel, even prior to WWII. Due to a wave of pogroms "the students of Rabbi Elijah of Vilna, the Gaon of Vilna, left Lithuania and immigrated to Safed and Jerusalem in Eretz Israel. The available evidence strongly indicates that the Gaon not only condoned their aliya; he actually decreed it, because he was convinced that the year 1840 was to be the year of 'atchalta degeulah', 'the beginning of the redemption'. {{cite journal |title=Messianism, Zionism, and the State of Israel |author=Chaim I. Waxman |journal=Modern Judaism |volume=7 |number=2 |date=May 1987 |page=176 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Hile Wechsler (1843-1894) strongly encouraged emigration to Palestine to avoid anti-Semitism which he predicted would engulf Germany and most of Europe. {{cite book |last=Kirsch |first=James |title=The Reluctant Prophet |publisher=Sherborne Press, Inc. |location=Los Angeles |year=1973 |isbn=0-8202-0156-1}} {{ISBN|385630519X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Living in Eretz Yisroel is not a general mitzvah for the Jews collectively, only individuals (see discussion of Rashbash (Solomon ben Simon Duran) in [[Three Oaths#Nachmanides|Nachmanides section above]]).
*The Balfour Declaration never covered the Oaths.
*The [[State of Israel]] has expanded its borders beyond the areas mandated by the UN and have thus expanded the borders without the permission of the nations.
*The [[United Nations]]' approval of the establishment of the State of Israel does not constitute permission from the nations of the world. The Halacha attaches no significant value to the United Nations. The relevant approval should be that of some of the other people who live in the land (in this instance, the [[Palestinian People|Palestinian]] [[Arabs]]).&lt;ref&gt;The Satmar Rebbe viewed the UN as imbued with strength and actual power, regardless of whether he saw it as a Halachically recognized organization. He states: "Even according to the natural order, were they to yield their government and Zionist State, there is no doubt that the United Nations could make arrangements to prevent war and bloodshed." Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, Al Ha-Geulah ve-al Ha-Temurah, pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In response to the Zionists' use of Rabbi Chaim Vital (see above), the Satmar Rebbe argued that Vital's remarks refer not to the Three Oaths incumbent on the Jewish people, but to God's oath not to redeem the Jewish people unless they repent out of love. This oath lasts a thousand years; after that point even repentance out of fear can bring the redemption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truetorahjews.org/qanda/rabbichaimvital&lt;/ref&gt;
*In response to questions of why God would allow the Zionists some measure of success if Zionism is against the Talmud; anti-Zionist religious Jews respond with the following; "The fallacy of the argument lies in the undeniable fact that there is evil in this world. Hashem allows people free will to choose to do wrong, and even to be successful in doing wrong on a large scale.... Why Hashem decided to grant their efforts some degree of success is one of the mysteries of our era. But the fact that they succeeded is no more a proof that they were doing the right thing, than is the fact that the Germans succeeded in killing six million Jews a proof that they were doing the right thing."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.truetorahjews.org/qanda/success&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Haredim who subscribe to the anti-Zionist view still immigrate to the Land of Israel. Their rationalization is that they do so only as individuals and families, but not as members of the organized mass-immigration, and that they come to the Land solely to live there, not in order to conquer it or rule over it. Such Haredim accordingly do not believe themselves to be in violation of the Three Oaths.

'''Viriathus''' (also spelled '''Viriatus'''; known as ''Viriato'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; died 139 BC) was the most important leader of the [[Lusitanians|Lusitanian people]] that resisted [[Roman Republic|Roman]] expansion into the regions of western [[Hispania]] (as the Romans called it) or western [[Iberia]] (as the Greeks called it), where the [[Roman province]] of [[Lusitania]] would be finally established after the conquest. This Roman province spread over areas comprising most of [[Portugal]] (the northernmost part was included in [[Gallaecia]]), all of [[Extremadura (Spain)|Extremadura]] and the province of [[Salamanca]]. Its eastern frontier reached the proximities of Toletum, in central [[Hispania]]. Current [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] was not included in the province, since it comprised most of the territory of another province, the aforementioned [[Gallaecia]], but like the Vettonian people in the South, the Galaic tribes living there were also related to them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3C*.html Strabo, Geography, Book III, Chapter 3] "...the most of the Lusitanians are called Callaicans."&lt;/ref&gt;

Viriatus developed alliances with other Iberian groups, even far away from his usual theatres of war, inducing them to rebel against Rome. He led his army, supported by most of the Lusitanian and Vetton tribes as well as by other Celtiberian allies, to several victories over the Romans between 147 BC and 139 BC before being betrayed by them and murdered while sleeping. Of him,  [[Theodor Mommsen]] said, "It seemed as if, in that thoroughly prosaic age, one of the Homeric heroes had reappeared."&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mommsen, ''The History Of Rome, Book IV'' p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
There are several possible etymologies for the name Viriatus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ler.letras.up.pt/uploads/ficheiros/3871.pdf Armando Silva, ''O nome de Viriato''.]&lt;/ref&gt; The name can be composed of two elements: ''Viri'' and ''Athus''.
''Viri'' may come from:
*the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[Proto-Indo-European root|root]] *uiros, "man", relating to strength and virility;
*the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] *uiro- 'man'; and  the older forms viros, viri, viro, viron from which derived the [[Old Irish]] word for man, ''fir'';&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://sunsite.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/mirror/ibiblio/gutenberg/1/2/1/1/12111/12111-h/12111-h.htm Douglas Hyde, ''The Glories of Ireland, Irish Language and Letters''.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*from *''uei''-, as in the ''viriae'' or [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] "twisted armbands" used by warriors ([[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] XXIII, 39);&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_10/garcia_quintela_6_10.html Celtic Elements in Northwestern Spain in Pre-Roman times.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*the [[Latin]] ''viri'' (pronounced "wee-ree", coming from the Indo-European root above) meaning man, hero, person of courage, honor, and nobility.

The Celtiberian elite called themselves  '''uiros ueramos''', meaning  the 'highest man' and the Latin equivalent would be ''summus vir''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dQC9O-9DAJoC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;vq=language&amp;dq=pausanias+spain&amp;as_brr=3&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;cad=4&amp;sig=ACfU3U1VAnYerD7vAVJpVSgQeqbb7PEiZA#PPA128,M1 The romanization of central Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historian [[Adolf Schulten|Schulten]], Viriatus had a Celtic name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/celts/celt3a.pdf The greatness and decline of the Celts. Hubert, Henry]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viriatus' life ==
[[Image:Nt-Viriato Viseu.jpg|thumb|200px|Statue of Viriatus in [[Viseu]].]]
{{pull quote|text=For he was, as is agreed by all, valiant in dangers, prudent and careful in providing whatever was necessary, and that which was most considerable of all was, that whilst he commanded he was more beloved than ever any was before him.|author=[[Diodorus Siculus]]}}

Little is known about Viriatus. The only reference to the location of his native tribe was made by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], who claims he was from the Lusitanian tribes of the ocean side.

He belonged to the class of warriors, the occupation of the minority ruling elites. He was known to the Romans as the ''[[dux]]'' of the Lusitanian army, as the ''adsertor'' (protector) of Hispania,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/eutropius/eutropius4.shtml Eutropii Breviarium Liber Quartus]&lt;/ref&gt; or as an ''[[imperator]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/florus_epitome1.html Flori Epitome de Tito Livio Bellorum Omnium Annorum DCC, XXXIII.]&lt;/ref&gt; probably of the confederated Lusitanian and [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-gtarpa.usc.es/descarga/CapaTapa/Tapa/TAPA28.pdf Marco Quintela, ''La organización socio-política de los Populi del Noroeste de la Península.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]] described him as a shepherd who became a hunter, then a soldier, thus following the path of most young warriors, the ''iuventus'', who devoted themselves to cattle raiding, hunting and war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol6/6_2/gorbea_lorrio_6_2.html War and Society in the Celtiberian World]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Appian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_00.html Appian, ''The Foreign Wars, The Wars In Spain'', ed. Horace White]&lt;/ref&gt; Viriatus was one of the few who escaped when [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|Galba]], the Roman governor, massacred the ''flos iuventutis'', the flower of the young Lusitanian warriors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Valerius_Maximus/9*.html Valeri Maximi, ''Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium'']&lt;/ref&gt; in 150 BC.

Two years after the massacre, in 148 BC, Viriatus became the leader of a Lusitanian army.

Viriatus was thought by some to have a very obscure origin,&lt;ref name="Dio"&gt;[[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History, Fragments of Books XXII through XXIX.''&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Diodorus Siculus]] also says that Viriatus "approved himself to be a prince" and  that he said he was "lord and owner of all".&lt;ref name="Diodorus"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/HistoricalLibrary Historical library of Diodorus the Sicilian. p. 543 to p. 620]&lt;/ref&gt; His family was unknown to the Romans who were familiar with the native aristocratic warrior society.
His personality and his physical and intellectual abilities as well as his skills as a warrior were described by several authors. He was a man of great physical strength, probably in the very prime of life, an excellent strategist,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-623387/Variathus Britannica Online Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt; and possessor of a brilliant mind. Some authors claim that the ancient authors described Viriatus with  the precise features of a Celtic king.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

He was described as a man who followed the principles of honesty and fair dealing and was acknowledged for being exact and faithful to his word on the treaties and alliances he made.&lt;ref name=" Diodorus "/&gt; Livy gives him the title of ''vir duxque magnus''&lt;ref name="livi"&gt;[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/livy/liv.per54.shtml TITI LIVI AB URBE CONDITA LIBER LIV PERIOCHA]&lt;/ref&gt; with the implied qualities that were nothing more than the ideals of the ancient virtues.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9B_KFprdIwC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=viri+militaris&amp;lr=&amp;sig=rk1RIWIwMSTacuW-GzFbSDjFh4k#PPA67,M1 The Rhetoric of Gender Terms: 'man', 'woman', and the Portrayal of Character in Latin Prose.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern current claims Viriatus belonged to an aristocratic Lusitanian clan who were owners of cattle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cienciahoje.pt/index.php?oid=9319&amp;op=all Ciência Hoje]&lt;/ref&gt; For Cassius Dio, he did not pursue power or wealth, but carried on the war for the sake of military glory. His aims could then be compared to  pure Roman aristocratic ideals of that time: to serve and gain military glory and honor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QbvYv8UfuwMC&amp;pg=PA3-IA1&amp;dq=military+glory+roman&amp;lr=&amp;sig=Nvpo0B16ue_j_NEQ2Q7TqyQmTv8#PPA3-IA1,M1 Eric Orlin, ''Temples, Religion, and Politics in the Roman Republic.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Viriatus did not fight for war spoils or material gain, like common soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6dmMsgRaOIEC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;dq=Fighting+Techniques+of+the+Ancient+World&amp;lr=&amp;sig=WDGNetJHZ-6I5py7m9Nd1f5smLY#PPA293,M1 The Dynamic Society: Exploring the Sources of Global Change.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lusitanians honored Viriatus as their ''Benefactor'', (Greek: ''euergetes''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1193.html Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, page 85 (v. 2)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Savior'' (Greek: ''[[soter]]''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/3221.html Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, page 887 (v. 3)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416005506/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/3221.html |date=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; typically [[Hellenistic]] honorifics used by kings like the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rwFnYh9zkgAC&amp;pg=PT39&amp;dq=Silius+Italicus+regnator&amp;lr=&amp;sig=tEqfmPMiZVT5WwVe3-sanMCfP0w#PPT32,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors assert that he was probably from the ''Herminius Mons'' ([[Serra da Estrela]]), in the heart of Lusitania, (in [[central Portugal]]) or the [[Beira Alta (region)|Beira Alta]] region.

Most of his life and his war against the Romans are part of legend and Viriatus is considered the earliest Portuguese [[Folk hero|national hero]], given the fact that he was the leader of the confederate tribes of Iberia who resisted Rome. The historian [[Appianus]] of [[Alexandria]] in his book about Iberia (in the section ''Historia Romana'', Roman History), commented that Viriatus "killed numerous Romans and showed great skill".

=== The Viriatus of Silius Italicus ===
It has been argued that [[Silius Italicus]], in his [[epic poem]] entitled ''Punica'',&lt;ref&gt;Punica, Silius Italicus, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/silius/silius3.shtml Liber III] and [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/silius/silius10.shtml X]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pt/books?id=yQk-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA496&amp;lpg=PA496&amp;dq=viriatus+punica&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bqIIA1FsXB&amp;sig=042LvLWJpy61jEfQ-e0V2v-yTuY&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Byw4UO-LOO2V0QWGzIDwBQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=viriatus%20punica&amp;f=false Punica], [[German language|German]] edition in Latin of 1791&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a former Viriatus who would have been a contemporary of Hannibal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BHjeyyqJGUQC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=regnator+viriatus&amp;lr=&amp;sig=KXqsgyn2z2WUYjWMpID7jhbg5UE España Sagrada]&lt;/ref&gt; He is referenced as ''primo Viriatus in aeuo'', and was a leader of the [[Gallaeci]] and of the Lusitanians.

The historical Viriatus would be the one who received the title of ''regnator Hiberae magnanimus terrae'', the "magnanimous ruler of the Iberian land".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rwFnYh9zkgAC&amp;pg=PT39&amp;dq=Silius+Italicus+regnator&amp;lr=&amp;sig=tEqfmPMiZVT5WwVe3-sanMCfP0w#PPT39,M1 Lusitania: Historia y etnología]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conquest of Lusitania by Rome ==
[[File:Campañadeviriato.svg|250px|thumb|Map of Viriathus campaigns in Iberian Peninsula]]
In the 3rd century BC, [[Roman Republic|Rome]] started its conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The Roman conquest of Iberia began during the [[Second Punic War]], when the senate sent an army to Iberia to block [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] reinforcements from helping [[Hannibal]] in the [[Italian Peninsula]]. This began Roman involvement in 250 years of subsequent fighting throughout Iberia, resulting in its eventual conquest in 19 BC with the end of the [[Cantabrian Wars]]. The [[Lusitanian War]] is one of the most well documented episodes of the conquest.

Rome's dominion of Iberia met with much opposition. In 197 BC, Rome divided the southeastern coast of Iberia into two provinces, [[Hispania Citerior]] and [[Hispania Ulterior]], and two elected ''[[praetor]]s'' were assigned to command the [[Roman legion|legions]]. As with many other tribes of Iberia, the inhabitants of the Lusitanian [[Castro (village)|castros]], or ''citanias'', would have been granted  [[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrina]]  stipendiaria''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/1078.html Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.es/geocrit/sn/sn-146(002).htm ''Scripta Nova. Revista Electrónica de Geografía y Ciencias Sociales.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Civitas.html John Murray, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', London, 1875.]&lt;/ref&gt; but remaining an autonomous (Greek: αὐτονόμων) country through treaties (''foedus'').

Lusitania's rich land was praised by ancient authors. [[Polybius]]  in his ''Histories'', "speaking of the natural wealth of Lusitania [...], tells us that owing to the favorable climate both men and animals are very prolific, and the land is constantly productive."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/34*.html Polybius, ''Histories.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans charged the native tribes with heavy taxes: a fixed ''vectigal'' or land-tax, the ''tributum'' and a certain quantity of cereals.&lt;ref&gt;([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Provincia.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Taxes were not the only source of income; mine exploitation and peace treaties were a source of [[denarius]] as well as war spoils and war prisoners who were sold as slaves. The indigenous towns  had to deliver their own treasures to the Romans, which left them only with their yearly earnings to pay the taxes. Between 209 and 169 BC, the Roman army collected 4 tons of gold and 800 tons of silver looting the native tribes of the Iberian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnarqueologia-ipmuseus.pt/?a=2&amp;x=2&amp;i=31 Treasures of Portuguese Archaeology.]&lt;/ref&gt; The governors extorted as much as they could from the tribes. In 174 BC, when Publius Furius Philus was accused of paying very little for the cereals that Iberia was compelled to deliver to Rome, [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] defended the interests of the native tribes. The exploitation and extortion reached such an extreme degree in the provinces that Rome had to create a special tribunal and laws, like the [[Lex Calpurnia]] created in 149 BC. Also as part of the payment, a certain number of men were required to serve in the [[Roman army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://62.204.194.45:8080/fedora/get/bibliuned:ETFSerie2-656E660B-13C2-A1E8-097D-361668B2D001/PDF Raquel López Melero, ''Viriatus Hispaniae Romulus.'']&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/theodor-mommsen/the-history-of-rome-book-iv-407/page-24-the-history-of-rome-book-iv-407.shtml Theodor Mommsen, ''The History Of Rome, Book IV'' p.24.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revolts ===
The Lusitanians revolted first in 194 BC against the Romans. Iberia was divided between the tribes that supported Roman rule and the tribes that revolted against Roman rule, as they had been divided before by those who supported the Carthaginian or the Romans.

This period was  marked by  a number of broken treaties either by the Roman generals, or their senate, that would not ratify the treaties, or by the native people.

In 152 BC the Lusitanians made a peace agreement with [[Marcus Atilius]], after he conquered ''Oxthracae'', Lusitania's biggest city. In [[Roman law]], [[Peregrinus (Roman)|peregrini dediticii]] was the designation given to peoples who had surrendered themselves after taking up arms against the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0395.html Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The Ancient Library.]&lt;/ref&gt; The terms offered were such that, as soon as Atilius returned to Rome, they rebelled and broke the treaty. Then they attacked the tribes that were Roman subjects and that had sided with the Romans in helping to attack and plunder the Lusitanian towns. Possibly{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} the Lusitanians recovered some of the booty the Romans had divided with those tribes.

In 151 BC the Celtiberians who had become Roman allies, fearing the revenge of the rebels who considered them traitors, asked the Romans to punish the rebellious tribes who had broken out into war and that the [[Roman legion|legions]] should remain in Iberia to protect them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0234:book=35:chapter=2:section=1 Polybius, ''Histories. The Celtiberian Wars'', Book 35.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Massacre of the Lusitanians ====
The [[praetor]] of [[Hispania Ulterior]], [[Servius Sulpicius Galba (consul 144 BC)|Servius Sulpicius Galba]] commanded the [[Roman army|Roman troops]] in Iberia c.150 BC, and at the same time [[Lucius Licinius Lucullus (consul 151 BC)|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]] was appointed Governor of the [[Hispania Citerior]] and  commander of an army. In the year 151 BC, Lucullus  "being greedy of fame and needing money", made a peace treaty with  the ''Caucaei'', of the [[Vaccaei]] tribe, after which he ordered his men to kill all the tribe's adult males, of which it is said only a few out of 30,000 escaped.

Servius Sulpicius Galba joined forces with Lucius Licinius Lucullus and together started to depopulate Lusitania. While Lucullus invaded the country from the east, Galba  attacked it from the south. Unable to sustain a war on two fronts, the Lusitanian troops suffered several losses in engagements with the Romans. Fearing a long [[siege]] and the destruction the [[Roman siege engines]] would cause in their towns, the Lusitanians sent an [[embassy]] to Galba to negotiate a peace treaty, although for the Romans it would be perceived as the ''[[Dediticii|Deditio]] in dicionem '', the surrender. The Lusitanians hoped they could at least renew the former treaty made with Atilius. Galba received the Lusitanian embassy politely, and a peace treaty was agreed on the terms proposed by him. He commanded them to leave their homes and remain in open country. The Lusitanians probably lost their city and possessions and their land would have become ''Ager Publicus''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/seyffert/0020.html Seyffert, ''Dictionary of Classical Antiquities.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The conquest of a territory, unless it had been given special conditions, could imply the acquisition, by the Romans, of the conquered territory and all that it contained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-dgra/0047.html Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'', p. 40.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubi-erat-lupa.austrogate.at/hispep/public/record_card_1.php?page=3&amp;quicksearch=romanisierung&amp;rec=30118 His+ania Epigraphica. Tratado de rendición (deditio) de un pueblo lusitano a L. Caelius, Imp.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty turned out to be a trap, like the one Lucullus had prepared for the ''Caucaei''. When the unarmed Lusitanians, among them Viriathus, were gathered together by Galba to hand over their weapons and to be split into three groups (two of the points of the treaty that had been negotiated) and allocated to new lands, the trap was sprung. With the promise that they would be given new lands they waited unaware while Galba's army [[Investment (military)|surrounded]] them with a [[ditch]], to prevent them from escaping. Afterwards, [[Roman soldiers]] were sent in and began to massacre all the males of military age. The survivors are said to have been sold into slavery in [[Gaul]].

The relocation of an entire tribe, accompanied by slaughter or their reduction to the status of slaves was a punishment often inflicted on native populations who took part in revolts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fondosdigitales.us.es/public_thesis/214/11603.pdf ''El Poblamiento Turdetano en el Bajo Guadalquivir'', Publicación y difusión electrónica Universidade de Sevilla]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galba distributed a little of the plunder to the army and a little to his friends, the native tribes that sided with him, and kept the rest. This incited a massive rebellion, with the entire Lusitanian tribe mustering as they waged war for three years against Rome, but met with many failures.

Three years after the massacre, the rebellion was on the verge of defeat when Viriathus appeared and offered himself as leader. Through his understanding of Roman military methods he saved the rebel Lusitanians by a simple though clever escape plan. Viriathus became the leader of the Lusitanians and caused much grief to the Romans in revenge for the massacre of his people.

== The "War of Fire" ==
{{Campaignbox Roman conquest of Hispania}}
{{Main|Lusitanian War}}
{{cquote|''And, in fine, he carried on the war not for the sake of personal gain or power nor through anger, but for the sake of warlike deeds in themselves; hence he was accounted at once a lover of war and a master of war.'' ~ Cassius Dio}}

The war with Viriatus was called "War of Fire" by the  Greek historian [[Polybius of Megalopolis]]. Two types of war were carried on by Viriatus, ''[[War|bellum]]'', when he used a regular army, and ''[[latrocinium]]'', when the fighting involved small groups of combatants and the use of [[guerrilla]] [[Military tactics|tactics]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oDCdCtgtk-wC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=latrocinium+guerrilla&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Baj2udLNEN&amp;sig=Ue7dNu6KHfe7oMJHQSi5o6r9ygo#PPA41,M1 Thomas Grunewald, ''Bandits in the roman army. Guerrilla leaders as latrones.'']&lt;/ref&gt; For many authors Viriatus is seen as the model of the guerrilla fighter.

Nothing is known about Viriatus until his first feat of war in 149 BC. He was with an army of ten thousand men that invaded southern [[Turdetani]]a.

Rome sent the praetor [[Caius Vetilius]] to fight the rebellion. He attacked a group of Lusitanian warriors who were out foraging, and after killing several of them, the survivors took refuge in a place that was surrounded by the Roman army. They were about to make a new agreement with the Romans when  Viriatus, mistrusting the Romans, proposed an escape plan. The Lusitanians inflamed by his speech made him their new commander. His first act was to rescue the currently trapped resisting Lusitanians whom he took over command of. First by lining up for battle with the Romans, then scattering the army as they charged. As each way broke apart and fled in different directions to meet up at a later location, Viriatus with 1,000 chosen men held the army of 10,000 Romans in check by being in a position to attack. Once the rest of the army had fled, he and the thousand men escaped as well.  Having effectively saved all of the Lusitanians soldiers immediately fortified the loyalty of the people around Viriatus.

Viriatus organized an attack against Caius Vetilius in [[Tribola]]. Since the Romans were better armed, he organized guerrilla tactics and sprung imaginative ambushes. Charging with iron spears, tridents and roars, the Lusitanians defeated Vetilius by killing 4,000 out of 10,000 Troops including Vetilius himself. As a response, the Celtiberians were hired to attack the Lusitanians, but were destroyed. After that incident, the Lusitanians clashed with the armies of [[Gaius Plautius]], [[Claudius Unimanus]] and [[Gaius Negidius]], all of whom were defeated. During this period Viriatus inspired and convinced the [[Numantia|Numantine]] and some [[List of peoples of Gaul|Gauls]] to rebel against Roman rule.

To complete the subjugation of Lusitania, Rome sent [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus]], with 15,000 [[soldier]]s and 2,000 [[cavalry]] to strengthen [[Gaius Laelius Sapiens]] who was a personal friend of [[Scipio Aemilianus Africanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q98FAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=viriatus+qualities&amp;lr=#PPA37,M1 ''The book of versions. On friendship.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans lost most of these reinforcements in [[Ossuma]]. When Quintus Fabius risked combat again, he was totally defeated near what is today the city of [[Beja, Portugal|Beja]] in [[Alentejo]]. This defeat gave the Lusitanians access to today's Spanish territory, modern [[Granada (province)|Granada]] and [[Region of Murcia|Murcia]]. The results of Viriatus's effects as well as that of the [[Numantine War]] caused many problems in Rome, the most notable being a drop in Legion recruitment rates.

Learning of these events, Rome sent one of its best generals, [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus (consul 142 BC)|Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus]], to Iberia. Near [[Sierra Morena]], the Romans fell into a Lusitanian ambush. Viriatus did not harm the Romans and let the soldiers and Servilianus go. Servilianus  made a peace term that recognized the Lusitanian rule over the land they conquered.

=== The treaty ===
This agreement was ratified by the [[Roman Senate]] and Viriatus was declared "amicus populi Romani", ({{lang-el|Rhômaiôn philos}}), an ally of the Roman people. However, the peace brought by the treaty  displeased [[Quintus Servilius Caepio (consul 140 BC)|Quintus Servilius Caepio]], who got himself appointed  successor of his brother, Q. Fabius Maximus Servilianus, in the command of the army and administration of affairs in Iberia. In his reports to the Roman Senate he sustained that the treaty was in the highest degree dishonorable to Rome. [[Livy]] seemed to have a different opinion as he said it was a stain in Servilianus' military career but comments that the treaty was, ''aequis'', fair.&lt;ref name="livi"/&gt;  The senate authorized Q. Servilius Caepio, on his request, to distress Viriatus as long as it was done secretly. The treaty was in effect for one year. During that time Q. Servilius Caepio harassed Viriatus and kept making pressure with his reports until he was authorized to publicly declare war.

== Death ==
Knowing that the Lusitanian resistance was largely due to Viriatus' leadership, Quintus Servilius Caepio bribed [[Audax, Ditalcus and Minurus]], who had been sent by Viriatus as an embassy to establish peace ([[Appian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_spain_15.html#%A774 Appian's History of Rome: The Spanish Wars&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;). These ambassadors returned to their camp and killed Viriatus while he was sleeping. [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] claims  that when Viriatus' assassins asked Q. Servilius Caepio for their payment he answered that "it was never pleasing to the Romans, that a general should be killed by his own soldiers.",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/text4.html Eutropius, ''Abridgement of Roman History'', Book IV.]&lt;/ref&gt; or in another version more common in modern [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], "Rome does not pay traitors who kill their chief". Q. Servilius Caepio was refused his [[Roman triumph|Triumph]] by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].
[[Image:Madrazo Viriatus HighRes.jpg|thumb|300px|[[José de Madrazo]]'s painting of the death of Viriatus]]
After the death of Viriatus, the Lusitanians kept fighting under the leadership of [[Tantalus (Lusitanian)|Tautalus]] (Greek: Τάυταλος).

[[Laenas]] would finally give the Lusitanians the land they originally had asked for before the massacre. Nevertheless, total pacification of Lusitania was only achieved under [[Augustus]]. Under [[Hispania|Roman rule]], Lusitania and its people gradually acquired Roman culture and [[Latin|language]].

Viriatus stands as the most successful leader in Iberia who ever opposed the Roman conquest. During the course of his campaigns he was only defeated in battle against the Romans once, and from a military standpoint can be said to have been one of the most successful generals to have ever opposed Rome's expansion. Ultimately, even the Romans recognized that it was more prudent to use treachery rather than open confrontation to defeat the Lusitanian uprising. Some fifty years later, the renegade Roman general [[Quintus Sertorius]], at the head of another [[Sertorian War|insurrection in Iberia]], would meet a similar fate.

== Legacy ==
Viriatus became an enduring symbol of Portuguese nationality and independence, portrayed by artists and celebrated by its people throughout the centuries. In 1572, [[Luís Vaz de Camões]] epic poem [[Os Lusiadas]], the author exalts Viriatus' great deeds.

The flag of the Spanish province of [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], called Seña Bermeja, has 8 red strips honouring the eight victories of Viriatus over the Romans.

There is a street in Madrid named after him in Chamberí neighborhood.

===Film and television===
* The popular Spanish television series ''[[Hispania, La Leyenda]]'' which began in 2010 and ended in 2012, is based on his life and exploits.
* The History Channel's "[[Barbarians Rising]]" (2016) features the story of Viriatus in its first episode entitled "Resistance"

The '''Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council''' ('''WSSCC''') is a [[United Nations]] membership organization that advocates for improved [[sanitation]] and [[hygiene]] for the most vulnerable and marginalized people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/partners/wsscc/ |title=About WSSCC |publisher=Global Citizen |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; WSSCC facilitates multi-stakeholder collaboration around sanitation and contributes to the [[international community]]'s broader goals of poverty eradication, health and environmental improvement, gender equality and long-term social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwp.org/en/Our-approach/Strategic-Allies/WSSCC/ |title=Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC) |publisher=Global Water Partnership |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WSSCC's main areas of focus are large-scale sanitation and hygiene [[Behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]] programmes through the [[Global Sanitation Fund]] -promoting sanitation and hygiene as the gateway to inclusion and opportunity; and bringing together leaders and activists to strengthen the global sanitation movement.

WSSCC's members and staff lobbied for a [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] target for sanitation and hygiene. WSSCC contributes measurably to the achievement of SDG 6.2:  ''By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.'' 

==Scope==
WSSCC works to address the [[sanitation]] crisis and promote universal access to sanitation in collaboration with a range of partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/world-water-day-2013-ensuring-universal-access-to-water-and-sanitation |title=World Water Day 2013: Ensuring universal access to water and sanitation |publisher=Institute of Development Studies |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] estimates that 2.3 billion people live without access to safe sanitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/JMP-Update-report-2015_English.pdf |title=Progress on Sanitation and Drinking Water 2015 Update and MDG Assessment |publisher=WHO/UNICEF |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Bank]], poor sanitation costs countries approximately $260 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsp.org/content/economic-impacts-sanitation |title=Economics of Sanitation Initiative |publisher=Water and Sanitation Program |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

WSSCC addresses a range of sanitation and [[hygiene]]-related issues within its focus areas such as:

== Activities ==
WSSCC collaborates with government agencies, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, [[civil society]] groups and the private sector internationally and at the national, regional and local levels. Key collaborating partners include [[WaterAid]], the [http://sanitationandwaterforall.org Sanitation and Water For All], and [[UNICEF]], among others. The organization also advocates around key sanitation and hygiene international days such as [[World Toilet Day]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tapping into the Power of the Toilet|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-w-williams/tapping-the-power-of-the-toilet_b_8592332.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Global Handwashing Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Not Just Another Day|url = https://www.theguardian.com/wsscc-partner-zone/2015/oct/15/not-just-another-day|journal = The Guardian|date = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Sanitation Fund ===
{{Main|Global Sanitation Fund}}
Through the [[Global Sanitation Fund|Global Sanitation Fund (GSF)]], a multi-donor United Nations [[trust fund]], WSSCC supports national efforts to help rural communities improve their sanitation and adopt good hygiene practices. The GSF funds behaviour change activities. [[Community-led total sanitation]] is frequently utilized by GSF-funded national programmes, such as in Cambodia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/eapro/Community_Led_Total_Sanitation.pdf |title=Community-Led Total Sanitation in East Asia and Pacific  |publisher=UNICEF |date= |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women show the way in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)|url = http://www.trust.org/item/20140320171632-1j6lw/|website = Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GSF currently funds national programmes in [[Benin]], [[Cambodia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Madagascar]], [[Malawi]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Tanzania]], [[Togo]] and [[Uganda]]. WSSCC's Secretariat gathers funds and donations at the global level, selects the eligible countries for funding, and manages the disbursement of grants to national sanitation programmes.

=== Equality and non-discrimination ===
WSSCC advocates for equality, [[Right to water|human rights]] and non-discrimination as central to ensuring access to safe water supply, adequate sanitation and good hygiene for all. In particular, WSSCC WASH advocates promote women's participation and leadership&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Women Show the Way in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)|url = http://www.trust.org/item/20140320171632-1j6lw/|website = Thomson Reuters Foundation|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and menstrual hygiene management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The invention that aims to make periods less of a pain|url = https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/oct/02/menstruation-flo-periods-less-of-a-pain-for-girls-asia-africa/|website = The Guardian|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Disposable tampons aren't sustainable, but do women want to talk about it?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/27/disposable-tampons-arent-sustainable-but-do-women-want-to-talk-about-it|website = The Guardian|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = No Menstrual Hygiene For Indian Women Holds Economy Back|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-07-24/no-menstrual-hygiene-for-indian-women-holds-economy-back|website = Bloomberg|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Menstrual hygiene management ===
A key challenge that WSSCC is addressing relates to the inclusion of [[Menstrual hygiene day|menstrual hygiene management]] in the sustainable development agenda. WSSCC has highlighted that the [[Menstrual taboo|taboo]] surrounding [[menstruation]] is a barrier to equal participation and opportunities for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Opinion: Let’s Talk Menstruation. Period|url = http://www.ipsnews.net/2015/05/opinion-lets-talk-menstruation-period/|website = Inter Press Service|accessdate = 2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[National Public Radio]] article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/09/25/443103720/trying-to-add-the-m-word-menstruation-to-the-u-n-s-new-goals |title=Trying To Add The 'M' Word (Menstruation) To The U.N.'s New Goals |publisher=NPR|date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted that many policy makers often admit that they had never considered questions around menstruation before.

=== Other focus areas ===
Operationally, sustaining behaviour change as well as ensuring reliable and consistent monitoring have been identified as challenges. Of particular note is the challenge related to monitoring households that return to previous unhygienic behaviours. WSSCC and its partners are addressing these issues through systems strengthening&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsscc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Mada-15.pdf |title=Learning, progress and innovation: Sanitation and hygiene promotion in Madagascar |publisher=WSSCC |date= |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[impact evaluation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsscc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Evidence-Programme-on-Sanitation-and-Hygiene-web.pdf |title=The Evidence Programme on Sanitation and Hygiene |publisher=WSSCC |date= |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reports and campaigns ===
Notable reports and campaigns supported by WSSCC include:
* 'We Can't Wait', a report on sanitation and hygiene for women and girls produced in collaboration with WaterAid and [[Unilever]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wateraid.org/what-we-do/our-approach/research-and-publications/view-publication?id=a5ab0a96-1574-4225-a16a-75d5e5ec4232 |title=We Can't Wait |publisher=WaterAid, Unilever, WSSCC |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational structure==
WSSCC is administratively and legally hosted by UNOPS. The WSSCC Secretariat is governed by the WSSCC Steering Committee, and has three main departments: (i) Networking and Knowledge Management; (ii) [[Advocacy]] and Communications; (iii) the GSF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsscc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/global_sanitation_fund_progress_report_2014_web.pdf |title=Global Sanitation Fund Progress Report 2014 |publisher=WSSCC. p. 54 |date= |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WSSCC Steering Committee decides the policies and strategies of the organization, manages the governance process, and is accountable to both the membership and the donors for its work. It is made up of a chair, regional members, partner agency members, ex officio members, non-voting invitees, and permanent non-voting observers. All WSSCC members are eligible to stand and vote in elections for the Steering Committee. The interim Chairs are Brad Herbert and Ebele Okeke, who have been in post since November 2016. Previous Chairs were: [[Anna Tibaijuka]], 2011-2015; Roberto Lenton, 2005 – 2011; Sir [[Richard Jolly]], 1997 – 2004; and [[Margaret Catley-Carlson]], 1990 – 1996.

[[Amina J. Mohammed]], Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations and former Minister of Environment of Nigeria, served as WSSCC's Chair&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsghana.com.gh/amina-mohammed-to-chair-leading-wash-organization/ |title=Amina Mohammed to Chair Leading WASH Organization |publisher=News Ghana |date=2016-01-19 |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; from April 2016 to November 2016. 

The Secretariat’s Executive Director is Rolf Luyendijk, who will join WSSCC from UNICEF in March 2018. WSSCC’s secretariat is headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

===Funding===
The organization currently receives or has received funding from seven governments: [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfat.gov.au/aid/Pages/australias-aid-program.aspx |title=Australia's Aid Program |publisher=Australian Government Department of foreign Affairs and Trade |date= |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=49273&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US |title=Developmental Policy and Developmental Cooperation |publisher=Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland |date= |accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-foreign-affairs#ref-minbuza |title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs |publisher=Government of the Netherlands |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norway]], [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sida.se/English/ |title=Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency |publisher=Government of Sweden |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eda.admin.ch/sdc |title=Development and Cooperation |publisher=Government of Switzerland|date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development |title=Department for International Development |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|date= |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
In 1990, a group of senior staff of developing country governments, [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] and multilateral agencies, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and research institutions founded WSSCC. On December 21, 1990, the 45th Session of the UN General Assembly elected to pass resolution A/RES/45/181,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/45/a45r181.htm|title = A/RES/45/181. International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-17|website = |publisher = UN.org|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which emphasized the “importance of intensifying the coordination of national activities undertaken with the assistance of all relevant agencies in the field of water supply and sanitation through, in particular, the inter-agency Steering Committee for Co-operative Action for the International Drinking Water Decade and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council”. Through this resolution the WSSCC was formally established as an independent organization with a United Nations mandate.

During the 1990s, WSSCC concentrated on sharing knowledge and convening thematic discussion groups on water- and sanitation-related topics. In 2000, WSSCC published Vision 21,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ircwash.org/sites/default/files/WSSCC-2000-Vision.pdf|title = Vision 21: A Shared Vision for Hygiene, Sanitation and Water Supply and a Framework for Action|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-17|website = |publisher = IRC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a proposal for achieving universal water, sanitation and hygiene coverage.

WSSCC is an unincorporated membership organization and not a separate legal entity. From 1991 to 2009, it was hosted by the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]. Since 2010, WSSCC has been hosted by the [[United Nations Office for Project Services|United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://reliefweb.int/report/world/water-and-sanitation-body-completes-move-unops|title = Water and sanitation body completes move to UNOPS|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-17|website = |publisher = ReliefWeb|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 2000, WSSCC expanded its work to include advocacy and communications, and began to use the term "[[WASH]]" as an umbrella term for water, sanitation and hygiene from about 2001 onwards''.''&lt;ref&gt;Jong, D. de (2003) [http://www.ircwash.org/resources/advocacy-water-environmental-sanitation-and-hygiene Advocacy for water, environmental sanitation and hygiene - Thematic overview paper], IRC, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt; 

WSSCC's members and staff lobbied for a [[Millennium Development Goal]] target for sanitation, which was adopted at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002 in Johannesburg, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story097/en/|title = World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-18 |website = |publisher = WHO |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Since 2007, WSSCC has focused on sanitation and hygiene, adding a dedicated sanitation grant financing mechanism (the Global Sanitation Fund) in addition to its networking, knowledge and advocacy work.

The '''Wheat Price Guarantee Act''' was a 1919 bill passed by Congress that gave the government the power to regulate the price of wheat.

== Background ==
At the start of the first World War, the US government passed the [[Lever Food Act|Lever [Food] Act]]. This was done to conserve the food supply and increase its production in order to aid the efforts in Europe during the war. This alone helped food industries, including wheat, to take off. In July 1918, the Grain Corporation (a part of the [[U.S. Food Administration|US Food Administration]]) took on contracts with allied governments, promising to provide as much wheat up to 200 million bushels to the Allied powers. Soon after this, the war ended, and the United States had a decision to make if they were going to honor the wheat prices promised before the war ended. 
[[File:"They Are Giving All. Will You Send Them Wheat^ U.S. Food Administration.", ca. 1917 - ca. 1919 - NARA - 512442.jpg|left|thumb|260x260px|The US Food Administration used advertisements like this during World War I to urge people to conserve food in order to have enough for the soldiers. Despite the wheat industry being as mobilized as it was, there was always a constant demand for more to aid the war effort.]]
During [[World War I]], the wheat industry was mobilized, but following the end of it the demand started to decline, which hurt the still-mobilized agricultural industry. This resulted in the drafting of the Wheat Price Guarantee Act. The [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]] approved this and it was signed into law by [[Woodrow Wilson]]. The bill appropriated $1,000,000,000 in funds to keep wheat prices constant through the 1919-1920 crop year. The passage of this act allowed the US Government, specifically the President, to monitor wheat prices in order to guarantee farmers profits based on what they had formerly expected to be. The minimum price per bushel was set to $2.26, which is known as a guaranteed price scheme. The passage of this was intended to give the agricultural industry time to adjust to the war being over. The Wheat Price Guarantee Act would officially expire on June 1, 1920. After this, most farmers fell into debt and this laid some of the roots that would lead to the Great Depression in the 30's.

=== Gronna Bill ===
Senator Gronna attempted to reverse all guarantees within this act with the [[Gronna Bill]]. Many state representatives opposed this, choosing to back the farmers with a 100% guarantee on their profits. The bill did not end up passing in the end.

=== Wheat Prices ===
The passage of the bill required the US to buy bushels of wheat for at least $2.26 each. Following the expiration of the bill in 1920, prices plummeted back to their typical range of $0.50-$1.50 per bushel. Having lost most of the business they had because of the war, the wheat industry took a big hit. In 1931 during the [[Great Depression]], it would hit a low of just $0.33 per bushel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8582">'''Womankind Worldwide''' is a UK-based, feminist global women’s rights organisation that works in solidarity with women’s movements around the world to bring about lasting change in women’s lives. Founded in 1989, Womankind partners with women's movements in Africa and Asia to support them in their efforts to change discriminatory laws and policies, challenge gender norms and stereotypes, and provide transformative programmes and services to women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our impact|url=https://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/impact|website=Womankind Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly 30 years, Womankind, together with its partners, has supported over 18 million women and girls across more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our impact|url=https://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/impact|website=Womankind Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Founded by [[Sir Alec Reed]], Womankind was launched on [[International Women's Day]] on March 8th, 1989. Kate Young was appointed as Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Herstory|url=https://www.womankind.org.uk/about-us/history|website=Womankind Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 8th, 2019, the charity will celebrate its 30th anniversary.

==Approach==
Womankind does not have staff or offices in the countries where they work - instead, they support existing women's movements to strengthen and grow to support women's rights in their local and national contexts. Womankind does this by providing technical support, communications, connectivity and shared learning, advocacy platforms, and funding opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our approach|url=https://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/our-approach|website=Womankind Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with their partners, Womankind takes a three-pronged approach, working towards:
# Policies and laws that tackle discrimination and protect women,
# Universal access to appropriate, quality services that protect and restore women's rights, and
# Social change that supports the rights of all women and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our approach|url=https://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/our-approach|website=Womankind Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Womankind works with its partners in pursuit of three main aims:
# An end to all forms of violence against women and girls,
# Women's economic rights and control over resources, and
# Women's equal influence in decision making and ability to exercise political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|
title=Womankind's aims|url=https://www.womankind.org.uk/what-we-do/aims|website=Womankind Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus countries &amp; partners==
In 2016-2017, Womankind identified five focus countries on which to focus the majority of their work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impact Report 2016-17|url=https://www.womankind.org.uk/docs/default-source/Annual-Reports/womankind-worldwide-impact-report-2016-17.pdf?sfvrsn=4|website=Womankind Worldwide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

({{IPA-es|poɾˈke no te ˈkaʎas}}, English: "Why don't you shut up?") is a phrase that was uttered by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos I]] of [[Spain]] to [[Venezuela]]n President [[Hugo Chávez]], at the 2007 [[Ibero-American Summit]] in [[Santiago, Chile]], when Chávez was repeatedly interrupting Prime Minister of Spain [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]]'s speech. The phrase became an overnight sensation, gaining [[Cult following|cult status]] as a mobile-phone [[ringtone]]; spawning a [[domain name]]; a contest; T-shirt sales; a television program; and [[YouTube]] videos.

== Incident ==
At the meeting on 10 November 2007, Chávez repeatedly interrupted Zapatero to call Zapatero's predecessor, [[José María Aznar]], a "fascist" and "less human than snakes",&lt;ref name=ShutUpBBC&gt;{{cite news

Zapatero had earlier irritated Chávez by suggesting that Latin America needed to attract more [[foreign portfolio investment|foreign capital]] to combat its "chronic, deepening poverty", and claimed that Chávez's policies scared investors out of Latin America.&lt;ref name=ShutUpBBC /&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeRebuke&gt;{{cite news|author=Padgett, Tim|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1682967,00.html?imw=Y|title=Behind the King's Rebuke to Chávez|accessdate=14 November 2007|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=12 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115094835/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1682967,00.html?imw=Y|archivedate=15 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chávez's attacks became so strong that Zapatero rose to Aznar's defence, even though he had been severely critical of Aznar in the past. Zapatero pointed out that Aznar had been democratically elected and was "a legitimate representative of the Spanish people".&lt;ref name=ShutUpBBC /&gt;

Although organizers switched off Chávez's microphone, he continued to interrupt as Zapatero defended Aznar. Juan Carlos leaned forward, turned towards his fellow head of state, and said, "''¿Por qué no te callas?''" The king's rebuke received applause from the general audience.&lt;ref name=TimeRebuke /&gt; He addressed Chávez using the [[T–V distinction|familiar form of "you"]].  (In Spanish, ''tú'' and ''te'' are usually used in informal chat, among young people or when addressing close friends, family, or children, and can be perceived as insulting when used in other circumstances.)&lt;ref name=ShutUpBBC /&gt; Shortly thereafter, he left the hall, when Nicaraguan President [[Daniel Ortega]] accused Spain of intervention in his country's elections and complained about the presence of Spanish energy companies in Nicaragua.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.com/a3noticias/servlet/Noticias?destino=../a3n/noticia/noticia.jsp&amp;sidicom=si&amp;id=13286798|title=El Rey Don Juan Carlos a Hugo Chávez: "''¿Por qué no te callas?''"|accessdate=11 November 2007|publisher=[[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]]|date=11 November 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112090430/http://www.antena3.com/a3noticias/servlet/Noticias?destino=..%2Fa3n%2Fnoticia%2Fnoticia.jsp&amp;sidicom=si&amp;id=13286798|archivedate=12 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was unprecedented, as never before had the king displayed such anger in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idnoticia_PK=457570&amp;idseccio_PK=1007 |title=Nunca se había visto al Rey tan enfadado en público |author=Tabar, Carmen |publisher=El Periódico de Catalunya |date=10 November 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208073548/http://www.elperiodico.com/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=46&amp;idioma=CAS&amp;idnoticia_PK=457570&amp;idseccio_PK=1007 |archivedate=8 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the king, the incident was part of an ''[[Annus horribilis#Juan Carlos I of Spain|annus horribilis]]'' for the royal image, according to the Chilean newspaper ''[[La Nación (Chile)|La Nación]]''.&lt;ref name="La Nación"&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite news | url = http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20071115/pags/20071115203346.html | title = El 'annus horribilis' del Rey Juan Carlos | publisher = [[La Nación (Chile)]] | date = 15 November 2007 | accessdate = 17 February 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20121206025748/http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20071115/pags/20071115203346.html | archivedate = 6 December 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' analyzed the incident, arguing that it exposed "the unendingly complicated relations between Spain and [[Spanish Empire|its former colonies]]".&lt;ref name="Colonies"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/weekinreview/25romero.html|work=The New York Times|author=Romero, Simon|date=25 November 2007|title=When a Mother Country Tells Its Kid, 'Shut Up'|accessdate=26 February 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215071736/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/weekinreview/25romero.html|archivedate=15 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
After the events at the summit, Hugo Chávez made statements against King Juan Carlos I, questioning his democratic [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]], and whether he knew about and endorsed the attempted coup d'état in Venezuela in 2002. Chávez defended his accusations against Aznar, arguing that prohibiting criticism of an elected official such as Aznar would be similar to prohibiting criticism of Hitler. He stated that he would revise Venezuela's position towards Spain and increase surveillance of the activities of Spanish companies in Venezuela, where Spain had been the main investor and trade partner in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Chavez/carga/Rey/avisa/revisara/relaciones/Espana/elpepiesp/20071115elpepinac_2/Tes |work=El País |title=Chávez carga contra el Rey y avisa de que revisará las relaciones con España |date=15 November 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725171522/http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Chavez/carga/Rey/avisa/revisara/relaciones/Espana/elpepiesp/20071115elpepinac_2/Tes |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish government showed appreciation for the reaction of the king and for Zapatero's defense of the dignity of Spanish elected representatives like Aznar.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Moratinos/afirma/ultimo/debe/hacerse/llamar/embajador/consultas/elpepuesp/20071115elpepunac_3/Tes|work=El País|title=Moratinos afirma que "lo último que debe hacerse" es llamar al embajador a consultas|date=15 November 2007|accessdate=15 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016143632/http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Moratinos/afirma/ultimo/debe/hacerse/llamar/embajador/consultas/elpepuesp/20071115elpepunac_3/Tes|archivedate=16 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several days after the event, Chávez demanded an apology from King Juan Carlos and warned Spain that he would review diplomatic ties and take action against Spanish investments such as [[Grupo Santander|Banco Santander]] and [[Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria]] in Venezuela.&lt;ref name=ReconsiderTies /&gt; He accused the king of displaying the kind of
Spanish arrogance that led to Spain's ejection from South America at the hands of Venezuela's hero, [[Simón Bolívar]].&lt;ref name=ReconsiderTies&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/world/americas/15venez.html?ref=world|title=Chávez Threatens to Reconsider Venezuela's Ties With Spain|agency=Reuters|work=The New York Times|date=15 November 2007|accessdate=16 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101110226/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/world/americas/15venez.html?ref=world|archivedate=1 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish diplomats were concerned that Chávez may replace his socialism and attacks on "American Imperialism" with attacks on what he called "Spanish imperialism".&lt;ref name=FTConquer /&gt; Speaking about Venezuela's indigenous peoples, Chávez said of the Spanish, "They slit our people's throats and chopped them into little bits and left them on the outskirts of towns and villages – that was what the Spanish empire did here".&lt;ref name=FTConquer /&gt; The Spanish foreign ministry denied that the ''"¿Por qué no te callas?"'' incident was indicative of Spanish–Latin American relations.&lt;ref name=FTConquer /&gt; Some analysts say Chávez used such incidents to "fire up his support base among the majority poor at home with blunt language that played on their misgivings of rich countries' investments in Latin America".&lt;ref name=ReconsiderTies /&gt;

According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', it is uncertain which of the two men came out of the incident looking worse: "Chávez for his boorish lack of etiquette",&lt;ref name=BattleRoyal /&gt; or the king for insulting another leader. The king's words raised questions as the "200th anniversary of independence for the former Spanish colonies" approached.&lt;ref name=BattleRoyal /&gt; Several days after the incident, Venezuela's state-run television ran footage of Juan Carlos with [[Francisco Franco]]. The king was depicted as the dictator's lackey; but the fact that the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], which preserved the monarchy, had been approved by a referendum; and the key role played by the king in putting down an [[23-F|attempted military coup in 1981]], were not mentioned.&lt;ref name=BattleRoyal /&gt;

The king's outburst received divided reactions from other leaders. Brazil's President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] defended Chávez, while Peru's and El Salvador's presidents [[Alan García]] and [[Antonio Saca]] supported the king.&lt;ref name=BattleRoyal /&gt;

An editor for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' noted the "Spanish-speaking world has been abuzz about [this] verbal slapdown" and suggested that King Juan Carlos "should have asked the assembled heads of state: 'Why don't you speak up?'"&lt;ref&gt;Jackson Diehl, "Silencing Venezuela's President a Royal Task", 21 November 2007, syndicated in the ''[[Albuquerque Journal]]'', p. A9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==

=== Immediate ===
One week after the event, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] delivered a second rebuke in one week to Chávez from a king, when he reminded Chávez that oil should not be used as a tool for conflict. The remarks came minutes after Chávez called for [[OPEC]] to "assert itself as an active political agent" at the OPEC summit in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119532579754096997?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Chavez's OPEC Speech Spurs Rebuke From Saudi King|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=17 November 2007|accessdate=20 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507100343/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119532579754096997?mod=googlenews_wsj|archivedate=7 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a followup at the OPEC summit, ''[[Reuters]]'' wrote that "Spain's king cannot shut Chavez up but bladder can",&lt;ref name=Bladder&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKN1947231020071119|title=Spain's king cannot shut Chavez up but bladder can|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=19 November 2007|accessdate=20 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121110634/http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUKN1947231020071119|archivedate=21 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Chávez said to a throng of reporters at the OPEC summit, "For a while now, I have needed to go to the bathroom and I am going to pee ... Do you want me to pee on you?"&lt;ref name=Bladder /&gt;

Two weeks after the event, Chile's President [[Michelle Bachelet]] revealed that she had politely requested that Chávez abstain from making some statements at the summit, indicating frankly that she felt "let down" by the subsequent discussions at the OPEC meeting, considering the effect that the price of oil has on countries like Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercopress.com/vernoticia.do?id=11957&amp;formato=HTML|title=Bachelet also asked Chavez, (politely) to shut up|publisher=MercoPress|date=23 November 2007|accessdate=23 November 2007|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127141358/http://www.mercopress.com/vernoticia.do?id=11957&amp;formato=html|archivedate=27 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also just weeks after the incident, Chávez was "accused of breaking a protocol accord" with Colombia's [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez|President Álvaro Uribe]] and "exhaust[ing] his Colombian counterpart's patience by speaking out of turn once too often", formally ending Chávez's mediation in hostage negotiations with the Colombian [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) guerrilla group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hudson, Saul|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN2224925520071122?sp=true|title=Colombian mediation failure hurts talkative Chavez|agency=Reuters|date=22 November 2007|accessdate=23 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dialogue resumed later and the hostages were freed in January 2008.)
