'''Ali Baba''' is a large [[Impact crater|crater]] in the northern hemisphere of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].  Ali Baba was first discovered in ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images.  It is located at 55.1° North [[Latitude]], 22.3° West [[Longitude]] and is 39.2 kilometers across.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;  It is located near the craters [[Aladdin (crater)|Aladdin]] and [[Samad (crater)|Samad]].&lt;ref name="Se-2"/&gt;  Ali Baba has a large dome in its interior, suggesting the crater has undergone viscous relaxation.  The top of the dome even reaches higher than the crater rim.

This crater is named after [[Ali Baba]], the hero from the tale "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" in [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton's]] translation of ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]''.

'''Pierre Jacques Antoine Béchamp''' (October 16, 1816 &amp;ndash; April 15, 1908) was a French scientist now best known for breakthroughs in [[applied chemistry|applied]] [[organic chemistry]] and for a bitter rivalry with [[Louis Pasteur]].&lt;ref name="manchester-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Manchester KL |title=Antoine B&amp;eacute;champ: pere de la biologie. Oui ou non? |journal=Endeavour |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=68&amp;ndash;73 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11484677 |doi= 10.1016/S0160-9327(00)01361-2|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160932700013612}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Béchamp developed the [[Bechamp reduction|Béchamp reduction]], an inexpensive method to produce [[aniline|aniline dye]], permitting [[William Henry Perkin|Perkin]] to launch the [[synthetic dye|synthetic-dye]] industry.  Béchamp also synthesized the first [[organic arsenic]]al drug, [[arsanilic acid]], from which [[Paul Ehrlich|Ehrlich]] later synthesized [[salvarsan|the first chemotherapeutic drug]].  Béchamp's rivalry with Pasteur was initially for priority in attributing [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] to microorganisms, later for attributing the silkworm disease [[pebrine]] to microorganisms, and eventually over the validity of [[germ theory]].&lt;ref name="manchester-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manchester-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Manchester KL | year =2007 | volume = 103 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | journal = [[South African Journal of Science]] | issn = 0038-2353 | title = Louis Pasteur, fermentation, and a rival | url = http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0038-23532007000500008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Béchamp also disputed [[cell theory]].

Claiming discovery that the "molecular granulations" in biological fluids were actually the elementary units of life, Béchamp named them ''microzymas''—that is, "tiny enzymes"—and credited them with producing both enzymes and cells while "evolving" amid favorable conditions into multicellular organisms.  Denying that bacteria could invade a healthy animal and cause disease, Béchamp claimed instead that unfavorable host and environmental conditions destabilize the host's native microzymas, whereupon they decompose host tissue by producing pathogenic bacteria.  While cell theory and germ theory gained widespread acceptance, granular theories became obscure.  Béchamp's version, ''microzymian theory'', has been retained by small groups, especially in [[alternative medicine]].&lt;ref name="manchester-2007"/&gt;

== Life and career ==
Béchamp was born in [[Bassing]], France in 1816, the son of a miller. He lived in [[Bucharest]], Romania from the ages of 7 to 18 with an uncle who worked in the French ambassador's office. He was educated at the [[University of Strasbourg]], receiving a doctor of science degree in 1853 and doctor of medicine in 1856, and ran a pharmacy in the city. In 1854 was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, a post previously held by Louis Pasteur.&lt;ref name="manchester-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manchester-2007"/&gt;

In 1856, after receiving his medical degree, Béchamp took a position at the [[University of Montpellier]], where he remained until 1876 when he was appointed Dean of the Catholic Faculty of Medicine at [[Université Lille Nord de France]]. Béchamp's time in Lille was stormy, as his dispute with Pasteur led to efforts to have his work placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' (the index of books prohibited by the Catholic Church). Béchamp retired under this cloud in 1886, briefly ran a pharmacy with his son, and ultimately moved to Paris, where he was given a small laboratory at the [[Sorbonne]]. One of his students was [[Marie Louis Victor Galippe|Victor Galippe]], a physician who studied micro-organisms in plants and their role in human health. He died at the age of 91, his work having faded into scientific obscurity and Pasteur's version of germ theory dominant.&lt;ref name="manchester-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manchester-2007"/&gt; A brief obituary in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' noted that Béchamp's name was "associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall."&lt;ref name="bmj-obit"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[British Medical Journal]] | title = Obituary: Professor Bechamp | year = 1908 | volume = 1 | issue = 2471 | page = 1150 | pmc = 2436492 | doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2471.1150-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern day, Béchamp's work continues to be promoted by a small group of [[alternative medicine]] proponents (also known as [[germ theory denialism|germ theory denialists]]), including advocates of alternative theories of cancer,&lt;ref name=hess&gt;{{cite book|last=Hess|first=David J.|title=Can bacteria cause cancer?: alternative medicine confronts big science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KojMTlCdYCUC&amp;pg=PA76|year=1997|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=0-8147-3561-4|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; who dismiss Pasteur's germ theory and argue that Béchamp's ideas were unjustly ignored.&lt;ref name="manchester-2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manchester-2007"/&gt; They accuse Pasteur of plagiarising and then suppressing Béchamp's work, citing work such as Ethel Douglas Hume's ''Béchamp or Pasteur: A Lost Chapter in the History of Biology'' from the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hess/&gt;

'''Antonín Jan Frič''' (in German: Anton Johann Fritsch, June 30, 1832 – November 15, 1913) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[paleontologist]], [[biologist]] and [[geologist]], living during the [[Austria–Hungary]] era. Professor at the [[Charles University]] and later became director of the [[National Museum (Prague)|National Museum in Prague]]. He became famous for his contributions on the field of [[Permian|Permo]] - [[Carboniferous]] [[ecosystem]]s.

He also became known for finding fossils once attributed to [[dinosaur]]s - ''[[Albisaurus]] albinus'' and ''[[Ponerosteus]] exogyrarum'' and so far the only [[pterosaur]] known from the Czech Republic, ''[[Cretornis hlavaci]]''. The [[pterosaur]] was small with a wingspan of about 1.5 m and lived in the [[Turonian]].

The first true dinosaur known from the Czech Republic was discovered 90 years after Frič's death (in 2003). It is a small ornithopod of Cenomanian age.&lt;ref&gt;http://app.pan.pl/archive/published/app50/app50-295.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Fritsch received the [[Lyell Medal]] from the [[Geological Society of London]] in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Geological Society of London|day_of_week=Monday |date=24 February 1902 |page_number=6 |issue=36699| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="929">Arrhenius is an impact crater in the [[Eridania quadrangle]] on Mars at 40.3° S and 237.4° W. and is 129.0 km in diameter.  Its name was approved in 1973, and it was named after [[Svante Arrhenius]].&lt;ref&gt;http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/392&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence of previous glacial activity is evident in images.  There also appear to be branched channels just outside the crater.

'''Bittern''' ({{abbr|pl.|plural}} bitterns) is a bitter-tasting solution that remains after precipitation of [[halite]] (common salt) from [[brine]]s and/or seawater. It is rich in [[magnesium chloride]]s, [[sulfate]]s, [[bromide]]s, [[iodide]]s, and other chemicals present in the original waters.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite web|title=Bittern - Chemistry|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/bittern-chemistry|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Bittern has been extracted for a long time, at least several centuries. The Dutch chemist [[Petrus Jacobus Kipp]] experimented with saturated solutions of bittern. The term for the solution is a modification of "bitter".&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

== Uses ==
Bittern is used to culture ''[[Haloquadratum]]'' [[archaea]].{{why?|date=October 2016}} It is also used for extraction of [[Magnesium sulfate|Epsom salt]] and other mineral salts.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

The solution can furthermore be used in the production of [[potash]] and potassium salts.&lt;ref name=RSC&gt;{{cite journal|title=Production of pure potassium salts directly from sea bittern employing tartaric acid as a benign and recyclable K+ precipitant|journal=RSC Advances|date=12 August 2014|issue=65|doi=10.1039/C4RA04360J|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2014/RA/C4RA04360J#!divAbstract|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bittern is used as a coagulant added to [[soy milk]] for the production of [[tofu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tofu-as.com/english/tofu/howto/02.html Japan Tofu Association - Different production techniques result in Cotton (Momen) tofu and Silken (Kinugoshi) tofu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodsafetysite.com/consumers/faq/?m_knowledgebase_article=334 What is nigari?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impact ==
Bittern, when the product of salt production, appears to have no adverse effects on the environment. It comes from seawater and can safely be returned to the sea, although bitterns are sometimes used instead to produce [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=NZIC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Salt Recovery Process|url=http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/production/1H.pdf|website=nzic.org.nz|publisher=New Zealand Institute of Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Campaign for Science and Engineering (CaSE)''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that is the UK’s leading independent advocate for science and engineering.  It focuses on arguing for more research funding, promoting a high-tech and [[Knowledge economy|knowledge-based economy]], highlighting the need for top-quality science and maths education at all levels, and scrutinising the mechanisms by which government uses science and evidence.

==History==
The Campaign for Science and Engineering was founded as Save British Science (SBS) in January 1986. The organisation started out when 1,500 scientists banded together to pay for an advert in [[The Times]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/news-media/guest-blog/from-save-british-science-to-case-to-the-future.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  From 'Save British Science', to 'CaSE', to the future|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It called on the Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]] to 'Save British Science'. The organisation changed its name to the Campaign for Science and Engineering in 2005. 

==Structure==
CaSE is based in [[Gordon Square]], in [[Bloomsbury]], London. It receives its funding from over 100 member organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/membership/case-members.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  CaSE members|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which currently include companies such as [[AstraZeneca|Astra Zeneca]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Google]], and [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]]; universities such as the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]]; learned and professional societies such as the [[Royal Society of Biology]], [[Institute of Physics]] and [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]; trade unions such as [[Prospect (trade union)|Prospect]]; and charities including the [[Wellcome Trust]] and [[Cancer Research UK]]. CaSE also has a large number of individual members. 

CaSE employs a team of staff who are led by the Executive Director, currently Dr Sarah Main&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/about-us/case-team.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  CaSE Team|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It also has a Board of Directors who meet several times each year to discuss CaSE's strategy and set its campaigning priorities, as well as being responsible for governance and financial management of the organisation. Professor Graeme Reid is the current Chair of the Board.

==Activity==
CaSE focuses its activity in three priority areas; Education and Skills&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/resource/CaSE2015EducationandSkillsBriefing.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  UK Election 2015 - CaSE Education and Skills Briefing|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Investment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/resource/CaSE2015InvestmentBriefing.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  UK Election 2015 - CaSE Investment Briefing|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Evidence in Policymaking&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/resource/CaSE2015ScienceinGovernmentBriefing.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  UK Election 2015 - CaSE Science and Engineering in Government|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;, delivering independent analysis and recommendations for action in reports in these areas. Following the 2016 Brexit referendum, it has been a strong voice in the areas of immigration, collaboration and regulation which are of particular concern to the science and engineering sector&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/resource/caseimmigrationreport2016.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  Immigration: Keeping the UK at the heart of global science and engineering - CaSE|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2010, CaSE played a key role in the Science is Vital&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienceisvital.org.uk/|title=Science is Vital {{!}} No more Dr Nice Guy!|website=scienceisvital.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign, which lobbied against cuts to the UK science budget in the [[Comprehensive Spending Review]] of October that year. The science budget was frozen in the final review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/academics-celebrate-as-science-budget-frozen-2111748.html|title=Academics celebrate as science budget frozen|date=2010-10-20|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In 2017 CaSE called for increase in R&amp;D investment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/news-media/case-comment/reaching-3-percent.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  Reaching 3 percent|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the government subsequently committed to increasing spending to 2.4% of GDP by 2027. Other successes include lobbying for amendments to the HE and Research Bill in 2016.

CaSE holds regular meetings with representatives from its member organisations to inform its work, alongside sustained political engagement. This include meeting directly with [[Member of parliament|MPs]] and Peers, submitting evidence to [[Select committee|Select Committee]] Inquiries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/resource/Commons-S&amp;T-committee-post-Brexit-inquiry-submission.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  CaSE submission to Commons S&amp;T Committee post-Brexit inquiry|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and being invited to speak at conference and panel events. 

CaSE also holds an annual lecture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/engaging-with-policy/events/case-annual-lectures.html|title=CaSE {{!}}  CaSE Annual Lectures|last=CaSE|website=www.sciencecampaign.org.uk|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is given by prominent scientific or political figures including [[Jo Johnson]], then Universities and Science Minister, in 2016, Professor [[Ellen Stofan]], then NASA Chief Scientist in 2014, and Professor [[Anne Glover (biologist)|Anne Glover]] CBE, then EU Chief Scientific Advisor in 2013.

The '''''Cato Journal''''' is a triannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] which covers [[public policy]] from an [[Austrian School|Austro]]-[[libertarian]] point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mises.org/page/1429 |title=Austro-Libertarian movement journals |last=Block |first=Walter |authorlink=Walter Block |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=November 29, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023911/http://mises.org/page/1429# |archive-date=2013-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in 1981 and is published by the [[Cato Institute]]. It publishes articles discussing politics and economy. The journal is a "free-market, public policy journal ... for scholars concerned with questions of public policy, yet it is written and edited to be accessible to the interested lay reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cato Journal |url=http://cato.org/cato-journal/ |website=Journal homepage |accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[James A. Dorn]] (Cato Institute).

==History==
The journal was established in 1981, when two issues were published. The frequency of publication has been triannual since 1982, with the exception of volume 15 for 1995. In 2004/2005, the grouping together of issues into volumes switched from a Spring-Fall-Winter grouping to a Winter-Spring-Fall grouping, thereby synchronizing it with the [[calendar year]].&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/cato-journal/archives |accessdate=November 29, 2013 |title=Cato Journal Archives |publisher=[[Cato Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Does it Fart? ==
After a Twitter discussion about farting snakes (#[https://twitter.com/hashtag/doesitfart DoesItFart]), Rabaiotti partnered with Nick Caruso of the [[University of Alabama]] to crowd source a database of animal flatulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/scientists-are-drawing-up-a-list-of-farting-animals_uk_58765322e4b09642a34f2d11|title=Scientists Are Creating A Database Of Farting Animals|date=2017-01-11|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabaiotti told the Washington Post that “''Does it fart?'' is one of most frequent questions zoologists receive from kids".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2017/01/11/scientists-are-building-an-animal-fart-database/|title=Scientists are building an animal fart database|last=Bittel|first=Jason|date=2017-01-11|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair published an illustrated book with [[Quercus (publisher)|Quercus]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://london-nerc-dtp.org/2017/10/31/student-co-authors-popular-science-book-fart/|title=Student co-authors popular science book, "Does it Fart?" - The London NERC DTP|date=2017-10-31|work=The London NERC DTP|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1012165062|title=Does it fart? : the definitive field guide to animal flatulence|last=Dani,|first=Rabaiotti,|others=Caruso, Nick,|isbn=1786488272|location=London|oclc=1012165062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/nature/do-animals-fart-book|title=Do animals fart?|work=Science Focus|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discoverwildlife.com/animals/everything-you-need-know-about-animal-flatulence|title=Everything you need to know about animal flatulence {{!}} Discover Wildlife|website=www.discoverwildlife.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.menshealth.com/guy-wisdom/animals-that-fart-spreadsheet|title=Some Animals Don’t Fart, Say Scientists Whose Salaries Are Paid For By Your Taxes|date=2017-01-10|work=Men's Health|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/does-it-fart/dani-rabaiotti/nick-caruso/9781786488268|title=Does It Fart? by Dani Rabaiotti, Nick Caruso {{!}} Waterstones|website=www.waterstones.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">The '''Davies equation'''&lt;!--, named after [[?????? Davies]],--&gt; is an empirical extension of [[Debye–Hückel theory]] which can be used to calculate [[activity coefficient]]s of [[electrolyte]] solutions at relatively high concentrations at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. The equation, originally published in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Davies|first=C. W.|title=Ion Association| publisher=Butterworths| location=London| year=1962| pages=37–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; was refined by fitting to experimental data. The final form of the equation gives the mean [[molal]] activity coefficient &lt;math&gt;f_\pm&lt;/math&gt; of an electrolyte that dissociates into ions having charges ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of [[ionic strength]] ''I'':
[[File:ActivityCoefficientsDaviesEquation log.png|thumb|Semi-log plot of activity coefficients calculated using the Davies equation]]
[[File:ActivityCoefficientsDaviesEquation lin.png|thumb|Plot of activity coefficients calculated using the Davies equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;-\log f_\pm = 0.5 z_1 z_2\left(\frac{\sqrt I}{1 + \sqrt{I}} - 0.30 I \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The second term, 0.30&amp;nbsp;''I'', goes to zero as the ionic strength goes to zero, so the equation reduces to the Debye–Hückel equation at low concentration. However, as concentration increases, the second term becomes increasingly important, so the Davies equation can be used for solutions too concentrated to allow the use of the [[Debye–Hückel equation]]. For 1:1 electrolytes the difference between measured values and those calculated with this equation is about 2% of the value for 0.1 M solutions. The calculations become less precise for electrolytes that dissociate into ions with higher charges. Further discrepancies will arise if there is association between the ions, with the formation of [[ion pair]]s, such as Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Emma Dean''' is a small impact crater in the [[Meridiani Planum]] extraterrestrial plain situated within the [[Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle]] (MC-19) region of the planet [[Mars]]. This geological feature was visited by the [[Opportunity rover|''Opportunity'' rover]] from [[Timekeeping on Mars|sols]] 929 to 943. The much larger crater [[Victoria (crater)|Victoria]] lies about 100m to the east. 
Emma Dean lies directly on top of the ejecta blanket from Victoria and could therefore expose material originating from deep inside Victoria.
The crater is named after Emma Dean, [[John Wesley Powell]]'s wife and one of the boats in [[Grand Canyon]] Powell expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canyon-country.com/lakepowell/jwpowell.htm|title=The Story of MAJOR JOHN WESLEY POWELL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2006/0831_Mars_Exploration_Rovers_Update_Spirit.html|title=Spirit  Waits to Bust a Move, Opportunity on Final Leg to Victoria Crater|accessdate=2006-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bobspixels.com/kaibab.org/powell/powexp.htm|title=The GRAND CANYON Explorer,The Powell Expedition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorer 7''' was launched October 13, 1959 at 10:36&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time by a [[Juno II]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] to an orbit of 573&amp;nbsp;km by 1073&amp;nbsp;km and inclination of 50.27°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/media/spotlight/explorer7.html|title=50th Anniversary of Explorer 7 Launch|work=Space and Science Engineering Center|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to measure solar [[x-ray]] and [[Lyman-alpha]] flux, trapped [[Solar energetic particles|energetic particles]], and heavy primary [[cosmic ray]]s. Secondary objectives included collecting data on micrometeoroid penetration, molecular sputtering and studying the Earth-atmosphere heat balance.
[[File:Explorer 7 - cutaway.jpg|left|thumb|Cutaway of Explorer 7]]

Launch was originally scheduled for late September 1959, but the mission was delayed for a week after a Jupiter IRBM test on an adjacent pad failed shortly after liftoff, causing flying debris to hit Explorer 7's launch vehicle. However, the damage to the booster was minor and could be easily repaired.

Significantly, it also carried [[Verner Suomi|Verner Suomi's]] flat-plate [[radiometer]], improved with the help of [[Bob Parent (professor)|Robert Parent]], that took the first [[Earth radiation budget]] measurements from [[space]] and initiated the era of [[satellite]] studies of the [[climate]]. Using both satellite observations of the Earth's heat balance and [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] cooling rates measured by net flux radiosondes, Suomi established the important role played by clouds in absorbing radiated solar energy.  These observations established that Earth’s energy budget varies markedly due to the effect of clouds, the surface albedo, and other absorbing constituents.  Using these instruments, Suomi and his team discovered that the Earth absorbed more of the Sun's energy than originally thought and demonstrated that it was possible to measure and quantify seasonal changes in the global heat budget.

The satellite weighed 41.5&amp;nbsp;kg, was 75&amp;nbsp;cm high and 75&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Powered by [[solar cell]]s, it also carried 15 [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] around its equator.

It transmitted data continuously through to February 1961 and went dead on August 24, 1961. It is still in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usspaceobjectsregistry.state.gov/registry/index.cfm?fuseaction=home |title=U.S. Space Objects Registry |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030213556/http://usspaceobjectsregistry.state.gov/registry/index.cfm?fuseaction=home |archivedate=October 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[astronomy]], '''first light''' is the first use of a [[telescope]] (or, in general, a new instrument) to take an [[astrophotography|astronomical image]] after it has been constructed. This is often not the first viewing using the telescope; optical tests will probably have been performed in [[daylight]] to adjust the components. The first light image is normally of little scientific interest and is of poor quality, since the various telescope elements are yet to be adjusted for optimum efficiency. Despite this, a first light is always a moment of great excitement, both for the people who design and build the telescope and for the astronomical community, who may have anticipated the moment for many years while the telescope was under construction. A well-known and spectacular [[astronomical object]] is usually chosen as a subject.

For example, the {{convert|200|in|m|order=flip|adj=on|2}} [[Hale Telescope]] saw first light January 26, 1949, targeting [[NGC 2261]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://365daysofastronomy.org/2009/01/26/january-26-60th-anniversary-of-hale-telescope-first-light/ |title=January 26: 60th Anniversary of Hale Telescope "First Light" |publisher=365daysofastronomy.org |date=2009-01-26 |accessdate=2012-02-04 |last=Kardel |first=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of American astronomer [[Edwin Powell Hubble]].  The image was published in many magazines and is available on [http://archives-dc.library.caltech.edu/islandora/object/ct1%3A1160 Caltech Archives].

The [[Isaac Newton Telescope]] had two first lights: one in England in 1965 with its original mirror, and another in 1984 at La Palma island.&lt;ref name="ing"&gt;http://www.ing.iac.es/PR/chronology.html&lt;/ref&gt; The second first light was done with a video camera that showed the [[Crab Pulsar]] flashing.&lt;ref name=light&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rot6QG6G6bgC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=large+british+telescope&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LehzTLzmE4T68AannNTxCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=large+british+telescope&amp;f=false|title=New Scientist|first=Reed Business|last=Information|date=16 February 1984|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Large Binocular Telescope]] had its first light with a single primary mirror on October 12, 2005, which was a view of [[NGC 891]].&lt;ref&gt;http://medusa.as.arizona.edu/lbto/first_light.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202105302/http://medusa.as.arizona.edu/lbto/first_light.htm |date=December 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18115 |title=Large Binocular Telescope Successfully Achieves First Light |publisher=SpaceRef.com |date=2005-10-26 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second primary mirror was installed in January 2006 and became fully operational in January 2008.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7282385.stm |title= Giant telescope opens both eyes |accessdate=2008-03-06  | date=March 6, 2008 | location=London | work=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10.4 m [[Gran Telescopio Canarias]] had a first light image of Tycho 1205081 on 14 July 2007.&lt;ref name="backreaction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backreaction.blogspot.sg/2007/07/first-light-for-gran-telescopio.html|title=First Light for the Gran Telescopio Canarias|date=14 July 2007|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph|IRIS]] solar space observatory achieved first light on July 17, 2013.&lt;ref name=iris&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/iris-telescope-first-glimpse-of-suns-mysterious-atmosphere/index.html|title=IRIS Telescope's First Look at Sun Atmosphere|first=Holly|last=Zell|date=9 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[principal investigator|PI]] noted, "The quality of images and spectra we are receiving from IRIS is amazing. This is just what we were hoping for ..."&lt;ref name=iris/&gt;

== Cosmology ==
{{main|Population III star|Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|Chronology of the universe}}
In [[physical cosmology]], ''first light'' refers to the light emitted from the first generation of [[star]]s, known as [[population III star]]s, which formed within a few hundred million years after the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~rse/firstlight/ | title= Searching for first light in the Early Universe | first=Richard | last=Ellis | authorlink=Richard Ellis (astronomer) | accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These stars were the first source of visible light in the universe, apart from a brief period very early on, when it first became transparent and was briefly filled with a brilliant pale-orange [[color temperature|4000K glow]] during [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] and [[photon decoupling]], at about 377,000 years of cosmic time. However, the photons from decoupling only provided visible light for very few million years, since they were quickly [[redshift]]ed to infrared and then radio/microwave frequencies, by the [[expansion of the universe]]. The first stars were therefore the first occasion when the kind of light now seen, appeared in the universe.

In general, '''flux''' in [[biology]] relates to movement of a substance between compartments. There are several cases where the concept of flux is important.
* The movement of molecules across a membrane: in this case, flux is defined by the rate of [[diffusion]] or transport of a substance across a permeable [[biological membrane|membrane]].  Except in the case of active transport, net flux is directly proportional to the [[concentration]] difference across the membrane, the [[surface area]] of the membrane, and the membrane [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] constant.
* In [[ecology]], flux is often considered at the [[ecosystem]] level - for instance, accurate determination of [[carbon flux]]es using techniques like [[eddy covariance]] (at a regional and global level) is essential for modeling the causes and consequences of [[global warming]].
* [[Metabolic flux]] refers to the rate of flow of metabolites through a biochemical network, along a linear metabolic pathway, or through a single enzyme. A calculation may also be made of carbon flux or flux of other elemental components of biomolecules (e.g. nitrogen). The general unit of flux is chemical mass /time (e.g., micromole/minute; mg/kg/minute). Flux rates are dependent on a number of factors, including: enzyme concentration; the concentration of precursor, product, and intermediate metabolites; [[post-translational modification]] of enzymes; and the presence of metabolic activators or repressors. Metabolic flux in biologic systems can refer to biosynthesis rates of polymers or other macromolecules, such as proteins, lipids, polynucleotides, or complex carbohydrates, as well as the flow of intermediary metabolites through pathways. [[Metabolic control analysis]] and [[flux balance analysis]] provide frameworks for understanding metabolic fluxes and their constraints.

== Measuring movement==
Flux is the net movement of particles across a specified area in a specified period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mathbench.umd.edu/modules/cell-processes_diffusion/page03.htm|title=Measuring Movement Using Flux|website=mathbench.umd.edu|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particles may be ions or molecules, or they may be larger, like insects, muskrats or cars. The units of time can be anything from milliseconds to millennia. Flux is not the same as velocity or speed nor is it the same as density or concentration. Movement itself is not enough.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19063">In [[optics]], the '''Fraunhofer diffraction''' equation is used to model the [[diffraction]] of waves when the diffraction pattern is viewed at a long distance from the diffracting object, and also when it is viewed at the [[focal plane]] of an imaging [[Lens (optics)|lens]].&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins &amp; White, 1957, p288&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the diffraction pattern created near the object, in the [[Near-field region|near field]] region, is given by the [[Fresnel diffraction]] equation.

The equation was named in honor of [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] although he was not actually involved in the development of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Fraunhofer.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This article explains where the Fraunhofer equation can be applied, and shows the form of the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for various apertures.  A detailed mathematical treatment of Fraunhofer diffraction is given in [[Fraunhofer diffraction equation]].

==Equation==
{{main|Fraunhofer diffraction equation}}

When a beam of light is partly blocked by an obstacle, some of the light is scattered around the object, and light and dark bands are often seen at  the edge of the shadow – this effect is known as diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;Heavens and Ditchburn, 1996, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; These effects can be modelled using the [[Huygens–Fresnel principle]]. Huygens postulated that every point on a primary wavefront acts as a source of spherical secondary wavelets and the sum of these secondary wavelets determines the form of the wave at any subsequent time. [[Augustin-Jean_Fresnel|Fresnel]] developed an equation using the Huygens wavelets together with the principle of superposition of waves, which models these diffraction effects quite well.

It is not a straightforward matter to calculate the displacement given by the sum of the secondary wavelets, each of which has its own amplitude and phase, since this involves addition of many waves of varying phase and amplitude. When two waves are added together, the total displacement depends on both the [[amplitude]] and the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the individual waves: two waves of equal [[amplitude]] which are in phase give a displacement whose amplitude is double the individual wave amplitudes, while two waves which are in opposite phases give a zero displacement.  Generally, a two-dimensional integral over complex variables has to be solved and in many cases, an analytic solution is not available.&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, p. 425&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fraunhofer diffraction equation is a simplified version of the [[Kirchhoff's diffraction formula]] and it can be used to model the light diffracted when both the light source and the viewing plane are effectively at infinity with respect to the diffracting aperture.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins &amp; White, 1957, Section 15.1, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, the incident light is a [[plane wave]] so that the phase of the light at each point in the aperture is the same. The phase of the contributions of the individual wavelets in the aperture varies linearly with position in the aperture, making the calculation of the sum of the contributions relatively straightforward in many cases.

Strictly speaking, the Fraunhofer approximation only applies when the diffracted pattern is viewed at infinity, but in practice it can be applied in the [[Near and far field#Radiation zone, including radiating far field|far field]], and also in the focal plane of a positive lens.

===Far field===
{| align="right" class="infobox" style="font-size:12px; text-align:center;"

| '''Fraunhofer diffraction''' occurs when:
&lt;math&gt;\frac{W^2}{L\lambda} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; – aperture or slit size,
&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; – wavelength, 
&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; – distance from the aperture
|}

When the distance between the aperture and the plane in which the pattern is observed is large enough that the difference in the optical path length between the light from the extremes of the aperture is much less than the wavelength, then individual contributions can be treated as though they are parallel.  This is often known as the far field and is defined as being located at a distance which is significantly greater than {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/λ}}, where {{math|λ}} is the wavelength and {{math|''W''}} is the largest dimension in the aperture. The Fraunhofer equation can be used to model the diffraction in this case.&lt;ref&gt;Lipson, Lipson and Lipson, 2011, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a 0.5mm diameter circular hole is illuminated by a laser with 0.6μm wavelength, the Fraunhofer diffraction equation can be employed if the viewing distance is greater than 1000mm.

===Focal plane of a positive lens===

[[File:Lens and wavefronts rotated.gif|right|200px|thumb|Plane wave focused by a lens.]]A [[plane wave]] incident on a positive lens is focused at a point by the lens; all the '[[Ray (optics)#Definition|rays]]' have the same phase at the point of focus, so that this is equivalent to viewing the plane wave at infinity. Thus, if the diffracted light is focused with a lens, the observed diffraction pattern can be modelled using Fraunhofer diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; The diffracted light can be considered to be made up of a set of plane waves of varying orientation.  When a lens is located in front of the diffracting aperture, each plane wave is brought to a focus at a different point in the focal plane with the point of focus being proportional to the x- and y-direction cosines, so that the variation in intensity as a function of direction is mapped into a positional variation in intensity.  
==Examples of Fraunhofer diffraction==

In each of these examples, the aperture is illuminated by a monochromatic plane wave at normal incidence.

===Diffraction by a slit of infinite depth===

[[Image:Single_Slit_Diffraction_(english).svg|right|thumb|Graph and image of single-slit diffraction]]

The width of the slit is {{math|''W''}}. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is shown in the image together with a plot of the intensity vs. angle {{math|θ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, Figures 10.6(b) and 10.7(e)&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern has maximum intensity at {{math|θ [[=]] 0}}, and a series of peaks of decreasing intensity. Most of the diffracted light falls between the first minima. The angle, {{math|α}}, subtended by these two minima is given by:&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins &amp; White, 1957, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \approx {\frac{2 \lambda}{W}} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the smaller the aperture, the larger the angle {{math|α}} subtended by the diffraction bands.  The size of the central band at a distance {{math|''z''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d_f = \frac {2 \lambda z}{W}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, when a slit of width 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm is illuminated by light of wavelength 0.6&amp;nbsp;µm, and viewed at a distance of 1000&amp;nbsp;mm, the width of the central band in the diffraction pattern is 2.4&amp;nbsp;mm.

The fringes extend to infinity in the {{math|''y''}} direction since the slit and illumination also extend to infinity.

If {{math|W &lt; λ}}, the intensity of the diffracted light does not fall to zero, and if {{math|D &lt;&lt; λ}}, the diffracted wave is cylindrical.

====Semi-quantitative analysis of single-slit diffraction====
[[Image:single slit diagram.svg|100px|right|thumb|Geometry of single-slit diffraction]]
We can find the angle at which a first minimum is obtained in the diffracted light by the following reasoning. Consider the light diffracted  at an angle {{math|θ}} where the distance {{math|''CD''}} is equal to the wavelength of the illuminating light. The component of the wavelet emitted  from the point A which is travelling in the {{math|θ}} direction is in anti-phase with the wave from the point {{math|''B''}} at middle of the slit, so that the net contribution at the angle {{math|θ}} from these two waves is zero.  The same applies to the points just below {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, and so on.  Therefore, the amplitude of the total wave travelling in the direction {{math|θ}} is zero.  We have:

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_\text{min} \approx \frac {CD} {AC} = \frac{\lambda}{W}.&lt;/math&gt;

The angle subtended by the first minima on either side of the centre is then, as above:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 2 \theta_\text{min} = \frac{2\lambda}{W}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is no such simple argument to enable us to find the maxima of the diffraction pattern.

==== Single-slit diffraction of Electric Field using Huygen's Principle ====
[[File:Singleslithuygens.jpg|thumb|Continuous broadside array of point sources of length ''a''.]]
We can develop an expression for the far field of a continuous array of point sources of uniform amplitude and of the same phase. Let the array of length ''a'' be parallel to the y axis with its center at the origin as indicated in the figure to the right. Then the differential [[Electric field|field]] is:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books/about/Antennas_for_all_applications.html?id=NRxTAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Antennas for all applications|last=Kraus|first=John Daniel|last2=Marhefka|first2=Ronald J.|date=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780072321036|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;dE=\frac{A}{r_1}e^{j \omega [t-(r_1/c)]}dy=\frac{A}{r_1}e^{j(\omega t-\beta r_1)}dy&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta=\omega/c=2\pi /\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. However &lt;math&gt;r_1=r-ysin\theta&lt;/math&gt;and integrating from &lt;math&gt;-a/2&lt;/math&gt;to &lt;math&gt;a/2&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;E=A^'\int\limits_{-a/2}^{a/2} e^{j\beta y sin\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A^'=\frac{Ae^{j(\omega t-\beta r)}}{r_1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Integrating we then get

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{2A^'}{\beta sin \theta}sin(\frac{\beta a}{2}sin \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Letting &lt;math&gt;\psi^'=\beta a sin \theta = \alpha_r sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;where the array length in rad&lt;math&gt;a_r=\beta a=2\pi a/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, then,

&lt;math&gt;E=\frac{sin(\psi^'/2)}{\psi^'/2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Diffraction by a rectangular aperture===

[[File:Rectangular diffraction.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Computer simulation of Fraunhofer diffraction by a rectangular aperture]]The form of the diffraction pattern given by a rectangular aperture is shown in the figure on the right (or above, in tablet format).&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, Figure 8.10&lt;/ref&gt; There is a central semi-rectangular peak, with a series of horizontal and vertical fringes.  The dimensions of the central band are related to the dimensions of the slit by the same relationship as for a single slit so that the larger dimension in the diffracted image corresponds to the smaller dimension in the slit.  The spacing of the fringes is also inversely proportional to the slit dimension.

If the illuminating beam does not illuminate the whole length of the slit, the spacing of the vertical fringes is determined by the dimensions of the illuminating beam.  Close examination of the double-slit diffraction pattern below shows that there are very fine horizontal diffraction fringes above and below the main spot, as well as the more obvious horizontal fringes.

===Diffraction by a circular aperture===
[[File:Airy-pattern2.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Computer simulation of the Airy diffraction pattern]]The diffraction pattern given by a circular aperture is shown in the figure on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, Figure 8.12&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the [[Airy Disk|Airy diffraction pattern]]. It can be seen that most of the light is in the central disk. The angle subtended by this disk, known as the Airy disk, is

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \approx \frac {1.22 \lambda} {W}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''W''}} is the diameter of the aperture.

The Airy disk can be an important parameter in [[Angular resolution|limiting the ability]] of an imaging system to resolve closely located objects.

===Diffraction by an aperture with a Gaussian profile===

[[Image:Exp squared function.svg|right|200px|thumb|Intensity of a plane wave diffracted through an aperture with a Gaussian profile]] The diffraction pattern obtained given by an aperture with a [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] profile, for example, a photographic slide whose [[Transmittance|transmissivity]] has a Gaussian variation is also a Gaussian function. The form of the function is plotted on the right (above, for a tablet), and it can be seen that, unlike the diffraction patterns produced by rectangular or circular apertures, it has no secondary rings.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, Figure 11.33&lt;/ref&gt; This technique can be used in a process called [[apodization]]—the aperture is covered by a Gaussian filter, giving a diffraction pattern with no secondary rings.

The output profile of a single mode laser beam may have a [[Gaussian beam|Gaussian]] intensity profile and the diffraction equation can be used to show that it maintains that profile however far away it propagates from the source.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, Figure 13.14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diffraction by a double slit===
[[File:SodiumD two double slits 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Double-slit fringes with sodium light illumination]]
In the [[double-slit experiment]], the two slits are illuminated by a single light beam.  If the width of the slits is small enough (less than the wavelength of the light), the slits diffract the light into cylindrical waves. These two cylindrical wavefronts are superimposed, and the amplitude, and therefore the intensity, at any point in the combined wavefronts depends on both the magnitude and the phase of the two wavefronts.&lt;ref&gt;Born &amp; Wolf, 1999, Figure 7.4&lt;/ref&gt; These fringes are often known as [[Young's interference experiment|Young's fringes]].

The angular spacing of the fringes is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_\text{f} = \lambda/d.&lt;/math&gt;

The spacing of the fringes at a distance {{math|''z''}} from the slits is given by&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, 2002, eq. (9.30).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;w_\text{f} = z \theta_f = z \lambda/d,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''d''}} is the separation of the slits.

The fringes in the picture were obtained using the yellow light from a sodium light (wavelength = 589&amp;nbsp;nm), with slits separated by 0.25&amp;nbsp;mm, and projected directly onto the image plane of a digital camera.

Double-slit interference fringes can be observed by cutting two slits in a piece of card, illuminating with a laser pointer, and observing the diffracted light at a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;m.  If the slit separation is 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm, and the wavelength of the laser is 600&amp;nbsp;nm, then the spacing of the fringes viewed at a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;m would be 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Semi-quantitative explanation of double-slit fringes====

[[Image:Double slit.svg|thumbnail|right|300px|Geometry for far-field fringes]]
The difference in phase between the two waves is determined by the difference in the distance travelled by the two waves.

If the viewing distance is large compared with the separation of the slits (the [[far field]]), the phase difference can be found using the geometry shown in the figure.  The path difference between two waves travelling at an angle {{math|θ}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;d \sin \theta \approx d \theta.&lt;/math&gt;

When the two waves are in phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to an integral number of wavelengths, the summed amplitude, and therefore the summed intensity is maximal, and when they are in anti-phase, i.e. the path difference is equal to half  a wavelength, one and a half wavelengths, etc., then the two waves cancel, and the summed intensity is zero.  This effect is known as [[Interference (optics)|interference]].

The interference fringe maxima occur at angles

:&lt;math&gt;d \theta_n = n \lambda,\quad n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots,&lt;/math&gt;

where λ is the [[wavelength]] of the light. The angular spacing of the fringes is given by
 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_\text{f} \approx \lambda/d.&lt;/math&gt;

When the distance between the slits and the viewing plane is {{math|''z''}}, the spacing of the fringes is equal to {{math|''z''θ}} and is the same as above:

:&lt;math&gt;w = z\lambda/d.&lt;/math&gt;

===Diffraction by a grating===

[[File:Diffraction of laser beam by grating.jpeg|thumb|150px|Diffraction of a laser beam by a grating]] A grating is defined in Born and Wolf as "any arrangement which imposes on an incident wave a periodic variation of amplitude or phase, or both".

A grating whose elements are separated by {{math|''S''}} diffracts a normally incident beam of light into a set of beams, at angles {{math|θ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} given by:&lt;ref&gt;Longhurst, 1957, eq.(12.1)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;~ \sin \theta_n = n \lambda /S, n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2 ...... &lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the [[Diffraction grating|grating equation]]. The finer the grating spacing, the greater the angular separation of the diffracted beams.

If the light is incident at an angle {{math|θ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the grating equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \theta_n = \frac {n \lambda} {S} + \sin \theta_0, n=0, \pm1, \pm2.... &lt;/math&gt;

The detailed structure of the repeating pattern determines the form of the individual diffracted beams, as well as their relative intensity while the grating spacing always determines the angles of the diffracted beams.

The image on the right shows a laser beam diffracted by a grating into {{math|''n''}} = 0, and ±1 beams.  The angles of the first order beams are about 20°; if we assume the wavelength of the laser beam is 600&amp;nbsp;nm, we can infer that the grating spacing is about 1.8&amp;nbsp;μm.

====Semi-quantitative explanation====

[[Image:Beugungsgitter.svg|200px|thumb|right]] A simple grating consists of a series of slits in a screen. If the light travelling at an angle {{math|θ}} from each slit has a path difference of one wavelength with respect to the adjacent slit, all these waves will add together, so that the maximum intensity of the diffracted light is obtained when:

:&lt;math&gt;W \sin \theta = n \lambda, n=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, .....&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same relationship that is given above.

The '''Gravitational Wave International Committee''' (or GWIC) is a panel of [[Gravitational wave detector|gravitational wave detection]] Laboratory or Observatory directors that promotes cooperation and collaboration between the [[gravitational wave]] detector projects and provides direction and advice on the future development of the field. Barry Barish founded the GWIC in 1997 and served as the chair from 1997-2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GWIC Past Members|url=https://gwic.ligo.org/members/PastMembers.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of GWIC is to facilitate international collaboration and cooperation in the construction, operation and use of the major gravitational wave detection facilities worldwide:
*Promote international cooperation in all phases of construction and scientific exploitation of gravitational-wave detectors;
*Coordinate and support long-range planning for new instrument proposals, or proposals for instrument upgrades;
*Promote the development of gravitational-wave detection as an astronomical tool, exploiting especially the potential for multi-messenger astrophysics;
*Organize regular, world-inclusive meetings and workshops for the study of problems related to the development and exploitation of new or enhanced gravitational-wave detectors, and foster research and development of new technology;
*Represent the gravitational-wave detection community internationally, acting as its advocate;
*Provide a forum for project leaders to regularly meet, discuss, and jointly plan the operations and direction of their detectors and experimental gravitational-wave physics generally.

==Relationship to other Organizations==

GWIC is affiliated with the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) as its Working Group 11 (WG11).  In 1999, GWIC was adopted by an earlier IUPAP Working Group, the [http://www.iupap.org/wg/panagic/index.html Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics and Gravitation International Committee] (PaNAGIC). PaNAGIC was created to support international exchange of ideas and to support the convergence of the international scientific community with respect to large-scale activities on particle and nuclear astrophysics, gravitation and cosmology. It adopted GWIC as a sub-panel specializing in gravitational waves.  PaNAGIC was dissolved by IUPAP in 2011, but the important role of GWIC was recognized and it was promoted to full Working Group status.

GWIC also works with the [[International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation]] (ISGRG) in some areas.  ISGRG is an Affiliated Commission of IUPAP (designated AC2).  The main scientific meetings of GWIC (the Amaldi Meeting on Gravitational Waves) and ISGRG (the GRxx series of conferences) were held together in Sydney in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amaldi7.com/ http://www.amaldi7.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and will be held together again in Warsaw in 2013. The ISGRG also administers the GWIC Thesis Prize funds.  The membership of GWIC includes a representative from ISGRG to ensure communication between the two organizations.

==Activities==

===Amaldi Conferences on Gravitational Waves===

The [[Edoardo Amaldi]] [http://www.amaldi.org/ Conference series on Gravitational Waves] is 
coordinated by GWIC as the cornerstone conference for the 
Gravitational Wave Detection community worldwide.   These conferences 
are held every two years, and move around the world to locations 
where gravitational wave research is active.

===GWIC Thesis Prize===

GWIC awards a prize for an outstanding [[PhD]] thesis on any aspect of gravitational waves science. First awarded as a biennial award open to  [[LIGO]] Scientific Collaboration members, it is now an annual award open to the broader [[gravitational wave]] science field. A summary article of the research of past winners is found on the [http://www.2Physics.com 2Physics] blog [http://www.2physics.com/2010/07/deepest-all-sky-surveys-for-continuous.html].

===Roadmap===

In June 2010, GWIC released a document detailing a strategic roadmap for the gravitational wave astronomy field for the next 30 years [http://gwic.ligo.org/roadmap/Roadmap_100814.pdf]. This roadmap sets out recommended priorities for developing current projects and initiating new detectors based on scientific opportunities. The goal of the roadmap is to

:''serve the international gravitational wave community and its stake-holders as a tool for the development of capabilities and facilities needed to address the exciting scientific opportunities on the intermediate and long-term horizons.''&lt;ref&gt;Quote from  ''THE GRAVITATIONAL WAVES INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE ROADMAP, The future of gravitational wave astronomy.'' Retrieved September 19, 2010 from  http://gwic.ligo.org/roadmap/Roadmap_100814.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statements===

In order to aid funding agencies to see the significance of proposals (either continuing existing projects or initiating new projects),  GWIC may issue statements to indicate international support and consensus among the gravitational wave detection field. Statements or letters are issued if GWIC reaches a  strong consensus, and  "''such statements carry the full backing of the leaders of the projects represented on GWIC [http://gwic.ligo.org/statements/].''"

In 2010, GWIC released statements supporting the expansion of the interferometric detector network through the [http://gw-indigo.org/ IndIGO],&lt;ref&gt;''India set for building prototype gravitational wave detector'', by R. Ramachandran, The Hindu, September 19, 2010  http://www.hinduonnet.com/2010/09/19/stories/2010091962371500.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[LIGO]]-Australia, and [[LCGT]] projects.&lt;ref&gt;List of GWIC formal statements http://gwic.ligo.org/statements/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member Projects==

GWIC members are representatives from all established gravitational wave detector projects. Including ground- and space-based interferometric detectors, resonant mass detectors, spacecraft Doppler tracking and pulsar timing.  As of October 2012, the committee consists of 23 members from 15 projects or communities.

''' Greatness''' is a concept of a state of [[superior (hierarchy)|superiority]] affecting a [[person]] or [[Entity|object]] in a particular place or area. Greatness can also be attributed to individuals who possess a natural ability to be better than all others. The concept carries the implication that the particular person or object, when compared to others of a similar type, has clear advantage over others. As a descriptive term it is most often applied to a person or their work, and may be qualified or unqualified. An example of an expression of the concept in a qualified sense would be "[[Abraham Lincoln]] is the definition of greatness" or "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was one of the greatest wartime leaders". In the unqualified sense it might be stated "[[George Washington]] achieved greatness within his own lifetime", thus implying that "greatness" is a definite and identifiable quality. Application of the terms "great" and "greatness" is dependent on the [[world view|perspective]] and subjective judgements of those who apply them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basketball and philosophy|editor1=Jerry L. Walls |editor2=Gregory Bassham |editor3=Dick Vitale |author=Jerry L. Walls|chapter=The Wizard versus The General|pages=129|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2007|isbn=9780813124353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in some cases the perceived greatness of a person, place or object might be agreed upon by many, this is not necessarily the case, and the perception of greatness may be both fiercely contested and highly individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shonmehta.com/2014/01/which-one.html |title= Which One |publisher=shonmehta.com |date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in [[Europe]], rulers were sometimes given the attribute "the Great", as in [[Alexander the Great]], [[Frederick the Great]], and [[Catherine the Great]]. Starting with the Roman consul and general [[Pompey]], the [[Latin]] equivalent {{lang|la|[[Magnus]]}} was also used, as in Pompeius Magnus, [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Charlemagne|Carolus Magnus]].  The English language uses the Latin term {{lang|la|magnum opus}}, (literally "great work") to describe certain works of art and literature.

Since the publication of [[Francis Galton]]'s ''Hereditary Genius'' in 1869, and especially with the accelerated development of [[intelligence tests]] in the early 1900s, there has been a vast amount of social scientific research published relative to the question of greatness. Much of this research does not actually use the term ''great'' in describing itself, preferring terms such as ''eminence'', ''[[genius]]'', ''exceptional achievement'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, R.S. (ed) 1983.  ''Genius and Eminence: The Social Psychology of Creativity and Exceptional Achievement''. New York: Pergamon Press&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the major intellectual battles over this topic have focused around the questions of [[nature versus nurture]] or person versus context.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, D.K. 2009. ''Genius 101''. New York: Springer, e.g. Chs 4 &amp; 6&lt;/ref&gt; Today the importance of both dimensions is accepted by all, but disagreements over the relative importance of each are still reflected in variations in research emphases.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, H. 1995. ''Genius: The Natural History of Creativity''.  Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press vs Dorris. B. 2009. ''The Arrival of The Fittest: How The Great Become Great''.  (Lulu Url in Note 38 below)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetic approaches ==

The early research had a strong genetic emphasis and focused on intelligence as the driving force behind greatness.

=== ''Hereditary Genius'' – Galton (1869) ===

The earliest such research, ''Hereditary Genius'' by [[Francis Galton]] (1869), argued that people vary hugely in “natural ability” which is inherited biologically.  Those at the very top end of the range, i.e., geniuses, become the leaders and great achievers of their generation. To prove this thesis Galton collected data showing that genius clusters in what he termed “Notable Family Lines”, such as those of [[Bernoulli (disambiguation)|Bernoulli]], [[Cassini (disambiguation)|Cassini]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Herschel (disambiguation)|Herschel]], and [[Jussieu (disambiguation)|Jussieu]] in science, or [[Bach]] in music.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, D.K. 1994.  ''Greatness: Who Makes History and Why''.  New York: The Guilford Press, p10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Galton then calculated the odds of eminent people having eminent relations, taking into account the closeness of the biological connection (e.g., son vs grandson), and the magnitude of achievement of the eminent parent.  His findings were as anticipated: the more famous the parent (i.e., the greater level of presumed “natural ability”), the greater likelihood there would be illustrious relatives; and the closer the blood tie, the greater those odds.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Early Mental Traits of 300 Geniuses'' – Cox (1926) ===

[[Catharine Cox]]’s book on ''The Early Mental Traits of Three Hundred Geniuses'' (1926), was similar to Galton’s in its orientation.  Using the method that her mentor, Stanford Psychology Professor [[Lewis Terman]], had developed for differentiating children in terms of intelligence, Cox coded records of childhood and adolescent achievements of 301 historic eminent leaders and creators to estimate what their [[IQ]]s would have been on the basis of intellectual level of such achievements relative to the age at which they were accomplished.  For example, [[John Stuart Mill]] reportedly studied Greek at 3, read Plato at 7, and learned calculus at 11.  As such, what he was doing at 5, the average person couldn’t do until 9 years, 6 months of age, giving Mill an estimated IQ of 190.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p225&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox found that the perceived eminence of those with the highest IQs was higher than that of those attaining lower IQ estimates, and that those with higher IQs also exhibited more versatility in their achievements.  For example, [[da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Descartes]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Goethe]], and others with IQs in the mid 160s or above were superior in their versatility to those attaining lower scores, such as [[George Washington]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]], or [[Philip Sheridan]].&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p225-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Cox and Galton have been criticized for failing to take account of the role of nurture, or more specifically socio-economic and educational advantage, in the achievements of these historical greats.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p14-16, 227-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural approach ==

There was one major anthropological study of genius, and it was triggered specifically by the author’s contentions with Galton’s work.

=== ''Configurations of Cultural Growth'' – Kroeber (1944) ===
[[Alfred Kroeber]]’s ''Configurations of Cultural Growth'' (1944) looked at many of the same historic greats as did Galton and Cox, but from a completely different orientation.  As a cultural anthropologist, Kroeber maintained that, in Simonton's words, “culture takes primacy over the individual in any account of human (behavior), and that historic geniuses are no exception…” &lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p375-6&lt;/ref&gt;

To prove his thesis, Kroeber collected  “long lists of notable figures from several nationalities and historic eras”, and then grouped them within a field and a shared cultural context, e.g., “Configuration for American Literature”. Then within these groupings he listed his notables in “strict chronological order”, identifying the most eminent figures by using capital letters for their surnames (e.g. EMERSON, LONGFELLOW, POE, WHITMAN, etc. in above configuration).&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p376-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroeber found that genius never appeared in isolation, but rather, in Simonton's words, that “one genius cluster(ed) with others of greater and lesser fame in adjacent generations”.  He also found that there were historical “crests”  and “troughs” in every field.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p376&lt;/ref&gt;  These fluctuations in the appearance of genius were much too rapid to be explained by the simple mechanism of genetic inheritance along family lines.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p376. In Simonton's words, “the traits available in a population gene pool cannot fluctuate wildly in any short period…”  If genius were simply due to “inherited ability”, it would “be spread (much) more evenly from generation to generation”.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kroeber argued, in Simonton's words, that his  “configurations” were due to “emulations”:  “Geniuses cluster in history because the key figures of one generation emulate those in the immediately preceding generations… (until) it attains a high point of perfection that stymies further growth”.  At this point the “tradition degenerates into empty imitation, as most creative minds move on to greener pastures”.&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p376-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research is consistent with these explanations;&lt;ref&gt;Simonton, 1994, p378-82; Martindale, C. 1990. ''The Clockwork Muse: The Predictability of Artistic Change''. New York: Basic Books, pp69,70,73&lt;/ref&gt;  but many aspects of the developmental process from birth to the attainment of greatness remain unaccounted for by Kroeber’s anthropological approach.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, 1995, op cit, re central role of personality as trait; Dorris, 2009, op cit, re interactivity of genetics with interpersonal and socio-cultural factors over course of development&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developmental approaches ==

Retrospective studies, involving extensive interviews with individuals who have attained eminence, or at least exceptional levels of achievement, have added much to our understanding of the developmental process.  Two studies in particular stand out.

=== ''Scientific Elite'' – Zuckerman (1977) ===

[[Harriet Zuckerman]]’s ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States'', is based on many sources of research evidence, including a series of forty-one extended interviews with American winners of the [[Nobel Prize]] for science.

Zuckerman reported her results around two main topics: How the Prize is Awarded, and Career Development of the Scientific Elite.  Her findings on the first topic are briefly overviewed in the Wikipedia article regarding the [[Nobel Prize]]

In relation to the question of the career development of the scientific elite
Zuckerman uses the phrase "accumulation of advantage" to describe her findings.  In her words: “Scientists who show promise early in their careers (are) given greater opportunities in the way of research training and facilities.  To the extent that these scientists are as competent as the rest or more so, they ultimately will do far better in terms of both role performance and reward… rewards (which) can be transformed into resources for further work.. (and hence over time) scientists who are initially advantaged gain even greater opportunities for further achievement and rewards.”&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, H. 1977. ''Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States''. New York: The Free Press. pp61, 248&lt;/ref&gt;

To see if ‘accumulation of advantage’ was operating in the career development of the scientific elite, Zuckerman compared the careers of future laureates with those of “members of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] and the scientific rank and file” along a number of dimensions including socioeconomic origins, status of undergraduate and graduate education, the process of moving into the scientific elite, and first jobs and professorships.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, 1977, pp63-89, 144-52&lt;/ref&gt;

She also interviewed forty-one Nobel laureates extensively about their "apprenticeships" to "master" scientists while they were doing their doctoral research, and other aspects of their career development related to the above topics.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, 1977, pp122-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuckerman concluded that evidence of "accumulative of advantage" was clearly present over the course of development, with result that her research “… cast(s) considerable doubt on the conclusion that marked differences in performance between the ultra-elite and other scientists reflect equally marked differences in their initial capacities to do scientific work”.&lt;ref&gt;Zuckerman, 1977, p250&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Developing Talent in Young People'' – Bloom ''et al'' (1985) ===

[[Benjamin Bloom]] and five colleagues conducted extensive interviews with 120 “young men and women (as well as their parents and influential teachers)… who had reached the highest levels of accomplishment” in six fields – Olympic sprint swimmers, Top 10 rated professional tennis players, concert pianists, accomplished sculptors, exceptional mathematicians, and outstanding research neurologists.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S. (ed). (1985). ''Developing Talent in Young People''. New York: Ballantine Books. p4, backcover&lt;/ref&gt;

They report many findings relevant to the “talent development process", including:

*Development was tied throughout to the values, interests, resources, and personal investments of the family of origin. In most families “introduction to the field and initial… skill development occurred” because the “(p)arents (or other family members), in pursuing their own interests, created situations that intrigued, interested, or involved the child…  The child’s interest was rewarded or encouraged…” and the parents then provided other ways to extend this interest.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 1985, pp221-4, 448.  Albert, R. S. (1980) Family position and the attainment of eminence: a study of special family position and special family experience. ''Gifted Child Quarterly, 24'', 87-95, refers to such families as "eminence producing families"&lt;/ref&gt;
*The “[[work ethic]]” is central to talent development.  It is developed by “the home environment” and “…directly related to learning and participation in the chosen talent field”.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 1985, op cit, pp 508 &amp; ch12.&lt;/ref&gt;
*“Each group of parents strongly encouraged their children’s development in a particularly highly approved talent field (related to the parents’ own “special interests”) and gave much less support to other possible talent fields and activities.”&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 1985, pp445-6, 508&lt;/ref&gt;
*“Families and teachers were crucial at every point along the way to excellence…  what families and teachers do at different times and how they do it clearly sets the stage for exceptional learning in each talent field”.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 1985, p509, chs 11 &amp; 12&lt;/ref&gt;
*“Few… (of the) individuals (included in this study) were regarded as child prodigies”; and, as a result, this research “raises (serious) questions about earlier views of special gifts and innate abilities as necessary prerequisites of talent development”.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, 1985, p3, 533&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent approaches ==


A 1995 book by Hans Eysenck argues that a “personality trait” called [[Psychoticism]] is central to becoming a creative genius; and a more recent book by Bill Dorris (2009) looks at the influence of “everything from genetics to cultural crises”, including chance, over the course of development of those who attain greatness.

[[Hans Eysenck]]'s book, ''Genius: The Natural History of Creativity'' (1995), "construct(s)... a model of genius and creativity" whose "novelty lies in (its) attempt to make personality differences central to the argument".&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, 1995, op cit, p279&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular Eysenck is interested in a personality trait called “psychoticism … chief among (whose) cognitive features is a tendency to ''over-inclusiveness'', i.e., an inclination not to limit one's associations to ''relevant'' ideas, memories, images, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, 1995, p8&lt;/ref&gt;

He considers a massive range of experimental psychological research in order to establish the underlying genetic, neuro-chemical mechanisms which may be operating to influence levels of creativity associated with fluctuations in “the tendency towards over-inclusiveness indicative of psychoticism..."&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, 1995, pp279-80, ch7&lt;/ref&gt;

Eysenck's assessment of his overall argument is as follows: "There is no hint that the theory is more than a suggestion of how many disparate facts and hypotheses can be pulled together into a causal chain, explaining… the apogee of human endeavour - genius.  If the theory has one point in its favour it is that every step can be tested experimentally, and that many steps have already received positive support from such testing." &lt;ref&gt;Eysenck, 1995, p8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Arrival of The Fittest'' - Dorris (2009) ===
{{Self-published|section|date=August 2013}}
Bill Dorris's book, ''The Arrival of The Fittest: How The Great Become Great'' (2009), attempts to address a number of issues which remain unanswered on the subject. These include the role of chance over the course of development, the importance of the development of unique personal characteristics to achieving greatness, and the influence of changes in the wider worlds surrounding the person - from interpersonal to societal - on the course of an individual's development.&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009, op cit, p7, 10-12, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorris argues that those who attain ‘greatness’ are credited with solving a key generational problem in a field and/or society (e.g., [[Einstein]] resolving the conflict between [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] in physics at the outset of the 20th century; or [[Woody Guthrie]] providing a voice for the outcasts of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s).&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009, pp83-4; Online Case Studies at: http://homepage.eircom.net/~wdorris/greatnesscasestudies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorris’s core argument is that those who become ‘great’ start out with sufficient genetic potential and then are able, over two or more decades, to obtain matches/fits with “the right kind of problems” to extend the development of these genetic biases into what Dorris terms, “key characteristics”. These are the intellectual, personality, and self characteristics which eventually turn out to be required to solve a key generational problem in their field and/or society.&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009, op cit, pp10-12, 24-5, 86-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorris argues that there are four types of matching processes which occur over the course of such development. These refer to matches between the developmental needs of the person and the opportunities and resources essential to engaging in problem solving activities that stimulate further development of those aspects of intelligence, personality, and self which eventually become key characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009, pp24-5, 86-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of these matching processes are covered extensively in the existing research literature: continuous matching and cumulative matching.&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009, pp26-9, 31-6; Bloom, 1985, op cit; Zuckerman, 1977, op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

The other two of the matching processes described by Dorris are completely new to this book: catalytic matching and chaotic matching.

Dorris’s argument in relation to catalytic matching is that anyone who eventually becomes a ‘great’ will have experienced one or more sustained periods of exceptionally accelerated development of their key characteristics, accelerations which serve massively to differentiate them from their former peers in terms of both development and visibility within the field.

This acceleration occurs because the person becomes the focal point (star) of a self-reinforcing system of expertise and resources (catalytic system) which thrives off this person’s accelerated development and visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009, op cit, pp36-45, 138-44&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorris's argument in relation to chaotic matching is that access to the resources and learning opportunities essential to the development of key characteristics of an eventual ‘great’ often occurs not due to the efforts/planning of the individual, but simply due to chance events in the interpersonal, institutional or societal worlds around the person, who (unlike perhaps millions of equally capable peers) becomes the beneficiary of these chance events – events which Dorris argues can change a person’s entire future in much the same way as a lottery jackpot or a ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' ticket.&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009, pp49-67, 163-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorris documents his theoretical arguments with extensive case studies of a wide range of individuals, including [[Einstein]], [[Elvis]], [[Monet]], [[Mozart]], [[da Vinci]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]], basketball great [[Bill Russell]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and [[Marilyn Monroe|Norma Jeane/Marilyn Monroe]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorris, 2009; Online Case Studies at: http://homepage.eircom.net/~wdorris/greatnesscasestudies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''grid.org''' was a website and online community established in 2001 for [[cluster computing]] and [[grid computing]] software users.  For six years it operated several different [[volunteer computing]] projects that allowed members to donate their spare computer cycles to worthwhile causes.  In 2007, it became a community for [[Open-source model|open source]] cluster and grid computing software. After around 2010 it redirected to other sites.

== Volunteer computing projects ==

=== Cancer Research Project ===
[[Image:United Devices.PNG|thumb|250px|UD Agent running the LigandFit software for Cancer Research phase 2.]]
The United Devices Cancer Research Project, which began in 2001, was seeking possible drugs for the treatment of [[cancer]] using [[distributed computing]].&lt;ref name="bbc-cancer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1255804.stm|title=Screensaver aids cancer fight|publisher=BBC News|date=2001-04-03|accessdate=2006-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were around 150,000 users in the United States and 170,000 in Europe along with hundreds of thousands more in other parts of the world.

The project was an alliance of several companies and organisations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/cancer/participants.htm|title=Cancer Project Participants|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132915/http://grid.org/projects/cancer/participants.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Donors of molecular research

United Devices released the cancer research [[screensaver]] under the principle of using spare computing power. The program, which could be set to run continually, used "virtual screening" to find possible interactions between molecules and target proteins, i.e. a drug. These molecules ([[ligand]]s) are sent to the host computer's UD Agent. When these molecules dock successfully with a target protein this interaction is scored for further investigation.

The research consisted of two phases:

* Phase 1 tested over 3 billion drug-like molecules against 12 proteins which were known to be suitable targets for anti-cancer drugs. It used the "THINK" software for the simulation of the molecular interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/cancer/thinkcalculations.html|title=Think phase 1 computation|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827052411/http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/cancer/thinkcalculations.html|archivedate=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Phase 2, using the "LigandFit" software developed by [[Accelrys]] to model interactions, sought to refine the Phase 1 data to produce a more manageable list of drug candidates for testing that would require experimental collaborators, including some from industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/cancer/ligandfit.htm|title=LigandFit explained|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927140054/http://grid.org/projects/cancer/ligandfit.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/cancer/phaseii.html|title=Phase 2 of the Project|publisher=University of Oxford|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924201756/http://www.chem.ox.ac.uk/cancer/phaseii.html|archivedate=2006-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human Proteome Folding Project, phase 1 ===
{{main|Human Proteome Folding Project}}
The [[IBM]]-sponsored ''Human Proteome Folding Project'' ("HPF"), phase 1, was announced on November 16, 2004 and was completed July 3, 2006.  The project operated simultaneously on both grid.org and the IBM's [[World Community Grid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/hpf/about.htm|title=About The Human Proteome Folding Project|publisher=grid.org|year=2004|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623043412/http://www.grid.org/projects/hpf/about.htm|archivedate=2007-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It made use of the "Rosetta" software to predict the structure of human proteins in order to help predict the function of proteins.  This information may someday be used to help cure a variety of diseases and genetic defects.

According to an announcement on the grid.org forums,&lt;ref name="Grid.org Status 10 Jul 2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.grid.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=19636|title=Grid.org Status|date=2006-07-10|publisher=grid.org forums|first=Robby|last=Brewer|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206020142/http://forum.grid.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=19636|archivedate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the HPF1 project was completed it was left to continue running on grid.org until August 9, 2006.&lt;ref name="Take responsibility"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.grid.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=19709|title=Take responsibility|date=2006-07-17|publisher=grid.org forums|accessdate=2006-08-20}}{{deadlink|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During that time, members whose computers were configured to run this project got new work and spent computing resources calculating a result, but the result was returned to grid.org for points only—it was not used for scientific research.

The status of the Human Proteome Folding Project caused some discussion on the grid.org forums. Most members wanted to see all available computing power directed toward the still-active cancer project,&lt;ref name="Take responsibility"/&gt; but UD representative Robby Brewer asserted that "some [users] like the screensaver".&lt;ref name="Grid.org Status 10 Jul 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.grid.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=19928|title=Grid.org status|date=2006-08-21|publisher=grid.org forums|first=Robby|last=Brewer|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206020132/http://forum.grid.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?t=19928|archivedate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted above, in the end the redundant HPF1 work on grid.org was halted.&lt;ref name="Take responsibility"/&gt;

=== Smallpox Project ===
The ''Smallpox Research Grid'' was a part of United Devices "Patriot Grid" initiative to fight biological terrorism.  This project helped analyze potential drug candidates for a medical therapy in the fight against smallpox virus. It made use of the "LigandFit" software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the [[smallpox]] virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/smallpox/about.htm|title=About The Smallpox Project|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132908/http://grid.org/projects/smallpox/about.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partners of the project included [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Western Ontario]], [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center]], [[Essex University]], [[Evotec OAI]], [[Accelrys]], and [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/smallpox/participants.htm|title=Smallpox participants|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132857/http://grid.org/projects/smallpox/participants.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Community Grid]] largely began because of the success of this project.{{Citation needed |date= November 2013}}

=== Anthrax Project ===
The ''Anthrax Research Project'' was a part of the United Devices "Patriot Grid" initiative to fight biological terrorism.  It made use of the "LigandFit" software (that had already been used by phase 2 of the Cancer Research project), but with a specialized set of target molecules that targeted the advanced stages of [[anthrax]] bacterial infection.

The project was operated from January 22, 2002 until February 14, 2002 and ended after a total of 3.57 billion molecules had finished screening.  The results of the research project were transmitted to biological scientists in order to finish the screening of the computational simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/anthrax/index.htm|title=The Anthrax Research Project|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910233817/http://grid.org/projects/anthrax/index.htm|archivedate=2006-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partners of the project included [[Oxford University]].

=== HMMER Project ===
The [[HMMER| HMMER Genetic Research]] project made use of the [[Hidden Markov model]] to search for patterns in genetic DNA sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/hmmr/|title=Genetic Testing with HMMR|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927140045/http://grid.org/projects/hmmr/|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Webload Project ===
The ''Web Performance Testing'' project was operated as a commercial opportunity with select [[web hosting]] providers in order to help them test the scalability of their server infrastructures under periods of high-demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.org/projects/web_test/|title=Web Performance Testing|publisher=grid.org|accessdate=2006-08-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132846/http://grid.org/projects/web_test/|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open source grid community ==
In November 2007, grid.org was repositioned by [[Univa]] as a community to allow users to interact and discuss open source cluster and grid related topics.&lt;ref name="from2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grid.org/about-grid-org |title=About grid.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120042413/http://www.grid.org/about-grid-org |archivedate=January 20, 2008 |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It allowed users to download, get support for, contribute to, and report issues about the open source [[Globus Toolkit]] based products offered by Univa.
Over 100,000 unique visitors were reported in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Grid.org Open Source HPC Community Hits Growth Milestone |work=Press release |publisher=Univa |date=January 14, 2009 |url=http://www.grid.org/content/gridorg-open-source-hpc-community-hits-growth-milestone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121052235/http://www.grid.org/content/gridorg-open-source-hpc-community-hits-growth-milestone |archivedate=January 21, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around mid 2010 it redirected to Unicluster.org (a Univa product) and by 2012 it redirected to Univa's main site.

{{For|generic article about heuristics|Heuristic}}

In [[engineering]], '''heuristics''' are experience-based methods used to reduce the need for calculations pertaining to equipment size, performance, or operating conditions.  Heuristics are fallible and do not guarantee a correct solution. It is important to understand their limitations when applying them to different equipment and processes.  Though heuristics are limited, they may be of value.   This is because they offer time-saving approximations in preliminary process design.

Problem solving methods are intrinsic to [[forensic engineering]] methods, where failures are analysed for the [[root cause]] or causes. Only when failures have been investigated with conclusive results can remedial action be taken with confidence.

==Examples==
===Storage Vessels===
These heuristics were taken from Turton's "Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes".&lt;ref&gt;Turton, Richard, et al. (2003) ''Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes'', Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-064792-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Use vertical tanks on legs when the tank is less than 3.8 m³.
*Use horizontal tanks on concrete supports when the tank is between 3.8 and 38 m³, 
*Use vertical tanks on concrete pads when the tank is beyond 38 m³,
*Liquids subject to breathing losses may be stored in tanks with floating or expansion roofs for conservation.
*Freeboard is 15% below 1.9 m³ and 10% above 1.9 m³.
*Thirty-day capacity often is specified for raw materials and products, but depends on connecting transportation equipment schedules.

===[[Pumps]]===
These heuristics were taken from Turton's "Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes".&lt;ref&gt;Turton, Richard, et al. (2003) ''Analysis, Synthesis, and Design of Chemical Processes'', Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-064792-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Centrifugal pumps: Single Stage: for of 0.057-18.9 m³/min, 152 m maximum head. Multistage: for 0.076-41.6 m³/min, 1675 m maximum head.  Efficiency is 45% at 0.378 m³/min, 70% at 1.89 m³/min, 80% at 37.8 m³/min.
*Axial pumps: for 0.076-378 m³/min, 12 m head, 65-85% efficiency.
*Rotary pumps: for 0.00378-18.9 m³/min, 15,200 m head, 50-80% efficiency.
*Reciprocating pumps: for 0.0378-37.8 m³/min, 300&amp;nbsp;km head maximum.  Efficiency is 70% at 7.46 kW, 85% at 37.3 kW, and 90% at 373 kW.

'''''Information and Communication Technology for CCEA GCSE''''' ({{ISBN|0-340-88309-X}}) is a textbook by [[Dominican College, Portstewart|Gerry Lynch]] and [[Siobhan Matthewson]] aimed specifically at the [[CCEA]] [[GCSE]] in ICT.  It was published by [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton|Hodder Murray]] in 2005.

== Fundamental Errors ==
Despite being endorsed by [[CCEA]] and having been written by a pair of experienced examiners (as stated on the back cover), the book contains a number of basic errors.  The list below is not exhaustive, but provides a representative sample.  It is not known if the errors are on the part of the authors or editors.
* '''Cache''' (page 126): there is a confusion between the high-speed variant on [[RAM]], known as [[CPU cache]], and the [[hard disk]] [[web cache]] used by a [[web browser]] 
* '''Internet''' (page 160): the book states 'The Internet is a WAN'.  The [[English Wikipedia]] article on the [[Internet]] makes it clear that the Internet is not a single WAN but a collection of [[Wide Area Network|WANs]]
* '''MSN''' (page 179): while [[MSN]] is a collection of internet services, the book confuses this with the [[Microsoft Messenger service]] formerly known as MSN Messenger service.  It states: "Microsoft designed MSN for instant messaging"
* '''Scanners''' (page 130): a confusion is shown between an [[image scanner]] and a [[3D scanner]].
* '''USB Bar''' (page 165): in the context, this probably refers to a [[USB flash drive]], however apart from this text the term is unknown.
* '''Magnetic tape''' (page 136): it is claimed that [[Magnetic Tape]], in the context of data storage is the same as [[Digital Audio Tape]], which is not strictly correct, as the Wikipedia articles show.
* '''Netscape Navigator''':  Netscape Navigator is described as a popular web browser, which it had not been for several years before the book was printed.  At the time or printing, Internet Explorer had approx 60%-70% of market share and Firefox around 30%-40%.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8408">The '''Interactive Mathematics Program (IMP)''' is a four-year, problem-based mathematics curriculum for high schools. It was one of several curricula funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and designed around the 1989 [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics| National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)]] [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics|standards]].  The IMP books were authored by Dan Fendel and Diane Resek, professors of mathematics at [[San Francisco State University]], and by Lynne Alper and Sherry Fraser. IMP was published by Key Curriculum Press in 1997 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wu|first=H.|title=Review of IMP|url=http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/IMP2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sold in 2012 to It's About Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keycurriculum.com/about/press|title=Press|work=Key Curriculum Press Release|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107044839/http://www.keycurriculum.com/about/press|archivedate=2012-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Designed in response to national reports pointing to the need for a major overhaul in mathematics education,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309039770/html/] ''Everybody Counts: A Report to the Nation on the Future of Mathematics Education'', Mathematical Sciences Education Board, National Research Council, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309041872] ''Reshaping School Mathematics: A Philosophy and Framework for Curriculum'', Mathematical Sciences Education Board, National Research Council, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project2061.org/publications/sfaa/online/sfaatoc.htm] ''Science for all Americans'', American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; the IMP curriculum is markedly different in structure, content, and [[pedagogy]] from courses more typically found in the high school sequence.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction and Implementation Strategies for the Interactive Mathematics Program: A Guide for Teacher-Leaders and Administrators'', Key Curriculum Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

* Each book of the curriculum is divided into five- to eight-week units, each having a central problem or theme. This larger problem is intended to serve as motivation for students to develop the underlying skills and concepts needed to solve it, through solving a variety of smaller related problems.
* There is an emphasis on asking students to work together in [[collaborative learning|collaborative groups]]. 
* It is hoped that communication skills will be developed; exercises aimed at this goal are embedded throughout the curriculum, through the use of group and whole class discussions, the use of writing to present and clarify mathematical solutions; in some IEP classes, formal oral presentations are required.
* The IMP curriculum expects students to make nearly daily use of a scientific [[graphing calculator]].

== Debate ==
Nearly every one of these distinctive characteristics has generated controversy and placed the IMP curriculum right in the middle of the “[[math wars]],” the conflict between those that favor more traditional curricula in mathematics education and the supporters of the reform curricula that were largely an outgrowth of the 1989 [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics|NCTM standards]]. 

IMP is among the reform curricula that have been heavily criticized by organizations such as [[Mathematically Correct]]. That organization’s Internet site begins with a statement that “advocates of the new, fuzzy math” (focus) “on things like [[calculator]]s, blocks, guesswork, and group activities and they shun things like [[algorithm]]s and repeated practice. The new programs are shy on fundamentals and they also lack the mathematical depth and rigor that promotes greater achievement.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128152658/http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/ |date=2011-11-28 }} Mathematically Correct, www.mathematicallycorrect.com&lt;/ref&gt; Former NCTM president Frank Allen states, “Trying to organize school mathematics around problem solving instead of using its own internal structure for that purpose … (is destroying) essential connections….”&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathematicallycorrect.com/allen1.htm] Allen, F: “A Critical View of NCTM Policies with Special Reference to the Standards Reports” on mathematicallycorrect.com, last retrieved April 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism often includes anecdotal evidence including stories of school districts that have decided to discontinue or supplement use of the IMP curriculum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homework-desk.com/blog/kids_math_basics/] "Does kid's math have go to basics?”&lt;/ref&gt; and of students who did not feel they had been prepared adequately for college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathematicallycorrect.com/impsf.htm] Datta, S: “Interactive Mathematics Program: Manifesto on an Experimental Concept Gone Awry” on mathematicallycorrect.com, last retrieved April 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  "Regular math is much better, it makes much more sense," says Aimee Lynn Stearns, a student at Taos High School in Taos, New Mexico.

On the other hand, some IMP students describe the program in positive terms.  "It's fun, but it makes you really think," according to Ziouck Gonzalez, a student at Wells High School in Chicago, Illinois.  Looking beyond student response, IMP was one of five mathematics education programs designated "exemplary" by the US Education Department in 1999, for "outstanding quality and demonstrated effectiveness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_puca/is_199910/ai_2981414283] "Expert Panel Selects Exemplary, Promising Mathematics Programs," US Education Department Press Release, October 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It's About Time, the publisher of IMP, points out “the IMP first edition was published after more than 10 years of research, pilot testing, evaluating, field testing, revising, and detailed reviewing.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathimp.org/downloads/IMPWhitePaper.pdf] “Research Supporting the Interactive Mathematics Program”&lt;/ref&gt;  

Supporters point to statistical studies that compare the performance of students enrolled in IMP courses with their peers enrolled in traditional high school mathematics courses. Merlino and Wolff, two such researchers, report that in their several studies IMP students consistently outperformed traditionally taught students on both the math and verbal sections of the [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]], as well as on the SAT-9.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gphillymath.org/StudentAchievement/Reports/SupportData/Part1Intro.htm] Merlino, J. and Wolff, E: ''Assessing the Costs/Benefits of an NSF “Standards-Based Secondary Mathematics Curriculum on Student Achievement'', Philadelphia, PA: The Greater Philadelphia Secondary Mathematics Project, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer reported that grade 12 IMP students in his study performed better on all areas of mathematics tested by the NAEP test,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lmt.mspnet.org/media/data/IMP_block.pdf?media_000000002049.pdf] Kramer, S: “The Joint Impact of Block Scheduling and a Standards-Based Curriculum on High School Algebra Achievement and Mathematics Course Taking” (doctrinal dissertation), University of Maryland, 2003 [DEAD LINK]&lt;/ref&gt; and Webb and Dowling reported IMP students performed significantly better on statistics questions from the Second International Mathematics Study, on mathematical reasoning and problem solving tasks designed by the State of Wisconsin, and on a quantitative reasoning test developed by a university to administer to entering students.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, N. and Dowling, M: “Comparison of IMP Students with Students Enrolled in Traditional Courses on Probability, Statistics, Problem Solving, and Reasoning,” ''Project Report 97-1'', University of Wisconsin – Madison, Wisconsin Center for Education Research, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37531">The '''list of Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad''' comprises a list of [[antiquities]] and [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] held by various museums and other institutions in the [[People's Republic of China]], which the Chinese government has officially prohibited, since 2003, from being taken abroad for exhibition. Many of the relics on the list symbolize the breakthrough of [[archaeological]] discoveries that were made in China since the mid-20th century, when archaeology as a modern science began to take root in China.  These items are among the most important excavated treasures in China, and have a particular historical, cultural or artistic significance.

In June 2012, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage announced the second batch of 37 cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad, covering paintings and works of [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wenbao.net/wbw_admin/news_view.asp?newsid=2788 |script-title=zh:第二批禁止出国(境)展览文物目录(书画类)  |language=Chinese|date=11 June 2012 |access-date=3 February 2015 |publisher=State Administration of Cultural Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, a third batch of 94 items were announced, most of which are treasures excavated at archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinanews.com/cul/2013/08-19/5180173.shtml |script-title=zh:94件一级文物列入"第三批禁止出境展览文物目录" |language=Chinese |date=19 August 2013 |access-date=3 February 2015 |publisher=Chinanews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government regulations prohibiting exhibition abroad==
According to Article 49 of the ''Regulations for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Protection of Cultural Relics'' ([[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] Decree No.377) promulgated on 18 May 2003:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The only existing or fragile relics among the grade-one relics are prohibited from being taken out of the country for exhibition.  The catalogue of cultural relics prohibited from being taken out of the country for exhibition shall be made public on a regular basis by the competent cultural relics administrative department of the State Council.&lt;ref name="sach-2007-10-29"&gt;{{Citation | title=Regulations for the Implementation of the Law of the People's Republic of China on Protection of Cultural Relics | url=http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/311/InfoID/384/Default.aspx | publisher=State Administration of Cultural Heritage | date=29 October 2007 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319225933/http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/311/InfoID/384/Default.aspx | archivedate=19 March 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zwgk-2005--05-23"&gt;{{Citation | title=中华人民共和国文物保护法实施条例 | url=http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2005-05/23/content_153.htm | publisher=The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China | date=23 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A first list of sixty-four cultural relics that are forbidden to be exhibited abroad was published by the [[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] on 19 January 2002 (a year before the above regulation was enacted).&lt;ref name="sach-2008-12-29"&gt;{{Citation | title=中国文物事业改革开放30年 | url=http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/787/InfoID/15989/Default.aspx | publisher=State Administration of Cultural Heritage | date=29 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the list of items explicitly prohibited from being exhibited abroad, cultural relics that fall within one of the following five categories are also prohibited from being exhibited outside of China:&lt;ref name="sach-2007-10-28"&gt;{{Citation | title=文物出境展览管理规定 | url=http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/314/InfoID/6230/Default.aspx | publisher=State Administration of Cultural Heritage | date=28 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ancient human remains
* the main object of reverence at a place of religious observation
* first-grade cultural relics that are unique and easily damaged
* objects listed in the catalogue of cultural relics that are prohibited from being exhibited abroad
* cultural relics that are not suitable to be exhibited abroad because of their state of preservation

The '''Manned Orbiting Laboratory''' ('''MOL'''), originally referred to as the '''Manned Orbital Laboratory''', was part of the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[manned spaceflight]] program, a successor to the cancelled [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]] military reconnaissance space plane project. The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of manned [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].

The MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as a manned platform to prove the utility of man in space for military missions.&lt;ref name="press release"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program.&lt;ref name=Astro&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/astrospies/program.html |title=NOVA: Astrospies |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B  was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=249}}

MOL was cancelled in 1969, during the height of the [[Apollo program]], when it was shown that unmanned [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.

In the 1970s, the [[Soviet Union]] launched three [[Almaz]] military space stations, similar in intent to the MOL, but cancelled the program in 1977 for the same reasons.

==Planned operations==
The MOL was planned to use a [[Heliox|helium-oxygen]] atmosphere. It used a Gemini B spacecraft as a reentry vehicle.

The crew were to be launched using a [[Titan 3M]] with the stacked Gemini B and MOL, and returned to Earth in the Gemini B. They would conduct up to 40 days of military reconnaissance using large optics, [[camera]]s, and side-looking [[radar]].

The [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit]] (AMU) was developed for the MOL project.  NASA chief astronaut [[Deke Slayton]] later speculated in his autobiography that the AMU may have been developed for MOL because the Air Force "thought they might have the chance to inspect somebody else's satellites."{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=174}}

In response to the announcement of the MOL, the [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]]. Three Almaz space stations flew as [[Salyut]] space stations, and the program also developed a military add-on used on [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |title=The Almaz program |work=Russian Space Web |accessdate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000112/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |title=Almaz |work=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Mark |last=Wade |accessdate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119184429/http://astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |archivedate=19 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Almprog/almprog.htm |title=The Almaz Space Station Program |work=Sven's Space Place |first=Sven |last=Grahn |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gemini B==
The Gemini capsule was redesigned for MOL and named Gemini B. Externally it was similar to Gemini, but featured a rear hatch for the crew to enter MOL and many specific systems.

Gemini B would be launched with the MOL space station. Once in orbit, the crew would power down the capsule and activate MOL. After about one month of space station operations, the crew would return to the Gemini B capsule, separate from the station and perform reentry. Gemini B had an autonomy of about 14 hours once detached from MOL.&lt;ref&gt;http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/gemini-b.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes from Gemini===
*Systems designed for long term orbital storage (40 days)
*New cockpit layout and instruments&lt;ref&gt;http://www.space1.com/pdf/news1096.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Helium-oxygen cabin atmosphere
*Larger heat shield to handle higher energy reentries from polar orbit
*Spacecraft orientation was handled by the forward RCS thrusters only (no Gemini OAMS)
*Six solid propellant retrofire motors, used for deorbit or abort rockets in case of launch vehicle failure

==Development==
===Test Flight===
[[File:Titan-3C MOL-Gemini-B-Test 3.jpg|thumb|MOL test launch [[OPS 0855]], 3 November 1966, Cape Canaveral, FL]]
{{see also|OPS 0855}}
Test flight [[OPS 0855]] for MOL was launched on 3 November 1966 at 13:50:42&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on a [[Titan IIIC]]-9 from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Launch Complex 40]]. The flight consisted of a MOL [[mockup]] built from a [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] propellant tank, and the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|refurbished capsule]] from the [[Gemini 2]] mission as a [[prototype]] {{nowrap|Gemini B}} spacecraft.

After the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|Gemini B prototype]] separated for a sub-orbital [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]], the MOL mockup continued into [[orbit]] and released three satellites. A hatch installed in the Gemini's [[heat shield]]—intended to provide access to the MOL during manned operations—was tested during the capsule's reentry. The Gemini capsule was recovered near [[Ascension Island]] in the South Atlantic by the {{USS|La Salle|AGF-3|6}} after a flight of 33 minutes.

The [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|Gemini no.2 capsule]] used in the only flight of the MOL program is on display at the [[Air Force Space &amp; Missile Museum]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afspacemuseum.org/displays/GeminiCapsule/ |title=Gemini Capsule |publisher=Air Force Space &amp; Missile Museum |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A test article at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], [[Ohio]], is the Gemini B spacecraft (sometimes confused with [[Blue Gemini]]).  It is recognized by its distinctive "US Air Force" written on the side, and the circular hatch cut through the heat shield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=551 |title=Gemini Spacecraft |publisher=National Museum of the US Air Force |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302112233/http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=551 |archivedate=2 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KH-10===
{{main|KH-10 Dorian}}
[[File:Dorian 6.jpg|thumb|KH-10 mission module]]
Starting in 1965 a large optical system was added to the spacecraft for military reconnaissance.  This camera system was codenamed ''Dorian'' and given the designation [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]]. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.

The KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the unmanned [[KH-11 Kennan]], which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its [[Almaz|manned space reconnaissance program]].  The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} imaging [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.&lt;ref name=Astro/&gt;

===Cancellation===
The program was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary [[Melvin R. Laird]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] strongly supported the station, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[Richard Helms]] did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] agreed to the [[Bureau of the Budget]]'s proposal to cancel MOL,&lt;ref name="heppenheimer1998"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/contents.htm |title=The Space Shuttle Decision |publisher=NASA |first=T. A. |last=Heppenheimer |year=1998 |pages=204–205 |id=SP-4221 |oclc=40305626}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it was determined the capabilities of unmanned spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of manned MOL missions.

NASA offered those under 35 years of age the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 MOL astronauts were younger than 35 and took the offer, becoming [[NASA Astronaut Group 7]]: future [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard H. Truly]], [[Karol J. Bobko]], [[Robert Crippen]], [[C. Gordon Fullerton]], [[Henry W. Hartsfield]], [[Robert F. Overmyer]], and [[Donald H. Peterson]]. All flew on the [[Space Shuttle]].

===Declassification===
[[File:MOL-Space-Suit-02.jpg|thumb|MH-7 training suit]]
In 2005, two MH-7 training [[space suit]]s from the MOL program were discovered in a locked room in the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 5|Launch Complex 5/6]] museum on Cape Canaveral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/features/found_mol_spacesuits.html |title=Suits for Space Spies |work=NASA.gov |first=Ashley |last=Nutter |date=2 June 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015, the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] declassified over 800 files and photos related to the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/MOL.html |title=Index, Declassified Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) Records |publisher=National Reconnaissance Office |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
In the 2016 novel ''Blue Darker Than Black'' by Mike Jenne, the MOL program is secretly transferred from the Air Force to the United States Navy after its official cancellation in 1969. The Navy launches an ocean surveillance MOL in July 1972. Two Air Force [[Blue Gemini]] astronauts fly a rescue mission to the MOL after its crew is incapacitated by the [[August 1972#August 4, 1972 (Friday)|August 4, 1972]] solar storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenne|first=Mike|title=Blue Darker Than Black|publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing|Yucca Publishing]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1-63158-066-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[File:Galileo's geometrical and military compass in Putnam Gallery, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|Galileo's geometrical and military compass, thought to have been made c. 1604 by Mazzoleni]]Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni was the son of Paolo Mazzoleni, of the Mazzoleni family of Paduan clockmakers, and Marietta Bazi.&lt;ref name="IMSS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brunelleschi.imss.fi.it/itineraries/biography/MarcantonioMazzoleni.html |title=Marcantonio Mazzoleni |work=Scientific Itineraries in Tuscany |publisher=Institute and Museum of the History of Science |accessdate=13 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marc'Antonio's uncle Francesco operated a successful artisan workshop in Padua.&lt;ref name="IMSS"/&gt;  Marc'Antonio's older brother Mario was to hold the chair in Natural Philosophy at the [[University of Padua]], a position that he held for thirty-six years.&lt;ref name="IMSS"/&gt;

Mazzoleni had been working as an instrument maker at the [[Venetian Arsenal|Arsenale]] in [[Venice]] when, in 1597, Galileo hired him as his personal instrument maker.&lt;ref name="Harvard Dept HoS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dssmhi1.fas.harvard.edu/emuseumdev/code/emuseum.asp?style=text&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;page=search&amp;profile=people&amp;searchdesc=Marc%27Antonio%20Mazzoleni......&amp;searchstring=constituentid/,/is/,/1000/,/false/,/true&amp;sessionid=53C1A07F-9951-4EBC-8998-464687E710C3&amp;action=advsearch&amp;style=single&amp;currentrecord=1 |title=People: Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni |work=Waywiser online database of Harvard's Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments |publisher=Harvard University Department of the History of Science |accessdate=13 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1599, Mazzoleni, his wife, and his daughter moved into Galileo's home in [[Padua]], where Galileo was teaching at the University of Padua.&lt;ref name="IMSS"/&gt;  (Mazzoleni's wife became Galileo's cook and housekeeper.&lt;ref name="Harvard Dept HoS"/&gt;)

Both during the four years he lived in Galileo's household and thereafter, Mazzoleni constructed instruments for Galileo, notably the military compass that Galileo invented and sold (along with an instruction manual written by Galileo).&lt;ref name="IMSS"/&gt;  Mazzoleni would build more than 100 of these compasses for Galileo.&lt;ref name="Reston"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwXFV8RZoJQC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=marc+antonio+mazzoleni+-soccer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t9aVWKvJt2&amp;sig=taGJbGNCyghM_qWz33B0YwP49H8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g7p2S42wJ8XY8Aaf14D0CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=marc%20antonio%20mazzoleni%20-soccer&amp;f=false |title=Galileo a Life |first= |last= |author= Reston, James Jr. |year=2000 |publisher= Beard Books|location= |pages=55–56 |accessdate=13 Feb 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mazzoleni also helped Galileo produce other instruments, including hydrostatic balances, air thermometers, magnets and magnetic compasses for ships, and various kinds of [[Compass (drafting)|drawing compasses]] for engineers and architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iX0RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=%22galileo,+his+life+and+work%22+fahie&amp;ei=gWh5S_uyIZCENJbn5NYE&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Galileo: His Life and Work |author=Fahie, John Joseph |year=1903 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |at=p. 93, n. 1 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For his services, Galileo paid Mazzoleni a meager salary of six crowns per year (in addition to room and board).&lt;ref name="Reston"/&gt;

[[Image:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|Early model use from "[[A Trip to the Moon]]"]]
A '''miniature effect''' is a [[special effect]] created for motion pictures and television programs using [[scale model]]s. Scale models are often combined with [[high speed photography]] or [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte shots]] to make gravitational and other effects appear convincing to the viewer. The use of miniatures has largely been superseded by [[computer-generated imagery]] in the contemporary cinema.

Where a miniature appears in the foreground of a shot, this is often very close to the camera lens — for example when matte painted backgrounds are used. Since the exposure is set to the object being filmed so the actors appear well lit, the miniature must be over-lit in order to balance the exposure and eliminate any depth of field differences that would otherwise be visible. This foreground miniature usage is referred to as [[forced perspective]]. Another form of miniature effect uses [[stop motion]] [[animation]].

Use of scale models in the creation of visual effects by the entertainment industry dates back to the earliest days of cinema.  Models and miniatures are copies of people, animals, buildings, settings and objects. Miniatures or models are used to represent things that do not really exist, or that are too expensive or difficult to film in reality, such as explosions, floods or fires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscars.org/teachersguide/visualeffects/activity1.html Visual Effects | Activity 1 | Teacher's Resource Guide | YMI, Ltd./AMPAS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905085905/http://www.oscars.org/teachersguide/visualeffects/activity1.html |date=September 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== From 1900 to the mid-1960s ==
French director [[Georges Méliès]] incorporated special effects in his 1902 film ''[[A Trip to the Moon|Le Voyage dans la Lune]]'' (''A Trip to the Moon'') — including double-exposure, split screens, miniatures and stop-action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=A medium in motion|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/cl-ca-125filmtech21may21,0,6395197.story|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most influential visual effects films of these early years such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941), ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954) ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/10_cbd_4.htm|title=Motion Picture Directing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1933 film ''[[King Kong]]'' made extensive use of miniature effects including scale models and stop-motion animation of miniature elements.

== From the mid-1960s ==
[[Image:Discovery1b.JPG|thumb|right|2001's Discovery miniature]]The use of miniatures in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animated-news.com/2007/ves-unveils-“50-most-influential-visual-effects-films-of-all-time” VES Unveils “50 Most Influential Visual Effects Films of All Time”]&lt;/ref&gt; was a major development. In production for three years, the film was a significant advancement in creating convincing models.

In the early 1970s, miniatures were often used to depict disasters in such films as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972), ''[[Earthquake (1974 film)|Earthquake]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]'' (1975).

The resurgence of the science fiction genre in film in the late 1970s saw miniature fabrication rise to new heights in such films as  ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', (1977), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (also 1977), ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979), ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979) and ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982). Iconic film sequences such as the tanker truck explosion from ''[[The Terminator]]'' (1984) and the bridge destruction in ''[[True Lies]]'' (1994) were achieved through the use of large-scale miniatures.

== Largely replaced by CGI ==
The release of ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) was a turning point in the use of computers to create effects for which physical miniatures would have previously been employed.

=== Slurpasaur ===
"Slurpasaur" is a nickname given to optically enlarged [[reptile]]s (and occasionally other animals) that are presented as [[dinosaur]]s in motion pictures.

Concurrently with [[Willis O'Brien]] and others in making [[stop-motion]] animated dinosaurs since the early days of cinema, producers have used optically enlarged lizards, often with horns and fins glued on, to represent dinosaurs, to cut costs, and to present a living analog to dinosaurs, despite huge morphological differences between dinosaurs and reptiles. The first film that used reptiles dressed as dinosaurs was [[D.W. Griffith]]'s [[Brute Force (1914 film)|''Brute Force'']].  Various slurpasaurs appeared in the [[The Mysterious Island (1929 film)|1929 film version of ''The Mysterious Island'']], the 1933 British film ''Secret of the Loch'', and the 1936 ''Flash Gordon'' serial. The first major use of the slurpasaur was in ''[[One Million B.C.]]'' (1940), which included a pig dressed as a triceratops, with the [[special effects]] in this film re-used often, such as in the 1955 movie ''[[King Dinosaur]]''.

Other notable films with slurpasaurs include ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (1959) and ''[[The Lost World (1960 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1960). The former featured reptiles with attached tall spinal fans, simulating [[Dimetrodon]]s and looked superficially similar to those creatures, as Dimetrodons had a low slung body structure more reminiscent of lizards. The latter is notable for a dinosaur battle wherein a [[monitor lizard]] and a young [[American alligator|alligator]] engage in an unsimulated, fierce battle. On the 1960 ''Lost World'', O'Brien, who did the stop-motion dinosaurs for the original, was hired as the effects technician, but was disappointed that producer Irwin Allen opted for live animals.

The '''Morea expedition''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Expédition de Morée}}) is the name given in France to the land intervention of the [[French Army]] in the [[Peloponnese]] (at the time often still known by its medieval name, [[Morea]]) between 1828 and 1833, at the time of the [[Greek War of Independence]].
[[File:Prise de Coron par le général de brigade Sébastiani.jpg|thumb|300px|''Capture of Koroni by General Sebastiani'' ([[Hippolyte Lecomte]]).]]
After the [[Siege of Messolonghi (1825)|fall of Messolonghi]], Western Europe decided to intervene in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their attitude toward the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Egypt under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egypt]]ian ally, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation of the occupied regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a [[Bourbon Restoration|Franco]]-[[Russian Empire|Russo]]-[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] fleet was sent to the region, winning the [[Battle of Navarino]] in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at [[Koroni]] in the southern Peloponnese. The soldiers were stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, then taking control of the principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.

As during [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian Campaign]], when a [[Egyptian Institute of Sciences and Arts|Commission of Sciences and Arts]] had accompanied the military campaign, a ''Morea scientific expedition'' (''Expédition scientifique de Morée.'') accompanied the troops. Seventeen learned men representing different specialties (natural history and antiquities – archaeology, architecture and sculpture) made the voyage. Their work was of major importance in increasing knowledge about the country. As an example, the topographic maps they produced were excellent. More significantly, the measurements, drawings, profiles, plans and proposals for the theoretical restoration of Peloponnesian monuments, of [[Attica]] and of the [[Cyclades]] were, following [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]]'s ''[[Antiquities of Athens]]'', a new attempt to systematically and exhaustively catalogue ancient Greek ruins. The Morea expedition and its publications offered a near-complete description of the regions visited. They formed a scientific, aesthetic and human inventory that remained one of the best means, short of visiting them in person, to get to know the regions.

==Context==

===Military and diplomatic context===
{{main|Greek War of Independence}}
In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman rule]]. They won numerous victories early on and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted the principles of the [[Congress of Vienna]] and of the [[Holy Alliance]], which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.

The liberal and national uprising displeased the [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] of [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]], the principal political architect of the Holy Alliance. However, Russia, another reactionary gendarme of Europe, looked favorably on the insurrection due to its [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious solidarity and its geostrategic interest (control of the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosphorus]]). France, another active member of the Holy Alliance, had just intervened in Spain against liberals at [[Battle of Trocadero|Trocadero]] (1823) but held an ambiguous position: Paris saw the liberal Greeks first and foremost as Christians, and their uprising against the Muslim Ottomans had undertones of a new crusade. Great Britain, a liberal country, was interested in the regional situation primarily because it lay on the route to [[British East India Company|India]] and London wished to exercise a form of control there. For all of Europe, Greece represented the cradle of Western civilisation and of art since antiquity.

[[File:La Grèce sur les ruines des Missolonghi.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], ''Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi''. This painting played an important role in the public opinion campaign in the West that led to an intervention.]]

The Greek victories had been short-lived. The Sultan had called to his aid his Egyptian vassal [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who had dispatched his son [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] to Greece with a fleet and 8,000 men, later adding a further 25,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;''An Index of events in the military history of the Greek nation.'', Hellenic Army General Staff, Army History Directorate, Athens, 1998, pp. 51 and 54. {{ISBN|960-7897-27-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim's intervention proved decisive: much of the Peloponnese had been reconquered in 1825; the gateway town of [[Siege of Messolonghi (1825)|Messolonghi]] had fallen in 1826; Athens had been taken in 1827. All that Greek nationalists still held was [[Nafplion]], [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]], [[Mani Peninsula|Mani]] and [[Aegina]].

A strong current of [[philhellenism]] developed in Western Europe. Thus it was decided to intervene in favour of Greece, the cradle of civilisation and a Christian vanguard in the Orient whose strategic location was clear. By the [[Treaty of London (1827)|Treaty of London]] of July 1827,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96067j/f505.table The text on Gallica]&lt;/ref&gt;
France, Russia and the United Kingdom recognised the autonomy of Greece, which remained a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] to accept the terms of the convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a show of force was proposed and adopted. A joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exercise diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The [[Battle of Navarino]] (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.

In 1828, Ibrahim Pasha thus found himself in a difficult situation: he had just suffered a defeat at Navarino; the joint fleet exercised a blockade which prevented him from receiving reinforcements and supplies; his Albanian troops, whom he could no longer pay, had returned to their country under the protection of Theodoros Kolokotronis’ Greek troops. On August 6, 1828, a convention had been signed at [[Alexandria]] between the viceroy of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, and the British admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. Ibrahim Pasha had to evacuate his Egyptian troops and leave the Peloponnese to the few Turkish troops (estimated at 1200 men) remaining there. However, Ibrahim Pasha refused to honor the agreement that had been reached, continuing to control various Greek regions: [[Messenia]], [[Pylos|Navarino]], [[Patras]] and several other strongholds. He had also ordered the systematic destruction of [[Tripoli, Greece|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Brunet de Presle and Alexandre Blanchet, ''La Grèce'', p. 555.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the French government of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] was beginning to have doubts about its Greek policy.&lt;ref&gt;de Presle, p. 556.
&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Pasha himself noted this ambiguity when he met [[Nicolas Joseph Maison|General Maison]] in September: “Why was France, after enslaving men in Spain in 1823, now coming to Greece to make men free?”&lt;ref&gt;Arch de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually a liberal agitation, pro-Greek and inspired by what was then happening in that country, began to develop in France. The longer France waited, the more delicate her position vis-à-vis [[Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Metternich]] became. The ultra-royalist government thus decided to accelerate events. A land expedition was proposed to Great Britain, which refused to intervene directly. Meanwhile, Russia had declared [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|war]] against the Ottoman Empire and its military victories were unsettling for London, which did not wish to see the Tsarist empire extend too far south. Thus Great Britain did not oppose an intervention by France alone.&lt;ref&gt;Arch. de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', vol. 7, p. 649.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual context===
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophy had developed Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised [[Ancient Greece]], the linchpin of [[ancient history|Antiquity]], as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all [[Athenian democracy|Athens]], became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works such as those of Abbé [[Jean-Jacques Barthélemy|Barthélemy]], ''[[Anacharsis|Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis]]'' (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].

The theories and system of interpreting ancient art devised by [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] influenced European tastes for decades. His major work, ''History of Ancient Art'', was published in 1764 and translated into French in 1766 (the English translation came later, in 1881). In this major work Winckelmann initiated the tradition of dividing ancient art into periods, classifying the works chronologically and stylistically.&lt;ref&gt;Alain Schnapp, ''La Conquête du passé. Aux origines de l'archéologie.'', Editions Carré, Paris, 1993. p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

The views of Winckelmann on art encompassed the entirety of civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development and the evolution of its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation, in terms of progress, apogee and then decline.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, ''Taste and the Antique.'', Yale University Press, 1981, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; For him, Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement, culminating with [[Phidias]]. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful ([[Praxiteles]]) and Decadent (Roman period).
[[File:Burrow Parthenon.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The [[Parthenon]], at the time of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]].]]
Winckelmann's theories on the evolution of art culminated in the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of complete political and religious liberty. The theories idealised Ancient Greece and increased people's desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in Ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Roland and Françoise Etienne, ''La Grèce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 60-61.&lt;/ref&gt; Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.&lt;ref&gt;Roland and Françoise Etienne, ''La Grèce antique.'', Gallimard, 1990, p. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French government had planned the Morea expedition in the same spirit as those of [[James Stuart (1713-1788)|James Stuart]] and [[Nicholas Revett]], whose work it wished to complete. The semi-scientific expeditions commissioned and financed by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] remained a benchmark: these represented the first attempts to rediscover Ancient Greece. The first, that of Stuart and Revett to Athens and the islands, took place in 1751–1753, and resulted in ''The Antiquities of Athens'', mined by architects and designers for a refined "Grecian" [[neoclassicism]]. The expedition of Revett, [[Richard Chandler]] and William Pars to Asia Minor took place between 1764 and 1766. Finally, the “[[Elgin Marbles|work]]” of [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] on the [[Parthenon]] at the beginning of the 19th century had sparked further longing for Greece: it now seemed possible to build vast collections of ancient art in Western Europe.

==Military expedition==

===Preparation===
The Chamber of Deputies authorised a loan of 80 million gold [[French franc|francs]] to allow the government to meet its obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Calmon, ''Histoire parlementaire des finances de la Restauration.'', Michel Lévy, 1868–1870, vol. 2, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; An expeditionary corps of 13,000–15,000 men&lt;ref&gt;Sources differ on this point. Brunet de Presle and A. Blanchet, ''La Grèce'' give 13,000 men; A. Hugo, ''France militaire'' has 14,000; Arch. de Vaulabelle, ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'', 14,062. The ''Revue des Deux Mondes'' (vol. 141, 1897) gives 480 officers and 8,489 regular troops plus 17 officers and 391 soldiers in the military engineers. General histories estimate 15,000.&lt;/ref&gt; commanded by Lieutenant-General [[Nicolas Joseph Maison]] was formed. It was composed of three brigades commanded by the ''[[Maréchal de camp|maréchaux de camp]]'' [[Tiburce Sébastiani]] (brother of the Corsican soldier-diplomat [[Horace François Bastien Sébastiani de La Porta]]), [[Philippe Higonet]], and [[Virgile Schneider]]. The Chief of the General Staff was General [[Antoine Simon Durrieu]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Hugo, ''France militaire. Histoire des armées françaises.'', vol. 5, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The expeditionary corps was made up of nine infantry regiments:&lt;ref&gt;Sources differ. A. Hugo in ''France militaire'' suggests the 54th and the 58th Infantry Regiments, whereas Arch. de Vaulabelle in ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'' names the 56th and 58th Infantry Regiments and [http://perso.orange.fr/bernard.labarbe/Histo57RI.pdf ''L’Historique du 57&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; Régiment d’Infanterie''] says that this regiment left for the Morea (in fact, it formed part of the replacements that arrived in 1830). The composition of the brigades is that given by A. Hugon, as it is the most precise.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1st brigade: [[8th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|8th Line Infantry Regiment]], [[16th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|16th Line Infantry Regiment]], [[27th Light Infantry Regiment (France)|27th Light Infantry Regiment]]
*2nd brigade: [[35th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|35th Line Infantry Regiment]], [[46th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|46th Line Infantry Regiment]], [[58th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|58th Line Infantry Regiment]]
*3rd brigade: [[29th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|29th Line Infantry Regiment]], [[42nd Line Infantry Regiment (France)|42nd Line Infantry Regiment]], [[54th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|54th Line Infantry Regiment]]
Also departing were the [[3rd Chasseur Regiment]] (commanded by Colonel [[Paul-Eugène de Faudoas-Barbazan]]), four companies of artillery (with equipment for campaigns, sieges, and mountains) of the 3rd and 8th Artillery Regiments, and two companies of military engineers (sappers and miners).&lt;ref&gt;A. Hugo, ''France militaire.'' gives the 3rd Military Engineers Regiment while Vaulabelle’s ''Histoire des deux Restaurations'' gives the 2nd Military Engineers Regiment.&lt;/ref&gt;

A transport fleet protected by warships was organised; sixty ships sailed in all. Equipment, victuals, munitions and 1,300 horses had to be brought over, as well as arms, munitions and money for the Greek provisional government of [[John Capodistria]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Hugo, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; France wished to support free Greece as it came into being by helping it activate its army, with the aim of gaining influence in the region.

The first brigade left [[Toulon]] on August 17; the second, two days later; and the third on September 1. The general in command, Nicolas Joseph Maison, was with the first brigade, aboard the [[ship of the line]] ''[[French ship Ville de Marseille (1812)|Ville de Marseille]]''. The first convoy was composed of merchant ships and apart from the ''Ville de Marseille'', it included the frigates ''[[French ship Agamemnon (1812)|Amphitrite]]'', ''[[French frigate Pauline (1807)|Bellone]]'' and ''[[French frigate Cybèle|Cybèle]]''. The second convoy was escorted by ship of the line ''[[French ship Duquesne (1813)|Duquesne]]'' and the frigates ''[[French frigate Iphigénie (1827)|Iphigénie]]'' and ''[[French frigate Armide|Armide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Vice-Admiral Jurien de la Gravière, « Station du Levant. L’Expédition de Morée », in ''Revue des deux Mondes'', 1874, p. 867.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operations in the Peloponnese===

====Landing====
[[File:Navarino and the island of Sphagia.png|thumb|left|250px|The bay and [[old Navarino castle]]]]

On August 29, the fleet transporting the two first brigades arrived in Navarino bay, where the joint Franco-Russo-British squadron was berthed. The Egyptian army was concentrated between Navarino and [[Methoni, Messenia|Methoni]]. Thus, the landing was risky. The fleet sailed toward the Gulf of [[Koroni]] protected by a fortress held by the Ottomans. The expeditionary corps began to disembark without meeting any opposition on the evening of August 29, finishing on the morning of August 30. A proclamation by governor Capodistria had informed the Greek population of the imminent arrival of a French expedition. The locals rushed up before the troops as soon as they set foot on Greek soil and offered them food.&lt;ref&gt;Arch. de Vaulabelle, p.471.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French pitched camp in the plain of Koroni, near Petalidi, on the site of the ancient [[Coronea]]. The third brigade, which had borne up against a storm and lost three ships, managed to land at Koroni on September 16.&lt;ref name = "Hugo317"&gt;A. Hugo, ''France militaire'', vol. 5, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt;

====Departure of the Egyptian Army====
[[File:IbrahimBaja.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ibrahim Pasha]]

Ibrahim Pasha used a number of pretexts to delay the evacuation: problems with food supply or transport, or unforeseen difficulties in the strongholds’ handover. The French officers had difficulties in maintaining the fighting zeal of their soldiers, who for example had become excited at the (false) news that an imminent march on Athens would take place.&lt;ref&gt;Abel Blouet, ''Expédition scientifique de Morée.'', p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; This impatience on the part of the French troops was perhaps decisive in convincing the Egyptian commander to respect his obligations. Moreover, French soldiers were beginning to suffer from autumn rains which drenched their tent camp, increasing the likelihood of fever and especially of [[dysentery]]. On September 24, [[Louis-Eugène Cavaignac]] wrote that thirty men of 400 in his company of military engineers were affected by fever.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to his mother in ''Revue des deux Mondes.'', vol. 141, 1897, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; General Maison wished to be able to set up his men in the fortresses’ barracks.&lt;ref&gt;Arch. de Vaulabelle, p. 471.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 7, Ibrahim Pasha accepted to evacuate his troops as of September 9. The agreement reached with General Maison provided that the Egyptians would leave with their arms, baggage and horses, but without any Greek slave or prisoner. As the Egyptian fleet could not evacuate the entire army in one go, supplies were authorised for the troops who remained on land; these men had just undergone a lengthy blockade.&lt;ref name = "Hugo317" /&gt; A first Egyptian division, 5,500 men and 27 ships, set sail on September 16, escorted by three ships from the joint fleet (two English ones and the French frigate ''[[French frigate Sirène|Sirène]]'').

The last Egyptian transport sailed away on October 5, taking Ibrahim Pasha. Of the 40,000 men he had brought from Egypt, he was taking back barely 20,000.&lt;ref name="Alexandre Blanchet p. 556"&gt;M. Brunet de Presle and Alexandre Blanchet, p. 556.&lt;/ref&gt; A few Ottoman soldiers remained in order to hold the different strongholds of the Peloponnese. The next mission of the French troops was to “give security” to these and hand them back to independent Greece.

====Strongholds taken====
[[File:Blouet Citadelle Navarin.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The fortress of Navarino]]

On October 6, General Maison ordered General Higonet to march on Navarino. He left with the 16th Infantry Regiment, which included artillery and military engineers. Thus, Navarino's seacoast was put under siege by Admiral [[Henri de Rigny]]’s fleet and the land siege was undertaken by General Higonet's soldiers. The Turkish commander of the fort refused to surrender:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] is at war with neither the French nor the English; we will commit no hostile act, but we will not surrender the fort.”&lt;ref name = "Hugo317" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hence, the sappers received an order to open a breach in the walls. General Higonet entered the fortress, held by 250 men who surrendered with sixty cannons and 800,000 rounds of ammunition.&lt;ref name = "Hugo317" /&gt; The French troops moved in intending to remain for some time, building up Navarino's fortifications, rebuilding its houses and setting up a hospital and various features of local administration.

[[File:Methoni Castle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The fortress of Methoni]]

On October 7, the 35th Line Infantry Regiment, commanded by General Durrieu, accompanied by artillery and by military engineers, appeared before Methoni, defended by 1,078 men and a hundred cannons, and which had food supplies for six months.&lt;ref name = "Hugo317" /&gt; Two ships of the line, the ''[[French ship Breslaw|Breslaw]]'' (Captain Maillard) and {{HMS|Wellesley|1815|6}} (Captain [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|Frederick Lewis Maitland]]) blocked the port and threatened the fortress with their cannons. The fort's commanders, the Turk Hassan Pasha and the Egyptian Ahmed Bey, made the same reply as had the commander of Navarino. Methoni's fortifications were in a better state than those of Navarino. Thus the sappers focused on opening the city gate. The city's garrison did not defend it. The commanders of the fort explained that they could not surrender it without disobeying the Sultan's orders, but also recognised that it was impossible for them to resist. Thus the fort had to be taken, at least symbolically, by force.&lt;ref name = "Hugo317" /&gt;

[[File:Blouet Forteresse Coron.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The fortress of Koroni]]

It was more difficult to take Koroni. General Sébastiani showed up there on October 7 with a party from his brigade. The fort commander's response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Cavaignac to his mother, October 12, 1828, in ''Revue des deux Mondes.'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The ''Amphitrite'', the ''Breslaw'' and the ''Wellesley'' came to the assistance of the ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.&lt;ref name = "Hugo317" /&gt;

[[Patras]] had been controlled by Ibrahim Pasha since the evacuation of the Peloponnese. The third brigade had been sent by sea to take the city, located in the north-western part of the peninsula. It landed on October 4. General Schneider gave Hadji Abdullah, Pasha of Patras and of the “[[Rio Castle|Castle of the Morea]]”, twenty-four hours to hand over the fort. On October 5, when the ultimatum expired, three columns marched on the city and the artillery was deployed. The Pasha immediately signed the capitulation of Patras and of the “Castle of the Morea”.&lt;ref name = "Hugo317" /&gt; However, the [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]s who commanded the latter refused to obey their pasha, whom they considered a traitor, and announced that they would rather die in the ruins of their fortress than surrender.

[[File:Patras-Schneider.png|thumb|''Surrender of [[Patras]] to [[Antoine Virgile Schneider]]'' (Hippolyte Lecomte).]]

====Siege of the "Morea Castle"====
The "Castle of the Morea" guarded the entry to the [[Gulf of Corinth]], near [[Rio, Greece|Rion]]. [[Bayezid II]] had built it in 1499.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Barber, ''Blue Guide. Greece.'', Black, London, 1987, p.392. {{ISBN|0-393-30372-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Schneider negotiated with the aghas, who persisted in their refusal to surrender. A siege was begun from in front of the fortress and fourteen marine and field guns, placed a little over 400 meters away, reduced the artillery of those under siege to silence.&lt;ref name = "Hugo319"&gt;A. Hugo, ''France militaire'', vol. 5, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; Admiral de Rigny had General Maison put all his artillery and sappers on board. By land Maison sent two infantry regiments and the 3rd Light Cavalry Regiment. Reinforcements arrived on October 23. New batteries nicknamed “for breaching” (''de brèche'') were installed. These received the names of [[Charles X of France|Charles X]], [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], the [[Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoulême|Duke of Angoulême]], the [[Henri, comte de Chambord|Duke of Bordeaux]] and “Marine”.&lt;ref name = "Hugo319" /&gt; A party from the British fleet and {{HMS|Blonde|1819|6}} under Captain [[Edmund Lyons, 1st Baron Lyons|Edmund Lyons]] came to add their cannons.

On October 30, the batteries opened fire. In four hours, a breach was largely opened in the ramparts. Then, an emissary came out with a white flag to negotiate the terms of the fort's surrender. General Maison replied that the terms had been negotiated at the beginning of the month at Patras. He added that he did not trust a group of besieged men who had not respected a first agreement to respect a second one. He gave the garrison half an hour to evacuate the fort, without arms or baggage.&lt;ref name = "Hugo319" /&gt; The aghas submitted. However, the fortress’ resistance had cost 25 men, killed or wounded in the French expedition.&lt;ref&gt;M. Brunet de Presle and Alexandre Blanchet, p. 556.; A. Hugo, p. 319; and Arch de Vaulabelle, p. 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

===French in the Peloponnese===
On November 5, 1828, the last “non-Greeks” (Turks, Egyptians or Muslims generally) left the Morea. 2,500 Turks and their families were placed aboard French vessels headed for [[İzmir|Smyrna]].&lt;ref name = "Hugo319" /&gt;

The French and British ambassadors [[Conference of Poros|had set themselves up]] at [[Poros]] and invited Constantinople to send a diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into [[Attica]] and [[Euboea]]. The British opposed this plan. Thus it was left to the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.&lt;ref name="Alexandre Blanchet p. 556"/&gt;

Gradually, the Morea was evacuated of troops. The Schneider brigade, of which Cavaignac was a member, boarded ship in the first days of April 1829. General Maison left on May 22, 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Eugène Cavaignac to his mother, March 30, 1829, in ''Revue des deux Mondes.'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Only one brigade remained in the Peloponnese. Fresh troops came from France to relieve the soldiers present in Greece: thus the [[57th Line Infantry Regiment (France)|57th Line Infantry Regiment]] landed at Navarino on July 25, 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Capitaine Berthemet, ''Historique du 57&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; régiment d'infanterie.'', Bordeaux, 1901, chapter 9. The regiment remained until 1833.&lt;/ref&gt; France did not withdraw its troops for good until after [[Otto of Greece|King Otto]] arrived in Greece in January 1833, accompanied by the [[Bavarian Auxiliary Corps]].

The French troops, commanded by General [[Charles Louis Joseph Olivier Guéhéneuc]], did not remain idle during these nearly five years. Fortifications were raised, like those at Navarino.&lt;ref&gt;"The city of Navarino (...) was handed over in 1829 to the French, whose army occupies it today. Part of the garrison is working to re-establish the citadel and the fortifications that surround it", in Abel Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux-Arts.'', vol. 1, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Bridges were constructed, such as those over the [[Pamissos River]] between [[Kalamata]] and Methoni. The Methoni–Navarino road was built, and improvements were made to Peloponnesian towns (barracks, bridges, gardens, etc.).&lt;ref name = "Hugo319" /&gt;

===Military results of the expedition===
The Ottoman Empire could no longer depend on Egyptian troops to hold Greece. The strategic situation now resembled that existing before 1825 and the landing of Ibrahim Pasha. Then, the Greek insurgents had triumphed on all fronts.

After the Morea military expedition, the Greeks only had to face the Turkish troops in [[Central Greece]]. [[Livadeia]], gateway to Boeotia, was conquered at the beginning of November 1828. A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from Euboea was repulsed in January 1829. In April, [[Naupaktos]] was restored to the Greeks; in May, [[Augustinos Kapodistrias]] recaptured the symbolic town of Messolonghi.&lt;ref&gt;''An Index of Events in the military History of the Greek Nation'', p. 65-67.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it took the military victory of Russia in the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29]] and the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] before the independence of Greece was recognised.

The Greek territories that had been liberated by September 1829, a year after the Morea military expedition—the Peloponnese and central Greece—were those which would form independent Greece after 1832.

==Scientific expedition==
[[File:Blouet Morée.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Frontispice of ''Expédition scientifique de Morée'' by Abel Blouet.]]

The Morea expedition was the second of the great military-scientific expeditions led by France in the first half of the 19th century. The first, used as a benchmark, had been [[Expedition of Egypt|the Egyptian one]], starting in 1798; the last took place in [[Algeria]] from 1839. All three took place at the initiative of the French government and were placed under the guidance of a particular ministry (Foreign relations for Egypt, Interior for the Morea and War for Algeria).&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lepetit, “Missions scientifiques et expéditions militaires : remarques sur leurs modalités d’articulation.”, in ''L’Invention scientifique de la Méditerranée.'', p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The great scientific institutions recruited learned men (both civilians and from the military) and specified their missions, but ''in situ'' work took place in close co-operation with the army.

The Commission of Sciences and Arts from [[Napoleon]]’s Egyptian expedition, and especially the publications that followed, had become a model. As Greece was the other important “ancient” region considered as lying at the origin of [[Western civilisation]] (one of the [[philhellenes]]’ principal arguments), it was decided to “take advantage of the presence of our soldiers who were occupying the Morea to send a learned commission. It did not have to equal that attached to the glory of Napoleon […] It did however need to render eminent services to the arts and sciences.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée.'', p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egypt and Algeria, scientific work took place under the army's protection. In the Morea, most troops were departing when exploration had barely begun. The army was content to provide logistical support: “tents, stakes, tools, liquid containers, large pots and sacks; in a word, everything that could be found for us to use in the army’s storehouses.”&lt;ref&gt;Bory de Saint-Vincent, ''Relation du voyage de la Commission scientifique de Morée.'', vol 1, p. 114, in Bernard Lepetit, cited article, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of the scientific expedition landed at Navarino on March 3, 1829, after 21 days at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Abel Blouet, ''Expédition scientifique de Morée.'', vol. 1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical sciences section===
This section included several sciences: [[botany]] ([[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]], Louis Despreaux Saint-Sauveur and Antoine Vincent Pector), [[geography]], geology (Pierre Théodore Virlet d’Aoust and Émile Puillon Boblaye) and [[zoology]]. The government insisted that a landscape artist also be sent, as [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] [[Jean Baptiste Gay, vicomte de Martignac|Martignac]] had asked for one so as not to restrict the observations “to flies and herbs, but to extend them to places and people.”&lt;ref&gt;Serge Briffaud, “L’Expédition scientifique de Morée et le paysage méditerranéen.” in ''L’invention scientifique de la Méditerranée'', p.293.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Geography====
One of the first objectives fixed by the French government had been to draw precise maps of the Peloponnese, with a scientific purpose, but also for economic and military reasons. The Minister of War, the Vicomte de Caux, had written to General Maison on January 6, 1829:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“All the maps of Greece are very imperfect and were drawn up based on more or less inaccurate templates; it is thus essential to fix them. Not only will geography be enriched by this research, but we will in the process support France’s commercial interests by making her relations easier, and it will above all be useful for our ground and naval forces, who may find themselves involved in this part of Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;Bory de Saint-Vincent, ''Expédition scientifique de Morée. Section des sciences physiques.'', vol. II ''Géographie et géologie.'', p. 18. in Bernard Lepetit, cited article, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In two years, a very precise map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, a base of 3,500 meters had been traced in the [[Argolis]], from one angle at the ruins of [[Tiryns]] to an angle of a house in ruins in the village of Aria.&lt;ref&gt;”Notice sur les opérations géodésiques exécutées en Morée, en 1829 et 1830, par MM. [[Pierre Peytier|Peytier]], Puillon-Boblaye et Servier” in ''Bulletin de la Société de géographie'', vol. 19, nr. 117-122, January – June 1833, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This was intended to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers.&lt;ref&gt;”Notice…”, Peytier ''et al.'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 [[Minute of arc|seconds]].&lt;ref&gt;”Notice…”, Peytier ''et al.'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula's mountains, as well as on [[Aegina]], [[Hydra, Saronic Islands|Hydra]] and [[Nafplion]]. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20&amp;nbsp;km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.&lt;ref&gt;”Notice…”, Peytier ''et al.'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The geographers suffered from fever—Bory de Saint-Vincent's team as much as that of Puillon-Boblaye:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“The horrible heat that beset us in July placed, for the rest, the entire topographic brigade in disarray. These gentlemen, having worked in the sun, have nearly all taken ill and eight days ago, we grieved to see M. Dechièvre die at [[Nafplion|Napoli]] eight days ago.”&lt;ref&gt;Bory de Saint-Vincent, Letter of August 4, 1829, in ''Bulletin de la Société de Géographie.'', vol. 12, nr. 75-80, July – December 1829., p. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt; (Bory de Saint-Vincent)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Of twelve officers employed in the geodesic service, two are dead and all have been sick. Besides them, we have lost two sappers and a household servant.”&lt;ref&gt;Puillon-Boblaye, Letter of August 23, 1829, in ''Bulletin de la Société de Géographie.'', vol. 12, nr. 75-80, July – December 1829., p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; (Puillon-Boblaye)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!--NEEDS INLINE CITATION Later, Capodistria charged Virlet d’Aoust with studying the possibility of cutting a [[Corinth Canal|canal]] across the [[Isthmus of Corinth]]. NEEDS INLINE CITATION--&gt;

====Botany and zoology====
[[Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent]] led the scientific expedition. Additionally, he made detailed botanical studies. He gathered a multitude of specimens: ''Flore de Morée'' (1832) lists 1,550 plants, of which 33 were [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and 91 were [[Poaceae|grasses]] (just 42 species had not yet been described); ''Nouvelle Flore du Péloponnèse et des Cyclades'' (1838) described 1,821 species.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Drouin, “Bory de Saint-Vincent et la géographie botanique.” in ''L’invention scientifique de la Méditerranée'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In Morea, Bory de Saint-Vincent was content to collect plants. He proceeded to classify, identify and describe them upon his return to France. Then he was aided, not by his collaborators from Greece, but by [[Louis Athanase Chaubard]], Jean-Baptiste Fauché and [[Adolphe-Théodore Brongniart]].&lt;ref&gt;Drouin, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the naturalists [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Étienne]] and [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] helped edit the expedition's scientific works.

As the gathering process went along, they sent the plants, as well as birds and fish, to France.&lt;ref&gt;''Nouvelles annales des voyages, de la géographie et de l’histoire ou Recueil des relations originales inédites'', July – August – September 1829, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morea expedition confirmed that the [[golden jackal]] existed in Greece. Although earlier travel narratives had mentioned its presence, these were not considered trustworthy. Moreover, the subspecies seen and described by the French (named ''[[Canis aureus moreotica]]'') was endemic to the region. Bory de Saint-Vincent brought back pelts and a skull.&lt;ref&gt;''Nouvelles annales des voyages, de la géographie et de l’histoire ou Recueil des relations originales inédites'', January – February – March 1837, p. 354-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine arts section===
[[File:Blouet Olympie 1831.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Olympia in 1829 as seen by the Morea expedition]]
This section was formed by the [[Institut de France]], which designated the architect [[Guillaume-Abel Blouet]] as its head. The Institut sent Amable Ravoisié, Pierre Achille Poirot, Frédéric de Gournay and Pierre Félix Trezel as his assistants.

The architect [[Jean-Nicolas Huyot]] gave very precise instructions to this section. Of wide-ranging experience formed in [[Asia Minor]] and Egypt and under the influence of engineers, he asked them to keep an authentic diary of their excavations where precision measurements read off watches and compasses should be written down, to draw a map of the region they travelled, and to describe the layout of the terrain.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lepetit, cited article, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Itineraries====
The publication of works on archaeology and art followed the same pattern as with works on physical and natural sciences: that of an itinerary with descriptions of the roads travelled, noteworthy monuments along these routes and descriptions of their destinations. Hence, volume I of ''Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts'' describes Navarino (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–7&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung16/werk/blouet1831.xml?docname=blouet1831&amp;pageid=PAGE0031 ''Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts.'', vol. 1, Navarino, pages 1 to 7]&lt;/ref&gt;) with six pages of plates (fountains, churches, the fortress of Navarino and the palace of [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]] at [[Pylos]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung16/werk/blouet1831.xml?docname=blouet1831&amp;pageid=PAGE0040 ''Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts.'', vol. 1, six pages of plates on Navarino]&lt;/ref&gt;); then on pages 9–10, the Navarino-Methoni road&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung16/werk/blouet1831.xml?docname=blouet1831&amp;pageid=PAGE0046 ''Expédition de Morée. Section des Beaux Arts.'', vol. 1, Navarin-Methoni road, pages 9 and 10]&lt;/ref&gt; is detailed with four pages of plates (a church in ruins and its frescoes, but also bucolic landscapes reminding the reader that the scene is not so far from [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]]);&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung16/werk/blouet1831.xml?docname=blouet1831&amp;pageid=PAGE0048 ''Expédition de Morée.

Section des Beaux Arts.'', vol. 1, four pages of plates. Methoni]&lt;/ref&gt; The bucolic landscapes were rather close to the “norm” that [[Hubert Robert]] had proposed for depictions of Greece.
[[File:Blouet Messène.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Gate of Messene in the “shepherd of Arcadia” style and influenced by Hubert Robert.]]
The presence of troops from the expeditionary corps was important, alternating with that of Greek shepherds:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“(…) their generous hospitality and simple and innocent mores reminded us of the beautiful period of pastoral life which fiction calls the [[Golden age]], and seemed to present to us as real people the characters of [[Theocritus]]’ and [[Virgil]]’s eclogues.”&lt;ref&gt;Abel Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée.'', tome 1, p. 25 à propos de Messène.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The archaeological expedition travelled through Navarino (Pylos), Methoni, Koroni, [[Messene]] and [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] (described in the publication's first volume); [[Bassae]], [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]], [[Sparta]], [[Mantineia]], [[Argos]], [[Mycenae]], Tiryns and Nafplion (subjects of the second volume); the [[Cyclades]] ([[Syros]], [[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Mykonos]], [[Delos]], [[Naxos Island|Naxos]] and [[Milos]]), [[Sounion]], Aegina, [[Epidaurus]], [[Troezen]], [[Nemea]], [[Corinth]], [[Sicyon]], [[Patras]], [[Elis]], Kalamata, the [[Mani Peninsula]], [[Cape Matapan]], [[Monemvasia]], Athens, [[Salamis Island]] and [[Eleusina]] (covered in volume III).

[[Edgar Quinet]] had left with the rest of the expedition. However, from the time he arrived in Greece, he kept apart from his companions, as did another member of his section, the [[Lyon]] sculptor Jean-Baptiste Vietty. The two travelled through the Peloponnese separately and Quinet visited [[Piraeus]] on April 21, 1829, thence reaching Athens. He saw the Cyclades in May, starting with Syros. Having taken ill, he returned to France on June 5, and his ''Grèce moderne et ses rapports avec l’Antiquité'' appeared in September 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Duchêne, ''Le Voyage en Grèce.'', Bouquins, Robert Laffont, 2003, {{ISBN|2-221-08460-8}}, p. 557.&lt;/ref&gt; Vietty pursued his research in Greece until August 1831, long after the expedition had returned to France at the end of 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Gioanni, « Jean-Baptiste Vietty et l'Expédition de Morée (1829). A propos de deux manuscrits retrouvés », in ''Journal des Savants'', 2008. 2, p. 383-429.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ways of exploration====
The artistic and archaeological exploration of the Peloponnese unfolded in the manner in which archaeological research was then conducted in Greece. The first step always involved an attempt to make an on-site check (a form of autopsy in the manner of [[Herodotus]]) against the texts of ancient authors like [[Homer]], [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] or [[Strabo]]. Thus, at Navarino, the location of Nestor's palace was determined from Homer and the adjectives “inaccessible” and “sandy”.&lt;ref&gt;Abel Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée.'' v. I, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; At Methoni, “the ancient remains of the port of which the description matches perfectly with that of Pausanias are enough to determine with certainty the location of the ancient town.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée.'', v. I, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having explored Navarino, Methoni and Koroni, the members of the expedition returned to Messene, where they spent a month starting on April 10.&lt;ref&gt;"During the month that we spent at Messene, I ordered some rather considerable excavations, the results of which were not without importance for our work". A Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée.'', v. I, p. 12. The following pages describe the stadium and the ancient monuments in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Olympia====
[[File:Stymphalos metope Olympia Louvre MA717AC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One of the [[Metope (architecture)|metope]]s of Olympia brought back to the [[Louvre]] by the Morea expedition]]

The expedition spent six weeks, starting on May 10, 1829,&lt;ref&gt;''Nouvelles annales des voyages, de la géographie et de l’histoire ou Recueil des relations originales inédites'', 1829, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Abel Blouet and Dubois undertook the first excavations there. They were accompanied by the painters Poirot, Trezel and Duval. The archaeological advice of Huyot was followed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Following the instructions which had been given to him by the commission of the Institute, this antiquarian (Dubois) had begun the excavations of which the result had been the discovery of the first bases of the two columns of the [[Portico|pronaos]] and several fragments of sculpture.”&lt;ref&gt;Abel Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée.'', vol. 1, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The site was divided into squares and excavations were undertaken in straight lines: archaeology was becoming rationalised, and it was in this way that the location of the temple of [[Zeus]] was determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung16/werk/blouet1831.xml?docname=blouet1831&amp;pageid=PAGE0164 Map of the location of the temple of Zeus at Olympia]&lt;/ref&gt; The simple chase after treasure was beginning to be abandoned.

The fundamental contribution of the Morea scientific expedition was in effect its attitude towards pillage and treasure hunting. Blouet refused to perform excavations that risked damaging the monuments, and banned the mutilation of statues with the intent of taking a piece separated from the rest of the statue without regard.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Polychronopoulou, ''Archéologues sur les pas d’Homère.'', p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; It is perhaps for this reason that the three [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] of the temple of Zeus discovered at Olympia were brought back in their entirety. In any case, this willingness to protect the integrity of monuments undoubtedly represented an [[epistemological]] progress.

====Byzantine Greece====
[[File:Blouet église Osphido.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The church at Osphino]]
The French did not limit their interest to Antiquity; they also described and drew [[Byzantine]] monuments. Quite often, and until then for the travellers as well, only Ancient Greece mattered; medieval and modern Greece were ignored. Blouet, in his ''Expédition de Morée'', gave very precise descriptions of the churches he saw. For instance, plate 9 (I, II and III) of volume I deals with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Layout, section and perspective view of one of the two small churches of the village of Osphino, situated on the slope of the mountain to the left of the Navarino-Methoni road; (…); its interior, decorated with paintings and frescoes, is divided into two parts by a [[Iconostasis|wall]] that forms a small closed sanctuary in the back in which the priest stands to officiate.”&lt;ref&gt;Abel Blouet, ''Expédition de Morée.'', tome 1, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Foundation of the French School at Athens ====
The results obtained by the Morea scientific expedition underscored the need to create a permanent, stable structure that would allow its work to continue. From 1846, it was possible to “systematically and permanently continue the work so gloriously and so happily begun by the Morea scientific expedition”&lt;ref&gt;M. Cavvadias, General Ephor of Antiquities, “Discours pour le cinquantenaire de l'Ecole Française d'Athènes”, ''Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique.'', XXII, 1899, p. LVIII.&lt;/ref&gt; due to the creation on rue Didot, at the foot of [[Mount Lycabettus]], of a French scientific institution, in the form of the [[French School at Athens]].

{{nihongo|'''Noriaki Fukuyama'''|福山 伯明|Fukuyama Noriaki|extra=1912 – 1946}} was a Japanese botanist and orchidologist. He died in [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref name=ntuh&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://culture.teldap.tw/culture/index.php?option=com_content&amp;id=871 |title=Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History |work=Digital Archives Project |publisher=[[National Taiwan University]] Herbarium |accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his short life, Dr. Fukuyama described over a hundred new species of [[orchid]]s from [[Micronesia]], the [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyus]] and Taiwan. Most of the type specimens he collected were housed in his personal [[herbarium]] (Herb. Orch. Fuk.), located in Taiwan, and were previously believed to have been lost amid the upheaval in [[Japan]] following the close of [[World War II]]. However, most of Fukuyama's type materials of Taiwan orchids were rediscovered, in the course of sifting through the botanical collection of one [[Genkei Masamune|Dr. Genkei Masamune]], which Masamune had bequeathed to the herbarium of the [[Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History]] upon his death in 1993. Although it is not entirely clear as to why he had them, it is known that Fukuyama had been Masamune's pupil.&lt;ref name=ntuh/&gt;

Among the materials found were Fukuyama's original manuscripts of ''Studia Orchidacearum Japonicarum'', Vols. XI thru XIII.&lt;ref name=ntuh/&gt;

Suffering from cancer, and plagued by local unrest in Taiwan against the Japanese, he was killed by locals in a nearby village during a local uprising against Japanese citizens living in Taiwan.

A '''paywall''' is a method of restricting access to [[content (media)|content]] via a paid [[subscription business model|subscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/07/here-are-6-reasons-why-newspapers-have-dropped-their-paywalls/|title=Are paywalls saving journalism?|website=City, University of London|author=Tom Felle|date= 2016-03-04|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.city.ac.uk/news/2016/march/are-paywalls-saving-journalism|title=Here are 6 reasons why newspapers have dropped their paywalls|url-access=limited|website=NiemanLab|author=Joseph Lichterman|date= 2016-07-20|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the mid-2010s, newspapers started implementing paywalls on their websites as a way to increase revenue after years of decline in paid print readership and advertising revenue.&lt;ref name="preston"&gt;{{cite news|last=Preston|first=Peter|title=A Paywall that pays? Only in America|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/aug/07/paywall-that-pays-only-in-america|accessdate=22 October 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In academics, [[Academic paper|research paper]]s are often subject to a paywall and are available via academic [[Library|libraries]] that subscribe.&lt;ref&gt;Sample, Ian.

Paywalls have also been used as a way of increasing the number of print subscribers; for example, some newspapers offer access to online content plus delivery of a Sunday print edition at a lower price than [[online]] access alone.&lt;ref name="rosen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Rebecca|title=Can a Paywall Stop Newspaper Subscribers From Canceling?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/09/can-a-paywall-stop-newspaper-subscribers-from-canceling/244932/|accessdate=12 October 2011|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper websites such as that of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' use this tactic because it increases both their online revenue and their print circulation (which in turn provides more ad [[revenue]]).&lt;ref name="rosen" /&gt;

== History ==

In 1996, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' set up and has continued to maintain a "hard" paywall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XnORAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=The+Wall+Street+Journal+online+version+since+1996#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal%20online%20version%20since%201996&amp;f=false|title=Online News and the Public|last=Salwen|first=Michael B.|last2=Garrison|first2=Bruce|last3=Driscoll|first3=Paul D.|date=2004-12-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135616793|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be widely read, acquiring over one million users by mid-2007,&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite news|title=The media's |newspaper= The Week|date=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 15 million visitors in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Whoah!

In 2010, following in the footsteps of ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''[[The Times]]'' (London) implemented a "hard" paywall; a decision which was controversial because, unlike ''The Wall Street Journal'', ''The Times'' is a general news site, and it was said that rather than paying, users would seek the information without charge elsewhere.&lt;ref name="crunch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wauters|first=Robin|title=Operation Failure: Times Plans To Charge For One-Day Access To Online News|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/17/times-online-24-hour-access/|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=Tech Crunch|date=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paywall was deemed in practice to be neither a success nor a failure, having recruited 105,000 paying visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schonfeld|first=Erick|title=The Times UK Lost 4 Million Readers To Its Paywall Experiment|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/02/times-paywall-4-million-readers/|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=Tech Crunch|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast ''[[The Guardian]]'' resisted the use of a paywall, citing "a belief in an open Internet" and "care in the community" as its reasoning – an explanation found in its welcome article to online news readers who, blocked from ''The Times’s'' site following the implementation of their paywall, came to ''The Guardian'' for online news.&lt;ref name="welcome"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crace|first=John|title=A warm welcome to guardian.co.uk for all former readers of the Times|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/jul/02/welcome-to-guardian-co-uk-for-former-times-readers|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 July 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' since experimented with other revenue-increasing ventures such as open API. Other papers, prominently ''[[The New York Times]]'', have oscillated between the implementation and removal of various paywalls.&lt;ref name="nov 3"&gt;{{cite news|last=Greenslade|first=Anne|title= Stop taking the ‘paywall pill’ by pioneering new forms of online revenue|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2011/nov/03/paywalls-us-press-publishing?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because online news remains a relatively new medium, it  has been suggested that experimentation is key to maintaining revenue while keeping online news consumers satisfied.&lt;ref name="Vinter" /&gt;

Some implementations of paywalls proved unsuccessful, and have been removed.&lt;ref name="Five Failed" /&gt; Experts who are skeptical of the paywall model include [[Arianna Huffington]], who declared "the paywall is history" in a 2009 article in ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;Huffington, Arianna (11 May 2009), [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/11/newspapers-web-media-pay-wall "The Paywall Is History"], ''The Guardian'' (London). Retrieved 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[Wikipedia]] co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] reportedly called ''The Times's'' paywall "a foolish experiment."&lt;ref name="jimmy"&gt;{{cite news|last=MacMillan|first=Gordon|title=Times paywall is a "foolish experiment" that won’t last, says Wikipedia founder|url=http://wallblog.co.uk/2010/08/10/times-paywall-is-a-foolish-experiment-that-wont-last-says-wikiepdia-founder/|accessdate=13 October 2011|newspaper=The Wall|date=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major concern was that, with content so widely available, potential subscribers would turn to free sources for their news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chimbel|first=Aaron|title=The paywall debate: the challenge of charging|journal=The Online Journalism Review|date=17 March 2011|url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/people/AaronChimbel/201103/1954/|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adverse effects of earlier implementations included decline in traffic&lt;ref name=EdPub&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milstead|first=David|title=Newspapers' Perilous Paywall Moment|journal=Editor &amp; Publisher|date=8 October 2010|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Article/Newspapers-Perilous-Paywall-Moment|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poor search engine optimization.&lt;ref name="Five Failed" /&gt;

Paywalls have become controversial, with partisans arguing over the effectiveness of paywalls in generating revenue and their effect on media in general.  Critics of paywalls include many businesspeople, academics such as media professor Jay Rosen, and journalists such as Howard Owens and media analyst Matthew Ingram of GigaOm.  Those who see potential in paywalls include investor [[Warren Buffett]], former  ''Wall Street Journal'' publisher Gordon Crovitz, and media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]].  Some have changed their opinions of paywalls.  Felix Salmon of Reuters was initially an outspoken skeptic of paywalls, but later expressed the opinion that they could be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Salmon|first=Felix|title=The NYT Paywall is Working|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/07/26/the-nyt-paywall-is-working/|accessdate=2 June 2012|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A NYU media theorist, Clay Shirky, was initially a skeptic of paywalls, but in May 2012 wrote, "[Newspapers] should turn to their most loyal readers for income, via a digital subscription service of the sort the [New York Times]" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shirky|first=Clay|title=WaPo must transform to survive|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/wapo_must_transform_to_survive.php|publisher=Columbia Journalism Review|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chittum|first=Ryan|title=Responding to Clay Shirky on the Washington Post|url=http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/responding_to_shirky_on_the_wa.php|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paywalls are rapidly changing journalism, with an impact on its practice and business model, and on [[freedom of information]] on the Internet, that is yet unclear.

== Types ==
Three high level models of paywall have emerged: ''hard paywalls'' that allow no free content and prompt the user straight away to pay in order to read, listen or watch the content, ''soft paywalls'' that allow some free content, such as an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]] or summary, and ''metered paywalls'' that allow a set number of free articles that a reader can access over a specific period of time, allow more flexibility in what users can view without subscribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pickard|first1=Victor|last2=T. Williams |first2=Alex|date=2014-04-03|title=Salvation or Folly? The Promises and Perils of Digital Paywalls|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1439&amp;context=asc_papers|journal=Digital journalism|volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=195–213|doi=10.1080/21670811.2013.865967 |access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Hard" paywalls ===

The "hard" paywall, as used by ''[[The Times]]'', requires paid subscription before any of their online content can be accessed. A paywall of this design is considered the riskiest option for the content provider.&lt;ref name="filloux"&gt;{{cite news|last=Filloux|first=Frederick|title=Analyzing the metered model|url=http://www.mondaynote.com/2011/06/05/analyzing-the-metered-model/|accessdate=13 October 2011|newspaper=Monday Note|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that a website will lose 90% of its online audience and ad revenue only to gain it back through its ability to produce online content appealing enough to attract subscribers.&lt;ref name="filloux" /&gt; News sites with "hard" paywalls can succeed if they:
*Provide added value to their content
*Target a niche audience
*Already dominate their own market&lt;ref name="filloux" /&gt;
Many experts denounce the "hard" paywall because of its inflexibility, believing it acts as a major deterrent for users. Financial blogger Felix Salmon wrote that when one encounters a "paywall and can’t get past it, you simply go away and feel disappointed in your experience."&lt;ref name="Salmon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Salmon|first=Felix|title=How The New York Times Paywall Is Working|url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/08/new-york-times-paywall/|accessdate=15 October 2011|newspaper=Wired|date=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jimmy Wales]], founder of the [[online encyclopedia]] [[Wikipedia]], argued that the use of a "hard" paywall diminishes a site's influence. Wales stated that, by implementing a "hard" paywall, ''The Times'' "made itself irrelevant."&lt;ref name="jimmy" /&gt; Though the ''Times'' had potentially increased its revenue, it decreased its traffic by 60%.&lt;ref name="crunch" /&gt;

=== "Soft" paywalls ===
The "soft" paywall is best embodied by the metered model. The metered paywall allows users to view a specific number of articles before requiring paid subscription.&lt;ref name="filloux" /&gt; In contrast to sites allowing access to select content outside the paywall, the metered paywall allows access to any article as long as the user has not surpassed the set limit. The ''Financial Times'' allows users to access 10 articles before becoming paid subscribers.&lt;ref name="filloux" /&gt; ''The New York Times'' controversially&lt;ref name="preston" /&gt; implemented a metered paywall in March 2011 which let users view 20 free articles a month before paid subscription. In April 2012 ''New York Times'' reduced the number of free articles per month to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=MEMMOTT|first=MARK|title=NYTimes.com Cuts Free Articles To 10 Per Month, From 20|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/03/20/148998882/nytimes-com-cuts-free-articles-to-10-per-month-from-20|publisher=NPR.org|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their metered paywall has been defined as not only soft, but "porous,"&lt;ref name="Salmon" /&gt; because it also allows access to any link posted on a social media site, and up to 25 free articles a day if accessed through a search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Indvik|first=Lauren|title=How To Hack the New York Times Paywall … With Your Delete Key|url=http://mashable.com/2011/03/28/how-to-bypass-new-york-times-paywall/|accessdate=13 October 2011|newspaper=Wired|date=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model is designed to allow the paper to "retain traffic from light users", which in turn allows the paper to keep their number of visitors high, while receiving circulation revenue from the site's heavy users.&lt;ref name=newsessay&gt;{{cite web|last=Edmonds|first=Rick|title=Newspapers: Missed the 2010 Media Rally|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2011/newspapers-essay/|work=The State of News Media 2011|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using this model ''The New York Times'' garnered 224,000 subscribers in the first three months.&lt;ref name="preston" /&gt; While many proclaimed ''The New York Times''{{'}} paywall a success after it reported a profit in the third quarter of 2011, the profit increase is said to be "ephemeral" and "largely based on a combination of cutbacks and the sale of assets."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Anne|title= Truth and Contradictions: The Global New Industry Looks to the Future|url=https://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2011/11/truth-and-contradictions-the-global-news-industry-looks-to-the-future325.html|accessdate=23 November 2011|newspaper=Media Shift|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the success of a metered paywall would create revenue for the newspaper and increased freedom for the public, the profitability of the metered model has yet to be sufficiently proven.

=== Combination ===
A "softer" paywall strategy includes allowing free access to select content, while keeping premium content behind a paywall. Such a strategy has been said to lead to "the creation of two categories: cheap fodder available for free (often created by junior staffers), and more 'noble' content."&lt;ref name="filloux" /&gt; This type of separation brings into question the egalitarianism of the online news medium. According to political and media theorist Robert A Hackett, "the commercial press of the 1800s, the modern world’s first mass medium, was born with a profound democratic promise: to present information without fear or favour, to make it accessible to everyone, and to foster public rationality based on equal access to relevant facts.".&lt;ref name="hackett"&gt;{{cite book|title=Democratic Equality: What went wrong?|year=2001|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=197–211|author=Robert A. Hackett|authorlink=The News Media and Civic Equality: Watch Dogs, Mad Dogs or Lap Dogs?|editor=Ed Broadbent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' implemented a version of this strategy in September 2011 by launching a second website, BostonGlobe.com, to solely offer content from the paper behind a hard paywall, aside from most sports content, which was kept open to compete against other local sports websites. BostonGlobe.com operates alongside a second, pre-existing news website [[Boston.com]], which now only contains a limited amount of content from the subscription website on a delay, but carries a larger focus on community-oriented news. ''The Boston Globe'' editor Martin Baron described them as "two different sites for two different kinds of reader – some understand [that] journalism needs to be funded and paid for. Other people just won't pay. We have a site for them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kramer|first=Staci|title=BostonGlobe.Com Launches Today; Shifts To Paying Subscribers Only Oct. 1|url=https://gigaom.com/2011/09/12/419-bostonglobe-com-launches-today-shifts-to-subscribers-only-oct-1/|work=PaidContent|publisher=Gigaom|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2014 the site had over 60,000 digital subscribers; at that time, the ''Globe'' announced that it would replace the hard paywall with a metered system allowing users to read 10 articles without charge in any 30-day period. ''The Boston Globe'' editor Brian McGrory believed that an ability to sample the site's premium content would encourage more people to subscribe to the service. At the same time, McGrory also announced plans to give Boston.com a more distinct editorial focus, with a "sharper voice that better captures the sensibilities of Boston", while migrating other content by ''Globe'' writers, such as blogs from Boston.com to the paper's website, but keeping them freely available.&lt;ref name=poynter-bostonglobesoftwall&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston Globe drops paywall, adds meter instead|url=http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/242132/boston-globe-drops-paywall-adds-meter-instead/|website=Poynter|accessdate=3 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128121226/http://www.poynter.org/news/mediawire/242132/boston-globe-drops-paywall-adds-meter-instead/|archivedate=28 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Industry ===
Professional reception to the implementation of paywalls has been mixed. Most discussion of paywalls centers on their success or failure as business ventures, and overlooks their ethical implications for maintaining an informed public. In the paywall debate there are those who see the implementation of a paywall as a "sandbag strategy" – a strategy which may help increase revenue in the short term, but not a strategy that will foster future growth for the newspaper industry.&lt;ref name="nov 3" /&gt; For the "hard" paywall specifically, however, there seems to be an industry consensus that the negative effects (loss of readership) outweigh the potential revenue, unless the newspaper targets a niche audience.&lt;ref name="filloux" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paywallstudy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Logan|first1=Donna|last2=Fletcher|first2=Fred|last3=Hermida|first3=Alfred|last4=Korell|first4=Darryl|title=Canadian Consumers Unwilling to Pay for News Online|url=http://www.cmrcccrm.ca/documents/CMRC_Paywall_Release.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410012049/http://www.cmrcccrm.ca/documents/CMRC_Paywall_Release.pdf|archivedate=2011-04-10|publisher=Canadian Media Research Consortium|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also those who remain optimistic about the use of paywalls to help revitalize floundering newspaper revenues. Those who believe implementing paywalls will succeed, however, continually buffer their opinion with contingencies. Bill Mitchell states that for a paywall to bring new revenue and not deter current readers, newspapers must: "invest in flexible systems, exploit their journalists' expertise in niche areas, and, crucially, offer readers their money's worth in terms of new value."&lt;ref name="Vinter" /&gt; The State of the News Media's 2011 annual report on American journalism makes the sweeping claim that: "[t]o survive financially, the consensus on the business side of news operations is that news sites not only need to make their advertising smarter, but they also need to find some way to charge for content and to invent new revenue streams other than display advertising and subscriptions."&lt;ref name="onlineessay"&gt;{{cite web|last=Olmstead|first=Kenny|title=Online: Key Questions Facing Digital News|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2011/online-essay/|work=The State of News Media 2011|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even those who do not believe in the general success of paywalls recognize that, for a profitable future, newspapers must start generating more attractive content with added value, or investigate new sources of earning revenue.&lt;ref name="nov 3" /&gt;

Proponents of the paywall believe that it may be crucial for smaller publications to stay afloat. They argue that since 90 percent of advertising revenues are concentrated in the top 50 publishers, smaller operations can't necessarily depend on the traditional ad-supported free content model the way that larger sites can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan|first=David|title=As Online Ad Revenue Remains Concentrated In Few Hands, Frustration Builds|url=https://gigaom.com/2007/10/12/419-as-online-ad-revenue-remains-concentrated-in-few-hands-frustration-buil/|date=13 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many paywall advocates also contend that people are more than willing to pay a small price for quality content.  In a March 2013 guest post for [[VentureBeat]], [[Malcolm CasSelle]] of MediaPass stated his belief that monetization would become "something of a self-fulfilling prophecy: people [will] pay for content, and that money goes back into making the overall content even better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CasSelle|first=Malcolm|title=How charging for premium content will save publishers from certain death|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/03/07/how-charging-for-premium-content-will-save-publishers-from-certain-death|date=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013 the [[News Media Alliance|Newspaper Association of America]] released its industry revenue profile for 2012, which reported that circulation revenue grew by 5 percent for dailies, making it the first year of circulation growth in ten years.   Digital-only circulation revenue reportedly grew 275%; print and digital bundled circulation revenue grew 499%.  Along with the shift towards bundling print and online into combined access subscriptions, print-only circulation revenue declined 14%.  This news corroborates a growing belief that digital subscriptions will be the key to securing the long-term survival of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The American Newspaper Media Industry Revenue Profile 2012|url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Newspaper-Revenue/Newspaper-Media-Industry-Revenue-Profile-2012.aspx|publisher=Newspaper Association of America|accessdate=9 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130410045634/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Newspaper-Revenue/Newspaper-Media-Industry-Revenue-Profile-2012.aspx|archivedate=10 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sneed|first=Tierney|title=Pay Walls Could Be Print's Salvation Online|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/04/09/pay-walls-could-be-prints-salvation-online|accessdate=9 April 2013|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reader ===
General user response to the implementation of paywalls has been measured through a number of recent studies which analyze readers' online news-reading habits. A study completed by the [[Canadian Media Research Consortium]] entitled "Canadian Consumers Unwilling to Pay for News Online", directly identifies the Canadian response to paywalls. Surveying 1,700 Canadians, the study found that 92% of participants who read the news online would rather find a free alternative than pay for their preferred site (in comparison to 82% of Americans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reagan|first=Gillian|title= PEW: 82% Of Users Will Abandon Their Favorite News Site If They Put Up A Paywall|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/pew-82-of-users-will-abandon-their-favorite-news-site-if-they-put-up-a-paywall-2010-3|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=Business Insider|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while 81% stated that they would absolutely not pay for their preferred online news site.&lt;ref name="paywallrelease"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Canadians unwilling to pay for news online, study suggests|url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2011/04/12/most-canadians-unwilling-to-pay-for-news-online-study-suggests/|work=The State of News Media 2011|publisher=Public Affairs|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on the poor reception of [[paid content]] by the participants, the study concludes with a statement similar to those of the media experts, stating, with the exception of prominent papers such as ''The Wall Street Journal'' and ''The Times'', that given the "current public attitudes, most publishers had better start looking elsewhere for revenue solutions."&lt;ref name="paywallstudy" /&gt;

== Ethical implications ==

=== Deterioration of the online public sphere ===
Hackett argues that a "forum on the internet [...] can function as a specialized or smaller-scale public sphere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=Robert A|title=Remaking Media: The Struggle to Democratize Public Communication|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the internet has been an ideal location for the general public to gather and discuss relevant news issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gans|first=Herbert J|title=Democracy and the News|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Cary|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an activity made accessible first through free access to online news content, and subsequently the ability to comment on the content, creating a forum. Erecting a paywall restricts the public’s open communication with one another by restricting the ability to both read and share online news.

The obvious way in which a paywall restricts equal access to the online public sphere is through requiring payment, deterring those who do not want to pay, and barring those who cannot from joining the online discussion. The restriction of equal access was taken to a new extreme when the UK's ''[[The Independent]]'' in October 2011 placed a paywall on foreign readers only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweeney|first=Mark|title= Independent website to launch paywall for non-UK readers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/10/independent-website-paywall-non-uk-readers|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online news media have the proven ability to create global connection beyond the typical reach of a public sphere. In ''Democratizing Global Media,'' Hackett and global communications theorist Yuezhi Zhao describe how a new "wave of media democratization arises in the era of the internet which has facilitated transnational civil society networks of and for democratic communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=Robert A|title=Democratizing Global Media: One World, Many Struggles|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By placing a paywall on their international readers, ''The Independent'' hinders the growth and democratic quality of the public sphere created by the internet.

The use of paywalls has also received many complaints from online news readers regarding an online subscriptions' inability to be shared like a traditional printed paper.  While a printed paper can be shared among friends and family, the ethics behind sharing an online subscription are less clear because there is no physical object involved. ''The New York Times''' "ethicist" columnist, Ariel Kaminer, addressing the question of sharing online subscription, states that "sharing with your spouse or young child is one thing; sharing with friends or family who live elsewhere is another."&lt;ref name="kaminer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaminer|first=Ariel|title=The Pay Wall’s the Thing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/magazine/mag-24Ethicist-t.html?_r=2|accessdate=17 October 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reader comments following Kaminer's response focus on the dichotomy between paying for a printed paper and paying for an online subscription.&lt;ref name="kaminer" /&gt; A printed paper's ease of access meant that more individuals could read a single copy, and that everyone who read the paper had the ability to send a letter to the editor without the hassle of registering or paying for the subscription. As such, the use of a paywall closes off the communication in both the personal realm and online. This opinion is not just held by online news readers, but also by opinion writers. Jimmy Wales comments that he "would rather write [an opinion piece] where it is going to be read", declaring that "putting opinion pieces behind paywalls [makes] no sense."&lt;ref name="jimmy" /&gt; Without easy access to both read and share insights and opinions, the online news platform loses an essential characteristic of democratic exchange.

=== Paying to stay informed ===
The use of a paywall to bar individuals from accessing news content online without payment, brings up numerous ethical questions. According to Hackett, media are already "failing to furnish citizens with ready access to relevant civic information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=Robert A|title=Remaking Media: The Struggle to Democratize Public Communication|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of paywalls on previously free news content heightens this failure through intentional withholding. Hackett cites "general cultural and economic mechanisms, such as the [[commodification]] of information and the dependence of commercial media on advertising revenue" as two of the greatest influences on media performance. According to Hackett, these cultural and economic mechanisms "generate violations of the democratic norm of equality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hackett|first=Robert A|title=Remaking Media: The Struggle to Democratize Public Communication|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of a paywall addresses and intimately ties the two mechanisms cited by Hackett, as the paywall commodifies news content to bring in revenue from both readers and from increased circulation of printed paper’s ads. The result of these mechanisms, as stated by Hackett, is an impediment to "equal access to relevant [news] facts."&lt;ref name="hackett" /&gt;
The commodification of information–making news into a product that must be purchased–restricts the egalitarian founding principal of the newspaper. Editor’s Weblog reporter Katherine Travers, addressing this issue in a post discussing the future of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', asks, "is digital subscription as permissible as charging a couple of dollars now and then for a paper copy?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Katherine|title=Pexton, The Post, and the Paywall|url=http://www.editorsweblog.org/newsrooms_and_journalism/2011/08/pexton_thepost_and_the_pay-wall.php|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=Gigaom|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While subscription fees have long been attached to print newspapers, all other forms of news have traditionally been free.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Andrews|first=Robert|title= Mail Online Readers Say They Will Pay, But They Won’t be forced to|url=https://gigaom.com/2011/11/23/419-mail-online-readers-say-they-will-pay-but-they-wont-be-forced-to/|accessdate=24 November 2011|newspaper=Paid Content|date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's ''[[Daily Mail]]'' argues that print revenue is unique because "people pay for the convenience of print in recognition of the special cost of production and delivery of a tangible product and because they purchase it whole."&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; Online news, in comparison has existed as a medium of free dissemination. Poynter digital media fellow Jeff Sonderman outlines the ethical tension created by a paywall. Sonderman explains that "[t]he underlying tension is that newspapers act simultaneously as businesses and as servants of the public’s interest. As for-profit enterprises, they have the right (the duty, even) to make money for shareholders or private owners. But most also claim to have a social compact, in which they safeguard the entire public interest and help their entire community shape and understand its shared values."&lt;ref name="s"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sonderman|first=Jeff|title=Why floods couldn’t break through Pennsylvania paywall, while New York Times created leaks in theirs|url=http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/149263/why-floods-couldnt-break-through-pennsylvania-paywall-while-new-york-times-created-leaks-in-theirs/|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=Poynter|date=12 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114094424/http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/top-stories/149263/why-floods-couldnt-break-through-pennsylvania-paywall-while-new-york-times-created-leaks-in-theirs/|archivedate=14 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By implementing a paywall before experimenting with other revenue-increasing initiatives, a newspaper arguably puts profit before the public.

== Counter strategies ==

While there has been little coverage and discussion of the ethical implications of the paywall regarding newspapers' obligation to maintain a generally informed public, there are two prominent instances where companies have addressed the restriction of online news coverage. First is the removal of paywalls in the face of breaking news (news covering national or local emergencies). Second is Google’s "[http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2008/10/first-click-free-for-web-search.html First Click Free]" application, which news providers can implement if they wish to make news stories of interest accessible to readers regardless of a paywall.

=== Disabling the paywall ===
Some newspapers have removed their paywall from blocking content covering emergencies. When [[Hurricane Irene]] hit the United States' east coast in late August 2011, ''The New York Times'' declared that all storm related coverage, accessed both online and through mobile devices, would be free to readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Owen|first=Laura Hazard|title= Hurricane Irene Knocks Down Paywalls|url=https://gigaom.com/2011/08/26/419-hurricane-irene-knocks-down-paywalls/|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=Paid Content|date=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times''‌' assistant managing editor, Jeff Roberts, discusses the paper's decision, stating: "[w]e are aware of our obligations to our audience and to the public at large when there is a big story that directly impacts such a large portion of people."&lt;ref name="s" /&gt; In his article discussing the removal of paywalls, Soderman commends ''The New York Times''' action, stating that, while a publisher "commits to a paywall as the best business strategy for his news company, there may be some stories or subjects which carry such importance and urgency that it is irresponsible to withhold them from nonsubscribers."&lt;ref name="s" /&gt;

=== New revenue initiatives ===
Given the overwhelming opinion that, regardless of paywall success, new revenue sources must be sought out for newspapers' financial success, it is important to highlight new business initiatives. According to [[Poynter Institute|Poynter]] media expert Bill Mitchell, in order for a paywall to generate sustainable revenue, newspapers must create "new value"—higher quality, innovation, etc.—in their online content that merits payment which previously free content did not.&lt;ref name="Vinter"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vinter|first=Hannah|title=Poynter's Bill Mitchell on paywalls — how to shape the paid experience|url=http://www.editorsweblog.org/analysis/2011/10/bill_mitchell_on_paywalls_-_how_to_shape.php|work=Editors Weblog|publisher=Web Editors Forum|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to erecting paywalls, newspapers have been increasingly exploiting tablet and mobile news products, the profitability of which remains inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenstiel|first=Tom|title=Survey: Mobile News &amp; Paying Online|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2011/mobile-survey/|work=The State of the News Media 2011|publisher=Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism|accessdate=12 October 2011|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reinan|first=John|title= Can paywalls and tablets save newspapers?|url=http://www.minnpost.com/johnreinan/2011/11/07/32882/can_paywalls_and_tablets_save_newspapers|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=Minn Post|date=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some newspapers have also embraced targeting niche audiences, such as the Daily Mail's Mail Online in the UK.&lt;ref name="Andrews" /&gt; Another strategy, pioneered by ''The New York Times'', involves creating new revenue by packaging old content in e-books and special feature offerings, to create an appealing product for readers. The draw of these packages is not just the topic but the authors and the breadth of coverage. According to reporter Mathew Ingram, newspapers can benefit from these special offerings in two ways, first by taking advantage of old content when new interest arises, such as an anniversary or an important event, and second, through the creation of packages of general interest. ''The New York Times'', for example, has created packages on baseball, golf and the digital revolution.(ebooks)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|title= Planning a paywall?

=== Alternative revenue initiative: API ===
An open [[Application programming interface|API]] (application programming interface) makes the online news site "a platform for data and information that [the newspaper company] can generate value from in other ways."&lt;ref name="nov 3" /&gt; Opening their API makes a newspaper's data available to outside sources, allowing developers and other services to make use of a paper's content for a fee.&lt;ref name="api"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|title=Don’t think of it as a newspaper – it’s a data platform|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/10/21/dont-think-of-it-as-a-newspaper-its-a-data-platform/|accessdate=16 November 2011|newspaper=Gigaom|date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'', in keeping with its "belief in an open internet",&lt;ref name="welcome" /&gt; has been experimenting with the use of API.&lt;ref name="nov 3" /&gt; ''The Guardian'' has created an "open platform" which works on a three level system:

#Base/Free – ''The Guardian'''s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ellis|first=Justin|title=Guardian CEOAndrew Miller on paywalls, mobile, and going global|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/01/guardian-ceo-andrew-miller-on-paywalls-mobile-and-going-global/|accessdate=10 February 2013|newspaper=Nieman Journalism Lab|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; content is free to anyone for personal and non-commercial uses
#Commercial – Commercial licenses are available for developers to use the API content if they agree to keep the associated advertising
#"Bespoke" Arrangement – Developers can partner with the newspaper, using specific data to create a service or an app, the revenue from which will be shared&lt;ref name="api" /&gt;

While an open API is regarded as a gamble just like a paywall, journalist Matthew Ingram ethically notes that the use of an open API aims at "profiting from the open exchange of information and other aspects of an online-media world, while the [paywall] is an attempt to create the kind of artificial information scarcity that newspapers used to enjoy."&lt;ref name="nov 3" /&gt; An open API keeps news content free to the public while the newspaper makes a profit from the quality and usefulness of its data to other businesses. The open API strategy can be commended because it takes the pressure off of the news room to continually investigate and explore new means of revenue. Instead, the open API strategy relies on the interest and ideas of those outside the newsroom, to whom the site's content and data are attractive.&lt;ref name="api" /&gt;

==Abandoned paywall initiatives==

;''The New York Times'' — TimesSelect
:The original online-subscription program, TimesSelect, was implemented in 2005 in an effort to create a new revenue stream.  TimesSelect charged $49.95 a year, or $7.95 a month, for online access to the newspaper's archives. In 2007, paid subscriptions were earning $10 million, but growth projections were low compared to the growth of online advertising.&lt;ref name="Five Failed" /&gt;  In 2007, ''The New York Times'' dropped the paywall to its post-1980 archive. Pre-1980 articles in [[PDF]] are still behind the paywall, but an abstract of most articles is available for free.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news |first= Richard|last= Pérez-Peña|authorlink= |title=Times to Stop Charging for Parts of Its Web Site. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/media/18times.html?ex=1347768000&amp;en=88011ab45717e39d&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink |quote=These indirect readers, unable to get access to articles behind the paywall and less likely to pay subscription fees than the more loyal direct users, were seen as opportunities for more page views and increased advertising revenue. |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=14 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;''[[The Atlantic]]''
:Originally online content was available only to print subscribers. This changed in 2008 under the supervision of James Bennet, editor-in-chief, in an effort to rebrand the magazine into a multi-platform business.&lt;ref name="Five Failed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Failed Paywalls and What We Can Learn from Them|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/failed-paywalls-2010-4|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=25 October 2011|author=Gillian Reagan and Lauren Hatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Johnston Press]]
:In November 2009, the UK regional publisher of over 300 titles erected paywalls on six local newspapers' websites, including ''Carrick Gazette'' and the ''[[Whitby Gazette]]''. The model was dropped in March 2010; paid subscriber growth during the 4-month period was reportedly in the low double-digits.&lt;ref name="Five Failed" /&gt;

;[[Ogden Newspapers]]
:Throughout 2014, Ogden Newspapers' daily newspapers were placed behind a paywall. The system displayed teaser headlines and the first paragraph of the story. Paid subscribers had access to an e-edition of the newspapers as well as access to the publications via smart phone and tablet apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-journal.com/allaccess/|title=- News, Sports, Jobs - Post Journal|publisher=|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogden's papers began removing the paywall in November 2016, in conjunction with launching redesigned, mobile and tablet friendly websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-journal.com/news/page-one/2016/11/redesigned-website-launches/ Redesigned website launches].

'''Cognitive planning''' is one of the [[executive function]]s. It encompasses the [[neurological]] processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies utilizing a combination of [[neuropsychological]], neuropharmacological and functional [[neuroimaging]] approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the [[frontal lobe]].

A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as [[working memory]].

Disruption of the [[neural pathway]]s, via various mechanisms such as [[traumatic brain injury]], or the effects of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s between this area of the frontal cortex and the [[basal ganglia]] specifically the [[striatum]] (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9421831 | volume=53 | issue=4 | title=Cognitive planning in humans: neuropsychological, neuroanatomical and neuropharmacological perspectives | date=November 1997 | journal=Prog.

==Neuropsychological tests==
[[File:Tower of Hanoi 4.gif|thumb|right|Animation of a four disc version of the [[Tower of Hanoi]].|alt=A version of the Tower of Hanoi utilizing four discs.]]
There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls.

*'''[[Tower of Hanoi]]''' (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are variations of the puzzle - the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine  discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules:
**Only one disk may be moved at a time.
**Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod.
**No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Welsh | first1 = MC | last2 = Huizinga | first2 = M | date = June 2001 | title = The development and preliminary validation of the Tower of Hanoi-revised | url = | journal = Assessment | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 167–76 | pmid = 11428696 | doi=10.1177/107319110100800205}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = JR | last2 = Albert | first2 = MV | last3 = Fincham | first3 = JM | date = August 2005 | title = Tracing problem solving in real time: fMRI analysis of the subject-paced Tower of Hanoi | url = | journal = J Cogn Neurosci | volume = 17 | issue = 8| pages = 1261–74 | doi = 10.1162/0898929055002427 | pmid = 16197682 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Tower of London test|Tower of London]]''' (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1982 (Shallice 1982) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe.  test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution).

In test, participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional [[cerebral blood flow]] to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area, i.e. subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Little reliable published information exists describing Rife's life and work. In the 1930s, he made several [[Optical_microscope#Compound_microscope|optical compound microscope]]s and using a movie camera, took [[time-lapse microscopy]] movies of microbes.&lt;ref name="PopSci_June1931"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/11/22/archives/bacilli-revealed-by-new-microscope-dr-rifes-apparatus-magnifying.html?sq=royal+rife&amp;scp=2&amp;st=p| title=Bacilli Revealed by New Microscope; Dr. Rife's Apparatus, Magnifying 17,000 Times, Shows Germs Never Before Seen.| newspaper = The New York Times| date = November 22, 1931| page = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution |date=1944 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |page=207ff |url=https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/annualreportofbo1944smit |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also built microscopes that included [[polarizer]]s.&lt;ref name=CaWest&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kendall | first = Arthur Isaac, MD., PhD.| authorlink = | author2 = Rife, Royal, PhD. | title = Observations On Bacillus Typhosus In Its Filterable State: A Preliminary Communication | journal = California and Western Medicine | volume = XXXV | issue = 6 | pages = 409–11| publisher = | location = | date = December 1931| doi =  | pmc=1658030 | pmid=18741967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rife also reported that a 'beam ray' device of his invention could destroy the pathogens.&lt;ref name="PopSci_June1931"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewsPapers&gt;{{cite news
| last =Jones  | first =Newell   | title =Dread Disease Germs Destroyed By Rays, Claim Of S.D. Scientist: Cancer Blow Seen After 18-year Toil by Rife| page= 1 | publisher=San Diego Evening Tribune | date=1938-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rife claimed to have documented a "Mortal Oscillatory Rate" for various pathogenic organisms, and to be able to destroy the organisms by vibrating them at this particular rate. According to the ''San Diego Evening Tribune'' in 1938, Rife stopped short of claiming that he could cure cancer, but did argue that he could "devitalize disease organisms" in living tissue, "with certain exceptions".&lt;ref name=NewsPapers/&gt;  
[[File:Oryg rife.jpg|thumb|Rife machine from 1922]]

Rife's claims about his beam ray could not be [[reproducibility|independently replicated]], and were discredited by independent researchers during the 1950s.&lt;ref name="acs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 December 2000 |title=Cheating death |url=http://www.healthwatcher.net/quackerywatch/Cancer/Cancer-news/smh001230rife-aus.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j0QBaB4Q?url=http://www.healthwatcher.net/quackerywatch/Cancer/Cancer-news/smh001230rife-aus.html |archivedate=14 July 2016 |deadurl=no |quote=Although unanimously condemned as worthless |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An obituary in the ''[[Daily Californian]]'' described his death at the age of 83 on August 5, 1971, stating that he died penniless and embittered by the failure of his devices to garner scientific acceptance.&lt;ref name="daily-californian"/&gt;  Rife blamed the scientific rejection of his claims on a [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] involving the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA), the Department of Public Health, and other elements of "organized medicine", which had "brainwashed and intimidated" his colleagues.&lt;ref name="daily-californian"&gt;{{cite news |author=Del Hood| title = Scientific Genius Dies: Saw Work Discredited | work = [[Daily Californian]] | date = August 11, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in Rife's claims was revived in some [[alternative medicine|alternative medical]] circles by the 1987 book by Barry Lynes, ''The Cancer Cure That Worked'', which claimed that Rife had succeeded in curing cancer, but that his work was suppressed by a powerful conspiracy headed by the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name="acs"&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Questionable methods of cancer management: electronic devices |journal=CA Cancer J Clin |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=115–27 |year=1994 | url =http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.44.2.115/abstract |pmid=8124604 |doi=10.3322/canjclin.44.2.115|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this book's publication, a variety of devices bearing Rife's name were marketed as cures for diverse diseases such as cancer and [[AIDS]]. An analysis by ''[[Electronics Australia]]'' found that a typical 'Rife device' consisted of a [[PP3 battery|nine-volt battery]], wiring, a switch, a timer and two short lengths of copper tubing, which delivered an "almost undetectable" current unlikely to penetrate the skin.&lt;ref name="SMH"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://healthwatcher.net/Quackerywatch/Cancer/Cancer-news/smh001230rife-aus.html | title = Cheating Death | first = Ben | last = Hills | work= [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 2000-12-30 | accessdate = 2009-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such 'Rife devices' have figured prominently in several cases of [[health fraud]] in the U.S., typically centered around the uselessness of the devices and the grandiose claims with which they are marketed. In a 1996 case, the marketers of a 'Rife device' claiming to cure numerous diseases including cancer and AIDS were convicted of felony health fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1370/is_n7_v30/ai_18656599/ |title = Investigators' Reports | work = [[FDA Consumer]] | publisher = [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date = September 1996 | accessdate = 2009-08-07 | first=Dixie | last=Farley|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18656599.html|archivedate=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentencing judge described them as "target[ing] the most vulnerable people, including those suffering from terminal disease" and providing false hope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/796_irs.html  |title = Investigators' Reports | work =  [[FDA Consumer]] | publisher = [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] | date = September 1996 | accessdate = 2009-01-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071214170405/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/796_irs.html |archivedate = 2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases cancer patients who ceased chemotherapy and instead used these devices have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/News/rife.html|author=Stephen Barrett|authorlink=Stephen Barrett|title=Rife Machine Operator Sued|accessdate=2007-02-12|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stimes"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20071221&amp;slug=indictment21m | title = Pair indicted on fraud charges in medical-device probe | first = Christine | last = Willmsen | author2 = Michael J. Berens | publisher = ''[[Seattle Times]]'' | date = 2007-12-21 | accessdate = 2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rife devices are currently classified as a subset of [[radionics]] devices, which are generally viewed as pseudomedicine by mainstream experts.&lt;ref name="acs"/&gt; In Australia, the use of Rife machines has been blamed for the deaths of cancer patients who might have been cured with conventional therapy.&lt;ref name="SMH" /&gt;  In 2002 John Bryon Krueger, who operated the Royal Rife Research Society, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in a murder and also received a concurrent 30-month sentence for illegally selling Rife devices. In 2009 a U.S. court convicted James Folsom of 26 felony counts for sale of the Rife devices sold as 'NatureTronics', 'AstroPulse', 'BioSolutions', 'Energy Wellness', and 'Global Wellness'.&lt;ref name=DW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devicewatch.org/reports/rife/folsom.shtml|author=Stephen Barrett|authorlink=Stephen Barrett|title=Rife Device Marketers Convicted|accessdate=2009-08-07|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[American Cancer Society]] reported that Rife machines were being sold in a "pyramid-like, multilevel marketing scheme". A key component in the marketing of Rife devices has been the claim, initially put forward by Rife himself, that the devices were being suppressed by an establishment conspiracy against cancer "cures".&lt;ref name="acs"/&gt; The ACS describes Lynes' claims as implausible, noting that the book was written "in a style typical of conspiratorial theorists" and defied any independent verification.&lt;ref name="acs"/&gt;  Although 'Rife devices' are not registered by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] and have been linked to deaths among cancer sufferers, the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' reported that over 300 people attended the 2006 Rife International Health Conference in [[Seattle]], where dozens of unregistered devices were sold.&lt;ref name="stimes"/&gt;

'''Stanley B. Mulaik''' (September 30, 1902 – March 17, 1995) was an American zoologist and educator. He was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] to Lithuanian parents. He received a bachelor's degree in science education and worked as a school teacher for several years until commencing his PhD studies at the [[University of Utah]] in 1939. His dissertation presented several new species and genera of [[isopods]] and demonstrated that isopods were native to the Americas, rather than introduced from the Old World as previously thought.

He was appointed as an assistant (and later associate) professor at the University of Utah, where he taught courses in nature study, conservation, the teaching of biology, museum techniques, and arthropod anatomy. He was elected a fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], and was a Director of the [[Conservation Education Association]] from 1954 to 1957.

He was jointly or separately involved in describing over 200 new species of spiders, isopods, scorpions and mites. For his taxonomic work he often collaborated with his wife Dorothea D. Mulaik (1900-1996). The Mulaiks are commemorated in the names of several organisms, including nine spider species from Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dean|first1=David A.|title=Catalogue of Texas spiders|journal=ZooKeys|date=2 March 2016|volume=570|pages=1–703|doi=10.3897/zookeys.570.6095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="674">'''Thanatocoensis''' (from [[Greek language]] ''thanatos'' - death and ''koinos'' - common) are all the embedded [[fossil]]s at a single discovery site. This site may be referred to as a '''death assemblage'''. Such groupings are composed of fossils of organisms which may not have been associated during life, often originating from different habitats. Examples include marine fossils having been brought together by a [[current (stream)|water current]] or animal bones having been deposited by a predator.

[[Image:Metric Marvels.png|thumb|right|The Metric Marvels, from left to right: Meter Man, Liter Leader, Wonder Gram and Super Celsius]]
'''''The Metric Marvels''''' is a series of seven [[animation|animated]] educational [[short film|shorts]] featuring songs about [[metre|meters]], [[litre|liters]], [[Celsius]], and [[gram]]s, designed to teach [[United States|American]] children how to use the [[metric system]]. They were produced by [[George Newall|Newall]] &amp; [[Tom Yohe|Yohe]], the same advertising agency which produced [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC's]] ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' series, and first aired on the [[NBC]] television network in September 1978. Voices for the Metric Marvels shorts included [[Lynn Ahrens]], [[Bob Dorough]], [[Bob Kaliban]], and [[Paul Winchell]].

== Origins ==
On December 23, 1975, President [[Gerald Ford]] signed the [[Metric Conversion Act]] into law; this act gave official sanction for the United States to convert to the metric system of measurement. (The United States uses the [[United States customary units|U.S. Customary system]], and not metric measurements.) Ford's presidential successor, [[Jimmy Carter]], began to implement this law in earnest, helping to set up the [[U.S. Metric Board]] as a task force to determine when and how the U.S. would [[Metrication in the United States|convert to metric]]. The USMB suggested that the transition ought to be voluntary and gradual, taking place over at least a ten-year period.

As part of this gradual transition, the USMB sponsored a number of [[public service announcement]]s on radio and television. ''The Metric Marvels'' was one such television PSA, aired during NBC's Saturday morning cartoons. The shorts featured four animated metric superheroes: '''Meter Man''', '''Liter Leader''', '''Super Celsius''' and '''Wonder Gram'''. Each superhero performed songs designed to teach children the difference between the old English system and the new metric system.

== Episodes ==
# "'''Meet Meter Man'''" / Superhero Meter Man helps people convert length and distance to metric terms
# "'''Mara-Mara-Marathon'''" / The difference between miles and kilometers
# "'''I'm Your Liter Leader'''" / Superhero Liter Leader explains the difference between gallons and liters
# "'''Eeny, Meeny, Miney Milliliters'''" / Liter Leader uses recipes to explain milliliters
# "'''Super Celsius'''" / Superhero Super Celsius explains the Celsius temperature scale
# "'''Wonder Gram'''" / Superhero Wonder Gram expresses her weight in grams
# "'''Wonder Baby'''" / A young Wonder Gram converts pounds to kilograms

== Legacy ==
Although it shared the animation style, song quality and voice actors of the more popular ''Schoolhouse Rock!'', the series had far fewer episodes and was relatively short-lived. (Being shown on another network from ''Schoolhouse Rock!'', and not having the benefit of airing within the context of that series in rotation, also hurt the series. Short-form animated clips such as these were typically [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s specialty, and NBC did not air such programs other than ''The Metric Marvels''.)

Ultimately, ''The Metric Marvels'' (along with all other U.S. efforts) failed to convince Americans to convert to the metric system. Americans largely ignored governmental attempts to push them in the direction of metrication and the USMB was eventually disbanded in 1982.

[[File:Accreting coast Image6.svg|thumb|360px|right|Tombolo contrasted with other coastal landforms.]]
A '''tombolo''', from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''tombolo'', derived from the [[Latin]] ''tumulus'', meaning 'mound', and sometimes translated as ''[[Ayre (landform)|ayre]]'', is a [[deposition (sediment)|deposition]] [[landform]] in which an island is attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a [[spit (landform)|spit]] or [[bar (landform)|bar]]. Once attached, the island is then known as a [[tied island]]. A tombolo is a sandy [[isthmus]].

Several islands tied together by bars which rise above the water level are called a '''tombolo cluster'''.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Geology and Related Sciences. The American Geological Institute, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;  Two or more tombolos may form an enclosure (called a [[lagoon]]) that can eventually fill with sediment.

[[File:2010-10-01 02-27-36 DSC 0354 Boris.jpg|thumb|The eastern end of [[Bennett Island]] with its [[glaciated]] tombolo in the background]]
The shoreline moves toward the island (or detached breakwater) due to accretion of sand in the lee of the island where wave energy and [[longshore drift]] are reduced and therefore deposition of sand occurs.
===Wave diffraction and refraction===
True tombolos are formed by [[ocean surface waves|wave]] [[refraction]] and [[diffraction]]. As waves near an island, they are slowed by the shallow water surrounding it. These waves then bend around the island to the opposite side as they approach. The wave pattern created by this water movement causes a convergence of [[longshore drift]] on the opposite side of the island. The beach sediments that are moving by lateral transport on the lee side of the island will accumulate there, conforming to the shape of the wave pattern. In other words, the waves sweep sediment together from both sides. Eventually, when enough sediment has built up, the beach shoreline, known as a spit, will connect with an island and form a tombolo.&lt;ref&gt;Easterbrook, Don T. Surface Processes and Landforms, Second Edition. 1999 Prentice Hall Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unidirectional longshore drift ===
In the case of [[longshore drift]] from one single or a dominant direction, like at [[Chesil Beach]] or [[Spurn Head]], the flow of material is along the coast in a movement which is not determined by the now [[tied island]], such as [[Isle of Portland|Portland]], which it has reached. In this and similar cases, while the strip of beach material connected to the Island may be technically called a tombolo because it links the island to the land, it is better thought of in terms of its formation – as a [[Spit (landform)|spit]] or otherwise.

==Morphology and sediment distribution==

Tombolos are more prone to natural fluctuations of profile and area as a result of tidal and weather events than a normal beach is. Because of this susceptibility to weathering, tombolos are sometimes made more sturdy through the construction of roads or parking lots. The sediments that make up a tombolo are coarser towards the bottom and finer towards the surface. It is easy to see this pattern when the waves are destructive and wash away finer grained material at the top, revealing coarser sands and cobbles as the base. 

[[Sea level#Changes through geologic time|Sea level rise]] may also contribute to accretion, as material is pushed up with rising sea levels. This is the case with [[Chesil Beach]] (which connects the [[Isle of Portland]] to [[Dorset]] in [[England]]), notable because the shingle ridge is parallel rather than at right angles to the coast.

Tombolos demonstrate the sensitivity of shorelines. A small piece of land, such as an island, can change the way that waves move, leading to different deposition of sediments.

[[Image:Limno2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The UPLB Limnological Research Station]]

The '''[[University of the Philippines, Los Baños|UPLB]] Limnological Research Station''' traces its root from the Department of Entomology, of the then '''UP College of Agriculture'''. Since its conception, the station contributed immensely to the understanding of the bounties of [[Laguna de Bay]] and helped establish the [[duck]] farming industry on Los Baňos foreshores and pioneered in aquarium fish production in the country. It serves as the base for studies on [[limnology]] and [[biology]] of aquatic organisms aimed at developing strategies for the optimum utilization and sustained production of aquatic resources; developing, adapting or improving conventional technologies used to increase fish production; and promoting environment friendly approaches for effective water management.

==History==
===Pre-War===
The idea of institutionalizing a Limnological Station began as a result of collaboration between Dr. Leopoldo B. Uichanco, professor and head of the Department of Entomology of the then UP College of Agriculture and [[Albert William Herre]], then Chief of Fisheries Division, Bureau of Science, Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources on ‘Dolong’, a species of goby that can be found in Laguna de Bay (Ref: Letter of Albert W. Herre to Dr. L.B. Uichangco dated January 19, 1926, UPLB LRS archive # 1). On August 17, 1928, the UP College of Agriculture Limnological Research and Aquatic Resources Management Center was established with Proclamation No. 176 signed by Governor General [[Henry L. Stimson]] (Gov. Gen from Dec. 27, 1927 to February 23, 1929) as its backbone and maintained as a facility under the Department of Entomology.

Under Dr. L.B. Uichangco’s diligent efforts, more researches on aquatic animals and more courses in [[Zoology]] were instituted. Dr. Deogracias V. Villadolid, upon his return after getting his Ph.D. in Aquatic Biology from [[Stanford University]] in 1927, Zoology was no longer a mere background to [[entomology]]. Dr. Villadolid, who became head of the station more than any other, was responsible for the enhanced development of fisheries in the Philippines. Dr. Villadolid together with Messrs. Andres M. Mane and F. Alonte eventually left the department in 1934 and transferred to the Bureau of Fisheries now known as the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) and served as its Director, and later became an aquatic biologist of the Fish and Game Administration (Gabriel, 1979), operations of the station naturally ceased.

Since then, work has not been resumed primarily due to lack of funds and low priority assigned to the activity in addition to the onset of World War II in 1941.

===World War II===
World War II brought the Department back to almost where it was in 1909. Cendana (1959) narrated that during the Japanese occupation, it was impossible to do any kind of research work. But instruction went on throughout the war years, although only two courses, Zoology 1 and Entomology 1, could be offered. During the end of war, retreating Japanese soldiers burned the Entomology Building on February 23, 1945. With it was burned everything that took the Department 32 years to accumulate including extensive insect and zoological collections, irreplaceable biological notes, valuable books and all the equipment.

===Post-War===
The [[UP College of Agriculture]] was re-opened in June 1945, with Dean L.B. Uichanco as the concurrent head of the Department of Entomology. Upon the establishment of the College of Arts and Humanities (renamed on October 28, 1977 College of Arts and Sciences) on December 21, 1972, Zoology became one of its seven initial departments. When the programs in Hydrozoology and Wildlife Zoology were instituted, the need to reactivate and bring the Station back to its real potentials consequently started. In 1975, an ad hoc committee for the reactivation of the Station was formed with Dr. Cesar P. Madamba of the Department of Zoology, CAS as Chairman. Members of the committee were Dr. W.P. David, Dr. B.L. Cariaso, Dr. B.P. Gabriel, Dr. V.J. Calilung and Dr. C.R. Barril. They initiated plans and activities for the research station at the University level. After the construction of the new Station, an ad hoc committee was formed to conceptualize research plans and other developments regarding aquatic resources management, also with Dr. Madamba as Chairman with the original five members of the reactivation committee and Mr. Batoon from ACCI as an addition. The Station was renamed UPLB Limnological Research Station.

At the time it was reserved, the Station ground directly bordered Laguna de Bay. However, there has been built up - as a result in part of the accumulation of sand and shell by constant wave action and in part of the recession of the lake's water - a foreshore accretion between the original reservation and the Lake. Since the Station's research activities in the waters of the Lake cannot very well be carried out without direct access to it, the Station's premises were extended, as the waters of the Lake receded, to this accretion area. Aware of the need for a Freshwater Research Center, then Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos proclaimed the Reservation Area under Proclamation No. 1678, thereby amending Proclamation No. 176, signed at UPLB on October 10, 1977 making the Station's total land area at 4.077 hectares.

===Present===
The UPLB Limnological Research Station (popularly called Limno Station or just Limno) is being managed by the Animal Biology Division, Institute of Biological Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences. The Station has a total land area of 4.78 ha. situated at the foreshore of Laguna de Bay in Barangay Mayondon, Los Baňos Laguna.

On January 28, 1994, the Station was identified and established as the National Center for Inland Waters Research and Development by the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development-Department of Science and Technology (PCAMRD-DOST). The Station is also the seat of PCAMRD-DOST's Southern Luzon Zonal Center for Aquatic and Marine R&amp;D (Zonal Center 2).

The UPLB Limnological Research Station once again plays an important role in the fisheries sector through the leadership of their Station Manager, Dr. Pablo P. Ocampo, paving the way towards achieving its goals to: (1) develop optimum utilization and sustained production of aquatic resources; (2) conduct limnological studies; (3) conduct training and extension activities on different aspects of aquarium fish production; (4) develop culture technique for live feeds; (5) develop new aquarium varieties from indigenous fish species; and, (6) conduct captive breeding on some selected endemic/endangered freshwater fish species.

'''Program Leader:''' Dr. Pablo P. Ocampo

Fish Ark Philippines: Direction for the Conservation of Native and Endemic Philippine Freshwater Fishes, a program funded by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) through the Philippine Council for Aquatic and Marine Research and Development (PCAMRD), with an overall objectives in line with the Philippine Strategy for Biological Conservation, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan and the Provisions No. 24 of Republic Act 9147 (otherwise known as the Philippine Conservation and Protection Act). The program will also address gaps in our knowledge of the species richness of freshwater aquatic fauna and inland ecosystems, particularly from inland waters.

The main goals of the program are the following: (1) to develop an equip aqua laboratory where threatened and endangered native or endemic freshwater fishes can be provided with safe refuge until such time that adequate and protected natural habitat can be established; (2) to establish a self-sustaining captive breeding program and produce adequate breeding stock as backup populations, and attempt to develop techniques to prepare animals for re-introduction; (3) to document the status of different freshwater species in the wild, and set priorities for species to be conserved or re-introduced; and, (4) to develop information delivery systems that would underscore conservation education and public awareness that can create local support necessary in sustaining re-introduction efforts.

The program has four component projects:
* Component Project I: Survey of Diminutive Freshwater Fishes Indigenous to Isolated Crater Lakes, Mountain Streams and Cataracts in Southern Luzon, Philippines
'''(Project Leader:''' Dr. Vachel Gay V. Paller)
* Component Project II: Captive Breeding of the Native and Endemic Diminutive Freshwater Fishes

A '''water stop'''  is a break and a place to break for drinking [[water]] in [[sports]] events ([[sports competition]]s or training) for some types of sports, such as various long distance types of [[running]] (e.g., [[marathon]]), [[cycling]], etc. Similarly, a '''water break''' is a break to drink water in some sports events held in one place. 

Water stops and breaks have become obligatory relatively recently. Before the 1950s, there had been a practice to eliminate water breaks in order "to toughen up boys" (see "[[Junction Boys]]" for an example).

Water stops are used to combat  interrelated dangers: [[hyperthermia]], [[dehydration]] and [[hyponatremia]] (low blood level of sodium). Drinking water combats dehydration, while intake of [[electrolyte]] solutions (often provided by various [[sports drink]]s) combats hyponatremia and its severe form, [[water intoxication]].

In a marathon, waters stops are usually at every [[5000 meters|5K]] or at every 2 miles, resulting in  8-12 stops. Stopping for 10 seconds per station results in 1-2 minutes of added time, but the loss of stamina due to dehydration would add much more.&lt;ref&gt;Scott M. Douglas, Peter D. Pfitzinger (2001) "Advanced Marathoning", {{ISBN|0-7360-3431-5}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to dehydration, hyponatremia is a relatively recently recognized danger, and there are different opinions about how much water to drink at each water stop. Some texts say that [[thirst]] is not a reliable indicator of the need in water,&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Gollin Evans (1997)  "An Outdoor Family Guide to Acadia National Park", {{ISBN|0-89886-528-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other say that obligatory drinking at every opportunity without real need increases the danger of hyponatremia. "If you hear sloshing in your stomach... you can by-pass that water stop". ([[Jeff Galloway]])&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Galloway (2002) Galloway's Book on Running, {{ISBN|0-936070-27-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3kqUP3upHQ4C&amp;pg=PA92&amp;dq=%22water+stop%22+dehydration&amp;ei=DCAMR9arD6C0pALXxYTTCA&amp;sig=Ms588-fjA6ibOXOzGPcC8O2z3aE p.92]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sumo]], if a bout goes for many minutes the referee may call a break traditionally called ''mizu-iri'' or "water break".
