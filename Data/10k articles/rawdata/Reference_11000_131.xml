      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42735">'''African Writers Series''' ('''AWS''') is a series of books by [[List of African writers (by country)|African writers]] that has been published by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]] since 1962. The series has ensured an international voice to major African writers—including [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[Steve Biko]], [[Ama Ata Aidoo]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Buchi Emecheta]], and [[Okot p'Bitek]]. The emphasis is on Anglophone Africa, although a number of volumes were translated into English from [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Acoli language|Acoli]], [[Sesotho]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Luganda]] and [[Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/acquisition-highlights/heinemann-african-writers-series "Heinemann African Writers Series"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429153937/http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/acquisition-highlights/heinemann-african-writers-series |date=April 29, 2015 }} at [[African Studies Centre, Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1962, the AWS created a forum for many post-independence African writers, and provided texts that African universities could use to address the colonial bias then prominent in the teaching of literature. The books were designed for classroom use, printed solely in paperback to make them affordable for African students. They were published by Heinemann Educational Books (HEB) in London and in various African cities.

The idea of the series came from Heinemann executive Alan Hill, who "recognised that the nascent post-colonial publishing industry was not supporting the growth of original African literature".&lt;ref&gt;Akin Ajayi, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/feb/16/africa-writers-series-penguin-heinemann "Books Blog: Penguin's African Writers Series is stuck in the past"], ''The Guardian'', 17 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalliney2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter J. Kalliney|title=Commonwealth of Letters: British Literary Culture and the Emergence of Postcolonial Aesthetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVq0oyc4JKwC&amp;pg=PA179|year=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-997797-0|pages=178–217|chapter=Metropolitan Publisher as Postcolonial Clearinghouse: The African Writers Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first advisory editor to the series was the [[Nigerian]] [[Chinua Achebe]] &amp;ndash; who became one of Africa's most famous writers. Achebe focused first on [[West Africa]]n writers, but soon the series branched out, publishing the works of Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in [[East Africa]], and Nadine Gordimer in [[South Africa]]. Achebe left the editorship in 1972. James Currey, the editorial director at Heinemann Educational Books in charge of the African Writers Series from 1967 to 1984, has provided a book-length treatment of the series entitled ''Africa Writes Back''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Mbele, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/cls/summary/v046/46.2.mbele.html "Africa Writes Back: The African Writers Series &amp; the Launch of African Literature (review)"], from ''Comparative Literature Studies'', Vol. 46, No. 2, 2009, pp. 425-428. Excerpted at Project Muse.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a fairly successful beginning, the series faced difficulties that mirrored those that faced the continent. By the mid-1980s, Heinemann published only one or two new titles a year, and much of the back catalogue fell out of print. By the early 1990s, however, the series began to revive—having recently branched into new work, republishing originally locally released texts, and releasing translated works. 

The AWS was relaunched by [[Pearson Education]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naijastories.com/2011/08/pearson-revives-african-writers-series-calls-for-submissions/ "Pearson revives African Writers Series, calls for submissions"], Naija Stories, 4 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Norbrook, [http://www.theafricareport.com/Books/publishing-africa-writers-series-celebrates-50-years.html "Publishing Africa Writers Series celebrates 50 years"], ''The Africa Report'', 29 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pearsonschoolsandfecolleges.co.uk/international/Africa/Secondary/EnglishLiterature/African%20Writers%20Series/AfricanWritersSeries/AfricanWritersSeries.aspx "A celebrated selection of literature from Africa"], Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antonine Barada''' (August 22, 1807 &amp;ndash; March 30, 1885), alternatively spelled '''Antoine Barada''', was an American [[folk hero]] in the state of [[Nebraska]]; son of an [[Omaha people|Omaha]] mother, he was also called '''Mo shi-no pazhi''' in the tribal language.&lt;ref name="Half-Breed Creek"&gt;Sandage, S.A. (2006) [http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/amersem/sandage.pdf "Half-Breed Creek"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Brown University. Retrieved 1/28/08.&lt;/ref&gt; While Barada was an historic man, contemporary accounts of his prodigious strength helped establish him as a regional legend, in the mold of [[Paul Bunyan]] and [[Febold Feboldson]].&lt;ref&gt;Suttle, J.K. [http://ioway.nativeweb.org/history/barada_antoine.htm "Antoine Barada"], Baxoje, The Ioway Nation website. Retrieved 1/26/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Barada's exploits have been counted as [[fakelore]] by historians.

== Early life ==
Antoine Barada was born in 1807 at [[St. Marys, Iowa]], which was once located across the Missouri River from [[Nemaha County, Nebraska]].  His parents were [[Michel Barada]], a French-American [[fur trapper]] and interpreter, and ''Ta-ing-the-hae,'' or "Laughing Buffalo", a full-blood [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]] and sister to the chief.&lt;ref name="Half-Breed Creek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suttle, J.K., "Antoine Barada", ''Daily Tribune'', Hastings, Nebraska; Monday, September 8, 1975; reprinted at [http://ioway.nativeweb.org/history/barada_antoine.htm "Antoine Barada"], ''Baxoje,'' The Ioway Nation website. Retrieved 1/26/08.&lt;/ref&gt; His namesake grandfather, [[Antoine Barada, Sr.]] (1739–1782), was born in [[Gascony, France]], and was one of the first settlers of [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

In 1813 Antoine was abducted by the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] while the family lived near [[Fort Lisa (Nebraska)]]. Six months later he was returned, after Michel Barada paid the ransom of two [[pony|ponies]].  His father immediately sent the boy to live with an aunt in St. Louis.  At the age of nine, Antoine returned to the Plains with an Indian hunting party.

As a young man, Antoine Barada married Marcellite Vient, a French woman from St. Louis.  In 1856 they returned to Nebraska to settle on the [[Nemaha Half-Breed Reservation]]; because of his half-Omaha ancestry, Barada was eligible for a land patent from the US government.  He set up a trading post at the reservation, from which the town of [[Barada, Nebraska|Barada]] grew.&lt;ref name="Half-Breed Creek" /&gt;  He and his wife settled {{convert|15|mi|km}} northeast of [[Falls City, Nebraska]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, L.C. (1917) "Antoine Barada", in ''[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~ewilhelm/history.pdf History of Richardson County, Nebraska: Its people, industries and institutions.]'' Indianapolis: B.F. Bowen. p. 190-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myth ==
Barada's myth is widely known in Nebraska.  In ''[[Love Song to the Plains]]'', the early 20th-century [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning writer [[Mari Sandoz]] stated, "'Toine Barada stories were told as far as the upper Yellowstone."&lt;ref name="brown.edu"&gt;(2006) [http://www.brown.edu/Facilities/University_Library/amersem/sandage.pdf "Half-Breed Creek"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Brown University. Retrieved 1/28/08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welsch, R. (1984) ''A Treasury of Nebraska Pioneer Folklore'', Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, p 171.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, [[Louise Pound]] of the [[Federal Writer's Project]] of the [[Works Progress Administration]] collected dozens of stories about Barada, many of which are repeated today.  One tale reported, "He was once matched to wrestle with [[Jean Palos]], a [[Greece|Greek]] wrestling champion... The mighty Palos was notorious for his rough treatment of an opponent.  Antonine won the match by pinching his opponent with his toes while he slapped him into unconsciousness with one blow on his ear."&lt;ref name="brown.edu" /&gt;

Barada was known as a huge man, commonly thought to be almost seven feet tall and widely regarded as a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]].  His strength was well known as well, and he was always asked to assist with [[barn raising]], as he would single-handedly hold heavy beams in place while they were fastened down.  When local farmers needed assistance loading [[Domestic pig|hog]]s for [[Market (place)|market]], they would also call on Barada.  Rather than use a [[loading chute]], Barada simply picked the hogs up and set them in the wagon.  Every time townsfolk needed someone's strength, Barada took the call.&lt;ref&gt;Boye, A. (1993) ''The Complete Roadside Guide to Nebraska.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 Barada was in St. Louis when he was challenged to prove his strength.  He lifted a stone weighing 1,700 pounds, after which point the date of the feat and the weight were inscribed on the stone for future generations.  The stone is purported to still stand there. Barada was also widely regarded for his [[marksmanship]].  Lore recorded his ability to shoot [[prairie chicken]]s on the fly from horseback, as well as the ability to shoot two [[quail]] from every covey.  He was known as a fair hunter, one who never shot a bird on the ground.

One tale of Barada recounted that while working with a lazy railroad crew in Nebraska, Barada became upset.  He grabbed the drop hammer and threw it across the [[Missouri River]], at which point the earth where the hammer fell buckled.  The hammer fall created Nebraska's Missouri River breaks.  Barada was still angry and slammed his fist down on a [[Deep foundation|pile]].  It was driven so far into the soil that it pierced a [[water table]].  Legend says that all of Nebraska would have flooded from this [[bung hole]] if Antoine Barada hadn't plugged it by sitting over it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkstreams.net/context,270 "Transcription: Working script by filmmaker Maria Brooks"], FolkStreams. Retrieved 1/28/08.&lt;/ref&gt; Antonine was also purportedly involved in the Underground Railroad.  Known as the "Lifeguard of the Missouri", Barada supposedly saved many slaves from drowning by personally carrying them across the Missouri River from the state of [[Missouri]] into Nebraska.&lt;ref name="Half-Breed Creek" /&gt;

== Half-Breed Tract ==
Barada received a patent on {{convert|320|acre|km2}} of land in 1856&lt;ref name="Barada"&gt;[http://casde.unl.edu/history/counties/richardson/barada/ "Barada"], University of Nebraska. Retrieved 1/28/08.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Nemaha Half-Breed Reservation]]. The town of [[Barada, Nebraska|Barada]] was established in that tract soon after Barada's claim. Barada ran a fur-trading post there for at least 20 years, during which time the town grew around him.&lt;ref name="Barada" /&gt;

==Death==
Barada died in 1885 and is buried alongside his wife in the Catholic cemetery just east of Barada, the village that bears his name.

In 1951 several of Barada's descendants were members of a [[lawsuit]] brought against the [[Government of the United States]] for recognition of their descent from a full tribal member of the Omaha nation, and their entitlement to compensation related to land allotments and financial benefits received by tribal members. According to the suit, in the 1870s Barada applied to the tribe for membership based on his maternal ancestry. He was rejected due to discriminatory practices by tribal elders and [[Indian Bureau|Indian agents]]. Unlike many Native American tribes, the Omaha have a [[patrilineal]] system of descent, so may have rejected Barada because of his French-American father.&lt;ref name="TrueLogan"/&gt; They considered children with European/white fathers to be "white" and did not accept them into the tribe unless they were officially adopted.&lt;ref name="TrueLogan"&gt;[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ne/topic/resources/OLLibrary/collections/vol19/v19p064.htm  Melvin Randolph Gilmore, "The True Logan Fontenelle"], ''Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society,'' Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, pp. 64-65, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1951 case, the Indian Claims Commission acknowledged there might have been discrimination by the tribe against certain mixed-blood descendants such as Barada; however, the court dismissed the case on the grounds that the Indian Claims Commission did not have jurisdiction over a group claim of individual members; rather, its responsibilities were to adjudicate claims of tribes against the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v01/iccv01p683.pdf "Josephine Mitchell, et al., on relation to ''Omaha tribe of Indians of Nebraska vs. United States Government''."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119153230/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/icc/v01/iccv01p683.pdf |date=November 19, 2008 }} Oklahoma State University. Retrieved 1/28/08.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal government has continued to defer to the federally recognized tribes' sovereignty to determine their own rules for membership and eligibility for voting and benefits.

'''''Arakaki v. State of Hawai'i''''', 314 [[Federal Reporter|F.3d]] 1091 (9th Cir. 2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Arakaki v. State of Hawai'i |vol=314 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1091 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2002 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/314/1091/531764/ |accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a lawsuit challenging the requirement that candidates for election to the [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] board of trustees be [[Native Hawaiians]].

In 2000, after being barred from applying for nomination papers in June because he was not of Hawaiian ancestry, Kenneth R. Conklin was one of 13 plaintiffs in a controversial lawsuit ''Arakaki v. State of Hawai'i'' challenging the requirement that candidates for election to the [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] board of trustees be Hawaiian. The suit, argued by attorneys [[H. William Burgess]] and co-counsel Patrick W. Hanifin, claimed the restriction violated the equal protection clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]], and the [[Voting Rights Act]]. In August, U.S. District Judge [[Helen Gillmor]] issued a judgment allowing non-Hawaiians to run for OHA trustee. Conklin then ran unsuccessfully for OHA trustee in November 2000, placing 4th out of 20 candidates for one "at large" seat. (The winner, Haunani Apoliona, took 58,264 votes or 15.7%, and Conklin took 18,115 votes or 4.9% - there were also 117,597 blank votes or 31.7%)

Lauer started the blog ''Bacon Unwrapped'' and a [[Social networking service|social networking]] site about bacon in 2005, after the idea came to her while she was out drinking with her two brothers; her online success inspired her to write the book, which describes [[curing (food preservation)|curing]] and cooking bacon, gives over 20 bacon recipes, and analyzes the impact of bacon on [[popular culture]]. The text is interspersed with facts about bacon and bacon-related quips from comedian [[Jim Gaffigan]].

==Background==
Before the book's publication, Heather Lauer was a public affairs consultant in [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name="abraham"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Abraham  | first =Lisa  | title =Bacon comes home&amp;nbsp;– Old favorite tastes even better when you do the curing yourself  | work =[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|location=[[Akron, Ohio]]  | page =D1  | date =August 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She hatched the idea to write a book about bacon after going out for cocktails with her two brothers in 2005.&lt;ref name="abraham" /&gt;  Lauer explained to ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'': "I was out drinking with my brothers one night, and the topic of bacon came up. We had eaten bacon as kids, and bacon was a special thing on Sunday mornings. Somehow, the idea came up about how funny it would be to start a blog about bacon&amp;nbsp;... I took it and ran with it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Cordova  | first =Randy  | title =Phoenix bacon blogger publishes book  | work =[[The Arizona Republic]]|location=[[Phoenix, Arizona]]  | publisher =www.azcentral.com  | date =June 9, 2009  | url =http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/2009/06/09/20090609baconlady0609.html | accessdate = 2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She began the blog ''Bacon Unwrapped'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last =Fraser  | first =Garnet   | title =Why the zeitgeist suddenly smells so wonderful  | work =[[Toronto Star]]  | publisher =Toronto Star Newspapers Limited  | page =E12 | date =February 15, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/587604|accessdate=2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at www.baconunwrapped.com,&lt;ref name="pierleoni"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Pierleoni  | first =Allen   | title =You know Dad loves to read&amp;nbsp;– Father's Day gift book ideas run the gamut: Pictures, essays, humor, food&amp;nbsp;– and even some useful stuff   | work =[[The Sacramento Bee]]  | page =D3  | date =May 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="forrest" /&gt; and a [[Social networking service|social networking]] site about bacon at baconnation.ning.com in 2005.&lt;ref name="abraham" /&gt;

Lauer thought that the surge in interest in bacon products prior to the book's publication was "media driven".&lt;ref name="spartos"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Spartos  | first =Carlos  | title =Bacon whoopee!&amp;nbsp;– NYC hog wild for cured meat; Taken with bacon&amp;nbsp;– Have pork product, will travel  | work =[[New York Post]]  | page =041  | date =March 25, 2009 |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/lifestyle/food/item_SkjRdKXPqWVpbnweOHhgWL|accessdate=2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that a response to [[political correctness]] as related to cooking and food consumption may have driven interest in the product.&lt;ref name="spartos" /&gt; Lauer said that bacon seems to be "the one thing that people are unwilling to give up".&lt;ref name="spartos" /&gt; In a post of her blog in March 2009, Lauer lamented those that were willing to posit an end to the trend of interest in bacon.&lt;ref name="spartos" /&gt; She commented, "Bacon is something that everybody is familiar with and most people grew up eating. It has a comfort aspect to it and a familiarity. It's also got an addictive aspect to it&amp;nbsp;— that sweet and salty combination of flavors."&lt;ref name="abraham" /&gt; She asserted that interest in the product is as much due to the culture surrounding it as to bacon itself.&lt;ref name="abraham" /&gt; "Current food trends focus on eating real and eating local, and there's nothing more real than a delicious strip of bacon. In many U.S. cities, local producers and chefs are making a name for themselves because of bacon," said Lauer.&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Asa  | first =Rick  | title =All hail bacon  | work =[[Chicago Tribune]]|location=[[Chicago]], Illinois  | publisher =Chicago Tribune Company  | page =6; Section: Good Eating  | date =October 28, 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt; She stated that "most chefs would admit that bacon has long been one of their secret weapons in the kitchen."&lt;ref name="asa" /&gt; The book was marketed as the "most comprehensive book about bacon to date".&lt;ref name="spartos" /&gt; Lauer promoted her book in a September 2009 appearance as a co-host at the Blue Ribbon Bacon Tour in [[Pennsylvania]], hosted by fellow bacon blogger Jason Mosley (Mr. Baconpants, at mrbaconpants.com).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =Batz Jr. | first =Bob  | title =Bacon Tour your chance to pig out | work =[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|location=[[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania | page =E-1 | date =September 24, 2009|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09267/1000308-34.stm|accessdate=2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Writing for ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'', Allen Pierleoni recommended the book as a gift for [[Father's Day]], and called the work "entertaining and informational, full of anecdotes, history, recipes and explanations of what pork belly has brought to the popular culture".&lt;ref name="pierleoni" /&gt; Rita Zekas of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' also recommended the book as a Father's Day gift.&lt;ref name="zekas"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Zekas  | first =Rita  | title =Great gifts for dad  | work =[[Toronto Star]]  | publisher =www.thestar.com  | date =June 19, 2009  | url =https://www.thestar.com/printArticle/652472 | accessdate = 2009-12-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerry J. Byrne noted that the book covers "everything from bacon-curing methods to bacon blogs" and includes "easy recipes".&lt;ref name="byrne" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed called the book a "voluminous look at all things bacon";&lt;ref name="publishers"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Publishers Weekly staff  | title =Bacon: A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat  | work =[[Publishers Weekly]]  | publisher =Reed Elsevier Inc. | page =Lifestyle  | date =May 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the review concluded, "Readers who, like Lauer, possess a borderline-obsessive love for bacon are likely to embrace this as their new Bible, but anyone else will quickly get their fill."&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt; Rachel Forrest of ''[[The Portsmouth Herald]]'' recommended the book in her "Annual Summer Reading List for [[Foodie]]s".&lt;ref name="forrest"&gt;{{cite news   | last =Forrest  | first =Rachel  | title =Annual Summer Reading List for Foodies  | work =[[The Portsmouth Herald]]  | publisher =www.seacoastonline.com  | date =June 3, 2009  | url =http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20090603-LIFE-906030304 | accessdate =  2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Another of my favorites this year is 'Bacon: A Love Story: A Salty Survey of Everybody's Favorite Meat' by Heather Lauer. A book all about bacon&amp;nbsp;... she profiles chefs that use it, odd finds across the nation and plenty of recipes," commented Forrest.&lt;ref name="forrest" /&gt; ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' highlighted the book among its selection of "Books to help turn pages of summer".&lt;ref name="turnpages"&gt;{{cite news  | last =The Arizona Republic staff | title =Books to help turn pages of summer | work =[[The Arizona Republic]] | publisher =www.azcentral.com | page =Non-fiction | date =May 5, 2009 | url =http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/ae/articles/2009/05/05/20090505summerbooks0503thrillers.html | accessdate =2009-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í World News Service reports a [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] membership of more than 5 million worldwide, in "virtually every country" and many territories.{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|2017}} Other sources such as [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] or the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]] have listed Bahá'í membership as over 7 million.{{sfn|Britannica|2010}}{{sfn|World Christian Encyclopedia|2001}} The Bahá'í Faith is recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity,{{sfn|Britannica|2002}}{{sfn|MacEoin|2000}} and the only religion to have grown faster than the population of the world in all major areas over the last century.{{sfn|Johnson|Grim|2013}}

Membership data on a relatively new, worldwide religion are difficult to arrive at. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organised community, but the Bahá'í population is spread out and not in a majority anywhere.{{sfn|Major Religions of the World|2000}} Populations are not assigned a Bahá'í religious adherence by birth, as is the case with other major religions such as Islam and Christianity.{{sfn|Major Religions of the World|2000}} Few religious surveys include the Bahá'í Faith due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error, and those that have included the Bahá'í Faith are known to underestimate or overinflate many proportionally small groups.{{sfn|NSRI Methodology|1990}}{{sfn|Donaldson|2017}} Additionally, Bahá'í membership data does not break out active participation from the total number of people who have expressed their belief.

The official claim of "more than five million Bahá’ís" in the world came originally in 1991{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|1992}} and hasn't changed since.{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|2017}} The official agencies of the religion have focused on publishing more concrete data, such as numbers of local and national [[Spiritual Assembly|spiritual assemblies]], countries and territories represented, languages and tribes represented, and publishing trusts.{{sfn|BWC Stats|2001}}{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|2017}}

==Definition of membership==
In the 1930s the Bahá'ís of the United States and Canada began requiring new adherents to sign a declaration of faith, stating their belief in Bahá'u'lláh, the Báb, and `Abdu'l-Bahá, and an understanding that there are laws and institutions to obey. The original purpose of signing a declaration card was to allow followers to apply for lawful exemption from active military service.{{sfn|Effendi|1971|p=140}} The signature of a card later became optional in Canada, but in the US is still used for records and administrative requirements.{{sfn|Hornby|1983|p=76}} Many countries follow the pattern of the US and Canada.

Other than signing a card and being acknowledged by a [[Spiritual Assembly]], there is no initiation or requirement of attendance to remain on the official roll sheets. Members receive regular mailings unless they request not to be contacted.

==Difficulties in enumeration==
The fact that the religion is diffuse and proportionally small are major barriers to demographic research by outsiders. Even in the United States, where significant resources are dedicated to gathering data, the Bahá'í Faith is often left off of religious surveys due to the high sample size required to reduce the margin of error. In some countries the Bahá'í Faith is illegal and Bahá'ís endure some degree of [[persecution of Bahá'ís|persecution]], making it difficult for even Bahá'ís to maintain a count.

Adherents.com, a website dedicated to collecting statistics on world religions, made the following comments about Bahá'í membership:
{{quote|As with most religious groups, organizationally reported adherent counts include significant numbers of nominal members, or people who no longer actively participate, yet still identify themselves as adherents. There are valid arguments that some of the "mass conversions" have resulted in adherents with little or no acculturation into the new religious system. As is typical with a religious group made up primarily of converts, Baha'is who drift from active participation in the movement are less likely to retain nominal identification with the religion -- because it was not the religion of their parents or the majority religion of the surrounding culture. On the other hand, there are no countries in which people are automatically assigned to the Baha'i Faith at birth (as is the case with Islam, Christianity, Shinto, Buddhism, and other faiths), so their numbers aren't inflated with people who have never willingly participated in or been influenced by the religion while adults.

On balance, while official Baha'i figures are not a measure of active participants, the proportion of participating adherents among claimed adherents is thought to be higher than average among the "major religions" on this list. The Baha'i community is remarkably active and influential in religious matters on both global and local levels, especially given their relatively small numbers compared to some other religions.{{sfn|Major Religions of the World|2000}}}}

Most denominations make no effort at all to maintain a national membership database and must rely on local churches or surveys of the general population. Local church membership rolls are often maintained poorly because there may be no need for an official membership list (Bahá'ís at least must maintain accurate voting lists) and local congregations sometimes do not provide their denomination's membership data even when asked.

===Bahá’í sources===
====Recent====
*As early as 1991 official estimates were of "more than five million Bahá’ís",{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|1992}} which is still in use as of 2017.{{sfn|Bahá'í World News Service|2017}}
*The Department of Statistics, [[Bahá'í World Centre]], does not provide an estimated total, but publishes more concrete statistics, such as the representation among countries, languages, and tribes. In 2001 the department claimed there were 11,740 local Spiritual Assemblies, and 127,381 localities in 236 countries and territories.{{sfn|BWC Stats|2001}} 
*A 1997 statement by the NSA of South Africa wrote: "…the Bahá'í Faith enjoys a world-wide following in excess of six million people."{{sfn|NSA South Africa|1997}}
*In 1989 the journal ''Religion'' published an article by Bahá'ís [[Moojan Momen]] and [[Peter Smith (historian)|Peter Smith]].{{sfn|Momen|Smith|1989}} They observed that in the 1950s there were "probably in the region of 200,000 Bahá'ís world-wide. The vast majority of these (over 90%) lived in Iran." And by the end of the 1960s, "we 'guestimate' that there may now have been about one million Bahá'ís."
*A 1987 report, published in the United States ''Bahá'í News'' reports 4.74 million Bahá'ís in 1986 growing at a rate of 31% over 1979, or 4.4% per year on average.{{sfn|Bahá'í News|1987}}

====Early====
*The first known survey of the religion comes from an unpublished work in 1919–1920 gathered by [[John Esslemont]] and had been intended to be part of his well-known [[Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era]].{{sfn|Momen|2004|pp=63-106}} In it, consulting various individuals, he summarizes the religion's presence in Egypt, Germany, India, Iran, Iraq, Turkestan, and the United States. It did not arrive at a total but did have some regional statistics based on some individual reports. 
*During his [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|`Abdu'l-Bahá's tour of America]] several newspapers made claims of how large the religion was - usually the millions of people. 
**In 1912, a reporter in Salt Lake City claimed [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] said the religion had "10,000,000 followers in the world."{{sfn|Evening Standard|1912}}
**On June 16, 1912, a news report introduced him as the "Persian religious leader and spiritual and temporal head of the 14,000,000 of Bahá’ís scattered throughout the world."{{sfn|Anaconda Standard|1912}}
**On April 24, 1912, a newspaper article said "Bahá’ísm now has 15,000,000 adherents scattered throughout the world, several hundred thousand of whom are in the United States and Canada."{{sfn|Houston Chronicle|1912}}
**On April 12, 1912, a newspaper introduced him as "head of one of the newest and most thriving religions in the world, numbering 20,000,000 souls among his followers, of whom several hundred souls are in New York."{{sfn|Greeley-Smith|1912}}
**On September 9, 1911, a news report about ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's visit to London claimed "at a moderate estimate, three million followers."{{sfn|Boston Evening Transcript|1911}}

===Other sources===
Many sources mentioning the number of Bahá'ís in the world are deriving their information from just a few sources, which themselves review Bahá'í sources among many censuses and surveys. When a number is estimated for a particular year, future years are estimated based on growth rates.
*'''The World Christian Database''' (WCD), and its predecessor the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]. The WCD reviewed religious populations around the world and released results of their investigations at various times, most recently in 2010. The Bahá'í Faith has consistently placed high in the statistics of growth over these various releases of data.{{sfn|World Christian Encyclopedia|2001}}{{sfn|Foreign-Policy|2007}}{{sfn|Grim|2012}} A review examining the reliability and bias of the World Christian Database found it "highly correlated with other sources of data" but "consistently gave a higher estimate for percent Christian." In conclusion they found that, "Religious composition estimates in the World Christian Database are generally plausible and consistent with other data sets."{{sfn|Hsu|Reynolds|Hackett|Gibbon|2008}}
*'''Association for Religious Data Archives''' (ARDA). The archive is "a collection of surveys, polls, and other data submitted by the foremost scholars and research centers in the world." It gathers data from, "the US Census Bureau's International Data Base, the US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report, the United Nations Human Development Reports, and others."{{sfn|ARDA|2010}}

In 2012 the [[Pew Research Center]] published a report on the Global Religious Landscape. Bahá'ís were grouped in with the category "Other Religions" that included Sikhs and Zoroastrians. Pew said, "Because of the lack of data on these faiths in many countries, the Pew Forum has not attempted to estimate the size of individual religions within this category..."{{sfn|Pew Research|2012}}

====From 2005 and newer====
* In April 2017, ''[[The Economist]]'' reported that there were more than 7 million Bahá'ís in the world.{{sfn|A.V.|2017}}
* In 2016 the '''Yearbook of International Religious Demography 2016''' noted just over 7.8 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2015, having grown at an overall rate of 2.79% across the century 1910 to 2010.{{sfn|Grim|Johnson|Skirbekk|Zurlo|2016}} The countries with the largest Bahá'í populations in 2015 were, (starting with the largest): India, the US, Kenya, Viet Nam, Congo DR, Philippines, Zambia, South Africa, Iran and Bolivia, ranging upwards from 232,000 to just over 2 million in India.{{sfn|Populations and Demographic Trends|2011}}
*In 2013 the book ''The World’s Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography'' wrote, "The Baha'i Faith is the only religion to have grown faster in every United Nations region over the past 100 years than the general population; Baha’i was thus the fastest-growing religion between 1910 and 2010, growing at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region."{{sfn|Johnson|Grim|2013}}
*The 2010, [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimate is of 7.3 million (based partly on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]).{{sfn|ARDA|2010}}
*In 2010, The World Religion Database states there are 7.3 million Bahá'ís.{{sfn|Grim|2012}}
*In 2010, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] estimated a total of 7.3 million Bahá’ís residing in 221 countries,{{sfn|Britannica|2010}}  based partly on the World Christian Encyclopedia.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*[[The World Factbook]] states that Bahá'ís make up 0.12% of the world based on a 2007 estimate,{{sfn|CIA World Factbook|2007}} corresponding to 7.9 million people.
*The 2005 [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimate is of 7.6 million{{sfn|ARDA|2005}} which is also echoed elsewhere.{{sfn|Warf|Vincent|2007}}
*In 2005, the ''Encyclopedia of Religion, second edition'', records that:
:"In the early twenty-first century the Bahá’ís number close to six million in more than two hundred countries. The number of adherents rose significantly in the late twentieth century from a little more than one million at the end of the 1960s."{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=739}}

====from 2000 to 2004====
*In 2004, the ''Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa'' vol 1, reported that "By 1900, the community… had reached 50,000-100,000… Bahá’ís worldwide [are] estimated in 2001 at 5 million."
*In 2003, ''World Book Encyclopedia'' reported that "there are about 5,500,000 Bahá’ís worldwide."{{sfn|World Book|2003}} 
*In 2001,''World Christian Encyclopedia'', 2001,[http://www.bible.ca/global-religion-statistics-world-christian-encyclopedia.htm p 4] estimated 7.1 million Bahá'ís in the world in 2000, representing 218 countries. The same source estimated 5.7 million in 1990.{{sfn|Adherent Statistic Citations|2007}} Its definition of membership is broader than the official Bahá'í definition and would include people who attend Bahá'í gatherings regularly even if they have not declared their faith or persons who state they are Bahá'ís in government censuses as a result of reading about the religion or hearing about it on the radio.
*In 2000, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] estimated a total of 7.1 million Bahá’ís residing in 218 countries,{{sfn|Britannica|2000}}  based partly on the World Christian Encyclopedia.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
*In 2000, [[Denis MacEoin]] wrote in the ''Handbook of Living Religions'' that:
:"the movement has had remarkable success in establishing itself as a vigorous contender in the mission fields of Africa, India, parts of South America, and the Pacific, thus outstripping other new religions in a world-wide membership of perhaps 4 million and an international spread recently described as second only to that of Christianity. The place of Baha'ism among world religions now seems assured."
*Adherents.com estimates 7 million Bahá’ís in 2000 based on Bahá'í sources, research from the ''World Christian Encyclopedia, 2000'', and the Population Reference Bureau.{{sfn|Largest Baha'i Communities|2001}}{{sfn|Major Religions of the World|2000}}

====1980s to 2000====
*In 1998, the ''Academic American Encyclopedia'' said that the Bahá’ís "are estimated to number about 2 million."
*In 1997, ''Dictionary of World Religions'' estimated "five million Bahá’ís" in the world.{{sfn|Bowker|1997}}
*In 1997, ''Religions of the World'' published: "today there are about 5 million" Bahá’ís.
*In 1993, the [[Columbia Encyclopedia]] published: "There are about 5 million Bahá’ís in the world."
*In 1995 the [[HarperCollins]] ''Dictionary of Religion'' states: "In 1985, it was estimated that there were between 1.5 to 2 million Baha'is, with the greatest areas of recent growth in Africa, India, and Vietnam."

====1950s-1980s====
*Paul Oliver wrote in ''World Faiths'' that there were "approximately five million Bahá’ís" in 1963.{{sfn|Oliver|2001}}

==Figures from various countries==
{{see also|Category:Bahá'í Faith by country|Bahá'í Faith by continent}}
From the early 1960s until the late 1990s, the Baha'i population of the [[United States]] went from around 10,000 to 140,000 on official rolls, but the members with known addresses in 1998 was about half.{{sfn|Stockman|1998}} In recent years, the United States Bahá'í community has been releasing detailed membership statistics.{{sfn|Jones|2002}}{{sfn|Gaustadd|Barlow|2001|pp=279-81 }}

Bahá'ís and other sources such as official government census data or other some third party organizations can vary. Sometimes the Bahá'í sourced numbers are higher and sometimes lower. And census data is sometimes criticized, as in the case of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2012/04/06/nagaland-s-demographic-somersault-how-reliable-are-india-s-official-statistics/ How reliable are India’s official statistics?], by Ankush Agrawal, IEG, and Vikas Kumar, EastAsiaForum.org, 6 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Srinivasan|Bedi|2008|ps=: "The civil registration system... is not complete and far from reliable."}}

'''CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;''' (originally called '''CiteSeer''') is a public [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] and [[digital library]] for scientific and academic papers, primarily in the fields of [[computer science|computer]] and [[information science]]. CiteSeer holds a United States patent # 6289342, titled "''Autonomous citation indexing and literature browsing using citation context''," granted on September 11, 2001. Stephen R. Lawrence, C. Lee Giles, Kurt D. Bollacker are the inventors of this patent assigned to NEC Laboratories America, Inc. This patent was filed on May 20, 1998, which has its roots (Priority) to January 5, 1998. A continuation patent was also granted to the same inventors and also assigned to NEC Labs on this invention i.e. US Patent # 6738780 granted on May 18, 2004 and was filed on May 16, 2001. CiteSeer is considered as a predecessor of academic search tools such as [[Google Scholar]] and [[Microsoft Academic Search]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} CiteSeer-like engines and archives usually only harvest documents from publicly available websites and do not crawl publisher websites. For this reason, authors whose documents are freely available are more likely to be represented in the index.

CiteSeer's goal is to improve the dissemination and access of academic and scientific literature. As a non-profit service that can be freely used by anyone, it has been considered as part of the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement that is attempting to change [[academic publishing|academic and scientific publishing]] to allow greater access to scientific literature. CiteSeer freely provided [[Open Archives Initiative]] [[metadata]] of all indexed documents and links indexed documents when possible to other sources of metadata such as [[DBLP]] and the [[ACM Portal]]. To promote [[open data]], '''CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;''' shares its data for non-commercial purposes under a Creative Commons license.&lt;ref name=CC-license&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/about/data|title = CiteSeerX Data Policy|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-10|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name can be construed to have at least two explanations. As a pun, a 'sightseer' is a tourist who looks at the sights, so a 'cite seer' would be a researcher who looks at cited papers. Another is a 'seer' is a prophet and a 'cite seer' is a prophet of citations. CiteSeer changed its name to ResearchIndex at one point and then changed it back.

== History ==

=== CiteSeer and CiteSeer.IST ===
CiteSeer was created by researchers [[Lee Giles]], [[Kurt Bollacker]] and [[Steve Lawrence (computer scientist)|Steve Lawrence]] in 1997 while they were at the [[NEC Research Institute]] (now [[NEC Laboratories America|NEC Labs]]), [[Princeton, New Jersey]], USA. CiteSeer's goal was to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the web and use autonomous [[citation index]]ing to permit querying by citation or by document, ranking them by [[citation impact]]. At one point, it was called ResearchIndex.

CiteSeer became public in 1998 and had many new features unavailable in academic search engines at that time. These included:
* Autonomous Citation Indexing automatically created a citation index that can be used for literature search and evaluation.
* Citation statistics and related documents were computed for all articles cited in the database, not just the indexed articles.
* Reference linking allowing browsing of the database using citation links.
* Citation context showed the context of citations to a given paper, allowing a researcher to quickly and easily see what other researchers have to say about an article of interest.
* Related documents were shown using citation and word based measures and an active and continuously updated bibliography is shown for each document.

After NEC, in 2004 it was hosted as CiteSeer.IST on the [[World Wide Web]] at the College of Information Sciences and Technology, The [[Pennsylvania State University]], and had over 700,000 documents. For enhanced access, performance and research, similar versions of CiteSeer were supported at universities such as the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of Zürich]] and the [[National University of Singapore]]. However, these versions of CiteSeer proved difficult to maintain and are no longer available. Because CiteSeer only indexes freely available papers on the web and does not have access to publisher metadata, it returns fewer citation counts than sites, such as [[Google Scholar]], that have publisher metadata.  
&lt;!-- for historical reference:
Versions of CiteSeer have been or are available at the following links:
* [http://citeseer.ittc.ku.edu Univ. of Kansas]
* [http://citeseer.csail.mit.edu MIT]
* [http://sherry.ifi.unizh.ch Univ. of Zürich]
* [http://citeseer.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs National Univ. of Singapore]

--&gt;

CiteSeer had not been comprehensively updated since 2005 due to limitations in its architecture design. It had a representative sampling of research documents in computer and information science but was limited in coverage because it was limited to papers that are publicly available, usually at an author's homepage, or those submitted by an author. To overcome some of these limitations, a modular and open source architecture for CiteSeer was designed - CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; ===
'''CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;''' replaced CiteSeer and all queries to CiteSeer were redirected. CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="about-page"&gt;{{Cite web |title=About CiteSeerX |accessdate=2010-05-07 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/about/site}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a public [[search engine]] and [[digital library]] and [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] for scientific and academic papers primarily with a focus on [[computer science|computer]] and [[information science]].&lt;ref name="about-page"/&gt; However, recently CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; has been expanding into other scholarly domains such as economics, physics and others. Released in 2008, it was loosely based on the previous CiteSeer search engine and digital library and is built with a new [[Open-source software|open source]] infrastructure, SeerSuite, and new algorithms and their implementations. It was developed by researchers Dr. Isaac Councill and Dr. C. [[Lee Giles]] at [[Penn State College of Information Sciences and Technology|the College of Information Sciences and Technology]], [[Pennsylvania State University]]. It continues to support the goals outlined by CiteSeer to actively crawl and harvest academic and scientific documents on the public web and to use a citation inquery by citations and ranking of documents by the impact of citations. Currently, Lee Giles, Prasenjit Mitra, Susan Gauch, Min-Yen Kan, Pradeep Teregowda, Juan Pablo Fernández Ramírez, Pucktada Treeratpituk, Jian Wu, Douglas Jordan, Steve Carman, Jack Carroll, Jim Jansen, and Shuyi Zheng are or have been actively involved in its development. Recently, a table search feature was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The CiteSeerX Team |url=http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/about/team |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |df=mdy |accessdate=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], [[NASA]], and [[Microsoft Research]].

CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; continues to be rated as one of the world's top repositories and was rated number 1 in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ranking Web of World Repositories: Top 800 Repositories |publisher=Cybermetrics Lab |date=July 2010 |url=http://repositories.webometrics.info/top800_rep.asp |accessdate=2010-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724004342/http://repositories.webometrics.info/top800_rep.asp |archivedate=2010-07-24 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It currently has over 6 million documents with nearly 6 million unique authors and 120 million citations.

CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; also shares its software, data, databases and metadata with other researchers, currently by [[Amazon S3]] and by [[rsync]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=About CiteSeerX Data |publisher=Pennsylvania State University |accessdate=2012-01-25 |url=http://csxstatic.ist.psu.edu/about/data}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its new modular open source architecture and software (available previously on [[SourceForge]] but now on [[GitHub]]) is built on [[Apache Solr]] and other [[Apache Software Foundation|Apache]] and open source tools which allows it to be a testbed for new algorithms in document harvesting, ranking, indexing, and information extraction.

== Current features ==

=== Automated information extraction ===
CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; uses automated information extraction tools, usually built on machine learning methods such ParsCit, to extract scholarly document metadata such as title, authors, abstract, citations, etc. As such, there are sometime errors in authors and titles. Other academic search engines have similar errors.

=== Focused crawling ===
CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; crawls publicly available scholarly documents primarily from author webpages and other open resources, and does not have access to publisher metadata. As such citation counts in CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; are usually less than those in Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search who have access to publisher metadata.

=== Usage ===
CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; has nearly 1 million users worldwide based on unique IP addresses and has millions of hits daily. Annual downloads of document PDFs was nearly 200 million for 2015.

=== Data ===
CiteSeer&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; data is regularly shared under a [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license]] with researchers worldwide and has been and is used in many experiments and competitions.

== Other SeerSuite-based search engines ==
The CiteSeer model had been extended to cover academic documents in business with [[SmealSearch]] and in e-business with [[eBizSearch]].  However, these were not maintained by their sponsors. An older version of both of these could be once found at [[BizSeer.IST]] but is no longer in service.

Other Seer-like search and repository systems have been built for chemistry, [[ChemXSeer|Chem&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;Seer]] and for archaeology, ArchSeer. Another had been built for robots.txt file search, [[BotSeer]]. All of these are built on the open source tool [[SeerSuite]], which uses the open source indexer [[Lucene]].

In June 2013, Stan and Prodan were travelling in a car on the [[A2 motorway (Romania)|Autostrada Soarelui]] (Sun Motorway) between [[Constanța]] and [[Valu lui Traian]]. They were stopped by police officers who found them fighting and Stan was taken to hospital. The singer later appeared on national television with evidence of assault visible on her face, generating media attention in Romania. Observers were generally on Stan's side.

According to the singer, the incident occurred after she asked Prodan for her earnings; he reacted violently and asaulted her. Prodan said he had acted in self-defence after Stan hit him in his car and threatened to commit suicide. After several hearings with magistrates, Prodan received a seven-month suspended sentence for "the crime of battery or other violence" and was assessed damages. The court ruled Stan's other accusations were groundless and she was fined court costs, although Prodan's fines were later increased. This decision was handed down by the court on 21 December 2016.

In 2009, [[Alexandra Stan]] was discovered at a karaoke bar by Romanian producers and songwriters Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi, who offered her a record deal with their label Maan Records. That year she recorded a promotional single, "Show Me The Way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban.ro/muzica/o-noua-voce-alexandra-stan/|title=O noua voce: Alexandra Stan|publisher=Urban.ro|language=Romanian|accessdate=16 October 2015|date=25 November 2009|trans-title=A new singer: Alexandra Stan|archivedate=17 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017144619/http://www.urban.ro/muzica/o-noua-voce-alexandra-stan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Stan's single "[[Mr. Saxobeat]]" topped the [[Romanian Top 100]] chart for eight consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/alexandra-stan-mn0002651146/biography|title=AllMusic: Alexandra Stan | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was also commercially successful abroad, topping record charts in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Slovakia, Switzerland and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Alexandra+Stan&amp;titel=Mr.+Saxobeat&amp;cat=s|title=Austriancharts.at – Alexandra Stan – Mr. Saxobeat | publisher=[[Ö3 Austria Top 40]] | language=German|accessdate=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://zene.slagerlistak.hu/radios-top-40-jatszasi-lista/2011/24|title=Archívum – Slágerlisták – MAHASZ | publisher=[[MAHASZ|Rádiós Top 40 játszási lista]].

The parties were identified as Stan and Prodan; Stan had visible evidence of physical assault (facial bruises), prompting the police to suggest she be taken to hospital and possibly file a complaint against her assailant. Stan was taken to Spitalul Clinic Judeţean de Urgenţă Constanţa (Constanța County Emergency Hospital), where she was treated and released.&lt;ref name="mediafax"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediafax.ro/life-inedit/alexandra-stan-desfigurata-dupa-ce-ar-fi-fost-batuta-de-manager-foto-10977576|title=Alexandra Stan, desfigurată după ce ar fi fost bătută de manager|trans-title=Alexandra Stan, disfigured after her alleged fight with her manager|date=17 June 2013|publisher=Mediafax|author=Legănel, Cătălin|accessdate=1 January 2017|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, judges from Constanța decided not to prosecute Prodan for Stan's complaint due to a lack of physical evidence;&lt;ref name="romania tv"/&gt; however, in June 2015 a preliminary hearing with magistrates was held. Prodan testified that he and Stan had "more than a professional relationship", which he planned to end. According to him, the incident began when he told Stan in his recording studio that she had sung poorly. Prodan alleged that Stan did not want to leave and he stated that he pushed her towards the exit. Prodan also stated that Stan slipped on a wet floor while trying to hit him. When describing the events in his car, Prodan said Stan began kicking him; he defended himself, slapping her when she jerked the steering wheel to the right. Prodan testified that Stan cried, said she wanted to commit suicide and opened the door to jump out of the car; he grabbed her hand and stopped. Stan, weeping during the hearing, said Prodan threw her into his car and struck her multiple times during the trip; in shock, she jerked the wheel to get out of the car. She denied their relationship extended beyond business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In another hearing in late December 2015, Stan attended with her new boyfriend; during that hearing, the singer demanded more than €1 million in damages from Prodan. Prodan's ex-wife and Nicolae Nemirschi, the father of Prodan's songwriting and producing collaborator, Andrei Nemirschi, were also present, and they testified that the singer had an affair with Prodan, which Stan denied. Prodan's ex-wife said that their marriage ended after she placed a recording device in Prodan's car which provided evidence of his romantic relationship with Stan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://stirileprotv.ro/stiri/actualitate/alexandra-stan-ii-cere-daune-de-un-milion-de-euro-fostului-manager-marcel-prodan-ce-a-declarat-cantareata-in-fata-instantei.html|title=Alexandra Stan ii cere daune de un milion de euro fostului manager, Marcel Prodan|trans-title=Alexandra Stan demands damage exceeding one million euros from past-manager Marcel Prodan|publisher=''[[Pro TV|Știrile Pro TV]]''|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=3 December 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 February 2016, Prodan received a seven-month [[suspended sentence]] for "the crime of battery or other violence" and was ordered to pay Stan €193 for medical care and €10,000 in damages.&lt;ref name="click2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.click.ro/vedete/romanesti/impresarul-alexandrei-stan-7-luni-de-inchisoare-cu-suspendare|title=

Romanian commentator Mircea Toma said, "The [Romanian] media treat this subject in a derisory way.

'''Djedi''' (also '''Dedi'''&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; or '''Djedi of Djed-Sneferu'''&lt;ref&gt;„Djed-Sneferu“ was the curatorial name of [[Dahshur]] during the Old Kingdom. See: Jean Claude Goyon, Christine Cardin: ''Proceedings of the ninth International Congress of Egyptologists'', volume 1. page 1128.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the name of a [[fictional]] [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[magician (paranormal)|magician]] appearing in the fourth chapter of a story told in the legendary ''[[Westcar Papyrus]].'' He is said to have worked [[miracle|wonders]] during the reign of king ([[pharaoh]]) [[Khufu]] ([[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]]).

==Literary person==
Djedi appears only in the fourth story of the ''Westcar Papyrus'' - there is no [[Archeology|archeological]] or [[History|historical]] evidence that he existed. Nevertheless he is an object of great interest for [[historian]]s and [[Egyptologist]]s, since his magic tricks are connected to later [[culture|cultural]] perceptions of the personality of king Khufu. Djedi is described as a [[commoner]] of extraordinary age, endowed with magical powers and talented in making [[prophecy|prophecies]].&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd: ''Herodotus, book II: introduction'', Band 1. BRILL, Leiden 1975, {{ISBN|90-04-04179-6}}, page 104 – 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The wonder of Djedi==
According to the ''Westcar Papyrus,'' prince [[Djedefhor]] brings up the story of Djedi. He stands before his father, king Khufu, and says: “There is only speaking of miracles which happened a long time ago, something known by past generations only. Truth and falsehood cannot be distinguished here. But there is someone under thy majesty´s own lifetime who is not known, someone who is able to make a ignoramus become wise.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu asks: “What's the meaning of this, Djedefhor, my son?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedefhor answers: “There's a commoner named ''Djedi'', living in Djed-Sneferu. He's a simple citizen, but 110 years old, eats 500 loaves of bread, a shoulder of [[beef]] and drinks 100 jars of [[beer]] every day. He is capable of resurrecting [[decapitation|decapitated]] beings. He is also said to be able to make wild [[lion]]s so obedient that the animal would follow him with a cord dragging on the ground. Furthermore, this Djedi has knowledge of the number of ''Iput''&lt;ref&gt;A word of unsure meaning which may be translated as "sealed chamber" or "sanctuary"; Egyptologists dispute the real meaning. See: Jenny Berggren: ''The Ipwt in Papyrus Westcar''. Master's Thesis, Uppsala 2006 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070609172438/http://www.arkeologi.uu.se/egy/education/uppsatser/Berggren-Ipwt.pdf PDF; 2,57&amp;nbsp;MB])&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''wenet''-[[sanctuary]] of [[Thoth]].”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The pharaoh spent a good deal of time to seek for these chambers, for he planned to build something similar to his horizon.&lt;ref&gt;In this case “horizon” is a quaint alteration for a royal [[cemetery]]. See: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 42 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; And Khufu orders: “You thyself, Djedefhor, my son, may bring him to me!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;

And so Djedefhor arranges his journey during the first month of the ''schemu''-season&lt;ref&gt;Egyptian word for [[spring (season)|spring]]. See Rolf Krauss: ''Sothis- und Monddaten: Studien zur astronomischen und technischen Chronologie Altägyptens'', Gerstenberg, Hildesheim 1985, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|3-8067-8086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travels to Djed-Sneferu. He finds Djedi and invites the old man to the king's palace with the words: “Your condition is equal to someone who lives from aging and to someone who sleeps until dawn, free of illness and wheezing. For ‘aging’ is the time of dying, the time of the preparing the burial and the time of being buried. This is the questioning about the condition of a noble man. I have come to summon you in order of my father, justified, that you may eat from the delicacies my father gives, the food of his followers. And then he may guide you to the ancestors which are in the necropolis now.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi replies: “Welcome, welcome, Djedefhor, son of the king, beloved of his father! May you be praised by your father, Khufu the justified. May he let your place be at the front of all time-honored ones. May thine ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)|Ka]]'' successfully champion all things against any enemy. May thine ''[[Ba (Egyptian soul)|Ba]]'' know the ways that lead to the gateway of the mummified deceased.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedefhor brings Djedi to the harbor and makes a boat prepared for traveling. The old man promises to follow Djedefhor, on the condition that he may bring his books and scholars with him. Djedefhor accepts, and both men travel to Khufu's royal palace.

Djedefhor enters the palace and goes immediately to his father, king Khufu. The prince says: “May thy majesty live, be blessed and being prosperous! I have brought Djedi to you!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu replies: “Go and bring him to me!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Then Khufu takes place in the royal audience-hall. The Pharaoh receives Djedi with the words: “What is it, Djedi, this denying to have seen you ever before?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi answers: “Oh sovereign, my lord! Only the one who is summoned is one who will come. I was summoned, and now see, oh sovereign, my lord, I have come.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The pharaoh continues: “Is it true, this talk-about that you could mend a severed head?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi says: “Yes, oh sovereign, my lord. May you live, be blessed and prosperous. I know how to do that.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu replies: “May a prisoner, who is jailed, be brought to me, so that his [[execution]] may be enforced.”.&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi refuses with the words: “Not to make a human suffer, oh sovereign, my lord! May you live, be blessed and prosperous. You see, it was never allowed to do something like that on the noble flock.”&lt;ref&gt;It's assumed by Egyptologists, that the alteration “noble flock” was a bad pun to the human race in general. See: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 42 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Djedi chooses three animals instead - first a [[goose]]. He decapitates the goose and places her head at the eastern side of the audience hall, the body at the western side. Then Djedi utters a secret spell and the head of the goose stands up, starting to waddle. Then the body of the goose stands up and waddles, too. Both body-parts move into equal directions, then melt together. The resurrected goose now leaves the hall cackling. The same performance is done with an undefined water bird&lt;ref&gt;The bird in question is called ''khet-aa-bird'' which means “the bird with long, wooden legs”. It is highly uncertain which race of bird was meant in the papyrus. Verena Lepper thinks about a [[Eurasian bittern]], which is mentioned in offering lists of the Old Kingdom. See: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 115.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[bull]]. Both animals are brought successfully back to life, too. Now the king says: “It is said that you know the number of ''Iput'' inside the ''wenet''-sanctuary of Thoth. Now?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi replies: “May you be praised, oh sovereign, my lord! I don't know their number. But I know where they can be found.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu asks: “Where is it?” Djedi answers: “There is a box of scrolls, made of [[flint]], which is stored in a room called ‘archive’ at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The king orders: “Take that box!”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi replies: “May your highness be prosperous and blessed, I'm not the one who can bring it to you.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu asks: “Who may be the one who could bring it to me?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi answers: “The eldest of the three children in the womb of ''[[Rededjet]]'', he will bring it to you.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The king says: “I really wish all these things you say. Who is it, this ''Rededjet''?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi replies: “It's the wife of a ''wab''-priest of the god [[Ra]], lord of [[Sachebu]]. The god has adumbrated, that the eldest of the three shall worship as a high priest of Heliopolis over the whole realm.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; The king's mood becomes grim after this. Djedi asks: “What is that heart of thine, oh sovereign, my lord, becoming so sad! Is it because of the children I have adumbrated? First your son, then his son and then one of them.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu replies: “When will this Rededjet give birth?”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Djedi says: “It will happen during the first month of the ''peret''-season,&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Egyptian name of the winter season. See: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70. Harrassowitz, Wiesbaden 2008, {{ISBN|3-447-05651-7}}, page 116.&lt;/ref&gt; on the fifteenth day.″&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu becomes indignant: “But it's when the canal-of-two-[[Mugilidae]]&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Egyptian name of the [[Nile]]. See: Verena M. Lepper: ''Untersuchungen zu pWestcar. Eine philologische und literaturwissenschaftliche (Neu-)Analyse''. In: ''Ägyptologische Abhandlungen'', Band 70.

And then I will visit that temple of Ra, lord of Sachebu.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And Djedi says: “Then I will make the waters at the fordable spots of the canal-of-two-Mugilidae become four cubits in height for you.”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; Khufu stands up and orders: “Have Djedi assigned to a place within the palace of my son Djedefhor where he shall live from now on. His daily gainings be 1000 loaves of bread, 100 jars of beer, one neat and 100 bundles of [[field garlic]].”&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt; And all things are done as ordered.&lt;ref name=VeLe&gt;Verena M.

Einleitung und Commentar''. In: ''Mitteilungen aus den Orientalischen Sammlungen''. Heft V, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Berlin 1890. page 10 – 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern analysis==
Historians and Egyptologists such as [[Adolf Erman]] and [[Kurt Heinrich Sethe]] once thought the tales of ''Westcar Papyrus'' were mere [[folklore]]. Magical tricks that show animals being decapitated and their heads being replaced were performed as recently as a few decades ago, though today they are rarely shown because of [[aesthetic]]al and [[ethic]]al misgivings.&lt;ref name=AdEr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Udo Bartsch: ''Unterhaltungskunst A-Z (Taschenbuch der Künste)''. Henschel, Leipzig 1977 (2. Ausgabe), page 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Egyptologists like {{ill|Verena Lepper|de}} and [[Miriam Lichtheim]] deny this view and they argue that Sethe and Erman may have just failed to see the profundity of such novels. They point to multiple similar but somewhat later ancient Egyptian writings in which magicians perform very similar magic tricks and make prophecies to a king. According to Lepper and Lichtheim, their stories are obviously inspired by the tale of Djedi. Descriptive examples are the papyri ''pAthen'' and ''The prophecy of Neferti''. These [[novel]]s show how popular the theme of prophesying already was during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] - just like in the story of the ''Westcar Papyrus.'' And they both talk about subalterns with magical powers similar to those of Djedi's. The Papyrus ''pBerlin 3023'' contains the novel ''The Eloquent Peasant'', in which the following [[phrase]] appears: “See, these are artists who create the existing anew, who even replace a severed head”, which can be interpreted as an allusion to the ''Westcar Papyrus.'' ''pBerlin 3023'' contains another reference which strengthens the idea that many ancient Egyptian novels were influenced by ''Westcar Papyrus'': column 232 contains the phrase ''sleeping until dawn'', which appears nearly word-by-word in the ''Westcar Papyrus.'' Since ''pAthen'', ''pBerlin 3023'' and ''The prophecy of Neferti'' show the same manner of speaking and equal picking up quaint phrases, Lepper and Lichtheim hold that Djedi (and the other wise men from same papyrus) must have been known to Egyptian authors for a long time.&lt;ref name=VeLe/&gt;&lt;ref name=MiLi/&gt;

The '''''Encyclopædia Edinensis''''' was a six-volume general [[encyclopedia]] published in [[Edinburgh]] in 1827, and intended for a popular audience. It was edited by [[James Millar (physician)|James Millar]], who died just before it was complete.&lt;ref name="Miller2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Philip Miller|title=Discovering Water: James Watt, Henry Cavendish, and the Nineteenth Century 'Water Controversy'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orL4QRlvBfYC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=19 May 2012|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3177-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work began on the ''Encyclopædia'' in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;S. Padraig Walsh ''Anglo-American general encyclopedias 1703-1967'' New York and London; R.R. Bowser Company 1968 p.55&lt;/ref&gt; Millar edited the fourth and parted of the fifth editions of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and had contributed extensively to both. His goal with the Edinensis was to create a more popular work. However, his use of a large [[Quarto (binding)|quarto format]], reminiscent of the ''Britannica'' hampered the project as [[duodecimal]], miniature formats were then in vogue.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Collison ''Encyclopedias: their history throughout the ages'' 2nd ed. New York and London; Haffner Publishing Company 1966 p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

== Phrenology ==

The editorial line was quite sympathetic to [[phrenology]]. According to the ''[[Phrenological Journal]]'', Sommers approved the inclusion of the uncritical article "Phrenology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The phrenological journal and miscellany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MrQ6AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA641|accessdate=20 May 2012|year=1824|publisher=s.n.|pages=641–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poole in 1819 wrote for the encyclopedia an article on [[education]], an early treatment from the point of phrenology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Phrenological journal and miscellany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cA3tN3ttpOYC&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=20 May 2012|year=1826|publisher=Printed for the Proprietors|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eros-piccadilly-circus.jpg|thumb|''Anteros'', popularly called ''Eros'', by [[Alfred Gilbert]], 1885; from the Shaftesbury Memorial in [[Piccadilly Circus]].]]

The '''Erotes''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|t|iː|z}}) are a collective of winged gods associated with love and sexual intercourse in [[Greek mythology]]. They are part of [[Aphrodite]]'s [[retinue]]. ''Erotes'' (Greek {{lang|grc|ἔρωτες}}) is the plural of ''[[Eros]]'' ("Love, Desire"), who as a singular deity has a more complex mythology.

Other named Erotes are [[Anteros]] ("Love Returned"),&lt;ref&gt;Emma Stafford, "From the Gymnasium to the Wedding: Eros in Athenian Art and Cult," in ''Erôs in Ancient Greece'' (Oxford University Press, 2013), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Himeros]] ("Impetuous Love" or "Pressing Desire"), [[Hedylogos]] ("Sweet-talk"), [[Hymenaios]] ("Bridal-Hymn"), [[Hermaphroditus]] ("Hermaphrodite" or "Effeminate"), and [[#Pothos|Pothos]] ("Desire, Longing," especially for one who is absent).&lt;ref&gt;Claude Calame, ''The Poetics of Eros in Ancient Greece'' (Princeton University Press, 1999, originally published 1992 in Italian), pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Erotes became a motif of [[Hellenistic art]], and may appear in [[Roman art]] in the alternate form of multiple [[Cupid]]s or [[Cupid and Psyche|Cupids and Psyches]]. In the [[classical tradition|later tradition]] of [[Western art]], erotes become indistinguishable from figures also known as Cupids, amorini, or amoretti.&lt;ref&gt;John Ferguson, ''The Religions of the Roman Empire'' (Cornell University Press, 1970), p. 145; Leonard Barkan, ''Unearthing the Past: Archaeology and Aesthetics in the Making of Renaissance Culture'' (Yale University Press, 1999), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The erotes are a group of winged gods in Classical mythology. They are associated with love and sexual desire, and form part of Aphrodite's retinue. The individual erotes are sometimes linked to particular aspects of love, and are often associated with same-sex desire.&lt;ref name=conner64&gt;Conner, p. 64, "Aphrodite"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=connererot&gt;Conner, p. 133, "Erotes"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=connereros&gt;Conner, p. 132, "Eros"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=connerpoth&gt;Conner, p.270, "Pothos"&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the erotes are regarded as manifestations of a singular god, [[Eros]].&lt;ref&gt;Younger, p. 45, "Eros/Cupid)&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of the erotes' [[mischief]] or [[prank]]s were a popular theme in Hellenistic culture, particularly in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Spells to attract or repel erotes were used, in order to induce love or the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, pp. 100, 167.&lt;/ref&gt;  Different erotes represented various facets of love or desire, such as [[unrequited love]] (Himeros), mutual love (Anteros) or longing (Pothos).&lt;ref name=connererot/&gt;

The erotes were usually portrayed as [[nude]], handsome, winged youths.&lt;ref name=connererot/&gt; The earliest known sculptured [[frieze]]s depicting a group of erotes and winged maidens driving chariots pulled by [[goat]]s, were created to decorate [[theatre]]s in ancient Greece in the 2nd century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Sturgeon, p. 124–25.&lt;/ref&gt; The representation of erotes in such friezes became common, including erotes in [[hunting]] scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Sturgeon, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to their role in the classical mythological pantheon, the erotes' representation is sometimes purely [[symbol]]ic (indicating some form of love) or they may be portrayed as individual characters.&lt;ref name=amoungwom&gt;Rabinowitz &amp; Auanger, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence of erotes in otherwise non-sexual images, such as of two women, has been interpreted to indicate a homoerotic subtext.&lt;ref name=amoungwom/&gt;  In the cult of Aphrodite in [[Anatolia]], [[Iconography|iconographic]] images of the goddess with three erotes symbolized the three realms over which she had dominion: the Earth, sky, and water.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retinue Members==
Groups of numerous erotes are portrayed in ancient Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] art. In addition, a number of named gods have been regarded as erotes, sometimes being assigned particular associations with aspects of love.

===Anteros===
{{main article| Anteros}}

[[Anteros]] (Greek: Ἀντέρως, ''Antérōs'') was the god of requited love, literally "love returned" or "counterpart love".  He punished those who scorned love and the advances of others, and was the avenger of unrequited love.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Anteros was the son of Ares and Aphrodite in [[Greek mythology]], and given to his brother Eros as a playmate because the latter was lonely. In another version, Anteros arose from mutual feelings between [[Poseidon]] and [[Nerites (mythology)|Nerites]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On Animals'', 14. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, Anteros was depicted as similar to Eros in every way, though sometimes with longer hair and butterfly wings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  He has been described as armed with either a [[gold]]en club or arrows of [[lead]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

===Eros===
{{main article|Eros}}
[[File:Eros bobbin Louvre CA1798.jpg|thumb|[[Eros]]. Attic red-figure bobbin, ca. 470–450 BCE.]]
Originally, [[Eros]] was the god of [[love]] and [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]]; he was also worshiped as a [[fertility]] deity. His [[Roman mythology|Roman]] counterpart was [[Cupid]] (desire).

In later myths, he was the son of the deities Aphrodite and [[Ares]]: it is the Eros of these later myths who is one of the erotes.  Eros was associated with athleticism, with statues erected in ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasia]]'',&lt;ref name=connereros/&gt; and "was often regarded as the protector of homosexual love between men."&lt;ref name=connereros/&gt;  Eros was depicted as often carrying a [[lyre]] or bow and arrow.  He was also depicted accompanied by [[dolphin]]s, [[flute]]s, [[rooster]]s, [[rose]]s, and [[torch]]es.&lt;ref name=connereros/&gt;

===Hedylogos===
{{main article| Hedylogos}}

[[Hedylogos]] or Hedylogus ({{lang-grc|Ἡδυλογος}}) was the god of [[wikt:sweet-talk|sweet-talk]] and [[flattery]]. He is not mentioned in any existing literature, but he is depicted on [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek vase paintings]].

===Hermaphroditus===
{{main article| Hermaphroditus}}

[[Hermaphroditus]] was the god of hermaphrodites and of effeminate men. He was the son of [[Hermes]] and [[Aphrodite]]. Born a remarkably handsome boy but after the [[water nymph]] [[Salmacis]] fell in love with him and she prayed to be united forever, their two forms merged into one.

===Himeros===
Himeros (Greek: {{lang|grc|Ἵμερος}} "uncontrollable desire", Latin: ''Himerus'') represented desire and unrequited love.&lt;ref name=younger40&gt;Younger, p. 40, "Desire"&lt;/ref&gt;  Himeros was identified by his carrying a ''[[Tainia (costume)|taenia]]'', a colourful headband worn by athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Conner, p. 178, ''Himerus''&lt;/ref&gt; He is described in [[Theogony|Hesiod's Theogony]] as being born alongside Aphrodite.

===Hymenaeus/Hymen===
{{main article|Hymen (god)}}

[[Hymen (god)|Hymenaeus]] ({{lang-el|Ὑμεναιος}}) or Hymen ({{lang-el|Ὑμην}}) was the god of weddings, marriage, and the bridal hymn.

===Pothos===
[[File:Pothos Via Cavour Musei Capitolini MC2417 n1.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Pothos at the Centrale Montemartini]]
Pothos (Greek: {{lang|grc|Πόθος}} "yearning") was one of [[Aphrodite]]'s erotes and brother to Himeros and Eros. In some versions of myth, Pothos is the son of Eros, or is portrayed as an independent aspect of him.&lt;ref name=connererot/&gt; Yet others called him son of [[Zephyrus]] and [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nonnus]], ''Dionysiaca'', 47. 340&lt;/ref&gt;  He was part of Aphrodite's retinue, and carried a vine, indicating a connection to wine or the god [[Dionysus]]. Pothos represents longing or yearning.&lt;ref name=younger40/&gt; In the temple of [[Aphrodite]] at [[Megara]], there was a sculpture that represented Pothos together with [[Eros]] and Himeros which has been credited to [[Scopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 43. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Pothos is a name for the white [[Asphodelus albus]] flower, "used at funerals" according to [[Arthur Hort]]'s index and translation of [[Theophrastus]] (VI, 8, 3).&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/enquiryintoplant02theouoft&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Food Lovers Companion 3rd.jpg|thumb|Third Edition cover]]The Second Edition is a searchable source text at [[Epicurious]], and the Third Edition is a searchable source text at [[Answers.com]].

[[Sharon Tyler Herbst]]—the primary author—wrote 16 food and beverage related books before her death on January 26, 2007.  Her husband Ron—who writes about wine and cheese—finished editing the Fourth Edition after her death and is credited as the coauthor.

==Reception==
''[[Bon Appetit]]'' hailed the book as “one of the best reference books we’ve seen, a must for every cook’s library”, and the ''[[New York Times]]'' described it “As thick and as satisfying as a well-stuffed sandwich”.&lt;ref&gt;Back cover of the Third and Fourth Editions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous chef [[Emeril Lagasse]] called it his favorite book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2007/01/29/state/n193855S63.DTL |title=Cookbook author and foodie favorite Sharon Tyler Herbst dies |accessdate=2007-02-17 |last=Konrad |first=Rachel |date=January 29, 2007 |publisher=''[[Associated Press]]''}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is required reading at the [[New England Culinary Institute]].

==Deluxe edition==

After the 2007 edition was published, Ron Herbst and the staff of [[Barron's Educational Series]] drastically reorganized the book, breaking out much of the material into specialized glossaries on subjects like chocolate, liqueurs, charcuterie, and spices. This edition was published in hardcover as ''The Deluxe Food Lover's Companion'' and included a marker ribbon bound into the spine. The 2013 fifth edition received a similar treatment in April 2015.

==Fourth edition appendices==

In the deluxe editions, some of these have been folded into the glossary sections.

The '''Frick Collection''' is an [[art museum]] located in the [[Henry Clay Frick House]] on the [[Upper East Side]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] at 1 East 70th Street, at the northeast corner with [[Fifth Avenue]]. It houses the collection of industrialist [[Henry Clay Frick]]  (1849–1919).

== History ==
{{see also|Henry Clay Frick House}}
Henry Frick started his substantial art collection as soon as he started amassing his fortunes. A considerable amount of his art collection is located in his former residence "Clayton" in Pittsburgh, which is today a part of the [[Frick Art &amp; Historical Center]]. Another part was given by his daughter and heiress Helen to the [[Frick Fine Arts Building]], which is on the campus of the University of Pittsburgh.

The family did not permanently move from Pittsburgh to New York until 1905. Henry Frick initially leased the Vanderbilt house at 640 Fifth Avenue, to which he moved a substantial amount of his collection. He had his permanent residence built between 1912 and 1914 by [[Thomas Hastings (architect)|Thomas Hastings]] of [[Carrère and Hastings]]. He stayed in the house until his death in 1919. He willed the house and all of its contents, including art, furniture, and decorative objects, as a public museum. His widow Adelaide Howard Childs Frick, however, retained the right of residence and continued living in the mansion with her daughter Helen. After Adelaide Frick died in 1931, the conversion of the house into a public museum started.

[[John Russell Pope]] altered and enlarged the building in the early 1930s to adapt it to use as a public institution. It opened to the public on December 16, 1935. Various additions to the architecture and landscape architecture of the museum site have been considered over the years including the placement of a prominent magnolia garden from the 1930s. As stated by the museum announcements: "As a result of a decision of the Board of Trustees in 1939, three magnolias were selected for the Fifth Avenue garden. The two trees on the lower tier are Saucer Magnolias ([[Magnolia soulangeana]]) and the species on the upper tier by the flagpole is a Star Magnolia ([[Magnolia stellata]])."&lt;ref&gt;Frick online library. Description of architecture and landscape architecture. [http://www.frick.org/collection/gardens/magnolias].&lt;/ref&gt;

Further expansions of the museum took place in 1977 and in 2011. In 2014, the museum announced further expansion plans, but came up against community opposition because it would result in the loss of a garden.  The Frick ultimately dropped those plans and is said to be considering other options.&lt;ref&gt;Pogebrin, Robin (June 9, 2014) [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/arts/design/frick-plans-changes-but-vows-to-stay-the-same.html "Frick Seeks to Expand Beyond Jewel-Box Spaces"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pogebrin, Robin (November 9, 2014) [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/arts/fricks-plan-for-expansion-faces-fight-over-loss-of-garden.html?_r=1 "Frick’s Plan for Expansion Faces Fight Over Loss of Garden"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pogebrin, Robin (June 3, 2015) [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/nyregion/frick-museum-abandons-contested-renovation-plan.html "Frick Museum Abandons Contested Renovation Plan"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The Frick is one of the pre-eminent small art museums in the United States, with a high-quality collection of [[old master]] paintings and fine furniture housed in nineteen galleries of varying size within the former residence. Frick had intended the mansion to become a museum eventually, and a few of the paintings are still arranged according to Frick's design. Besides its permanent collection, the Frick has always organized small, focused temporary exhibitions.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Carol Vogel (September 7, 1998), [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/07/arts/director-tries-gentle-changes-for-the-frick.html Director Tries Gentle Changes For the Frick] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection features some of the best-known paintings by major European artists as well as numerous works of [[sculpture]] and [[porcelain]]. It also has 18th-century [[French furniture]], [[Limoges porcelain|Limoges]] [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], and [[Oriental rug]]s.&lt;ref name= "FC: About"/&gt; After Frick's death, his daughter, [[Helen Clay Frick]], and the Board of Trustees expanded the collection: nearly half of the collection's artworks have been acquired since 1919. Although the museum cannot lend the works of art that belonged to Frick, as stipulated in his will, The Frick Collection does lend artworks and objects acquired since his death.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Included in the collection are [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]'s masterpiece ''The Progress of Love'', three paintings by [[Johannes Vermeer]] including ''[[Mistress and Maid]]'', two paintings by [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] including ''[[View of the Dam and Damrak at Amsterdam (Frick Collection)|Quay at Amsterdam]]'',&lt;ref name="frick"&gt;{{cite web | url=
http://collections.frick.org/view/people/asitem/items@:159?t:state:flow=bc0a6c04-cae8-4802-a5e9-0b91dad49af9|title = Jacob van Ruisdael|publisher = Frick Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Piero della Francesca]]'s ''St. John the Evangelist''.

==Temporary Exhibits==
The Frick is known to have extraordinary temporary exhibits.  When the [[Mauritshuis]] was under reconstruction, key and rare works like [[Vermeer]]'s [[Girl with a Pearl Earring]] and  [[Fabritius]]’s  [[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]] toured the United States, and was exhibited at the Frick in 2013 as opposed to other venues available in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url= https://www.frick.org/exhibitions/past/2013/mauritshuis|title=Past Exhibition: Vermeer, Rembrandt, and Hals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Frick Art Reference Library ==
{{see also|Frick Art Reference Library}}
The Frick Collection oversees the nearby [[Frick Art Reference Library]]. The collections held at the library focus on art of the Western tradition from the fourth century to the mid-twentieth century, and chiefly include information about paintings, drawings, sculpture, prints, and illuminated manuscripts. Archival materials augment its research collections. Opened in 1920, the library quickly became a prime resource for students.&lt;ref&gt;John Russell (November 10, 1984), [https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/10/obituaries/helen-clay-frick-dies-at-96-founded-art-library-in-1920.html Helen Clay Frick Dies At 96] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==

=== Attendance ===
According to ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', the Frick Collection has a typical annual attendance of 275,000 to 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Halperin (January 11, 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Fricks-finch-lays-golden-egg/31556 Frick’s finch lays golden egg] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

=== Governance ===
In 2011, Ian Wardropper succeeded [[Anne Poulet]], who had run the Frick Collection as director since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Taylor and Carol Vogel (May 19, 2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/arts/design/the-frick-collection-names-a-new-director.html The Frick Collection Names a New Director] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Poulet took the position after Samuel Sachs II stepped down after running the institution for six years. Poulet was the first female director of the Frick.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 2010"&gt;Carol Vogel (September 22, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/arts/design/23museum.html Director of Frick Collection Will Retire in Fall of 2011] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; During her time at the Frick Collection, Poulet increased the museum’s small [[board of trustees]], adding 10 new members. She also introduced the Director’s Circle, a group of 44 members who each give a minimum of $25,000 a year to the Frick Collection, although many have made significantly larger contributions.&lt;ref name="Carol Vogel 2010"/&gt;

=== Funding ===
By 1997, the Frick Collection had an operating budget of $10 million and an endowment of $170 million.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Vogel (May 13, 1997), [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/13/arts/frick-finds-its-director-in-detroit.html Frick Finds Its Director In Detroit] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its large endowment, the institution still needs money to preserve the building.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

'''George Pickingill''' (c. 1816 – 10 April 1909) was an English [[Farmworker|farm labourer]] who lived and worked in the village of [[Canewdon]] in the [[Eastern England|eastern English]] county of [[Essex]]. Widely considered to be a [[Cunning folk in Britain|cunning man]], or vocational [[folk magic]]ian, he reportedly employed magical means to offer cures for ailments and to locate lost property, although was also alleged to have threatened to place [[curse]]s on people.

Born into a rural working-class family, Pickingill grew up in [[Hockley]], Essex and was baptised into the [[Church of England]]. Working as a farm labourer, in 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman in [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]]. The couple moved back to Essex, settled in Canewdon and had four children. Pickingill's wife died in 1887, and in later life he attracted limited press attention for his claim to be one of the oldest men in England. These claims also appeared in his obituaries, although were later shown to be incorrect.

Pickingill was brought to wider public attention in the early 1960s by the folklorist [[Eric Maple]]. As part of his research into beliefs regarding folk magic and witchcraft in nineteenth-century Essex, Maple had interviewed a number of Canewdon residents and collected their stories about Pickingill and his reputation as a cunning man. According to their accounts, Pickingill attracted visitors from around Essex seeking his magical help, for which he did not charge. They attributed to him the power to control animals, to command [[imp]]s to do his bidding, and to wield power over either six or nine malevolent witches who lived in Canewdon. It was also claimed that he was able to coerce assistance and beer from local residents by threatening to place a curse upon them or their belongings. Although it has been suggested that local people were inventing claims to please Maple, many of which were based on older tales regarding the Essex cunning man [[James Murrell]], subsequent research by historian [[Ronald Hutton]] has confirmed aspects of the folklorist's original accounts.

In the 1970s, the [[occultism|occultist]] E.W. "Bill" Liddell began publicising claims that secretive hereditary witch families had informed him that Pickingill was not simply a rural cunning man but that he was a major figure in the nineteenth-century [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] community. According to Liddell's account—which has failed to receive any scholarly support—Pickingill was a member of a hereditary [[witch-cult hypothesis|witch-cult]], leading a Canewdon [[coven]] and forming nine other covens across southern England. Liddell claimed that Pickingill reformed the established English witch-cult by introducing new concepts from French and Danish witchcraft and from [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] sources, and that in doing so, Pickingill created the structure from which [[Gardnerian Wicca]] emerged in the 1950s. Prominent [[Wicca]]ns [[Doreen Valiente]] and [[Lois Bourne]] have expressed criticism of his claims, which have also been rejected as spurious by such historians and scholars of religion as Maple, Hutton, [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]], and [[Aidan A. Kelly]].

== Biography ==

=== Life and family ===

George Pickingill was the son of Charles Pickingill, a labourer and blacksmith, and Susannah Cudner, a woman who also went by the name of Hannah Cudmore; the couple had married on 17 September 1813.{{sfnm|1a1=Liddell|1a2=Howard|1y=1994|1p=15|2a1=Wallworth|2y=2012}} Although he had no known [[birth record]], according to parish records, George Pickingill was [[baptism|baptised]] on 26 May 1816 at the church in [[Hockley]].{{sfnm|1a1=Liddell|1a2=Howard|1y=1994|1p=15|2a1=Wallworth|2y=2012}} The year of Pickingill's birth is however in question, as he made differing claims in different censuses; in the [[United Kingdom Census 1851|1851 census]], he claimed to be 26, meaning that his birth would have occurred ''circa'' 1825, while in the [[United Kingdom Census 1861|1861 census]], he claimed to be 46, which would have placed his birth c.1815. By the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 1901|1901 census]], he was claiming to be 95, moving his birth to c.1806; it has been suggested that he made himself appear older to ease the process of collecting parish assistance from the church.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} Throughout his life, Pickingill would also use a variety of different spellings of his surname on official records, including ''Pickengill'', ''Pickingale'', ''Pickengal'', ''Pettingale'', ''Pitengale'', and ''Pittengale''.{{sfnm|1a1=Liddell|1a2=Howard|1y=1994|1p=15|2a1=Wallworth|2y=2012}}

It is apparent from census data that Pickingill lived with his parents from 1816 until the 1830s, although it is not stated where he was living at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 1841|1841 census]].{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} In 1851, he was recorded as lodging in the household of David Clemens in [[Little Wakering]], Essex, and describing himself as a farm labourer by profession.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} On 18 May 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman at [[St George's Church, Gravesend|St George's Church]], an [[Church of England|Anglican]] church in [[Gravesend]], Kent.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} In that record, both Pickingill and Bateman described themselves as residing in Gravesend, and Pickingill declared that he was working as a labourer; no profession was listed for Bateman.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} Bateman was born c.1831 in [[Tillingham]], Essex, as the daughter of Joseph Bateman and his wife Mary Ann Aggus; throughout married life, she identified as "Mary Ann Pickingill" and appeared as "Sarah Ann Pittengale" in her burial record.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}}

On 22 June 1858 the couple's daughter, Martha Ann, was born in [[Hawkwell]], Essex.  By 1861 they had moved to [[Eastwood, Essex|Eastwood]], Essex, where they were recorded in that year's census.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} Here, Pickingill described himself as an agricultural labourer.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} That same year, their son Charles Frederick was born.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} The following year, Pickingill's wife was caught stealing two [[peck]]s of potatoes, and subsequently fined ten [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} In 1863, a second daughter, named Mary Ann, was born to the couple.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[Pickingill] still gets his own meals ready, and fills in odd moments by pottering about in the garden. 'Yes, I'm a hundred and five,' he said, 'and feel good for another 20 years. I was born in Hockley, and I've been in these parts, working on farms, all my life. I only stopped working at 90.' The aged man has never seen a railway train. A Press representative took the 'old boy' for a ride round in a motor car, much to his delight. 'I'd like to go to London on it,' he said. 'I've never been to London.' When asked how to live to be 105, he laughed and said, 'You just go on living – that's all.' He still likes his pipe of tobacco and mug of ale."|source=— ''Essex Newsman'', 19 September 1908.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} }}

At some point in the coming four years, the Pickingill family moved to Canewdon, where another son, George, was born in 1876.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} The couple and their four children were then recorded in the 1871 census, where Pickingill was again listed as working as an agricultural labourer.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} In the 1881 census, the couple were recorded as living with two of their children, Mary Ann and George, and Pickingill was again identifying as a labourer.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} On 17 August 1887, a homeless man named James Taylor stole a jacket and pair of leather gloves from Pickingill. Taylor was arrested and brought to trial in [[Rochford]] on 24 August; in October, he pleaded guilty to the theft of the jacket, although not to those of the other items. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment with hard labour.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}}

On 13 September 1887 Pickingill's wife died at the age of 63 in Canewdon; her death was attributed to a disease of the liver by the certifying doctor.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} She was buried at Canewdon's St. Nicholas Church on 17 September.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} According to the 1891 census, Pickingill was still employed as an agricultural labourer, and was living in Canewdon with his married daughter Marry Ann and his granddaughter, Emily Wood.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} Records show that he was living in a rented cottage with an adjacent garden, and that in July 1899 the owner sold the property at auction.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} By 1901 he was listed as living on parish relief, with his two sons back living with him.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}}

By this time, Pickingill was increasingly inflating his age, eventually claiming that he was 105 years old. This attracted attention from other areas, including London, and in September 1908 a journalist visited Canewdon; he arrived by automobile, the first that Pickingill had ever seen, and allowed the old man to ride in it.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} The journalist subsequently wrote an article about the alleged centegenerian, in which he claimed that his name was "Frederick Pickingale"; it is possible that Pickingill gave the false name so that no one would be able to look up the parish records and discover his real age.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}}
Maple described Pickingill as "a tall, unkempt man, solitary and uncommunicative. He had very long finger-nails, and kept his money in a purse of sacking". He also noted that he had worked as a farm labourer and that he was a widower with two sons.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=247}}

=== Magical activities ===
[[File:Canewdon essex 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Aerial photo of Canewdon, 2007]]
The first printed account of Pickingill that described him as a [[Cunning folk|cunning man]] appeared fifty years after his death.{{sfn|Ward|2014a|pp=21–22}} This was provided by the folkorist Eric Maple, who was making a systematic study of nineteenth-century traditions regarding witchcraft and magic in south-eastern Essex,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=295}} and who examined the case of Canewdon in the winter of 1959–60.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=241}} He had begun his enquiries by meeting with a number of elderly local residents at the home of the schoolmistress, from whom he gained a variety of tales pertaining to magical practices in the village.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=242}} His initial findings were published in 1960 in the scholarly journal ''[[Folklore (journal)|Folklore]]'', produced by [[The Folklore Society]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=295}} Maple followed this article with a shorter piece written for 'Essex Countryside Magazine' (Vol.18 No.58 - November 1961). He subsequently produced a sensationalist popular history of witchcraft, ''The Dark World of Witches'' (1962), in which he repeated many of the claims regarding Pickingill. In this work, he erroneously described south-eastern Essex as the last bastion of English witchcraft beliefs, and ignored scholarly conventions in relating his information, resulting in a critical reception from folklorists; the book nevertheless was popular and sold well.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=296}}

Maple noted that, unusually—given his role as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his recorded roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk.{{sfnm|1a1=Maple|1y=1960|1p=247|2a1=Maple|2y=1965|2p=185}} According to one account, he cured a woman of [[rheumatism]] by transferring the ailment to her father.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=247}} Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use [[curse|cursing]] and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as [[James Murrell]].{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=247}} At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone.{{sfn|Maple|1965|p=184}} He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to set upon them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=247}} Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=248}}

Pickingill was also known for his purported ability to control animals, namely horses, and it was believed that when he struck a [[hedgerow]] with his stick, [[game animals]] would run out that could then be caught, killed and eaten.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=248}} It was also rumoured that he could do things faster than ordinary human beings, and that he could do an hour's job in only a few minutes, with some believing that he got his [[imp]]s—his [[familiar spirit]]s—to do the job for him.{{sfnm|1a1=Maple|1y=1960|1p=248|2a1=Maple|2y=1965|2pp=184–185}} Maple also noted that people who visited his cottage reported seeing ornaments and furniture dancing around the room of their own accord; the folklorist believed that this story had originated in a Dutch folkloric tradition that may have been imported to Essex when many Dutch migrants settled there in the seventeenth century.{{sfnm|1a1=Maple|1y=1960|1p=248|2a1=Maple|2y=1965|2p=185}}

According to Maple, Pickingill was sufficiently well known in Essex as an accomplished cunning man that people came to visit him from outside Canewdon in search of magical aid, sometimes "from great distances", including men from the Essex village of [[Dengie]], who sought his advice in a wage dispute.{{sfn|Maple|1960|pp=247–248}} Meanwhile, as Maple noted, Canewdon had developed a reputation associating it with [[witchcraft]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] by the end of the nineteenth century, when it was often thought of as "The Witch Country" and avoided by many wagoners who feared having their vehicles bewitched.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=241}} This was possibly due to its relative isolation from neighbouring settlements, as it was surrounded by [[marshland]], and the insular nature of its community.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=241}} Maple recorded that in this period there was a rumour that there were either six or nine elderly women living in Canewdon who were malevolent witches and used their magic to harm others. It was believed that whilst they were not known to one another, they all owed their allegiance to a singular wizard or master of witches,{{sfn|Maple|1960|pp=242–243}} and there was a rumour in the local community that Pickingill himself was this figure.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=248}} It was claimed that as "Master of Witches", Pickingill simply had to whistle in order for these nine witches to stand by their front doors and reveal their identities,{{sfnm|1a1=Maple|1y=1960|1p=248|2a1=Maple|2y=1965|2p=184}} or that alternately he could "will them" to dance for him in the local churchyard.{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=248}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="When my sister and I were children, we wanted to ride our pony and trap to Rochford Fair; but that day the beast just wouldn't move, no matter what we did with it. Then we suddenly saw George Pickingill staring at us with those terrible eyes of his. He came over and told us to put down the reins and not to interfere with the pony at all. Then he whispered in its ear for a few minutes and stood back and hit it; and it started off, and found its way down the lanes to Rochford, without our needing to touch it."|source=— Jack Taylor, interviewed by Ronald Hutton, 1967.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=297}} }}

Subsequent researchers also travelled to Canewdon to meet with Maple's informants and confirm his account for themselves. In April 1967 [[Ronald Hutton]] visited the village where he met with elderly resident Lillian Garner, who had been one of Maple's informants. He also found an informant that Maple had not encountered, an old man named Jack Taylor, then living in a [[retirement home]]. Taylor claimed that as a young man he knew Pickingill, and that the latter had the power of horse-whispering—the magical ability to command horses to do his bidding. On the whole, Hutton found that the account of Pickingill among the local people to whom he spoke was entirely consistent with that provided by Maple.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=297}}{{efn|After being queried on the year in question, Ronald Hutton confirmed to Michael Howard that the 1967 date was correct, and that he had been thirteen years old at the time in which he undertook these inquiries at Canewdon.{{sfn|Howard|2014b|p=46}} }} In 1977 Hutton was followed by the [[Gardnerian Wicca]]n initiate [[Michael Howard (Witch)|Michael Howard]], who met with Garner, then eighty-seven years old.{{sfnm|1a1=Liddell|1a2=Howard|1y=1994|1p=4|2a1=Howard|2y=2011|2p=113}} On this occasion, she recalled Pickingill being photographed with the first car to arrive in the village, and also gave Howard the original copy of a photograph of him that was in her possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Liddell|1a2=Howard|1y=1994|1p=4|2a1=Howard|2y=2011|2p=114}} She then added the information—which she had not given to Maple or Hutton—that her own mother had talked of Pickingill leading a local [[coven]], and that he received "many visitors" from "a long way away" who sought his magical knowledge.{{sfn|Howard|2011|p=114}}

A different account was provided by [[Charles Lefebvre (American author)|Charles Lefebvre]], an American author of the sensationalist ''Witness to Witchcraft'' (1970). Here, his use of sources was unclear, although he asserted that Pickingill had had an ageless body, was a relative of [[Roma people]], was the last survivor of an old witch family, held [[Black Mass]]es and orgies in the church yard, and was visited by "black magicians" from across Europe. According to Lefebvre, Pickingill was finally killed when confronted by the sign of the cross.{{sfnm|1a1=Lefebvre|1y=1970|1pp=51–56|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2pp=296–297}} Hutton later described these as "fantasies" which served to support Lefebvre's view that witchcraft should be criminalised.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=297}}

However, claims have since been made that Pickingill was not a cunning man or involved in folk magic at all. Local Canewdon historian Sylvia Webster expressed her view to Howard that tales regarding Pickingill's magical practices had been invented by the locals of Canewdon to impress Maple. Supporting this position, she highlighted that there was no evidence to suggest that Pickingill was a cunning man prior to Maple's publications.{{sfnm|1a1=Howard|1y=2011|1p=134|2a1=Ward|2y=2014a|2p=21}} Similarly, Richard Ward argued that the contemporary obituaries and interviews conducted with Pickingill had shown no evidence of any magical activities, when such might have been expected.{{sfn|Ward|2014a|p=22}} Ward suggested that many of the stories regarding Pickingill's magical activities were adapted from those of a genuine Essex cunning man, [[James Murrell]].{{sfn|Ward|2014a|p=22}} Hutton responded critically to Ward's claims, highlighting his own investigations into the local folklore and his interview with Taylor to express the view that there "seems little doubt" that Pickingill was a cunning man, although "there are still questions over what sort of one he was".{{sfn|Hutton|2014|p=6}} At the same time, Hutton also accepted the possibility that some of the legends associated with Murrell had come to be associated with Pickingill, although stated that this seemed to be "incapable of solid proof".{{sfn|Hutton|2014|p=6}} In his counter-response to Hutton, Ward accepting that Pickingill could have been associated with "some apparent supernatural control or knowledge of horses" as Taylor had claimed, but that this did not automatically make him a cunning man, for which there remained no contemporary historical evidence.{{sfn|Ward|2014b|p=46}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Canewdonchurch.jpg|thumb|150px|Canewdon's St Nicholas Church, Pickingill's burial site]]
According to Maple's account, in the last few weeks of Pickingill's life, when he had become very ill, the local people moved him to the [[First aid room|infirmary]] against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers. Many locals interpreted this as coming true when as the [[hearse]] carrying his coffin drew up to the churchyard, the horses stepped out of their [[Horse harness|harness shafts]].{{sfn|Maple|1960|p=248}} His body was subsequently buried in the church's graveyard, whilst his abandoned house gradually became dilapidated before falling down.{{sfnm|1a1=Maple|1y=1960|1p=248|2a1=Maple|2y=1965|2p=185}}

According to his [[death certificate]], "George Pettingale" died on 10 April 1909 at the age of 103, and his cause of death was "senile decay" and "cardiac failure".{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} He was buried at Canewdon's St Nicholas Church on 14 April; although his stated age of 103 was recorded, the vicar added a note asserting that this was erroneous, for in reality Pickingill was "born at Hockley 1816 [and] was only in his 93rd year".{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}}

Pickingill's death attracted national press attention. It was claimed in both the ''Essex Newsman'' and ''[[The Times]]'' that he was "believed to be the oldest man in England"; these publications recorded his age as 106.{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}} The story was also picked up by New Zealand newspaper ''[[The Star (Christchurch)|The Star]]'', in which he was described as "the oldest man in England".{{sfn|Wallworth|2012}}

According to Maple, Pickingill left "a legacy of myth which is curiously alien to the general run of witch traditions. In all the stories told of Pickingill there is a subtle undercurrent of horror which one finds hard to pinpoint. Possibly it arises from the fact that many of those who recount the tales actually knew the man and experienced just such a quiet terror when he passed them in the village street."{{sfn|Maple|1965|p=184}}

== Bill Liddell's claims ==
In 1974, a writer began sending articles to Pagan newsletter ''[[The Wiccan]]'', then edited by the Gardnerian Wiccan John Score, articulating an alternative account of Pickingill's life and relation to the British occult movement. First identifying himself only as "a well wisher", he later began using the pseudonym Lugh, named for [[Lugh|the Irish mythological figure]].{{sfnm|1a1=Valiente|1y=1989|1p=197|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=289|3a1=Howard|3y=2009|3p=44|4a1=Howard|4y=2011|4pp=114–115}} In 1977, Lugh ceased sending the articles to ''The Wiccan'' and instead began publishing them in a rival British magazine, ''[[The Cauldron]]'', edited by Michael Howard; he claimed to have switched outlets because ''The Wiccan'' had been too dominated by Gardnerian perspectives.{{sfnm|1a1=Valiente|1y=1989|1p=197|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=289|3a1=Howard|3y=2011|3p=115}} Lugh later revealed his name to be E.W. "Bill" Liddell, describing himself as an Englishman born in [[Essex]]. He added that ''circa'' 1960 he had moved to [[Auckland]], New Zealand, before later relocating to Australia, from where he wrote his articles.{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=289|2a1=Howard|2y=2009|2p=44}} In a 1984 letter he  noted that he was not born with the surname of Liddell but had instead adopted it later in life.{{sfn|Ward|2014a|p=21}} Claiming that Pickingill had been the first-cousin of his paternal great-great grandfather, Liddell asserted that he had been initiated into his family's hereditary form of witchcraft in 1950,{{sfnm|1a1=Bisseker|1a2=Liddell|1y=2006|2a1=Howard|2y=2009|2pp=44, 47}} and that he had subsequently been initiated into both the Gardnerian and [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian]] traditions of Wicca.{{sfn|Howard|2009|pp=44, 47}} His partner, Sylvia Tatham, had been heavily involved in the development of the Alexandrian tradition in the early 1960s, having been one of those present when its founder, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], was initiated into the Gardnerian tradition.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=323}} In 1982, Wiccan Publications collected together and published these articles as two pamphlets: ''Old George Pickingill and the Roots of Modern Witchcraft'' and ''Medieval Witchcraft and the Freemasons''.{{sfn|Valiente|1989|p=197}} The articles were republished in one single volume in 1994 as ''The Pickingill Papers'', edited by Liddell and Howard.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The Lugh corpus was expressly written to be confrontational. Several surviving Craft families, a number of solitaries, and my own Brethren were at first amused – and then alarmed – at the Witchcraft beliefs being propounded by Gerald Gardner and Alex Sanders. The tenets of Wicca bore little resemblance to the rites and practices of [[Traditional Witchcraft]] in England. My Brethren decided to take the bull by the horns and find a public platform to explain that there were a number of disparate witch traditions."|source=— Bill Liddell, 1999.{{sfnm|1a1=Bisseker|1a2=Liddell|1y=2006}} }}

Liddell's claims regarding Pickingill are self-contradictory.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}} Liddell explained this by stating that the information contained in his articles had been passed on to him by three separate sources, all of which had decided to use him as a mouthpiece for their own claims. The first were the members of a hereditary tradition of Pagan witchcraft, while the second were the practitioners of a similar yet separate tradition of Pagan witchcraft which, Liddell alleged, had been greatly influenced by Pickingill in the nineteenth century. The third source cited by Liddell was his own experiences gained from being born into a witchcraft family and subsequently being initiated into both of the aforementioned traditions and a separate "cunning lodge".{{sfnm|1a1=Hutton|1y=1999|1p=290|2a1=Bisseker|2a2=Liddell|2y=2006}} He claimed that most of the information that he was publishing came from "Elders", or older members, involved in the first two of these traditions, and that as such he could not vouch for its accuracy,{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}} going so far as to state that he doubted the veracity of much of it.{{sfn|Howard|2009|p=47}}

Noting that these Elders themselves had very different opinions on Gardnerian Wicca,{{sfn|Howard|2009|p=45}} he also stated that the Elders ceased providing him with new information in the early 1980s.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}} He stated that these various Elders had chosen him to disseminate the information because he had been involved in both hereditary witchcraft and Gardnerian Wicca and because he was based in New Zealand, thereby making it hard for anyone to trace their identities.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=17–18}} Despite Liddell claiming that the material he was putting forward came from various sources, the historian Ronald Hutton noted that it was all presented in a "single, dogmatic, authorial voice", with no indication of where the different pieces of information came from.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=292}} Hutton also asserted that Liddell's changing claims would be entirely consistent with a single individual making up stories and changing them as they went along.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=292}}

===Liddell's account===
According to Liddell's initial 1974 claims, since the eleventh century the Pickingill family had been priests of a pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to the worship of the [[Horned God]].{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=25}} In this, his claims fitted within the historical framework of the discredited [[witch-cult hypothesis]] as propagated in the works of [[Margaret Murray]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=291}} Later he added that the "medieval witch cult" was influenced by the "tenets" of the Iron Age [[druids]], in particular their knowledge of [[ley lines]] which were marked out by the [[stone circles in the British Isles and Brittany|stone circles erected in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages]].{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=65, 71}} Conflicting with these ideas, in 1998 Liddell personally informed Hutton that the witch-cult did not derive from ancient pre-Christian religion but that it instead had been founded in fifteenth-century France, emerging from a union between Christian heretics, cunning lodges, and a cult of [[Lucifer]] founded by [[Islam]]ic [[Moors]] with the intent of undermining Christianity.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=291}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="[George Pickingill] was more famous in his heydey than Crowley was in his. Old George was acknowledged as the world's greatest living authority on witchcraft, Satanism and black magic. He was consulted by occultists of every hue and tradition who came from all over Europe, England and even America."|source=— Bill Liddell, 1974.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=27}} }}

Liddell claimed that the Pickingill family had many links to the travelling [[Romani people|Romani]] population, and that Pickingill spent many of his early years in a Romani caravan. Liddell claimed that Pickingill faced persecution as a result, and that he "set out to terrify" the locals of Canewdon in retaliation.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=90}} According to Liddell, Pickingill was trained in Romani magic, and thus in later life became "the most famous [[:wikt:kako#Romani|gypsy kako]] in England".{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=91}} Liddell also claimed that Pickingill despised Christianity and wanted to see it overthrown; to this end he collaborated with [[Theistic Satanism|Satanists]] and included Satanic elements within his ritual practices, something which horrified other members of the East Anglian witch-cult.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=27}} Thus, according to Liddell, Pickingill was "England's most feared and vilified 'Satanist'".{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=23}} Elsewhere, he stressed that Pickingill was not a Satanist, but rather that he had been considered such by other witches because he practised [[sex magic]].{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=119–120}}

Liddell asserted that Pickingill spent time in France, where he was initiated into a local form of the witch-cult.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=91}} According to this account, upon his return to Canewdon, Pickingill was invited to lead a local coven which had been operating since the mid-fifteenth century—the "Seven Witches of Canewdon"—and that he continued to lead the group until disbanding it several years prior to his death.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=90–91}} Liddell added that Pickingill proceeded to introduce many new innovations into the English witch-cult by applying concepts borrowed from the Danish and French witch-cults, namely the idea that the coven should be led by a woman.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=25–26}} Liddell asserted that Pickingill then established nine covens in England, spread out in Essex, Norfolk, Hertfordshire, Sussex, and Hampshire;{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=28}} he further added that two of those covens, based in Hertfordshire and Norfolk, survived into at least the 1970s.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=98}} According to Liddell, Pickingill was propagating witchcraft in a reformed, female-oriented form because the oncoming [[Age of Aquarius]] would be more receptive to this form of spirituality.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=118}}

In Liddell's account, Pickingill travelled widely and joined a variety of cunning lodges, gaining access to their [[grimoires]] and libraries.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=166}} According to Liddell, from the 1850s onward Pickingill began co-operating with a group of [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] who considered themselves to be [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucians]] and who wanted to prove that Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism were "siblings" of the witch-cult.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=40}} Two of these Freemasons, [[Hargrave Jennings]] and W.J. Hughan, became pupils of Pickingill, who aided them in producing a Rosicrucian Manifesto that was used in the formation of the [[Societas Rosicruciana]] in 1865.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=41–43}} According to Liddell, Pickingill's involvement with Freemasons also led to the foundation of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] in 1888.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=41}} Liddell also asserted that Pickingill was influenced by a coven that had been founded in the early nineteenth century by a group of [[Cambridge University]] academics led by [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]] and whose rituals were based largely on [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] sources.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=100–101}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=rightt|quote="The rites [George Pickingill] drafted emphasised ritual nudity, nature worship, the unity of the Goddess, female dominance, the five-fold kiss—without the words 'Blessed Be'—the Drawing Down of the Moon, the Goddess Charge, the Legend of the Goddess, induction by the opposite sex, a tri-gradal initiation structure, the use of magical cords etc. It is difficult not to recognise the basic features of what is now Gardnerian Wicca."|source=— Bill Liddell, 1984.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=106}} }}

Liddell also claimed that the prominent occultist [[Aleister Crowley]] had been initiated into one of these nine covens as a young man. According to this account, Crowley had been introduced to the coven in 1899 or 1900 by his magical mentor, [[Allan Bennett]].{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=22}} Liddell asserted that Crowley was subsequently ejected from the coven for his misbehaviour.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=22–23}} As evidence for these claims, he stated that his own grandfather had been present on three occasions at which Bennett and Crowley met with Pickingill, and that he had seen a photograph in which the three figures are together.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=22}} When asked to present this photograph for public scrutiny in 1977, Liddell claimed that it was "not available"; when independently asked again in 1983, he asserted that it had been stolen by "interested parties".{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=33}}

Further, Liddell stated that one of Pickingill's covens was the [[New Forest coven]], a Wiccan group which [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]—the founder of Gardnerian Wicca—claimed had initiated him in 1939. However, Liddell did later state that he was not certain whether this was true. He also asserted that Gardner later joined another of the Pickingill covens, based in Hertfordshire, through which he received "the Second Rite of the Hereditary Craft". Liddell stressed that this group was separate from Gardner's own [[Bricket Wood coven]]. He furthermore claimed that Gardner received the "Third Rite" from an East Anglian coven, with this three-degree system of initiation influencing [[Gardnerian Wicca#Covens and initiatory lines|that in Gardnerian Wicca]].{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|pp=24, 98–99, 104}} As a result, he stated that the structure and rituals of Gardnerian Wicca were based on those devised by Pickingill, and that "no impartial observer could fail to see that they formed the nucleus of the rites of Wicca."{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=91}} Liddell believed that while many hereditary witches despised him, Gardner represented "the spiritual heir of Pickingill", because he had similarly reformed and propagated witchcraft for contemporary purposes.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=28}}

===Pagan response===

Liddell's claims have received a mixed response from the British Wiccan community. Score championed them in private letters to his correspondents, declaring that they proved that the Gardnerian tradition had historical origins predating Gardner.{{sfn|Howard|2009|p=55}} His successor as editor of ''The Wiccan'', Leonora James, was intrigued by Liddell's claims and investigated the original records pertaining to Pickingill's life; however, by the 1980s she had concluded that Liddell's claims were spurious.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}} In her 1978 book ''Witchcraft for Tomorrow'', the Wiccan [[Doreen Valiente]] – who had been Gardner's High Priestess in the [[Bricket Wood coven]] during the 1950s—stated that she had an "East Anglian source" from Essex who claimed that many of Liddell's assertions were correct. In particular, the informant championed Liddell's claims that Crowley had been an initiate of one of Pickingill's covens.{{sfn|Valiente|1978|pp=17–20}} By the time of her 1989 book ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Valiente was more sceptical of Liddell's claims, noting that any supporting evidence was "still sadly lacking".{{sfn|Valiente|1989|p=199}}

[[File:Lois Bourne.JPG|thumb|left|Lois Bourne ''(pictured in 2010)'' is one of the prominent Wiccans to have criticised Liddell's claims.]]

Another of Gardner's High Priestesses, [[Lois Bourne]], asserted that she was "as sure as I can be" that Gardner had nothing to do with any witches from Canewdon and that if they existed in the first place, then they must have belonged to a tradition distinct from Gardnerian Wicca.{{sfn|Bourne|1998|p=106}} Privately, the Gardnerian initiate and founder of Alexandrian Wicca, [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]], rejected the claims that Liddell made.{{sfn|Howard|2009|pp=55–56}} In his 2013 biography of Valiente, Jonathan Tapsell stated that the Liddell material was "generally regarded as a hoax", being "a spurious history at best, or a malicious prank at worst."{{sfn|Tapsell|2013|p=64}} Hutton asserted that the only "sustained champion" of Liddell's claims has been Michael Howard, noting that he had defended such ideas in a "limited and measured" manner.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}} Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White noted that in his history of the Traditional Witchcraft movement, ''Children of Cain'', Howard "remains cautious and refrains from accepting [Liddell's claims] outright".{{sfn|Doyle White|2011|p=275}} Howard has maintained that he keeps an "open mind" about Liddell's claims, noting that while no evidence has been brought forward to substantiate them, similarly he does not believe that "any real evidence" has been brought forth to disprove them.{{sfn|Howard|2014|p=22}}

Support for Liddell's story came from [[Cecil Williamson]], founder of the [[Museum of Witchcraft]], who claimed to have known about Pickingill through his acquaintances with both Crowley and Gardner.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=218}} However, Williamson was an unreliable source, and was known to repeatedly fabricate claims regarding past events.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=219}} Another figure, known only as Colonel Lawrence, also supported Liddell's story, asserting that his own great-grandmother had studied under Pickingill and thus had been introduced to Crowley; as with Williamson's, however, Lawrence's claims are unreliable, particularly as he has made the unsupported claim that his great-grandmother studied witchcraft under the American folklorist [[Charles Leland]].{{sfn|Hutton|1999|pp=218–219}} Also supporting Liddell's claims was the Wiccan Ralph Harvey, who, following the publication of Liddell's material, publicly declared that in the 1950s or 1960s he had been initiated into one of Pickingill's Nine Covens, located in [[Storrington]], Sussex.{{sfn|Howard|2011|pp=130–131}} Following the publication of Liddell's claims, a number of covens appeared in both the United States and Australia claiming to be practitioners of a tradition originating with Pickingill.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}} Liddell himself has been critical of such groups, expressing his regret that the material he published led to their formation.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=14}}

===Academic response===

[[File:Aleister Crowley.jpg|thumb|150px|Liddell's assertion that occultist Aleister Crowley ''(pictured in 1912)'' was an initiate of one of Pickingill's covens has been heavily scrutinised and discredited.]]

Liddell's claims have had a far more critical reception from scholars specialising in magic and witchcraft in British history. In 1975, Eric Maple dismissed Lugh's claims as preposterous. He believed that such tales had been fabricated by someone who had used his own book, ''The Dark World of Witches'', as a basis.{{sfn|Baker|1996|p=186}} Maple informed the historian James W. Baker that he believed people connected to Valiente were behind the Lugh claims, although Baker disagreed, commenting that Valiente was "one of the most honest of commentators on the subject" of contemporary witchcraft, and that as a result was unlikely to be involved in such duplicity.{{sfn|Baker|1996|p=186}} Baker described Liddell's account as "an extravagant hoax", with its claims constituting "a preposterous ahistorical muddle".{{sfn|Baker|1996|p=185}}

Historian Ronald Hutton also scrutinised Liddell's claims, although added that he had corresponded with Liddell "at length and in detail",{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=290}} over the course of which he had come to like him, noting that "he has responded to often forceful criticisms with patience, modesty, and good humour".{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=298}} However, Hutton highlighted that no independent witnesses have emerged to support the existence of Liddell's alleged informants, while no supporting documentation has appeared to back any of his many claims. Hutton deemed this particularly unusual, because were Liddell's claims to have been accurate, much documentary evidence could be expected to exist.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|pp=294–295}} Focusing on Liddell's claim that Crowley had been initiated into one of Pickingill's covens during the 1890s, Hutton noted that there is no mention of Pickingill or a witches' coven in either Crowley's published work or personal diaries, and that similarly there was no mention of either in the diaries of Bennett, who was Crowley's magical tutor during the 1890s.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|pp=220–221}}

Hutton's assessment was shared by historian [[Owen Davies (historian)|Owen Davies]]; in his study of English cunning-folk, he described Liddell's stories as "seductive but entirely unsubstantiated". Instead, he maintained that Pickingill was "a simple rural cunning-man whose small world of village affairs never crossed with that of middle-class occultists. He received a Christian burial and the idea that he was a pagan priest would probably make him turn in his grave."{{sfn|Davies|2003|p=194}} While agreeing with Maple's assessment that Pickingill was "one of the last practising cunning-folk in the country", Maple noted that—unlike Murrell, [[James Tuckett]], [[John Wrightson]], and [[William Brewer (cunning man)|William Brewer]]—Pickingill was not a "major regional figure" in the profession.{{sfn|Davies|2003|p=193}}

American [[Pagan studies]] scholar [[Aidan A. Kelly]] similarly rejected Liddell's claims. Kelly highlighted that whereas Liddell had claimed that Gardnerian Wicca had adopted the concept of a female coven leader from French and Scandinavian witch covens, the historical evidence clearly showed that Gardner developed the concept of a coven being led by a high priestess during the late 1950s, thus disproving Liddell's assertions.{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1991|1pp=174–175|2a1=Kelly|2y=2007|2pp=275–276}} He noted that Liddell's claim that Crowley wrote Gardner's [[Book of Shadows]] "cannot possibly be true" because Crowley died before the Book was written.{{sfn|Kelly|1991|p=174}} Kelly believed that either Liddell or his Elders had purposely created a "phony history" in order to hide the fact that Gardner had invented Wicca in its entirety in the early 1950s.{{sfn|Kelly|2007|p=274}} Similarly, in a 2014 article about Pickingill in ''The Cauldron'', Richard Ward argued that Liddell's claims did not stand up under scrutiny, and that they had simply been made in an attempt to promote claims regarding the existence of a "pre-Gardnerian tradition" of witchcraft.{{sfn|Ward|2014a|p=21}} Liddell has specifically denied any charges that he was deliberately falsifying claims to make Gardnerian Wicca appear to have an older pedigree than it really has.{{sfn|Liddell|Howard|1994|p=18}}

[[File:Deutsches Musikarchiv der Deutschen Nationalbibliothek.jpg|thumb|Reading room of the German Music Archive in Leipzig]]
The '''German Music Archive''' (in German: '''Deutsches Musikarchiv''', ''DMA'') is the central collection of [[sheet music|printed]] and [[gramophone record|recorded music]] and the music-bibliographic information centre for [[Germany]]. It is a Federal agency founded in 1970, tasked with collecting all music published in the country. Publishers of printed and recorded music in Germany are required by law (since 1973) to deliver two copies of every edition as [[legal deposit]]s to the archive.

The DMA constitutes a department of the [[German National Library]] (''Deutsche Nationalbibliothek''). Since 2010 it is located in [[Leipzig]] at the national library.

== History ==
[[Image:Berlin musikarchiv.jpg|thumb|Former host building: The ''Siemens-Villa'' in Berlin-Lankwitz]]

The archive was founded in [[West Berlin]] on January 1, 1970, during the [[History of Germany (1945–90)|division of Germany]] as a department of [[Frankfurt am Main]] based ''Deutsche Bibliothek''—the national library for [[West Germany]]. It incorporated its precursor, the ''Deutsche Musik-Phonothek'' (1961–1969), and was located (until 2010) at the ''Siemens-Villa'' in [[Berlin-Lankwitz]].

In the process of [[German reunification]] the West German ''Deutsche Bibliothek'' and the East German ''Deutsche Bücherei'' formed one national library with two seats in Frankfurt and Leipzig. The DMA moved to Leipzig in 2010, to be housed in an extension of the ''Deutsche Nationalbibliothek''. Construction work began in 2006 and was completed in 2009.

In July 2000, the DMA also assumed the role as repository for [[GEMA (Germany)|GEMA]], ''Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte,'' a German music copyright organization. Since then, music publishers only have to submit copies to DMA, which covers both national archiving and copyright registration. The 210,000 works of printed music previously held by GEMA were transferred to DMA.

The '''Hall&amp;ndash;Carpenter Archives''', founded in 1982, are the largest source for the study of [[gay activism]] in Britain, following the publication of the [[Wolfenden Report]] in 1958. The archives are named after the authors [[Radclyffe Hall|Marguerite Radclyffe Hall]] (1880&amp;ndash;1943) and [[Edward Carpenter]] (1844&amp;ndash;1929). They are housed at the [[London School of Economics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|51.515|-0.116|display=inline|region:GB_scale:5000}}&lt;/ref&gt; at  [[Bishopsgate Institute#Bishopsgate Library|Bishopsgate Library]] &amp;ndash; (press cuttings),&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|51.518689|-0.079317|display=inline|region:GB_scale:10000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[British Library Sound Archive|British Library (Sound Archive)]] (oral history tapes).&lt;ref&gt;{{coord|51.530|-0.127|display=inline|region:GB_scale:10000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the archives==
[[File:Hall–Carpenter Archives at the Bishopsgate Institute.jpg|thumb|Part of the HCA book collection held at the Bishopsgate Institute library.]]
;1980
The Campaign for Homosexual Equality (CHE) established the ''Gay Monitoring &amp; Archive Project'' (GMAP) to collect evidence of discrimination and police arrests from all parts of the United Kingdom. It received agency press cuttings and collected other newspaper clippings sent in by its members.

GMAP later became separate from CHE and one its founders, Julian Meldrum, moved all the papers into his London flat. Its first funding was a grant made to the ''[[National Council for Civil Liberties]]'' (NCCL) from the ''Manpower Services Commission''.
;1982
Julian, with others, set up a limited company called the ''Hall&amp;ndash;Carpenter Memorial Archives Ltd'' and in 1983 registered as a charity. Trustees included Oliver Merrington (Chair of the archive) and Michael Mason, publisher of Capital Gay. The Albany Trust, donated its archives and press cuttings, and the NCCL provided essential meeting and working space in [[Southwark]], with financial assistance from the ''Lyndhurst Settlement''. It also received personal donations from members of the lesbian and gay community.

;1984
The archives moved to its first rented office accommodation in Mount Pleasant, London.

A major funding bid resulted in a grant of £32,000 from the [[Greater London Council]] (GLC). Part of this was to set up a Media Project to monitor television and radio broadcasts, and Lorraine Trenchard and Mark Finch were employed to run this. The archives moved to the new London Lesbian &amp; Gay Centre (LLGC) in [[Cowcross Street]], Farringdon (at that time the largest lesbian &amp; gay centre in Europe). Early publications included The Gay News Index (1982); ‘Declaring an Interest’ &amp;ndash; a projected catalogue of gay images on television in Britain, (1982&amp;ndash;83); and A.I.D.S. through the Media (1984). Work started on indexing the “News Library” of press cuttings, the records of gay organisations and a “Pink Thesaurus” was created by volunteers.

;1985
The archives employed Margot Farnham (until 1988) to coordinate a volunteer group for an Oral History project. Thirty-five interviews were carried out using new sound recording/transcribing equipment. The tapes and transcriptions are now in the [[British Library Sound Archive]], part of the British Library. The Oral History project culminated in two books "Inventing Ourselves" and "Walking After Midnight" (see References).

Around this time Kenneth Barrow had established the “National Lesbian &amp; Gay Survey” within HCA. This was a [[Mass-Observation]] style survey engaging the opinions of "ordinary" lesbians and gay men on various vital or controversial contemporary issues, anthologies from which were later published by Routledge.

;1986
The archives’ GLC funding terminated and the Lyndhurst Settlement helped with funding.
;1987
A fundraiser was employed who wrote to around thirty charitable trusts – but none replied favourably. It looked unlikely that the London Lesbian &amp; Gay Centre would receive funding and its closure was imminent, the Directors made a deliberate choice to try to house the Archives in a university, preferably in London.

;1988
Core collections, were moved to the Archives at the London School of Economics (LSE) with the active support of the Archivist, Angela Raspin. A number of gay activists, such as [[Peter Tatchell]] and [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search2?coll_id=3218&amp;inst_id=1 John Chesterman], donated personal collections. The HCA at LSE have continued to grow with new accessions, and have been extensively sorted and indexed by Sue Donnelly and other professional archivists in her team.
&lt;!-- got this far - temporary AVH marker --&gt;

;1989
The Hall&amp;ndash;Carpenter Archives Management Committee was in abeyance.
;1991
Oliver Merrington, one of the original Directors, took over as the Honorary Secretary/Treasurer, arranging meetings, dissolving the Limited Company, issuing occasional newsletters and drawing up formal agreements with the repositories. He arranged a regular donation of press cuttings from the monthly [[Gay Times]].

The Press Cuttings Collection proved much more difficult to house, as the LSE archive had a policy of not taking newspaper cuttings, the collection remained in the LLGC building in Cowcross Street, although the early cuttings relating to the start of the AIDS epidemic were moved to the Terence Higgins Trust. The cuttings then moved to [[SIGMA]] (an organisation conducting sexual research in relation to HIV) in [[Brixton]]. A professional archivist, Mark Collins, joined the volunteer team and started a re-sort of the cuttings collection which had not been touched for a decade. With his then partner Micheal Anthony Chan arranged their transfer in  1995 to the Greenwich Lesbian and Gay Centre, in South East London.
;1997
Simon Bradford, the librarian of the Cat Hill campus of Middlesex University was at this time creating a new Collections Room for a number of historical archives, and offered space to HCA.

In February the transfer was arranged and a formal ten-year loan agreement signed with Middlesex University. Oliver Merrington was appointed Honorary Research Archivist by the university, and held weekly volunteer sessions there to organise the cuttings.

;1998
On 2 June the collection was opened by a Member of Parliament, [[Evan Harris]] (standing in for [[Stephen Twigg]] MP). The photograph collection from [[Gay News]] is also at Cat Hill, as well as a growing collection of lapel badges, T-shirts, printed carrier bags and banners from marches and demonstrations.

;2001
The collection at Cat Hill was renamed The Lesbian and Gay Newsmedia Archive (LAGNA).&lt;ref&gt;Based on text by Oliver Merrington, published at the [http://www.lse.ac.uk/library/archive LSE website]&lt;/ref&gt;

;2011
LAGNA (press cuttings and book collection) moves to the [[Bishopsgate Institute#Bishopsgate Library|Bishopsgate Library]].

An '''index card''' (or '''system card''' in [[Australian English]]) consists of [[card stock]] (heavy [[paper]]) cut to a standard size, used for recording and storing small amounts of discrete data. A collection of such cards either serves as, or aids the creation of, an [[index (publishing)|index]] for expedited lookup of [[information]] (such as a [[library catalog]] or a [[back matter|back-of-the-book]] index). This system was invented by [[Carl Linnaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/06/090616080137.htm Carl Linnaeus Invented The Index Card] ScienceDaily, June 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; around 1760.&lt;ref&gt;Staffan Müller-Wille, Sara Scharf [http://www2.lse.ac.uk/economicHistory/pdf/FACTSPDF/3909MuellerWilleScharf.pdf Indexing Nature: Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) and his Fact-Gathering Strategies] University of Exeter &amp; University of Toronto, 2009, p. 4{{Dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everts"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Everts|first1=Sarah|title=Information Overload|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=26–33|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/information-overload|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common [[paper size|size]] for index cards in [[North America]] and [[UK]] is {{convert|3|by|5|in|mm|1}}, hence the common name '''3-by-5 card'''. Other sizes widely available include {{convert|4|by|6|in|mm|1}}, {{convert|5|by|8|in|mm|1}} and [[ISO 216#A series|ISO-size A7]] ({{convert|74|by|105|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Cards are available in blank, ruled and grid styles in a variety of colors. Special divider cards with protruding tabs and a variety of cases and trays to hold the cards are also sold by stationers and office product companies. They are part of standard stationery and office supplies all around the globe.

Index cards are used for a wide range of applications and environments: in the home to record and store recipes, shopping lists, contact information and other organizational data; in business to record presentation notes, project research and notes, and contact information; in schools as flash cards or other visual aids; and in academic research to hold data such as bibliographical citations or notes. Professional book indexers used index cards in the creation of book indexes until they were replaced by [[indexing software]] in the 1980s and 1990s. An often suggested organization method for bibliographical use is to use the smaller 3-inch by 5-inch cards to record the title and citation information of works cited, while using larger cards for recording quotes or other data. Index cards are used for many events and are helpful for planning.

Until the digitization of library catalogs, which began in the 1980s, the primary tool used to locate books was the [[card catalog]], in which every book was described on three cards, filed alphabetically under its title, author, and subject (if [[non-fiction]]). Similar catalogs were used by law firms and other entities to organize large quantities of stored documents. However, the adoption of standard cataloging protocols throughout nations with international agreements, along with the rise of the Internet and the conversion of cataloging systems to digital storage and retrieval, has made obsolescent the widespread use of index cards for cataloging.

==History==
The first early modern card index was designed by Thomas Harrison (ca 1640s). Harrison's manuscript on The Ark of Studies&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Harrison, The Ark of Studies. Ed. by Alberto Cevolini. Turnhout: Brepols, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; (Arca studiorum) was edited and improved by [[Vincent Placcius]] in his well-known handbook on excerpting methods (De arte excerpendi, 1689).
Using cards to create an index was the brainchild of 18th-century naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]], who is known as "the father of modern taxonomy" for his work on categorizing species. For organizing data, he needed a system for that was expandable and able to be rearranged easily; so he kept each datum on an individual sheet, and could add new sheets and reorganize simply.

Card catalogs as currently known arose in the 19th century, and [[Melvil Dewey]] standardized the index cards used in library card catalogs in the 1870s.

In the late 1890s, [[Edge-notched card|edge-notched]] cards were invented, which allowed for easy sorting of data by means of a needle-like tool. These edge-notched cards were phased out in the 1980s in favor of computer databases, and they are no longer sold.

[[File:Old kardex file cabinet.jpg|thumb|Kardex index card filing system]]
James Rand, Sr.'s Rand Ledger Company (founded 1898) with its Visible Ledger system, and his son [[James Rand, Jr.]]'s [[Kardex|American Kardex]] dominated sales of index card filing systems worldwide through much of the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1097">'''''[[The Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa|Institute for Democracy in South Africa]] v African National Congress''''' is an important case in South African administrative and constitutional law, concerning the right of access to information. The applicants sought access to the donation records of certain political parties, but the latter were judged to be private bodies in relation to those records. Section 8(1) of the Promotion of Access to Information Act&lt;ref&gt;Act 2 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; (PAIA) recognises that a body may be "public" or "private" for the purposes of the Act depending on whether the record in question "relates to the exercise of a power or the performance of a function as a public body or as a private body."

'''Johann Georg Holtzhey''' (1729, [[Amsterdam]] &amp;ndash; 1808, [[Amsterdam]]), was an 18th-century Dutch medallist and mint master.

==Biography==
According to the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) he was the son of [[Martin Holtzhey]], master of the mint in [[Gelderland]] and [[Middelburg]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/370090 Johann Georg Holtzhey] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt; He took over his father's workshop in Amsterdam in 1749 when his father accepted his duties as "muntmeester" (mint master).&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; He became mint master of the Utrecht mint, and became the teacher of the medallists David van der Kellen and Hendrik Lageman.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

==Work for Dutch honorary societies: Teylers Stichting==
He made a name for himself designing and striking medals for Dutch honorary societies, and kept the presses for these societies, striking medals on request and engraving the names of the prize winners himself. On his death the presses were often purchased back at great expense by the societies. The [[Teylers Stichting]] (English: Teylers Foundation) had him design a prize medal in 1778 that is still used. At 1000 guilders the manufacture of the coin stamps was costly -a consequence of the size of the medals, which matched the ambitions of the new Foundation.&lt;ref name=Teylers&gt;[http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio&amp;id=2&amp;nvlng=en website of Teylers Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525173049/http://www.teylersmuseum.eu/teylersuniversum/index.php?m=narratio |date=2013-05-25 }} with Holtzhey's accounts for making the prize medals for Teylers Theological Society and Teylers Second Society&lt;/ref&gt; Another receipt in the archive of Teylers Stichting testifies to the great care Holtzhey took when sending the medals, which were ''securely packed in wool to protect them from shaking''.&lt;ref name=Teylers/&gt; After Holtzhey's death the Foundation purchased the stamp press for the Teylers prize medal from the Holtzhey estate for 100 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;Akte 391 van 6 september 1808, bij notaris E.C. Bondt, [[Amsterdam Archives]], p. 8,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work for John Adams==
In 1782 Holtzhey designed two medals for [[John Adams]], one to celebrate the Dutch acknowledgement of the independence of the [[Thirteen colonies]] on April 19, 1782, and one to celebrate the trade treaty with the Netherlands on October 8, 1782.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/aea/cfm/doc.cfm?id=L17830520ja&amp;numrecs=6&amp;archive=all&amp;hi=on&amp;mode=&amp;query=medal&amp;queryid=&amp;rec=5&amp;start=1&amp;tag=text#firstmatch  Letter from John Adams to Abigail Adams, 20 May 1783], Adams Family Papers: An Electronic Archive. [[Massachusetts Historical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The face of the medal celebrating independence is in the collection of the [[Teylers Museum]] and declares “Libera Soror,” or “A Free Sister,” and depicts the [[Netherlands Maiden]] on the left as an armed woman and the United States on the right as a Native American woman. Holland uses a staff to place a [[Phrygian cap]] upon America's head, while America holds a shield bearing thirteen stars and rests a foot upon the head of a chained lion (representing England). The reverse shows the unicorn of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]], prostrate with its horn broken against a rock cliff. The inscription reads, “Tyrannis virtute repulsa / sub Galliae auspiciis,” which translates to “Tyranny repelled by valor / under the auspices of France”,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Wyllys Betts, American Colonial History Illustrated by Contemporary Medals, New York, 1894, p. 290–291&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Adams wrote ironically to his wife Abigail of the Dutch love for medals as a method of celebrating events, he wrote very respectfully to Holtzhey himself and thanked him for his work and explanation of the designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masshist.org/publications/apde/portia.php?&amp;id=PJA13fd10 |title=Letter correspondence between John Adams and Jean George Holtzhey on Massachusetts Historical Society website |publisher=Masshist.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Together with his father Holtzhey wrote a catalog of 73 historical medals in 1755, ''Catalogus der Medailles en Gedenkpenningen, betrekking hebbende op de voornaamste historien der vereenigde Nederlanden, Amst. 1755'', which was sadly far from complete, though it was quoted in several books on medals.&lt;ref name=Aa&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/aa__001biog10_01/aa__001biog10_01_0378.php Joan George Holtzhey] in a biography by [[A.J. van der Aa]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though he married twice he remained childless, and he was succeeded as mint master in Utrecht by his pupil [[David van der Kellen Sr.]], who continued his tradition of striking historical medals for anniversaries and popular events. In 1809 his collection was sold at auction for 4000 guilders.&lt;ref name=Aa/&gt;

The '''Kauri-butanol value ("Kb value")''' is an international, standardized measure of [[solvent]] power for a [[hydrocarbon]] solvent, and is governed by an [[ASTM International|ASTM]] standardized test, ASTM D1133.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM D1133 - 10 Standard Test Method for Kauri-Butanol Value of Hydrocarbon Solvents&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this test is a scaleless index, usually referred to as the "Kb value". A higher Kb value means the solvent is more aggressive or active in the ability to dissolve certain materials. Mild solvents have low scores in the tens and twenties; powerful solvents like chlorinated solvents and "High Sol 10" or "High Sol 15" (naphthenic aromatic solvents) have ratings that are in the low hundreds.

In terms of the test itself, the kauri-butanol value (Kb) of a chemical shows the maximum amount of the hydrocarbon that can be added to a solution of [[Agathis australis#Uses|kauri resin]] (a thick, gum-like material) in butyl alcohol without causing cloudiness. Since kauri resin is readily soluble in [[butyl alcohol]] but not in most hydrocarbon solvents, the resin solution will tolerate only a certain amount of dilution. "Stronger" solvents such as [[benzene]] can be added in a greater amount (and thus have a higher Kb value) than "weaker" solvents like mineral spirits.

'''Larry Hennig''' (born June 18, 1936) is an [[United States|American]] retired [[professional wrestler]]. He is the father of the late [[Curt Hennig|Curt "Mr. Perfect" Hennig]], and the grandfather of [[Curtis Axel|Joe "Curtis Axel" Hennig]] and [[Amy Hennig (wrestler)|Amy "Ms. Perfect" Hennig]]. He worked in the [[American Wrestling Association]], [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wide Wrestling Federation]], and is known by the nickname, "The Axe".  He was called the "Axe" because of his signature, often finishing move of dropping a full weight elbow onto his prone opponents.

==Professional wrestling career==
===American Wrestling Association===
In the early 1960s, Hennig entered the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) under the tutelage of [[Verne Gagne]].&lt;ref name=orlsen/&gt; He eventually found some main event success and shared a brief Tag Team Championship reign with [[Duke Hoffman]].&lt;ref name="Tag"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= Harley Race and Larry Hennig| pages= 65–67| year=2005| isbn=978-1-5502-2683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orlsen/&gt; But in frequently losing to rougher, more experienced wrestlers, he began questioning the scientific style instilled into him by Gagne and looked toward a different approach (in [[kayfabe]]).&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

During the summer of 1963, Hennig left the AWA for a stint in the [[Texas]] territories. While touring Texas, Hennig adopted a more brutal style and won the Texas Heavyweight Title. He also crossed paths with [[Harley Race]]. The two young wrestlers struck up a friendship and following their mutual commitment in [[Amarillo]], a new tag team broke out into the Minneapolis wrestling scene.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; Race and Hennig branded themselves as "Handsome" Harley Race and "Pretty Boy" Larry Hennig, a cocky [[heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] tag team with a penchant for breaking the rules to win matches.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; They quickly became top contenders, and on January 30, 1965, they defeated the tandem of [[Dick the Bruiser]] and [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]] to capture the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]], becoming, at the time, the youngest tag team champions ever.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;&lt;ref name=orlsen/&gt; Race and Hennig continued to feud with the Bruiser and Crusher and other top teams for the next several years, amassing three title reigns.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

Verne Gagne, in particular, was a hated rival of the team and recruited many different partners to try to defeat Race and Hennig during their AWA run. Gagne and Crusher won the titles from them six months after Race and Hennig's first reign but lost them back on August 7, 1965. The team retained the titles until May 1966 when they lost to Bruiser and Crusher.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; They then embarked on a tour through [[New Zealand]], [[Japan]], and [[Australia]] where they became the first Tag Team Champions of Australia's [[World Championship Wrestling (Australia)|World Championship Wrestling]] in June.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; Just before leaving to Japan, they dropped the titles to [[Mark Lewin]] and [[Dominic DeNucci]].&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

Race and Hennig returned to the US in fall of 1966, starting back at the bottom of the competition. As they climbed the ranks all over again, they  received a title shot on January 6, 1967 and defeated Bruiser and Crusher in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. This would prove to be their final reign at AWA Tag Team Champions.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

===Knee injury===
On November 1, 1967, during a tag team match in [[Winnipeg]], Hennig was in the middle of lifting [[Johnny Powers (wrestler)|Johnny Powers]] as another opponent rammed into him from the front.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; As he dropped Powers to the mat, Hennig found that his knee had bent inward.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; Despite severe damage to the [[cartilage]] and [[tendons]], he refused to go to the local hospital and instead had Race drive him 500 miles home to Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt; The injury ended their last title run. The AWA allowed Harley Race to select another partner to defend the championship.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt;

In March 1968, Hennig returned to once again wrestle alongside Race.&lt;ref name="Tag"/&gt; After several years at the top of the tag team division, however, Race left in December 1968 to pursue a singles career in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]]. Hennig was immediately partnered with [[Lawrence Heinemi|Lars Anderson]] for the next three years. In the mid-1970s, while competing in Florida, Hennig teamed for some matches with Race. 1972 had Hennig pair with "Dirty" Dusty Rhodes (then a heel), and in 1973, Larry worked as a singles star feuding with Verne Gagne and son Greg.

Hennig made a [[face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] on August 10, 1974 at a TV taping in [[Minneapolis]], now sporting a full red beard and calling himself "the Axe" when he saved the High Flyers, [[Jim Brunzell]] and [[Greg Gagne (wrestler)|Greg Gagne]], from an attack. The event had Hennig opposing his former allies, [[Nick Bockwinkel]] and [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]], and manager [[Bobby Heenan]] (who Bockwinkel and Stevens hired following their recent loss of the AWA World Tag Team title to [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]] and [[Billy Robinson]] the previous month) as they assaulted the Flyers during an episode of ''AWA All-Star Wrestling''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|publisher=WWE|title=Spectacular Legacy of the AWA|medium=DVD|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Hennig also appeared in the [[independent film]], ''[[The Wrestler (1974 film)|The Wrestler]]'', where he faced [[Verne Gagne]] at the [[Cow Palace]] in the opening match. In 1976, Hennig formed a team with [[Jos LeDuc|Joe LeDuc]].&lt;ref name=iron/&gt;

===Return to AWA===
When Harley Race returned to the AWA in 1984, he wrestled Hennig's son, [[Curt Hennig|Curt]] - a match that was fueled by Larry Hennig's confronting his former tag team partner at the end of the match. The following year, Curt's first major [[push (professional wrestling)|push]] would be alongside his father in a feud with [[The Road Warriors]]. Before Larry's retirement in 1985, however, the Hennigs won the [[NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship]].&lt;ref name=iron/&gt;

Hennig also traveled to [[New York City]] to unsuccessfully challenge [[Bruno Sammartino]] for his [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] title.&lt;ref name=slam/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:DominosLarryHennig.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Domino's Pizza]] in [[Newton, Iowa|Newton]] features Larry Hennig on July 15, 2006]]
Before pursuing a career in professional wrestling, Hennig became the Minnesota State High School Heavyweight Champion from [[Robbinsdale, Minnesota]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=iron/&gt; He was awarded a scholarship from the [[University of Minnesota]] to wrestle and play football but had to quit due to the priorities of family and raising children.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/12/07/1343031.html|title=Larry Hennig one tough guy|publisher=SLAM!

After the [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide|highly publicized death]] of [[Chris Benoit]] and his son, Hennig shared a few words with ''[[USA Today]]'' regarding premature deaths in professional wrestling.&lt;ref name=sequel/&gt;

Post-retirement, Hennig and his wife became owners of a real estate company in [[St. Cloud, Minnesota]]. He had sold real estate since 1957 and also worked as an auctioneer.&lt;ref name=orlsen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2000-06-02/entertainment/0006010354_1_american-wrestling-association-harley-race-wrestler|title=What Ever Happened To . . .

Indonesian author [[Chairil Anwar]] (1922–1949) wrote 75&amp;nbsp;[[poem]]s, 7&amp;nbsp;pieces of [[prose]], and 3&amp;nbsp;[[poetry collection]]s. He also translated 10&amp;nbsp;poems and 4&amp;nbsp;pieces of prose. The majority of Anwar's original poems are included in his collections: ''Deru Campur Debu'', ''Kerikil-Kerikil Tajam dan yang Terampas dan yang Putus'' (both 1949), and ''Tiga Menguak Takdir'' (1950). In 1956 documentarian [[HB Jassin]] compiled most of Anwar's remaining works as ''Chairil Anwar: Pelopor Angkatan 45'',{{sfn|Jassin|1968|pp=5–7}} and in 1970 [[Burton Raffel]] published English translations of Anwar's original works as ''The Complete Poetry and Prose of Chairil Anwar''.{{sfn|Raffel|1970|pp=vii–ix}}

Born in [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]], Anwar studied at schools run by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]] until around 1940, when he and his mother moved to the capital, Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]).{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|pp=202–203}} There he began immersing himself within the local literary scene.{{sfn|Yampolsky 2002, Chairil Anwar: Poet}} In 1942 he wrote "Nisan" ("Gravestone"), which is generally considered his first poem.{{sfn|Balfas|1976|p=78}} He wrote extensively during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] (1942–1945), at times having to change his poems to avoid censorship; for instance, the title of his best-known work, "[[Aku (poem)|Aku]]" ("Me"), was temporarily known as "Semangat" ("Spirit") to avoid censorship based on themes of individuality.{{sfn|Jassin|1968|p=163}} Anwar possessed a passionate individualism, and the line "I want to live another thousand years" from "Aku" is often quoted. As the years passed, this individualism developed into a feeling of mortality and surrender; ultimately it is difficult, if not impossible, to identify a single theme which unites all of Anwar's work.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|pp=204–206}} A notorious womaniser, he died at age 27; several sources suggest [[syphilis]] as the cause of his death.{{sfn|Djamin|LaJoubert|1972|p=52}}

After his death Anwar was criticised for [[plagiarism]], with several works revealed to have been uncredited translations of foreign poems.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=214}} His original works, unlike poems by earlier writers, used everyday language in an unusual manner in his poetry, mixing in words from foreign languages.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|pp=209–210}} Anwar's poems were also multi-interpretable.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|pp=204–206}} As such, the criticism of his plagiarism&amp;nbsp;– although extensive at the time of discovery&amp;nbsp;– has not affected his legacy. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature [[A. Teeuw]] described Anwar as "the perfect poet",{{efn|Original: "''... penyair yang sempurna.''"}}{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=199}} while Raffel describes him as "Indonesia's greatest literary figure".{{sfn|Raffel|1970|p=xxii}} The anniversary of his death, 28 April, is celebrated as National Poetry Day.{{sfn|Yampolsky 2002, Chairil Anwar: Poet}}

The following list is divided into five tables based on the type of works contained within. The tables are initially arranged alphabetically by title, although they are also sortable. Titles, originally in the [[Van Ophuijsen Spelling System|Van Ophuijsen]] and [[Republican Spelling System|Republican]] spelling systems, are here standardised with the [[EYD|Perfected Spelling System]] now in use in Indonesia. English translations of titles are provided underneath the original ones; Raffel's translations have been used for those in his book, while literal translations are provided for the titles of other works. Untitled works are recorded with their first words in parentheses. Years given are in the [[Gregorian calendar]]; works written between 1942 and 1945 generally used the [[Japanese calendar|Japanese ''kōki'' (皇紀) calendar]]. Unless otherwise noted, this list is based on the ones compiled by {{harvtxt|Jassin|1968|pp=163–172}} and {{harvtxt|Raffel|1970|pp=vii–ix}}.

The '''Lorillard Snuff Mill''' now known as the '''Lillian and Amy Goldman Stone Mill''', is the oldest existing [[tobacco]] manufacturing building in the United States.  It was built around 1840 next to the [[Bronx River]] to supplement an earlier building of the same function.  The [[schist]] that makes up its walls was quarried locally.  It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1977 and is located inside the [[New York Botanical Garden]], itself an NHL.&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Lorillard Snuff Mill|url={{NHLS url|id=77000935}} |format=pdf|author=George R.

The [[Lorillard Tobacco Company|Lorillard]] firm was founded by [[Pierre Abraham Lorillard]] in 1760.  His two sons, Peter and George, took over after he was killed during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and they moved the manufacturing portion of the business to this location in the Bronx in 1792.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv"/&gt;  Peter Lorillard III built a forty-five room mansion, stone cottage and stables nearby. The mansion burned in 1923. The Lorillard company and family left the property in the Bronx in 1870 after relocating their business to Jersey City, NJ.  The land was purchased by New York city in 1884 and was transferred to the [[New York Botanical Gardens]] in 1915. The Mill was retained by New York City Department of Parks and used for storage and shops until 1937 when it too was transferred to the Botanical Garden along with several other small parcels.  The Mill was renovated in 1952-54 and a cafe and patio were installed on the lower side facing the Bronx River, and a meeting room was fashioned from the space that once held snuff-grinding equipment.  The building had a $10.5 million restoration in 2010 and is now used for staff offices and a catering facility.&lt;ref name="Kirsch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirsch|first=Abigail|title=The Snuff Mill Gallery|url=http://www.abigailkirsch.com/exclusive-locations/the-new-york-botanical-garden-stone-mill/|publisher=Abigail Kirsch|accessdate=7 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517052048/http://www.abigailkirsch.com/exclusive-locations/the-new-york-botanical-garden-stone-mill/|archivedate=17 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt2009&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|title=From Tobacco Leaves to Wedding Bouquets, 169 Years in the Bronx|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/09/nyregion/09snuff.html|work=February 8, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1993">The '''Minton Archive''' is an important collection of records for the English pottery firm [[Mintons|Minton]].

The archive was originally housed in the firm's works at London Road, Stoke-on-Trent.  It was catalogued by Alyn Giles Jones (1928-2000), Archivist and Keeper of Manuscripts at the [[University of Wales, Bangor]], who acted as archival consultant for the Minton china company.

The archive includes work by designers who were employed by Minton, including [[Augustus Pugin]] and [[Christopher Dresser]].&lt;ref name="Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/Minton-Archive-Lifting-lid-centuries-life-pottery/story-28785172-detail/story.html | title=Minton Archive: Lifting the lid on centuries of life in pottery factories | work=[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]] | date=2016 | accessdate=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AF"/&gt;

The future of the archive was put at risk when, as a result of the contraction of the Staffordshire pottery industry, the Minton factory was demolished in 2002. Ownership of the archive passed to [[Waterford Wedgwood|Waterford Wedgwood plc]] which decided to auction it. Money was raised by the [[Art Fund]] and the archive was presented to the [[City of Stoke-on-Trent]] in 2015.&lt;ref name="AF"&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Minton Archive |url=https://www.artfund.org/news/2015/04/01/minton-archive-saved-for-the-nation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive is kept in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]],&lt;ref name="Sentinel"/&gt; where the documents are being digitised by the city's archive service (part of the Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent Archive Service). It is envisaged that some material will go on display at the [[Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] and the [[Wedgwood Museum]], Barlaston.

'''John Francis Walker''' (born September 10, 1934) is an American retired [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], better known by the [[ring name]] '''Mr. Wrestling II'''. He is best known for his appearances with [[Championship Wrestling from Florida]] and [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] in the 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="III2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris M.

== Professional wrestling career==

=== Early career (1956–1964) ===
Walker was trained by Tony Morelli and [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]]. He debuted in 1955 under the ring name Johnny Walker.&lt;ref name="III2003"/&gt;

After debuting as a wrestler, Walker spent a good portion of his early career (approximately from the late 1950s to the 1960s) as journeyman wrestler Johnny "Rubberman" Walker, a mainstay of [[Houston]] promoter [[Paul Boesch]].  Boesch gave him the nickname due to his flexibility.&lt;ref name="Mooneyham"/&gt;

Walker retired in 1964.&lt;ref name="Grasso2014"/&gt;

=== The Grappler (1967–1972) ===
Walker broke his retirement in 1967. In the early 1970s, Walker wrestled on the independent circuit in Florida under a [[wrestling mask|mask]] as "The Grappler".&lt;ref name="FunkWilliams2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terry Funk|author2=Scott E. Williams|author3=Mick Foley|title=Terry Funk: More Than Just Hardcore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZAmyUEP_v0C&amp;pg=PA80|year=2006|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn=978-1-59670-159-5|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mr. Wrestling II (1972–1989) ===
In 1972, Walker was semi-retired and running a gas station in Tennessee.  The Georgia promoter, Paul Jones, and his booker Leo Garibaldi asked for him to return to wrestling as the masked Mr. Wrestling II.&lt;ref name="Mooneyham"/&gt;  Introduced originally as the partner of the original [[Mr. Wrestling]] (Tim Woods), Walker would take his place in many instances.  [[Eddie Graham]], the owner of the [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|NWA Florida promotion]], was also a part owner of the Georgia promotion.  Graham was sending talent back and forth between the two promotions, due to the promotional war which occurred in Atlanta over a dispute with [[Ray Gunkel]]'s widow Ann Gunkel and her "outlaw promotion" All-South Wrestling Alliance.

Walker as Wrestling II became an immediate top draw and legend for the territory, leading to ten reigns as the Georgia Heavyweight Champion.  During Walker's time in Georgia as Wrestling II, he was considered one of the top five most popular wrestlers in the United States.&lt;ref name=WrestleHistory.com&gt;{{cite web|title=Masked in USA - Mr Wrestling II|url=http://www.wrestlehistory.com/2011/09/masked-in-usa-mr-wrestling-ii/|publisher=WrestleHistory.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111001109/http://www.wrestlehistory.com/2011/09/masked-in-usa-mr-wrestling-ii/|archivedate=2011-11-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also attracted a high-profile fan in [[Jimmy Carter]], at the time the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]]. ([[#Legacy|see below]])

While most of his career during the 1970s and 1980s was focused on the southeastern corner of the United States, he also made a prominent appearance in [[Mid-South Wrestling]] during 1983 and 1984 as the coach and mentor of a young wrestler named [[Magnum T.A.|Terry Allen]].  Vignettes aired on television, hosted by either Reisor Bowden or [[Jim Ross]], in which Wrestling II was shown away from the ring with T.A. discussing his philosophy in taking on a rising young star in the role of a "coach" or showing training sessions with the two.  As a tag team, they also won the promotion's [[Mid-South Tag Team Championship|tag team title]] from [[Butch Reed]] and [[Jim Neidhart]] on December 25, 1983.

Subtle seeds of resentment were planted along the way, which led to the pair splitting and feuding.  Wrestling II turned his back on T.A. in a tag team match against [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|The Midnight Express]], which saw T.A. bloodied.  On the following week's program, Wrestling II threw in the towel to cost T.A. the match while he was participating in the tournament for the promotion's television title, claiming that T.A. was too badly cut to continue.  Wrestling II had previously won the [[Mid-South North American Heavyweight Championship|North American Championship]] from the departing [[Junkyard Dog]], which T.A. won from him in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] on May 13, 1984.

Walker was later signed by [[Vince McMahon]] for the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1984, as part of McMahon's national expansion. However, as he was in the twilight of his career, Walker was mainly used as enhancement talent and rarely ever appeared on TV, only appearing a handful of times. He spent two years in the WWF before leaving in 1986.

=== Hawai'i Championship Wrestling ===
Mr. Wrestling II was the director of talent relations for Hawai'i Championship Wrestling. On October 13, 2007, he came out of retirement and won the [[HCW Kekaulike Heritage Tag Team Championship]] with [[Steve Corino|Mr. Wrestling 3]], II's protégé.

== Legacy ==
[[Jimmy Carter]], the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]] and later [[president of the United States]] during Wrestling II's 1970s heyday, considered him to be his favorite wrestler, as well as [[Lillian Gordy Carter|his mother's]] favorite.  Walker was invited to [[Inauguration of Jimmy Carter|Carter's inauguration]], but in the end declined the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Martin|first=Adam|title='Mr. Wrestling II' Johnny Walker Interview: Talks about his early career|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1169504607.shtml|publisher=WrestleView.com|date=2007-01-22|accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Secret Service]] insisted that Walker appear unmasked for security reasons.  Due to his popularity at the time under the mask, he couldn't justify the possible ramifications of his identity being exposed.  Wrestling II did, however, on several occasions enjoy a private audience with Lillian Carter.  He faced scrutiny from the Secret Service on these occasions as well, but they went off without incident.&lt;ref name="Mooneyham"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Walker had two children with his wife, Olivia. She was a [[seamstress]] and costume maker. Many of her clients were [[country music]] performers including [[Porter Wagoner]]. During an interview, [[Ric Flair]] stated that many of his robes were made by her. Olivia died in October 2000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== History ==

The developer of the Multitran [[software]] is Andrey Pominov, [[Moscow]].

Currently, Multitran is one of the largest and most popular web dictionaries in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;81st most visited site according to Alexa.[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/multitran.ru] The Russian [[Wiktionary]] has a better global rank, but lower rank in Russia, [http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/ru.wiktionary.org according to Alexa].&lt;/ref&gt;
Every day, over 90 thousand people visit ''Multitran.ru'', and over 1.5 million search requests are processed.

The Multitran base was created by scanning a wealth of paper dictionaries and combining all the translations in one database.&lt;ref name=sources&gt;http://www.multitran.ru/c/m.exe?a=146&lt;/ref&gt;

The website historically had a very low budget: according to Multitran's history page, a [[CPU]] paid only one dollar served over 4 million hits, and the site had issues with networking and electricity works around the webmaster's house in 2001 and 2002, as well as with growing traffic in 2002–3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.multitran.ru/c/m.exe?p=7&amp;a=5&amp;s=history/Multitran.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Multitran users arrange offline meetings from time to time, so called 'pow-wows'. Such pow-wows were held in Moscow, [[St. Petersburg]] and [[Kiev]].

==Copyright==

The Multitran software is proprietary and [[closed-source]].

The website content was copied from hundreds [[copyright]]ed sources, the majority of which were published after 1970.&lt;ref name=sources/&gt; It's not known how this can respect copyright laws: the website doesn't state whether a license was acquired from the copyright owners, nor whether the sources were determined to be in the [[public domain]].

Contributions by users are in unknown copyright status.

==Advantages and disadvantages of Multitran==

The huge volume of the base is both an advantage and a disadvantage because:

*Multitran may offer well over 100 translations for a word, which complicates the task of choosing the right equivalent for beginning language learners, though it comes very handy for language professionals.
*Search results often give duplicate translations of a term for various disciplines.
*Multitran may give very narrow meanings of a term, suitable only for very limited contexts.
*Multitran has a feature enabling users to check the equivalent translations, but checking each and every term may require dozens of man-years of work. Every registered user can issue a warning about identified mistakes, so until a mistake is corrected, it remains marked accordingly. Multitran users have reported about 8000 mistakes using this functionality, and most of them have been corrected. Thus, users not only add their own terms (added by users are more than 180 thousand words and phrases), but  also help to clean the database from mistakes.
*The feature allowing every registered user to contribute is an advantage, but it also carries the risk that mistranslations are added to the database, because they are added arbitrarily by Multitran users and depend on the level of the contributing individual user's knowledge, which may not be up to the mark.

The '''Musée de Cluny - Musée national du Moyen Âge''', formerly the '''Musée national du Moyen Âge''', or just the '''Musée de Cluny''' ({{IPA-fr|myze də klyni}}), or the '''Musée national du Moyen Âge &amp;ndash; Thermes et hôtel de Cluny''' ("National Museum of the Middle Ages &amp;ndash; Cluny thermal baths and mansion"), is a [[museum]] in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is located in the [[5th arrondissement of Paris|5th arrondissement]] at 6 Place Paul-Painlevé, south of the [[Boulevard Saint-Germain]], between the [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]] and the [[Rue Saint-Jacques (Paris)|Rue Saint-Jacques]].

Among the principal holdings of the museum are the six ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn]]'' (''La Dame à la licorne'') tapestries.

==The Hôtel de Cluny==
The structure  is perhaps the most outstanding example still extant of civic [[architecture]] in medieval Paris. It was formerly the town house (''[[hôtel]]'') of the [[Abbey of Cluny|abbots of Cluny]], started in 1334. The structure was rebuilt by [[Jacques d'Amboise (bishop)|Jacques d'Amboise]], abbot ''[[in commendam]]'' of Cluny 1485&amp;ndash;1510; it combines [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] elements. In 1843, it was made into a public museum, to hold relics of France's Gothic past preserved in the building by [[Alexandre du Sommerard]].

Though it no longer possesses anything originally connected with the abbey of Cluny, the ''hôtel'' was at first part of a larger Cluniac complex that also included a building (no longer standing) for a religious college in the [[Place de la Sorbonne]], just south of the present day Hôtel de Cluny along Boulevard Saint-Michel. Although originally intended for the use of the Cluny abbots, the residence was taken over by [[Jacques d'Amboise (bishop)|Jacques d'Amboise]], [[Bishop of Clermont]] and [[Abbot of Jumièges]], and rebuilt to its present form in the period of 1485-1500.&lt;ref&gt;Alistair Horne, ''Seven Ages of Paris'', 2004:62.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupants of the house over the years have included [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary Tudor]], the sister of [[Henry VIII of England]]. She resided here in 1515 after the death of her husband [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], whose successor, [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], kept her under surveillance, particularly to see if she was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.citibreak.com/the-cluny-museum-in-paris-a-trip-to-the-middle-ages/ Cluny Museum – A journey to the Middle Ages]"&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeenth-century occupants included several papal [[nuncio]]s, including [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]].&lt;ref&gt;Horne 2004:65.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the tower of the Hôtel de Cluny was used as an observatory by the astronomer [[Charles Messier]] who, in 1771, published his observations in the landmark [[Messier catalog]]. In 1789, the ''hôtel'' was confiscated by the state, and for the next three decades served several functions.  At one point, it was owned by a physician who used the magnificent [[Flamboyant]] chapel on the first floor as a dissection room.&lt;ref&gt;Michelin, pp. 265-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1833, Alexandre du Sommerard bought the Hôtel de Cluny and installed his large collection of medieval and Renaissance objects.&lt;ref&gt;''Album du Musée national du Moyen Age Thermes de Cluny'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon his death in 1842, the collection was purchased by the state; the building was opened as a museum in 1843, with Sommerard's son serving as its first curator. The present-day gardens, opened in 1971, include a "''forêt de la licorne''" inspired by the tapestries.

The Hôtel de Cluny is partially constructed on the remnants of the third century [[Gallo-Roman]] [[Thermae|baths]] (known as the [[Thermes de Cluny]]), famous in their own right, and which may be visited. In fact, the museum itself actually consists of two buildings: the ''[[frigidarium]]'' ("cooling room"), where the vestiges of the Thermes de Cluny are, and the Hôtel de Cluny itself, which houses its impressive collections.

==The museum==
The Musée de Cluny houses a variety of important medieval artifacts, in particular its [[tapestry]] collection, which includes the fifteenth-century [[tapestry cycle]] [[The Lady and the Unicorn|''La Dame à la Licorne'']].

Other notable works stored there include early medieval sculptures from the seventh and eighth centuries, and works of gold, ivory, antique furnishings, stained glass, and [[illuminated manuscripts]].

==References in literature==
[[Herman Melville]] visited Paris in 1849, and the Hôtel de Cluny evidently fired his imagination. The structure figures prominently in Chapter 41 of ''[[Moby-Dick]],'' when [[Ishmael]], probing [[Ahab]]'s "darker, deeper" motives, invokes the building as a symbol of man's noble but buried [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

In [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'', the narrator states (chapter 13) that the wealthy Dr. Renard's rooms "were like the Musée de Cluny".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1928">A '''NIC handle''' ('''Network Information Centre handle''') is a unique [[alphanumeric]] character sequence that represents an entry in the databases maintained by [[Network Information Centre]]s. When a new [[domain name]] is registered with a [[domain name registrar]], a NIC handle is assigned by the registrar to the particular set of information associated with that domain name (such as who registered it and a contact e-mail address). Once a domain name has been registered, its NIC handle can be used to search for that record in the [[database]].&lt;ref name="RFC954"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc954.txt
| title= RFC 954: NICNAME/WHOIS
| publisher=Network Information Center, SRI International
| accessdate= 2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="RFC1032"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1032.txt
| title= RFC 1032: DOMAIN ADMINISTRATORS GUIDE
| publisher=Network Information Center, SRI International
| accessdate= 2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NIC handle was developed in 1982 by Ken Harrenstien and Vic White working at the early Network Information Center at [[SRI International]].&lt;ref name="RFC812"&gt;{{cite web 
| url=https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0812.txt

| publisher=Network Information Center, SRI International 
| accessdate= 2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NIC handle system in limited modern use ==

The NIC Handle system is no longer commonly used by domain name registries.
It was previously possible to query [[WHOIS]] by NIC handle, and see all the domains registered by that NIC handle, but this service was discontinued (presumably due to [[Spam (electronic)|spam]]).

NIC Handles are still used extensively in the [http://www.ripe.net/db/index.html RIPE Database] to identify people and business roles.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a United States tax law case that discusses whether "special death benefits" paid to an employee's widow are exempt from taxes as a [[Gift tax in the United States|gift]] under §102(a).

It produces five factors as a pertinent test:

(1) whether the payments were made to the spouse of the deceased shareholder, not to his estate;

(2) whethor the payor had been under no obligation to make the payments and had, in fact, decided on previous occasions not to make payments to persons qualified;

(3) whether the company derived benefit of an economic nature from the payments;

(4) whether the recipient had ever performed any services for the company;

(5) whether the services of the deceased employee had been fully compensated during his lifetime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2090">In the fields of [[bibliography]] and [[bookselling]], '''prize books''' (also known as '''prize bindings'''), are a category of finely bound books once given as prizes and awards in educational institutions primarily in [[England]], [[Ireland]], and the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=John |date= September 1989|title=Reviewed Work: Gold-Tooled Bookbindings Commissioned by Trinity College, Dublin in the Eighteenth Century. (Studies in the History of Irish Bookbinding: 1) by Joseph McDonnell and Patrick Healy |url= |journal= The Burlington Magazine  |volume=131  |issue=1038  |pages=656–657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition flourished in Latin schools in continental [[Europe]] from the mid-17th century until the introduction of publishers bindings after about 1830. Books continued to be given as prizes at academic ceremonies, but the only distinguishing feature are typically special inscriptions and/or [[bookplates]].

==History in UK==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the tradition of special prize bindings persisted until the mid-20th century with the demise of traditional hand binding. Most titles consist of classical works in the [[humanities]] published in unbound print runs for this purpose. Schools would contract with a local [[bindery]] to prepare prize editions stamped or [[Paper embossing|embossed]] with the logo of the school. The editions are often made to resemble the fine bindings of the 18th century and are prized by booksellers for their classical appearance. They are often mistaken as ex-school library books but can be distinguished by a prize inscription, lack of [[call number]], and general higher quality of the binding.

'''RICE''' is a [[mnemonic]] for four elements of treatment for [[soft tissue injury|soft tissue injuries]] – an [[acronym]] for '''[[Relaxation technique|rest]]''', '''[[Cryotherapy#Ice pack therapy|ice]]''', '''[[Cold compression therapy|compression]]''' and '''[[Anatomical terms of motion#Elevation and depression|elevation]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/rehab/a/rice.htm |title=R.I.C.E - Best for Acute Injuries |accessdate=2007-08-15 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://med.umich.edu/1libr/sma/sma_rice_sma.htm |title=Sports Medicine Advisor 2005.4: RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation for Injuries |accessdate=2007-08-15 |work= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911021102/http://med.umich.edu/1libr/sma/sma_rice_sma.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MedicalMnemonics|235|||}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mnemonic was introduced by Gabe Mirkin in Sportsmedicine Book ({{ISBN|978-0316574365}}) in year 1978. However, he has since recanted his support for the regimen. On March 16, 2014, he wrote "Coaches have used my 'RICE' guideline for decades, but now it appears that both Ice and complete Rest may delay healing, instead of helping. In a recent study, athletes were told to exercise so intensely that they developed severe muscle damage that caused extensive muscle soreness. Although cooling delayed swelling, it did not hasten recovery from this muscle damage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drmirkin.com/fitness/why-ice-delays-recovery.html |title=Why Ice Delays Recovery |accessdate=2014-10-24  |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140629055909/http://drmirkin.com/fitness/why-ice-delays-recovery.html|archivedate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RICE is considered a [[first-aid]] treatment, rather than a cure for soft tissue injuries. The aim is to manage discomfort and internal bleeding.&lt;ref name="pmid17512485"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Järvinen TA, Järvinen TL, Kääriäinen M, etal |title=Muscle injuries: optimising recovery |journal=Best practice &amp; research. Clinical rheumatology |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=317–31 |year=2007 |pmid=17512485 |doi=10.1016/j.berh.2006.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence ==
There is not enough evidence from randomized controlled trials to determine the true effectiveness of RICE therapy for acute ankle sprains. Treatment decisions for ankle sprains must be made on an individual basis and relies on expert opinions and national guidelines.&lt;ref name="pmid22889660"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=van den Bekerom MP, Struijs PA, Blankevoort L, Welling L, van Dijk CN, Kerkhoffs GM|title=What is the evidence for rest, ice, compression, and elevation therapy in the treatment of ankle sprains in adults? |journal=Journal of Athletic Training |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=435–43 |year=2012 |pmid=22889660 |doi=10.4085/1062-6050-47.4.14 |pmc=3396304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary four terms ==

=== Rest ===
Rest is a key component of
repairing the body. Without rest, continual strain is placed on the affected area that is injured, leading to increased inflammation, pain, and possible further injury. Rest is recommended during the initial 24–48 hours after an injury, but after that modified activities can be started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://education.pthealth.ca/Injury-Care/R-I-C-E/a~1228/article.html|title=Physiotherapy|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some soft tissue injuries will take longer to heal without rest. There is also a risk of abnormal repair or chronic inflammation resulting from a failure to rest. In general, the period of rest should be long enough that the patient is able to use the affected limb with the majority of function restored and pain essentially gone. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Ice ===
Ice is excellent at reducing the inflammatory response and pain associated with heat generated by increased blood flow and/or blood loss.&lt;ref name="Sprains and strains"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprains and strains|url=http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/sprains-and-000157.htm|accessdate=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good method is apply ice for 20 minutes of each hour. Other recommendations are an alternation of ice and no-ice for 15–20 minutes each, for a 48-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/tw4354spec#tp21229 ''RICE: Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation for Injuries''] on the website of the [[University of Michigan]] Health System, retrieved 28 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent localised [[ischemia]] or [[frostbite]] to the skin, it is recommended that the ice be placed within a towel or other insulating material before wrapping around the area.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Exceeding the recommended time for ice application may be detrimental, as it has been shown to delay healing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Compression ===
Compression aims to reduce the [[edematous]] swelling that results from the inflammatory process. Although some swelling is inevitable, too much swelling results in significant loss of function, excessive pain and eventual slowing of blood flow through vessel restriction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

An [[elastic bandage]], rather than a firm plastic bandage (such as zinc-oxide tape) is required. Usage of a tight, non-elastic bandage will result in reduction of adequate blood flow, potentially causing [[ischemia]]. The fit should be snug so as to not move freely, but still allow expansion for when muscles contract and fill with blood.

Compression stockings or sleeves are a viable option to manage swelling of extremities with graduated compression (where the amount of compression decreases as the distance to the heart decreases). These garments are especially effective post-operatively and are used in virtually all hospitals to manage acute or chronic swelling, such as congestive heart failure.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Elevation ===
Elevation aims to reduce swelling by increasing venous return of blood to the systemic circulation. This will result in less [[edema]] which reduces pain and/or swelling.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Variations==
Variations of the acronym are sometimes used, to emphasize additional steps that should be taken. These include:
* "RICE" - Rest, Immobilize, Cold, Elevate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=American Red Cross |url=https://twitter.com/redcross/status/248782201485942785?lang=en |website=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
As the Cold or Ice component of RICE and its variations reduces blood flow to the injured area and delays healing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.consumerreports.org/health/avoid-ice-for-a-sprained-ankle/|title=Why You Should Avoid Ice for a Sprained Ankle|work=Consumer Reports|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; some people argue that for certain types of injuries (such as damage to ligaments and tendons) a protocol that increases blood flow, such as MEAT (Movement, Exercise, Analgesics and Treatments), should be used instead.&lt;ref name="Meat v.

'''The Shefton Museum of Greek Art and Archaeology''' was an [[archaeological]] museum at the [[University of Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]], which opened in 1956&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/shefton-museum/museum.html |title=About the Museum |publisher=Shefton Museum ([[Newcastle University]]) |accessdate=2008-04-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025005324/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/shefton-museum/museum.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and closed in 2008. Its collections are now part of the [[Great North Museum]].

== History ==
The museum was located in the Department of Classics in the [[Armstrong Building]] of the main University campus.  It was founded in 1956 by Professor Brian B. Shefton with a grant of £20 from the University's Rector, [[Charles Bosanquet (academic)|Charles Bosanquet]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt; Since then the collection has grown to over 800 objects.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;  Professor B.B. Shefton was the curator until 1984 when his role was taken over by Professor Tony Spawforth.&lt;ref name=about/&gt; Shefton died on 25 January 2012, aged 92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/9153928/Professor-Brian-Shefton.html |title=Professor Brian Shefton |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' |date=2012-03-09 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Great North Museum]] Project the Shefton collection, along with [[Museum of Antiquities]], was moved to the ''[[Hancock Museum|Great North Museum:Hancock]]''.  On 18 April 2008 the museum closed in preparation for the relocation of its collections to the newly renovated Hancock Museum, which opened in May 2009.&lt;ref name=last&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/press.release/content.phtml?ref=1208183792 |title=Last chance to visit University Museums |publisher=Newcastle University |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2008-04-24 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main| Denis Gifford}}
'''''The British Film Catalogue''''' is a reference book compiled by [[Denis Gifford]] (1927–2000) listing every film made in Britain, including feature films, shorts, information films and student films.  For each of more than 14,000 consecutively numbered chronological title entries, information listed includes major credits (director, producer, writer, original author), production company, distributor, actors and actresses, role names, running time, censors’ certificate, genre and a brief plot. It has an alphabetical index cross-referencing each title to its chronological number.

There existed no central register or other complete archive of films made in the UK, and Gifford sought to address this with the Catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Film Catalogue by Denis Gifford|url=http://www.britishpictures.com/books/catalogue.htm|work=www.britishpictures.com|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2000 edition of the work, written by Gifford but published shortly after his death, was a two-volume reference work, separating fiction (1895-1994) and non-fiction (1888-1994). The 1973 and 1986 editions were published as single volumes.

In order to compile the first edition of the work, Gifford spent twenty years meticulously searching through back copies of trade newspapers and tracking down directors who had retired years before.

The Catalogue was selected by the British Library's Curator of Moving Image as his choice in a ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' magazine shortlist of the best ever film books: "The nearest we have to a British national filmography was created not by any institute or university but by one man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McKernan|first=Luke|title=The best film books, by 51 critics|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/sight-sound-magazine/polls-surveys/film-book-poll/complete|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the work of other early film archivists and chroniclers, Gifford's work in relation to the Film Catalogue was praised by Leslie Halliwell in the 1976 introduction to the first edition of ''[[Halliwell's Film Guide]]'': "I salute especially the work of [[Leonard Maltin]], [[James Robert Parish]], Denis Gifford, Douglas Eames and the unsung anonymous heroes who compiled the reviews of the BFI's Monthly Film Bulletin during the fifties and sixties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halliwell|first=Leslie|title=Halliwell's Film Guide|year=1977|isbn=0-00-714412-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a highly respected reference source in film history, recommended by the [[British Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Library: Help for Researchers|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/refworks/film/filmref.html|work=Film: Reference sources: British Cinema|publisher=British Library|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yale University]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale University Library|url=http://guides.library.yale.edu/content.php?pid=9130&amp;sid=62802|work=Film Studies Research Guide: Selected Reference and Web Resources|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sciences and the Arts''''' is a 17th-century painting which is part of the collection of the [[Museo de Prado]] in Madrid.  It has traditionally been attributed to [[Adriaen van Stalbemt]], but more recently some art historians have re-attributed the work to [[Hieronymus Francken II|Hieronymus Francken the Younger]].&lt;ref name=sot&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/old-master-british-paintings-evening-l14033/lot.57.html Hieronymus Francken (II), ''A Collector's Cabinet''] at Sotheby's&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description and analysis ==
A scholarly group discusses around several tables, while a second group of people contemplate the paintings on the walls of the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/art-work/the-sciences-and-the-arts/3e32896b-42fb-4838-a677-9ecabcb23169|title=The Sciences and the Arts - The Collection - Museo Nacional del Prado|website=www.museodelprado.es|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At the center two characters looking at a chart representing the destruction of works of art by Protestants in the late sixteenth century. 
A wooden table in the right part of the image shows albums, maritime maps, compasses and a terrestrial globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/html_m/s/stalbemt/cabinet1.html|title=A Collector's Cabinet (detail) by STALBEMT, Adriaen van|website=www.wga.hu|access-date=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the interpretations of the painting is that is serves a propagandistic purpose for the rulers of the Southern Netherlands.  The painter's intention is to highlight the protection enjoyed by culture and the arts in the Spanish Netherlands under its Spanish rulers, while this protection is not available in the rebellious Protestant [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] in the North.

== A gallery painting ==
The painting falls in the genre of the gallery paintings.  Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings.  The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens.  [[Frans Francken the Younger]] and Jan Brueghel the Elder started the genre by creating paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s.&lt;ref name=merriam&gt;Susan Merriam, ''Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Some gallery paintings include portraits of the owners or collectors of the art objects or artists at work.&lt;ref name=marr&gt;Alexander Marr, 'The Flemish 'Pictures of Collections' Genre: An Overview', Intellectual History Review, 20: 1, (2010), p. 5 — 25&lt;/ref&gt;  The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, [[Cornelis de Baellieur]], [[Hans Jordaens]], [[David Teniers the Younger]], [[Gillis van Tilborch]] and [[Hieronymus Janssens]].
[[File:Hieronymus Francken (II) - A Collector's Cabinet.jpg|thumb|280px|A Collector's Cabinet, attributed to Hieronymus Francken II, at Sotheby's]]
A number of gallery paintings have traditionally been attributed to van Stalbemt.  This includes the composition ''[[:File:Stalbent-ciencias y artes-prado.jpg|The Sciences and the Arts]]'' discussed here and its reduced replica of the lower right hand corner called ''[[:File:Hieronymus Francken (II) or Adriaan van Stalbemt - The Geographer and the Naturalist.jpg|The Geographer and the Naturalist]]'' (also in the [[Prado]]).  ''[[:File:Hieronymus Francken (II) - A Collector's Cabinet.jpg|A Collector's Cabinet]]'', which is similar to the paintings in the Prado, was sold at [[Sotheby's]] on 9 July 2014 as lot 57.  Most art historians now appear to agree that these works should be attributed to [[Hieronymus Francken II]] as van Stalbemt's figures differ from those in these gallery paintings. The staffage in all of the gallery interiors is now seen as most probably the work of as yet unidentified figure painters.  Other gallery paintings that were formerly attributed to van Stalbemt have also been re-attributed to Hieronymus Francken II. Even so, some art historians still are of the view that van Stalbemt was also active in this genre.  For instance, some art historians still see the hand of van Stalbemt in one of the best known gallery pictures - ''[[:The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet (painting)|The Archdukes Albert and Isabella Visiting a Collector's Cabinet]]'' (collection of [[The Walters Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]).&lt;ref name=sot/&gt;

== Versions ==
There are five known versions of this composition. 
One in the [[Prado Museum]] in Madrid, another in the Galerie Kugel in Paris in 1988; the third was recorded in Hawkins Collection of London in 1951, a fourth version, the Galerie de Jonckheere in Paris in 2002 and the fifth at the Galerie Robert Finck in Brussels on 1955 (which was auctioned at Sotheby's on 9 July 2014 lot 57, as Hieronymus Francken II).&lt;ref name=sot/&gt;

'''''Trouser Press''''' was a [[rock and roll]] [[magazine]] started in New York in 1974 as a mimeographed [[fanzine]] by [[editing|editor]]/[[publisher]] Ira Robbins, fellow [[The Who|Who]] fan Dave Schulps and Karen Rose under the name "Trans-Oceanic Trouser Press" (a reference to a song by the [[Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] and an [[acronym]]ic play on the [[United Kingdom|British]] TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]])''. Publication of the magazine ceased in 1984; the unexpired portion of mail subscriptions was completed by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' sister publication ''Record'', which itself folded in 1985. ''Trouser Press'' has continued to exist in various formats.

==History==
The magazine's original scope was British [[band (music)|bands]] and artists (early issues featured the slogan "America's Only British Rock Magazine"). Initial issues contained occasional interviews with major artists like [[Brian Eno]] and [[Robert Fripp]] and extensive record reviews. After 14 issues, the title was shortened to simply ''Trouser Press'', and it gradually transformed into a professional magazine with color covers and advertising.

[[File:Trouser Press badge.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Trouser Press badge (button), circa 1982.]]
As the 1970s music scene transformed, so did the magazine's editorial focus. From 1976 on, ''Trouser Press'' frequently centered on the growing [[punk rock|punk]] movements in both [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]. The magazine provided in-depth articles on bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Boomtown Rats]], [[The Clash]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], the [[Ramones]], [[Television (band)|Television]], and many other similar groups, long before other U.S. music publications did. In 1980, the magazine introduced "America Underground", a recurring column devoted to local music scenes from different areas of the country. By the early 1980s, the magazine's focus was almost exclusively on [[New wave music|new wave]], [[alternative rock]], and [[underground rock]] from both sides of the Atlantic. Starting in 1982, [[flexi-disc]]s were included with every issue, totaling 27 releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://therecordchanger.blogspot.com/2011/11/trouser-press-flexi-discs-complete-list.html?spref=bl |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419155956/http://therecordchanger.blogspot.com/2011/11/trouser-press-flexi-discs-complete-list.html?spref=bl |archivedate=2015-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the magazine seemed to be thriving, with an ever-growing circulation, editor Robbins ceased publication after the April 1984 issue (#96), citing a lack of interest in the continuing but stagnating new wave scene that left his writers with very little to say.

==Aftermath==
As a concept, ''Trouser Press'' continued to evolve after the publication of the magazine ceased. In 1983, ''The Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records'', edited by Robbins, was published by [[Charles Scribner's Sons]].&lt;ref name="Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Ira A.|title=The Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records|year=1983|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]]|isbn=978-0684179438|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvZDAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was sufficiently popular for four more substantially updated editions, with varying titles and publishers, to be issued over the years, culminating in 1997's ''The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock''.&lt;ref name="Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock review"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robbins|first=Ira A.|title=The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-0684814377|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Onjb9IowkbsC&amp;q=The+Trouser+Press+Guide+To+90%27s+Rock&amp;dq=The+Trouser+Press+Guide+To+90%27s+Rock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6DnqTvv9B6Lq0gHO76DPCQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA|accessdate=15 December 2011|date=7 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This final edition featured all-new entries on over 2,000 bands and reviews of approximately 8,500 records and CDs. The contents of all five volumes are currently available on the ''Trouser Press'' website, which is updated with entries on new bands, as well as revisions/expansions of old articles, by Robbins and other writers. TrouserPress.com went online in August 2002.&lt;ref name="trouser"&gt;{{cite web | title=TrouserPress.com | publisher=Trouser Press | url=http://www.trouserpress.com/ | accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Odin og Völven by Frølich.jpg|thumb|300px|"[[Odin]] and the [[Völva]]" (1895) by [[Lorenz Frølich]]]]
'''''Völuspá''''' (Old Norse '''''Vǫluspá''''' or '''''Vǫluspǫ́''''', ''Prophecy of the [[Völva]] (Seeress)''; reconstructed Old Norse {{IPA-non|ˈwɔlʊˌspɒː|}}, Modern Icelandic {{IPA-is|ˈvœːlʏˌspauː|}}) is the first and best known poem of the [[Poetic Edda]]. It tells the story of the creation of the world and its [[Ragnarök|coming end]], related to the audience by a [[völva]] addressing [[Odin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heathengods.com/voluspa/index.htm|title=Voluspa at Temple of Our Heathen Gods|website=heathengods.com|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most important primary sources for the study of [[Norse mythology]]. Henry Adam Bellows proposed a 10th-century dating and authorship by a pagan Icelander with knowledge of Christianity. He also assumes the early hearers would have been very familiar with the "story" of the poem and not in need of an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem is preserved whole in the [[Codex Regius]] and [[Hauksbók]] manuscripts while parts of it are quoted in the [[Prose Edda]].

''Völuspá'' is found in the [[Codex Regius]] manuscript (ca. 1270) and in [[Haukr Erlendsson]]'s ''[[Hauksbók]]'' Codex (ca. 1334), and many of its stanzas are quoted or paraphrased in [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Prose Edda]] (composed ca. 1220, oldest extant manuscript dates from ca. 1300). The order and number of the stanzas varies in these sources. Some editors and translators have further rearranged the material. The Codex Regius version is usually taken as a base for editions.

==Synopsis==

The poem starts with the [[völva]] requesting silence from "the sons of [[Heimdallr]]" (human beings) and asking [[Odin]] whether he wants her to recite ancient lore. She says she remembers [[Jötunn|giants]] born in antiquity who reared her.

She then goes on to relate a [[creation myth]] and mentions [[Ymir]]; the world was empty until the sons of [[Borr|Burr]] lifted the earth out of the sea. The [[Æsir]] then established order in the cosmos by finding places for the sun, the moon and the stars, thereby starting the cycle of day and night. A golden age ensued where the Æsir had plenty of gold and happily constructed temples and made tools. But then three mighty giant maidens came from [[Jötunheimr]] and the golden age came to an end. The Æsir then created the [[Norse dwarf|dwarves]], of whom [[Mótsognir]] and [[Durinn]] are the mightiest.

At this point ten of the poem's stanzas are over and six stanzas ensue which contain names of dwarves. This section, sometimes called "'''Dvergatal'''" ("Catalogue of Dwarves"), is usually considered an interpolation and sometimes omitted by editors and translators.

After the "Dvergatal", the creation of the [[Ask and Embla|first man and woman]] are recounted and [[Yggdrasill]], the world-tree, is described. The seer recalls the burning of [[Gullveig]] that led to the first "folk" war, and what occurred in the struggle between the Æsir and [[Vanir]]. She then recalls the time Freyja was given to the giants, which is commonly interpreted as a reference to the myth of the giant builder, as told in [[Gylfaginning]] 42.

The seeress then reveals to [[Odin]] that she knows some of his own secrets, and that he sacrificed an eye in pursuit of knowledge. She tells him she knows [[Mímisbrunnr|where his eye is hidden]] and how he gave it up in exchange for knowledge. She asks him in several refrains if he understands, or if he would like to hear more.

In the Codex Regius version, the seeress goes on to describe the slaying of [[Baldr]], best and fairest of the gods and the enmity of [[Loki]], and of others. Then she prophesies the destruction of the gods where fire and flood overwhelm heaven and earth as the gods fight their final battles with their enemies. This is the "fate of the gods" - [[Ragnarök]]. She describes the summons to battle, the deaths of many of the gods and how Odin, himself, is slain by [[Fenrir]], the great wolf. [[Thor]], the god of thunder and sworn protector of the earth, faces [[Jörmungandr]], the world serpent, and wins but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterward before collapsing due to the serpent's venom. Víðarr faces Fenrir and kicks his jaw open before stabbing the wolf in the heart with his spear. The god [[Freyr]] fights the giant [[Surtr]], who wields a fiery sword that shines brighter than the sun, and Freyr falls. 
[[File:After Ragnarök by Doepler.jpg|thumb|The new world that rises after Ragnarök (depiction by [[Emil Doepler]])]]
Finally a beautiful reborn world will rise from the ashes of death and destruction where [[Baldr]] and [[Höðr]] will live again in a new world where the earth sprouts abundance without sowing seed. The surviving Æsir reunite with [[Hœnir]] and meet together at the field of [[Iðavöllr]], discussing Jörmungandr, great events of the past, and the runic alphabet. A final stanza describes the sudden appearance of [[Nidhogg]] the dragon, bearing corpses in his wings, before the seeress emerges from her trance.

==Theories==

''Völuspá'' is still one of the most discussed poems of the "Poetic Edda" and dates to the 10th century, the century before the [[Christianization of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;Den poetiska Eddan, övers. Björn Collinder (tryckt 1972) s.296&lt;/ref&gt; Most{{fact|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--Actually, the review cited as a source explicitly states that this view is *not* the usual one: 'Part III is perhaps the more original part of the book ... The idea that Völuspá is the product of a Christian tradition is not a new one, though it has not been the usual approach taken to the poem; instead, Völuspá is usually imagined as a great statement of heathen Norse ideas about the end of the world, which has little, if any, Christian influence.' While the reviewer agrees with the four essays, there is no source for the claim that *most* scholars have already embraced this opinion.--&gt; scholars agree that there are Christian influences on the text, some specifically pointing out parallels with the [[Sibylline Oracles|Sibylline Prophecies]].&lt;ref&gt;on Christian influences, see the following articles: "The Background and Scope of Vǫluspá" by Kees Samplonius, "Vǫluspá and the Sibylline Oracles with a Focus on the ‘Myth of the Future’" by Gro Steinsland, "Vǫluspá, the Tiburtine Sibyl, and the Apocalypse in the North" by Karl G. Johansson, and "Manifest and Latent Biblical Themes in Vǫluspá" by Pétur Pétursson, all articles in ''The Nordic Apocalypse: Approaches to Völuspa and Nordic Days of Judgement.'' Edited by Terry Gunnell  and Annette Lassen, eds. 2013. Brepols Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~jfr/review.php?id=1785 Online review touching on the Christian elements in Vǫluspá]&lt;/ref&gt; Bellows stated in 1936 that the author of ''Völuspá'' would have had knowledge of Christianity and infused it in his poem. Bellows dates the poem to the 10th century which was a transitional period between paganism and Christianity and both religions would have co-existed before Christianity was declared the official religion on Iceland and the old paganism was tolerated if practiced in private. This allowed the traditions to survive to an extent in Iceland unlike in mainland Scandinavia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have pointed out that there is religious [[syncretism]] in the text.

Some have suggested that the ''Dvergatal'' section and the part where the "Almighty who rules over all" are later insertions to the poem.&lt;ref&gt;Den poetiska Eddan, övers. Björn Collinder (tryckt 1972) s.296&lt;/ref&gt; Although some have identified "the Almighty" (a seemingly alien concept in Norse Mythology) with Jesus, Bellows thought this was not necessarily the case.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
