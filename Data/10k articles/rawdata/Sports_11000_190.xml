The '''1977 World's Strongest Man''' was the 1st edition of [[World's Strongest Man]] and was held at the [[Universal Studios]], [[California]]&lt;ref name="theworldsstrongestman.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldsstrongestman.com/1970s_results.php |title=theworldsstrongestman.com |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329010311/http://www.theworldsstrongestman.com/1970s_results.php |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and took place over ten weeks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Citation|last=HITstrongman|title=1977 World's Strongest Man|date=2014-06-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OA_aqIAg1s&amp;index=1&amp;t=423s&amp;list=PLUHF0SddZ9o1TE8eTPZRbut3_ZnWfJ_TD|accessdate=2017-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was won by [[Bruce Wilhelm]] from the United States. It was his first title. [[Bob Young (American football)|Bob Young]] from the United States finished second, and [[Ken Patera]] also from the United States third.

== Background ==
Originally commissioned by [[IMG (company)|Trans World International]] for [[CBS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2010|title=Testing for the World's Strongest Man|url=http://www.starkcenter.org/static/igh/articles/igh11.2.4.pdf|journal=Iron Game History|volume=11|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept for the World's Strongest Man event came from Scots [[David P. Webster]] and Douglas Edmunds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physicalculturestudy.com/2015/04/15/1977-and-the-birth-of-the-worlds-strongest-man/|title=1977 and the birth of the World’s Strongest Man|last=Heffernan|first=Conor|date=2015-04-15|website=Physical Culture Study|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster had earned himself a name as an event organiser through his involvement with the [[Highland games]], while Edmunds had experience in professional [[shot put]], [[Discus throw|discus]], and [[Caber toss|caber tossing]]. The event was mostly developed for entertainment purposes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://barbend.com/1977-worlds-strongest-man-greatest-thing-since-sliced-spam/|title=The 1977 World's Strongest Man Is the Greatest Thing Since Sliced SPAM - BarBend|last=Siem|first=Brooke|date=2016-07-06|newspaper=BarBend|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With no precedent for a worldwide 'Strongman' competition, the concept of a strongman competitor and event was new, and as such, the competitors came from a wide range of existing disciplines, including American football, powerlifting and track and field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This meant that none of the competitors had ever trained for the events taking place during the competition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition, several of the events in which the athletes competed were poorly thought out or dangerous, as evidenced when [[Italians|Italian]] [[Franco Columbu]] fell during the penultimate event, the Fridge Race, dislocating his knee, forcing him to retire and putting him out of action for three years.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theworldsstrongestman.com/the-worlds-strongest-man-classics-franco-columbus-tragic-fridge-race/|title=The Worlds Strongest Man Classics 1977 - Franco Columbu's tragic fridge race|date=2015-06-02|newspaper=World's Strongest Man|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fridge carry was not reintroduced to the competition until 2004, with a crossbar added to stabilise two fridges on either side of the athlete.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Final==
The Final was held at [[Partizan Stadium|Partizan's Stadium]] on May 15, 2007 in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. The final pitted Serbian powerhouse [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]] against the up-and-coming side [[FK Vojvodina]]. Vojvodina jumped out to the brighter start, with great attacking play from midfielder [[Milan Davidov]] running the show and wing-back [[Nikola Petković]] causing problems down the left.

Striker [[Ranko Despotović]] came close in the 10th minute after a darting run by Petković luckily for Red Star their veteran defender [[Dušan Basta]] foiled a flowing move with a last-gasp tackle with keeper [[Ivan Ranđelović]] beaten.

Red Star responded with a [[Nenad Milijaš]] free kick that almost crept in and [[Milan Purović]]`s close-range header before Koroman broke the deadlock on the hour with a crisp shot from the edge of the penalty box.

Vojvodina were on the back foot in the second half and failed to muster a single shot on target as Davidov faded and talented [[Montenegrins (citizens)|Montenegrin]] playmaker [[Igor Burzanović]] ran their defence ragged at the other end. [[Dušan Đokić]] sealed the win with a delightful 85th-minute lob after a defence-splitting pass from Burzanović.

"We couldn't break them down in the first half but our lads responded well after the halftime chat in the dressing room and we dedicate this victory to our fans," said Red Star's delighted coach [[Boško Djurovski]].

Koroman also praised the home section of the 25,000 crowd and said Red Star would now aim for success in Europe.

"Our fans were like an extra man on the pitch again and we want to treat them to some [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] football next season."

The '''qualification event''' of the '''[[2015 World Wheelchair Curling Championship]]''' was held from November 1 to 6, 2014 at the [[Lillehammer Curling Club]] in [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcurling.org/world-curling-federation-announce-hosts-for-2014-15-events|title=World Curling Federation announce hosts for 2014-15 events|date=4 April 2014|publisher=[[World Curling Federation]]|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwhcc2015.curlingevents.com/world-wheelchair-qualification-event-begins-november-1|title=World Wheelchair Curling Qualification event begins November 1|date=1 November 2014|publisher=[[World Curling Federation]]|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualification event was open to any [[World Curling Federation]] member nation not already qualified for the World Championship. The event's two top finishers, Norway and Germany, will join the top eight finishers from the last World Wheelchair Curling Championship at this season's event in Lohja, Finland.

This event would have marked the first appearance of Israel at an international wheelchair curling event, but Israel was deemed ineligible to play due to an inability to meet classification criteria.

'''Arm &amp; Hammer Park''', also known as '''Mercer County Waterfront Park''', is a venue located in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], [[New Jersey]]. It is the home [[baseball park]] for the [[Trenton Thunder]], a Double-A level [[Minor League Baseball]] team of the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]]. The official [[seating capacity]] is 6,150.

==History==
The park was built for the 1994 season, although it opened several weeks late due to a rough winter that hampered construction. The sod also was unable to take properly that season, and the field did not properly drain, leading to rainouts on evenings where the sun had been out since noon. The drainage problem was fixed in 1995.

The stadium's original name was "Mercer County Waterfront Park" when it opened in 1994. "Samuel J. Plumeri, Sr. Field" was added to the original name in 1999 by Trenton Thunder owner, [[Joe Plumeri]] (Chairman and CEO of [[Willis Group Holdings]]).  Samuel J. Plumeri, Sr. was Joe Plumeri's father. In November 2012, the New Jersey-based [[Arm &amp; Hammer (brand)|Arm &amp; Hammer]] purchased the ballpark's naming rights and will maintain its sponsorship through 2032.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mercer County Waterfront Park Baseball Venue to Be Renamed Arm &amp; Hammer Park|first=Emily|last=Brill|url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2012/11/mercer_county_waterfront_park.html|newspaper=[[The Times (Trenton)]]|date=November 14, 2012|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the park hosted the first-ever, gold– and bronze–medal games in baseball for the [[Special Olympics USA#2014 Games|Special Olympics USA National Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Olympics baseball games debut at Trenton Thunder ballpark|first=Benjamin|last=Teicher|date=June 19, 2014|publisher=[[Asbury Park Press]]|url=http://www.app.com/story/sports/2014/06/19/special-olympics-baseball-games-debut-trenton-thunder-ballpark/11005217/|accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Jersey Wins Special Olympics Gold At ARM &amp; HAMMER Park|date=June 20, 2014|publisher=[[Trenton Thunder]]|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140620&amp;content_id=80731854&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_t567&amp;sid=t567|accessdate=2014-06-21|quote=Team New Jersey captured the Gold Medal in the Special Olympics USA Games Inaugural Baseball Finals.

===Attendance records===
Arm &amp; Hammer Park set a record for game attendance on July 3, 2011, when the Thunder played the [[Altoona Curve]].  The game had the fortune of falling on the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] holiday weekend, as well as featuring an injury rehabilitation appearance by [[Derek Jeter]] of the [[New York Yankees]].  The official attendance for the game was 9,212.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jeter Finishes Rehab; Set to Rejoin Yankees|first=Dan|last=Tomasino|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/sports/yankees/captain_america_HqTEhedh2YHh9BYk1DTaOO|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|date=July 4, 2011|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Alex Rodriguez]] played two games on back-to-back nights in August 2013, the official attendance was reported at 8,080 and 8,113, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A-Rod Makes Strides As Rehab Stint Ends|first=David|last=Wilson|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130803&amp;content_id=55784728&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;c_id=nyy|publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media]]|date=August 3, 2013|accessdate=August 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
While the outfield in left and center field is covered with advertising signs that obscure views of [[New Jersey Route 29|Route 29]] and nearby houses, the right field fence was kept as a short structure so that fans could see the [[Delaware River]] and [[Pennsylvania]] beyond. The river is also an inviting target for left-handed sluggers, several of whom have deposited baseballs into the water. Similar to [[Great American Ball Park]] and its river border with [[Kentucky]], Arm &amp; Hammer Park also holds the possibility of having someone "hit one out of the state" since the middle of the Delaware River is the border with Pennsylvania.

On June 7, 1994, [[Tony Clark]] became the first player to hit a fair ball into the Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Frankllin|first1=Paul|title=Tony Clark was a huge hit with the Trenton Thunder|url=http://www.nj.com/times-sports/index.ssf/2013/04/tony_clark_was_a_huge_hit_with.html|accessdate=16 January 2018|work=NJ.com|date=April 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium anchors an area of rejuvenation in Trenton that also includes office buildings, nightclubs, and the [[CURE Insurance Arena]], several blocks away, for [[ice hockey]], [[basketball]] and [[arena football]].

The field is located behind Mackal Field House, the home venue of Rhode Island's men's and women's indoor track &amp; field teams.&lt;ref name=location&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill Beck Field |url=http://thingstodo.providencejournal.com/south_kingstown_ri/venues/show/1107925-bill-beck-field |work=ProvidenceJournal.com |accessdate=19 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68XQS7OJJ?url=http://thingstodo.providencejournal.com/south_kingstown_ri/venues/show/1107925-bill-beck-field |archivedate=2012-06-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovations==
In 2000, extensive renovations to the field began.  The playing surface was leveled and resodded, and a new sprinkler system was added.  In 2001, the field's [[Dugout (baseball)|dugout]]s were replaced.  In 2002, an electronic scoreboard was installed, two [[batting cage]]s were added down the right field line, and the field's fencing was replaced.&lt;ref name=2005mg /&gt;  Later, matching batting cages were added down the left field line.

In 2007, a [[USD|$]]1 million donation to the baseball program led to $1.4 million renovations on Bill Beck Field.  Completed in time for the 2009 season, a new backstop, scoreboard, fencing, and bullpens were constructed.  Also, a new [[FieldTurf]] surface was installed.&lt;ref name="facil" /&gt;

==Other uses==
In 2013, the field was used for the final game of the [[2013 America East Conference Baseball Tournament|America East Tournament]], after rain and scheduling conflicts forced [[America East Conference]] officials to move the game from its scheduled venue, [[Edward A. LeLacheur Park]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. In the game, [[Binghamton Bearcats baseball|Binghamton]] defeated [[Maine Black Bears baseball|Maine]], 4-0.&lt;ref name=aec13reasons&gt;{{cite web |title=Baseball Championship Game Postponed Until Sunday |url=http://www.bubearcats.com/index.php/news/show/baseball_and_maine_postponed_until_sunday |work=BUBearcats.com |publisher=Binghamton Sports Information |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J7gJo4iW?url=http://www.bubearcats.com/index.php/news/show/baseball_and_maine_postponed_until_sunday |archivedate=August 24, 2013 |date=May 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aec13score&gt;{{cite web |last=Jordan |first=Glenn |title=College Baseball: Maine Falls in America East Championship |url=http://www.onlinesentinel.com/sports/COLLEGE-BASEBALL-Maine-falls-in-America-East-championship.html |work=OnlineSentinel.com |publisher=Morning Sentinel |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6J7gOIjC5?url=http://www.onlinesentinel.com/sports/COLLEGE-BASEBALL-Maine-falls-in-America-East-championship.html |archivedate=August 24, 2013 |location=Waterville, ME, USA |date=May 26, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Court of Arbitration for Sport''' ('''CAS'''; {{lang-fr|Tribunal arbitral du sport}}, TAS) is an international [[quasi-judicial body]] established to settle disputes related to sport through [[arbitration]]. Its headquarters are in [[Lausanne]] (Switzerland) and its courts are located in [[New York City]], [[Sydney]] and [[Lausanne]]. Temporary courts are established in current [[Olympic host cities]].

==Jurisdiction and appeals==
Generally speaking, a dispute may be submitted to the CAS only if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties which specifies recourse to the CAS. However, according to rule 61 of the Olympic Charter, all disputes in connection with the Olympic Games can only be submitted to CAS,&lt;ref name="olympic1"&gt;[[International Olympic Committee]]: [http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf Olympic Charter]&lt;/ref&gt; and all Olympic [[List of international sport federations|International Federations]] (IF) have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for at least some disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. McLaren, [http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1482&amp;context=sportslaw Twenty-Five Years of the Court of Arbitration for Sport: A Look in the Rear-View Mirror, 20 Marq. Sports L. Rev. 305] (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through compliance with the 2009 [[World Anti-Doping Agency|World Anti-Doping Code]], all signatories, including all Olympic International Federations and [[National Olympic Committee]]s, have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for [[Doping in sport|anti-doping rule violations]].&lt;ref name="olympic1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[World Anti-Doping Agency]]: [http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/code_v2009_en.pdf 2009 World Anti-Doping Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824032644/http://www.wada-ama.org/rtecontent/document/code_v2009_En.pdf |date=24 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilary Findlay and Marcus F.

As a Swiss arbitration organization, decisions of the CAS can be appealed to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media20Release20FC20Sion.pdf Media release 23 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals of arbitration decisions are generally not successful,&lt;ref&gt;CAS Bulletin 2011/2 [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Bulletin202_2011.pdf Appeals against Arbitral Awards by the CAS] by Stephan Netzle&lt;/ref&gt; and no evaluation of the merits is taking place and the evaluation is mainly based on whether procedural requirements have been met, and whether the award is incompatible with [[public policy]]. {{As of|2012|3}} there have been seven successful appeals. Six of the upheld appeals were procedural in nature, and only once has the Federal Supreme Court overruled a CAS decision on the merits of the case. This was in the case of [[Matuzalém]], a Brazilian football player.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Levy: [http://www.probst-law.ch/bilder/The-International-Sports-Law-Journal-2012.pdf Swiss Federal Tribunal overrules CAS award in a landmark decision: FIFA vs Matuzalem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325190508/http://www.probst-law.ch/bilder/The-International-Sports-Law-Journal-2012.pdf |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] ruled against the German speed-skater [[Claudia Pechstein]], recognising a lack of jurisdiction to revisit her case. The Federal Court ruled that CAS met the requirements of a court of arbitration according to German law, and that CAS's independence from the parties was secured by the method of selecting arbitrators and the possibility to appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Keidel: [http://www.lawinsport.com/sports-law-news/item/german-federal-tribunal-rejects-claudia-pechstein-s-claim-for-damages-against-international-skating-union-isu German Federal Tribunal rejects Claudia Pechstein’s claim for damages against International Skating Union (ISU)] Accessed 17 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CAS hosted: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Pechstein___ISU_translation_ENG_final.pdf English translation of German Federal Tribunal decision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
With the intermixing of [[sports and politics]], the body was originally conceived by [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) president [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] to deal with disputes arising during the Olympics. It was established as part of the IOC in [[1984 in sports|1984]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 1992, the case of ''Gundel v. La Fédération Equestre Internationale'' was decided by the CAS, and then appealed to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], challenging CAS impartiality. The Swiss court ruled that the CAS was a true court of [[arbitration]] but drew attention to the numerous links between the CAS and the IOC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polyreg.ch/bgepub/Band_119_1993/BGE_119_II_271.html BGE 119 II 271] (Gundel v La Fédération Equestre Internationale)&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, the CAS underwent reforms to make itself more independent of the IOC, both organizationally and financially. The biggest change resulting from this reform was the creation of an "International Council of Arbitration for Sport" (ICAS) to look after the running and financing of the CAS, thereby taking the place of the IOC. {{As of|2004}}, most recent cases that were considered by the CAS dealt with transfer disputes within professional [[association football]] or with [[use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]].

The Court of Arbitration for Sport is planning to move its headquarters from the Château de Béthusy to the south part of the [[Palais de Beaulieu]] (both in [[Lausanne]]).&lt;ref&gt;Aïna Skjellaug, [http://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/05/18/prive-tour-taoua-beaulieu-presente-plan-b "Privé de sa tour Taoua, Beaulieu présente son plan B"], ''[[Le Temps]]'', Wednesday 18 May 2016 (page visited on 18 May 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisprudence examples of note==
===Doping===

* In March 2011, the CAS decided its first case on [[biological passport|athlete biological passports]] (ABP) when it suspended two Italian cyclists, [[Franco Pellizotti]] and [[Pietro Caucchioli]], for two years based on evidence from their blood profiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/sports/cycling/09cycling.html?_r=1 Court Upholds Cyclist's Ban Based on Biological Passport] ''New York Times''. Retrieved 24 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to that, the case of skater [[Claudia Pechstein]] had been decided (2009/A/1912 &amp; 1913) on similar grounds.&lt;ref name="tas-cas.org"&gt;CAS Bulletin 2011/2
[http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Bulletin202_2011.pdf The Athlete Biological Passport Program] by Despina Mavromati&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the 2011/2 CAS Bulletin regarding the institution of the ABP program, CAS Counsel Despina Mavromati differentiated between the two types of cases and wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is noteworthy that CAS had already issued an award suspending an athlete based on the longitudinal profiling of the biological markers before the adoption of the ABP by the IFs [international federations]: in CAS 2009/A/1912 &amp; 1913 [Pechstein], the Panel suspended an Olympic athlete after the biological data showed irregular blood values. According to CAS, those abnormal values were not caused by an error occurred in a laboratory, as the athlete asserted, but due to the banned manipulation of the athlete’s blood. The essential difference between ABP judgments and the CAS 2009/A/1912 &amp; 1913 consists in that in the latter case the athlete’s blood data was drawn from a sample the athlete gave at the federations championships and therefore not from data gathered by an official systematic program run by the athlete’s union.&lt;ref name="tas-cas.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In 2001, the court decided the case of [[Andreea Răducan]] versus [[International Olympic Committee]]. This was a controversial anti-doping case, where it was fairly clear the athlete received cold and flu tablets from her doctor. This resulted in a positive urine test, with the court concluding: "The Panel is aware of the impact its decision will have on a fine, young, elite athlete. It finds, in balancing the interests of Miss Raducan with the commitment of the Olympic Movement to drugfree sport, the Anti-Doping Code must be enforced without compromise.”&lt;ref&gt;''Essentials of Sport Law'', by Glenn M. Wong, Fourth Edition, Note 5.3.9&lt;/ref&gt;
* The court is reluctant to overturn [[Referee|field of play decisions]], though it may do so in cases where there is clear evidence that the officials acted in [[bad faith]] or with [[arbitrariness]].&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport:[http://www.centrostudisport.it/PDF/TAS_CAS_ULTIMO/105.pdf CAS 2012/A/2731 ''BOC &amp; BTC &amp; Márcio W. Ferreira v/ WTF &amp; COM &amp; FMT &amp; Damian A.Villa Valadez''] See §104 in particular.&lt;/ref&gt; In CAS 2010/A/2090, the CAS Panel explained that the reason for this is not a matter of jurisdiction, but of arbitral self-restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Aino-Kaisa Saarinen; Finnish Ski Association (FSA) vs Fédération Internationale de Ski (FIS) [http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/Shared%20Documents/2090.pdf CAS/2010/A/2090]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2011, in a case affecting the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], the court declared that a part of the [[Olympic Charter]] violated the World Anti-doping Code.&lt;ref&gt;USOC vs IOC [http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/Shared%20Documents/2422.pdf CAS/2011/O/2422]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Osaka rule" therein had prevented athletes suspended for at least six months for anti-doping rule violations from competing at the Olympic Games following the suspension's expiration. The court later re-affirmed this decision, when it struck down a long-standing by-law of the [[British Olympic Association]] (BOA) preventing the selection of athletes sanctioned for doping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/17853070 |title=London 2012: Dwain Chambers eligible after court ruling |work=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BOA vs WADA [http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/Shared%20Documents/2658.pdf CAS/2011/A/2658]&lt;/ref&gt; Both the IOC and BOA have responded by campaigning for adding a similar rule at the next update of the Code, which will be in effect by the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].{{By whom|date=July 2016}}
*In July 2016 the CAS confirmed that the [[Russian Olympic Committee]] (ROC) could not enter track and field athletes for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], with the exception of those cleared by the [[IAAF]] under the new competition rules regarding "neutral athletes". As the [[IOC]] was not a party to the case, the panel found it lacked jurisdiction to decide on whether the IOC could allow such cleared athletes to represent [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]], allow them to compete [[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics|independently]], or refuse their participation entirely.&lt;ref name="Russia athletics CAS press release"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release_4684_210716.pdf CAS rejects the claims/appeal of the Russian Olympic Committee and 68 Russian athletes] Accessed 25 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The claimants disputed the validity and enforceability of IAAF Competition rule 22.1(a), regarding the suspension of the national federation ([[All-Russia Athletic Federation|RusAF, formerly ARAF]]), and rule 22.1A, regarding the eligibility of athletes from suspended federations. The panel found that neither rule could be construed as sanctions, and for this and other reasons they were consistent with the World Anti-Doping Code. The panels commented on the futility of the challenge to the new rule 22.1A, noting that as the rule provided athletes from Russia a new route to participation a successful challenge would lead to the exclusion of athletes eligible under the rule, not the inclusion of other athletes. The panel decided against evaluating whether the principle of [[estoppel]] applies to sporting disputes, as it found the claims in this case would have failed.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sports: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Award_4684__internet_.pdf ROC ''et al.'' v. IAAF] Accessed 4 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, in a separate decision, the panel rejected the appeals of 67 Russian athletes against the decisions of the IAAF denying their applications to appear as "neutral athletes" at the 2016 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref name="Russia athletics CAS press release" /&gt; [[Darya Klishina]] was the only Russian athlete cleared by both the IAAF and the IOC, but the IAAF declared her ineligible on 12 August based on new information. On 15 August the CAS ad hoc court upheld Klishina's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release__English__Klishina_final.pdf Athletics: The application filed by Darya Klishina (Russia) is upheld by the CAS] Accessed 15 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia's sole athlete Darya Klishina cleared to compete after appeal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/15/russias-darya-klishina-to-compete-after-appeal|work=The Guardian|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) decided to ban [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Paralympics|Russia]] from the [[2016 Summer Paralympics]] due to the findings of the McLaren report. The appeal of the [[Russian Paralympic Committee]] (RPC) against the ban was dismissed by the CAS on 23 August. The court found that the suspension had a basis in the IPC rules, and stated that it "was proportionate in the circumstances". The panel noted that it had made no decision regarding the rights of individual athletes.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release_RPC_IPC.pdf CAS dismisses the appeal filed by the Russian Paralympic Committee] Accessed 23 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rio Paralympics 2016: Russia banned after losing appeal|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/disability-sport/37165427|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its reasoned decision the panel elaborated on this point, stating that adverse consequences for the athletes represented by the RPC was not a reason to absolve the organisation from its legal responsibilities. The panel dismissed the claim that the IOC decision should have influenced the IPC decision, noting that the organisations have separate charters and rules. As the IPC also acts as an IF the court referred to the case between the RWF and the IWF where the CAS upheld a similar suspension.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Award_4745_Final.pdf RPC v. IPC] (The sections referred to are from paragraph 79 onwards). Accessed 31 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In late 2017 the IOC disqualified a large number of Russian athletes' results from the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The athletes were also given life-time bans from future editions of the games. CAS registered 42 appeals, of which 39 were decided before the [[2018 Winter Olympics]]. For 28 athletes the panel found that the evidence presented by the IOC was not sufficient to establish rule violations. In the 11 remaining cases the disqualifications were upheld, but the ban was limited to the 2018 Games. The panel made clear that its mandate was limited to the individual cases. The case does not affect the status of [[Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Russian athletes]] participating in PyongChang.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release__decision_RUS_IOC_.pdf|title=The Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) issues its decision in the matter of 39 Russian athletes v/ the IOC|author=Court of Arbitration for Sports|date=1 February 2018|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/winter-olympics/42901377|title=Winter Olympics 2018: Court overturns life bans given to Russian athletes|publisher=BBC|date=1 February 2018|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IOC expressed its regret with the decision regarding the 28 athletes whose appeals were fully upheld, stating that the level of proof required was inconsistent with earlier CAS decisions. The IOC also stated that the sanctions being lifted was not a sufficient reason for inviting the 28 athletes to compete at the 2018 Games. The IOC said it would consider its options after receiving the reasoned decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-statement-on-cas-decision|title=IOC Statement on CAS decision|author=International Olympic Committee|date=1 February 2018|accessdate=1 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the ruling by the CAS, [[Jim Walden (lawyer)|Jim Walden]], the attorney representing [[Grigory Rodchenkov|Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov]], stated that the ruling made a "mockery"of the sanctions against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/democracy-post/wp/2018/02/05/in-the-latest-chapter-of-the-doping-scandal-russia-gets-a-pass/|title=Opinion {{!}} In the latest chapter of the doping scandal, Russia gets a pass|last=Walden|first=Jim|date=2018-02-05|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed to the CAS after FIFA reduced a suspension of Peruvian national team captain [[Paolo Guerrero]]. Guerrero had tested positive for cocaine after a World Cup qualifier against Argentina after ingesting a tea containing the substance. Guerrero was initially suspended for a total of 12 months, but this was later halved by FIFA's appeal committee. WADA in turn appealed to the CAS and they imposed the 14 month ban in May 2018 which will cause Guerrero to miss the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]. The CAS confirmed the existence of an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV), but also accepted that Guerrero was not trying to enhance his performance by ingesting the substance. The panel had considered that the player did bear some fault or negligence, even if it was not significant, and that he could have taken some measures to prevent him from committing the ADRV.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44115062&lt;/ref&gt;

====2016 Summer Olympics ad hoc court====

The ad hoc court for the 2016 Olympics had registered 18 cases by 3 August, surpassing the record two days before the Opening Ceremony. 11 of the cases were related to the various bans on Russian athletes related to the [[Doping in Russia#July 2016|allegations of state-sponsored doping]] documented in the [[McLaren Report|McLaren report]].&lt;ref name="3 August 2016"&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release__English__030816_final.pdf Media Release: 18 cases registered – Status as of 3 August 2016] Accessed 3 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the Games the total number of cases was 28, 16 of which were related to the eligibility of Russian athletes.&lt;ref name="CAS2016" /&gt;
*On 3 August the ad hoc court dismissed the appeal of the [[Russian Weightlifting Federation]] against its complete suspension under article 12.4 of the [[International Weightlifting Federation]] (IWF) anti-doping rules.&lt;ref name="3 August 2016" /&gt; The panel stated that the findings of the McLaren report constituted "conduct connected with or associated with doping", and found that the IWF had acted within its discretion when it decided that the RWF had brought the sport of weightlifting into disrepute. The panel noted that the re-analysis of doping tests from the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympics]] had found nine cases of Russian athletes testing positive for [[Turinabol]] and stated that this indicated a centralized doping programme. Furthermore, the panel commented that the positive tests for Turinabol were consistent with the evidence provided by Dr [[Grigory Rodchenkov]] for the report.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/REASONED_AWARD_OG_16-09.pdf CAS OG 16/09] Accessed 5 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
*A separate panel of the ad hoc court found that the [[International Rowing Federation]] (FISA) had correctly applied the eligibility criteria outlined in the IOC decision of 24 July when it denied the entry of 17 athletes.&lt;ref name="3 August 2016" /&gt; One of the criteria in the IOC decision was that the ROC could not enter athletes that had previously served a doping ban. The CAS panel deciding the case involving the rowers [[Anastasia Karabelshikova]] and [[Ivan Podshivalov]] found this criterion unenforceable, and ordered FISA to evaluate the athletes according to the remaining criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release__English__Karabelshikova_final.pdf Rowing: The Appeal of Anastasia Karabelshikova and Ivan Podshivalov is partially upheld by CAS] Accessed 4 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The panel referred to previous decisions on the "Osaka rule" and the BOA by-law. The panel compared the IOC decision with the IAAF decision on Russian athletes, and noted that the IOC, unlike the IAAF, had left athletes with a previous doping conviction without any path to participation, contravening principles of [[natural justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/final_award_CAS_OG_16-13.pdf CAS OG 16/13] Accessed 4 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The same conclusion was shortly thereafter reached in the case of swimmer [[Yulia Efimova]],&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/FINAL_AWARD_OG_16-04.pdf CAS OG 16/04] Accessed 9 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently competed and medalled at the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rio Olympics 2016: Russia's Yulia Efimova beaten to gold by Lilly King of USA|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36686211|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the cases of canoeists [[Natalia Podolskaya (canoeist)|Natalia Podolskaya]] and [[Alexander Dyachenko]] and  rower [[Ivan Balandin]] the panels dismissed the applications, upholding the part of the IOC decision of 24 July that removed the presumption of innocence from Russian athletes. Balandin challenged the legality of the IOC decision, while Podolskaya and Dyachenko only challenged its application. The panel in Balandin's case found no reason to annul the second paragraph of the IOC decision which, among other criteria, established that nobody implicated in the McLaren report was eligible for participation at the Games. The panel noted that while the decision establishes a presumption of guilt, this presumption is rebuttable by individual athletes. All three athletes were found to have benefitted from the "Disappearing Positive Methodology" described in the McLaren report and thus failed to meet the eligibility criteria of the IOC decision. The panels differed as to which [[standard of proof]] they required for the athletes' rebuttal of this presumption.&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Award__FINAL_.pdf CAS OG 16/12] Accessed 9 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Court of Arbitration for Sport: [http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/AWARD_16-19.pdf CAS OG 16/19] Accessed 9 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cases===

* In July 2015, in a case involving the issue of [[sex verification in sports]], the CAS issued an interim arbitral award suspending the regulations used by the IAAF to determine whether athletes with [[hyperandrogenism]] were eligible to compete in professional [[women's athletics]]. The regulations stated that athletes with testosterone levels above 10&amp;nbsp;nmol/L were not allowed to compete in the female category. The regulations were challenged by Indian sprinter [[Dutee Chand]]. The panel ordered the IAAF to file scientific evidence regarding the connection between athletic performance and elevated [[testosterone]] levels within two years of the issuance of the interim award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Court of Arbitration for Sport|title=CAS suspends IAAF Hyperandrogenism Regulations|url=http://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Media_Release_3759_FINAL.pdf|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Court of Arbitration for Sport|title=Chand v.

* The court ruled in 2006 that [[Gibraltar Football Association|Gibraltar]] had valid grounds for its application to join [[UEFA]], forcing the organisation to hand it provisional membership.

In May 2016 CAS partially upheld Gibraltar's appeal against a decision by [[FIFA]] denying membership.

* In 2010, the [[Irish Football Association | Irish Football Association (IFA)]] (the association of [[Northern Ireland]]) took its case to CAS after FIFA failed to prevent the [[Football Association of Ireland | Football Association of Ireland (FAI)]] (the association of the [[Republic of Ireland]]) from selecting Northern Irish-born players who had no blood link to the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/irish/8538702.stm IFA take case to CAS]&lt;/ref&gt; The CAS ruled in favour of the FAI and FIFA by confirming that they were correctly applying the regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CAS/2010/A/2071|title=Irish Football Association v/ Football Association of Ireland, Daniel Kearns and FIFA|url=http://jurisprudence.tas-cas.org/Shared%20Documents/2071.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue was originally called simply '''Max Ulrich Field'''.  After its 1953 construction, it was named after Max Ulrich, a San Francisco resident who donated in his will [[USD|$]]358,000 to the university.  The field took on its current name in 1980.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;  In that year, Dons baseball coach [[Dante Benedetti]] retired after 29 years in charge of the program.&lt;ref name=benedetti&gt;{{cite web|last=Perkins |first=Andrea |title=The Life and Times of Dante Benedetti: Baseball, Business, and a Babe Named Chubs |url=http://www.coastnews.com/sf/dante/dante.htm |work=Coast News |accessdate=27 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60Uqy6GYD?url=http://www.coastnews.com/sf/dante/dante.htm |archivedate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The diamond was dedicated to him that same year.&lt;ref name=hist /&gt;  Until [[Nino Giarratano]] surpassed him in 2012, Benedetti was the program's all-time winningest coach, with 373 wins.&lt;ref name=wins&gt;{{cite web|last=Sorenson |first=Eric |title=One of My Simple Pleasures in Life |url=http://blogs.eastonbaseball.com/collegebaseballtoday/2012/03/03/one-of-my-simple-pleasures-in-life/ |work=College Baseball Today |accessdate=4 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65uquexUg?url=http://blogs.eastonbaseball.com/collegebaseballtoday/2012/03/03/one-of-my-simple-pleasures-in-life/ |archivedate=2012-03-04 |date=3 March 2012 |quote=San Francisco’s Nino Giarratano picked up his 374th win in his Dons coaching career with today’s 6-5, 10-inning win over Cal State Northridge.

==Tenants==
===Current===
On January 13, 2015, the [[Plymouth Whalers]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] announced they would be relocated to Flint and will play at Perani Arena, with OHL approval.&lt;ref name="dtfp150113"/&gt;&lt;ref name="codt150114"/&gt; That team is now known as the [[Flint Firebirds]].&lt;ref name="fljo150316"/&gt;

In September 2015, the [[Detroit Waza]] of the [[Major Arena Soccer League]] announced their relocation to Flint. The team will operate as simply "[[Waza Flo]]" during the [[2015–16 Major Arena Soccer League season]].&lt;ref name="fljo150929"/&gt;

Local high schools and colleges use the arena for their commencement ceremonies.  Perani Arena is also usually the first stop for the [[Shrine Circus]] every year. The Perani Arena also holds the General RV Show every year.

===Former===
Previous tenants of the arena include the [[Flint Generals]] [[International Hockey League (1945-2001)|IHL]] hockey team from 1969 to 1985, the [[Flint Spirits]] hockey team from 1985 to 1990, the [[Flint Bulldogs]] hockey team from 1991 to 1993, the [[Flint Fuze]] [[basketball]] team from 2000 to 2001 and the Flint Flames [[indoor American football|indoor football]] team which only lasted the 2000 season.

'''Elbow pads''' are protective [[padding|padded]] gear worn on the [[Elbow-joint|elbow]]s to protect them against [[injury]] during a fall or a strike.

Elbow pads are worn by many athletes, especially [[Ice hockey|hockey players]], [[bicycling|cyclists]], [[roller skating|roller skaters]], [[skateboarding|skateboarders]], [[volleyball|volleyball players]], [[skiers]]  and [[Professional wrestler|wrestlers]].  Wrestlers sometimes use elbow pads as weapons by slapping their opponents, or take it off for an '''Atomic Elbow.'''

'''FIPFA''', the '''Fédération Internationale de Powerchair Football Association''', is the international governing body of [[powerchair football]]. It is headquartered in [[Paris]] in [[France]].

In 2006, representatives of 9 nations met in [[Coimbra]] in [[Portugal]] and then in [[Atlanta]] in the [[United States]] to develop a standardized set of laws for the game and to form and international governing body.

==Organization==
FIPFA is governed by an Executive Council with 10 members, each elected for 4 years. The President supervises the proposals put forth by commissions that work together for the development of the discipline throughout the world.   

FIPFA is organized similar to [[FIFA]], with several international zones. Currently, the only organized zone is the European Powerchair Football Association ([[EPFA]]), although the Powerchair Football Conference of the Americas (PFCA) is currently in the process of being organized. Eventually, the goal is to have zones for Asia and Africa as well.
==Rules==
The rules of the game are fairly simple like regular football (soccer.) The object of the game is to kick (using a specially designed wheelchair) the ball into the goal. There are three players on the field at the same time plus a goalie.

==Events==
{{main|World Powerchair Football Championships}}

==World Cup==
There are competitions every four years. The first World Cup competition was hosted in Japan in 2007, and was won by the US National Team. The US team successfully defended its title in Paris in 2011.  The most recent FIPFA World Cup was hosted in the USA in July 2017 and was won by France.

The '''Ford Idaho Center''' is a complex of sports and entertainment venues in [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], [[Idaho]], approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].

==About==
The Ford Idaho Center Arena is best known for [[rodeo]]. It annually hosts the [[Snake River Stampede Rodeo|Snake River Stampede]], considered one of the nation's top rodeos, during the third week in July. The Stampede moved indoors to the Ford Arena in 1997; it was formerly held in an outdoor stadium (now demolished) near Lakeview Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snakeriverstampede.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=208 Snake River Stampede.com] - history - accessed 2011-10-27&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR) has hosted a [[Built Ford Tough Series]] (originally Bud Light Cup) event at the Ford Idaho Center in what has been a major stop of the tour.

Ford Arena is used for concerts, trade shows, sporting events, and other events. It is the former home of the [[Idaho Stampede]], then of the [[Continental Basketball Association]] from 1997-2005 and the [[Idaho Stallions]] of the now defunct [[Indoor Professional Football League]] in their inaugural season of 1999.  
Ford Arena is the former home of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] Division II Men's Basketball Tournament. Upon its completion, the tournament moved to the Ford Idaho Center in 1998 from its former home on the campus of [[Northwest Nazarene University]].  The tournament moved in 2000 when NNU left the NAIA to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] in [[NCAA Division II|Division II]].

In March 2004, the Ford Idaho Center Arena was the home court for the [[Boise State Broncos|Boise State]] [[Boise State Broncos men's basketball|men's basketball team]] for a second round matchup in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] against the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee|UWM Panthers]]. The game was moved to the Ford Idaho Center due to a prior scheduled [[Metallica]] concert at Boise State's [[Taco Bell Arena]]. The game drew a crowd of 10,153, the largest for a basketball game in the arena's history. BSU and [[Idaho Vandals men's basketball|Idaho]] played a non-conference basketball game at the arena on December 31, 2011; the Broncos won 76-73 before 7,540 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espnnorthwest.com/article/2011/dec/31/turnovers-cost-vandals-loss-boise/ ESPN Northwest] - Turnovers cost Vandals in loss to Boise  - 2011-12-31&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Amphitheater has played host to music festivals, including the [[Vans Warped Tour]], the [[Gigantour]], [[Lilith Fair]], and the [[Mayhem Festival]].

[[Pearl Jam]] performed during their [[Binaural Tour]] on November 3, 2000, with [[Supergrass]] as their opening act. The show was filmed and later released as a live album, titled ''[[11/3/00 – Boise, Idaho]]''.

[[The Rolling Stones]] played their first concert in the state of Idaho at the arena during their [[A Bigger Bang Tour]] on Tuesday, November 14, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iorr.org/tour05/boise.htm io0rr.org/tour05/boise] - accessed 2011-10-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Idaho Center has been the Treasure Valley stop for the [[Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus]], [[Disney on Ice]] and [[Champions on Ice]] since it opened.

On January 14, 2014, the City of Nampa announced [[Ford]] as the new title sponsor for the Idaho Center. As part of the deal, Ford will pay the City of Nampa $1 million over five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvb.com/news/Ford-to-become-title-sponsore-for-Idaho-Center-240154321.html Ford to become title sponsor for Idaho Center] - accessed 2014-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, it was announced that the [[Idaho Horsemen]] indoor football team would begin play in 2019.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Ultimate Pro Wrestling (1999–2001) ===
Cena started training to become a professional wrestler in 1999 at [[Ultimate Pro Wrestling]]'s (UPW) California-based Ultimate University operated by [[Rick Bassman]]. Once he was placed into an in-ring role, Cena began using a semi-[[Cyborg|robotic]] character known as The Prototype.&lt;ref name="CenaHist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upw.com/features/cenahistory.htm|title=John Cena's WWE History|accessdate=July 4, 2007|publisher=UPW|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730205606/http://www.upw.com/features/cenahistory.htm|archivedate=July 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upw.com/uu/alumni.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401054209/http://www.upw.com/uu/alumni.htm|archivedate=April 1, 2007|title=Ultimate University/UPW alumni|accessdate=March 29, 2007|publisher=UPW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this period of his career was documented in the [[Discovery Channel]] program ''Inside Pro Wrestling School''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} He held the UPW Heavyweight Championship for 27 days in April 2000.&lt;ref name="UPWTitle"/&gt; Cena wrestled for the UPW until March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=691&amp;view=&amp;page=4&amp;gimmick=&amp;year=&amp;promotion=237&amp;region=&amp;location=&amp;arena=&amp;showtype=&amp;constellationType=&amp;worker=|title=John Cena's Ultimate Pro Wrestling matches|accessdate=January 16, 2016|publisher=Cagematch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE ===
==== Development and debut (2000–2002) ====
On October 10, 2000, while billed as The Prototype, Cena made his unofficial debut for the then [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) on a ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' taping in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] against Mikey Richardson, which he lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/00.htm|title=2000|publisher=Thehistoryofwwe.com|date=|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received another tryout on January 9, 2001, at a ''SmackDown'' taping in Oakland, California, this time defeating Aaron Aguilera. Cena wrestled again in a dark match at a ''SmackDown'' taping on March 13.

In 2001, Cena signed a developmental contract with the WWF and was assigned to its [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]] [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] (OVW).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} During his time there, Cena wrestled under the [[ring name]] The Prototype and held the [[OVW Heavyweight Championship]] for three months and the [[OVW Southern Tag Team Championship]] (with [[Rico Constantino]]) for two months.&lt;ref name="OVWTitle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ky/ovw/ovw-h.html|title=OVW Heavyweight Title|accessdate=April 12, 2007|publisher=Wrestling-Titles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OVWTT"/&gt; Throughout 2001, Cena would receive four tryouts for the WWF main roster, as he wrestled multiple [[Jobber (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]] wrestlers on both WWF [[house show]]s and in dark matches before WWF television events. Through the early months of 2002, Cena constantly found himself competing on house shows for the WWF, where he wrestled against the likes of [[Shelton Benjamin]] and [[Tommy Dreamer]].

After his main roster call up in June 2002, Cena would continue to appear on OVW programming until the September 25 taping of OVW, where he lost to Kenny Brolin in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|Loser Leaves OVW match]]. Cena would appear in a one-off appearance for the developmental farm in November under the ring name Mr. P in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Relevos Australianos|six-man tag team match]], where he teamed with future [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] and [[Charlie Haas]] in a winning effort against [[Lance Cade]], [[Trevor Murdoch]] and [[Sean O'Haire]].

On the June 24 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] ordered the entire roster to the ring and declared that he needed them to all find some ruthless aggression from within themselves and that he was looking for one of them to stand out from the rest of the pack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DKkC4ud2Tk|time=13:35|title=Vince McMahon Introduces The Ruthless Aggression Era Featuring Rob Van Dam|publisher=jenniifer eure|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cena made his WWE television debut on the June 27, 2002, episode of ''SmackDown'' by answering an open challenge by [[Kurt Angle]]. After declaring that he possessed "ruthless aggression", Cena lost by a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] combination.&lt;ref name=ship67&gt;Hamilton, Ian. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship'' (p. 67).&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Cena was congratulated by [[Billy Kidman]], [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]], [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]], and [[The Undertaker]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Following the near-win, Cena became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] and started [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuding]] with [[Chris Jericho]], defeating Jericho at [[Vengeance (2002)|Vengeance]].&lt;ref name=ship67/&gt; Then, Cena feuded with [[Los Guerreros]] ([[Chavo Guerrero Jr.|Chavo]] and [[Eddie Guerrero]]) and Cena picked up a victory over Chavo Guerrero on the September 3, 2002, taping of ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} On the September 12 episode of ''SmackDown'', Cena teamed with Edge in a losing effort against Los Guerreros, thus ending the feud in the process.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Cena went on to defeat the likes of [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and [[D-Von Dudley]] as he was restricted to appearances on ''Velocity'' for the rest of September.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In October 2002, Cena and [[Billy Kidman]] took part in a [[tag team]] tournament to crown the first [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Champions]] of the SmackDown [[WWE brand extension|brand]], losing in the first round.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The next week on ''SmackDown'', Cena [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turned on]] and attacked Kidman, blaming him for their loss, becoming a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villain]] for the first and only time in his career.&lt;ref name=ship67/&gt; On the October 17 episode of ''SmackDown'', Cena defeated Kidman in a singles contest,{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} but was defeated by Kidman in a rematch on the October 24 episode of ''SmackDown''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

====The Doctor of Thuganomics (2002–2005)====
Shortly after the Kidman attack on a [[Halloween]] themed episode of ''SmackDown'', Cena dressed as [[Vanilla Ice]] performing a [[freestyle rap]].&lt;ref name=ship67/&gt; The following week on ''SmackDown'', Cena received a new character: a [[rapper]] who [[Promo (professional wrestling)|cut promos]] while rhyming.&lt;ref name=ship67/&gt; As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] grew, Cena began adopting a variant of the 1980s WWF logo – dropping the "F" – as his "signature symbol", along with the slogan "[[Wiktionary:word#Interjection|Word]] Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wweozshop.com/show_products.php?p_id=65|title=John Cena's variant of the 80s WWF logo|accessdate=May 9, 2007|publisher=WWEOzShop.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513211628/http://www.wweozshop.com/show_products.php?p_id=65|archivedate=May 13, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[WWE Rebellion#2002|Rebellion]], Cena would team with [[Dawn Marie]] in a losing effort against Kidman and [[Torrie Wilson]] in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Mixed tag team match|mixed tag team match]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/02.htm|title=2002|work=The History of WWE|first=Graham|last=Cawthon|accessdate=May 24, 2015|date=October 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rebel.html#2002|title=Rebellion 2002|date=October 26, 2002|accessdate=May 24, 2015|publisher=Pro Wrestling History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Cena was joined by an [[Enforcer (professional wrestling)|enforcer]], [[Barry Buchanan|Bull Buchanan]], who was rechristened B-2 (also written B² and pronounced "B-Squared").{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} B-2 helped Cena kick off 2003 in victorious fashion with a win over Rikishi on the January 2 episode of ''SmackDown'' and a win over Chavo Guerrero on the January 9 episode of ''SmackDown''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Both Cena and B-2 participated in the [[Royal Rumble (2003)|2003 Royal Rumble]] [[Royal Rumble#Match|match]], but were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/rumble.html#2003|title=Royal Rumble Event Results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cena and B-2 failed to capture the WWE Tag Team Championship from Los Guerreros, resulting in Cena replacing B-2 with [[Rodney Begnaud|Red Dogg]] until he was sent to the Raw brand in February 2003.&lt;ref name=ship67/&gt;

For the first half of 2003, Cena sought the [[WWE Championship]] and chased the reigning champion [[Brock Lesnar]] after [[WrestleMania XIX]], gaining upset wins over Eddie Guerrero, The Undertaker and [[Chris Benoit]], who mocked him by wearing a "Toothless Aggression" shirt.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Cena won a number one contender's tournament for the right to face off against Lesnar for the WWE Championship at [[Backlash (2003)|Backlash]], but he failed to win the title at the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/backlash.html#2003|title=Backlash 2003 results|accessdate=May 9, 2007|publisher=Pro Wrestling history}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Backlash, Cena entered into a feud with [[Rhyno (wrestler)|Rhyno]] and Chris Benoit, which led to Cena, along with [[Chuck Palumbo]] and [[Johnny Stamboli]], defeating the team of [[Brian Kendrick|Spanky]], Rhyno and Benoit at [[Judgment Day (2003)|Judgment Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2003/results/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026052317/http://www.wwe.com/shows/judgmentday/history/judgmentday2003/results/|deadurl=yes|archivedate=October 26, 2006|title=Judgment Day 2003 Results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=February 8, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Cena began mocking The Undertaker before and after his matches leading to a match between the two at [[Vengeance (2003)|Vengeance]], where he lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Singles match|singles match]] against The Undertaker.&lt;ref name=ship67/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clevett|first=Jason|title=Angle takes Vengeance on Lesnar|url=http://www.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2003/07/28/147709.html|work=SLAM!

In a rematch between the two, Cena would once again defeat The Undertaker on the August 5 episode of ''SmackDown'', this time with assistance from [[Matt Bloom|A-Train]]. The feud between the two came to an end on the August 19 episode of ''SmackDown'', when Cena and A-Train defeated Undertaker and [[Orlando Jordan]] in a [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]].

==== Free agent (2017–present) ====
[[File:Cena March 2018.jpg|thumb|Cena in March 2018]]
In July 2017, WWE dubbed Cena a "free agent" during the [[2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]], meaning he would work for both the Raw and SmackDown brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/article/john-cena-free-agent-status?sf88580054=1|title=What does John Cena's Free Agent status mean?|date=June 14, 2017|last=Melok|first=Bobby|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return he quickly re-entered a feud with former rival Rusev, who Cena would challenge to a [[Professional wrestling match types|flag match]] with Rusev later accepting the challenge at [[Battleground (2017)|Battleground]], which Cena won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwebattleground/2017/john-cena-rusev|title=Cena and Rusev to go to war in a Flag Match|publisher=WWE|accessdate=July 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the August 1 episode of SmackDown Live, Cena faced [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] in the main event with the winner going on to face Jinder Mahal in the main event of SummerSlam with Mahal's WWE Championship on the line. Shinsuke would claim the upset victory over Cena with Cena giving Nakamura his seal of approval after the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keller|first=Wade|title=KELLER'S WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT 7/25: Surprise return, Owens gloats and Styles wants rematch, Nakamura vs. Corbin|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2017/07/25/kellers-wwe-smackdown-report-725-surprise-return-owens-gloats-styles-wants-rematch-nakamura-vs-corbin/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, Cena entered a feud with [[Baron Corbin]]. After defeating Jinder Mahal via disqualification on the August 15 episode of SmackDown, Corbin would attempt to cash-in his Money in the Bank briefcase but after interference from Cena, he was unsuccessful. This led to a match between Cena and Corbin at [[SummerSlam (2017)|SummerSlam]] which saw Cena walk away with the pinfall victory, thus ending the fued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Cena def.

Over the course of the rivalry, the duo were also forced to team together in consecutive tag team matches defeating the likes of Samoa Joe and The Miz (on the August 21 episode of RAW) and The Club (on the August 28 episode of RAW). At No Mercy, Reigns defeated Cena after kicking out of a 'Super AA' and delivering a single spear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benigno|first1=Anthony|title=Roman Reigns def.

From January until April 2018, Cena was involved in a storyline where he was trying to find his "path to WrestleMania". After he lost the [[Royal Rumble (2018)|Royal Rumble]] and the namesake Elimination Chamber match to determine the next number one contender for the [[WWE Universal Championship|Universal Championship]] at [[Elimination Chamber (2018)|Elimination Chamber]], as well as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|six-pack challenge]] at [[Fastlane (2018)|Fastlane]] for the WWE Championship, Cena issued a challenge to [[The Undertaker]] for a match at [[WrestleMania 34]]. He repeated his challenge over the next several weeks, only to receive no answer from Undertaker. On the March 19 episode of RAW, after calling out The Undertaker yet again, Cena was confronted and choke slammed by Undertaker's storyline brother Kane. This led to a no-disqualification match between the two a week later which Cena won. After the match, Cena called out The Undertaker again to no response. At WrestleMania 34, after Cena drove off [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]] in a confrontation, Undertaker returned and accepted Cena's challenge, leading to a shocked Cena losing to Undertaker in just a few minutes. Three weeks later, at the [[WWE Greatest Royal Rumble|Greatest Royal Rumble]], Cena defeated [[Triple H]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benigno|first1=Anthony|title=John Cena def.

He then went on hiatus to focus on his acting and television career.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On August 10, it was announced Cena would face [[Kevin Owens]] at [[WWE Super Show-Down]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. On August 20, the match was later changed to a tag team contest with Cena teaming with former rival [[Bobby Lashley]] to take on the team of Owens and Elias. On September 2, Cena debuted a new finishing move whilst teaming with Lashley and [[Finn Balor]] against Elias, Jinder Mahal and Baron Corbin at a live event in Shanghai. Having hyped the match on Twitter over the weeks leading to the event, Cena would declare he was set to unveil his 'sixth move of doom' - a reference to the criticism he has received for the perceived limitations in his move set - the move would end up being a variation of a lightning fist, which he used to pin Elias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The WWE Insider|title=John Cena DEBUTS New Finisher at WWE Live Event in Shanghai 'The Lightning Fist' (HD)|date=2018-09-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVYnYsvfn_k|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Super Show-Down, Cena and Lashley defeated Owens and Elias, with Cena once again using Lighting Fist as his finishing move.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} On the October 8 episode of ''Raw'', it was announced that Cena would represent Raw in the interbrand eight-man WWE World Cup Tournament at [[WWE Crown Jewel]]. On SmackDown 1000, Cena appeared via satellite where he reminisced on his debut, stating he regretted slapping Kurt Angle but never regretted starting out his career on SmackDown. A week later on ''RAW'', Angle evaluated his World Cup competition, including Cena. On the October 29 episode of ''Raw'', after Bobby Lashley would get himself disqualified in a singles contest against Finn Balor, acting General Manager, Baron Corbin, rewarded Lashley's display of dominance with a spot in the eight-man WWE World Cup Tournament at the expense of Cena who was the only superstar in the tournament who hadn't actually qualified. This was done as Cena had legitimately refused to work the event following the murder of Saudi Journalist [[Jamal Khashoggi]].

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
[[File:Cena FU Animated.gif|thumb|260px|Cena performing his finishing move, a [[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|fireman's carry takeover]] known as the ''Attitude Adjustment'' (formerly called the ''F-U'') on [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]]]
Cena's original [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] portrayed that of a white rapper who wore jerseys, backwards hats, and a chain with a padlock around his neck, was known as the "Doctor of Thuganomics". First as ''"The Prototype"'', and later under his real name, Cena sometimes used underhanded tactics to score victories, such as using his chain as a weapon behind the referee's back.&lt;ref name="news_John"&gt;{{Cite web | title = John Cena’s embarrassing beginning | author =  | work = NewsComAu | date = 11 April 2016 | accessdate = 2018-07-13 | url = https://www.news.com.au/sport/more-sports/john-cena-began-career-horribly-as-the-prototype/news-story/b89ddb936c5f1e5fb548c9bc05e1171d | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cena often rapped before his matches, insulting his opponents, events that happened in the media, and even the crowd. Cena also regularly performed "rap battles", where he and his opponent took turns rapping on each other. Cena reverted to this persona once during his feud with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]. In 2005, shortly after his first debut film, ''[[The Marine]]'', his wrestling character was shifted from a rapper to that of a young military upstart.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} After WWE's change from TV-14 to TV-PG in mid 2008, the name of his finishing move, the ''[[Professional wrestling throws#Fireman's carry takeover|F-U]]'', was changed to the ''Attitude Adjustment'' in order to fit with WWE's new policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/WWE/article1004487.shtml|title=

The moves typically go in the order as follows: flying shoulder block, sit-out hip toss, side-release spinout powerbomb, ''Five Knuckle Shuffle'' and ''Attitude Adjustment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/grantland-dictionary-pro-wrestling-edition/|title=Grantland Dictionary: Pro Wrestling Edition|first=David|last=Shoemaker|date=August 13, 2014|website=grantland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer of 2018, Cena hyped a sixth move. On September 1, Cena executed the move, known as the "Lightning Fist", a high-impact left handed jab to the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.solowrestling.com/new/73936-john-cena-regresa-a-la-accion-anadiendo-un-nuevo-movimiento-a-su-arsenal|title=John Cena regresa a la acción añadiendo un nuevo movimiento a su arsenal|first=|last=Solowrestling|date=September 3, 2018|website=solowrestling.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cena has portrayed a heroic character throughout his WWE career, with the exception of a villainous run in 2002–2003. Cena's signature ring gear includes jean shorts, sneakers, wristbands, and armbands. Cena also wears a variety of T-shirts and baseball caps, which commonly include one of his catchphrases such as "never give up", "you can't see me", "hustle, loyalty, respect" and "respect. Earn it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/gallery/john-cena-new-gear-photos#fid-40081561|title=John Cena's new gear: photos|work=[[WWE|WWE.com]]|accessdate=August 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cena has a history of returning from actual (and [[kayfabe]]) injuries much sooner than expected. In 2016, ESPN reporter David Shoemaker said, "Never underestimate Cena's recuperative abilities. He's somewhere on the recovery scale between German [[platelet-rich plasma]] therapy and [[Deadpool]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shoemaker|first=David|title=The highs and lows of a record-breaking WrestleMania 32|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/15132979/the-highs-lows-wrestlemania-32|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=April 5, 2016|accessdate=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big Show]] stated he felt the most stable to be lifted by Cena, despite Cena being over 200 lbs lighter and almost a foot shorter, a testament to Cena's [[Functional training|functional strength]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=WWE|title=Big Show reveals who WWE's strongest athletes are, on WWE Network's Table for 3|date=September 26, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIn7k__fhmY|accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion ===
During his WWE career, Cena's attire has attempted to reflect the most current fashions and stylings within the [[hip hop culture]] that his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]] represents. Cena started out wearing "[[Mitchell &amp; Ness|throwback jerseys]]" until WWE produced specific Cena merchandise which he began wearing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} While Cena was a member of the ''SmackDown'' brand, one of his WWE produced T-shirts bore the suggestive [[spoonerism]] "Ruck Fules". Whenever it appeared on television the image was censored, not by the network, but by WWE to sell more shirts under the premise that it was "too hot for TV".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/oo/20050126.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107015531/http://www.oowrestling.com/columns/oo/20050126.shtml|deadurl=yes|archivedate=January 7, 2009|title=RAW/Rating, SD! is CANCELLED~!, Plus: ECW PPV, Importance of Maturity, and More!|accessdate=February 12, 2007|publisher=Online Onslaught|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wore a chain with a large [[Lock (security device)|padlock]], occasionally using it as a [[Foreign object (professional wrestling)|weapon]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} until [[WrestleMania 21]], when it was replaced with a [[Bling-bling|chromed and diamond studded]] "Chain Gang" [[Spinner (wheel)|spinner]] medallion – reminiscent of the ones worn by members of [[G-Unit]] – matching his spinner title belt.

Around the time ''[[The Marine]]'' was released, Cena began wearing attire more military related, including [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] shorts, [[Dog tag (identifier)|dog tags]], a [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] soldier cap, and a WWE produced shirt with the legend "Chain Gang Assault Battalion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shopzone.wwe.com/product_detail.asp?productId=10-00492 |title=John Cena Studio Fathead |accessdate=October 8, 2007 |publisher=Shopzone.WWE.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113060457/http://shopzone.wwe.com/product_detail.asp?productId=10-00492 |archivedate=November 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after [[WrestleMania 23]], when promotion for ''The Marine'' ended, the military attire diminished and was replaced with apparel bearing his new slogan "American Made Muscle" along with denim shorts, not seen since he was a member of the ''SmackDown'' roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shopzone.wwe.com/product_detail.asp?productId=50-02544&amp;cartID=2007100721501321831024118 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113061101/http://shopzone.wwe.com/product_detail.asp?productId=50-02544&amp;cartID=2007100721501321831024118 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 13, 2007 |title=John Cena Youth American Made Muscle Package |accessdate=October 8, 2007 |publisher=Shopzone.WWE.com |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then wore shirts that promoted Cenation and his trademark line "You Can't See Me".

'''Mongolian National Olympic Committee''' ({{lang-mn|Монголын Үндэсний олимпийн хороо}}) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] representing [[Mongolia]].

==History==
The Mongolian National Olympic Committee was established on 2 February 26, 1956 and sanctioned by the MPRP Central Committee and the Council of Minister of the [[People's Republic of Mongolia|People's Republic]] of 2-joint 42/37 on April 26, 1956. It has since become an independent non-government organization in order to comply with the [[International Olympic Committee|International Olympic Games]] Charter and Rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.mn/ | publisher= National Olympic Committee of Mongolia |title=Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, national sports associations were established to promote development and participation by youth and adults. These then evolved to focus on participation in international sports. Mongolian athletes have been involved in regular games in Asia since 1972 and have participated in 13 [[Winter Olympic Games]] and 12 [[Summer Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.mn/ | publisher= National Olympic Committee of Mongolia |title=Leaflet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library==

The library contains books, magazine, and texts from ancient to modern times. Topics covered range from scientific reports, to sport and athlete histories. Over 10-thousand publications compose a rich library. As well, the Rings Newspaper is kept stocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.mn/ | publisher= National Olympic Committee of Mongolia |title=Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Park Hill Stakes''' is a [[Group races|Group 2]] [[Flat racing|flat]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] in Great Britain open to [[Filly|fillies]] and [[mare]]s aged three years or older. It is run at [[Doncaster Racecourse|Doncaster]] over a distance of 1 mile, 6 furlongs and 115 yards (2,922 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in September.

==History==
The event is named after Park Hill, an estate formerly owned by [[Anthony St Leger (British Army officer)|Anthony St. Leger]], the founder of Doncaster's most famous race, the [[St. Leger Stakes]]. The Park Hill Stakes was established in 1839, and it was originally restricted to three-year-old fillies.

The victory of [[Blink Bonny]] in 1857 provoked a riot among spectators who believed she had been dishonestly prevented from winning the previous day's St. Leger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Blink Bonny Disturbances | url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59868069 | publisher = [[National Library of Australia#Trove|Trove]] (Bell's Life in Sydney, 23 January 1858) | accessdate = 8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and the Park Hill Stakes was initially given Group 2 status. It was opened to fillies and mares aged four or older and relegated to Group 3 level in 1991. It was promoted back to Group 2 in 2004.

The Park Hill Stakes is currently held on the second day of Doncaster's four-day St. Leger Festival. It is sometimes referred to as the Fillies' St. Leger.

The '''Philadelphia Sphas''', also stylized '''SPHAs''' or '''SPHAS''', were an American basketball franchise that existed in professional, semi-professional, and exhibition forms. They played their home games in the ballroom of Philadelphia's Broadwood Hotel. The team's name is an [[acronym]], derived from '''S'''outh '''P'''hiladelphia '''H'''ebrew '''A'''ssociation (the group that initially funded the team), and the team's players, at least in its earlier years, were primarily Jewish. Future [[Philadelphia Warriors]] owner [[Eddie Gottlieb]] founded the team as an amateur group shortly after he and some close friends graduated from high school, and the team evolved into a professional unit that played in many leagues around the Philadelphia area and the East Coast, most notably the Eastern Basketball League and the [[American Basketball League (1925–55)|American Basketball League]], between which the Sphas won 10 championships. The Sphas won a total of 12 championships, their first two coming from the early Philadelphia League and Philadelphia Basket Ball League.

With the 1946 advent of the [[Basketball Association of America]], the immediate predecessor of the NBA, the ABL became a minor-league, and the Sphas would remain there as a semi-professional team until 1949. Gottlieb sold the team in 1950 to [[Red Klotz]], a former Spha. 1949 would be the last year the Sphas were affiliated with a league, but thanks to Gottlieb's friendship with [[Abe Saperstein]], president and owner of the [[Harlem Globetrotters]], the Sphas lived on as one of the exhibition teams that the Globetrotters would play, although they would retain only the franchise name, not the Jewish makeup of the team.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite popular wisdom, the Sphas did not directly evolve into the [[Washington Generals]]. Instead, Saperstein had asked Klotz to create a separate exhibition team because the Sphas had beaten the Globetrotters on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://joeposnanski.com/a-basketball-carol/|title=A Basketball Carol|date=2011-01-05|work=Joe Posnanski|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The SPHAS: The Life and Times of Basketball's Greatest Jewish Team|last=Stark|first=Douglas|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; After creating the Generals, Klotz sold the Sphas to one of his players, Pete Monska, who coached the team "for a year or two until it disbanded [in October 1959.]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Sphas played their last game as the original team on October 17, 1959, losing to the Globetrotters in a double-header exhibition game. The Sphas were then reconstituted as the Baltimore Rockets, another Globetrotters exhibition team.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:SPHAS BASKETBALL TEAM SIGN ON BROAD STREET.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission]] marker.]]

===Origins as YMHA===
The Sphas' existence began in 1917 as an amateur team by neighborhood friends [[Eddie Gottlieb]], Harry Passon, and Hughie Black, who wanted to keep their high school championship team together.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The team's [[1917-18 Philadelphia Sphas season|first season]] took place in the American League of Philadelphia, a minor league that comprised six area teams. They were sponsored by the Young Men's Hebrew Association of South Philadelphia, and were called Philadelphia YMHA for that season. The team turned in a 4–11 record, tied for last in the league that year.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Stark, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After that season, the YMHA withdrew its support for the team, citing dissatisfaction with the game's violent nature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Change to Sphas and "Wandering Jews" period===
After losing their sponsorship from the YMHA, Gottlieb, Passon, and Black approached the South Philadelphia Hebrew Association about sponsoring the team. The association agreed to sponsor the men, and provided funding for uniforms to the team. The new uniforms featured the acronym SPHA in Hebrew (ספהא) across the front. Again, their sponsorial relationship was short-lived, as the SPHA withdrew their sponsorship shortly after for an unspecified reason.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Stark, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The men had better financial solvency this time around, as they opened a sporting goods store, calling it P.G.B. Sporting Goods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the store, they created new uniforms, but kept the Sphas moniker as a way of paying tribute to their upbringing. Douglas Stark, author of ''The SPHAS: The Life and Times of Basketball's Greatest Jewish Team'', noted that "[f]or a number of years, the team was known as the Wandering Jews, because the team did not have its own home court."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Stark, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The team continued to play in the American League of Philadelphia after losing their partnership with the SPHA, and played in two different leagues during the 1922–23 season: The Manufacturer's League, containing teams from area companies, and the Philadelphia League, which consisted of teams from the greater Philadelphia area, a number of them religious.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In their single season in the Manufacturer's League, the team (known as Philadelphia Passon, Gottlieb, Black since they competed through Passon and Black's sporting goods store) turned in an overall 8–6 record, finishing 3rd in the first half of that season and 6th (out of 8) in the second half.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first season in the Philadelphia League was a disappointing one, turning in an 8–11 record and finishing 2nd in the first half of the season, but last in the second half at 1–8.&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sphas' next season in the Philadelphia League would prove more fruitful (due in part to the increased number of games), as the Sphas turned in a 25–15 record, overcoming a first half slump of 14–13 (5th out of 8) to finish first in the second half of the season with an 11–3 record. They went on that year to defeat the Tri-Council Caseys 2–0 for their first championship.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early championships, success against barnstorming teams, first ABL stint and name change===
For the 1924–25 season, the Philadelphia League reconstituted itself as the Philadelphia Basket Ball League, dropping the number of teams in the league to six.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Sphas continued a strong spate of play, finishing 1st in the first half of the season, and third in the second half. They would go on to be repeat champions that season, winning 2–1 again over Tri-Council.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Due to the success of the Sphas against teams in the Philadelphia area, and frustration with playing in the "poorly managed" Eastern League in 1924–25, owner Eddie Gottlieb set up games against professional teams from the newly-formed [[American Basketball League (1925–55)|American Basketball League]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Stark, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sphas played a six-game stretch against the [[Brooklyn Arcadians]], [[Fort Wayne Caseys]], [[Cleveland Rosenblums]], [[Washington Palace Five]], and a team from New York's Metropolitan League, the Paterson Legionaires. The Sphas won five out of six games in this series, and Gottlieb subsequently scheduled games against two top [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] teams of the day, the [[Original Celtics]] and [[New York Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Sphas defeated the Original Celtics 2–1 and swept the Rens, 2–0. The team's victories over these top barnstorming teams gave them increased notability in the burgeoning professional basketball community.&lt;ref&gt;Radel. Abe.“South Philadelphia Hebrew Association,” in The Reach Official Basket Ball Guide, 1926–27, ed. William Phillips (Philadelphia: A. J. Reach, 1926), 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Riding the wave of victories his team achieved against the ABL and barnstorming teams, Gottlieb entered the Sphas in the ABL, rechristening them the Philadelphia Warriors. During their two years in the ABL as the Warriors, the team performed moderately well, finishing third (14–7) and then fourth (10–11) in the 1926–27 season.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Stark, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; For the 1927–28 season, the ABL split into two divisions (Eastern and Western). The Warriors played in the Eastern Division and finished third with a 30–21 record. This allowed them entry into the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Celtics&lt;ref&gt;This team was in reality the [[Original Celtics]], who replaced the Brooklyn Arcadians. They took the name Brooklyn Celtics, then changed to New York Celtics for the 1927 season.&lt;/ref&gt; 2–0.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Appendix B, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''T3 Center''', formerly '''Umeå Arena''', '''SkyCom Arena''' and '''Umeå ishall''', is an indoor [[arena]] in [[Umeå]], [[Sweden]].  It is the home arena of the [[IF Björklöven]] and [[Tegs SK (ice hockey)|Tegs SK]] [[ice hockey]] teams. Its current capacity is 5,400 spectators. 

The arena was first opened on 17 December 1963 as '''Umeå ishall'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loven4ever.com/lucka-nr-17/|title=Lucka nr 17|publisher=Löven 4 Ever|language=Swedish|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rebuilt as Umeå Arena in 2001, which was the name until 2005. On 1 October 2008, the name was reverted to Umeå Arena after a new sponsor deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=SkyCom Arena blir Umeå Arena |url=http://www.umea.se/pressmeddelandearkiv/pressmeddelanden/skycomarenablirumeaarena.5.1821d6e811c67c7e795800029698.html |publisher=[[Umeå Municipality]] |date=5 October 2008 |language=Swedish |accessdate=12 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929011041/http://www.umea.se/pressmeddelandearkiv/pressmeddelanden/skycomarenablirumeaarena.5.1821d6e811c67c7e795800029698.html |archivedate=29 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 17 September 2013, the arena was renamed '''T3 Center''' after the Swedish telecommunication company T3 bought the [[naming rights]] for at least the following five seasons (through the 2017–18 season).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ruuth |first=Tomas |title=Umeå Arena blir T3 Center |url=http://www.vk.se/992278/umea-arena-blir-t3-center |work=sportnu.se |language=Swedish |date=17 September 2013 |accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ultramarathon''', also called '''ultra distance''' or '''ultra running''', is any footrace longer than the traditional [[marathon]] length of {{convert|42.195|km|mi}}.

==Overview==
There are two types of ultramarathon events: those that cover a specified distance, and events that take place during  time (with the winner covering the most distance in that time). The most common distances are {{convert|50|km|mi|3}}, {{convert|100|km|mi|3}}, {{convert|50|mi|km|4}}, and {{convert|100|mi|km|4}}, although many races have other distances. The 100 kilometers is recognized as an official world record event by the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]] (IAAF), the world governing body of track and field.&lt;ref name="IAAF 100 km Records"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/road-running/100-kilometres/outdoor/men/senior |title=– 100 Kilometres Records |publisher=Iaaf.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other distances/times include double marathons, [[24-hour run|24-hour races]], and [[multiday races]] of {{convert|1000|mi}} or even longer. The format of these events and the courses vary, ranging from single loops (some as short as a {{convert|400|m|sing=on}} track),&lt;ref&gt;If the loop is less than {{convert|1|km}}, run direction changes every 2–4  (sometimes 6) hours [Citation Needed~~~~Mark Halsey]&lt;/ref&gt; to point-to-point road or trail races, to cross-country [[rogaining|rogaines]]. Many ultramarathons, especially [[trail running|trail challenges]], have severe course obstacles, such as inclement weather, elevation change, or rugged terrain. Many of these races are run on [[dirt road]]s or [[trail|mountain paths]], though some are run on paved roads as well. Usually, there are [[aid station]]s every {{convert|20|to|35|km}} apart, where runners can replenish food and drink supplies or take a short break.
Timed events range from 6, 12, and 24 hours to 3, 6, and 10 days (known as ''multi-day'' or "stage race" events). Timed events are generally run on a track or a short road course, often one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) or less.&lt;ref name="IAAF Ultra Running"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaaf.org/disciplines/ultra-running/ultra-running |title=Ultra Running |website=Iaaf.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered to be a tougher event are self-supported ultramarathon stage races where each competitor has to carry all their supplies including food to survive the length of the race, typically a week. A good example of this is the Grand to Grand Ultra, America's first ever self-supported ultramarathon stage race.
 
The [[International Association of Ultrarunners]] (IAU) organises the World Championships for various ultramarathon distances, including {{convert|50|km}}, {{convert|100|km}}, 24 hours, and ultra [[trail running]], which are also recognized by the IAAF. Many countries around the world have their own ultrarunning organizations, often the national athletics federation of that country, or are sanctioned by such national athletics organizations. World records for distances, times, and ages are tracked by the IAU.

[[Racewalking]] events are usually 50&amp;nbsp;km, although [[100 kilometres race walk|100 km]] and [[Centurion (racewalking)|100 mile]] (160&amp;nbsp;km) "Centurion" races are also organized. Furthermore, the non-competitive [[International Marching League]] event Nijmegen Four Days March has a regulation distance of 4 × 50&amp;nbsp;km over three days for men aged 19–49.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.4daagse.nl/en/register/distance-rewards.html |title=Vierdaagse - Distance &amp; Rewards |website=4daagse.nl |date= |accessdate=2016-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107120104/http://www.4daagse.nl/en/register/distance-rewards.html |archivedate=7 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally a handful of runners have run the entire length of New Zealand, a distance of around {{convert|2200|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endurancesport.co.nz/feature.cfm?id=104 |title=Endurance Sport |publisher=Endurance Sport |date= |accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent runners being [http://www.lisatamati.co.nz Lisa Tamati] and [[Andrew Hedgman]] who both completed the challenge separately in 2009 and 2010.

'''Australia'''

In Australia, the [[Westfield Ultra Marathon]] was an annual race between Sydney and [[Melbourne]] contested between 1983 and 1991. Greek runner [[Yiannis Kouros]] won the event five times during that period. Australia is also the home of one of the oldest [[6 Day Race|six-day race]]s in the world, the [[Cliff Young Australian 6-day race]], held in [[Colac, Victoria]]. The race is held on a 400-meter circuit at the Memorial Square in the centre of Colac, and has seen many close races since its inception in 1984. The 20th Cliff Young Australian six-day race was held between 20 and 26 November 2005. During that event, Kouros beat his existing world record six-day track mark and set a new mark of {{convert|1036.851|km}}. The [[Coast to Kosciuszko]] inaugurated in 2004, is a {{convert|246|km|mi|adj=on}} marathon from the coast to the top of [[Mount Kosciuszko]], Australia's highest mountain.

Australia has seen a steep growth in Ultrarunning events and participants in recent years. Many new races have come into inception, covering a range of Ultramarathon distances from 50&amp;nbsp;km right through to multi-day events. The cornerstone of Australian Ultra events being such races as; Ultra-Trail Australia 100, Bogong To Hotham, Alpine Challenge, and the Cradle Mountain Run.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150321112809/http://www.rapidascent.com.au/salomontrailrunning/WhatIsTrailRunning ]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Ultra Runners Association (AURA) has a comprehensive list and links of events and their respective results.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145302/http://aura.asn.au/events.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Zealand'''
New Zealand's first ultramarathon called The [[Kepler Challenge]] was held on a {{convert|60|km}} trail through [[Fiordland National Park]], which has been running since 1988 and is one of the country's most popular races. New Zealand's [http://www.northburn100.co.nz Northburn 100 ultra mountain run] is the first 100-mile (160&amp;nbsp;km) race through the Northburn Station. The world-famous Te Houtaewa Challenge has a 62&amp;nbsp;km race on ninety mile beach, Northland. The field of international and local runners have to contend with rising tides and soft beach sand and the March race dates often means the race is run in the cyclone season. In 2014 the ultramarathon was postponed because of Cyclone Lucy. In 2016 the race will be in its jubilee and the 25th anniversary will see many of its past runners compete for the honour of the ultimate challenge winner. The [[Tarawera Ultramarathon]] is currently one of the most competitive ultras in New Zealand and part of the Ultra-Trail World Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taraweraultra.co.nz/ultra-trail-world-tour/|title=The Tarawera Ultramarathon 102km is part of the global Ultra-Trail ® World Tour .|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In Europe, ultrarunning can trace its origins with early documentation of ultrarunners from [[Iceland]]ic  [[saga]]s{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}, or ancient Greece from where the idea of the [[Marathon]], and the [[Spartathlon]] comes.  The history of ultrarunners and walkers in the UK from the [[Victorian Era]] has also been documented. The IAU hosts annual European Championships for the [[IAU 50 km European Championships|50&amp;nbsp;km]], [[IAU 100 km European Championships|100&amp;nbsp;km]] and [[IAU 24 hours European Championships|24 hours]]. The [[European Ultramarathon Cup]] is an annual cup event covering some of the biggest Ultramarathon races in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laufreport.de/nachrichten/press/index3.htm 25 years of ECU]&lt;/ref&gt; Also worth mentioning is the ultramarathon [[CajaMar Tenerife Bluetrail]], the highest race in [[Spain]] and second in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/deportes/abci-tenerife-bluetrail-carrera-mas-alta-espana-201610060829_noticia.html Tenerife Bluetrail, la carrera más alta de España]&lt;/ref&gt; with the participation of several countries and great international repercussions.

There are over 300 ultramarathons held in Europe each year,{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}.
This includes the [[Harz Run]] in the [[Harz Mountains]], the Irish [[Connemarathon]], the British [[Bob Graham Round]], [[Spine Race]] and Welsh [[Dragon's Back]] which covers 315km with 15,500m of height gain &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berghausdragonsbackrace.com/details/#displayROUTEInformation]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Antarctica===
Due to logistics and environmental concerns there are only a handful of ultramarathons held in Antarctica, and travel costs can mean entrance fees as high as  $14,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icemarathon.com/live/146.html |title=Antarctic Ice Marathon 2013 |publisher=Icemarathon.com |date=2013-03-07 |accessdate=2013-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001121438/http://www.icemarathon.com/live/146.html |archivedate=1 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ultramarathons in Antarctica include: [[The Last Desert]], part of the 4 Deserts Race Series, a multi-stage footrace, and the [[Antarctic Ice Marathon]] – a marathon and 100-kilometer race.

===North America===
There are several hundred ultramarathons held annually in North America. One of the best known is the [[Western States Endurance Run]], the world's oldest 100-mile trail run. The race began unofficially in 1974, when local horseman Gordy Ainsleigh's horse for the 100-mile [[Tevis Cup]] horse race came up lame. He decided to travel the course on foot, finishing in 23 hours and 42 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How it All Began |url=https://www.wser.org/how-it-all-began/ |website=wser.org |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first documented ultramarathons in North America was held in 1926, and at the time was part of the [[Central American Games]]. Tomas Zafiro and Leoncio San Miguel, both [[Tarahumara]] Indians, ran 100&amp;nbsp;km from [[Pachuca]] to Mexico City in 9 hours and 37 minutes. At the time, the Mexican government petitioned to include a 100&amp;nbsp;km race in the [[1928 Summer Olympics]] in [[Amsterdam]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}; however, nothing came of these efforts.

In 1928, sports agent [[C. C. Pyle]] organized the first of two editions of the 3,455-mile-long [[Bunion Derby]] (the first went along [[U.S. Route 66]] from Los Angeles to Chicago before heading toward New York; the 1929 Derby reversed the route). Neither the race nor the accompanying [[vaudeville]] show was a financial success.

Since 1997, runners have been competing in the [[Self-Transcendence 3100 Mile Race]], which is billed as the longest official footrace in the world. They run 100 laps a day for up to 50 days around a single block in Queens, NY, for a total distance of {{convert|3100|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name=scr/&gt; The current recordholder is [[Ashprihanal Pekka Aalto]], at 40 days 09:06:21 for a daily average of {{convert|76.776|mi|km}} in 2015.

The latest [[Trans-American Footrace]] (2015) winner was [[Robert HP Young]] (Marathon Man UK) Winning in a time of 482 hours 10 minutes 00 seconds &lt;ref name="Race Across USA Results"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raceacrossusa.org/results/ |format=PDF |title=Results : RAUSA Results |website=Raceacrossusa.org |accessdate=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, the [[American Ultrarunning Hall of Fame]] was established by the [[American Ultrarunning Association]] (AUA). Candidates for the Hall of Fame are chosen from the 'modern era' of American ultras, beginning with the [[New York Road Runners]] Club 30 Mile race held in 1958. The Inaugural inductees were [[Ted Corbitt]], a former US Olympian, winner of the aforementioned race in 3:04:13, and co-founder of the [[Road Runners Club of America]], and [[Sandra Kiddy]], who began her ultra career at age 42 with a world record at 50 kilometers, 3:36:56, and who went on to set a number of US and world ultra records.

===South America===
There are a small number of ultramarathons in South America, but participation in the sport is increasing. The '' Brazil 135 Ultramarathon'' is a single-stage race of 135 miles ( 217&amp;nbsp;km) with a 60-hour cutoff, held in Brazil. This is a Badwater "sister race".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110705183816/http://www.brazil135.com.br/pages/index.php ]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six stages in seven days, with almost four marathons run in the first four days, then a 74&amp;nbsp;km stretch, then a rest day and a final stage of 11&amp;nbsp;km. It is part of the [[4 Deserts]] Series. The race covers rugged terrain, with a harsh climate and an altitude that averages 2500&amp;nbsp;m (8000&amp;nbsp;ft). The race uses the town of [[San Pedro de Atacama]] as its host town, and in 2012 the race began at its highest point of over 3,000m in the Arcoiris Valley.

==International Trail Running Association (ITRA)==
Many ultramarathon organizers are members of the [[International Trail Running Association]] (ITRA), an organization which promotes values, diversity, health and safety during races, as well as working to further the development of trail running and helps to coordinate between the national and international bodies with an interest in the sport.  ITRA also evaluates of the difficulty of specific ultramarathon routes according to a number of criteria, such as the distance, the cumulative elevation gain, and the number of loops and stages. ITRA maintains a calendar of ultramarathon events.

'''Estádio Vivaldo Lima''', usually known by its nickname '''Vivaldão''', was a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Manaus]], [[Brazil]]. It was formerly used mostly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium held 36,000, with 31,000 seats. It was built between 1958 and 1970.

The Vivaldão was owned by the government of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas state]]. The stadium was named after Vivaldo Lima, who was the founder of [[Nacional Fast Clube]] and it was the home ground of [[América Futebol Clube (AM)]], [[Nacional Futebol Clube]] and [[Atlético Rio Negro Clube]].

The stadium was demolished in 2011 and replaced by the [[Arena da Amazônia]].

==History==
In 1970, construction of the Vivaldão was completed. The inaugural match was played on April 5 of that year, when [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national football team B]] beat Amazonas State All-Stars team B 4-1, followed by the match of the teams A, also 4-1. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Brazil B's [[Dadá Maravilha]].

The stadium's record attendance was 56,950, set on March 9, 1980 when Fast Clube and [[New York Cosmos (1970–85)|New York Cosmos]] of the [[United States]] drew 0-0.

== Demolition ==
On May 31, 2009, Manaus was chosen as one of the host cities of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. The city's project involved the demolition of the Vivaldão, and a new stadium built in its place, the [[Arena da Amazônia]], with a capacity of 41,000 people. About R$580,000,000 was invested in the construction of the new stadium, which will include sport and recreation areas and a shopping mall.

The stadium was closed on March 19, 2010, and demolition began on July 12.
