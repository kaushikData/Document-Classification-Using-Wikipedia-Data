      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9782">The '''1931 Cyprus revolt''' or '''October Events''' ({{lang-el|Οκτωβριανά}}, ''Oktovriana'') was an anti-colonial revolt that took place in [[Cyprus]], then a [[British Cyprus|British crown colony]], between 21 October and early November 1931. The revolt was spearheaded by [[Greek Cypriots|Greek Cypriot]] nationalists who advocated the [[Enosis]] (Union) of the island with Greece. The defeat of the rebels led to a period of repressive British rule known as "Palmerocracy" (Παλμεροκρατία), that would last until the beginning of [[World War II]].

==Background==
At the outbreak of the [[First World War]], [[Cyprus]] was nominally a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], while in fact being administered by the [[British Empire]] as agreed in the [[Cyprus Convention]] of 1878. On 5 November 1914, the Ottomans entered the conflict on the side of the [[Central Powers]], prompting Britain to void the Cyprus Convention and annex the island as the two states were now at war. In 1915, Britain offered Cyprus to Greece in exchange for the Greek intervention into the World War I on the side of the [[Triple Entente]]. The Greek government refused the offer as at the time it was embroiled in a deep internal crisis known as the [[National Schism]]. Cyprus had already been described as a bargaining chip for negotiating with the Greeks when it was offered in exchange for the deep water port of [[Argostoli]] in 1912.{{sfn|Klapsis|2013|pp=765–767}}

Following the end of the war Britain received international recognition of its claims to the island at the 1923 [[Conference of Lausanne]]. Greece was the only country that could potentially contest the decision, based on the fact that four fifths of its population were [[Greek Cypriots|ethnically Greek]]. However at the time Greece faced economic ruin and diplomatic isolation as a result of a disastrous defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]], thus Greek envoys made no mention of Cyprus at the conference. Cyprus then attained the status of a [[crown colony]] and the number of the [[Cypriot Legislative Council]] members was increased in favor of British officials. The aforementioned setbacks did not put a halt to the spread of the [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) and the closely related [[Enosis]] (Union) ideologies, the ultimate goal of which was the incorporation of all areas populated by Greeks into an independent Greek state. The November 1926 appointment of [[Ronald Storrs]] (a philhellene) as the new governor of Cyprus, fostered the idea among Greek Cypriot nationalists that British rule would be a stepping stone for the eventual union with Greece.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=127–131}} 

Their relationship was to sour in 1928, when Greek Cypriots refused to take part in the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the British occupation of Cyprus. Greece once again appealed for calm, limiting the spread of anti-colonial articles in Greek Cypriot newspapers. Education became another arena of conflict with the passage of the Education Act, which sought to curtail Greek influence in the Cypriot school curricula. The [[Church of Cyprus]] which at the time played an important role in the social and political life of the island became one of the bastions of Greek nationalism. Cypriot irredentists also lamented the supposedly preferential treatment of [[Malta]] and Egypt at the expense of Cyprus.{{sfn|Frendo|1998|pp=47–51}} Relations worsened further when the British authorities  unilaterally passed a new penal code which permitted among other things the use of torture. In 1929, Legislative Council members Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos and Stavros Stavrinakis arrived in London, presenting a memorandum to the secretary of colonies [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]] which contained demands for Enosis. As with previous such attempts the answer was negative.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=131–135}}

==Conflict==
[[File:Cypriot demonstration 1930.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A Cypriot demonstration in the 1930s in favor of Enosis.]]
In September 1931, Storrs blocked a Legislative Council decision to halt tax hikes that were to cover a local budget deficit. Greek Cypriot MPs reacted by resigning from their positions. Furthermore, on 18 October, Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos called Greek Cypriots to engage in acts of [[civil disobedience]] until their demands for Enosis were fulfilled. On 21 October, 5,000 Greek Cypriots, mostly students, priests and city notables rallied in the streets of [[Nicosia]] while chanting pro–Enosis slogans. The crowd besieged the Government House, following three hours of stone throwing the building was set on fire, the rioters were eventually dispersed by police. At the same time British flags were stripped from public offices across the country, often being substituted with Greek ones. Order was restored by the beginning of November.The British accused the Greek general counsel in Nicosia Alexis Kyrou (a Greek nationalist of Cypriot descent) of instigating the revolt. Kyrou had indeed worked behind the scenes to create a united opposition front against the British prior to the revolt, in direct disobedience to the orders he received from Athens. A total of 7 protesters were killed, 30 were injured, 10 were exiled for life, while 2,606 received various punishments ranging from prison terms to fines on account of seditious activities.{{sfn|Klapsis|2009|pp=135–136}}{{sfn|Rappas|2008|pp=363–364}}

==Aftermath==
The revolt led to the dismissal of Kyrou whose actions had inadvertently damaged both the Enotic cause and the Anglo–Hellenic relations. The revolt also dealt a blow to Storrs' career, he was soon transferred to the post of [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia]]. The Legislative Council and municipal elections were abolished, the appointment of village authorities and district judges was relegated to the governor of the island. Propagating Enotic ideas and flying foreign flags was banned as was the assembly of more than 5 people. The new measures were aimed at suppressing the operation of the Orthodox church and communist organizations. Censorship had a severe effect on the operation of newspapers especially those associated with left wing politics. Cyprus thus entered a period of autocratic rule known as ''Palmerokratia'' (Παλμεροκρατία, "Palmerocracy"), named after governor [[Richmond Palmer]], which started shortly before the revolt and would last until the beginning of [[World War II]]. The revolt has been described as the most severe anti-colonial movement that Britain faced in the [[interwar period]]. The revolt is known in Cypriot historiography as ''Oktovriana'' (October Events).{{sfn|Rappas|2008|pp=363–369}}

Monuments commemorating the October Events were erected in [[Strovolos]] and [[Pissouri]] in November 2007 and October 2016 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.gov.cy/Presidency/Presidency.nsf/All/B88AE10632EE333BC225805E00359309?OpenDocument

'''Adamantios Korais'''  or '''Koraïs''' ({{lang-el|Ἀδαμάντιος Κοραῆς}}; {{lang-la|Adamantius Coraes}}; {{lang-fr|Adamance Coray}}; 27 April 1748{{snd}}6 April 1833) was a Greek scholar credited with laying the foundations of [[Modern Greek literature]] and a major figure in the [[Greek Enlightenment]]. His activities paved the way for the [[Greek War of Independence]] and the emergence of a purified form of the Greek language, known as [[Katharevousa]]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' asserts that "his influence on the modern Greek language and culture has been compared to that of [[Dante]] on Italian and [[Martin Luther]] on German".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9046052/Adamantios-Korais|title=Adamantios Korais - biography - Greek scholar|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and views==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
Korais was born in [[Smyrna]], in 1748. His father Ioannis, of [[Chios|Chian]] descent, was ''demogérontas'' in Smyrna; a seat similar to the [[kodjabashis|prokritoi]] of mainland Greece, but elected by the Greek community of the town and not imposed by the Ottomans.
[[File:A. Korais΄ house in Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|180px|Residence of Korais in Amsterdam]]

He was exceptionally passionate about [[philosophy]], [[literacy]] and [[linguistics]] and studied greatly throughout his youth. He initially studied in his home place, where he graduated from the [[Evangelical School of Smyrna|Evangelical Greek School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1= Trencsényi |first1=Balázs  |last2= Kopeček |first2=Michal | title=Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945): texts and commentaries |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&amp;pg=PA141 | publisher=Central European University Press | year=2006 | isbn= 978-963-7326-52-3| page =141}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After his school years, he lived for a while in [[Amsterdam]] as a merchant, but soon he decided that he wanted to study in a university. He studied also the Jewish, Dutch, French and English languages, apart from his knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin. 

Korais studied at the school of medicine of the [[University of Montpellier]] from 1782 to 1787. His 1786 [[diploma thesis]] was entitled ''Pyretologiae Synopsis'', while his 1787 [[doctoral thesis]] was entitled ''Medicus Hippocraticus''.&lt;ref&gt;Ioannis Taifakos, "Korais and Latin" in ''Proceedings of Korais Congress and Chios (Chios 11–15 May 1983)'', '''I''', Athens:  Omirion Pnevmatikon Kentron Chiou, 1984, pp. 67–89, esp. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; 

He traveled to Paris where he would continue his enthusiasm for knowledge. There he decided to translate [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] authors and produced thirty volumes of those translations, being one of the first modern Greek philologists and publishers of ancient Greek literature.

After 1788 he was to spend most of his life as an [[expatriate]] in Paris. A classical scholar, Korais was repelled by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] influence in Greek society and was a fierce critic of the lack of education amongst the clergy and their subservience to the [[Ottoman Empire]], although he conceded it was the Orthodox Church that preserved the national identity of Greeks.

While in Paris, he was witness to the [[French Revolution]]. He was influenced by the revolutionary and liberal sentiments of his age. He admired [[Thomas Jefferson]]; and exchanged political and philosophical thoughts with the American statesman. A typical man of [[the Enlightenment]], Korais encouraged wealthy Greeks to open new libraries and schools throughout Greece. Korais believed that education would ensure not only the achievement of independence but also the establishment of a proper constitution for the new liberated Greek state. He envisioned a democratic Greece, recapturing the glory of the Golden Age of [[Pericles]].

Korais died in Paris aged 84 soon after publishing the first volume of his autobiography. In 1877, his remains were sent to Greece, to be buried there.

==Publications==
[[File:Salpisma Polemisterion - Hellas.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover from his "Salpisma Polemistirion" (1801)]]

Korais's most lasting contributions were literary. Those who were instrumental in publishing, and presenting his work to the public were merchants from [[Chios]].   He felt eternally grateful to these merchants, since without them, it would have been financially impossible for him to publish his works. These works included [[Strabo]] in Greek, another on [[Marcus Aurelius]], his translation of [[Herodotus]], the translation of the [[Iliad]], and his main literary work, the seventeen volumes of the "Library of Greek Literature".

His political writing really begins with the publication at the opening of the nineteenth century of ''[[Asma Polemistirion]]'' ("War Chant") and ''[[Salpisma Polemistirion]]'' ("Military Bugal Call"), celebrating the presence of Greek troops [[French invasion of Egypt (1798)|fighting alongside the French]] in Egypt.  Earlier he had attacked with his ''[[Adelphiki Didaskalia]]'' the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem|Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem]] for urging the Sultan's Christian subjects to support him in the war against the 'atheistic' French.

Korais went on to publish in 1803 his ''Report on the Present State of Civilization in Greece'', based on a series of lectures he had given in Paris, extolling the link between the rise of a new Greek mercantile class and the advance of the Greek Enlightenment or [[Diafotismos]].  In ''What should we Greeks do in the Present Circumstances?'', a work of 1805, he tried to win his compatriots over to [[Napoleon]] and away from the cause of their Russian co-religionists.  In later years, though, his enthusiasm for the French Emperor diminished, and he ended by referring to him as the 'tyrant of tyrants.'

Away from contemporary politics, Korais did much to revive the idea of Greece with the creation of the [[Hellenic Library]], devoted to new editions of some of the classic texts, starting with [[Homer]] in 1805.  Over the following twenty years many others appeared, with lengthy prefaces by Korais entitled 'Impromptu Reflections', with his views on political, educational and linguistic matters.  Although the broad mass of the Greek people was beyond his reach, he played an important part in the shaping of a new consciousness among the [[intelligentsia]], which was to play a part in the creation of a new national movement.

==On religion==
Korais was a Greek Orthodox but also a critic of many practices of the Orthodox church. He was a fierce critic of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]], considering it as a useful tool in the hands of the [[Ottoman empire|Ottomans]] against the Greek independence. So, later, he was one of the supporters of the new established [[Church of Greece]].

He was also critic of the [[monasticism]], the ignorance of the clergy, and practices like that of the "[[Holy Fire]]". He was a supporter of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]], empiricism, rationalism and tolerance. He set himself in opposition to some metaphysical ideals of Greek custom and sought to mould Greek Orthodoxy towards a more syncretic religious basis, in order to bring it under the auspices of liberal thought and government.

==On Greek language==
[[File:Cénotaphe Adamántios Koraïs, Cimetière du Montparnasse.jpg|thumb|180px|Cenotaph of Korais; [[Montparnasse Cemetery]].]]

One of his most significant accomplishments was his contribution to the redefining of the Greek Language. The Greeks were dispersed so widely across Europe, people who served several masters. He decided to purge the [[Demotic Greek|Demotic]] (the vernacular or spoken language) of foreign elements (such as Turkish, but also Western, words and phrases). His vision led to the creation of [[Katharevousa]] by future scholars.

His intent was to bring the language as close as possible to the classic of Ancient Greece. This effort ultimately led to his publishing the "[[Atakta]]", the first Modern Greek dictionary.

==Influence on the Greek constitutional and legal system==
[[File:Adamantios Korais statue Athens.jpg|thumb|180px|Statue of Korais in Athens (work of [[Ioannis Kossos]]).]]

Unknown to most, Korais held passionate views on how the legal system should function in a democracy (views which of course, were greatly influenced by the French Enlightenment, closer to [[Montesquieu]] than to [[Rousseau]]) and managed to have a great, albeit indirect, impact on the Constitutions of the Greek Revolution, but also, primarily, on the [[Constitutions]] or Syntagma created after the end of the Greek Revolution. This element holds significant importance if one takes into consideration the fact that these meta-Revolution Constitutions still, to the present day, form the basis of the Greek Constitution and the philosophy on which the guiding principles of the Greek legal and judicial system are rooted in.

This influence Korais exercised on Greek Law, was due to a personal relationship the intellectual formed with another Greek intellectual, the legal scholar of international repute [[Nikolaos Saripolos|N. I. Saripolos]], who, after the Greek Revolution, became the founding father of Greek Law and the "author" of the Greek Constitution. Proof of this relationship and of the strong and progressive views Korais held on how the legal system of the new Greek state should be formed, is based on correspondence exchanged between the two men, during a long period of time, beginning before the Greek Revolution. These letters which manifest the influence the older intellectual (Korais) had on the then aspiring lawmaker Saripolos, are in the possession of the archives of the Greek National Library, were discovered and brought to academic light, in 1996, by a Law School student, researching a project sponsored by the Faculty of Law of the University of Athens and the National Academy for Constitutional Research and Public Law (adjacent to the University of Athens). The ensuing thesis was published.&lt;ref&gt;Aμαλία Νεγρεπόντη, [http://www.efdimdik.gr/arxeio/1_1996.html "Ν.Ι. Σαρίπολου "Περί της Δικαστικής Εξουσίας""] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124023103/http://www.efdimdik.gr/arxeio/1_1996.html |date=24 November 2011 }}, "Εφαρμογές Δημοσίου Δικαίου", Τεύχος1/1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Korais was declared ''Pater Patriae'' ("Pateras tis Patridos") by the revolutionaries at the [[Third National Assembly at Troezen]].

Korais' portrait was depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Greek 100 [[Greek drachma|drachmas]] banknote of 1978–2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en Bank of Greece] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328051044/http://www.bankofgreece.gr/en |date=28 March 2009 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6691">'''Adolf Mahr''' (7 May 1887 - 27 May 1951) was an [[Austrian people|Austrian]] [[archaeologist]], who served as director of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], in the 1930s, and is credited with advancing the work of the museum substantially. Through his becoming the Leader of the Dublin Nazi chapter, and later broadcasting propaganda from Germany, he became a highly controversial figure in twentieth-century Irish history,&lt;ref name=”Mullins”&gt;{{cite book|last=Mullins|first=Gerry|title=Dublin Nazi No. 1 : the life of Adolf Mahr|year=2007|publisher=Liberties Press|location=Dublin, Ireland|isbn=978-1905483204}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} and was not allowed to return to his job after the war.

==Life==
===Early life===
Mahr was born in May 1887 in Trent in the southern reaches of the Habsburg Empire.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Maume, P |first1=McGuinness, D |title=Mahr, Adolf |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do;?articleId=a5400 |website=Dictionary of Irish Biography |publisher=Royal Irish Academy / Cambridge University Press |accessdate=22 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[:de:Gustav Mahr|Gustav Johann Mahr]], and grandfather, Franz Anton Mahr (1830–1891), were military bandmasters and well-known composers. His mother, Maria Antonia Schroll, like his father, was a German from the Sudetenland.  Mahr was brought up as a Roman Catholic, later becoming an atheist, and later still (at least nominally) Protestant.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"/&gt;

===Early career and university===
Mahr served in the Austrian Army in 1906, attaining the rank of lieutenant, and then studied geography and prehistory at the [[University of Vienna]], where he also sustained a long-term arm injury while duelling.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"/&gt;

===Professional career===
Mahr went to work for a museum in [[Linz]], Austria's third city, and then the [[Natural History Museum, Vienna|Natural History and Prehistoric Museum of Vienna]], where he rose to the ranks of curator and deputy director of a section.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"/&gt;

His excavation work included early exploration of the salt mine and Iron Age Celtic cemetery at [[Hallstatt]].  

Mahr arrived in Ireland in 1927 to work as Senior Keeper of (Irish) Antiquities in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]], succeeding Walther Bremer.&lt;ref name=NatMus&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitty |first=Audrey |title=An Unexpected Friendship: Albert Bender and Adolf Mahr |url=http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/albert-bender.aspx?article=584e0abf-71be-4626-877d-cb0bd7404d18 |work=A Dubliner’s Collection of Asian Art – The Albert Bender Exhibition |publisher=[[National Museum of Ireland]] |accessdate=12 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526233224/http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/albert-bender.aspx?article=584e0abf-71be-4626-877d-cb0bd7404d18 |archivedate=26 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mahr implemented the recommendations of Professor Nils Lithberg on reorganisation of the collections, and otherwise worked to bring order to the museum's holdings.  One of his key achievements was the production of a card index of excavations and finds, and he also drove a return to active archaeological dig work, after an interval of decades.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"/&gt;

In 1934 [[Éamon de Valera]] appointed Mahr as the director of the museum, for which he built an international reputation through creativity and dedication.  de Valera was so impressed with his commitment that he wrote him a personal cheque for one excavation project, in [[Drimnagh]], Dublin, for what was then a considerable sum.

During a stay for an archaeology congress in Berlin and family visit to Austria, on September 1, 1939, he was kept by Nazi Germany ("[[Heim ins Reich]]") (the ship did not leave the harbour&lt;ref&gt;personal communication of Mahr's daughter Hilde&lt;/ref&gt;) due to the outbreak of the war, and could not return to his directorship, from which he took a leave of absence.&lt;ref name=”Mullins” /&gt;{{rp|106}}  At the time, he still expected to be back in Dublin by early 1940.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"/&gt;

===Nazi activities===
As the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in the 1930s, Mahr had joined in 1933 and became the Local Group Leader (''Ortsgruppenleiter'') of the official [[Nazi Party]] in Ireland - the Auslandsorganisation (NSDAP-AO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ria.ie/pdfs/huntreport.pdf NSDP-AO - Irish Nazi Party]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517085435/http://www.ria.ie/pdfs/huntreport.pdf |date=May 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his spell as Nazi leader he recruited roughly 23 Germans.

Later, Mahr was arrested and (falsely) accused of being a Nazi spy, using his position as Director of the National Museum to plan Hitler's invasion of Ireland.&lt;ref name=”Mullins” /&gt; After his release, Mahr tried to return to his director’s position in Ireland, but was not allowed to do so.&lt;ref name=”Mullins” /&gt;

===Late life===
Mahr sought to return to his directorship, and the Taoiseach was originally in favour, given his achievements, but there was opposition from the Head of Military Intelligence, and a vocal TD.  In the end, Mahr was left in Germany, but given some pension, and derived some income from occasional lectures.  He died of heart failure in [[Bonn]] while preparing for a new job, on 27 May 1951.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"/&gt;

==Family==
In 1921 Mahr married Maria van Bemmelen (1901-1975), daughter of a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] university professor.  They had four children, two born in Ireland, and all were raised in Dublin in the 1930s but stranded in Germany and Austria in September 1939, ending up in post-war Germany.&lt;ref name=”Mullins” /&gt;  His marriage deteriorated from 1941.&lt;ref name="RIACUPDIB"/&gt; One daughter later moved back to Ireland for a time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2293">'''Albert Bruckner''' (13 July 1904, Basel – 10 December 1985, [[Finkenberg]], aged 81) was a Swiss historian, [[palaeographer]] and [[Medieval studies|medievalist]].

Albert Bruckner, the son of a pastor of the same name, studied history in Basel, Lausanne, Berlin, Florence and Münster. After his doctorate in Cologne in 1929, he was an assistant in Berlin. In 1931 he returned to Basel. From 1933 to 1941 he was active at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Staatsarchiv Basel-Stadt|de}}, and from 1961 to 1966 he was head of the department. From 1948 onwards, Bruckner was an extraordinary professor of medieval history at the [[University of Basel]]. From 1966 until 1974, he was head of the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Helvetia Sacra|de}}''.

With [[Robert Marichal]], Albert Bruckner is at the origin of the ''Chartae Latinae Antiquiores'', a facsimile collection of documents written before 800, as a parallel company to the ''[[Codices Latini Antiquiores]]''. After Bruckner's death, Robert Marichal was left single publishing director until 1994, when he was replaced by Hartmut Atsma and [[Jean Vezin]].

'''''Bellerophon''''' ({{lang-grc|Βελλεροφῶν}}, ''Bellerophōn'') is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[tragedy]] written by [[Euripides]], based upon the myth of [[Bellerophon]]. Most of the play was lost by the end of the Antiquity, and only 90 verses, grouped into 29 fragments, currently survive. 

==Plot==
Given the fragmentary state of this tragedy, the plot remains open to conjecture. Most modern critics nevertheless agree on the following storyline. 

The play apparently began with [[Bellerophon]] riding his horse [[Pegasus]] carried in the air by the crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Euripides and the Spirit of His Dramas|author=Decharme, P.|page=263|year=2006|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-1-4286-4768-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellerophon, who seems to have lost everything, lives on an uncultivated land with his father [[Glaucos]] and [[Pegasus]]. Deeply pessimistic about his condition, Bellerophon eventually believes the gods do not exist. 

He subsequently decides to reach [[Mt. Olympus]], thanks to Pegasus's flying abilities. The motives of such an ascent have remained unclear. Regardless, Pegasus falls with his rider and the wounded Bellerophon is brought to the stage. Having repented for his blasphemous behaviour, Bellerophon dies.

'''Bergen''' ({{IPA-no|ˈbærɡn̩|-|Bergen.ogg}}), historically '''Bjørgvin''', is a [[city]] and [[municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Hordaland]] on the [[Western Norway|west coast]] of [[Norway]]. {{As of|2018|07|alt=At the end of the first quarter of 2018}}, the municipality's population was 280,216,&lt;ref name=Pop2018Q1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/statistikker/folkemengde|title=Population and quarterly population changes. The whole country, counties and municipalities|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bergen metropolitan region has about 420,000 inhabitants. Bergen is the [[list of towns and cities in Norway|second-largest]] city in Norway. The municipality covers {{convert|465|km2}} and is on the peninsula of [[Bergenshalvøyen]]. The city centre and northern neighbourhoods are on [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]], 'the city fjord', and the city is surrounded by mountains; Bergen is known as the 'city of [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|seven mountains]]'. Many of the extra-municipal suburbs are on islands. Bergen is the [[administrative centre]] of Hordaland, and consists of eight boroughs - [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Bergenhus]], [[Fana]], [[Fyllingsdalen]], [[Laksevåg]], [[Ytrebygda]], [[Årstad, Bergen|Årstad]], and [[Åsane]].

Trading in Bergen may have started as early as the 1020s. According to tradition, the city was founded in 1070 by king [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]] and was named Bjørgvin, 'the green meadow among the mountains'. It served as Norway's capital in the 13th century, and from the end of the 13th century became a bureau city of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Until 1789, Bergen enjoyed exclusive rights to mediate trade between [[Northern Norway]] and abroad and it was the largest city in Norway until the 1830s when it was surpassed by the capital, Christiania (now known as [[Oslo]]). What remains of the quays, [[Bryggen]], is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The city was hit by numerous fires over the years. The [[Bergen School of Meteorology]] was developed at the [[Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen|Geophysical Institute]] beginning in 1917, the [[Norwegian School of Economics]] was founded in 1936, and the [[University of Bergen]] in 1946. From 1831 to 1972, Bergen was its own [[counties of Norway|county]]. In 1972 the municipality absorbed four surrounding municipalities and became a part of Hordaland county.

The city is an international center for [[aquaculture]], [[ship transport|shipping]], offshore [[petroleum industry]] and [[subsea]] technology, and a national centre for higher education, media, tourism and finance. [[Bergen Port]] is Norway's busiest in terms of both freight and passengers with over 300 cruise ship calls a year bringing nearly a half a million passengers to Bergen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heggemsnes|first1=Nils|title=Bergen Havn|url=https://snl.no/Bergen_havn|website=Store norske leksikon|accessdate=8 January 2016|language=Norwegian|date=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number that has doubled in 10 years.&lt;ref name="Port of Bergen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cruisestatistikk|url=http://bergenhavn.no/cruise/cruisestatistikk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526145406/http://bergenhavn.no/cruise/cruisestatistikk/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-05-26|website=Cruise|publisher=Port of Bergen|accessdate=8 January 2016|language=Norwegian|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost half of the passengers are German or British.&lt;ref name="Port of Bergen" /&gt; The city's main football team is [[SK Brann]] and the city's unique tradition is the [[buekorps]]. Natives speak a distinct dialect, known as '[[Bergensk]]'. The city features [[Bergen Airport, Flesland]], [[Bergen Light Rail]], and is the terminus of the [[Bergen Line]]. Four large bridges connect Bergen to its suburban municipalities.

Bergen has a mild winter climate, though with a lot of precipitation. During December - March, the temperature difference between Bergen and Oslo can be up to 30 degrees Celsius, despite the fact that both cities are at approximately 60 degrees North. The [[Gulf Stream]] keeps the sea relatively warm, considering the latitude, and the mountains protect the city from cold winds from the north, north-east and east.

The city of Bergen was traditionally thought to have been founded by king [[Olaf III of Norway|Olav Kyrre]], son of [[Harald III of Norway|Harald Hardråde]] in 1070&amp;nbsp;AD,&lt;ref name="omkomm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bergen.kommune.no/aktuelt/omkommunen |title=Om kommunen |accessdate=16 September 2007 |publisher=Bergen kommune |year=2007 |author=Elisabeth Farstad |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005165817/http://www.bergen.kommune.no/aktuelt/omkommunen |archivedate=5 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; four years after the Viking Age ended with the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]. Modern research has, however, discovered that a trading settlement was already established during the 1020s or 1030s.&lt;ref&gt;NRK, "[http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hordaland/1.201637 Bergens historie må skrives om]"&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bergen gradually assumed the function of capital of Norway in the early 13th century, as the first city where a rudimentary central administration was established. The city's cathedral was the site of the first royal coronation in Norway in the 1150s, and continued to host royal coronations throughout the 13th century. 

[[Bergenhus fortress]] dates from 1240s and guards the entrance to the harbour in Bergen. The functions of the capital city were lost to [[Oslo]] during the reign of King [[Haakon V of Norway|Haakon V]] (1299-1319). 

In the middle of the 14th century, North German merchants who had already been present in substantial numbers since the 13th century, founded one of the four ''{{lang|de|[[Kontor]]e}}'' of the [[Hanseatic League]] at [[Bryggen]] in Bergen.

The principal export traded from Bergen was dried cod from the northern Norwegian coast,&lt;ref name="codmr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bell.lib.umn.edu/Products/cod.html |title=Cod |accessdate=14 August 2007 |year=2007 |author=Marguerite Ragnow }}&lt;/ref&gt; which started around 1100. The city was granted monopoly with regard to trade from the north of Norway, by King [[Håkon Håkonsson]] (1217-1263).&lt;ref name=Stockfish&gt;{{cite news|title=- Tørrfisken vender hjem|newspaper=Bergensavisen|date=2013-12-16|author=Tom R.

In 1349, the [[Black Death]] was inadvertently brought to [[Norway]] by the crew of an English ship arriving in Bergen.&lt;ref name="14thBD"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WYpLLDoMTxQC&amp;pg=PA18 |last=Carl Hecker |first=Justus Friedrich |year=1833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, the city was attacked several times by the [[Victual Brothers]],&lt;ref name="avikinghist"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of the Vikings |url=https://books.google.com/?id=3Z8NgXgRytUC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=victual+brothers+bergen |last=Downing Kendrick |first=Thomas |author-link=T. D. Kendrick |page=142 |isbn=978-0-486-43396-7 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1429 they succeeded in burning the royal castle and much of the city. In 1665, the city's harbour was the site of the [[Battle of Vågen]], where an English naval flotilla attacked a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet supported by the city's garrison.

Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Bergen remained one of the largest cities in [[Scandinavia]], and was Norway's biggest city until the 1830s,&lt;ref name="attentretti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/sab/innvandring/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021206093817/http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/sab/innvandring/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 December 2002 |title=Innvandring 1600-2000, Arkivenes dag 2002 |accessdate=9 October 2007 |publisher=Arkivverket |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; when the capital city of [[Oslo]] became the largest. From around 1600, the Hanseatic dominance of the city's trade gradually declined in favour of Norwegian merchants (often of Hanseatic ancestry), and in the 1750s, the Hanseatic ''{{lang|de|Kontor}}'' finally closed. Bergen retained its monopoly of trade with [[Northern Norway]] until 1789.&lt;ref name="histnor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/dok/NOU-er/2003/NOU-2003-32/10.html?id=373172 |title=Historien om Norge i nord |accessdate=9 October 2007 |publisher=Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |year=2003 |author=Ivan Kristoffersen |language=Norwegian |authorlink=Ivan Kristoffersen |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328031006/http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/dok/NOU-er/2003/NOU-2003-32/10.html?id=373172 |archivedate=28 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bergen stock exchange, ''{{lang|no|Bergen børs}}'', was established in 1813.

Bergen was separated from Hordaland as a county of its own in 1831.&lt;ref name="distriktsinnd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/fad/dok/Veiledninger_og_brosjyrer/1995/Fylkesmannboka/4-Fylkesmannsembetene/43-Distriktsinndeling-og-navn.html?id=464957 |title=Distriktsinndeling og navn |accessdate=16 September 2007 |publisher=Fornyings- og administrasjonsdepartementet |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see {{lang|no|[[formannskapsdistrikt]]}}).

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Bergen was occupied on the first day of the German invasion on 9 April 1940, after a brief fight between German ships and the Norwegian [[coastal artillery]]. On 20 April 1944, during the German occupation, the Dutch cargo ship ''{{lang|nl|[[Voorbode]]}}'' anchored off the [[Bergenhus Fortress]], loaded with over 120&amp;nbsp;tons of explosives, blew up, killing at least 150 people and damaging historic buildings. The city was subject to some Allied [[strategic bombing|bombing raids]], aimed at German naval installations in the harbour. Some of these caused Norwegian [[civilian casualties]] numbering about 100.

The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] groups in Bergen were [[Osvald Group|Saborg]], [[Milorg]], ''"{{lang|no|[[Theta (SIS radio group)|Theta-gruppen]]}}"'', [[Sivorg]], ''{{lang|no|[[Stein-organisasjonen]]}}'' and the Communist Party.&lt;ref name=Prosjektbeskrivelse&gt;{{cite news|title=Prosjektbeskrivelse for det historiske forskningsprosjektet SABORG I BERGEN|url=http://www.fagforbundet.no/file.php?id=11179|author=Jenny Heggsvik|author2=[[Lars Borgersrud]]|author3=August Rathke|author4=Egil Christophersen|author5=Ole-Jacob Abraham|access-date=30 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313131238/http://www.fagforbundet.no/file.php?id=11179|archive-date=13 March 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fires===
The city's history is marked by numerous great fires. In 1198, the {{lang|no|[[Bagler]]}} faction set fire to the city in connection with a battle against the {{lang|no|[[Birkebeiner]]}} faction during the civil war. In 1248, {{lang|no|Holmen}} and {{lang|no|Sverresborg}} burned, and 11 churches were destroyed. In 1413 another fire struck the city, and 14 churches were destroyed. In 1428 the city was plundered by German pirates, and in 1455, [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] merchants were responsible for burning down [[Munkeliv Abbey]]. In 1476, {{lang|no|Bryggen}} burned down in a fire started by a drunk trader. In 1582, another fire hit the city centre and {{lang|no|Strandsiden}}. In 1675, 105 buildings burned down in {{lang|no|Øvregaten}}. In 1686 a new great fire hit {{lang|no|Strandsiden}}, destroying 231 city blocks and 218 boathouses. The greatest fire to date happened in 1702 when 90 percent of the city was burned to ashes. In 1751, there was a great fire at {{lang|no|Vågsbunnen}}. In 1756, a new fire at {{lang|no|Strandsiden}} burned down 1,500 buildings, and further great fires hit {{lang|no|Strandsiden}} in 1771 and 1901. In 1916, 300 buildings burned down in the city centre, and in 1955 parts of {{lang|no|Bryggen}} burned down.

===Toponymy===
Bergen is pronounced in English {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜːr|g|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɛər|g|ən}} and in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] {{IPA-no|ˈbærɡn̩||Bergen.ogg}}. The [[Old Norse]] forms of the name were ''{{lang|non|Bergvin}}'' and ''{{lang|non|Bjǫrgvin}}'' (and in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]] the city is still called ''{{lang|is|Björgvin}}''). The first element is {{wikt-lang|non|berg}} (n.) or ''{{lang|non|bjǫrg}}'' (n.), which translates to 'mountain(s)'. The last element is {{wikt-lang|non|vin}} (f.), which means a new settlement where there used to be a pasture or meadow. The full meaning is then 'the meadow among the mountains'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brekke |first=Nils Georg |title=Kulturhistorisk vegbok Hordaland |publisher=Hordaland Fylkeskommune |year=1993 |location=Bergen |language=Norwegian |page=252 |isbn=82-7326-026-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A suitable name: Bergen is often called 'the city among the seven mountains'. It was the playwright [[Ludvig Holberg]] who felt so inspired by the [[seven hills of Rome]], that he decided that his home town must be blessed with a corresponding seven mountains - and locals still argue which seven they are.

In 1918, there was a campaign to re-introduce the Norse form ''{{lang|non|Bjørgvin}}'' as the name of the city. This was turned down - but as a compromise, the name of the [[diocese]] was changed to ''{{lang|no|[[Diocese of Bjørgvin|Bjørgvin bispedømme]]}}''.&lt;ref name="bispedoeme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scandion.no/article/archive/826/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226020759/http://www.scandion.no/article/archive/826/ |archivedate=26 December 2007 |title=Bjørgvin bispedøme |accessdate=10 October 2007 |publisher=Scandion.no |year=2004 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:TettstedetBergen.jpg|thumb|Right|Bergen: Urban areas ([[Statistics Norway]])]]

Bergen occupies most of the peninsula of [[Bergenshalvøyen]] in the [[districts of Norway|district]] of [[Midthordland]] in mid-western Hordaland. The municipality covers an area of {{convert|465|km2|0|abbr=off}}. Most of the urban area is on or close to a fjord or bay, although the urban area has several mountains. The city centre is surrounded by the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although there is disagreement as to which of the nine mountains constitute these. [[Ulriken]], [[Fløyen]], [[Løvstakken]] and [[Damsgårdsfjellet]] are always included as well as three of [[Lyderhorn]], [[Sandviksfjellet]], [[Blåmanen]], [[Rundemanen]] and [[Kolbeinsvarden]].&lt;ref name="syvendehm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.no/kuriosa/article380762.ece |title=I den syvende himmel |accessdate=14 August 2007 |work=Bergens Tidende |year=2007 |author=Gunhild Agdesteen |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930041155/http://www.bt.no/kuriosa/article380762.ece |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gullfjellet]] is Bergen's highest mountain, at {{convert|987|m}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="wcpeaks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.westcoastpeaks.com/Peaks/gullfjellstoppen.html |title=Norwegian Mountains: Gullfjellstoppen |accessdate=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen is sheltered from the North Sea by the islands [[Askøy]], [[Holsnøy]] (the municipality of [[Meland]]) and [[Sotra]] (the municipalities of [[Fjell]] and [[Sund, Norway|Sund]]). Bergen borders the municipalities [[Meland]], [[Lindås]], and [[Osterøy]] to the north, [[Vaksdal]] and [[Samnanger]] to the east, [[Os, Hordaland|Os]] and [[Austevoll]] to the south, and [[Sund, Norway|Sund]], [[Fjell]], and [[Askøy]] to the west.

{{wide image|Bergen Panorama 001.jpg|850px|View of the city centre from Mt. Fløyen}}

==Climate==
[[File:Bergen vågsallmenningen rain.jpg|thumb|upright|Bergen on a rainy day]]
Bergen features a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Cfb). Bergen experiences plentiful rainfall in all seasons, with annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] measuring {{convert|2250|mm|in|abbr=on}} on average.&lt;ref name="nedboerstat"&gt;{{cite web

''Norsk vær i 110 år.'' N.W. DAMM &amp; Sønn. {{ISBN|82-04-08695-4}}; page 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergen's weather is warmer than the city's latitude (60.4° N) might suggest. Temperatures below -10 degrees Celsius are rare. Summer temperatures sometimes reach the upper 20s, but the city sees temperatures over 30 degrees only a few days each decade.

The high precipitation is often used in the marketing of the city, and features to a degree on postcards sold in the city. Compared to areas behind the mountains on the Scandinavian peninsula, Bergen is much wetter and has a narrower temperature range with cool summers and mild winters.

In recent years, precipitation and winds have increased in the city. In late 2005, heavy rains caused floods and several landslides, the worst of which killed three people on 14 September. Some indications are that, due to [[climate change]], storms causing landslides and floods will become more severe in the area and in the surrounding counties. As a response, the municipality created a special 24-man rescue unit within the fire department in 2005, to respond to future slides and other [[natural disaster]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Another concern is the risk of rising sea levels. Bryggen is already regularly flooded at extreme tides, and it is feared that as sea levels rise, floods will become a major problem in Bergen. Floods may in the future reach the railroad tracks leading out of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The immigrant population (those with two foreign-born parents) in Bergen, includes 42,169 individuals with backgrounds from 180 countries representing 15.5% of the city's population (2014). Of these, 50.2% have background from Europe, 28.9% from Asia, 13.1% from Africa, 5.5% from Latin America, 1.9% from North America, and 0.4% from Oceania. The immigrant population in Bergen in the period 1993-2008 increased by 119.7%, while the ethnic Norwegian population grew by 8.1% during the same period. The national average is 138.0% and 4.2%. The immigrant population has thus accounted for 43.6% of Bergen's population growth and 60.8% of Norway's population growth during the period 1993-2008, compared with 84.5% in Oslo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://statbank.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/Default_FR.asp?PXSid=0&amp;nvl=true&amp;PLanguage=0&amp;tilside=selecttable/hovedtabellHjem.asp&amp;KortnavnWeb=innvbef |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526191822/http://statbank.ssb.no/statistikkbanken/Default_FR.asp?PXSid=0&amp;nvl=true&amp;PLanguage=0&amp;tilside=selecttable/hovedtabellHjem.asp&amp;KortnavnWeb=innvbef |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Statistics Norway |publisher=Stat Bank |accessdate=4 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immigrant population in Bergen has changed a lot since 1970. As of 1 January 1986, there were 2,870 people with a non-Western immigrant background in Bergen. In 2006, this figure had increased to 14,630, so the non-Western immigrant population in Bergen was five times higher than in 1986. This is a slightly slower growth than the national average, which has sextupled during the same period. Also in relation to the total population in Bergen, the proportion of non-Westerns increased significantly. In 1986, the proportion of the total population in the municipality of non-Western background was 3.6%. In January 2006, people with a non-Western immigrant background accounted for 6 percent of the population in Bergen. The share of Western immigrants has remained stable at around 2% in the period. The number of [[Poles]] in Bergen rose from 697 in 2006 to 3,128 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bt.no/multimedia/archive/00321/Faktaark_321842a.pdf Immigrant population in Bergen]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city centre of Bergen lies in the west of the municipality, facing the fjord of [[Byfjorden (Hordaland)|Byfjorden]]. It is among a group of mountains known as the [[Seven Mountains, Bergen|Seven Mountains]], although the number is a matter of definition. From here, the urban area of Bergen extends to the north, west and south, and to its east is a large mountain massif. Outside the city centre and the surrounding neighbourhoods (i.e. [[Årstad, Bergen|Årstad]], inner [[Laksevåg]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]]), the majority of the population lives in relatively sparsely populated residential areas built after 1950. While some are dominated by [[apartment|apartment building]]s and modern [[terraced house]]s (e.g. [[Fyllingsdalen]]), others are dominated by [[single-family detached home|single-family home]]s.&lt;ref name="bl27"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=[[Bergen Byleksikon]]|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=27|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SkansenSeptember2007 2.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the city centre with [[Torgallmenningen]]]]
The oldest part of Bergen is the area around the bay of Vågen in the city centre. Originally centred on the bay's eastern side, Bergen eventually expanded west and southwards. Few buildings from the oldest period remain, the most significant being [[St Mary's Church, Bergen|St Mary's Church]] from the 12th century. For several hundred years, the extent of the city remained almost constant. The population was stagnant, and the city limits were narrow.&lt;ref name="bl23"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=23|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1702, seven-eighths of the city burned. Most of the old buildings of Bergen, including Bryggen (which was rebuilt in a mediaeval style), were built after the fire. The fire marked a transition from [[tar]] covered houses, as well as the remaining [[log home|log house]]s, to painted and some brick-covered wooden buildings.&lt;ref name="bl25"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=25|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last half of the 19th century saw a period of rapid expansion and modernisation. The fire of 1855 west of [[Torgallmenningen]] led to the development of regularly sized city blocks in this area of the city centre. The city limits were expanded in 1876, and [[Nygård, Norway|Nygård]], [[Møhlenpris]] and [[Sandviken, Norway|Sandviken]] were urbanized with large-scale construction of city blocks housing both the poor and the wealthy.&lt;ref name="bt_nygaardshøyden"&gt;{{cite news | first=Kjell | last=Østerbø | title=Da rike og fattige fikk sine strøk | date=23 September 2007 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article413890.ece | work=Bergens Tidende | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625091158/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article413890.ece | archivedate=25 June 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their architecture is influenced by a variety of styles; [[historicism (art)|historicism]], [[classicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name="bl2526"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=25-26|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wealthy built villas between Møhlenpris and Nygård, and on the side of Mount Fløyen; these areas were also added to Bergen in 1876. Simultaneously, an urbanization process was taking place in [[Solheimsviken]] in Årstad, at that time outside the Bergen municipality, centred on the large industrial activity in the area.&lt;ref name="bl2627"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=26-27|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The workers' homes in this area were poorly built, and little remains after large-scale redevelopment in the 1960s-1980s.

After Årstad became a part of Bergen in 1916, a development plan was applied to the new area. Few city blocks akin to those in Nygård and Møhlenpris were planned. Many of the worker class built their own homes, and many small, detached apartment buildings were built. After World War II, Bergen had again run short of land to build on, and, contrary to the original plans, many large apartment buildings were built in [[Landås]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Bergen acquired [[Fyllingsdalen]] from [[Fana (municipality)|Fana]] municipality in 1955. Like similar areas in Oslo (e.g. [[Lambertseter]]), Fyllingsdalen was developed into a modern suburb with large apartment buildings, [[Tower block|mid-rise]]s, and some single-family homes, in the 1960s and 1970s. Similar developments took place beyond Bergen's city limits, for example in [[Loddefjord]].&lt;ref name="bl961"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hagen Hartvedt|first=Gunnar|editor= |encyclopedia=Bergen Byleksikon|title=Bergen|url= |edition=1st|year=1994|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|id= |isbn=82-573-0485-9|oclc= |pages=9-61|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:06.05.25 16 Fra Nordnes i Bergen.JPG|thumb|200x200px|View from the Nordnes part of Bergen.]]
At the same time as [[New town|planned city]] expansion took place inside Bergen, its extra-municipal suburbs also grew rapidly. Wealthy citizens of Bergen had been living in Fana since the 19th century, but as the city expanded it became more convenient to settle in the municipality. Similar processes took place in [[Åsane]] and Laksevåg. Most of the homes in these areas are detached [[Terraced house|row house]]s, single family homes or small apartment buildings.&lt;ref name="bl961"/&gt; After the surrounding municipalities were merged with Bergen in 1972, expansion has continued in largely the same manner, although the municipality encourages condensing near commercial centres, future [[Bergen Light Rail]] stations, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="bt_fortetting1"&gt;{{cite news | first=Pål Andreas | last=Mæland | title=Nå kommer slangen til Paradis | date=16 May 2008 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112052521/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article564560.ece | dead-url=yes | archive-date=12 January 2013 | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bt_fortetting2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Eva |last=Røyrane |title=Bergen bygges tettere |date=9 May 2007 |url=http://bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |work=[[Bergens Tidende]] |accessdate=18 December 2008 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100820/http://www.bt.no/forbruker/husoghjem/article361530.ece |archivedate=7 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the modernisation wave of the 1950s and 1960s, and due to damage caused by World War II, the [[Local government|city government]] ambitiously planned redevelopment of many areas in central Bergen. The plans involved demolition of several neighbourhoods of wooden houses, namely [[Nordnes]], [[Marken, Bergen|Marken]], and [[Stølen, Bergen|Stølen]]. None of the plans was carried out in its original form; the Marken and Stølen redevelopment plans were discarded and that of Nordnes only carried out in the area that had been most damaged by war. The city council of Bergen had in 1964 voted to demolish the entirety of Marken, however, the decision proved to be highly controversial and the decision was reversed in 1974. Bryggen was under threat of being wholly or partly demolished after the fire of 1955, when a large number of the buildings burned to the ground. Instead of being demolished, the remaining buildings were restored and accompanied by reconstructions of some of the burned buildings.&lt;ref name="bl961"/&gt;

Demolition of old buildings and occasionally whole city blocks is still taking place, the most recent major example being the 2007 razing of Jonsvollskvartalet at [[Nøstet, Bergen|Nøstet]].&lt;ref name="bt_jonsvoll"&gt;{{cite news | first=Liv Solli | last=Okkenhaug | title=Rev de siste husene | date=21 April 2007 | url=http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | work=[[Bergens Tidende]] | accessdate=18 December 2008 | language=Norwegian | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427074218/http://www.bt.no/lokalt/bergen/article357421.ece | archivedate=27 April 2007 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clockwise, starting with the northernmost, the boroughs are [[Åsane]], [[Arna, Norway|Arna]], [[Fana]], [[Ytrebygda]], [[Fyllingsdalen]], [[Laksevåg]], [[Årstad, Bergen|Årstad]] and [[Bergenhus]]. The city centre is located in Bergenhus. Parts of Fana, Ytrebygda, Åsane and Arna are not part of the Bergen urban area, explaining why the municipality has approximately 20,000 more inhabitants than the urban area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Local borough administrations have varied since Bergen's expansion in 1972. From 1974, each borough had a politically chosen administration. From 1989, Bergen was divided into 12 health and social districts, each locally administered. From 2000 to 2004, the former organizational form with eight politically chosen local administrations was again in use and from 2008 through to 2010, a similar form existed where the local administrations had less power than previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lokaldemokratiets utvikling 1814 - 2014|url=https://www.bergen.kommune.no/omkommunen/avdelinger/byradsavd-for-klima-kultur-og-naring/2435/article-114765|website=Bergen kommune|accessdate=10 June 2016|language=Norwegian bokmål}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bergensk]] is the native dialect of Bergen and a variation of [[Vestnorsk]]. It was strongly influenced by [[Low German]]-speaking merchants from the mid-14th to mid-18th centuries. During the [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian period]] from 1536 to 1814, Bergen was more influenced by [[Danish language|Danish]] than other areas of Norway. The Danish influence removed the female [[grammatical gender]] in the 16th century, making Bergensk one of very few Norwegian dialects with only two instead of three grammatical genders. The Rs are [[uvular trill]]s, as in French, which probably spread to Bergen some time in the 18th century, overtaking the [[alveolar trill]] in the time span of two to three generations. Owing to an improved [[literacy rate]], Bergensk was influenced by [[Norwegian Bokmål|riksmål]] and bokmål in the 19th and 20th centuries. This led to large parts of the German-inspired [[vocabulary]] disappearing and pronunciations shifting slightly towards East Norwegian.&lt;ref name="slikblevi"&gt;{{cite book | title=Slik ble vi bergensere - Hanseatene og bergensdialekten| last=Nesse| first=Agnete|year=2003| publisher=Sigma Forlag| isbn=82-7916-028-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Madam Felle (1831-1908) monument in Sandviken, is in honour of a Norwegian woman of German origin, who in the mid-19th century managed, against the will of the council, to maintain a counter of beer. A well-known restaurant of the same name is now situated at another location in Bergen. The monument was erected in 1990 by sculptor Kari Rolfsen, supported by an anonymous donor. Madam Felle, civil name Oline Fell, was remembered after her death in a popular song, possibly originally a folksong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Davidsen |first= Knut B. |date= 7 December 2002 |title=Var madam Felle Jonnemann sin mor? |url= http://www.bt.no/nyheter/lokalt/Var-madam-Felle-Jonnemann-sin-mor-2406325.html#.UsJnmbmA2uo |trans-title=Was Madam Felle Jonnemann's Mother? |language= Norwegian Bokmål |newspaper= [[Bergens Tidende]] |location= Bergen, Norway |publisher= Media Norge, [[Schibsted]] |accessdate= 31 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Kjenner Dokker Madam Felle?" by [[Lothar Lindtner]] and [[Rolf Berntzen]] on an album in 1977.

Each year Bergen donates the [[Christmas tree|Christmas Tree]] seen in Newcastle's Haymarket as a sign of the ongoing friendship between the sister cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c26951/nyhet/vis.html?tid=74108&amp;strukt_tid=26951 |title=Æresborger av Newcastle |publisher=kongehuset.no |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nordic friendship cities of Bergen, [[Gothenburg]], [[Turku]] and [[Aarhus]] arrange inter-Nordic camps each year by inviting 10th grade school classes from each of the other cities to school camps. Bergen received a [[totem pole]] as a gift of friendship from the city of [[Seattle]] on the city's 900th anniversary in 1970. It is now placed in the [[Nordnes Park]] and gazes out over the sea towards the friendship city far to the west.

'''William Leonard "Bill" Gammage''' {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|AM|FASSA}} (born 1942) is an Australian academic historian, Adjunct Professor and Senior Research Fellow at the Humanities Research Centre of the [[Australian National University]] (ANU).
He was born in [[Orange, New South Wales]], went to [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]] High School and then to ANU.&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/hrc/people/staff_bios/gammagebio.php |title=ANU – Fellows – Gammage- HRC |work=anu.edu.au |date=11 June 2008 |publisher=Director, Humanities Research Centre |accessdate=22 April 2014 |author=HRC webmaster |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422080456/http://www.anu.edu.au/hrc/people/staff_bios/gammagebio.php |archivedate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the faculty of the [[University of Papua New Guinea]] and the [[University of Adelaide]]. He is a fellow of the [[Australian Academy of Social Sciences]] and deputy chair of the [[National Museum of Australia]].

==History studies==
===World War I===
Gammage is best known for his book ''The Broken Years: Australian Soldiers in the Great War'',&lt;ref name="PM's Award detail n shortlist"&gt;
{{cite news |title= PM's Award 2012 Shortlist |url= http://www.arts.gov.au/funding/awards/pmla/2012/shortlists/history/biggest-estate-on-earth |date= 30 May 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121027191602/http://arts.gov.au/funding/awards/pmla/2012/shortlists/history/biggest-estate-on-earth |archivedate= 27 October 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on his PhD thesis written while at the Australian National University. It was first published in 1974, and re-printed in 1975, 1980, 1981 (the year in which Peter Weir's film, ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' came out), 1985 and 1990. The study revives the tradition of [[C.E.W. Bean]], Australia's official historian of [[World War I]], who focused his narrative on the men in the line rather than the strategies of generals.{{citation needed|reason=who says this was CEW Bean's focus?—source?|date=July 2012}} Gammage corresponded with 272 Great War veterans, and consulted the personal records of another 728, mostly at the [[Australian War Memorial]].

He has written several other books about the experiences of soldiers in World War I, including three definitive books about Australian soldiers in the war. He also co-edited the ''Australians 1938'' volume of the ''[[Bicentennial History of Australia]]'' (1988).

===Aboriginal peoples planning and management of Australia===
In 1998, Gammage joined the Humanities Research Centre at the [[Australian National University|ANU]] as a senior research fellow for the Australian Research Council, working on the history of Aboriginal land management.&lt;ref name = "hrc"&gt;{{cite paper |author= Glen St John Barclay, Caroline Turner |title= A history of the first 30 years of the HRC at The Australian National University |version= |publisher= Humanities Research Centre, ANU |year= 2004 |url= http://epress.anu.edu.au/hrc/mobile_devices/ch06.html |accessdate= 2 July 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070622202156/http://epress.anu.edu.au/hrc/mobile_devices/ch06.html| archivedate= 22 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|isbn= 9780975122983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His scope was cross-disciplinary, working "across fields as disparate as history, anthropology and botany".&lt;ref name = "hrc"/&gt;

In the subsequent 13-year period he researched and wrote the book ''The Biggest Estate on Earth: How Aborigines made Australia'',&lt;ref name="Bush Telegraph radio interview"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = How Aborigines planned and managed Australia| url = http://www.abc.net.au/rural/telegraph/content/2011/s3336948.htm| accessdate = 8 July 2012| series = Bush Telegraph| credits = Greg Muller, Michael MacKenzie| network = Australian Broadcasting Corporation| station = Radio National| location = (nationwide)| airdate =11 Oct 2011 |time= 11:40&amp;nbsp;am (31:30 minutes) |transcript= Radio interview audio| transcripturl = http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/rural/telegraph/201110/r839214_7813039.mp3}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in October 2011.

'''Blick Mead''' is a chalkland spring in [[Wiltshire]] [[England]], with a constant temperature of around 11 degrees C so that it never freezes. It is close to an Iron Age hill fort known as [[Vespasian's Camp]] and about a mile from the [[Stonehenge]] ancient monument. Archaeology at the site conducted since 2005 shows human habitation going back to 10,000BP and to be continuous until 6000 BP. 35,000 worked flints and 2400 animal bones, some cooked, mostly from [[aurochs]], have been found at the site. There is also the remains of a pit dwelling. These have been used to radiocarbon date the time of settlement. It's clear that the site would have been an attractive place to camp or dwell with a spring that never freezes over. A rare algae called ''[[Hildenbrandia]]'' lives in the spring and it causes stones taken from it to turn bright red on exposure to air in a matter of hours. In [[Mesolithic]] times this could have given the place a magical significance. Its closeness to [[Stonehenge#Before the monument (8000 BC forward)|Stonehenge]] have led to theories that it is the original attraction that brought hunters to the area with the 'magic' colour changing stones giving the place a high spiritual significance in their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/vespasians-camp-cradle-of-stonehenge.htm|title=Vespasian’s Camp: Cradle of Stonehenge|date=2013-04-19|newspaper=Current Archaeology|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/research/hri/blickmead|title=The New Discoveries at Blick Mead: the Key to the Stonehenge Landscape|last=|first=|date=|website=www.buckingham.ac.uk|publisher=University of Buckingham|access-date=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/the-cradle-of-stonehenge-blick-mead-a-mesolithic-site-in-the-stonehenge-landscape|title='The Cradle of Stonehenge'?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3495">'''Cornelius Severin Scheel Schilbred''', often referred to as '''C. S. Schilbred''' (13 December 1906 – 10 April 1985) was a Norwegian genealogist, historian and educator. A school teacher and headmaster by occupation, he wrote extensively, and chaired the [[Norwegian Genealogical Society]] and the [[Norwegian Heraldry Society]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Eidanger]] as a son of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Cornelius Mathias Schilbred (1878–1949) and Marie Henriette Petersen (1885–1965). In 1939 he married Margrethe Lomsdal (1908–2000).&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2004|title=C S Schilbred|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Lars|last=Løberg|volume=8|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/C_S_Schilbred/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schilbred grew up in Eidanger and [[Oslo]]. He [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1925, enrolled in law studies and graduated with the [[cand.jur.]] degree in 1931. While studying he was an editor of the politically conservative periodical ''[[Minerva (Norwegian periodical)|Minerva]]'', and in 1928 a member of the board of the [[Norwegian Students' Society]]. In 1926, despite his young age, he was among the founders of the [[Norwegian Genealogical Society]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt; This was Norway's first national genealogical society.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.genealogi.no/NSF/om_NSF.htm|title=Norsk Slektshistorisk Forening|publisher=Norwegian Genealogical Society|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607043610/http://www.genealogi.no/NSF/om_NSF.htm|archivedate=7 June 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Schilbred spent his entire professional career as a teacher and headmaster in Oslo. In his spare time he had a considerable production of genealogical and local-historical works. He became a member of the board of the Norwegian Genealogical Society in 1952, served as vice chairman from 1957 and then chairman from 1968 to 1980. He edited its official periodical ''Norsk slektshistorisk tidsskrift'' from 1960 to 1967. He had formerly edited ''Tidsskrift for handelsutdannelse'' from 1948 to 1953, and also contributed to ''[[Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon]]'' and ''[[Store norske leksikon]]''. He also co-founded the [[Norwegian Heraldry Society]] in 1969. He was a member of the board from the start, vice chairman from 1970 and then chairman from 1973 to 1974. He also served as vice chairman of the [[Norwegian Society for the Protection of Animals]].&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Schilbred was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1977. He was an honorary member of the Society for the Protection of Animals. He died in April 1985 in Oslo.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6750">'''Domingo Francisco de San Antón Muñón Chimalpahin Quauhtlehuanitzin''' (1579, [[Amecameca]], [[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]]&amp;mdash;1660, [[Mexico City]]), usually referred to simply as '''Chimalpahin''' or '''Chimalpain''', was a [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] [[annals|annalist]] from [[Chalco (altepetl)|Chalco]]. His [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] names ({{IPA-nah|tʃiːmaɬˈpaː.in kʷaːʍtɬeːwaˈnitsin}}) mean "Runs Swiftly with a Shield" and "Rising Eagle", respectively, and he claimed descent from the lords of Tenango-[[Amecameca]]-[[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]].

He wrote on the [[history of Mexico]] and other neighboring nations in the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] and [[Spanish language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Gibson (historian)|Gibson, Charles]] and John B. Glass. "Prose sources in the Native Historical Tradition", article 27B. "A Census of Middle American Prose Manuscripts in the Native Historical Tradition". ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'' Part 4; ''Handbook of Middle American Indians''. University of Texas Press 1975, census #1023-1027,pp. 330-333.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important of his surviving works is the ''Relaciones'' or ''Anales''. This Nahuatl work was compiled in the early seventeenth century, and is based on testimony from [[indigenous peoples|Indigenous persons]]. It covers the years 1589 through 1615, but also deals with events before the Conquest and supplies lists of Indigenous kings and lords and Spanish viceroys, archbishops of Mexico and inquisitors. Chimalpahin recorded the 1610 and 1614 visits of [[Japan]]ese delegations to Mexico, led by [[Tanaka Shōsuke]] and [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]], respectively.

He also wrote ''Diferentes historias originales'' (also known as ''Relaciones originales''), a compilation of claims and proofs of nobility asserted by Indigenous leaders of Chalco-Amequemecan. It was written to serve as a judicial guide for the viceregal authorities for the granting of privileges and offices to members of the Indigenous nobility. There are eight of these ''relaciones''. All contain ethnographic, social and chronologic information of great value to historians.

His manuscripts came into the possession of [[Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora]]. For an account of what happened to these documents after the death of Sigüenza, see [[Lorenzo Boturini Benaducci]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">'''Eduard Mahler''', or '''Mahler Ede''' (September 28, 1857, [[Cífer]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] – June 29, 1945, [[Újpest]]) was a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[astronomer]], [[oriental studies|Orientalist]], [[natural scientist]].

He graduated from the Vienna public school in 1876, and then studied [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at the [[University of Vienna|Universität Wien]], taking his degree in 1880. From November 1, 1882, till the death of [[Theodor von Oppolzer|T. Oppolzer]] (December, 1886) Mahler shared in the latter's scientific [[Manual labour|labor]]s. On June 1, 1885, he was appointed assistant in the royal Austrian commission on measurement of degrees.

Mahler has devoted himself chiefly to [[chronology]]. In early life, he paid considerable attention to ancient Oriental history, [[Assyriology]], and [[Egyptology]], in which subjects he was a present private docent at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]]. On September 6, 1889, he received the royal medal ''[[Litteris et Artibus]]'' of Sweden and Norway; and since 1898 he has been an official of the [[Hungarian National Museum]].

The '''Estates of [[Lower Navarre]]''' ''(French: États de Basse-Navarre,&lt;ref name="Daranatz (1923), Part 1"&gt;Daranatz (1923), Part 1)]&lt;/ref&gt; Cortes de la Basse-Navarre)''&lt;ref name="Orpustan (n.d.), p. 9" /&gt; were first called into session on 28 August 1523&lt;ref name="Orpustan (n.d.), p. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daranatz (1923), Part 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Esarte Muniain (2001), p. 667"&gt;Esarte Muniain (2001), p. 667&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AD64, E 564"&gt;AD64, E 564 [http://earchives.le64.fr/ead.html?id=FRAD064003_IR0006&amp;c=FRAD064003_IR0006_de-566&amp;qid=eas1461344707935 (in French]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Henry II of Navarre|Henry II]] after [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|the definitive loss]] of [[Upper Navarre]],&lt;ref name="Lafourcade (2003), p. 608"&gt;Lafourcade (2003), p. 608 [http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/riev/48/48589619.pdf (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was created in the model of the Estates General that already existed in the Court of [[Pamplona#A fortress-city|Pamplona]], the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General of France]], and in [[Estates of Béarn|Béarn]] and other provinces.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade (2003), p. 608" /&gt; The last meeting of the Estates of [[Lower Navarre]] was on 15 June 1789.

== Composition ==

The '''Estates of [[Lower Navarre]]''' was composed of deputies from the three [[Estates of the realm#Kingdom of France|Estates]]: the First Estate ([[clergy]]), the Second Estate ([[French nobility|nobility]]) and the Third Estate ([[commoners]]), each deputy having one vote.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade (2003), p. 608" /&gt;

* For the First Estate, the [[regular clergy]], the [[Bishop of Bayonne]], the [[Bishop of Dax]], the [[Deanery|Dean]] of [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] and the [[Prior]]s of [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], [[Larceveau-Arros-Cibits|Utziate]] and [[Ostabat-Asme|Harambels]], six persons in all. The bishops rarely appeared. The [[Bishop of Bayonne]] was represented by the [[Archdeacon]] of ''[[Ostabarret|Pay de Cize]]'', who was the [[parish]] [[priest]] of [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]], and the [[Bishop of Dax]] by the [[Archdeacon]] of ''[[Ostabarret|Pays de Mixe]]'' and the ''[[Ostabarret|Pays d'Ostabarret]]'', who was the [[parish]] [[priest]] of [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]];&lt;ref name="Lafourcade (2003), p. 608" /&gt;
* For the Second Estate, the [[French nobility|nobility]], was composed of all of the owners of noble properties in [[Lower Navarre]], of which the number varied in the [[early modern period]] between 103 and 153, depending on the author. The relative number demonstrates the importance of the nobility in the small [[Lower Navarre|Kingdom of Lower Navarre]];&lt;ref name="Lafourcade (2003), p. 608" /&gt;
* For the Third Estate, the [[commoners]], the representation was quite complex due to the decentralized administrative structure of the country, composed of seven ''"lands"'' or valleys and five cities. Two of them, the ''[[Ostabarret|Pays de Mixe]]'' and the combined trilogy of [[Armendarits]]-[[Iholdy]]-[[Irissarry]] designated three representatives; the others, the ''[[Ostabarret|Pay de Cize]]'', the ''[[:fr:Arberoue (pays)|Pays d’Arberoue]]'', the ''[[Ostabarret|Pays d'Ostabarret]]'' and the ''[[:fr:Baïgorry-Ossès|Ossès]]'' and ''[[Vallée des Aldudes|Baïgorry]] Valleys'' nominated two; the five cities of [[La Bastide-Clairence]], [[Garris, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Garris]], [[Saint-Palais, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Saint-Palais]], [[Larceveau-Arros-Cibits|Larceveau]] and [[Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port]] each designated two. The representatives of the Third Estate were all attorneys, 26 in total for the Estates of Navarre.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade (2003), p. 609"&gt;Lafourcade (2003), p. 609 [http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/riev/48/48589619.pdf (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
The Estates of Navarre guaranteed that high-ranking officials of the Royal Council observed the requirements. On several occasions, the Estates filed complaints regarding the appointment of Royal Council and Chancery members. One complaint referred to the appointment of royal councillors and attorneys with no command of [[Basque language|Basque]].&lt;ref name="Orbea, J.M./Adot, A. (2014), p. 26"&gt;Orbea, J.M./Adot, A. (2014), p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

A first breach of the regulations and its related grievance referred to the ''affaire Jean de Laforcade'' in 1590, following his appointment as attorney general. He hailed from [[County of Foix|Foix]], so his appointment was appealed for failing to meet the birthplace and Basque language requirements. The General Courts (Estates) urged the king to remove him from office.&lt;ref name="Orbea, J.M./Adot, A. (2014), p. 26" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"(...) per no estar lo dict de la Forcade natural deu present reaume ni haver la inteligencia deu lengoadge basco, bulgar [customary] en aquel"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Estates guaranteed up to 1624 that the language standards remained in place. The [[Parliament of Navarre and Béarn|Parliament of Navarre]] with a seat in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] was then established out of a merger of the [[Chancery of Navarre|Chancery]] and [[Council of Navarre]] with the sovereign [[Council of Béarn]]; they ceased to exist. The new Parliament was then composed of a chief chairman, designated by the King, seven presiding deputies, two knights of honour, 46 councillors, two solicitors, and a general attorney.&lt;ref name="Orbea, J.M./Adot, A. (2014), p. 26" /&gt;

However, in the run-up to the 1624 dissolution of the Royal Council under Louis II ([[Louis XIII of France]]), a reform almost discarded the Basque language requirement citing certain edicts decreed by Henry III ([[Henry IV of France]]) which made any person of his choosing eligible for appointment to an office, "without difference of birth or religion", so that the preceptive [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]]se origin was never again mandatory either. The Three Estates accepted the new ruling, while at the same time demanding that Basque be mandatory for the councillors, except for one.&lt;ref name="Orbea, J.M./Adot, A. (2014), p. 28"&gt;Orbea, J.M./Adot, A. (2014), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The councillors had to be "versez en la langue basque, toutesfois y pourra avoir un conseiller ne sachant la dite langue"&lt;/ref&gt;
    
Despite the centralizing drive of the French crown, the Estates still kept significant legislating powers until 1748, when a decree by [[Louis XV of France]]  stripped them off.&lt;ref name="Lafourcade (2003), p. 616"&gt;Lafourcade (2003), p. 616&lt;/ref&gt; The archives of the ''Estates of Navarre'' for the period 1317–1789 are held at the Archives Départementales des Pyrénées-Atlantiques.&lt;ref name="AD64, États de Navarre"&gt;AD64, États de Navarre&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born September 27, 1933 in [[St. Boniface, Manitoba]] to George Wilfrid Goulet and Marie Alexina Laura McDougall, a granddaughter of [[Pierre Delorme]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mta.ca/acdc/news6.html |title=Mount Allison University Press Release |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318184206/http://www.mta.ca/acdc/news6.html |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; George was the fifth of eight children. He counts amongst his ancestors early [[French Canadian]] settlers [[Louis Hebert]], [[Jean Guyon]] du Buisson and [[Zacharie Cloutier]] in addition to political figure [[Alexander Macdonell of Greenfield (politician)|Alexander MacDonell of Greenefield]] and [[John Siveright]], Chief Factor of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].&lt;ref&gt;The Saint Boniface Historical Society, Ancestors of George R. D. Goulet, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the father of five children including [[Tag Goulet]], [[Laura de Jonge]] and [[Catherine Goulet]].

George attended [[St. Paul's High School (Winnipeg)|St. Paul's High School]] in [[Winnipeg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpauls.mb.ca/images/alumni_finder/sphs_class_of_1951.pdf.pdf|title=Alumni Class List - Class of '51 |accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from the [[University of Manitoba]], a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Manitoba [[Law School]], and a Master of Laws degree from the [[University of Toronto]]. The admissions guide for the University of Toronto lists George as one of four distinguished alumni along with Astronaut [[Roberta Bondar]], Sociologist [[Daniel G. Hill|Daniel G Hill]] and Simon Cooper, former President and COO of the [[Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/Documents/Admissions_Guide.pdf |title=University of Toronto School of Graduate Studies Admission Guide |accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George is the author of several historical books including ''The [[Trial of Louis Riel]]: Justice and Mercy Denied''; ''The [[Métis people (Canada)|Metis]]: Memorable Events and Memorable Personalities''; and ''[[Louis Hebert]] and Marie Rollet: Canada's Premier Pioneers'' (the last two with his wife [[Terry Goulet]] as co-author). Together they have spoken at numerous schools, universities, libraries, and public events &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccmc.cwahi.net/terryandgeorgegoulet.html
|title=CCMC Metis Summit April 16, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; including at the Manitoba Pavilion during the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver BC|Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://umanitoba.ca/people/alumni/media/OnMB_Aug2011_web.pdf |format=PDF|title=On Manitoba magazine, August 2011 p. Sec2:35 |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2012 they spoke at the Centre of Canadian Studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cst.ed.ac.uk/Events/OpenResearch/Spring2012/index.html|title=Canadian Studies Centre Events - Open Research Seminars|accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[British Association of Canadian Studies]] conference on Sustaining Canada at [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|Murray Edwards College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] where they gave a talk on the Aboriginal rights of the Métis in relation to the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/canadian-studies.org/bacs2012/home/programme
|title=BACS conference program|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 George and his wife Terry were commissioned by the [[Métis Nation British Columbia|Metis Nation of British Columbia]] to write a book about the history of the Métis people within [[British Columbia]] in honour of the [[BC 150]] celebration. The book, ''The Metis in British Columbia: From Fur Trade Outposts to Colony'', was officially released at the [[Annual General Meeting]] of the Métis Nation of British Columbia in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnbc.ca/pdf/MNBC%202008%20AGM%20minutes%20-%20Sep%2026-28%20-%20draft.pdf |format=PDF |title=BC Metis Nation Press Release |accessdate=2008-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706185521/http://www.mnbc.ca/pdf/MNBC%202008%20AGM%20minutes%20-%20Sep%2026-28%20-%20draft.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they were the Historical Consultants to the [[BC Metis Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bcmetis.com/wp-content/uploads/George-and-Terry-Goulet-Outline-Senate-Metis-Identity-Report.pdf |title=Senate of Canada Committee Report on Métis Identify |accessdate=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in September 2008 George was one of the featured speakers at the commemoration of the [[Elzéar Goulet]] Memorial Park in Saint Boniface. George is a great-grand-nephew of the Métis martyr for whom the park was named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-258598606.html |title=The Story of Elzear Goulet |accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An annual scholarship, the George and Terry Goulet Bursary in Canadian History, was established at the [[University of Calgary]] in their honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/pubs/calendar/current/awards-ug-details-2.html |title=University of Calgary Undergraduate Awards Detail |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Scholarships/G/George-and-Terry-Goulet-Bursary-in-Canadian-History.html |title=Canada's Higher Education and Career Guide |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George, along with his wife Terry, is a strong supporter of the [[exoneration]] of Louis Riel and has been quoted on his support of the [[Private member's bill#Canada|Private member's bill]] introduced by [[Pat Martin]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aborigin.sasktelwebhosting.com/Resources/January_2011.pdf |title=Justice for Louis Riel requires exoneration |author=Eagle Feather News |accessdate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2011 in an article appearing in the [[National Post]], in which Martin argues that Riel was a hero and not a traitor, Martin refers to Goulet's book title in that Riel's [[Louis Riel#Execution|execution]] was "a case of both justice and mercy denied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nationalpost.com/todays-paper/hero+traitor/4736838/story.html |title=A hero, not a traitor |author=National Post Newspaper |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2012 George and his wife Terry spoke before a [[Canadian Senate Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples|Standing Committee]] of the [[Senate of Canada]] to examine and report on the legal and political recognition of Métis identity in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/SenCommitteeBusiness/Notice.aspx?parl=41&amp;ses=1&amp;comm_id=1&amp;Language=E&amp;meeting_id=13275|title=Senate Committees Notice of Meeting |author=Parliament of Canada website |accessdate=2012-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global War on Terrorism Service Medal''' ('''GWOT-SM''') is a [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military award]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]] which was created through [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 13289 on 12 March 2003, by President [[George W. Bush]]. The medal recognizes those military service members who have supported operations to counter terrorism in the [[War on Terror]] from [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001]], to a date yet to be determined.

==Background==
In September 2002, the U.S. Department of Defense sent a request to the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry]] to provide a design for a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. In January 2003, a design was completed, which was then approved and made official in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15313&amp;CategoryId=4&amp;grp=4&amp;menu=Decorations%20and%20Medals&amp;ps=24&amp;p=0 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012020220/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/Heraldry.aspx?HeraldryId=15313&amp;CategoryId=4&amp;grp=4&amp;menu=Decorations%20and%20Medals&amp;ps=24&amp;p=0 |archive-date=12 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal will cease being awarded when [[s:Proclamation 7463|Presidential Proclamation 7463]], "Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain Terrorist Attacks", delivered on 14 September 2001, is terminated by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Department of Defense|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Military_Decorations_and_Awards_Review_Results_%28January_2016%29.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331001605/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Military_Decorations_and_Awards_Review_Results_%28January_2016%29.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 March 2017|work=Military Decorations and Awards Review Results|title=Campaign, Expeditionary, and Service Medals|quote=30.

The Coast Guard awards the medal for different operations ([[#Coast Guard|'''qv''']]).&lt;ref name="USGC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coast Guard Medals and Awards manual |url=http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/1000-1999/CIM_1650_25D.pdf |work=COMDTINST M1650.25D |publisher=United States Coast Guard |accessdate=7 January 2016 |date=May 2008 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
To receive the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, a military service member must have served on active duty during a designated anti-terrorism operation for a minimum 30 consecutive or 60 non-consecutive days. For those who were engaged in combat, killed, or wounded in the line of duty the time requirement is waived.&lt;ref name="GWOTSM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Defense Manual 1348.33, Volume 2|url=http://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/134833v2_dodm_2016.pdf|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |accessdate=13 September 2017|pages=36–37|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afpc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="578.32"/&gt;

The initial authorized operation for the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal was the so-called "Airport Security Operation" which occurred between 27 September 2001 and 31 May 2002. Additional operations, for which the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal is authorized, include the active military campaigns of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], [[Operation Noble Eagle]], and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]].&lt;ref name="afpc"/&gt;  Future operations are at the discretion of United States component commanders upon approval from the [[United States Department of Defense]].&lt;ref name="578.32"&gt;{{cite web|title=§ 578.32 Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.|url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/32cfr578.32.htm |work=Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 – National Defense|publisher=US Government Printing Office|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support duty===
In 2004, Defense Department and military service branches began publishing directives, messages, and orders, specifying that the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal would be awarded not only for direct participation in specific operations, but also to any personnel who performed support duty of an anti-terrorism operation but did not directly participate.&lt;ref name="afpc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afpc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7813|title=Global War on Terrorism Service Medal|publisher=US Air Force Personnel Center|work=|accessdate=30 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402152046/http://www.afpc.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=7813|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "support" was further defined as any administrative, logistics, planning, operational, technical, or readiness activity, which provides support to an operation of the Global War on Terrorism. As a result of this blanket term, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal became an eligible award for most personnel of the United States Armed Forces who performed service after 11 September 2001 through March 2004.

With the orders granting the GWOT-SM for "support duty", the medal has essentially become almost the same type of award as the [[National Defense Service Medal]] and graduates of training schools, [[ROTC]], and [[service academy|service academies]] are typically presented both awards at the same time.  The primary difference between the NDSM and the GWOT-SM is that the NDSM is automatic as soon as a person joins the military whereas the GWOTSM may only be presented after thirty days of active duty in a unit (or three months in the case of the Reserve Component). The regulations for Reservists and National Guardsmen are also not as well defined for the GWOT-SM as they are for the NDSM, since the presentation of the NDSM to reservists and National Guardsmen was codified and clarified as far back as the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]].

===Army===
The U.S. Army's regulations state that all soldiers "on active duty, including Reserve Component Soldiers [''sic''] mobilized, or Army National Guard Soldiers [''sic''] activated on or after 11 September 2001 to a date to be determined having served 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days are authorized the GWOTSM."
The GWOT-SM was awarded automatically to all service members on Active Duty between 11 September 2001 and 31 March 2004. While the award is no longer automatic, the termination "date to be determined" has not been set. The Battalion Commander is the approval authority for the GWOT-SM. Service members are still eligible for the medal provided they meet the criteria in AR 600-8-22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Army Regulation 600–8–22|url=http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf|work=Personnel-General, Military Awards|publisher=United States Army Publishing Directorate|accessdate=21 January 2016|page=36|date=25 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722181345/http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r600_8_22.pdf|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Army soldiers serving on active duty primarily in a training status (basic training, advanced individual training, officer training courses, etc.…) are not authorized award of the GWOT-SM for the active duty time they are in training.  The criteria for the awards specifically states that a Soldier has to serve on active duty in support of a designated GWOT operation (Operation Noble Eagle ["ONE"], Operation Enduring Freedom ["OEF"], Operation Iraqi Freedom ["OIF"], Operation New Dawn ["OND"], Operation Inherent Resolve ["OIR"], and Operation Freedom's Sentinel ["OFS"]) for 30 consecutive days or 60 nonconsecutive days.

==Devices (none)==
Only one award of this medal may be authorized for any individual, no bronze or silver {{frac|3|16}} inch [[service star]]s are prescribed for second or subsequent awards.&lt;ref 
 name="GWOTSM"/&gt;

;Battle stars
Although qualifying circumstances would be extremely rare, bronze {{frac|3|16}} inch [[battle star]]s were applicable for personnel who were engaged in actual combat against the enemy involving grave danger of death or serious bodily injury. Only a [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Command]] could initiate a request for a GWOT-SM (or [[Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal]]) battle star. This request would have contained the specific unit(s) or individual(s) engaged in actual combat, the duration for which combat was sustained, and a detailed description of the actions against the enemy. The [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] was the approving authority for the specific battle stars.

To date there have been no battle stars authorized for the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. The Military Decorations and Awards Review Results released in January 2016 resolved to "eliminate authority for battle stars" in regard to the GWOT-SM.&lt;ref&gt;item #29, [http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/Military-Decorations-and-Awards-Review-Results.pdf Military Decorations and Awards Review Results], [[Department of Defense (United States)|Department of Defense]], January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin of the name===
There are at least six narratives of the origin of the city’s Belarusian name. One of the more plausible is that the name is derived from the name of the stream Homeyuk, which flowed into the [[Sozh river|river Sozh]] near the foot of the hill where the first settlement was founded. Names of other Belarusian cities are formed along these lines: for example, the name [[Minsk]] is derived from the river Menka, [[Polatsk]] from the river [[Palata River|Palata]], and [[Vitsebsk]] from the river Vitsba.
In historical sources from 1142{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} to the 16th century, the city is mentioned as Hom', Homye, Homiy, Homey, or Homyi. These forms are tentatively explained as derivatives of an unattested ''*gomŭ'' of uncertain meaning.&lt;ref&gt;''Этимологический словарь славянских языков: праславянский лексический фонд,'' под ред. О.Н. Трубачева, вып.7 (Москва, 1980), стр.21.&lt;/ref&gt;
The modern name for the city has been in use only since the 16th–17th centuries.

During the Soviet period, another story about the city's name was popular: raftsmen on the river Sozh supposedly warned each other about the danger of running into sandy shallows by shouting «Ho! Ho! Mel!». A more recent narrative, propagated by some modern researchers, is that the name is derived from an ancient Belarusian greeting: «Dats u homel», which means «to pat on the shoulder».{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Gomel under [[Kievan Rus']]===
[[File:Gomel inner fortress in the 12th century.jpg|thumb|left|190px| Gomel's inner fortress in the 12th century]]
Gomel was founded at the end of the 1st millennium AD on the lands of the [[East Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] tribal union of [[Radimichs]]. It lays on the banks of the [[Sozh river]] and the Homeyuk stream. Sozh's high right bank, cut through by canyons, provided a natural fortification. For some time, Gomel was the capital of the Gomel Principality, before it became part of the [[Principality of Chernigov]]. Gomel is first mentioned in the [[Hypatian Codex]] under the year of 1142 as being territory of the princes of Chernigov. For some time, Gomel was ruled by the prince of Smolensk [[Rostislav Mstislavich]] before it was re-captured by [[Iziaslav III Davidovich]], after whose death it belonged to [[Sviatoslav Olgovich]] and then to Sviatoslav's son Oleg. Under Oleg, Gomel went to the Principality of [[Novhorod-Siverskyi]]. The next ruler was [[Igor Svyatoslavich]] – the hero of "[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign]]". During this period, the town was a fortified point and the centre of a [[volost]]. In the 12th–13th centuries the city's area was not less than 40 ha, and it had developed various crafts and was connected by trading routes with the cities of Northern and Southern Rus'. Archeological data have shown that the city was badly damaged during the Mongol-Tatar assault in the first half of the 13th century.

===Gomel in the Great Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth===
[[File:Gomel fortress in the 16th century.gif|thumb|left|230px| Gomel fortress in the 16th century]]
In 1335, the Gomel region was joined to the [[Great Duchy of Lithuania]] by [[Algirdas]]. From 1335 to 1406 it was under the ownership of prince Patricia Narymuntovich and his sons, from 1406 to 1419 the city was ruled by the Great Duke's deputies, from 1419 to 1435 it belonged to prince [[Svitrigaila]], from 1446 to 1452 to prince Vasiliy Yaroslavich, from 1452 to 1483 to [[Mozhaysk]] prince Ivan Andreyevich, and from 1483 to 1505 to his son Semyon, who transferred it to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].

During the Second [[Muscovite-Lithuanian War]] of 1500–1503 Lithuania tried to regain Gomel and other lands transferred to Moscow, but suffered defeat and lost one-third of its territory. In 1535, Lithuanian and Polish forces under [[Jerzy Radziwiłł]], [[Jan Tarnowski]] and Andrzej Niemirowicz re-captured the city after the surrender of Moscow's deputy, D. Shchepin-Obolensky. In the same year, the Great Duke of Lithuania [[Sigismund Kęstutaitis]] founded the Gomel [[Starostwo]]. According to the peace agreement of 1537, Gomel together with its [[volost]] remained a Lithuanian possession. In 1535–1565 Gomel is the centre of [[starostwo]], and from 1565 onwards Gomel is in the [[Rechytsa]] [[Powiat]] of the [[Minsk Voivodeship]].

[[File:Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560.gif|thumb|right|100px| Coat of Arms of Gomel, 1560]]
In 1560, the city's first [[coat of arms]] was introduced. In 1569, Gomel became part of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. From this moment on, the city became the arena of numerous attacks and battles between [[Cossaks]], Russia and the [[Polish-Lithuania Commonwealth]]. In 1572, Gomel [[Starostwo]] was given to B. Sapega. At the beginning of the 1570s, Gomel was captured by the forces of [[Ivan the Terrible]], but in 1576 it was re-captured by J. Radziwiłł. In 1581, Gomel was again attacked by Russian troops, and in 1595–1596 it was in the hands of [[Severyn Nalyvaiko]]'s [[Cossaks]].

After the beginning of the struggle against [[Orthodox Christianity]] in Lithuania, [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Nikolayevskiy Cathedral was closed on the order of [[Greek Catholic]] [[Eparch]] [[Josaphat Kuntsevych]] in 1621. In 1633 the city was besieged by the [[Cossaks]] of Bulgakov and Yermolin, in 1648 captured by the Golovatskiy's Cossack detachment, and in 1649 by Martyn Nebaba's detachment. After that, Gomel got through several sieges in 1651 but in 1654 was captured by Ivan Zolotarenko's detachment. He and his sons held the city until 1667 and then began to serve under [[Alexis of Russia]], however, after the [[Truce of Andrusovo]] Gomel at last returned to the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where it first belonged to [[Mikołaj Krzysztof "the Orphan" Radziwiłł|M. K. Radziwiłł]] and then – till the [[annexation]] by the [[Russian Empire]] – to the [[Czartoryski family]]. During the [[Great Northern War]] Russian forces under [[Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov]] stood in Gomel. In 1670, Gomel got the [[Magdeburg rights]]. Towards the middle of the 17th century, the city fell into crisis mainly due to the struggles mentioned above. It suffered significant damage, the population decreased severely, and many crafts disappeared.

The period when Gomel was part of the [[Russian Empire]] was marked by rapid growth of the population, urban infrastructure, and industrial capacity.
[[File:Homiel. Гомель (1799).jpg|thumb|right|230px| Map of Gomel in 1799]]

Gomel became part of the [[Russian Empire]] after the first partition of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772 and was confiscated by the imperial treasury. In 1775, [[Catherine the Great|Empress Catherine II]] gave Gomel and Gomel eldership in the eternal hereditary possession of Russian military commander [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]].

The Peter and Paul Cathedral, designed by architect John Clark, was built in 1809–1819. [[Nikolay Rumyantsev]] opened the first high school, hotel courtyard, glass, tile, distilleries, weaving and spinning factories, and he built a church, a synagogue, a pharmacy, a hospice and a permanent wooden bridge across the [[Sozh river]].

After the death of Nikolay Rumyantsev, the city came in possession of his brother Sergei Petrovich Rumyantsev. However, due to lack of money, Sergei indebted Gomel with the state treasury of the [[Russian Empire]]. Subsequently, after not being able to pay off the debt, the treasury sold the city. [[Gomel Palace|Gomel palace]] was acquired by Prince [[Ivan Paskevich]], and the rest of the city by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1838). Paskevich had an English garden made around the palace, which is still in place today. In 1856, the estate passed on to his son Fyodor Ivanovich Paskevich.

By 1913, Gomel was a major industrial city and counted 104.500 inhabitants.

=== Ukrainian period ===
Following the [[treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], in 1918 the city was liberated from Bolshevik troops by German forces. The city became part of [[Chernihiv Governorate]] of the [[Ukrainian State]].

=== Soviet period ===
On 14 January 1919, Gomel was occupied by the Red Army, leading to a major revolt. Insurgents took control of strategic objects and executed members of the Soviet leadership of the city. The rebels were defeated.

In 1919, Gomel became the centre of the [[Gomel Governorate]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. After the end of the hostilities, restoration of industry and transport began. In the 1920s, a number of large businesses had been created: shipyards, a factory named "Polespechat", a shoe factory named "Trud", a bakery, and the first phase of a municipal power plant. In 1926 the city was passed to the [[Belarusian SSR]].

By 1940, 264 industrial enterprises had been established

===World War II===
During [[World War II]], Gomel was under Nazi occupation from [[Operation Barbarossa|August 19, 1941]] until the [[Battle of the Dnieper|November 26, 1943]]. The city was liberated by [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokossovsky]]'s [[1st Belorussian Front|Belorussian Front]] during the Gomel-Rechitsa Offensive. Eighty percent of the city was destroyed. The population of Gomel had dropped dramatically. According to the data of the registry, the population of Gomel numbered less than 15,000 of inhabitants, compared to 144,000 inhabitants in 1940.

=== The post-war period ===
After the war, restoration of Gomel began promptly. The majority of pre-revolutionary buildings were lost. City streets were considerably expanded, and buildings in [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist Empire style]] were erected. In 1950, almost all of the pre-war enterprises resumed their work.

===Chernobyl disaster===
As a result of the catastrophe at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl nuclear power plant]] on 26 April 1986, Gomel suffered [[radioactive contamination]]. This significantly worsened both the ecological situation and the socio-economic crisis that had struck the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the late 1980s. It caused a sharp decline in living standards and a gradual depopulation that lasted until the early 21st century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

At the beginning of the 21st century, a scientific centre and practice for radiation medicine and human ecology was built in Gomel to overcome and study the consequences of the catastrophe at Chernobyl. [https://web.archive.org/web/20160606185834/http://www.rcrm.by/english/main.html]

The development of radiological dose values varies between individual villages in severely contaminated regions, depending on the surroundings and the economic orientation. In general, life is possible in these areas today, even in some parts of formerly closed-off zones, if appropriate behavioural rules are observed.&lt;ref&gt;Petro Zoriy, Herbert Dederichs, Jürgen Pillath, Burkhard Heuel-Fabianek, Peter Hill, Reinhard Lennartz: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Burkhard_Heuel-Fabianek/publication/311846655_Long-Term_Measurements_of_the_Radiation_Exposure_of_the_Inhabitants_of_Radioactively_Contaminated_Regions_of_Belarus_-_The_Korma_Report_II_1998_-_2015/links/585d2ecd08ae329d61f68de7.pdf ''Long-Term Measurements of the Radiation Exposure of the Inhabitants of Radioactively Contaminated Regions of Belarus – The Korma Report II (1998 – 2015)''] Verlag [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]] 2016, {{ISBN|978-3-95806-181-1}}. PDF, 10,6 MB&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of the Republic of Belarus ===
On 27 July 1990, the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was drafted. Gomel became a city in the independent state of the Republic of Belarus.

In the first half of the 1990s, Gomel, like the whole of Belarus, was struck by an acute socio-economic crisis: living standards fell sharply, the death rate exceeded the birth rate, the volume of industrial production fell sharply, and the crime rate increased. From 1996 onwards the situation in the country and in Gomel began to stabilize and improve gradually.

In 2013, the city's population numbered 515,325,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://belstat.gov.by/homep/ru/indicators/regions_current_data/vol_1/11.pdf |title=Belstat.gov.by |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403195647/http://belstat.gov.by/homep/ru/indicators/regions_current_data/vol_1/11.pdf |archivedate=3 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating a positive population growth and hence a reversal of the demographic crisis that began in 1993.

====Jewish community====

After the annexation of Gomel by the [[Russian Empire]] and the creation of the [[Pale of Settlement]], Gomel gradually became a centre of resettlement for the Jewish population of Russia. According to the 1897 census, 55% of the population of Gomel were [[Jews]]. In 1903, there was a violent [[pogrom]] against the Jewish population of the city. From that moment on, a gradual decrease of the number of Jews in the city began. 40,880 Jews lived in Gomel in 1939, when they comprised 29.4 percent of the total population. Most Jews had left the city in anticipation of German occupation, but still between 3,000-4,000 Gomel Jews fell victim to the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="YV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/untoldstories/database/index.asp?cid=323 |publisher=Yad Vashem |title=The murder sites of the Jews in the occupied territories of the former USSR: Gomel |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s saw [[History of the Jews in Belarus#Late 20th century to modern days|mass emigration]] of Jews from Gomel, but at the same time restoration of Jewish institutions in the city by the remaining Jewish inhabitants.&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/homyel/gomel_history.html |publisher=Paul Zoglin |title=Gomel history |date=2009-12-16 |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

Gomel is situated in the southeastern part of the country, on the right bank of the [[Sozh river|river Sozh]], {{convert|302|km|0|abbr=on}} south-east of [[Minsk]], {{convert|534|km|0|abbr=on}} east of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]], {{convert|171|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Mogilev]], {{convert|237|km|0|abbr=on}} west of [[Bryansk]] and {{convert|111|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Chernihiv]].

The terrain on which the city as a whole is built, is flat. On the right bank of the river, it is a gradually decreasing plain water-glacial and [[fluvial terrace]] of the [[Sozh River|Sozh river]]. The left bank is a low-lying alluvial plain. The highest elevation of 144 meters above sea level is found at the northern outskirts of Gomel, the lowest elevation of 115 m at the water boundary Sozh river. Novobelitskiy district, which is located on the left bank of the river (i.e., towards the south), has elevations averaging of 10–15 meters lower than the northern and central parts of the city.

On the left bank of the Sozh many kilometers of beaches can be found.

===Climate===
The climate of Gomel is moderate and continental. Warm summers and cold winters are caused by frequent arrival of warm sea air masses from the Atlantic and the dominating western transfer.

==Transportation==
The public transportation system consists of over 1,000 buses and [[trolleybus]]es. Over 210 million passenger rides were registered in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorod.gomel.by/page.aspx?module=text&amp;page_id=70&amp;section_id=97 |title=Gomel Transportation Statistics (Russian language) |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-12-13 |accessdate=2014-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213171337/http://www.gorod.gomel.by/page.aspx?module=text&amp;page_id=70&amp;section_id=97 |archivedate=13 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taxicab|Taxi]] services ($10 for a one-way intra-city ride) are available 24 hours a day. The city is an important railroad hub in the southeastern part of Belarus, as it is situated midway on the [[Minsk]]-[[Kiev]] rail link. The strategic location of Gomel near the border with Russia and Ukraine provides a direct connection to the vast railroad networks of those countries.

A trolleybus network opened on 20 May 1962 and consists of 23 routes (not counting variations). On 15 December 2010, after constructing an overhead wire network in the streets of Egorenko, Sviridov and Chechersk, a new trolley line opened to the terminus "Neighborhood Klinkowski" that resulted in a change of trolleybus routes 9, 16, 17. The length of the network is about {{convert|74|km|0|abbr=on}} and the total length of trolleybus routes is {{convert|475|km|0|abbr=on}}. Rolling stock consist of types [[ACSM-201]], [[ACSM-321]], ACSM-213, ACSM-101, ZIU-682.
There are more than 60 bus routes totaling 670 kilometers, and a number of express routes. Rolling stock consists mainly of buses MAZ-105, MAZ-107, MAZ-103 and Ikarus 280, and to a lesser extent MAZ-104, MAZ-203, MAZ-206, and since 2014, the extra-large-capacity, low-[[MAZ-215]]. Express routes use Rodemich-A type buses. The 24 minibus lines use Ford Transit, GAZelle, Mercedes-Benz, and Peugeot vans.

[[Gomel Airport]] is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} north-east of the city.

== Sports ==
To overcome the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and to improve the health of the population, the government has paid considerable attention to sports and sports facilities.{{clarify|date=July 2016}}

Gomel is home to a wide range of sports facilities that have been developed and improved in recent years. These facilities, including eight stadiums and the Ice Palace, which has two ice arenas, support common activities such as hockey, track and field, and football (American Soccer). The [[Central Stadium (Gomel)|Central Stadium]] is the home of Gomel’s local football club, [[FC Gomel]]. Gomel hosts multiple international competitions in these facilities, the annual “Bells of Chernobyl” competition being one of the many.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gomel-region.by/en/sport-en/|title=Gomel Oblast Tourism and sport {{!}} Gomel region {{!}} Gomel|website=www.gomel-region.by|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sports facilities, Gomel has a multitude of [[Olympic Reserve School]]s, which is more commonly referred to as sports schools.

Many of Gomel's sports schools prepare athletes from a young age. Numerous champions have been trained by schools such as these. For example, one school, Gomel’s Olympic Reserve Number 4, has trained 97 World and European champions as well as two Olympic athletes. Gomel State College of Olympic Reserve, on the other hand, trains coaches rather than athletes. From this school, 44 graduates have participated in the Olympics, European championships, and World championships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Gomel also participates in the [[Deaflympics]] and, between the years 2007-2009, has been awarded: two gold medals, one silver medal, and two bronze medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gomel.belstu.by/gomel_en.html|title=УО "Гомельский государственный политехнический колледж" - официальный Web-сайт|website=gomel.belstu.by|access-date=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Since 1990, [[P.O. Sukhoy Homiel State Technical University]] and [[Gomel State Medical University]] have attracted many international students from countries around the world, including the United States, Germany, China, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Syria, Russia, Ukraine, Egypt, Iran and countries in Latin America. Gomel State Medical University provides classes in both English and Russian. Many prominent scientists work here as senior lecturers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5857">'''Hargrave Jennings''' (1817-1890) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], [[Rosicrucian]], author on [[occultism]] and [[esotericism]], and amateur student of [[comparative religion]].  

==Phallism and Phallicism==

In several voluminous works, Jennings developed the theory that the origin of all religion is to be sought in [[phallus|phallic]] worship of the [[Sun]] and [[Agni|fire]], which he described as "phallism."  

In addition to the works to which he affixed his own name, Jennings is thought by some researchers to have written a number of anonymous volumes in the privately printed "Nature Worship and Mystical Series" series, and possibly also to have written under the pseudonym "Sha Rocco." 

As Jennings made clear in several of his books, he used the word "phallic" in its non-gendered sense, meaning "having to do with the sexual organs"; thus he included worship of the female genitalia under the heading of "phallic." In later editions he reluctantly acceded to popular (although incorrect) usage and called his subject "phallicism."

== Criticism == 
[[Helena Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]] disagreed with Jennings' thesis of phallicism being the origin of all religion.&lt;ref name="phallicism"&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, "Buddhism, Christianity And Phallicism", in ''THEOSOPHICAL ARTICLES'' By H. P. Blavatsky, The Theosophy Company, reprint 1982&lt;/ref&gt; 

Blavatsky writes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is quite true that the origin of every religion is based on the dual powers, male and female, of abstract Nature, but these in their turn were the radiations or emanations of the sexless, infinite, absolute Principle, the only One to be worshipped in spirit and not with rites; whose immutable laws no words of prayer or propitiation can change, and whose sunny or shadowy, beneficent or maleficent influence, grace or curse, under the form of Karma, can be determined only by the actions--not by the empty supplications--of the devotee. '''This was the religion, the One Faith of the whole of primitive humanity." '''&lt;ref name="phallicism"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;She suggests her own thesis of the birth of phallicism.

However she also praised highly his earlier book The Rosicrucians, as well as paying him due credit with such quotes as:

"How well Hargrave Jennings expresses himself when speaking of Pyramids, and how true are his words when he asks: "Is it at all reasonable to conclude, at a period when knowledge was at the highest, and when the human powers were, in comparison with ours at the present time, prodigious, that all these indomitable, scarcely believable physical effects — that such achievements as those of the Egyptians — were devoted to a mistake? that the myriads of the Nile were fools laboring in the dark, and that all the magic of their great men was forgery, and that we, in despising that which we call their superstition and wasted power, are alone the wise? No! there is much more in these old religions than probably — in the audacity of modern denial, in the confidence of these superficial-science times, and in the derision of these days without faith — is in the least degree supposed. We do not understand the old time. . . . .""&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Blavatsky, "Isis Unveiled", Vol. 1, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henry Reynolds''' {{postnominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|FAHA|FASSA}} (born 1 March 1938) is an eminent Australian historian whose primary work has focused on the frontier conflict between [[European settlement of Australia|European settlers in Australia]] and [[indigenous Australians]].

==Education and career==
Reynolds received a state school education in [[Hobart]], Tasmania, from 1944 to 1954. Following this, he attended the [[University of Tasmania]], where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in History in 1960, later gaining a Master of Arts in 1964. He gained his PhD in History from [[James Cook University]] in 1970. He received an [[Doctor of Letters|Honorary Doctor of Letters]] degree from his alma mater, the University of Tasmania, in 1998.

He then taught in secondary schools in Australia and England, later establishing the Australian History programme at [[James Cook University|Townsville University College]], where he accepted a lectureship in 1965, later serving as an Associate Professor of History and Politics from 1982 until his retirement in 1998. He then took up an [[Australian Research Council]] post as a professorial fellow at the [[University of Tasmania]] in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], and subsequently a post at the University's Riawunna Centre for Aboriginal Education. He currently serves as Honorary Research Professor in the University's School of Humanities.

Henry Reynolds is married to [[Margaret Reynolds]], an [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for Queensland in Federal Parliament (1983 until 1999).

==Historical research==
{{main article|History wars}}
In more than ten books and numerous academic articles Reynolds has demonstrated the results of his meticulous research and explained the high level of violence and conflict involved in the colonisation of Australia, and the Aboriginal resistance to numerous massacres of indigenous people. Reynolds, and other historians, estimate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html |title=The Statistics of Frontier Conflict |publisher=Kooriweb.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that up to 3,000 Europeans and at least 20,000 [[indigenous Australians]] were killed directly in the [[Australian frontier wars|frontier violence]], and many more Aborigines died indirectly through the introduction of European diseases and starvation caused by being forced from their productive tribal lands.

[[Geoffrey Blainey]] and [[Keith Windschuttle]] categorise his approach as a "black armband view" of Australian history. Reynolds has been quoted as responding to this claim as follows - better a black armband than a white blindfold. His books are based on a vast stock of evidence, available in archives and recorded during frontier times, and have been instrumental in overturning previously held views prevalent in the late 20th Century that settlement was peaceful. He has also however shown that in earlier times  - pre 1900 - white Australians were well aware of the violence against the aborigines and believed they were a 'dying race'.

In 2002, historian and journalist, Keith Windschuttle, in his book ''The Fabrication of Aboriginal History, Volume One: Van Diemen's Land 1803–1847'', disputed whether the colonial settlers of Australia committed widespread [[genocide]] against Indigenous Australians, especially focussing on the [[Black War]] in Tasmania, and denied the claims by historians such as Reynolds and Professor [[Lyndall Ryan]] that there was a campaign of guerrilla warfare against British settlement. He accused Reynolds of inventing evidence and making many claims without any documentary support at all. Subsequently, in ''Whitewash: on Keith Windschuttle's fabrication of Aboriginal history'' it was argued that Windschuttle failed to meet the criteria that he used to assess 'orthodox historians' and thus his accusations of deliberately and extensively misrepresenting, misquoting, exaggerating and fabricating evidence were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editorlink=Robert Manne| editor-last=Manne|editor-first=Robert | title=Whitewash: on Keith Windschuttle's fabrication of Aboriginal history |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=o0cSAQAAIAAJ&amp;q| publication-date=2003 | publisher=Black Inc | isbn=978-0-9750769-0-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Friendship with Eddie Mabo==
Reynolds struck up a friendship with [[Eddie Mabo]], who was then a groundsman and gardener at [[James Cook University]]. In his book ''Why Weren't We Told?'', Reynolds describes the talks they had regarding Mabo's people's rights to their lands, on [[Murray Island, Queensland|Murray Island]], in the [[Torres Strait]]. Reynolds writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Eddie [...] would often talk about his village and about his own land, which he assured us would always be there when he returned because everyone knew it belonged to his family. His face shone when he talked of his village and his land.

So intense and so obvious was his attachment to his land that I began to worry about whether he had any idea at all about his legal circumstances. [...] I said something like: "You know how you've been telling us about your land and how everyone knows it's Mabo land? Don't you realise that [[terra nullius|nobody actually owns land on Murray Island]]? It's all crown land."

He was stunned. [...] How could the whitefellas question something so obvious as his ownership of his land?&lt;ref name=W188&gt;Reynolds, Henry, ''Why Weren't We Told?'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-14-027842-7}}, p.&amp;nbsp;188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reynolds looked into the issue of indigenous land ownership in international law, and encouraged Mabo to take the matter to court. "It was there over the sandwiches and tea that the first step was taken which led to [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|the Mabo judgement in June 1992]]."&lt;ref name=W188 /&gt; Mabo then talked to lawyers, and Reynolds "had little to do with the case itself from that time",&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Henry, ''Why Weren't We Told?'', 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;191&lt;/ref&gt; although he and Mabo remained friends until the latter's death in January 1992.

'''Historicity''' in [[philosophy]] is the idea or fact that something has a historical origin and developed through history: concepts, practices, values. This is opposed to the belief that the same thing, in particular [[normative]] [[institution]]s or correlated [[ideology|ideologies]], are [[nature|natural]] or [[essence|essential]] and thus exist [[Cultural universal|universally]].

Historicity relates to the underlying concept of [[history]], or the intersection of [[teleology]] (the concept and study of progress and purpose), [[temporality]] (the concept of time), and [[historiography]] ([[semiotics]] and history of [[history]]). Varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events.{{cn|date=October 2013}}

== Concepts of historicity ==
In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], historicity is the history of constitution of any [[intentionality|intentional]] object, both in the sense of history as [[tradition]] and in the sense where every individual has its own history. Of course, these two senses are often very similar: One individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in, but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition. In addition, personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition.

[[Martin Heidegger]] argued in ''[[Being and Time]]'' that it is temporality that gives rise to history. All things have their place and time, and nothing past is outside of history. [[Ingo Farin]] agues that Heidegger appropriated the concept from [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] and from [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg]] &lt;ref&gt;Farin, Ingo. "Three levels of historical analysis in early Heidegger." The New Yearbook for Phenomenology and Phenomenological Philosophy XII XII (2013): 1-37.&lt;/ref&gt; and further clarifies Heidegger's meaning: 

: ''Heidegger calls authentic historicity the historical awareness that recognizes this whole range (i.e., the “simultaneity” of past, present, and future in the historical action one resolves to undertake).''

[[Francis Fukuyama]], in ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'', famously argued that the collapse of [[Soviet communism]] brought humanity to the "end of history" whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism.

Before Fukuyama, [[Jean Baudrillard]] argued for a different concept of the "end of history". Baudrillard's most in-depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books ''Fatal Strategies'' and ''The Illusion of the End''. It is for these writings that he received a full-chapter denunciation from the physicist [[Alan Sokal]] (along with [[Jean Bricmont]]), due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time, space and stability. In contrast to Fukuyama's argument, Baudrillard maintained that the "end of history", in terms of a [[teleology|teleological]] goal, had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress, civilisation and rational unification. And this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the 20th century, brought about by the "speed" at which society moved, effectively "destabilising" the linear progression of history (it is these comments, specifically, that provoked Sokal's criticism). History was, so to speak, outpaced by its own spectacular realisation. As Baudrillard himself caustically put it:

:''The end of history is, alas, also the end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for disposing of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history,'' this is because History itself has become a dustbin. ''It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Baudrillard, ''The Illusion of the End'', 1994, p. 26; also in Jean Baudrillard, ''Selected Writings'', 2001, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach to history is what marks out Baudrillard's affinities with the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] philosophy of [[Jean-François Lyotard]]: the idea that society — and Western society in particular — has "dropped out" of the grand narratives of history (for example, the coming of Communism, or the triumph of civilised modern society). But Baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that, although this "dropping out" may have taken place, the global world (which in Baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a [[universal humanity]]) is, in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself, condemned to "play out" this illusory ending in a hyper-teleological way — acting out the end of the end of the end, ''ad infinitum''. Thus Baudrillard argues that — in a manner similar to that of [[Giorgio Agamben]]'s book ''Means without Ends'' — Western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist.

[[Michel-Rolph Trouillot]] offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of historicity. Trouillot explains, "The ways in which what happened, and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical".

'''Isa-Beg Ishaković''' ({{lang-tr|İshakoğlu İsa Bey}}; {{floruit}} 1439–70) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] general and the governor of the [[Sanjak of Bosnia]] for most of his career. Of Bosnian noble origin, he was recruited after being held hostage by the Ottomans. He was a provincial governor during the 1450s and 1460s, first in charge of the [[Sanjak of Skopje]], and then the Sanjak of Bosnia. He was instrumental in the Ottoman conquests in the region, and was one of the Sultan's most trusted generals.

==Origin==
There are two main theories about his identity:
*'''Isak Hranić Kosača''', the brother of [[Kingdom of Bosnia|Bosnian]] nobleman [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača]], who was sent to the sultan [[Mehmed II]] as hostage and guarantee of Kosača's loyalty. After being adopted by [[Ishak-Beg]] (hence the surname Ishaković) he was converted into [[Islam]] and had by contemporary measures a significant military and political career within the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Suljovic&gt;Suljović 2010: {{quote|Ta dvojenja idu u smjeru&amp;nbsp;– da je riječ o bratu Stjepana Vukčića Kosače, koji ga je predao Mehmedu II kao garanciju lojalnosti. Po ovoj teoriji Isa-beg je, nakon što ga je usvojio Ishak-beg (otud prezime), konvertirao na islam, te za ondašnje prilike izgradio zavidnu vojničku i političku karijeru. Po drugima, Isak Hranić/Hranušić zarobljen je tijekom jednog upada akindžija na posjed velikaške obitelji Pavlović, inače gospodara velikog dijela Istočne Bosne, uključujući i srednjovjekovnu župu Vrhbosnu. U zarobljeništvu se dokazao kao izuzetno sposoban, što je vođu spomenutih akindžija potaknulo da mu ostavi imetak, ali i poziciju koju je obnašao. Potpuno drukčiji pristup na porijeklo Ishakovića imaju istraživanja historičarke umjetnosti Lidije Bogojević Kumbaradži iz Skoplja. Ona smatra da je rodonačelnik Ishakovića Pašajigit-beg iz Saruhana (Kapadokije), a da je Ishak-beg bio njegov sin. Zanimljivosti idu do mjere u kojoj se skopski begovi Kumbaradžije smatraju izravnim potomcima Isa-bega Ishakovića, o čemu posjeduju i autentičnu dokumentaciju. Iznad ulaza u nekadašnji bazar u Skopju, građevine koju je podigao Ishaković, stoji ploča o obnovi bazara. Natpis kazuje da su bazar obnovili begovi Kumbaradžije, nasljednici Isa-begov}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Isak Hranić/Hranušić''', taken prisoner when the ''akinci'' intruded a holding of the [[Pavlović noble family]] (lords of eastern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], including the ''[[župa]]'' of [[Vrhbosna]]). He proved himself exceptionally able while a prisoner, so the ''akinci'' leader freed him (prompted him to leave the property, as well as his title).&lt;ref name=Suljovic/&gt;

==Life==
Isa-Beg Ishaković was appointed as ''[[sanjak-bey]]'' (provincial governor) of the [[Sanjak of Skopje]] in the spring of 1439, in place of his adoptive father, [[Ishak-Beg]], who was sent to lead military actions in [[Serbian Despotate|Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Godišnjak|year=1953|page=46|publisher=Društvo Istoričara Bosne i Hercegovine|location=Sarajevo, SFR Yugoslavia|language=Serbo-Croatian|quote=To se najbolje vidi iz sadržine vijesti na osnovu koje znamo za njihovu prisutnost u Bosni 1438 godine, a još bolje iz činjenice da se u proljeće sljedeće godine ovdje pojavio novi skopski sandžakbeg Isa-beg, sin dotadašnjeg skopskog sandžaka Ishak bega koji je bio upućen na akcije u Srbiji}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then appointed the ''sanjak-bey'' of Bosnia, briefly in 1463, and then from 1464 to 1470.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

As governor of the province of Bosnia, Isa-Beg assured its future prosperity. He founded [[Sarajevo]] in 1461{{cn|date=September 2017}} in the former Bosnian province of Vrhbosna. Between then and 1463 he built the core of the city's [[Stari Grad, Sarajevo|Old Town district]], including a [[mosque]], a closed marketplace, a public bath, a hostel, and the Governor's castle (''Saray''), which gave the city its present name. In much the same way and year he also founded [[Novi Pazar]] (in Serbia), rendered from {{lang-tr|Yeni Pazar}}, literally meaning "new marketplace", some eleven kilometers from the medieval settlement of Trgovište. There he built a mosque, a marketplace, a public bath, a hostel, and a compound. He is also responsible for establishing a number of other cities and towns in the region.

Ishaković built many important buildings part of the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]] in [[Skopje]], like the [[Čifte Hammam]], [[Kapan Han]], [[Ishak Bey Mosque]] (dedicated to his father [[Ishak-Beg]], also known as Isaklija or Aladža), the [[madrasa]] (Islamic school) and [[library]] (within Isak-Beg's Mosque, one of the first Islamic libraries in Europe),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://search.theeuropeanlibrary.org/portal/en/libraryTreasures.html?libraryid=43 |title= AT-TAFSĪR AL-KABĪR|author= |date= |work= |publisher= The European Library |accessdate=23 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many other buildings that belonged to his endowment (''[[waqf]]'', {{lang-sh|vakuf}}). 

Ishaković participated in ransom slavery in 1470 when he ransomed a highly positioned Ottoman official named Mustafa by releasing the wife of Croatian nobleman Ivan Marković and paying 500 ducats to [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] [[Frančesko Micalović]], the agent in this transaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hodžić|first=Muamer |title=Foča-Dubrovnik: Živan Pripčinović (?-1479): Život jednog dubrovačkog trgovca i „diplomate“ u Bosni |date=2015-10-12|website=focanskidani |publisher=|url=https://focanskidani.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/foca-dubrovnik-zivan-pripcinovic-1479-zivot-jednog-dubrovackog-trgovca-i-diplomate-u-bosni-foto/|quote=Naime, dogovoreno je da Isa-beg Ivanu vrati ženu i plati dodatnih 500 dukata kako bi dobio natrag Mustafu.

'''John Walter MacDonald Bannerman''' (13 August 1932 – 8 October 2008) was a Scottish historian, noted for his work on Gaelic Scotland.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Balmaha]], Stirlingshire, the son of [[John Bannerman, Baron Bannerman of Kildonan|John MacDonald Bannerman]], later Lord Bannerman of Kildonan, and his wife Ray Mundell. His family were native speakers of [[Scottish Gaelic]], and Bannerman studied [[Celtic languages]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] and completed his doctorate at the [[University of Cambridge]] where he was taught by [[Kathleen Hughes (historian)|Kathleen Hughes]].

Although he considered teaching Gaelic in schools, Bannerman instead took up a post at the Celtic department of the [[University of Aberdeen]] before joining the history department at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1967. He took over the running of the family farm at Balmaha in 1968, shortly before his father's death, dividing his time between teaching at the University, writing and farming.

His work on Gaelic Scotland was influential. His early works on [[Dál Riata]], the [[Senchus fer n-Alban]] and the [[Iona]] chronicles which formed part of the later ''[[Chronicle of Ireland]]'' are contained in his 1974 book ''Studies in the History of Dalriada''. He was a major contributor to the record of ''Late Medieval Monumental Sculpture in the West Highland'' published in 1977 and his study of the [[Beaton medical kindred|Beaton family]]—''The Beatons: Medical Kindred in the Classical Gaelic Tradition''&amp;mdash;appeared in 1986. In his latter years he worked on the history of the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]]. He retired from teaching in 1997 and took up farming full-time at Balmaha.

Bannerman married Chrissie Dick in 1959. They had five children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">'''Jon Jakobsen Venusinus''' (c. 1558 &amp;ndash; 1608) was a Danish theologian, naturalist and historian. 
He was born on the [[Ven (Sweden)|island of Ven]] as the son of the local pastor, Jakob Jonsen. 
The father was transferred to [[Landskrona]] in 1563, where Jon Jakobsen assumed the surname ''Coronensis'', which he changed to ''Venusinus'' after the island of Ven became widely known due to the observatories built there by [[Tycho Brahe]].
He visited the school at Frederiksborg, and later studied in Copenhagen and Rostock. In 1579 [[David Chytræus]] recommended him to [[Frederick II of Denmark|Frederick II]], who granted him an annuity to support his studies.
Venusinus spent some years travelling in Europe, visiting Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Italy, and completed a master's degree in Wittenberg.
Returning to Denmark, he was made parish priest in Herfølge and Sædder and dean of Bjæverskov Herred in 1584, a position in which he was succeeded by [[Claus Christoffersen Lyschander]] in 1587.

Venusinus married  Agathe, the daughter of professor John Sascerides  in 1585, and after the death of his first wife in 1589 he married Karine Dankertsdatter, widow of canon Hans Leiel in Roskilde. It appears that both marriages remained childless, but he adopted the son of his second wife, Dankert Leiel.

The position in Herfølge was one of the most lucrative in the country, but Venusinus appears to have preferred life in the capital, and he moved to Copenhagen in 1587 where he was made pastor of the [[Church of the Holy Ghost, Copenhagen|Church of the Holy Ghost]]. He was accused of holding [[Crypto-Calvinism|Crypto-Calvinist]] sympathies, due to his refusal to perform [[Minor exorcism in Christianity#Lutheranism|baptismal exorcism]],  and he was suspended from office in 1588. He petitioned [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian VI]] to abolish baptismal exorcism; his request was not granted, but in a partial success for Venusinus, the king himself had one of his children baptized without the ceremony.

Although Venusinus was not on good terms with the Copenhagen academy, he was appointed professor of physics (i.e. natural sciences) "by royal command" in 1600, under which title he undertook the construction of a [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden|botanical garden]].
He was among the first at Copenhagen University to accept the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican worldview]] and he held lectures on magnetism. After the deafh of [[Niels Krag]] in 1602, he was also appointed [[Historiographer Royal (Denmark)|Royal Historian]]. In 1603 he switched from the chair of physics to that of rhetoric and held lectures on Danish antiquity (''Antiquitates rerum Danicarum''). In 1606 he accompanied Christian IV to England on the king's visit to  his brother-in-law&lt;!--[[Anne of Denmark]]--&gt; [[James I of England]], where his erudition attracted considerable attention.
In 1607, Venusinus was endowed with [[Soro Abbey]], which allowed him to retire from all paid academic work, and he intended to focus on compiling a history of Denmark, but he died, around the age of fifty, on 30 January of the following year.

'''Joseph ben Joshua ben Meïr ha-Kohen''' (also '''Joseph HaKohen''', '''Joseph Hakohen''' or '''Joseph Hacohen''') (20 December 1496 in [[Avignon]], France &amp;ndash; 1575 or shortly thereafter, [[Genoa]], Italy) was a historian and physician of the 16th century.

==Life==
Joseph's family originally lived at [[Cuenca, Spain]]. When the Jews were expelled from Spain the family settled at Avignon. At the age of five Joseph left Avignon with his father and went to [[Genoa]], where they remained until 1516. Driven from that city, they went to [[Novi Ligure|Novi]], but returned to Genoa in 1538, where Joseph practiced medicine for twelve years. On June 3, 1550, he and all his coreligionists were driven from Genoa as a consequence of the rivalry of the non-Jewish physicians. Joseph then settled at [[Voltaggio]], at the request of the citizens of that small town, practicing there until 1567. When the Jews were driven out of the territory of Genoa, he went to Costeletto ([[Montferrat]]), where he was very well received. In 1571 he was again established at Genoa, where he died a few years later.

Joseph ha-Kohen had three sons (Joshua, Isaac, Judah) and two daughters. As for his brother Todros, he has tentatively been identified by Robert Bonfil with Ludovico Carretto, who is known to have converted from Judaism. Joseph ha-Kohen was highly regarded as a historian and physician. One of his chief concerns was also the release of the many Jewish captives taken by the vessels of the Italian republics and by the [[Barbary pirates|Corsairs]]; as in 1532, when [[Andrea Doria]] captured many Jews on taking [[Koroni|Coron]], [[Patras]], and [[Zante]]; in 1535, when the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] took [[Tunis]]; in 1542, when the galleys of [[Cegala Visconti]] had imprisoned a number of Jews.

==Historical works==
In Hebrew literature Joseph ha-Kohen achieved prominence by two historical works. His major work, ''Dibre ha-Yamim le-Malke Zarfat we-'Otoman'' (Chronicles of the Kings of France and Turkey), is in the nature of a history of the world, in the form of annals, in which he represents the sequence of events as a conflict between Asia and Europe, between [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], the protagonist for Islam being the mighty [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish empire]], and for Christianity, France. With these two great groups he connects European history, beginning with the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|downfall of the Roman empire]]. In this he also includes narratives of persecutions of Jews during the first and second crusades, copied from eye-witness reports available to him in manuscript. The work was printed in 1554 at Venice but later put on index (Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin). It was reprinted in Amsterdam in 1733. Parts were translated into German and French; the entire work was issued in English, but badly translated, by Bialloblotzky. He continued, however, the work on it, as is evident from autographs preserved in British Library.

He undoubtedly tried to be a careful historian. He gathered his facts from all possible sources, made notes, kept registers, and conducted a wide correspondence. He added continually to the first redaction of his works, carefully dating each one. Of his second chronicle ''Emeq ha-Bakha'' (The Vale of Tears) he thus made at least four updated editions. Yet his style is monotonous, although he tries to write in a biblical style. Having lived in Italy from his childhood and become acquainted with persons prominent politically, he is a valuable source for the history of his time; concerning many events, he had examined witnesses. He also mentions a number of important facts ignored by other historians. He is less accurate in the treatment of ancient history, for which he often was obliged to consult untrustworthy sources.

==The Jewish Annals==
His  second chronicle is an extract from his world chronicle of items concerning persecutions of the Jews. To this he added material from [[Samuel Usque]]'s ''Consolaçam as Tribulaçoens de Ysrael'' (1557), the chronicle of [[Abraham ibn Daud]]  as well as other material that had reached him, calling it ''Emeq ha-Bakha'' (The Vale of Tears). Its set purpose in the introduction to the book was to serve as reading on the fast of 9 Av. There he dwells upon the sorrows and sufferings the Jews endured in various countries in the course of centuries. The book, which is a martyrology from beginning to end, closes with the 24th of Tammuz, 5335 AM (1575 CE). The tenor of the book makes it an out-spoken representative of "the lachrymose conception of Jewish history" ([[Salo Baron]]).

Joseph ha-Kohen finished the first version of this work in 1558, at [[Voltaggio]]. Another version was finished in 1563, a third version ca 1565, and the fourth and final version in 1575. It circulated in Italy in manuscript and was edited for the first time by [[Samuel David Luzzatto]] and published in 1852 by [[Max Letteris]]. In 1858 M. Wiener published a German translation. A modern text-critical edition, edited by Karin Almbladh, appeared in 1981.

Joseph ha-Kohen wrote also a Hebrew version, with the title ''Meqitz Nirdamim'', of [[Meïr Alguadez]]'s Spanish medical work giving prescriptions for the healing of various diseases; to these prescriptions he added some of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Comp. [[Johann Christoph Wolf]], ''Bibliotheca Hebræa'', iv.853 ''et seq.''; [[Moritz Steinschneider]], in Berliner's ''Magazin'', x.166; Steinschneider, ''Hebräische Übersetzungen'', p. 775; Steinschneider, in ''Jewish Quarterly Review'' xv.137)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
Less known is his work upon the New World. In his world-chronicle there is a reference to [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] (whom, however, he confounds with [[Amerigo Vespucci]]); the work is very meager in its information.&lt;ref&gt;Harrisse, in ''Centralblatt für Bibliothekswesen'', 1888, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; After writing it he became acquainted with [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia General de las Indias'' and [[Joan Boemus]]'s ''Omnium Gentium Mores Leges et Ritus''. From these, in 1557, he compiled his ''Matztib Gebulot 'Ammim'' (Who Setteth the Boundaries of Nations),&lt;ref&gt;See Deuteronomy xxxii.6&lt;/ref&gt; a history of the conquest of Mexico, to which he added a full account of the discoveries of Columbus. This work was published in 2002 by Moshe Lazar.

A small work of a different kind was his ''Peles ha-Shemot'', written in 1561, containing an alphabetical list of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] nouns, with scripture illustrations of their occurrence given for the purpose of fixing their gender &amp;mdash; a matter in which (as he says) "many writers in Hebrew erred." He also compiled, in 1567, a book of polite formulas to be used in addressing letters, and a large number of verses, which are found, written in his own hand, at the end of his works. A large number of letters, evidently meant to serve as models, are found in the MSS. Rabbinowicz, No. 129 (now in Budapest and edited by Abraham David in 1985). Two-thirds of these are by Joseph ha-Kohen; they give a good insight into his private life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3717">'''Marie Jayne Kuda''' (1940–2016) was an American writer, lecturer, publisher, and historian of LGBT culture in Chicago. Her collection contained over 100,000 documents and ephemera and her research extended to LGBT culture from ancient times through the 20th century. In 1991, she was inducted into the first class of the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame. She was the founder of Womanpress, published the first annotated bibliography of lesbian literature, ''Women Loving Women'', and organized five Lesbian Writers' Conferences in Chicago.

== Early life ==
Marie Jayne Kuda was born in Chicago. As a child, she had osteomyelitis, an infection of the leg bone, and received a bone marrow transplant at the age of 8.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/marie-j-kuda-top-historian-of-chicago-lgbt-culture-dies-at-76/|title=Marie J.

After her father's death, Kuda got her own apartment at 15 and later worked her way through DePaul University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She held a variety of jobs, including graphic artist, house painter, and cook, as well as in bookstores and as a bookkeeper. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glhalloffame.org/index.pl?item=10&amp;todo=view_item|title=Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame|website=www.glhalloffame.org|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her life, Kuda created an archive of over 100,000 documents, matchbooks, buttons, and other ephemera to tell the story of LGBT culture in Chicago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1978, she began giving slide presentations to share the contributions that lesbians and gay men had made to mainstream culture. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although she never received a library degree, she was an outspoken member of the Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daring to Find Our Names: The Search for Lesbigay Library History|last=Carmichael|first=James Vinson|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1998|isbn=9780313299636|location=Westport, CT|pages=105|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied [[anthropology]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] (1889–94), engaged in field work under [[Frederic Ward Putnam|F. W.

He also became director of an important private museum in New York, the [[Museum of the American Indian]] ([[Heye Foundation]]).  Saville conducted many explorations to various places such as [[Yucatan]], Honduras, Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia.

'''Music archaeology''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study field that combines [[musicology]] and [[archaeology]]. As it includes music from numerous cultures, it is often seen as being a part of [[ethnomusicology]], and indeed a study group looking into music archaeology first emerged from ethnomusicological group the ICTM, not from within archaeology.

==Definitions==

"In its broadest sense, music archaeology is the study of the phenomenon of past musical behaviours and sounds", as music archaeologist Adje Both connects several definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Arnd Adje Both, Music Archaeology: Some Methodological and Theoretical Considerations, in: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/i25735471 Yearbook for Traditional Music, Vol. 41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513001609/https://www.jstor.org/stable/i25735471 |date=13 May 2018 }}, 2009, published by the [http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology ICTM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219215540/http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology |date=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Music archaeologists use methods of both musicology and archaeology. A theoretical and methodological basic work is still missing and one of the desiderata of the international community of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Eichmann, [http://www.dainst.org/de/profile/ricardo-eichmann?ft=all Einführung in die Musikarchäologie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413221402/http://www.dainst.org/de/profile/ricardo-eichmann?ft=all |date=13 April 2014 }}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different goals in music archaeology: One of the most important is the exploration of excavated artefacts that are relevant for the reconstruction of ancient music, such as sound-producing devices, representations of musical scenes and textual evidence. The archaeological analysis and documentation of such artefacts, their dating and description as well as the explanation of find contexts and cultural contexts can shed light on its use and function in everyday life of the past, and can help us to rebuild them - i.e., to construct playable replicas.
To produce music in a broader sense may also mean the investigation of early musical notations and literary sources that are "excavated" in libraries or other hidden places. These results may illuminate how instruments were played or how music was sung. But ultimately what was played in ancient times must remain in the dark of the past, and much fantasy is needed by modern musicians to imagine how melodies and rhythms may have been composed. Strictly speaking, only the sound of the instruments can be revived - these are the possibilities and limits of Music Archaeology.
In the last few years the field has expanded considerably, with the inclusion of neurophysiological, biological, and psychological research. These approaches explore the possible beginnings of sound production by seeking the earliest prerequisites in the evolution of mankind for music making and musical 'understanding'.
At the other end of the continuum, newly published evidence for musical notations and theoretical writings, or new literary and iconographic sources relevant to ancient music, can add to our understanding of mostly vanished music cultures. The observation and integration of ethnographic analogies in recent or contemporary societies may also help us discover long lasting traditions in making music which are comparable to the silent past.

==History==

A first attempt to join the two distinct disciplines of Musicology and Archaeology took place at the conference of the International Musicological Society at Berkeley in 1977. One of the round tables was designated "Music and Archaeology", to which were invited specialists to discuss the musical remains of ancient cultures - Bathia Bayer (Israel), Charles Boilès (Mexico), Ellen Hickmann (Egypt), David Liang (China), Casja Lund (Scandinavia). The main stimulus for this was the sensational discovery of an ancient Mesopotamian musical system by Anne D. Kilmer, assyriologist in Berkeley. On the basis of this she was able to advance a decipherment and transcription into Western notation of a late Bronze Age hymn in the Hurrian language, excavated from Ugarit, which contained notation based on the Mesopotamian system. With the help of musicologist Richard L. Crocker (Berkeley) and instrument maker Robert Brown, a replica of a Sumerian lyre was made, and Kilmer's version of the Hurrian hymn was recorded, accompanied by a carefully prepared commentary, as Kilmer/Crocker/Brown, Sounds from Silence, Recent Discoveries in Ancient Eastern Music (LP with information booklet, Bit Enki Publications, Berkeley, 1976). At the round table in Berkeley, Kilmer explained their method of reconstruction and demonstrated the resulting sound. This was the starting point of the [http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology], officially founded within the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) in Seoul/Korea in 1981, and recognized by the ICTM in New York in 1983 following its first meeting on current music-archaeological research in Cambridge/UK in 1982.

The ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology went on to hold international conferences in Stockholm (1984), Hannover/Wolfenbüttel (1986), Saint Germain-en-Laye (1990), Liège (1992), Istanbul (1993), Jerusalem (1994/1995, together with the ICTM-Study Group for Iconography), and Limassol, Cyprus (1996). These meetings resulted in comprehensive conference reports.

The [[International Study Group on Music Archaeology]] ([http://www.musicarchaeology.org/index.php ISGMA]) has been founded by Ellen Hickmann and Ricardo Eichmann in 1998. The Study Group emerged from the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology with the objective to obtain closer cooperation with archaeologists. Since then, the ISGMA has worked continuously with the German Archaeological Institute, Berlin (DAI, Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Berlin). A new series called "Studien zur Musikarchäologie" was created as a sub-series of "Orient-Archäologie" to present the conference reports of the ISGMA, and to integrate music-archaeological monographs independent of the Study Group's meetings; it is published by the Orient Department of the DAI through the Verlag Marie Leidorf. Between 1998 and 2004, conferences of ISGMA were held every two years at Michaelstein Monastery, Music Academy of Sachsen-Anhalt (Kloster Michaelstein, Landesmusikakademie Sachsen-Anhalt), sponsored by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).

In close cooperation with the Department for Ethnomusicology at the Ethnological Museum Berlin (Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, SMB SPK, Abteilung Musikethnologie, Medien-Technik und Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv), the 5th and 6th Symposium of the ISGMA were held in 2006 respectively in 2008 at the Ethnological Museum Berlin. In friendly cooperation with the Tianjin Conservatory of Music, the 7th Symposium of the ISGMA was held in Tianjin, China, in 2010. The 8th Symposium of the ISGMA (2012) was also held in China, in Suzhou and Beijing, and the 9th Symposium is being planned for September 2014, again held at the Ethnological Museum Berlin.

Meanwhile, the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology continued separately, and holds its own events, although a number of researchers are involved in both groups. After a couple of years of no activities, Julia L. J. Sanchez re-established the Study Group in 2003 on the initiative of Anthony Seeger, beginning with meetings in Los Angeles, California (2003), and Wilmington, North Carolina (2006). These were followed by a joint-conference in New York (2009), the 11th of the Study Group since its foundation in 1981 (also the 12th Conference of the Research Center for Music Iconography). The 12th conference was then held in Valladolid, Spain (2011), which was the largest meeting of the ICTM Study Group so far, followed by the 13th symposium of the Study Group held in Guatemala 2013. In 2015, the 14th symposium will be held in Poland. In 2013 it was decided to establish a new series, [http://www.ekho-verlag.com/category/series/publications-of-the-ictm-study-group-on-music-archaeology/ Publications of the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology], published through [https://www.facebook.com/ekhoverlag Ekho Verlag].

On 27 May 2011 a public concert under the banner of ''Palaeophonics'', funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) ''Beyond Text'' programme and the University of Edinburgh Campaign, took place at the George Square Theatre in Edinburgh. The event showcased the outcomes of collaborative research and creative practice by archaeologists, composers, filmmakers and performers from across Europe and the Americas. Whilst inspired and driven by research in music archaeology, ''Palaeophonics'' represents the emergence of a new, possibly significant, development within the field and within musicology which approaches the subject through the production and performance of new sound and music based multi-media creative works instead of through direct representation and reproduction. Said by some observers as 'experimental' and 'avant-garde', the event provoked mixed feedback from a wide public audience of around 250 people. A related publication is planned and further ''Palaeophonics'' events are thought to be taking place in the future, although none are currently programmed, whilst funding for developing the project is sourced.

In 2013, the [http://www.emaproject.eu European Music Archaeology Project] (EMAP) has been funded by the EU funding programme [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index_en.php EACEA], for the period of 5 years. The project will develop a touring exhibition on ancient music in Europe and an elaborate concert and event program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/musik-in-der-steinzeit-eu-projekt-zum-sound-der-vergangenheit-a-937534.html|title=Musik früherer Jahrhunderte: Von wegen alte Leier|first=Angelika|last=Franz|date=28 December 2013|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428122446/http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/musik-in-der-steinzeit-eu-projekt-zum-sound-der-vergangenheit-a-937534.html|archivedate=28 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaiologia.gr/en/blog/2013/06/13/listening-to-the-past/&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2002, [[John Negroponte]], the [[United States]] [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], stated (during a closed meeting of the [[UN Security Council]]) that the United States will oppose Security Council resolutions concerning the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] that condemn [[Israel]] without also condemning [[Terrorism|terrorist groups]]. This became known as the '''Negroponte Doctrine''', and has been viewed by officials in the United States as a counterweight to the [[List of the UN resolutions concerning Israel|frequent resolutions denouncing Israel]] that are passed by the [[UN General Assembly]].

Widely reported summaries of Negroponte's statement (an official transcript of these closed-session remarks does not appear to have been released) have stated that for any resolution to go forward, the United States, which has a [[UN Security Council Veto Power|veto]] in the 15-nation council, would expect it to have the following four elements:
:*A strong and explicit condemnation of all terrorism and incitement to terrorism;
:*A condemnation by name of the [[al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade|al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade]], [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] and [[Hamas]], groups that have claimed responsibility for suicide attacks on Israel;
:*An appeal to all parties for a political settlement of the crisis;
:*A demand for improvement of the security situation as a condition for any call for a withdrawal of Israeli armed forces to positions they held before the September 2000 start of the [[Second intifada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/u-s-un-resolutions-must-condemn-palestinian-terror-1.38559 |title=U.S.: UN Resolutions Must Condemn Palestinian Terror |access-date=January 23, 2017 |last= |first= |date=July 27, 2002 |format= |work=Haaretz |publisher= |location= |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Head Start''' was an experimental program by the [[United States Air Force]] during the [[Cold War]] where [[Strategic Air Command]] bombers were launched from [[Loring Air Force Base]] and loitered off of the coast of western [[Greenland]] and eastern [[Canada]]. It was operational from mid-September to mid-December 1958. It would eventually lead to [[Operation Chrome Dome]], as it was part of a series of programs which showed that a continuous airborne alert could be achieved.&lt;ref name=SAC&gt;{{cite book|title=The SAC Alert Program 1956-1959 (Historical Study No. 79)|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|location=[[Offutt Air Force Base]], [[Nebraska]]|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb304/sac_alert_program_ch3.pdf|author=[[Strategic Air Command]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GeorgeWashington&gt;{{cite web|title=The Air Force versus Hollywood|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb304/index.htm|publisher=[[George Washington University]]|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Operation Head Start was experimented at [[Loring Air Force Base]], from September to December, 1958. Through the actions of the crewmembers, it helped to demonstrate that a continuous airborne alert could be maintained successfully.&lt;ref name=Headstart&gt;{{cite video|people=[[42d Bombardment Wing]]|title=Operation Headstart|medium=Film reel|publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|location=[[Loring Air Force Base]], [[Maine]]|date=1959|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDWS_9uS9IM}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Before each flight, a briefing would be held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events as well as safety criteria. At least fifteen hours before takeoff, the crew would thoroughly pre-flight their aircraft. Inadvertently, this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other pre-flight routines. For the next twelve hours, crewmembers would enter a period of uninterrupted rest, and use the next three hours to prepare for takeoff. During this final preparation, they would first be taken to the cafeteria, where they would be fed a meal high in protein. After their final briefing, two crewmembers would be sent to pick up specialized meals for their long flight (the meals would later be prepared in an oven during flight).&lt;ref name=Headstart /&gt;

Every six hours, a bomber would then take off with live warheads and continue on a pre-determined path over [[Greenland]] and eastern [[Canada]], a trip that would end twenty hours later. Frequently, "Foxtrot: No message required," messages would be sent to the bomber from [[Strategic Air Command]] headquarters at [[Offutt Air Force Base]], with the idea that one of them could tell them to go to war, helping keep the crews on their feet. During their flight, many of the boom operators would enter admission into the ''Million Pound Club'', which meant that they had transferred a million or more pounds of fuel on ten sorties or less. The added benefit of the training runs, is that it made refuelling more routine. The corresponding group for the bomber crews would be the ''One Gulp Club'', for those who had taken on a hundred thousand pounds of fuel without a disconnect.&lt;ref name=Headstart /&gt;

While entering the landing pattern, the tower would alert the crash trucks to travel to the runway and await landing. This was a standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew would be interrogated prior to being let go, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted to the performance of the plane and other things that the crew might have noticed during their long flight. After being let go, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rub down.&lt;ref name=Headstart /&gt;

After six sorties, each bomber would receive a major individual inspection, allowing for it to be rotated out of the cycle.&lt;ref name=Headstart /&gt;

==Phases==
Head Start was directed to occur in three phases. Phase I would be a practising of the above procedures. Phase II would be a standing down of the wing, with one squadron being dispersed to [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]]. Phase III would include operating the above procedures, but using Bergstrom as a base of operations as well.&lt;ref name=SAC /&gt;

Plant macro[[fossil]]s are preserved through four main modes of preservation at archaeological sites. First, plant remains, usually [[cereal]] grains, chaff, seeds and charcoal are largely reduced to elemental carbon (charred) when they are heated in a reducing atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Märkle |first1=T|last2=Rösch|first2=M |title=Experiments on the effects of carbonization on some cultivated plant seeds |journal=Vegetation History and Archaeobotany |volume=17|pages=257–263 |doi=10.1007/s00334-008-0165-7|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00334-008-0165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are referred to as 'charred' or 'carbonised' plant remains. This mode of preservation is biased towards plant remains that come into contact with fire, through cooking or fuel use, and those that are less fragile, such as cereal grains and nutshell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hillman, G |title=Reconstructing crop husbandry practices from charred remains of crops|editor1-last=Mercer|editor1-first=R |work=Farming Practice in British Prehistory |date=1981|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|pages=123–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, plant remains deposited in permanently waterlogged anoxic conditions are preserved as the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenward |first1=H|last2=Hall |first2=A |title=Urban organic archaeology: an irreplacable palaeoecological archive at risk|journal=World Archaeology|date=2014 |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=584–596 |doi=10.1080/00438240802453286|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438240802453286#.VET0DIvF9ps}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode of preservation occurs in deep archaeological features such as wells, in urban settlements where organic refuse is rapidly deposited, and at settlements adjacent to lakes or rivers. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved, including seeds, fruit stones, nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jacomet, S |title=Archaeobotany: analyses of plant remains from waterlogged archaeological sites|editor1-last=Menotti|editor1-first=F|editor2-last=O'Sullivan |editor2-first=A |work=The Oxford Handbook of Wetland Archaeology|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=497–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third, calcium-phosphate mineralisation of plant remains occurs usually in latrine pits and in middens, as plant remains are completely replaced by calcium-phosphate. In latrine pits, plant remains consumed by humans are the most common items, such as seeds of flavourings, fruit pips and fruit stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=D |title=Defining an ‘indicator package’ to allow identification of ‘cess pits’ in the archaeological record|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=40|pages=526–543 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.06.014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440312002531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, plant remains are preserved by desiccation in arid environments, where the absence of water limits decomposition. Delicate vegetative plant remains are preserved, such as onion skin and artichoke bracts, alongside fruit stones, cereal chaff and seeds of wild plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Veen|first1=M|title=Formation processes of desiccated and carbonized plant remains e the identification of routine practice |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |date=2007 |volume=34 |issue=6|pages=968–990 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2006.09.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440306001865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recovery methods ==
Paleoethnobotanists use a variety of methods to recover and identify plant remains. Charred plant remains are usually recovered by flotation. The matrix (the soil from a suspected [[feature (archaeology)|archaeological feature]]) is slowly added to agitated water.  The soil, sand, and other heavy material, known as ''heavy fraction'', sink to the bottom. Less dense organic material, such as charred seeds, grains and charcoal tend to float to the surface. The material that floats to the top, called ''light fraction'', is poured into a sieve (usually 250-500&amp;nbsp;µm). The light fraction is then dried and later examined under a low power microscope.  Samples of the heavy fraction are also gathered for later analysis. Flotation can be undertaken manually with buckets, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/archaeobotany/buckets|title=buckets - archaeobotany|author=|date=|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by machine-assisted flotation where water is circulated through a series of tanks by a pump. Waterlogged plant remains are separated from the matrix by a combination of wet-sieving and/or small-scale flotation in a laboratory. &lt;ref&gt;Tolar et al. 2010. Recovery techniques for waterlogged archaeological sediments: a comparison of different treatment methods for samples from Neolithic lake shore settlements. Vegetation History and Archaeobotany 19: 53-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Desiccated plant remains are usually recovered by dry-sieving, using a stack of different sieves to separate larger items such as cereal straw and fruit stones from smaller items such as weed seeds. &lt;ref&gt;Cappers, R. T. J. and Neef, R. 2012. Handbook of Plant Palaeoecology. Groningen: Barkhuis.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification and Quantification ==
Identification of macroremains is then usually carried out under a stereomicroscope, using [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] features such as shape and surface features in the case of seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Method and Theory in Paleoethnobotany|last=Fritz|first=G|last2=Nesbitt|first2=M|publisher=University of Colorado|year=2014|isbn=|location=Boulder|pages=115–145|chapter=Laboratory analysis and identification of plant macroremains}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[histology|microanatomy]] in the case of wood or charcoal. Identification literature as well as a comparative collection of modern plant materials are crucial for reliable results. Depending on the type of material, and its condition, also other methods such as [[thin section]]s or [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] are applied. Plant macroremains are quantified on the basis of a sample, using either quantitative, semi-quantitive, or presence/absence scores.

Paleoethnobotanists also recover and analyze microremains (such as [[phytoliths]] and [[palynology|pollen]]), human and animal excrements ([[paleofeces]], sometimes called [[coprolite]]s), or plant impressions in ceramic sherds and clay (such as in daub).

[[Palynology]] is a mature and distinct scientific discipline that studies [[pollen]], typically in the context of reconstructing past environments.

[[Dendrochronology]], the study of growth rings on trees relating to study of past environments, is another scientific discipline useful to paleoethnobotanical study.

==Research==
The work done in paleoethnobotany can be divided into [[field work]], collections management, systematic description of species, and theories into the origins of human and plant interaction. Some examples of this analysis:

A paleoethnobotanist may find discrete concentrations of burned or dried remnants of seeds in an area of discolored soil (a possible [[hearth]] feature).  If later analyses indicates that the remnants were of only mature wild seeds of a type of plant that grows locally, it could be inferred that the site was only visited seasonally.  Such an inference could be supported by a lack of other features that would suggest that no permanent shelters were built at the site.

Alternatively, a paleoethnobotanist may find that a fire pit
feature contains concentrated remnants of a wide variety of edible
wild plants that mature throughout the year.  An archaeologist may find
features at the site that indicate some sort of semi-permanent
dwellings (such as post holes and [[middens]]).  The middens may have
concentrations of animal remains, identified by a [[zooarchaeology|zooarchaeologist]] as those of wild game, with a variety of species-specific maturity levels.  In that case, a more permanent settlement may be inferred, perhaps to the level of a village.  Such an analysis of the archaeological features could suggest a society of [[hunter-gatherer]]s who inhabited the site on a
more-or-less year-round basis.

A paleoethnobotanist may also find concentrated remains of plants
that typically are only grown through active [[tillage|cultivation]] (such as [[cereals]], [[legumes]], and [[oilseeds]]).  At the same site, an archaeologist might identify features such as stone walls surrounding enclosures arrayed in a pattern, and deep, layered middens with concentrations of domesticated animal remains such as goats or pigs.  An analysis of the site, set within the context of the archaeological features and animal and plant remains, would suggest a settled [[agriculture|agrarian]] community.

{{Redirect|Preemptive strike||Preemptive strike (disambiguation)}}
{{War}}
A '''preemptive war''' is a [[war]] that is commenced in an attempt to repel or defeat a perceived imminent offensive or [[invasion]], or to gain a strategic advantage in an impending (allegedly unavoidable) war ''shortly before'' that attack materializes. It is a war that preemptively 'breaks the peace'.

The term 'preemptive war' is sometimes confused with the term '[[preventive war]]'. The difference is that a preventive war is launched to destroy the potential threat of the targeted party, when an attack by that party is not [[Imminent threat|imminent]] or known to be planned. A preemptive war is launched in anticipation of immediate aggression by another party.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=20|publisher=Hofstra L. Rev.|pages=321|date=1991–1992|title=On Assassination as Anticipatory Self-Defense: The Case of Israel|author=Beres, Louis Rene|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/hoflr20&amp;section=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most contemporary scholarship equates preventive war with aggression, and therefore argues that it is illegitimate.&lt;ref name=shue&gt;Shue, Henry and Rhodin, David (2007). ''Preemption: Military Action and Moral Justification''. Oxford University Press. p. 116. {{ISBN|978-0-19-923313-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waging of a preemptive war has less stigma attached than does the waging of a preventive war.&lt;ref&gt;Shue and Rodin 2007, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiation of armed conflict: that is being the first to 'break the peace' when no 'armed attack' has yet occurred, is not permitted by the [[UN Charter]], unless authorized by the UN Security Council as an enforcement action. Some authors have claimed that when a presumed adversary first appears to be beginning confirmable preparations for a possible future attack, but has not yet actually attacked, that the attack has in fact 'already begun', however this opinion has not been upheld by the UN.&lt;ref name = "colin gray"&gt;{{cite web

==Theory and practice of preemptive war==

===Prior to World War I===
As early as 1625, [[Hugo Grotius]] characterized a state's right of self-defense to include the right to forestall an attack forcibly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=5|publisher=Temp. Int'l &amp; Comp. L.J.|pages=231|year=1991|title=Permissibility of State-Sponsored Assassination during Peace and War, The|author=Beres, Louis R.|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/tclj5&amp;section=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1685, the Scottish government conducted a preemptive strike against the [[Clan Campbell]], called the Argyll Whigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Heyck|title=A History of the Peoples of the British Isles: From 1688 to 1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=beQDAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29|date=27 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-41521-2|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, a certain legal precedent regarding preemptive wars was established in the ''[[Caroline affair]]'' when [[British Army|British forces]] in [[Canada]] crossed the [[United States]] border and killed several Canadian rebels and one American citizen who were preparing an offensive against the British in Canada. The [[United States]] rejected the legal ground of the Caroline case. In 1842, [[US Secretary of State]] [[Daniel Webster]] said that the necessity for forcible reaction must be "instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation." That formulation is part of the [[Caroline test]], which "is broadly cited as enshrining the appropriate [[international customary law|customary law]] standard."&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Helen (2005). ''The 'War on Terror' and the Framework of International Law''. Cambridge University Press. p. 157.{{ISBN|978-0521547352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I (1914–1918)===
Austro-Hungarian Chief of the General Staff [[Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]] argued for a preemptive war against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] in 1913.&lt;ref name="DiNardo2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard L. DiNardo|title=Invasion: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915: The Conquest of Serbia, 1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZeIBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13|date=14 April 2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-4408-0093-1|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia had the image of an aggressive and expansionist power and was seen as a threat to Austria-Hungary in [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref name="DiNardo2015"/&gt; The assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] (June 1914) was used as an excuse for Austria-Hungary [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|to attack]] Serbia, leading to World War I.&lt;ref name="Neiberg2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael S.

During the course of the destructive and costly [[World War I]], for the first time in history, the concept of "[[the war to end war]]" began to be seriously considered.&lt;ref name="woodrow wilson's idea"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1108.html|title=United States History: Woodrow Wilson|accessdate=1010-11-30}} Discussion of Woodrow Wilson's desire to make World War I the War to End All Wars.&lt;/ref&gt; As a further expression of that hope, upon the conclusion of the war, the [[League of Nations]] was formed. Its primary aim was to prevent war, as all signatories were required to agree to desist from the initiation of all wars, preemptive or otherwise. All of the victorious nations emerging out of World War I eventually signed the agreement, with the notable exception of the United States.&lt;ref name="league of nations summary"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/elro/glossary/league-of-nations.htm|title=Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic Site: League of Nations article|accessdate=2010-11-30}} Article summarizing the primary objective of the League of Nations.&lt;/ref&gt;

===League of Nations period (1919–1939)===
[[File:193109 mukden incident railway sabotage.jpg|thumb|Japanese experts inspect the scene of the 'railway sabotage' at [[Mukden]] on South Manchurian Railway]]
During the 1920s, the League peaceably settled numerous international disputes, and was generally perceived as succeeding in its primary purpose. It was only in the 1930s that its effectiveness in preventing wars began to come into question. Such questions began to arise when it first became apparent in 1931 that it was incapable of halting aggression by Japan in Manchuria. In the [[Mukden Incident]], Japan claimed to be fighting a 'defensive war' in [[Manchuria]], attempting to 'preempt' supposedly aggressive Chinese intentions towards the Japanese. According to the Japanese, the Chinese had started the war by blowing up a railway line near Mukden, China. Therefore, the Chinese were the aggressors, and the Japanese were merely 'defending themselves'. A predominance of evidence has since indicated that the railway had in fact been blown up by Japanese operatives.&lt;ref name="mukden incident"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=18|title=Mukden Incident and Manchukuo: C.

[[File:Glivice radio tower.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Gliwice Radio Tower]] today. It was the scene of the [[Gleiwitz incident]] in September 1939]]
In 1933, the impotency of the League became more pronounced when notices were provided by Japan and Germany that they would be terminating their memberships in the League. Italy shortly followed suit and exited the League in 1937.&lt;ref name="lon timeline"&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/timeline.htm|title=League of Nations Timeline|accessdate=2010-11-30}} A timeline of all major League events.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, Italy and Germany also began engaging in militaristic campaigns designed to either enlarge their borders or to expand their sphere of military control, and the League was shown to be powerless to stop them.&lt;ref name="lon timeline"/&gt; The perceived impotency of the League was a contributing factor which eventually led to the full outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="lon impotence precipitates wwii"&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://www.factmonster.com/ce6/history/A0859217.html|title=Factmonster Encyclopedia— League of Nations: Successes and Failures|accessdate=2010-11-30}} Description of the demise of the League of Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; The start of World War II is generally dated from the event of Germany's invasion of Poland. It is noteworthy that Germany claimed at the time that its invasion of Poland was in fact a 'defensive war,' as it had allegedly been invaded by a group of Polish saboteurs, signaling a potentially larger invasion of Germany by Poland that was soon to be under way. Thus, Germany was left with no option but to preemptively invade Poland, thereby halting the alleged Polish plans to invade Germany. It was later discovered that Germany had fabricated the evidence for the alleged Polish saboteurs as a part of the [[Gleiwitz incident]].

===World War II period (1939–1945)===
Once again, during the course of the even more widespread and lethal World War II, the hope of somehow definitively ending all war (including preemptive war) was seriously discussed. That dialogue ultimately resulted in the re-establishment of the successor organization to the old League, namely the [[United Nations]] (UN). As with the League, the primary aim and hope of the new UN was the prevention of all wars (including preemptive wars). Unlike the previous League, the organization had the support of the [[United States]].

In analyzing the many components of World War II, if one might consider as separate individual wars, the various attacks on previously neutral countries, one might consider the attacks against Iran and Norway to have been preemptive wars.

In the case of [[Norway]], the 1940 [[German invasion of Norway]] in the 1946 [[Nuremberg trials]] the German defense argued that Germany was "compelled to attack Norway by the need to forestall an Allied invasion and that her action was therefore preemptive."&lt;ref&gt;Myres Smith McDougal, Florentino P. Feliciano, ''The International Law of War: Transnational Coercion and World Public Order" pp. 211, 212&lt;/ref&gt; The German defence was referring to [[Plan R 4]] and its predecessors. Norway was vital to Germany as a transport route for iron ore from [[Sweden]], a supply that Britain was determined to stop. One adopted British plan was to go through Norway and occupy cities in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;"COMMAND DECISIONS", CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY WASHINGTON, D.C., 2000. [http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_0.htm URL] p. 59 "The British plan which was adopted was more modest. While ostensibly intended to bring Allied troops to the Finnish front, it laid its main emphasis on operations in northern Norway and Sweden. The main striking force was to land at Narvik and advance along the railroad to its eastern terminus at Lulea, occupying Kiruna and Gallivare along the way. By late April two Allied brigades were to be established along that line."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"COMMAND DECISIONS", CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY WASHINGTON, D.C., 2000. [http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_0.htm URL] p. 66, 67 "The British held back two divisions from France, intending to put them into the field in Norway, and planned to expand their force eventually to 100,000 men. The French intended to commit about 50,000. The British and French staffs agreed that the latter half of March would be the best time for going into Norway;"&lt;/ref&gt; An Allied invasion was ordered on March 12, and the Germans intercepted radio traffic setting March 14 as deadline for the preparation.&lt;ref&gt;"COMMAND DECISIONS", CENTER OF MILITARY HISTORY DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY WASHINGTON, D.C., 2000. [http://www.history.army.mil/books/70-7_0.htm URL] p.67,68 "The objectives were to take Narvik, the railroad, and the Swedish ore fields;" "an intercepted radio message setting 14 March as the deadline for preparation of transport groups indicated that the Allied operation was getting under way. But another message, intercepted on the 15th, ordering the submarines to disperse revealed that the peace [in Finland] had disrupted the Allied plan."&lt;/ref&gt; Peace in Finland interrupted the Allied plans, but Hitler became, rightly, convinced that the Allies would try again, and ordered operation [[Weseruebung]].

The new Allied plans were [[Operation Wilfred|Wilfred]] and [[Plan R 4]].

===Post September 11, 2001 Bush administration period (2002–2008)===

The doctrine of preemption gained renewed reputation following the [[U.S. invasion of Iraq]]. Bush administration mainly claimed for the necessity to intervene to prevent [[Saddam Hussein]] from deploying [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) prior to launching an armed attack. At that time, U.S. decision-makers claimed Saddam's [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] might be given to terrorists groups and claimed that security of the nation was at a great risk. Soon the Congress passed its joint resolution in October 2002 authorizing the president to use military force against Saddam Hussein's regime.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George, and Jens Ohlin. ''Defending Humanity''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was later confirmed that no [[nuclear weapon]]s or [[biological weapon]]s capability existed and that [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s suspicion was mistaken. Some questioned the true intention of Bush administration for invading Iraq, based on possibility of [[retaliation]] on the terrorist attacks which occurred on [[September 11, 2001]]. It is still unclear whether the U.S. invasion of Iraq is legally justifiable and, at the same time, whether Iraq’s resistance to the attack is justifiable.

====Arguments for preemptive war made during the Bush administration====

=====Sofaer's four elements=====
The scholar [[Abraham David Sofaer|Abraham D. Sofaer]] identified four key elements for justification of preemption:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sofaer Abraham D | year = 2003 | title = On the Necessity of Pre-emption | url = http://ejil.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/14/2/209 | journal = European Journal of International Law | volume = 14 | issue = 2| page = 220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The nature and magnitude of the threat involved;
# The likelihood that the threat will be realized unless preemptive action is taken;
# The availability and exhaustion of alternatives to using force; and
# Whether using preemptive force is consistent with the terms and purposes of the [[United Nations Charter|U.N. Charter]] and other applicable international agreements.

=====Walzer's three elements=====
Professor Mark R. Amstutz (citing [[Michael Walzer]]) adopted a similar but slightly varied set of criteria and noted three factors when evaluating the justification of a preemptive strike.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Amstutz, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_V6f8j9pgDoC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=preemptive+%22six+day+war%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5isiTKaCHsKUnQeSifnADw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6wEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=preemptive%20%22six%20day%20war%22&amp;f=false International Ethics: Concepts, Theories, and Cases in Global Politics]''&lt;/ref&gt;
# The existence of an intention to injure;
# The undertaking of military preparations that increase the level of danger; and
# The need to act immediately because of a higher degree of risk.

=====The counter proliferation self-help paradigm=====
[[File:F-16netz002.jpg|thumb|right|Israeli Air Force F-16A ''[[Netz 107]]'' with 6.5 aerial victory marks and [[Operation Opera|Osirak]] bombing mark]]
The proliferation of [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMDs]] by rogue nations gave rise to a certain argument by scholars concerning preemption.&lt;ref&gt;Col Guy Roberts, USMC (Ret) 27 ''Denver Journal of International Law &amp; Policyy'' 483&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven C. Welsh, [http://www.cdi.org/news/law/preemptive-war.cfm Preemptive War and International Law] Center for Defense Information, 5 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kacerauskis pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the threat need not be "imminent" in the classic sense and that the illicit acquisition of these weapons, with their capacity to unleash massive destruction, by [[rogue state]]s, created the requisite threat to peace and stability as to have justified the use of preemptive force. [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO's]] Deputy Assistant Secretary General for WMD, Guy Roberts cited the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the 1998 US [[Operation Infinite Reach|attack]] on a [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory|Sudanese pharmaceutical plant]], (identified by US intelligence to have been a chemical weapons facility) and the 1981 Israeli attack on Iraq's nuclear facility at [[Operation Opera|Osirak]] as examples of the counter-proliferation self-help paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, n. 528–536&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Osirak attack, Roberts noted that at the time, few legal scholars argued in support of the Israeli attack but notes further that, "subsequent events demonstrated the perspicacity of the Israelis, and some scholars have re-visited that attack arguing that it was justified under anticipatory self-defense."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts n. 530–532&lt;/ref&gt; Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, American forces captured a number of documents detailing conversations that Sadaam Hussein had with his inner sanctum.&lt;ref name="hussein"&gt;{{cite news|title=Papers From Iraqi Archive Reveal Conspiratorial Mind-Set of Hussein|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/world/middleeast/archive-offers-rare-glimpse-inside-mind-of-saddam-hussein.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Saadam%20Hussein&amp;st=cse|author=Gordon, Michael, R.|date=25 October 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive of documents and recorded meetings confirm that Hussein was indeed aiming to strike at Israel.&lt;ref name=hussein/&gt; In a 1982 conversation Hussein stated that, "Once Iraq walks out victorious, there will not be any Israel." Of Israel's anti-Iraqi endeavors he noted, "Technically, they [the Israelis] are right in all of their attempts to harm Iraq."&lt;ref name=hussein/&gt;

===Post–Bush administration period (2009–present)===
Since the departure of the Bush administration, the Obama administration has made no such claims to retain the right to declare a preemptive war, but has adopted and continued many policies of the Bush Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-05-23/news/krauthammer-column-advimmediate-20110523-14_1_obama-administration-bush-doctrine-jewish-state|work=Chicago Tribune|first=Charles|last=Krauthammer|title=Obama adopts the Bush Doctrine|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intention==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}

The intention with a preemptive strike is to gain the advantage of ''initiative'' and to harm the enemy at a moment of minimal protection, for instance, while vulnerable during transport or [[mobilization]]; however the concept of preemptive war can be used to start a war by claiming that the nation would soon be under attack and therefore had to defend itself. The concept is controversial because it can be used as a justification to start a war on questionable grounds.

While the labeling of an attack (on [[Military strategy|strategic]] and [[Military tactics|tactical]] levels) seldom is controversial, it is much more so in regard to the initiation of a war.

In his work titled "Rationalist Explanations for War", James Fearon attributes the use of preemptive strikes by rational states to both offensive advantages and commitment problems between states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James|date=1995|title=Rationalist Explanations for War|url=|journal=International Organization|volume=49|pages=379–414|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033324}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a nation possesses a first strike advantage and believes itself to have a high probability of winning a war, then there is a narrower de facto bargaining range between them and an opposing country for peaceful settlements. In extreme cases, if the probability of winning minus the probable costs of war is high enough, then no self-enforcing peaceful outcome exists. In his discussion of preventative war arising from a commitment problem, Fearon builds an infinite-horizon model expected payoffs from period t on are (pt/(l - δ)) - Ca for state A and ((1 -pt)/(l - δ)) - Cb for
state B, where Ca and Cb are costs incurred the respective states and δ is the state discount of the future period payoffs. This model shows that a peaceful settlement can be reached at any period that both states prefer, but strategic issues arise when there is no credible third-party guaranteer of the both states committing to a peaceful foreign policy. If there is going to be a shift in the military power between states in the future and no credible restraint is placed on the rising military power not to exploit its future advantage, then it is rational for the state with declining military power to use a preventative attack while it has a higher chance of winning the war. Fearon points out that the declining state attacks not due to fear of a future attack, but because the peace settlement in the future would be worse for it than in the current period. The lack of trust that leads to a declining power's preemptive strike does not stem from uncertainty about intentions of different nations, but rather "the situation, the structure of preferences and opportunities, that gives one party incentive to renege" on its peaceful cooperation and exploit its increased military potential in the future to win a more profitable peace settlement for itself. Thus, Fearon shows that preemptive military action is taken by nations when there is an unfavorable shift in military potential in the future which leads to a shrinking bargain range for a peaceful settlement in the current period, but with no credible commitment by the other party to not exploit their improved military potential in the future.

==Legality==
{{Further|War of aggression|Jus ad bellum|UN Charter}}
[[UN Charter#Article 2|Article 2, Section 4]] of the [[United Nations Charter|U.N. Charter]] is generally considered to be ''jus cogens'' (literally: "compelling law", in practice: "higher international law"), and prohibits all UN members from exercising "the ''threat'' or ''use'' of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state". But in the modern framework of the UN Charter, it is the phrase "armed attack occurs" in Article 51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml/|title=https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter7.shtml/|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that draws the line between legitimate and illegitimate military force.&lt;ref name="George"/&gt; Some scholars believe it is reasonable to assume that if no armed attack has yet occurred that no automatic justification for preemptive 'self-defense' has yet been made 'legal' under the UN Charter. In order to be justified as an act of self-defense, two conditions must be fulfilled which are widely regarded as necessary for its justification. The first of these is that actor must have believed that the threat is real, as opposed to (merely) perceived. The second condition is that the force used in self-defense must be proportional to the harm which the actor is threatened. When it comes to a situation where an armed attack is considered as a self-defense, it usually narrows realistic options for avoidance by nonviolent means such as negotiation, retreat, or calling upon higher authorities (such as the police or the UN).&lt;ref&gt;David, and Henry Shue.

'''Prečani''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Пречани}}){{Cref2|a}} was a Serbian [[blanket term]] used at the end of the 19th- and early 20th century for [[Serbs|ethnic Serb communities]] located ''{{lang|sr|preko}}'' ("across") the [[Danube]], [[Sava]] and [[Drina]] rivers, beyond the northern and western borders of [[History of modern Serbia|19th-century Serbia]], that is, in [[Austria-Hungary]]-held [[Vojvodina]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]. It was thus used to distinguish Serbs of Serbia ("[[Serbians]]") from those in the historical [[Habsburg Monarchy]]; it was not applied to the [[Serbs of Montenegro]] or those in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and elsewhere in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In the Habsburg lands – in [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the Serbs established the [[Serb People's Party (Dalmatia)|Serb People's Party]], while in the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] they established the [[Serb Independent Party]]. In 1918 the Prečani Serbs formed a notable political constituency that participated in the founding of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] as well as the joining of [[Banat, Bačka and Baranja]] with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. In the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|first Yugoslavia]], their political party, the [[Independent Democratic Party (Yugoslavia)|Independent Democratic Party]] was important in national politics. After the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]], they were the main target of the [[World War II persecution of Serbs]].

The term was primarily used in the Kingdom of Serbia and was not used by the Austro-Hungarian Serbs themselves. Today, the Prečani constitute the '''[[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]''', '''[[Serbs of Croatia]]''' and '''[[Serbs in Vojvodina]]'''.

[[File:Shoh Boval Belintash 2014.jpg|thumb|Robert Bauval (right) and [[Robert Schoch]] at the prehistoric cult centre of [[Belintash]] ([[Bulgaria]]) in 2014.]]

'''Robert Bauval''' (born {{birth date and age|1948|3|5|df=y}} in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]) is a Belgian author, lecturer, and [[pseudoscience]] popularizer, perhaps best known for his fringe [[Orion Correlation Theory]] regarding the [[Giza pyramid complex]].

==Early life==
Bauval was born in Alexandria, Egypt, to parents of [[Belgium|Belgian]] and [[Malta|Maltese]] origins. He attended the British Boys' School in Alexandria (now [[El Nasr Boys' School]]) and the [[Franciscan]] College in [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]]. He left Egypt in 1967 just before the [[Six-Day War]], during the presidency of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. He has spent most of his engineering career living and working in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]] as a [[construction engineer]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Writing career==
In late 1992, Bauval had been trying to obtain a translation of ''[[Hermetica]]'' by [[Walter Scott (scholar)|Walter Scott]]. He then came across a new edition printed by Solo Press with a foreword by Adrian Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Scott, ''Hermetica: The Ancient Greek and Latin Writings which contain Religious or Philosophic Teachings ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus'' (Solo Press, 1992). {{ISBN|1-873616-02-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauval contacted Gilbert after being interested in his foreword concerning a link between an Alexandrine school of [[Hermes Trismegistus]] and the pyramid builders of the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt]]. They went on to write ''The Orion Mystery'' together, which became an international bestseller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/horizon-censured-for-unfair-treatment-622719.html|title='Horizon' censured for unfair treatment|author=Jane Robins, Media Correspondent|date=22 September 2011|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[BBC Two]] broadcast a documentary on Bauval's ideas around the time of the book's publication.&lt;ref name="egyptology"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/egyptology--trying-to-build-heaven-on-earth-controversial-new-research-suggests-that-the-pyramids-were-a-map-of-the-stars-reports-david-keys-1391311.html|title=EGYPTOLOGY / Trying to build heaven on earth: Controversial new|author=David Keys|date=21 September 2015|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has co-authored three books with [[Graham Hancock]],including 2004's ''Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith''  in which the two put forward what sociologist of religion [[David V. Barrett]]in a review in ''The Independent'' described ''Talisman'' as a factually incorrect and unconvincing "mess of a book" based upon indiscriminate use of source material culminating by "promulgating a version of the old Jewish-Masonic plot so beloved by ultra-right-wing conspiracy theorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David V. |last=Barrett|publisher= ''[[The Independent]]''|date= 18 August 2004 |title=Talisman: Sacred Cities, Secret Faith, by Graham Hancock &amp; Robert Bauval|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/talisman-sacred-cities-secret-faith-by-graham-hancock-robert-bauval-557110.html |accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orion Correlation Theory==
Bauval is specifically known for the [[Orion Correlation Theory]] (OCT), which proposes a relationship between the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|fourth dynasty]] [[Egyptian pyramids]] of the [[Giza Plateau]] and the alignment of certain stars in the [[constellation]] of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]].&lt;ref name="Fagan2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fagan|first=Garrett G.|title=Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIYpx9mzd4gC&amp;pg=PA249|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-30592-1|pages=38–39, 249–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 20 years before Bauval's book ''The Orion Mystery'' suggested that the Giza Pyramids were aligned to Orion's belt, Dr. James J. Hurtak pointed out such a correlation in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Giza Death Star Deployed: The Physics and Engineering of the Great Pyramid|last=Farrell|first=Joseph|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|year=2003|isbn=1931882193|location=|pages=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One night in 1983, while working in [[Saudi Arabia]], he took his family and a friend's family up into the sand dunes of the [[Arabian desert]] for a camping expedition. His friend pointed out the constellation of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], and mentioned that [[Alnitak]], the most easterly of the stars making up Orion's belt, was offset slightly from the others. Bauval then made a connection between the layout of the three main stars in Orion's belt and the layout of the three main pyramids in the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza necropolis]].&lt;ref&gt;The theory, known as the Orion Correlation Theory or OCT, was first published in ''Discussions in Egyptology'' (DE, Volume 13, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orion Correlation Theory has been described as a form of [[pseudoscience]].{{cn|date=November 2018}} Among the idea's critics have been two astronomers: [[Ed Krupp]] of [[Griffith Observatory]] in Los Angeles, and [[Anthony Patrick Fairall|Anthony Fairall]], astronomy professor at the [[University of Cape Town]], South Africa. Krupp and Fairall independently investigated the angle between the alignment of Orion's Belt to North during the era cited by Bauval (which differs from the angle in the 3rd millennium BCE, because of the [[precession of the equinoxes]]), and found that the angle was somewhat different from the 'perfect match' claimed by Bauval and Hancock: 47 to 50 degrees, compared to the 38-degree angle formed by the pyramids.&lt;ref name="Fairall"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fairall, Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Patrick Fairall |date=June 1999 |title=Precession and the layout of the Ancient Egyptian pyramids |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |url=http://www.antiquityofman.com/Fairall_Orion_precession.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krupp also pointed out that the slightly-bent line formed by the three pyramids was deviated towards the North, whereas the slight "kink" in the line of Orion's Belt was deformed to the South, meaning that a direct correlation would require one or the other to be inverted.&lt;ref name="Krupp1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krupp, Ed |authorlink=Ed Krupp |title=Pyramid Marketing Schemes |journal=Sky and Telescope |date=February 1997 |url=http://www.antiquityofman.com/Krupp_pyramid_marketing_schemes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this is what was done in the original book by Bauval and Gilbert (''The Orion Mystery''), which compared images of the pyramids and Orion without revealing that the pyramids' map had been inverted.&lt;ref name="Krupp2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Krupp, Ed|title=Astronomical Integrity at Giza |year=2002 |url=http://www.antiquityofman.com/Krupp_refutes_Bauval_and_Roy.html |publisher=The Antiquity of Man |accessdate=2006-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krupp and Fairall find other problems with the claims, including the point that if the Sphinx is meant to represent the constellation of [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]], then it should be on the opposite side of the Nile (the 'Milky Way') from the pyramids ('Orion'),&lt;ref name="Fairall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Krupp1" /&gt; that the [[vernal equinox]] around 10,500 BCE was in [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]] and not Leo,&lt;ref name="Fairall" /&gt; and that the constellations of the [[Zodiac]] originate from Mesopotamia and were unknown in Egypt at the time.&lt;ref name="Krupp2" /&gt;

==''Atlantis Reborn'' documentary==
On 4 November 1999, the BBC broadcast a documentary entitled ''Atlantis Reborn'' which tested the ideas of Robert Bauval and his colleague, Graham Hancock.  Bauval and Hancock afterwards complained to the BSC (Broadcasting Standards Commission) that they had been treated unfairly.  A hearing followed and in November 2000 the BSC ruled in favour of the documentary makers on all but one of the ten principal complaints brought by Hancock and Bauval.

The BSC concluded that Hancock and Bauval had been treated unfairly in respect of an omission of their rebuttal of a specific argument against the Orion Correlation Theory.  In regard of the nine remaining principal complaints, the BSC ruled against Hancock and Bauval, concluding that they had not been treated unfairly in the criticism of their theories concerning carbon-dating, the Great Sphinx of Egypt, Cambodia's Angkor temples, Japan's [[Yonaguni Monument|Yonaguni formation]] and the mythical land of Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisreborn_bsc_synopsis.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Atlantis Reborn Again|first=British Broadcasting|last=Corporation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC offered to broadcast a revised version of the documentary, which was welcomed by Hancock and Bauval.  It was broadcast as ''Atlantis Reborn Again'' on 14 December 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Atlantis Reborn Again|first=British Broadcasting|last=Corporation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revised documentary continued to present serious doubts about Bauval and Hancock's ideas, as held by astronomer Anthony Fairall, Ed Krupp of the Griffith Observatory, Egyptologist Kate Spence of Cambridge University and Eleanor Mannikka of the University of Michigan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/atlantisrebornagain_transcript.shtml|title=BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon - Atlantis Reborn Again|last=Corporation|first=British Broadcasting|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2274">'''Robert of Auxerre''' (c. 1156-1212), [[France|French]] [[chronicler]], was an inmate of the monastery of St Marien at [[Auxerre]].

At the request of [[Milo de Trainel]] (1155–1202), abbot of this house, he wrote a ''Chronicon'', or [[universal history]], which covers the period between the creation of the world and 1211. For the years previous to 1181 this is merely a compilation from [[Prosper of Aquitaine]], [[Sigebert of Gembloux]] and others, but it is an original authority for the period from 1181 to 1211.

It is one of the most valuable sources for the [[history of France]] during the reign of [[Philip Augustus]], and it also contains information about other European countries, the [[Crusades]] and affairs in the East. [[Auguste Molinier]], in fact, describes the author as one of the best historians of the [[Middle Ages]]. Robert was evidently a man of great diligence and of sound judgment. Two continuators took the work down to 1228 and it was extensively used by later chroniclers. [[Vincent of Beauvais]] made extensive use of it in his ''Speculum Historiale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Neel, Carol|title=Man's Restoration: Robert of Auxerre and the Writing of History in the Early Thirteenth Century|year=1988|volume=44|pages=251–274|doi=10.1017/S0362152900007078}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original manuscript of the ''Chronicon'' is now at Auxerre.

The ''Chronicon'' was first published by [[Nicolas Camuzat]] (1575–1655) at [[Troyes]] in 1608; the best edition is in Band xxvi of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae historica]]'' ''Scriptores'', with introduction by [[Oswald Holder-Egger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul, Nicholas L.|title=To Follow in Their Footsteps: The Crusades and Family Memory in the High Middle Ages|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2012|page=314|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iFJIRZvB7nUC&amp;pg=PA316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert has been identified, but on very questionable grounds, with a certain Robert Abolant, an official of the monastery of St Marien, who died in 1214.

'''Santa María Atzompa''' is a town and [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] located in the Mexican state of [[Oaxaca]], about five km from the state capital of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]].
It is part of the [[Centro District, Oaxaca|Centro District]] in the [[Valles Centrales de Oaxaca|Valles Centrales region]].&lt;ref name="encmuc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20399a.htm |title=Santa María Atzompa |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico |publisher=INAFED |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718113901/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/oaxaca/municipios/20399a.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town was founded between the 7th and 9th centuries as a satellite of the ancient [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] city of [[Monte Albán]]. Since its founding, pottery making has been a major economic activity and the town is currently known for its green-glazed pottery. This pottery used to be shipped all over Mexico and exported to the United States but today most of this pottery is sold locally. Beginning in  2009, there has been excavation at the Atzompa archeological site, leading to the discovery of a 45-meter [[Mesoamerican ball court]], which has been determined to have been on the principal one for Monte Alban.&lt;ref name="pelota"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dti.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3014&amp;Itemid=329 |title=Hallan juego de pelota |date=March 24, 2009 |publisher=[[INAH]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Ball court found |accessdate=March 18, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the town is rustic with the smoke of wood-fired pottery kilns ever present. Poverty has been a concern for the town, but innovations such as the use of lead-free glazing and a communal crafts market have been implemented to improve the craft's prospects.&lt;ref name="colorverde"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4014-Arte-color-verde-%28Oaxaca%29 |title=Arte color verde (Oaxaca) |first=Fabiola |last=González Ramírez |date=February 1999 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art color green |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722014648/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/4014-Arte-color-verde-(Oaxaca) |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The town was founded between 650 and 850 C.E. as a satellite city to Monte Alban, along with other nearby communities such as Cerro del Gallo, El Plumaje, Monte Alban Chico and El Mogollito. These communities were created as a result of the expansion of the large Zapotec city, but were considered to be separate units, rather than neighborhoods of the city proper. The Atzompa community was established on a hill for strategic reasons, overlooking the fertile Valley of Etla below, partly as a bulwark against the neighboring [[Mixtec]]. There is also evidence that the town served as the last way station for quarried stone making its way to the construction of the last buildings in the city of Monte Alban. Objects found at the site include local [[barro negro pottery]] as well as obsidian and other objects showing trade connections with areas such as [[Teotihuacan]], Sierra de las Navajas in [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="pelota"/&gt;

Atzompa has been a major producer of pottery since the Monte Alban period. Most of it at that time was the gray pottery typical of the surrounding area although there is a greater diversity of shapes, including [[jaguar]] heads and eagle claws.&lt;ref name="pelota"/&gt;  After the Spanish conquest, Santa Maria was added to its native name of Atzompa ("high water mark" in Nahuatl),&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; and lead glazing techniques were introduced in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt;
In the mid 20th century, Atzompa was the main producer of ceramics for the region, and its products were shipped to all parts of Mexico and exported to the United States.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt; However, concerns about the lead content in the glaze pummeled the Mexican pottery market.&lt;ref name="jpreston"&gt;{{cite news |title= Santa Maria Atzompa Journal;Pots That Poison, and Potters Facing Broken Lives |first=Julia |last=Preston |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/world/santa-maria-atzompa-journal-pots-that-poison-and-potters-facing-broken-lives.html?pagewanted=1 |newspaper=New York Times |location= New York |date=June 14, 1996 |accessdate=March 18, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, most of the community's distinctive green-glazed pottery is sold in neighboring Oaxaca city, with most families here making a subsistence living through that and by growing corn.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt;

Recently, several innovations have been devised to try to help revive the pottery market. In the 1990s, the Mexican government developed lead-free glazes to be mass marketed.&lt;ref name="jpreston"/&gt; In the 2000s, a cooperative pottery market was created in the town,&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt; and the efforts of potter Dolores Porra, who created new designs and colors, has been recognized.&lt;ref name="extranjeros"&gt;{{cite news |title= Extranjeros homenajean a Dolores Porras, pionera de la cerámica de Atzompa |first= Georgina |last= Chávez |url= http://www.cronicaoaxaca.info/cultura/2103-extranjeros-homenajean-a-dolores-porras-pionera-de-la-ceramica-de-atzompa-.html  |newspaper= Crónica de Oaxaca |location=Oaxaca, Oaxaca |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Foreigners pay homage to Dolores Porras, pioneer of the ceramics of Atzompa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the 20th century, only men were permitted to be on the municipal council. The first women were elected to serve in 1999.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

==The town==
The center of the town of Santa Maria Atzompa has a rustic church with two towers, a main plaza with [[kiosk]], one school, and a half built municipal palace in this center. A new crafts market was built here to promote the town's wares. The humble houses are made of [[adobe]] and boards and the sidewalks are not paved.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt; All around town, one can see black smoke rising from the pottery kilns firing jars, pots, [[comal (cookware)|comal]]s, plates and other dishes. Most of these are sold in the markets of Oaxaca city, but it is also widely available in the streets of the town in makeshift stalls.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt; Foods that can be found in markets here include various [[mole (sauce)|moles]], [[barbacoa]], [[tamale]]s, [[nopal]] soup, with beef and chicken being the most common meats.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

Despite being close to the city of Oaxaca, Atzompa is a very poor community which subsists mostly on the production of its signature green pottery.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt; In very poor neighborhoods such as Colonia Forestal, schools are shacks made from cardboard, wood and boards with dirt floors. Sinks, windows and bathrooms are often missing. These buildings can be very hot or very cold depending on the year and often leak when it rains. In the Colonial Forestal kindergarten, 85 children receive their education in a construction of this type. It was founded in the 1990s, by the Instituto Estatal de Educacion Publica de Oaxaca. The land on which it sits is only loaned to the school.&lt;ref name="ascencio"&gt;{{cite news |title= En Santa María Atzompa, clases de miseria desde nivel prescolar |first= Octavio |last= Vélez Ascencio |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/10/07/index.php?section=estados&amp;article=034n1est |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=October 7, 2009 |page=34 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=In Santa Maria Atzompa, clases in misery from preschool }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town is attracting an increasing number of Mexican and international tourists because of its pottery, which is helping the town's economy. The new crafts market has done much to attract these tourists. The market is not only a central location for the sale of the pottery, it is also set up to allow communal selling of the products and allow the artisans to spend less time selling and more time making pottery. The pieces are labeled as to the artisan and the artisans rotate shifts at the market.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt;

It is a very traditional town which, Sundays are still a day of rest when no pottery is worked on.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt; There are also a large number of celebrations here, the roots of which go back centuries. Weddings are celebrated in the houses of both the bride and the groom, generally taking place on Sunday. On Sunday morning, the groom's parents, accompanied by family, arrive early in the morning to the bride's house with a musical band, flowers and an incense burner. They will accompany the bride to the church. The bride's dress is usually paid for by the groom's family, but if not, the groom's family will sponsor the lunch. The wedding proper takes place after this lunch. After the wedding ceremony, the bride returns home to receive the blessing of her parents, which is celebrated by fireworks. Another meal is served for family and guests. After this, the groom's family brings three or four live turkeys to the bride's house as a symbolic bride price, accompanied by a band. Sometimes this traditional offering is replaced by dishes, clothes, other animals or other gifts. After this, the wedding is further celebrated with drinks and wedding cake. At weddings and other festivals, there is a person designated as the "Chigule." This person is an older, respected member of the community, who acts as a master of ceremonies, asking guests to enjoy the food and beverages prepared for the occasion.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

[[Guelaguetza]] is celebrated each year in July, with food drink and dance. [[Las Posadas]] are celebrated  in December with a local style of [[atole]] called "champurrado."&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;  [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is a two-day celebration here, celebrated at the house of a "mayordomo," who is chosen each year. The mayordomo is in charge of an image called the "Señor del Coro" which is a crucifix to which has been attributed miracles. On the second night, a new mayordomo is chosen for the coming year and when the process is concluded, fireworks are set off to allow the village to know. Then a procession to the new house takes place, bringing food, [[mezcal]] and a live turkey.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

The feast of Our Lady of the Assumption is celebrated in August, beginning with a [[novena]]. Processions are held where youths carry litters adorned with crepe paper, [[bougainvillea]] flowers and other things. There are also "fireworks castles" (structures laden with small rockets which move parts), music and a large supper, usually based on beans and rice. On the 15th of August, there is a special Mass, and another [[communal meal]] served by the young people of the town. Municipal authorities are present and the evening concludes with a dance and amusement rides.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; 
  
[[Holy Week]] celebrations here are a mixture of Christian and pagan elements. Holy Tuesday is celebrated at home with family and friends. The traditional drink for this day is called "tejate" and is prepared by a designated man and either his mother or his wife. The traditional meal s fish with white beans, with a sweet called "maja blanca" made from ground rice, milk, cinnamon and sugar for dessert. On Holy Thursday, a staging of the Last Supper takes place, which is usually done by the town elders. On Good Friday, streets are cleaned and prepared for Easter Sunday, when the day is celebrated with food, drink and dance on the street. This celebration lasts into Monday.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

[[Day of the Dead]] celebrations begin on midnight 31 October, when those with deceased loved ones gather in the cemetery to light the tombs with candles and decorate them with [[Mexican marigold]]s and other flowers. These people are greeted on the morning of 31 October by municipal authorities who bring a musical band and offer tea and coffee. Religious brotherhoods also arrive with banners and standards. On November 1, the dead continue to be honored in the home, with a traditional meal of mole, tamales and beans. On 2 November, is called the "day of godchildren, "co-parents" (compadres), friends and family" as the dead are often referred to. On this day are eaten bread, hot chocolate and fruit, with the aim of saying goodbye to the deceased who have been visiting. Late in the day, another meal with mezcal or beer may be served.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

The Fiesta del Nacimiento (Feast of the Birth) occurs at the house of the mayordomo of a Christ child image. This mayordomo serves for a year and there is a minimum of a five-year wait to be the mayordomo. A daughter of the mayordomo is chosen to sing a lullaby to the image. The event extends from the 24th to the 26th of December. On the 24th, a large number of children gather at the house of the mayordomo to participate in the lullaby. The mayordomo's daughter leads this event and is called the "madrina del Niño Dios" (godmother of the Christ Child). After the lullaby, a meal is served to all the participants, which is usually fish with white beans, hot chocolate and bread. After this, there is a procession in the streets with a musical band towards the church where [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] is held. The 25th and 26th are mostly celebrated at home, with food and drink.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt;

==Green glazed pottery of Atzompa==
{{main|green glazed pottery of Atzompa}}
[[File:Marti¦ün Mario Enri¦üquez Lo¦üpez and his family, innovators in green-glazed ceramics, Santa Mari¦üa Atzompa, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|Martin Mario Enriquez Lopez with family and glazed pieces from their workshop]]
About 90% of the people in the town proper are dedicated to making pottery, making it the basis of the town's economy. Most of this pottery is created for kitchen use such as for cooking, baking and serving.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; The clay is mined from an area called San Lorenzo Cacautepec, four km from the town center. It is still carried by burro along paths used by the town's grandfathers. After the clay arrives at the workshop, the men break and work to make the clay uniform, mixing it and adding water. All members of the family, including the children work. The potter's wheels are operated by foot, and date back to the pre-Hispanic era. After a piece is molded, it is set aside for eight days before firing. The color and shine is due to the glazing process, which was introduced in the 16th century by cleric Alonso Figueroa and has remained mostly unchanged since then. The first firing with without the glaze, with the pieces emerging in their natural color and can be used in this form. However, very few pieces of this type will sell and sell at a low price. While the glaze is not inexpensive, it has become necessary to make the pottery acceptable to the market. The second firing to harden and adhere the glaze.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt;
[[File:Green-glazed ceramic pieces by late Guadalupe Aguilar Guerrero, Santa Mari¦üa Atzompa, Oaxaca.jpg|thumb|left|Green glazed ware by the late Guadalupe Aguilar Guerrero]]
The green color and shine of the pottery is a result of a lead monoxide glaze, which can leach into the foods that the pottery holds. The local people here have been warned of the dangers of the continuous use of the lead pottery but the warnings are unheeded.  Studies have shown that people in potters' communities such as Atompa, where lead glaze is used have unusually high levels of the substance in their blood. The exposure comes not only from the making of the pottery, but the use of it to simmer sauces and stews. With time and repeated use, the lead leaches from the glaze into the food. In the 1990s, the Mexican government devised a glaze for pottery which is lead free as a response to lead poisoning problems in the country. A 1995 study showed that 44% of children under five years of age in working-class families had high levels of lead in their bloodstreams. Much of the push towards lead-free pottery has been due to economics rather than health when the U.S. restricted imports of Mexican pottery due to lead concerns. Making pottery is a matter of culture and survival for Atzompa and many other poor communities in Mexico.&lt;ref name="jpreston"/&gt;

While almost all of Atzompa's pottery is of the traditional green-glazed variety, since the 1980s, a potter by the name of Dolores Porras has created the first glazed natural color and multicolored glazed pottery.&lt;ref name="colorverde"/&gt; Porras developed a white translucent glaze on which to paint colors such as bright oranges, blues, greens and yellows. Each of her pieces are done by hand and are decorated with figures such as borders, mermaids, flowers and iguanas. She has been invited to give workshops in the United States, where she learned about lead-free glazes and has applied these to her work. She has not been able to work for the last years due to Parkinson's disease and diminished sight. She remains poor and dependent on her family for support. In 2010, a ceremony to honor her innovative work was organized by the Arden Rothstein of the [[Friends of Oaxacan Folk Art]] Association.&lt;ref name="extranjeros"/&gt;

==Archeological site==
Since 2009, archeological work has been taking place in an area just south of the town center. A number of significant constructions have been excavated including structures called the Casa de Oriental (East House) and Casa de Altares (House of the Altars) and the Central Shrine of Atzompa which is larger than its counterpart in Monte Alban proper. Next to these is a complex of domestic units, sunken patios and a pyramidal platform.&lt;ref name="pelota"/&gt;

However, the main find has been a 45-meter-long Mesoamerican ball court with two smaller courts next to it. These courts are surrounded pyramidal structures.  The 45-meter court is the largest ever found in the Monte Alban area and investigations indicate that this was the principal ball court for the city, rather than any of the ball courts that are in the Monte Alban site itself. This ball court is situated such that players would have full view of the city located above them. The two smaller courts are secondary and probably used for training ball players.&lt;ref name="pelota"/&gt;

The site was initially explored in the 1930s by Jorge Acosta. He was only able to examine the ends of the large ball court. He speculated that the constructions at this site were ceremonial and defensive in nature, constructed in the 7th to 9th centuries to protect a growing Monte Alban.&lt;ref name="pelota"/&gt; Formal excavation was not considered for the site until recently due to its distance from the main Monte Alban site. The site is still being excavated with plans to open it to the public in 2012.&lt;ref name="hallan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Hallan el juego de pelota más grande de Monte Albán |url= http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/422615.hallan-el-juego-de-pelota-mas-grande-de-monte.html |agency=Notimex |newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon |location=Torreon, Coahuila |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Found the largest ball court of Monte Alban }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2010, work has intensified in building the infrastructure needed for the Santa Maria Atzompa archeological site, to be opened to the public in 2012 as an adjunct to the Monte Alban site. A laboratory and security booths have been built, paid for by the [[INAH]]. The laboratory is for the testing and dating of ceramic pieces and other artifacts. Walking paths are being constructed by the state government.&lt;ref name="laboratorio"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inah.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4097 |title= Nuevo laboratorio en Atzompa  |date=January 18, 2010 |publisher=INAH |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=New laboratory in Atzompa |accessdate=March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The archeological work displaced about 100 people from their homes, but the promise of tourism in the future has satisfied the community.&lt;ref name="hallan"/&gt;  As of November 2012 this site is open to the public.

==The municipality==
As municipal seat, the town of Santa María Atzompa is the local governing authority for itself and the communities of Montealbán, San Jerónimo Yahuiche, San José Hidalgo, Santa Catarina Montaño, La Soledad, La Cañada, Rancho Concepción, La Cañadita, Loma del Puente, La Raya de Yahuiche, Salida a San Lorenzo, Los Sibaja (Calle del Canal), Colonia Odisea, El Rincón, Paraje Río Chiquito, Loma del Paredón and Paraje Loma de la Virgen.&lt;ref name="INEGI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=Spanish |accessdate=March 17, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msVc9rGy?url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archivedate=January 18, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality has a total population of 19,876, 85% of which live in the town proper,(inegi) and covers an area of 22.96km2.&lt;ref name="encmuc"/&gt; 1,726 people speak an indigenous language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2416">'''Social murder''' is a phrase used by [[Friedrich Engels]] in his 1845 work ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England|The Condition of the Working-Class in England]]'' whereby "the class which at present holds social and political control" (i.e. the [[bourgeoisie]]) "places hundreds of [[proletarians]] in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death".&lt;ref name="Engels1845"&gt;[[Friedrich Engels|Engels, Friedrich]] (2009) [1845].

'''Te Wairoa''' (also known as '''The Buried Village''') is a [[ghost town|deserted village]] located close to the shore of [[Lake Tarawera]] in [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]]. It was a [[Māori people|Māori]] and European settlement founded in 1848 by the Revd [[Seymour Mills Spencer]] where visitors would stay on their way to visit the [[Pink and White Terraces]].  The village was destroyed by the [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] of the volcano [[Mount Tarawera]] on June 10, 1886. 120 people died in the eruption, many of them in other villages closer to the volcano.&lt;ref name="deaths"&gt;[http://www.natlib.govt.nz/collections/highlighted-items/the-mt-tarawera-eruption] National Library of New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;The site of one of these villages (Kokotaia) was instrumental in the recent rediscovery of the Pink and White Terrace locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunn|first=Rex|last2=Nolden|first2=Sascha|date=2017-06-07|title=Forensic cartography with Hochstetter’s 1859 Pink and White Terraces survey: Te Otukapuarangi and Te Tarata|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/03036758.2017.1329748|issn=0303-6758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buried Village is open to the public and shows the excavated ruins of the village, recovered relics on display in a museum and the history of the eruption. It is located 14 kilometres southeast of [[Rotorua]] on Tarawera Road.

A Māori meeting house named Hinemihi which provided shelter to the people of Te Wairoa village during the eruption was relocated in 1892 to [[Clandon Park]] as an ornamental garden building and a souvenir of [[William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow]].&lt;ref name="Hinemihi"&gt;[http://www.hinemihi.co.uk/page.php?id=24 Hinemihi], Hinemihi.co.uk.

Around three to four generations of the Smith Family have had ownership of the land at Te Wairoa.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The first generation of the Smith family bought the site of Te Wairoa from the CMS missionary, Rev. [[Seymour Mills Spencer]], at Te Wairoa. Since then the Smith family have run the excavating of Te Wairoa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6673">{{About||the 1999 book by Richard Coyne|Technoromanticism (book)}}
[[Stéphan Barron]] was the first to develop the concept of Technoromanticism between 1991 and 1996 for his doctoral thesis at the University Paris VIII.&lt;ref&gt;The term "Technoromantisme" is quoted several times in Barron's doctaral thesis "Art planétaire et Romantisme Techno-écologique", Université Paris VIII, 1997 http://www.technoromanticism.com/theorie/TEXTES_THESE_HDR/these.html&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme of his research is what he calls “Technoromantisme/Technoromanticism”, a neologism which he created and which has been adopted by other English-speaking researchers. Technoromantism is the theory of links between art and new technologies, within the context of the threats posed to nature by technoscience and economic development. Technoromanticism also seeks to analyse the return of the human body within technological arts, formulating the hypothesis that a technological society needs a corporeal rebalancing of perceptions. Delayed for editorial reasons, his book ''Technoromantisme'' was published by l'Harmattan in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;''Technoromantisme'', Ed. L’Harmattan, Paris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; '''Technoromanticism''' is a term used to indicate those aspects of contemporary culture that ascribe to advanced technologies the capacity to promote the power of the imagination, to restore the role of genius and to bring about a unity; in other words that revive and perpetuate the legacy of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century artistic and philosophical movement known as [[Romanticism]],&lt;ref&gt;Furst, L. R. 1969. ''Romanticism in Perspective: A Comparative Study of Aspects of the Romantic Movements in England, France and Germany''. London: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; but by technological means. The term was used in 1999 in a book that bore the title ''Technoromanticism''&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Richard. 1999. ''Technoromanticism: Digital Narrative, Holism, and the Romance of the Real''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; outlining evidence of romanticism in many commentaries on digital technology at the time.

As such, technoromanticism attributes to technology the capacity to redeem humankind from its problems and bring about [[techno-utopia]]s. According to this thesis, technoromanticism is [[Idealism|idealistic]], it also looks backwards, seeing in advanced technologies the opportunity to return to craft values, analogous to [[William Morris]]’ romance with Medieval guilds. It appeals to narratives of wholeness, against [[rationalism]] which is putatively reductive. Moves to invoke digital networks as a means of returning human society and the world to an organic whole&lt;ref&gt;Moravec, Hans P. 1988. ''Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; could be regarded as technoromantic, as well as digital technology’s supposed religiously redemptive aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Wertheim, Margaret. 1999. ''The Pearly Gates of Cyberspace: A History of Space from Dante to the Internet''. London: Virago.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polemical character==
The term “technoromanticism” seems to draw resonances from its opposition to the concept of techno''rationalism'', targeted by [[Critical theory|critical theorists]] such as [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcuse, Herbert. 1991. ''One-Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; One motivation for describing certain aspects of digital culture as ‘’technoromantic’’ may be to signal that what many people claim about advanced networked computing is old fashioned and embedded in traditional ways of thinking, however innovative the technology. The term also buys into debates within the [[design methods]] movement about Rationalism and Romanticism, or in philosophy between [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivism]] and [[subjectivism]], particularly as articulated by the philosopher [[Richard J. Bernstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Richard J. 1983. ''Beyond Objectivism and Relativism''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also encourage critique of certain commentators who seem to claim they are adopting postmodern ways of thinking&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, Sherry. 1995. ''Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet''. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson.&lt;/ref&gt; when in fact they may be referencing romanticism, or lapsing into what [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] describe negatively as “armchair phenomenology.”&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, George, and Mark Johnson. 1980. ''Metaphors We Live By''. Chicago, Ill.: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the term==
Technoromanticism is therefore mainly a pejorative term for a naïve attitude to what digital technologies are and may accomplish. As such the label may misrepresent the profound aspects of the philosophical movement of Romanticism as advanced by [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and on whom many radical twentieth century thinkers have drawn, particularly [[Martin Heidegger]]. There are those who deliberately label their activity as technoromantic, such as the artist Stéphan Barron, who has adopted the word in a positive way to categorise his art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technoromanticism.com/ Technoromantisme&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oppositions to technoromanticism==
The most potent opposition to technoromanticism seems to come less from a return to rationalism than from arguments advanced from the positions of [[Embodied philosophy|embodiment]], [[situated cognition]], [[Pragmatism]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]], and the strategies of [[Deconstruction]] as outlined in the context of digital computing by Winograd and Flores,&lt;ref&gt;Winograd, Terry, and Fernando Flores. 1986.

[[File:Appeal of Minin.jpg|thumb|Minin appeals to the people of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] to raise a volunteer army against [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish forces]], by [[Konstantin Makovsky]].]]

The '''Time of Troubles''' ({{lang-ru|Смутное время}}, ''Smutnoe vremya'') was a period of [[History of Russia|Russian history]] comprising the years of [[interregnum]] between the death of the last [[Tsardom of Russia|Russian]] [[Tsar]] of the [[Rurik Dynasty]], [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor Ivanovich]], in 1598, and the establishment of the [[Romanov Dynasty]] in 1613. In 1601–03, Russia suffered [[Russian famine of 1601–03|a famine that killed one-third of the population]], about two million.  At the time, during the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)| Polish–Russian War (1605–18)]] (known as the ''Dimitriads''), Russia was occupied by the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and suffered from many civil uprisings, [[usurper|usurpers]] and [[False Dmitry|impostors]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

==Causes==
After Feodor's death, his [[brother-in-law]] and closest advisor, ''[[boyar]]'' [[Boris Godunov]], who had already acted as [[regent]] for the mentally-challenged Feodor, was elected his successor by a [[Zemsky Sobor|Great National Assembly (''Zemsky Sobor'')]]. Godunov's short reign (1598–1605) was not as successful as his administration under the weak Feodor.

Extremely poor harvests were encountered in 1601–03, with night time temperatures in all summer months often below freezing, wrecking crops; see [[Russian famine of 1601–03]].&lt;ref&gt;Borisenkov E, Pasetski V. ''The Thousand-Year Annals of the Extreme Meteorological Phenomena''. {{ISBN|5-244-00212-0}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a global trend in [[climate change]], known as the [[General Crisis]]. One probable cause of climatic changes was the eruption of [[Huaynaputina]] volcano in [[Peru]] in 1600.&lt;ref name="Geology"&gt;[http://www.geologytimes.com/Research/1600_Eruption_Caused_Global_Disruption.asp "1600 Eruption Caused Global Disruption"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215095449/http://www.geologytimes.com/research/1600_Eruption_Caused_Global_Disruption.asp |date=2011-02-15 }}, ''Geology Times'', 25 Apr 2008, accessed 13 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24467948/ Andrea Thompson, "Volcano in 1600 caused global disruption"], MSNBC.com, 5 May 2008, accessed 13 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=08042402 | title = The 1600 eruption of Huaynaputina in Peru caused global disruption | work = Science Centric | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100428052829/http://www.sciencecentric.com/news/article.php?q=08042402 | archivedate = 28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread hunger led to the mass starvation of about two million Russians, a third of the population. 

The government distributed money and food for poor people in [[Moscow]]. This led to refugees flocking to the capital and increasing the economic disorganization. The [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] faction, headed by the [[Romanovs]], considered it a disgrace to obey a [[boyar]]. Conspiracies were frequent. Rural districts were desolated by famine and [[plague (disease)|plague]]. Large bands of armed [[brigands]] roamed the country committing all manner of atrocities. The [[Don Cossacks]] on the frontier were restless. The central government demonstrated it could not keep order.

Under the influence of the great nobles who had unsuccessfully opposed the election of Godunov, the general discontent was expressed as hostility to him as a usurper. Rumours circulated that the late tsar's younger brother [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Dmitri]], thought to be dead, was still alive and in hiding.

==False Dmitri==

[[File:Tushino.jpg|thumb|250px|''In the Time of Troubles'' by [[Sergei Vasilyevich Ivanov|Sergey Ivanov]].]]

In 1603 a [[False Dmitri I|man calling himself Dmitri]]—first of the so-called False Dmitris—and professing to be the rightful heir to the throne, appeared in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The real [[Dmitry of Uglich|prince Dmitry of Uglich]], son of Ivan IV, had been stabbed to death at early age, before his brother Feodor's death, either by accident or by Godunov's order. The mysterious individual who was impersonating him was regarded as the rightful heir by many of the population. 

He attracted support both in Russia and outside its borders, particularly in the Polish Commonwealth and the [[Papal States]]. Factions in the Polish Commonwealth saw him as a tool to extend their influence over Russia, or at least gain wealth in return for their support. The Papacy saw it as an opportunity to increase the hold of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] over the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Russians.

A few months later in 1603, Polish forces crossed the frontier with a small force of 4,000 Poles, Lithuanians, Russian exiles, German mercenaries and Cossacks from the [[Dnieper]] and the [[Don River, Russia|Don]], in what marked the beginning of the Polish Commonwealth's intervention in Russia, or the [[Dymitriads|Dymitriad]] wars. Although the Polish Commonwealth had not officially declared war on Russia - [[Sigismund III Vasa]] quietly supported the intervention, but the Commonwealth was too preoccupied with its conflicts with Sweden and Turkey to start another war with Russia - some powerful [[magnate]]s decided to support False Dmitri with their own forces and money, in the expectation of rich rewards afterward. False Dmitri was married ''[[per procura]]'' to [[Marina Mniszech]], and immediately after Godunov's death in 1605, he made his triumphal entry into Moscow.

==Shuisky's reign==
The reign of False Dimitri was short. The new monarch, who married the Polish Marina Mniszech in exchange for promises of vast grants of land and wealth, converted to Catholicism and relied upon Polish Jesuits and Polish nobles that played a prominent role at his court, as well as on Mniszech's private armies,&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;Daniel Z. Stone. The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386-1795. University of Washington Press, 2014. P. 140&lt;/ref&gt; was seen by many as a tool of Poland. He became unpopular very quickly and was overthrown and killed by armed mobs during the Moscow uprising in May 1606.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Anderson. The Origins of the Modern European State System, 1494-1618. Routledge, 2014. P. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his Polish-Lithuanian advisors were also killed or imprisoned during the rebellion.&lt;ref name=Stone/&gt;

Shuisky seized power and was elected tsar by an assembly composed of his faction, but the change did not satisfy the Russian boyars, Commonwealth magnates, Cossacks, or the German mercenaries, and soon a new impostor, likewise [[False Dmitriy II|calling himself Dmitri]], son and heir of [[Ivan the Terrible]], came forward as the rightful heir. Like his predecessor, he enjoyed the protection and support of the Polish–Lithuanian magnates. After Shuisky [[De la Gardie Campaign|signed an alliance with Sweden]], the [[king of Poland|king of the Commonwealth]], [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]], seeing the Russian–Swedish alliance as a threat, resolved to intervene and began the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)]].
[[File:Minin &amp; Pozharskiy 01.JPG|right|thumb|[[Pozharsky and Minin monument]] (1804–1816) in front of [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]]]]

==Second occupation==
Polish–Lithuanian troops crossed the Russian borders and laid [[Siege of Smolensk (1609–11)|siege to the fortress of Smolensk]]. After the combined Russo–Swedish forces were destroyed at the [[Battle of Klushino]], Shuisky was forced to abdicate. Before False Dmitri II could gain the throne, the Polish commander, [[voivode]], and [[magnate]] [[Stanisław Żółkiewski]], put forward a rival candidate: Sigismund's son, [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław]]. Some people in Moscow swore allegiance to him on condition of his maintaining [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] and granting certain privileges to them. On this understanding, they allowed Polish troops to enter the city and occupy [[the Kremlin]].

The [[Sigismund III Vasa|Polish king]] opposed the compromise, deciding to take the throne for himself and to convert Russia to [[Roman Catholicism]]. The contending factions were opposed and his plan aroused the [[anti-Catholic]] and [[anti-Polish]] feelings in Russia. The Swedes disapproved as they were [[Polish–Swedish wars|rivals of the Poles]] on the [[Ingria|Baltic coast]]. They [[Ingrian War|declared war on Russia]], supporting a [[False Dmitriy III|false Dmitri of their choice]] in [[Ivangorod]].

Russia was in a [[Failed state|critical condition]]. The throne was vacant. The great nobles ([[boyar]]s) quarrelled among themselves. Orthodox [[Patriarch Hermogenes]] was imprisoned. Catholic [[Poles]] occupied the [[Moscow Kremlin]] and Smolensk. The [[Protestant]] Swedes occupied [[Novgorod]]. Continuing [[Tatar invasions|Tatar raids]] left the south borderlands of Russia completely depopulated and devastated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allempires.info/article/index.php?q=The_Crimean_Khanate The Tatar Khanate of Crimea], allempires.net&lt;/ref&gt; 

Enormous bands of brigands swarmed everywhere. Tens of thousands died in battles and riots. On 17–19 March 1611, the Polish and German mercenaries suppressed riots in Moscow. They massacred 7,000 Muscovites and set the city on fire.&lt;ref name="Solovyov"&gt;[[Sergey Solovyov]], ''History of Russia from the Earliest Times'', [http://lib.ru/HISTORY/SOLOVIEV/solv8.txt Vol. 8].&lt;/ref&gt; Many other cities were also devastated or weakened. For example, on 22 September 1612, the Poles and Lithuanians exterminated the population and clergy of [[Vologda]].&lt;ref name="Solovyov"/&gt;

==Struggle for independence==
The nation rose together under the leadership of [[Kuzma Minin]], a [[Nizhny Novgorod]] merchant, and [[Dmitry Pozharsky|Prince Dmitry Pozharsky]]. After the battle for Moscow on 22 October 1612 [[Old Style]]&lt;ref name="Solovyov" /&gt; (1 November [[New Style]]), the invaders retreated to [[the Kremlin]], and on 24–27 October O.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolay Kostomarov]], ''Russian History in Biographies of its main figures'', [http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kostom/kostom30.htm Chap. 30].&lt;/ref&gt; (3–6 November N.S.) the nearby Polish army was forced to retreat. The garrison in the Kremlin surrendered to the triumphant Pozharsky. The festival of [[Unity Day (Russia)|National Unity Day]] commemorating this event on November 4 was held annually until the rise of communism, when it was replaced by celebrations for the October Revolution. National Unity Day was reinstated by President Putin in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://themoscowtimes.com/news/what-exactly-is-national-unity-day-29172|title=The Moscow Times|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Zemsky Sobor|Grand National Assembly]] elected as tsar 16-year-old [[Mikhail I of Russia|Michael Romanov]], the young son of the [[Patriarch Filaret (Feodor Romanov)|metropolitan Philaret]]. He was connected by marriage with the late dynasty and, according to the legend, had been saved from the enemies by a heroic peasant, [[Ivan Susanin]]. After taking power, the new Tsar ordered the 3-year-old son of the False Dmitri II to be hanged, and had Dmitri's wife Maryna strangled.

The [[Ingrian War]]s against Sweden lasted until the [[Treaty of Stolbovo]] in 1617. Russia's  [[Dymitriads|Dymitriad]] wars against the Commonwealth would last until the [[Peace of Deulino]] in 1619. While gaining peace through the treaties, both nations forced Russia to make some territorial concessions, though they lost the majority of them over the coming centuries. Most importantly, the crisis was instrumental in unifying all classes of the Russian society around the [[Romanov]] tsars and established foundations for the powerful [[Russian Empire]].

==Cultural allusions==
[[File:Feodor Chaliapin as Ivan Susanin.jpg|thumb|[[Feodor Shalyapin]] as ''[[Ivan Susanin]]'' in the opera ''[[A Life for the Tsar]]'']]
This period of the "Time of Troubles" has inspired many artists and playwrights in Russia and beyond. The three most popular topics are the Pozharsky/Minin liberation of Moscow, the struggle between Boris Godunov and [[False Dmitry I|False Dmitry]], and the story of [[Ivan Susanin]], a peasant who was said to sacrifice himself to lead Poles away from Mikhail Romanov.

Russian and Polish artists have painted numerous works based on these events.

Numerous histories have been written, as well. In 2001, [[Chester Dunning]], a specialist in Russian history at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] published the nearly 700-page ''Russia's First Civil War: The Time of Troubles and the Founding of the Romanov Dynasty''. Twelve years in the research and writing, his work was a [[History Book Club]] selection published by the [[Pennsylvania State University Press]]. Dunning's thesis is that modern Russia begins in 1613 with the founding of the Romanov dynasty. He covers the Time of Troubles and their contribution to the founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NUYtSJaO8cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Russia's+First+Civil+War:+The+Time+of+Troubles+and+the+Founding+of+the+Romanov+Dynasty#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Russia's First Civil War: The Time of Troubles and the Founding of the Romanov Dynasty|publisher=[[Pennsylvania State University Press]]|date=2001|isbn=0-271-02074-1|accessdate=October 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tuesday, September 11 ===
{{main|Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks}}

=== Wednesday, September 12 ===
*'''2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': [[CBS]] reports that a car packed with explosives has been stopped on the [[George Washington Bridge]]. The [[New Jersey]] police claim there were enough explosives to destroy the entire bridge. Apparently the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has denied the report. According to a later report, three men have been arrested, but there were no explosives involved. They were arrested because they had been seen [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack/Celebrations|celebrating]] the attack.
*Before '''3:15&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' reports that at least five Arab men have been identified as suspects. Two of them were brothers, and one a trained pilot. Their passports have been traced to the [[United Arab Emirates]]. A car, rented in [[Portland, Maine]], has been seized from the [[Logan International Airport]] garage, containing flight training manuals in Arabic. According to [[CNN]], FBI can neither confirm nor deny this. The men had been in a fight with a man shortly before take-off; this man later recalled the incident and called the police.
*Before '''3:50&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' reports that [[Osama bin Laden]] has given a speech denying any connection to the attacks, which he called admirable.
*'''4:35&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': [[CNN]] reports that search warrants have been issued in south [[Florida]] because of information from the passenger lists of the hijacked planes.
*After '''7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department|PAPD]] Officer [[John McLoughlin (9/11 attacks survivor)|John McLoughlin]], who was in an underground corridor between the two towers when the South Tower collapsed, is pulled alive from the rubble of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].
*'''10:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': Congress reconvenes.
*'''10:53&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': President [[George W. Bush]] holds a cabinet meeting, saying that the attacks "were more than acts of terror. They were acts of war." Bush later that day tours the Pentagon to oversee{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} the rescue and recovery efforts.
*'''12:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.''' (approximately), Genelle Guzman-McMillan is pulled from the rubble of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, and is the last person recovered alive from  the buildings' collapse zones.&lt;ref&gt;John Cloud, "[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020909/asurvivor.html A Miracle's Cost]," ''Time'', Sept. 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1:10&amp;nbsp;p.m.''': [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents storm the Westin Hotel in Boston to investigate a room rented by a passenger on one plane. They encounter and detain three people in the room and call in a bomb squad to investigate a suspicious package.
*'''3:58&amp;nbsp;p.m.''': [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] announces they have evidence showing the [[White House]] and [[Air Force One]] were intended targets of the attacks. Later this is recanted, and blamed on administration staffers misunderstanding the security information they received.
*'''5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.''': Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] announces that some of the hijackers were pilots trained in the US.
*'''7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.''': Candlelight vigils are held in [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]], [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], [[Central Park]], and various other locations in New York City.
*'''Late evening''': ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' reports that an anti-Arab rally was held by a crowd of a few hundred people near [[Bridgeview mosque]] in [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]], Illinois. Three were arrested by the over 100 policemen there, two for [[disorderly conduct]] and one for [[reckless driving]].

=== Thursday, September 13 ===
*A few commercial airliners return to the skies and some airports reopen slowly with strict security measures from the FAA.
*Before '''1:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.''': German police raid an apartment in [[Hamburg]], apparently at the behest of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], believed to have been used by suspect passengers on the airline flight list. It is believed to be the first police action outside the U.S. connected with the attack. Two people are taken into provisional custody, one is an airport worker. Both were later released, but re-arrested in late 2002.
*The data recorder from United Airlines Flight 93 is recovered.
*The United States [[National Transportation Safety Board]], which usually investigates air disasters, issued a [http://www.ntsb.gov/Pressrel/2001/010913.htm press release] stating that the NTSB would assist the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and that the FBI would be "the lead investigative agency".
*Between '''4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.''' and '''5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.''': 10 people were detained at New York airports, reportedly including people who had boarded planes under false pretenses, people who had been trained to fly aircraft at the same schools as the previous terrorists, and people who had attempted to bring knives and other weapons past airport security. Some of these people had already been identified by the FBI as potential suspects. Three were removed from planes ready for departure by police SWAT teams, one resisted arrest. It was later found that none of them was planning a hijacking.
*It is announced that [[Ahmed Shah Massoud]], a military leader of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance|Northern Alliance]], died on September 9 from wounds received during a Taliban suicide attack.
*On the orders of Queen [[Elizabeth II]], the '[[Star-Spangled Banner]]' is played during the changing of the guard at [[Buckingham Palace]]. This unprecedented act was witnessed by a huge crowd, many singing along.
*At the orders of [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Russia]] observes a moment's silence at noontime ([[Moscow]] time) with flags placed at half-staff throughout Russia "in memory of terrorist acts' victims".
*At '''8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.''', the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] holds a special live broadcast of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' in [[Houston, Texas]] dedicated to the victims and heroes of the attacks. All storylines are put on hold for this tribute show, as various wrestlers and other individuals give their best wishes to the families of the victims and congratulate all of the workers and firefighters in New York. This is the first major assemblage for an American sporting event following the attacks.

=== Friday, September 14 ===
The National Day of Prayer and Remembrance

*Church and memorial services held throughout the world. These include a special service held in London, which was attended by a black-clad Queen and 1,500 mourners. A three-minute silence at noon Paris time was observed throughout Europe. "The Star-Spangled Banner" is performed or sung in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] and at mass gatherings in [[Edinburgh]], [[Paris]], and [[Ottawa]]. National days of mourning are observed in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[South Korea]]. Ireland was brought to a standstill on the day, because the government had ordered schools, offices, and stores across the country closed because a public holiday as part of the national day of mourning had been declared.
*The [[New York City Office of Emergency Management]] completes setup of an Emergency Operations Center after a 32-hour construction marathon, at Pier 92. This facility served to replace the Office of Emergency Management office formerly housed in the basement of [[7 World Trade Center]], and destroyed on the afternoon of September 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/other/sub_news_pages/911/response_p2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427054409/http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/other/sub_news_pages/911/response_p2.html |date=April 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was no hijacking attempts at either airport on the 13th, only suspicious circumstances.
*AM, The Pentagon reports recovering both [[flight data recorder|black boxes]] from flight AA 77 which crashed into the Pentagon.
*AM, The [[Template:9-11 hijackers|names]] of the 19 suspected [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] are released by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/091401hj.htm FBI Announces List of 19 Hijackers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221101634/https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/091401hj.htm |date=2015-02-21 }}, ''FBI, national Press Release'' September 14, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

*The Lebanese [[Hezbollah]]-owned satellite channel [[Al-Manar]] comes out with a news piece arguing that the Israeli secret services and [[Zionist]] supporters of them were most likely responsible, and claiming that 4,000 [[Israel]]is had stayed away from work at the World Trade Center that day.

The British newspaper ''The Observer'' published this translation, provided for ''The New York Times'' by ''Capital Communications Group'', a Washington-based international consulting firm, and by Imad Musa, a translator.  Some notable excerpts: ..."Make an oath to die and renew your intentions..."... "Check your weapon before you leave and long before you leave. (You must make your knife sharp and must not discomfort your animal during the slaughter). " ... "All of their equipment and gates and technology will not prevent, nor harm, except by God's will. The believers do not fear such things. ..." ... "When the confrontation begins, strike like champions who do not want to go back to this world. Shout, 'Allahu Akbar,' because this strikes fear in the hearts of the non-believers. God said: 'Strike above the neck, and strike at all of their extremities.' Know that the gardens of paradise are waiting for you in all their beauty, and the women of paradise are waiting, calling out, 'Come hither, friend of God.' They have dressed in their most beautiful clothing..." ... "If you slaughter, do not cause the discomfort of those you are killing, because this is one of the practices of the prophet, peace be upon him..." ... "Do not seek revenge for yourself. Strike for God's sake..." ... "Then implement the way of the prophet in taking prisoners. Take prisoners and kill them. As Almighty God said: 'No prophet should have prisoners until he has soaked the land with blood... " ... "How beautiful it is for one to read God's words, such as: 'And those who prefer the afterlife over this world should fight for the sake of God.' And His words: 'Do not suppose that those who are killed for the sake of God are dead; they are alive ... '." ... "Either end your life while praying, seconds before the target, or make your last words: 'There is no God but God, Muhammad is His messenger'."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prior to the 20th century===
* c. 1717 &lt;ref&gt;This date is commonly misreported as 1725 or 1727, an error deriving from the belief that a 1727 publication of Schulze's account of experiments he says he undertook about two years earlier is the original source. In fact, it is a reprint of a 1719 publication and the date of the experiments is therefore circa 1717. The dated contents page of the true original can be seen [http://digitale.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/vd18/content/pageview/4921254 here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221153904/http://digitale.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/vd18/content/pageview/4921254 |date=2015-02-21 }} (retrieved 2015-02-21)&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Johann Heinrich Schulze]] makes fleeting sun prints of words by using [[stencil]]s, sunlight, and a bottled mixture of [[chalk]] and [[silver nitrate]] in [[nitric acid]], simply as an interesting way to demonstrate that the substance inside the bottle darkens where it is exposed to light.
* c. 1800 – [[Thomas Wedgwood (photographer)|Thomas Wedgwood]] conceives of making permanent pictures of [[camera obscura|camera]] images by using a durable surface coated with a light-sensitive chemical. He succeeds only in producing [[silhouette]]s and other shadow images, and is unable to make them permanent.
* 1816 – [[Nicéphore Niépce]] succeeds in making [[negative (photography)|negative]] photographs of camera images on paper coated with [[silver chloride]], but cannot adequately "fix" them to stop them from darkening all over when exposed to light for viewing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/invus1.html Niépce House Museum: History of Photography, part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308174022/http://www.niepce.org/pagus/invus1.html |date=2014-03-08 }}. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1822 – [[Nicéphore Niépce]] abandons [[silver halide]] photography as hopelessly impermanent and tries using thin coatings of [[Bitumen of Judea]] on metal and glass. He creates the first fixed, permanent [[photograph]], a copy of an engraving of [[Pope Pius VII]], by [[contact print]]ing in direct sunlight without a camera or lens. It is later destroyed; the earliest surviving example of his [[heliography|"heliographic process"]] is from 1825.&lt;ref name="utexas"/&gt;
* 1824 – [[Nicéphore Niépce]] makes the first durable, light-fast camera photograph, similar to his surviving 1826-1827 photograph on pewter but created on the surface of a [[Lithographic limestone|lithographic stone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/invus3.html Niépce House Museum: History of Photography, part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316220551/http://www.niepce.org/pagus/invus3.html |date=2014-03-16 }}. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is destroyed in the course of subsequent experiments.
* 1826 or 1827 – [[Nicéphore Niépce]] makes what is now [[View from the Window at Le Gras|the earliest surviving photograph from nature]],&lt;ref name="utexas"/&gt; a landscape. It requires an exposure in the camera that lasts at least eight hours and probably several days.
* 1834 – [[Hércules Florence]], a French-Brazilian painter and the isolate inventor of photography in Brazil, coined the word ''photographie'' for his technique, at least four years before [[John Herschel]] coined the English word ''photography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hercule Florence: El descubrimiento de la fotografía en Brasil | author = Boris Kossoy | publisher = Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia| isbn = 968-03-0020-X | year = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wCoQAAAACAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1835 – [[Henry Fox Talbot]] produces durable [[silver chloride]] camera negatives on paper and conceives the two-step negative-positive procedure used in most non-electronic photography up to the present.&lt;ref name="Schaaf1"&gt;[http://foxtalbot.dmu.ac.uk/talbot/biography.html "WHF Talbot: Biography"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721213550/http://foxtalbot.dmu.ac.uk/talbot/biography.html |date=2011-07-21 }}, a concise account by widely acknowledged and extensively published Talbot expert Larry J. Schaaf. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1839 – [[Louis Daguerre]] publicly introduces his [[daguerreotype]] process, which produces highly detailed permanent photographs on silver-plated sheets of copper. At first, it requires several minutes of exposure in the camera, but later improvements reduce the exposure time to a few seconds. Photography suddenly enters the public consciousness and Daguerre's process is soon being used worldwide.
* 1839 – [[Henry Fox Talbot]] publicly introduces the paper-based process he worked out in 1835, calling it "photogenic drawing", but it requires much longer exposures than the daguerreotype and the results are not as clear and detailed.&lt;ref name="Schaaf1"/&gt;
* 1839 – [[Hippolyte Bayard]] presents the first public exhibition of photographs. He claims to have invented a photographic process prior to Daguerre and Talbot.
* 1839 – [[Sarah Anne Bright]] creates a series of [[photogram]]s, six of which are known to still exist. These are the earliest surviving photographic images created by a woman.
* 1839 – [[John Herschel]] introduces hyposulfite of soda (now known as [[sodium thiosulfate]] but still nicknamed "hypo") as a highly effective [[photographic fixer|fixer]] for all silver-based processes. He also makes the first glass negative.
* 1841 – [[Henry Fox Talbot]] introduces his patented [[calotype]] (or "talbotype") paper negative process, an improved version of his earlier process that greatly reduces the required exposure time.&lt;ref name="Schaaf1"/&gt;
* 1845 – [[Francis Ronalds]] invents the first successful camera for [[photography#Science and forensics|continuous recording]] of the variations in [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic]] parameters over time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=2016|title=The Beginnings of Continuous Scientific Recording using Photography: Sir Francis Ronalds’ Contribution|url=http://www.eshph.org/blog/2016/04/19/1642/|journal=European Society for the History of Photography|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613031339/http://www.eshph.org/blog/2016/04/19/1642/|archivedate=13 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1848 – [[A. E. Becquerel|Edmond Becquerel]] makes the first full-color photographs, but they are only laboratory curiosities: an exposure lasting hours or days is required and the colors are so light-sensitive that they sometimes fade right before the viewer's eyes while being examined.
* 1851 – Introduction of the [[collodion process]] by [[Frederick Scott Archer]], used for making [[photographic plate|glass negatives]], [[ambrotype]]s and [[tintype]]s.
* 1850s – [[Combination printing]] was introduced, probably first suggested by [[Hippolyte Bayard]] when he thought of using a separate negative of a properly exposed sky in combination with a proper negative of the landscape or monument documented for the [[Missions Héliographiques]] that started in 1851.
* 1854 – [[André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri]] credited with introduction of the ''[[carte de visite]]'' (English: ''visiting card'' or ''calling card'') format for [[portrait photography|portraiture]]. Disdéri uses a camera with multiple lenses that can photograph eight different poses on one large negative. After printing on albumen paper, the images are cut apart and glued to calling-card-size mounts.
* 1861 – [[James Clerk Maxwell]] presents a projected [[additive color]] image of a multicolored ribbon, the first demonstration of color photography by the three-color method he suggested in 1855. It uses three separate black-and-white photographs taken and projected through red, green and blue color [[filter (optics)|filters]]. The projected image is temporary but the set of three "color separations" is the first durable color photograph.
* 1868 – [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]] patents his numerous ideas for color photography based on the three-color principle, including procedures for making [[subtractive color]] prints on paper. They are published the following year. Their implementation is not technologically practical at that time, but they anticipate most of the color processes that are later introduced.
* 1871 – The [[Photographic film|gelatin emulsion]] is invented by [[Richard Maddox]].
* 1873 – [[Hermann Wilhelm Vogel]] discovers dye sensitization, allowing the blue-sensitive but otherwise color-blind photographic [[photographic emulsion|emulsions]] then in use to be made sensitive to green, yellow and red light. Technical problems delay the first use of dye sensitization in a commercial product until the mid-1880s; fully [[panchromatic]] emulsions are not in common use until the mid-20th century.
* 1876 – [[Ferdinand Hurter|Hurter]] &amp; [[Vero Charles Driffield|Driffield]] begin systematic evaluation of sensitivity characteristics of photographic emulsions — the science of [[sensitometry]].
* 1878 – Heat ripening of gelatin emulsions is discovered. This greatly increases sensitivity and makes possible very short "snapshot" exposures.
* 1878 – [[Eadweard Muybridge]] uses a row of cameras with trip-wires to make a high-speed photographic analysis of a galloping horse. Each picture is taken in less than the two-thousandth part of a second, and they are taken in sufficiently rapid sequence (about 25 per second) that they constitute a brief real-time "movie" that can be viewed by using a device such as a [[zoetrope]], a photographic "first".
* 1887 – [[Celluloid]] [[film base]] introduced.
* 1888 – The [[Kodak]] n°1 box camera, the first easy-to-use camera, is introduced with the slogan, "You press the button, we do the rest."
* 1888 – [[Louis Le Prince]] makes [[Roundhay Garden Scene]]. It is believed to be the first-ever motion picture on film.
* 1889 – The first commercially available transparent celluloid roll film is introduced by the Eastman Company,&lt;ref name=KodakMP/&gt; later renamed the [[Eastman Kodak]] Company and commonly known as Kodak.
* 1891 – [[Gabriel Lippmann]] announces a "method of reproducing colors photographically based on the phenomenon of interference".
* 1891 – [[William Kennedy Laurie Dickson]] develops the "[[kinetoscope|kinetoscopic]]" motion picture camera while working for [[Thomas Edison]].
* 1895 – [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] invent the [[cinématographe]].
* 1898 – Kodak introduces the [[folding camera|Folding]] Pocket Kodak.
* 1900 – Kodak introduces their first Brownie, a very inexpensive user-reloadable point-and-shoot box camera.

===20th century onwards===
* 1901 – Kodak introduces the [[120 film]] format.
* 1902 – [[Arthur Korn]] devises practical [[telephotography]] technology (reduction of photographic images to signals that can be transmitted by wire to other locations).''Wire-Photos'' are in wide use in Europe by 1910, and transmitted to other continents by 1922.
* 1907 – The [[Autochrome Lumière|Autochrome]] plate is introduced. It becomes the first commercially successful color photography product.
* 1908 – [[Kinemacolor]], a two-color process known as the first commercial "natural color" system for movies, is introduced.
* 1909&lt;!--Kodak's mainline chronology says they "produced" the first "commercially practical" safety film in 1908, their motion picture film chronology says they "announced" it in 1909 and that it was first "offered for sale in 22mm" (the oddball Edison show-at-home format) in 1910--&gt; – Kodak announces a 35&amp;nbsp;mm "safety" motion picture film on an acetate [[film base|base]] as an alternative to the highly flammable nitrate base.&lt;ref name=KodakMP&gt;[http://motion.kodak.com/motion/About/Chronology_Of_Film/index.htm Kodak Chronology of Motion Picture Films 1889 to 1939] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6JGa40cjq?url=http://motion.kodak.com/motion/About/Chronology_Of_Film/index.htm |date=2013-08-30 }}. Retrieved 2 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The motion picture industry discontinues its use after 1911 due to technical imperfections.
* 1912 – Vest Pocket Kodak using [[127 film]].
* 1912 – [[Thomas Edison]] introduces a short-lived 22&amp;nbsp;mm home motion picture format using acetate "safety" film manufactured by Kodak.&lt;ref name=KodakMP/&gt;
* 1913 – Kodak makes 35&amp;nbsp;mm [[panchromatic film|panchromatic]] motion picture film available on a bulk special order basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">'''Tomás Ó Con Cheanainn''' (1921 – 13 June 2015) was an Irish scholar and historian.

A native of Baile an tSagairt, Cois Fhairrge, County Galway, Ó Con Cheanainn won a scholarship in 1940 to [[University College Galway]], studying for a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Irish and Classics. His MA thesis concerned a hagiographical text in the [[Leabhar Breac]] - the early 15th-century codex was later a subject of "a major palaeographical study, which marked the commencement of a virtual reinvention, wrought single-handedly in his lifetime, of scholarly knowledge concerning the culture and traditions of Connacht."

According to his obit in [[The Irish Times]]:

"Tomás had an unrivalled knowledge of the literary and historical content of Irish manuscripts, medieval and modern. But he was also a palaeographical “natural”, possessed of a wonderfully keen eye for the salient features of a scribal hand. Long before digital imagery and databases, he showed a capacity to recall and associate such features in manuscripts from different collections, and to fix an identity previously unrecognised. He mastered the art of describing styles of handwriting with clarity and exactness, regardless of whether he was writing in English or, as he did almost exclusively in later years, in Irish."

Ó Con Cheanainn held the chair of Classical Irish at [[University College Dublin]] until his retirement in 1986. From 1975 to 1986 he edited [[Éigse: A Journal of Irish Studies]], and was a member of the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. The last of his many articles, written when age 90, concerned his dynastic ancestors, the [[Uí Díarmata]] and the process by which its ruling sept adopted the surname Ua Con Cheanainn.

'''William Canniff''', (born in [[Thurlow]], [[Upper Canada]], 20 June 1830; died in [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]], [[Ontario]] 18 October 1910) was a [[surgeon]], [[public health]] pioneer, historian and advocate of [[Canadian nationalism]].&lt;ref name=macdougall&gt;{{cite web|last=MacDougall|first=H|title=William Caniff|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/william-canniff|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=macdougall1994&gt;{{cite web|last=MacDougall|first=H.|title=William Caniff|url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=6606&amp;interval=20&amp;&amp;PHPSESSID=vzofxpjx|work=Dictionary of Canadian Biography, Vol. 13|publisher=University of Toronto/Université Laval|accessdate=16 September 2013|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Dr. William Canniff trained in medicine in Canada, the US, Great Britain and Europe prior to settling in Belleville where he practiced surgery. In 1852 he enrolled at the Victoria College Medical School studying under [[Dr. William Thomas Aikins]].&lt;ref name="macdougall1994"/&gt; Following brief periods of study and practice in New York, London, Edinburgh, Dublin, and Paris, Canniff returned to Belleville, Ontario, joining the faculty of the Victoria School in 1859 as a lecturer in pathology. Canniff was rapidly promoted to Professor of Surgery, however, he resigned his position in 1863 following a conflict with his colleague, [[John Rolph (professor)|John Rolph]].&lt;ref name="macdougall1994"/&gt; Canniff returned to the Victoria School in 1868 and remained there until its closure in 1874. During his brief departure from Victoria College, Canniff authored the first Canadian textbook on pathology, ''A manual of the principles of surgery: based on pathology for students'', Philadelphia: Lindsay &amp; Blakiston, 1866.&lt;ref name="macdougall"/&gt; Canniff became a founding member of the [[Canadian Medical Association]] in 1867 and the [[Ontario Medical Association]] in 1880.

==Toronto's Medical Officer of Health==
In 1883, Canniff became Toronto's first permanent Medical Officer of Health.&lt;ref name=tph_intro&gt;{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Introduction|url=http://www.toronto.ca/archives/public-health/index.htm|work=An infectious idea: 125 years of public health in Toronto|publisher=Toronto Public Health: Toronto, Ontario, Canada|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his role as MOH, Canniff appreciated the role of water in disease transmission, and advocated hygienic waste-water disposal and a centralized drinking water supply for the city.&lt;ref name=tph_water_and_sewage&gt;{{cite web|last=Anonymous|title=Clean water and sewage treatment|url=http://www.toronto.ca/archives/public-health/water.htm|work=An infectious idea: 125 years of public health in Toronto|publisher=Toronto Public Health: Toronto, Ontario, Canada|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his tenure as chief medical officer for Toronto, Canniff met resistance from physicians who defied his department's requirement for infectious disease reporting, arguing that the extra effort needed to do this went uncompensated.&lt;ref name=bator1979/&gt;{{rp|36}} At the same time, city council continued to pressure Canniff for his failure to collect comprehensive disease surveillance statistics, criticizing his lack of impact on the growing spread of infectious illnesses. Both factors fed Canniff's frustration, ultimately leading to his resignation from the department in 1890.&lt;ref name=bator1979/&gt;{{rp|36}} After Canniff's departure, the position remained unfilled for two years until the hiring of Dr. Norman Allen.&lt;ref name=bator1979/&gt;{{rp|37}}

==Other interests==
Canniff was a member of the [[Canada First]] movement whose membership promoted [[Canadian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="macdougall1994"/&gt; Canniff was also a noted  historian, authoring ''History Of The Settlement Of Upper Canada, Ontario: With Special Reference To The Bay Quinte, Toronto: Dudley &amp; Burns, Toronto, 1869; Mason; ''History Of The Province Of Ontario (Upper Canada)'', Toronto: A.H. Hovey, 1872; and ''The Medical Profession in Upper Canada 1783-1850'', Toronto: William Briggs, 1894.

The '''World Trade Center Health Program''' (WTC Health Program) provides medical benefits to specific groups of individuals affected by the [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]] on the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=wtchp-site&gt;{{cite web|title=World Trade Center Health Program|url=https://www.cdc.gov/wtc/|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTC Health Program was established by Title I of the [[James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act]] (Zadroga Act), P.L. 111-347, which amended the [[Public Health Service Act]]. The [[United States Congress]] passed the bill in December 2010 and [[United States President]] [[Barack Obama]] signed it into law on January 2, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docket/archive/pdfs/NIOSH-226/0226-010510-act.pdf|title=James L.

On December 18, 2015, the Zadroga Act was reauthorized to provide medical benefits to affected individuals until 2090.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Text from House Omnibus bill|url = https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2029/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22zadroga%22%5D%7D&amp;resultIndex=3#toc-HCE4485C66D7944D8A3DA7319213CD33E|website = |access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]], within the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], administers the program. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is component of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).

The [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] towers on September 11, 2001 (9/11) caused physical hazards as well as massive [[dust cloud]], consisting of pulverized building materials, electronic equipment, and furniture to blanket the [[World Trade Center site]] and the surrounding area. Many 9/11 responders, local workers, and resident survivors have since developed respiratory diseases, digestive disorders, cancers, or mental health disorders as a result of these toxic exposures. The WTC Health Program provides screening and treatment for a specific list of 9/11-related conditions.

Residents, students, and office workers of [[Lower Manhattan]] and nearby [[Chinatown]] have also reported negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Updated Ground Zero Report Examines Failure of Government to Protect Citizens| publisher=Sierra Club| year=2006| url=http://www.sierraclub.org/groundzero/| accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several deaths have been linked to the toxic dust, and the victims' names have been included in the World Trade Center memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Smith| first=Stephen| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/28/national/main4049362.shtml| title=9/11 "Wall Of Heroes" To Include Sick Cops| publisher=CBS News| date=April 28, 2008| accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, the [[New York State Department of Health]] had documented at least 204 deaths of rescue and recovery workers since September 11, 2001. 77 of these individuals died of illnesses, including 55 from lung and various other cancers.  Kitty Gelberg, New York state Bureau of Occupational Health's chief epidemiologist said, "We're not saying they are all World Trade Center related; we're just saying this is what people are dying from."  Many of the 55 responders who died from cancer had cancer before September 11, 2001, but most of the cancer patients developed the disease afterward.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Susan Edelman, "Charting post-9/11 deaths", ''New York Post'', January 6, 2008, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Zadroga Act health programs ===

In 2002, following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, both the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[American Red Cross]] provided grants to launch the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) in response to individuals developing health issues related to the disaster. The [[United States Congress]] passed appropriations to provide limited health screening and treatment services to World Trade Center responders. The MMTP has received approximately $475 million from the federal government. Over 57,000 people met the program's initial eligibility requirements. On July 1, 2011, MMTP became a part of the World Trade Center Health Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41292.pdf Comparison of the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and the World Trade Center Health Program Created by Title I of P.L. 111-347, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Trade Center Environmental Health Center (EHC) was also established after the  9/11 terrorist attacks to treat WTC-related illnesses. This program consisted of three locations in and around New York City. On September 30, 2008, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) awarded the New York City [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation|Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC)]] a grant to be administered by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), to provide health services to non-responder populations in New York City affected by the World Trade Center terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2008/r080930.htm Press Release,  "CDC Awards $10 million to New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation to provide Health Services to Residents, Other Community Members Affected by 9/11 Attack,"  September 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the grant, HHC provided medical examinations, diagnostic testing, referral and treatment for residents, students, and others in the community that were directly affected by the dust and debris from the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehhcfoundation.org/MajorGrant.html HHC Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehhcfoundation.org/partners.html HHC Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the passage of the James Zadroga Act, the WTC EHC became part of the WTC Health Program.

In 2002 the [[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] and the [[New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene|New York City Health Department]] launched the World Trade Center Health Registry in collaboration with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. By tracking and investigating illnesses, the WTC Health Registry strives to monitor the health of people exposed to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTC Health Registry|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/wtc/html/registry/registry.shtml|work=9/11 Health|publisher=New York City Health Department|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WTC Health Registry continues to release annual reports on new findings regarding the health effects resulting from the terrorist attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WTC Health Registry 2011 Report|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/wtc/downloads/pdf/registry/wtchr-annual-report2011.pdf|publisher=World Trade Center Health Registry|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 14, 2006, then-[[Governor of New York]] [[George Pataki]] signed legislation to expand death benefits to Ground Zero workers who die from cancer or respiratory diseases, presumably from exposures to hazardous materials and toxins during recovery efforts. At the bill-signing ceremony, held at the World Trade Center site, Pataki mentioned [[James Zadroga]], a [[New York Police Department]] officer and 9/11 responder who had fallen ill following the terrorist attacks and died of lung disease in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Michael. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/15/nyregion/15benefits.html "Pataki Signs Law Increasing Death Benefits for Ground Zero Workers"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 15, 2006. Accessed September 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; James Zadroga would become the namesake of the federal bill that created the WTC Health Program in 2011.

{{Main|James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act}}
[[File:Obama signs Zadroga Act.jpg|thumb|300px|President Obama signing the James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 into law, January 2, 2011 at [[Plantation Estate]] in Hawaii.]]

Originally introduced in 2006 and eventually made law in 2011, the James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 funds and establishes a health program to provide medical treatment for responders and survivors who experienced or may experience health complications related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Senator [[Bob Menendez]] and Congresswoman [[Carolyn Maloney]] initially co-sponsored the bill, which failed to pass in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s109-3891 S. 3891 - 109th], James Zadroga Act of 2006 (GovTrack.us)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-6045 H.R. 6045 &amp;mdash; 109th], James Zadroga Act of 2006 (GovTrack.us)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Senate vote held on December 9, 2010, Democrats were unable to break a Republican [[filibuster]] against the bill.&lt;ref name="filibuster"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Hernandez| first = Raymond| title = Republicans Block U.S. Health Aid for 9/11 Workers| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]| pages = A28| date = December 10, 2010| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/nyregion/10health.html| accessdate = 2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With only 57 votes to end the Senate filibuster and an incoming influx of Republicans in the wake of the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 Congressional Elections]], the bill's future looked increasingly doubtful towards the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=time_stewart&gt;{{cite news|last=Newton-Small|first=Jay|title=Did Jon Stewart Turn the Tide on the 911 First Responders Bill?|url=http://swampland.time.com/2010/12/20/did-jon-stewart-turn-the-tide-on-the-911-first-responders-bill/|work=TIME Swampland|publisher=TIME Magazine|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
