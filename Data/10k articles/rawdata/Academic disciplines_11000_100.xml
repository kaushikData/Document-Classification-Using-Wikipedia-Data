'''Animal Research Institute Buildings''' is a heritage-listed set of [[research station]] buildings at 681 Fairfield Road, [[Yeerongpilly, Queensland|Yeerongpilly]], [[City of Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It is also known as Stock Experiment Station (1909-1932) and Animal Research Station (1932-1953). It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 13 June 2008.&lt;ref name=qhr&gt;{{cite QHR|22217|Animal Research Institute (former)|602598|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The former [[Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly|Animal Research Institute at Yeerongpilly]] was established by the [[Department of Agriculture and Stock (Queensland)|Department of Agriculture and Stock]] in 1909 as the Stock Experiment Station. The Station was the first purpose-built, farm-based facility of Australia's first Stock Institute and its work was primarily to research and control diseases in [[livestock]], develop [[vaccine]]s and improve animal health and production. The complex was extended over time to accommodate the changing needs of the Institute, the [[University of Queensland]]'s first veterinary training facility in 1938-1940 and then, between 1933 and 1967, the interrelated work of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt; In 1889 an Intercolonial Stock Conference in [[Melbourne]] recommended that an Australasian Stock Institute be established to study diseases in livestock; however the various colonies could not reach agreement on the matter. The first such institute was set up in Queensland in 1893 following a deputation of stock owners to the then Colonial Secretary, the Hon. [[Berkeley Basil Moreton]]. The [[Queensland Stock Institute]] was initially set up in rented premises in Turbot Street, [[Brisbane]], under [[bacteriologist]] [[Charles Joseph Pound]]. The premises included a laboratory and a museum.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:C. J. Pound pictured with his microscope.JPG|thumb|C. J. Pound at his microscope]]
Pound was a "[[microscopist]]" who trained in London in microscopy, [[physiology]] and bacteriology and at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]] in developing vaccines, then a new technology. Arriving in [[Sydney]] in 1892, he worked first for the [[Ministry of Health (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Health]] before taking up the position in Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

As part of his work for the new Stock Institute, in 1894 Pound proved that [[cattle tick]]s transmitted [[Redwater disease|Redwater Disease]] (Bacillary [[Hemoglobinuria]]), which was causing heavy losses in Queensland cattle. He conducted the first [[inoculation]] studies into this disease in Australia and established a methodology and dosage that are still used worldwide. He trained stockowners in the techniques of collecting recovered blood, [[Defibrillation|defibrillating]] it and using this vaccine to inoculate their stock. To facilitate this, he invented the "Pound" syringe and arranged for it to be manufactured. Backed by his lectures and published articles, this work made a major contribution to the success of Queensland's cattle industry. Pound's activities also included obtaining pathological specimens of various manifestations of diseases in stock and other domesticated animals, and items sent in by stock owners were added to the museum's collection. However, the primary object of the Institute in 1895 was to cultivate the pleuro-pneumonia virus for inoculating cattle. In 1897 administration of the Institute passed from the Colonial Secretary's Office to the Queensland Department of Agriculture, founded in 1887.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1899 new premises for the Institute were constructed in the then Brisbane suburb of Normanby (now within [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]). The two-storey red brick building, located next to the [[Brisbane Grammar School]] residence on College Road, included rooms for Mr Pound and clerical work; a general laboratory; plus chemistry, incubator, sterilizing and photographic rooms on the ground floor, and a museum, library and lecture room on the first floor. Outbuildings included two stalls and loose-boxes, plus other facilities for stock used in experiments.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Due to the government's increased focus on human health, Pound was transferred to the Health Section of the Home Secretary's Department as Government Bacteriologist and the department was renamed the Bacteriological Institute. He was the only scientist in Australia then producing [[tuberculin]], used in diagnosing human and bovine tuberculosis, and also carrying out work on [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:Sydney Dodd (1874-1926), veterinarian and scientist.jpg|thumb|Sydney Dodd (1874-1926), veterinarian and scientist]]
In 1907, due to concerns about the impact of [[cattle tick]] on the dairy industry, the Institute returned to the control of the Department of Agriculture and Stock and Dr Sydney Dodd was appointed Principal Veterinary Surgeon and Bacteriologist for three years. He continued research work on the eradication of cattle ticks and the diseases caused by them. At his suggestion, the Department acquired {{convert|23|ha}} of land at Yeerongpilly for an experimental station capable of accommodating the animals needed for research and sufficient for grass and crops to make the farm self-supporting in fodder. The Yeerongpilly site was more suitable than other sites considered as it was bounded on the north by the river, on the south by the railway line, leaving only narrow frontages on the east and west to adjoining land and public roads, thereby reducing the danger that disease could spread.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The first land sales in the Yeerongpilly area had begun in the 1850s and [[arrowroot]] and [[cotton]] were initially grown, being replaced by [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] before the industry moved north following a series of cold winters. In 1879, the [[Yeerongpilly Divisional Board]] was formed. The development of rail links in the 1880s opened the area to residential development; but this slowed in the late 19th century following the 1893 floods, which submerged much of Yeerongpilly; and the depression of the 1890s. In the early 20th century, development increased again and most of the area was connected to electricity by the 1920s.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Stock Experiment Station complex, designed by Dodd, opened in 1909 making Queensland the first state to possess such a facility. As well as Dodd, it employed two laboratory assistants and two farm workers. The offices and laboratories were housed in a timber building, the Stock Experiment Station Main Building, probably designed by [[Arthur Morry]], who was then the Department's architect. It had five rooms off a central corridor that led to a large, sixth room. There were verandahs on the eastern, northern and western sides. The rooms were all airy and well-lit, with fly-proof shields to windows and doors. The main laboratory in the room at the rear was fitted-out with shelves, cupboards and workbenches, much of which remains in 2011. There were also support structures and animal yards, along with a post mortem room, sheep and pig pens and an incinerator.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1909 a stable was erected to the north of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. The Department of Agriculture and Stock Annual Report for 1910 described the building:&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The stable provide four stalls, a loose-box, and feed-room, with a room for harness, tools, etc., and another room for small animals, specially ventilated. The manger fittings are of iron, with water-pots and hay-racks combined. The floors of stalls are laid with a special channelled stable brick, and a tramway is laid the whole length of the building with an overhead traveller for removing the carcasses of dead animals."&lt;/blockquote&gt;A similar building of 12 stalls, designated as cattle byres, was erected immediately to the north but it does not survive. The total cost of the complex to October 1909 was {{A£|5,000}}.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1910 Dodd resigned and Pound was transferred from the Bacteriological Institute, taking charge of the new Station until his retirement in 1932, when the facility was renamed the Animal Health Station and a large wing was added to the northern side of the main building to provide additional laboratories. This wing comprised three rooms accessed by a verandah on the western side, part of which was later in-filled. Some original benches and bookcases have been removed. A verandah annex accommodating toilet, store, shower and dressing room on the 1909 section was extended in 1940 to include a ladies dressing room and the whole was modified in 1958 for further laboratory space and updated staffroom and toilets.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Facilities for undertaking post mortems were an essential part of the work of the Stock Experiment Station. The first detached post mortem building was erected in the 1920s and by the early 1930s a new one was required. This building, the Animal Morgue, was erected in 1934 to designs prepared by [[Department of Public Works (Queensland)|Department of Public Works]] architect DFW Roberts. It comprised a single room with a purpose-built concrete mortuary table in the centre and two concrete dissecting benches against the northern wall. As much as possible of the building was constructed of concrete for ease of cleaning and hygiene. It was well ventilated with ceiling vents and a Robinson's Patent ventilator on the roof. The joins between walls and floor were coved. The windows and doors were timber and fly-screens were provided to all openings. Taps operated by foot remain at the dissecting bench in the north-eastern corner.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In the 1930s, staff carried out the first animal husbandry research studies in Queensland with nutritional experiments on pigs and poultry. Major alterations were undertaken in 1939 to convert the Animal Health Station for use as an anatomy school by the [[University of Queensland|University of Queensland's]] Veterinary School. In April 1935 [[Premier of Queensland|Queensland Premier]] [[William Forgan Smith]] had stated the reasoning behind the government's funding of a veterinary school for Queensland - that:&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Queensland ... was a primary producer, and its problems could in large measure be solved by research; veterinary science would supplement the contribution of agriculture ... a scientific veterinary staff would enable the Department of Agriculture and Stock to deal efficiently with all aspects of veterinary problems and only a Queensland school could meet Queensland's needs ..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[The Courier (Brisbane)|The Courier]] Mail concurred:&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"animal husbandry, sheep, beef and dairy cattle supported the whole edifice of the state's economy. The need was clear ..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Subsequently, in 1936, a faculty of Veterinary Science had been established within the University of Queensland to provide local training for veterinarians. For practical and economic reasons the faculty used the existing facilities at the Animal Health Station at Yeerongpilly and the [[North Queensland]] Stock Experiment Station at [[Oonoonba, Queensland|Oonoonba]] in [[Townsville]] (est. 1915), as it was thought that their work would complement that of the Veterinary Science Department.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A dedicated building for the School was planned for the Yeerongpilly site and its first stage - comprising part of the animal hospital and the northern wing of the main building - was completed in 1938. Facilities for anatomy were still required so the 1909 stable was altered for this purpose by infilling the door openings on the north with weatherboards and casement windows, lining interior walls with VJ pine boards, inserting a ceiling and covering the brick floor with a concrete slab. (It is not clear if all brick floors were simply covered or some removed. Some channeled brick flooring remains in the room on the south-eastern corner of the stable in 2011.) In {{circa|1940}} a [[Skillion roof|skillion-roofed]], weatherboard-clad annex was erected along the stable's eastern side.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The final two stages in the building of the Veterinary School were completed by 1940 commencing with the remainder of the Hospital Block and the southern wing, and ending with the eastern (entry) wing. It contained five laboratories, offices, library, dark room, stores, toilets, locker and common rooms; the northern wing offices, lecture rooms, X-ray room and operating theatres; and the southern wing a museum, preparation room, post-mortem room and common room. The Hospital Block was L-shaped forming a courtyard at the rear of Main Building. It provided accommodation for cattle, horses, dogs, cats, and small animals receiving treatment. A two-storey fodder store was located on the south-western corner of the Hospital Block and a blacksmith shop on the eastern end of its southern wing. The construction of the Veterinary School was completed for {{A£|26,000}}.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School suspended its activities during [[World War II]]. The [[United States Army|United States Army's]] 3rd Medical Laboratory arrived in Brisbane in June 1942, and its Headquarters Section moved into the new Veterinary School buildings soon after. The functions of a Medical Laboratory (on behalf of US Army medical units) included: water analyses; examination of food supplies; investigation of [[epidemic]]s and [[epizootic]]s; and the distribution of special laboratory supplies. The laboratories performed special [[Serology|serological]], bacteriological, [[pathological]] and chemical examinations, and would have played an important role in safeguarding the health of US troops operating in a tropical environment.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Medical Laboratories could also furnish support for [[post mortem]] examinations. The USA Quartermaster had a [[morgue]] in Yeerongpilly by October 1943, and this was probably the morgue at the School. US military personnel who died in Australia were buried locally, including at [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]], and their bodies were returned to the USA after the war.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The 3rd Medical Laboratory was the only laboratory in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific Area]] until mid 1943, and it also functioned as a [[Malaria]] School. Apparently it did not treat any patients. A Veterinary Officer also served at the Headquarters section, to supervise the animal section of the laboratory. In August 1943 the 3rd Medical Laboratory was replaced at Yeerongpilly by the 8th Medical Laboratory, which left Australia in late August 1944. The circular garden arrangement with flagpole located in front of the Veterinary School is a typical US Army design, and probably dates from the period of US occupation. The Veterinary School was handed back to the government in excellent order, with some improvements, in September 1944. After the departure of the US Army, staff from the Stock Experiment Station Main Building moved into the Veterinary School Main Building. In 1946-7 the university moved into relocated timber buildings on site. The University of Queensland's Veterinary School remained there in temporary accommodation until February 1961 when the school moved to the university's [[St Lucia, Queensland|St Lucia]] campus.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Dr FHS Roberts, Parasitologist, Yeerongpilly Animal Health Station, May 1937.jpeg|thumb|Dr FHS Roberts, Parasitologist, 1937]]
By the early 1930s, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR, later CSIRO, established in 1926 by the Australian Government) were conducting research on stock in Queensland, collaborating with and complementing the work of the Department of Agriculture and Stock. This interaction saw responsibilities for certain aspects of pest control and research shift between the organizations. Over time a number of scientists involved in animal research worked for both organizations. Among these scientists, one who had a longstanding and important association with Yeerongpilly was Dr Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts (1901-1972). Born in [[Rockhampton]], Roberts studied at the University of Queensland and was based at Yeerongpilly from 1933 as an [[Entomology|entomologist]] and [[Parasitology|parasitologist]]. Roberts specialized in researching parasitic diseases of livestock and was sent abroad for this purpose, and additionally researched domestic animal parasites.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

From 1945, CSIR were using the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. In 1947 Roberts was appointed as principal research officer and officer-in charge of the new CSIR Veterinary Parasitology Laboratory at Yeerongpilly. The CSIR announced in early 1948 that in tandem with beef production expansion, Queensland would become the Australian centre for research into the industry. In June of that year the Department of Agriculture and Stock announced that the CSIR would be granted for ten years, "free of interest" the buildings at the State Animal Health laboratory.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Cairns Post|Cairns Post]], 15 June 1948, p3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, CSIR was renamed CSIRO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. A timber wing was added on the southern side of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building in 1950 to provide additional facilities for CSIRO's Veterinary Parasitology Laboratory. Under the leadership of Roberts, this laboratory became known internationally for its work on parasitic diseases of cattle. A number of other subsidiary buildings were also erected on the site during this period to accommodate the work of CSIRO.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1954, the Animal Health Station was renamed the Animal Research Institute and from 1967 Queensland Government laboratory staff were again housed in the Stock Experiment Station Main Building, following CSIRO's departure for new laboratories at Long Pocket, [[Indooroopilly, Queensland|Indooroopilly]].&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1952 about {{convert|21|acre}} of the site was transferred to the [[Brisbane City Council]] and then on to the State Electricity Authority for the development of the [[Tennyson Power Station]], which has since been demolished to make way for riverside apartment blocks and a tennis centre.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

There are several buildings on site that are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. In 1956 three buildings were erected at the rear of western wing of the Veterinary School Hospital Block - two brick buildings accommodating animal stalls and a metal-clad and framed building for stores. The c.1938 garage adjacent to the northern end of the hospital was also extended as part of these additions. In 1960 a brick staff amenities building was erected adjacent to the stores building and abutting the western wall of the Hospital Block. These buildings demonstrate the expansion of the Animal Research Institute in the 1950s and early 1960s but are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Several timber buildings erected in the early 1950s to provide additional offices and laboratory accommodation are located immediately to the rear of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. These buildings are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Work carried out by the Institute over the years includes testing to diagnose diseases of cattle, sheep, goats, horses, deer, pigs and poultry. It is famous for its research into cattle tick fever and developing vaccines against stock diseases. Research work has been carried out on plant poisons, infectious and parasitic diseases, trace element deficiencies and metabolic disorders. Many diseases of livestock were first diagnosed and described at Yeerongpilly, leading to effective control measures being developed. The research undertaken by the Institute has been a major factor in the development of pastoral primary industries in Queensland.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Following road works in 1983 the main entrance to the Institute was relocated from Fairfield Road to Ortive Street.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 1999 the Department of Primary Industries opened the CJ Pound Laboratory at the Tick Fever Research Centre at [[Wacol, Queensland|Wacol]], in honour of a man who was described by one newspaper as the "boffin" who "saved the cattle industry".&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 2011 the Institute has vacated the site which is to be redeveloped.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Animal Research Institute Yeerongpilly plan c 1983.svg|thumb|Site plan, circa 1983]]
The former Animal Research Institute is a complex of buildings, [[sheds]] and animal pens on a {{convert|12|ha}} site in the Brisbane suburb of Yeerongpilly. Those structures considered of state-level heritage significance are: the Stock Experiment Station Main Building (1909), an associated Stable (1909), the purpose-built Animal Morgue (1934), and the Veterinary School Main Building and Hospital Block (1938-1940). The entire Institute site is bound on the north by King Arthur Terrace, to the east by Fairfield Road, on the south by the [[Tennyson railway line|Tennyson Branch Railway line]], and to the west by an easement shared with the [[Queensland Tennis Centre]]. Its entrance is on King Arthur Terrace on the north-eastern corner and the significant buildings are clustered on higher ground across the eastern half of the site with the remaining, lower area comprising many large, fenced yards of grass.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Stock Experiment Station Main Building ===
The Stock Experiment Station Main Building is a large timber-framed building comprising a central rectangular core with wings to the north (1932) and south (1950). All the building's phases feature verandahs, some of which are enclosed. The building is low-set and single-storey except for the southern wing which, in using the slope of the land, is two-storey. The roof is hipped and sheeted with corrugated metal and has three metal ventilators on the centre ridge which are not original. This building occupies the centre of the site facing east onto a large asphalted forecourt used for car parking. The view this forecourt provides of what has historically been the front [[facade]] of the earliest building on the Institute site is considered of cultural heritage significance, while the asphalt itself is not.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The different phases of construction of this building are distinguishable in its fabric. The original 1909 core is in a Federation style, the northern wing (1932) has elements typical of the interwar classical style, and the southern wing (1950) is in a post-war functionalist style. The exterior of the building is clad with chamferboards on the core and southern wing and weatherboards on the northern wing. The core is surrounded by verandahs which are mostly enclosed. The southern and northern wings are long and narrow and have verandahs on their western sides providing access to the rooms that open from them.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The composition of the eastern facade reflects the symmetrical plan of the core. The open verandah has a small, projecting central gabled entrance with decorative timber battens and arches sheltering a short timber stair. A later timber ramp provides access to its southern end, which is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. Each verandah end is enclosed with glazing, weatherboards, and fibrous cement sheeting. The verandah balustrade is a timber post and rail arrangement that is not original and therefore not of cultural heritage significance. The verandah ceiling is tongue-and-groove jointed boarding on the rake and the floor is recent shot-edge boards.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The building's 1909 core comprises six rooms and a central hall leading off the east-facing front verandah to one of the rooms, a large laboratory, to the west. The hall has a decorative timber battened arch with moulded [[Bracket (architecture)|brackets]] and [[architrave]]. All rooms (except the laboratory) have pressed metal ceilings, pressed metal [[cornices]], and decorative, ventilated ceiling roses some of which have evidence of gas pendant lights which are not extant. The ceiling of the former laboratory is lined with flat sheeting with no [[cornice]]. The other rooms, formerly laboratories and store rooms, have plastered walls with rounded corners which are stop-chamfered near the ceiling. The hall walls are timber, vertically-jointed boards. There are no skirtings or rails throughout and all walls and ceilings are painted. The floors are lined with non-original carpet or vinyl, coverings which are not of cultural heritage significance.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The rooms feature a number of built-in timber cabinets, shelves, work benches, and freestanding furniture that are early or original. Original internal doors are timber with stop-chamfered detailing and have early or original brass (as well as more recent) [[door furniture]]. A number of recent doors have been installed throughout the 1909 core and are not of cultural heritage significance. Timber French doors with glazing and decorative [[bolection]] moulding and timber casement windows open onto the eastern verandah. Some of these doors and windows retain original glazed fanlights with curved brass opening stays and mechanisms with ceramic knobs. Projecting from the north- western corner of the rear, western verandah are a number of smaller rooms containing toilets and a shower, a staff room, and a small laboratory. The walls and ceilings of these rooms are lined with fibrous cement sheeting and rounded cover strips, and the floors are finished with vinyl, ceramic tiles, and terrazzo. The 1909 laboratory contains equipment, cupboards, and workbenches.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The core of the Station Main Building is supported on low concrete stumps, and timber and steel posts. There is a small, timber enclosure under the core on its southern side that contains a small laboratory with shelving, workbenches, and cupboards.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Station Main Building's northern wing comprises three rooms and a semi-enclosed, west-facing verandah. It is supported on low concrete stumps, and timber and steel posts. Tongue-and-groove jointed boarding lines the ceilings of each room and the floors are covered in vinyl or carpet. The walls of the central room are sheeted while the walls of the other two rooms have vertically-jointed boards with moulded belt rails. The rooms contain some solid timber furniture, wall-hung cupboards, and workbenches that appear original to the 1932 construction date. One original timber-boarded door remains in the southern-most room. The original windows are timber-framed and double- hung or casements with fanlights. Air conditioning units have replaced some windows however those remaining retain original brass hardware.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The southern wing comprises two levels, four rooms on the upper floor and three rooms and a toilets area on the lower, connected by a stair to west-facing verandahs. This building wing is founded on a concrete slab partially suspended and supported on brick-faced [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]]. The rooms have plasterboard ceilings with a large coved cornice, plasterboard walls, a square timber skirting, and vinyl covered floors. The rooms contain solid timber built-in workbenches and wall- hung cupboards that are original to the 1950 construction date. The rooms also feature a number of solid timber, freestanding pieces of furniture. The doors are timber with a glazed panel and some have screens. The original windows are timber-framed with two layers, an inner set of double hung sashes and an outer layer of casements. Those on the eastern side have timber brackets with slots for a workbench shield. The toilet ceilings and walls are sheeted, and the floor is a vinyl composite coved to the wall. The fixtures are original.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Adjacent to the western side of the Stock Experiment Station's northern wing is a small building, rectangular in plan with a Dutch [[gable]] roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting, weatherboard clad walls, and a concrete slab floor. The top section of the exterior walls is in-filled with mesh to the [[soffit]] allowing ventilation of the interior. A channel in the slab drains into a drainage trough running around the base of the south-western corner. A concrete ramp leads to a door on the side of the building and a large concrete open-topped tank is positioned next to the north-eastern side. The doors are timber, one having a screen. Some windows have been sheeted up to hold air conditioning units, while others are later aluminium-framed sliders.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Stable ===
The Stable (1909) is located nearby to the north of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building. It is a long rectangle in plan with a hipped and gabled roof. A small secondary gable extends about three- quarters the length of the main ridge to assist ventilation. All roof planes are sheeted with corrugated metal. The stable is timber-framed, and clad in weatherboards. The floor is a concrete slab with areas of early brick flooring visible in the rooms on its eastern side. The gable end walls have ventilated weatherboards at the apex. The interior is divided into a number of rooms by a combination of vertically-jointed boarding and sheet walls. The doors are all modern and not significant. The early windows are double-hung timber sashes. Some have had air conditioning units installed in the bottom sash. Channels in the floor connect to an external concrete spoon drain that runs around the base of the building. In the largest room, facing west, meshed ventilation windows are positioned near the floor. A freestanding building which is not significant is located on the eastern side of the stable separated by a very narrow space with a concrete spoon drain.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Animal Morgue ===
[[File:Animal Research Institute, Yeerongpilly - Animal Morgue, 2004.jpg|thumb|Animal morgue, 2004]]
The Animal Morgue (1934) is situated north of the Stable. The morgue is a cement-rendered concrete structure, square in plan, with a timber-framed pyramid roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A large metal ventilation fleche caps the ridge. A timber lean-to that is not significant shelters the entry doors. There are prominent stepped [[architraves]] around the exteriors of the windows. The interior walls are cement-rendered with coving to all corners. The floor is concrete, while the ceiling is white-painted cement sheet with dark- stained timber battens forming a geometric pattern. The ceiling features lattice timber ventilation panels and a skylight at the southern end made with translucent corrugated plastic sheeting. The double door is timber with multi-light glazed panels. The windows are multi-light, timber double-hung sashes and have external hinged timber-framed screens. There are small high level windows in the west wall. All glass in the building is obscured. A steel I-beam [[Span (architecture)|spans]] the width of the room from north to south. In the north-western corner is a concrete dissecting bench with drain and in the north-eastern corner is a similar bench with a ceramic sink and associated foot-operated tap. These tables drain to an integrated concrete surface gutter that runs around the western and northern edges of the floor. There is a central floor drain.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

=== Veterinary School Main Building ===
[[File:Vet School main building (2011).jpg|thumb|Vet School main building, 2011]]
The Veterinary School Main Building is located to the south-east of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building, facing east towards Fairfield Road. It is a large, single storey, U-shaped building of brick construction with a hipped roof clad with tiles. The building is notable for its Interwar Classical design and detailing, including its symmetrical plan form, high ceilings, interior colour scheme of white paint and dark-stained timber, and the rhythmic placement of its windows. The exterior of the building is glazed brick with cream- painted, cement-rendered dressings. The symmetrical front facade has a central pedimented entry and flanking wings with rhythmically placed windows terminating in projecting bays. The entry is prominent, having brick planters and metal [[pedestal]] lights with large globe-shaped shades. A metal [[awning]] shelters the door and is not significant.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

The entry foyer has a terrazzo floor, rendered walls scored to imitate stonework, moulded timber picture rail, decorative plaster cornice, and stained and clear lacquered timber doors with leaded glazing panels, [[sidelights]], and fanlights. A timber-framed reception window opens into the adjacent room. The room features timber, wall-hung display cabinet and pigeon holes, and a large amount of veterinary science paraphernalia.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The building plan is arranged around a central corridor that runs down all wings providing access to variously sized rooms on either side. The entry (eastern) wing contains laboratories, offices, toilets, and store rooms. The southern wing contains similar spaces and also a dark room and the post-mortem room. This is a large room, its floor set lower than the other rooms with coved concrete skirtings. It has a large doorway to the exterior in-filled with more recent glazing and a timber door, and a steel I-beam on the ceiling above the door. The northern wing again contains laboratories, offices and store rooms, but also a large lecture room with dais and kitchenette, and an equine operating theatre. Another large room, it has concrete floors, coved concrete skirtings, walls tiled to shoulder height, a steel I-beam and hoist trolley fixed to the ceiling above the large doorway to the exterior.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School building interior has sheeting and batten cover strips lining its ceilings in a geometric pattern. The ceiling ventilation panels have all been sheeted over. Walls are rendered, and floors are finished with carpet, vinyl, or sealed concrete coved to the walls. There are dark-stained and clear-finished timber skirtings, cornices, picture rails, and architraves in most rooms. Room names are painted on timber panels and fixed above doorways. The timber doors match the other timberwork in the building with circular, glass observation panels, or panels with bolection moulding. Most retain original brass hardware and some the original auto-closers. Windows are timber-framed double-hung sashes or timber-framed fixed panes; many of which have external, hinged, timber-framed screens and retain original brass hardware.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The building retains many original items of built-in and freestanding furniture including terrazzo-topped, cantilevered concrete work benches, solid timber cabinets, drawers, cupboards, ceramic pedestal basins, wall-hung timber display cases, and picture frames. The toilets retain original partitions and doors as well as many fixtures and fittings. Cupboards and store rooms retain original timber shelving.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The main facade of the building looks to the east and a grassed area where a large, circular garden bed formed by concrete edging is positioned. Its shape and extent are significant but not the edging. In its centre is a steel flagpole dating from the period of the School's occupation during WWII. The building wings facing to the west enclose a small [[courtyard]] which has large sections of concrete pathway and some plantings, none of which are significant.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

=== Veterinary School Hospital Block ===
[[File:Vet School Hospital Block (2011).jpg|thumb|Vet School Hospital Block, 2011]]
The Veterinary School Hospital Block is located to the west of the Veterinary School Main Building and its L-shaped plan completes a large grassed courtyard between the two. The hospital block is long and narrow with small stalls for animals along the western range, a two-level, brick fodder store in the south-western corner, a series of work rooms by the yard entrance on the north-west, further work rooms in the southern range terminating to the east with a blacksmith's room with forge and [[chimney]]. It combines glazed brickwork (the same as in the Veterinary School Main Building adjacent) and timber construction with a hipped roof over the fodder store and skillion roofs elsewhere; all clad with corrugated metal sheets. The interior walls of the animal stalls are painted brick with concrete floors. Enclosure on the yard side is by timber half-doors, steel mesh, and fly screens. Small, high-level windows feature on the rear wall. A timber and mesh enclosure runs along the front of the animal stalls and a concrete [[Apron (architecture)|apron]] with drain extends into the courtyard. The workrooms and blacksmith's room have timber double-hung sash windows and ceilings of jointed boarding. The forge is sheeted over internally. The upper level of the fodder store is accessed by a timber stair and door on its western facade, where a large timber beam and part of a pulley is fixed to the ceiling above the doorway. There is evidence of a trap door into the lower level. The three-bay garage on the northern end of the hospital block's western range of rooms opens to the north. Adjacent to this is a small reception office, gate, and store rooms that attach to the north-western end of the Veterinary School Main Building.&lt;ref name="qhr" /&gt;

Additions have been made to the western side of the Hospital Block and are not of heritage significance. Nor are the garages that were part of its original construction (1938–40).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
The Animal Research Institute Buildings were listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 13 June 2008 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.'''

The Animal Research Institute at Yeerongpilly was the oldest facility of its kind in Queensland, its work having begun with the establishment of the Stock Experiment Station in 1909 - the state's first purpose-built, farm-based animal research laboratory - and continued until its closure in 2010. The place demonstrates the enduring importance of the pastoral primary industries to Queensland's economy and the commitment of successive governments to supporting this industry through scientific research into its productivity, most particularly the diseases that threatened its profitability.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School Main Building and Hospital Block (1938-1940) were the first purpose-built facility for tertiary-level veterinary science training in Queensland. The buildings demonstrate the formalisation of professional training in the medical and veterinary sciences, and its physical association within professional facilities, an approach being strongly advocated by the state government at the time.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Over the course of its long history the Animal Research Institute (former) has accommodated the work of the state government's Animal Research Institute, the University of Queensland Veterinary School and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The place is associated with important scientific advances in diagnostic research into the prevention and treatment of diseases in livestock, and the development and supply of vaccines, to which all of these organisations have contributed.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The circular garden bed and flagpole at the front of the Veterinary School Main Building provide the only evidence of the occupation of it, and other parts of the site now demolished, by the United States Army during World War II. The 3rd Medical Laboratory, based there from 1942 until 1943 when the 8th Medical Laboratory took its place, played an important role in safeguarding the health of US troops operating in a tropical environment and was the only laboratory in the South West Pacific Area until mid 1943.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.'''

The Stock Experiment Station Main Building (1909), Stable (1909) and Animal Morgue (1934) are important as a demonstration of the principal characteristics of an animal research facility, comprising research laboratories, offices, animal accommodation and handling, and facility for conducting post mortems.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Veterinary School Main Building and Hospital Block (1938-1940) are important as a demonstration of the principal characteristics of Queensland's first veterinary school, including formally composed facades, offices, a lecture room, library, laboratories, animal operating and post-mortem rooms, animal stalls, fodder store and blacksmith.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Stock Experiment Station Main Building, Animal Morgue, Veterinary School Main Building, and Hospital Block are substantially intact and retain original interior and exterior detailing to facilitate superior functionality, as well as built-in and loose furniture, fixtures, and fittings used specifically for performing animal research, all of which provide a clear demonstration of the original function of the place.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

'''The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.'''

The core of the Stock Experiment Station Main Building and the Stable, the earliest parts of the former Animal Research Institute, have a special association with Charles Joseph Pound (b. 1866, d. 1946), the inaugural director of the Queensland Stock Institute, the first such laboratory in Australia, and head of the facility at Yeerongpilly from 1910 to 1932 when he retired. Pound is credited with the research and development that provided a means of preventing the spread of Redwater Disease, which caused heavy losses to Queensland's vital cattle industry during the late nineteenth century. Under the auspices of the Institute Pound conducted the first inoculation studies into this disease in Australia and established a methodology and dosage that are still used worldwide.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The former Animal Research Institute also has a special association with the internationally renowned parasitologist and entomologist Dr Frederick Hugh Sherston Roberts (b. 1901, d. 1972) who began work at the Yeerongpilly research facility in 1933 when it was known as the Animal Health Station. Following World War II, he returned to work at Yeerongpilly and under his direction as principal research officer and officer-in-charge of CSIRO's veterinary parasitology laboratory (1947-1966) the Yeerongpilly institute gained an international reputation for its studies of parasitic diseases in cattle.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The bodies of these [[annelids]] are externally marked by annuli that are arranged in series with each other. 

An annulus may also be an indication of growth in certain species, similar to [[dendrochronology]].  For example, in fish, it is a series of concentric rings (or [[:wikt:annulus|annuli]]) formed in the scales of bony fish.&lt;ref name="fish"&gt;{{cite web|last=Allaby|first=Michael|title=Dictionary definition of annulus|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O8-annulus.html|work=encyclopedia.com|accessdate=11 July 2010|year=1999|quote=annulus: One of a series of concentric rings or bands of varying width and opacity which are formed in the scales of bony fish. Winter rings are often narrower and denser than summer rings. The number of annuli is indicative of the age of a fish.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In bivalve mollusks, annuli are concentric growth rings in their shells.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3339">[[File:Aristarchus of Samothrace.JPG|thumb|Aristarchus of Samothrace, detail from: ''Apotheosis of Homer'' (1827) by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] (1780–1867)]]
'''Aristarchus of Samothrace''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀρίσταρχος ὁ Σαμόθραξ}}; c. 220 &amp;ndash; c. 143 BC) was a [[Philologist|grammarian]] noted as the most influential of all scholars of [[Homer]]ic poetry. He was the [[librarian]] of the [[Library of Alexandria|library]] [[Alexandria|of Alexandria]] and seems to have succeeded his teacher [[Aristophanes of Byzantium|Aristophanes]] [[Byzantium|of Byzantium]] in that role.

He left Samothrace island at a young age and went to [[Alexandria]]  where he studied with the director of the [[Library of Alexandria|library]]. Later at first he was a teacher at the Royal courtyard and then director of the library from 153 to 145 BC. After he was persecuted by his disciple Ptolemy the Benefactor, he found refuge in [[Cyprus]] where he died. 

It said that Aristarchus had a remarkable memory and was completely indifferent as to his external appearance.

He established the most historically important critical edition of the Homeric poems, and he is said to have applied his teacher's accent system to it, pointing the texts with a careful eye for metrical correctness. His rejection of doubtful lines&lt;ref&gt;Cic. ad Fam. iii.11.5, ix.10.1; in Pis. 30.73&lt;/ref&gt; made his severity proverbial.&lt;ref&gt;Hor. A. P. 450&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that he, or more probably, another predecessor at Alexandria, [[Zenodotus]], was responsible for the division of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' into twenty-four books each. According to the ''[[Suda]]'', Aristarchus wrote 800 treatises ({{lang|grc|ὑπομνήματα}}) on various topics; these are all lost but for fragments preserved in the various ''[[scholia]].'' His works cover such writers as Alcaeus, Anacreon, Pindar, Hesiod, and the tragedians.

Accounts of his death vary, though they agree that it was during the persecutions of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt|of Egypt]]. One account has him, having contracted an incurable [[Edema|dropsy]], starving himself to death while in exile on [[Cyprus]].

He modified the system of the ancient Greek textual signs (''semeia'') and from some point on these signs were called [[Aristarchian symbols]]. The historical connection of his name to [[literary criticism]] has created the term '''''aristarch''''' for someone who is a judgmental critic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20469">'''Bioinorganic chemistry''' is a field that examines the role of [[metal]]s in [[biology]]. Bioinorganic chemistry includes the study of both natural phenomena such as the behavior of [[metalloprotein]]s as well as artificially introduced metals, including those that are [[essential element|non-essential]], in [[medicine]] and [[toxicology]].  Many [[biological process]]es such as [[cellular respiration|respiration]] depend upon molecules that fall within the realm of [[inorganic chemistry]].   The discipline also includes the study of inorganic models or mimics that imitate the behaviour of metalloproteins.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Lippard, Jeremy M. Berg, ''Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry'', University Science Books, 1994, {{ISBN|0-935702-72-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a mix of [[biochemistry]] and [[inorganic chemistry]], bioinorganic chemistry is important in elucidating the implications of electron-transfer [[protein]]s, substrate bindings and activation, atom and group transfer chemistry as well as metal properties in biological chemistry.

==Composition of living organisms==
About 99% of [[mammals]]' mass are the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], [[potassium]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[oxygen]] and [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name=Heymsfield&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heymsfield S, Waki M, Kehayias J, Lichtman S, Dilmanian F, Kamen Y, Wang J, Pierson R |title=Chemical and elemental analysis of humans in vivo using improved body composition models |journal=[[American Journal of Physiology]] |volume=261 |issue=2 Pt 1 |pages=E190–8 |year=1991 |pmid=1872381}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organic compound]]s ([[proteins]], [[lipids]] and [[carbohydrates]]) contain the majority of the carbon and nitrogen and most of the oxygen and hydrogen is present as water.&lt;ref name=Heymsfield/&gt;  The entire collection of metal-containing [[biomolecules]] in a [[Cell (biology)|cell]] is called the [[metallome]].

==History==
[[Paul Ehrlich]] used [[organoarsenic]] (“arsenicals”) for the treatment of [[syphilis]], demonstrating the relevance of metals, or at least metalloids, to medicine, that blossomed with Rosenberg’s discovery of the anti-cancer activity of [[cisplatin]] (cis-PtCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).  The first protein ever crystallized (see [[James B. Sumner]]) was [[urease]], later shown to contain nickel at its [[active site]].  [[Cyanocobalamin|Vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], the cure for [[pernicious anemia]] was shown crystallographically by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] to consist of a cobalt in a [[corrin]] macrocycle.  The Watson-Crick structure for [[DNA]] demonstrated the key structural role played by phosphate-containing polymers.

==Themes in bioinorganic chemistry==
Several distinct systems are of identifiable in bioinorganic chemistry.  Major areas include:

===Metal ion transport and storage===
This topic covers a diverse collection of [[ion channel]]s, ion pumps (e.g. [[NaKATPase]]), [[vacuole]]s, [[siderophore]]s, and other [[protein]]s and small molecules which control the concentration of metal ions in the cells.  One issue is that many metals that are metabolically required are not readily available owing to solubility or scarcity.  Organisms have developed a number of strategies for collecting such elements and transporting them.

===Enzymology===
Many reactions in life sciences involve water and metal ions are often at the catalytic centers (active sites) for these enzymes, i.e. these are [[metalloprotein]]s.  Often the reacting water is a ligand (see [[metal aquo complex]]).  Examples of [[hydrolase]] enzymes are [[carbonic anhydrase]], metallo[[phosphatase]]s, and [[metalloproteinase]]s.  Bioinorganic chemists seek to understand and replicate the function of these metalloproteins.

Metal-containing electron transfer proteins are also common.  They can be organized into three major classes: [[iron-sulfur protein]]s (such as [[rubredoxin]]s, [[ferredoxin]]s, and [[Rieske protein]]s), blue [[copper proteins]], and [[cytochrome]]s. These electron transport proteins are complementary to the non-metal electron transporters [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide]] (NAD) and [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]] (FAD). The [[nitrogen cycle]] make extensive use of metals for the redox interconversions.
[[Image:FdRedox.png|center|500px|thumb|4Fe-4S clusters serve as electron-relays in proteins.]]

===Toxicity===
Several metal ions are toxic to humans and other animals. The bioinorganic chemistry of lead in the context of its toxicity has been reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Maret |first1= Wolfgang|chapter= Chapter 1.

{{Main article|Transition metal dioxygen complex}}
Aerobic life make extensive use of metals such as iron, copper, and manganese.  [[Heme]] is utilized by [[red blood cell]]s in the form of [[hemoglobin]] for oxygen transport and is perhaps the most recognized metal system in biology.  Other oxygen transport systems include [[myoglobin]], [[hemocyanin]], and [[hemerythrin]].  [[Oxidase]]s and [[oxygenase]]s are metal systems found throughout nature that take advantage of oxygen to carry out important reactions such as energy generation in [[cytochrome c oxidase]] or small molecule oxidation in [[cytochrome P450 oxidase]]s or [[methane monooxygenase]].  Some metalloproteins are designed to protect a biological system from the potentially harmful effects of oxygen and other reactive oxygen-containing molecules such as [[hydrogen peroxide]].  These systems include [[peroxidase]]s, [[catalase]]s, and [[superoxide dismutase]]s.  A complementary metalloprotein to those that react with oxygen is the [[oxygen evolving complex]] present in plants.  This system is part of the complex protein machinery that [[Oxygen evolution|produces oxygen]] as plants perform [[photosynthesis]].

===Bioorganometallic chemistry===
[[Bioorganometallic chemistry|Bioorganometallic]] systems feature metal-carbon bonds as structural elements or as intermediates. Bioorganometallic enzymes and proteins include the [[hydrogenase]]s, [[FeMoco]] in nitrogenase, and [[methylcobalamin]].  These naturally occurring [[organometallic compounds]].  This area is more focused on the utilization of metals by unicellular organisms. Bioorganometallic compounds are significant in [[environmental chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Sigel |editor-first=A. |editor2=Sigel, H. |editor3=Sigel, R.K.O. |title=Organometallics in Environment and Toxicology|publisher=RSC publishing|location=Cambridge|year=2010|series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences|volume=7|isbn=978-1-84755-177-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metals in medicine===
{{Main article|Metals in medicine}}
A number of drugs contain metals.  This theme relies on the study of the design and mechanism of action of metal-containing pharmaceuticals, and compounds that interact with endogenous metal ions in enzyme active sites. The most widely used anti-cancer drug is [[cisplatin]].  [[MRI contrast agent]] commonly contain [[gadolinium]].  [[Lithium carbonate]] has been used to treat the manic phase of bipolar disorder.  Gold antiarthritic drugs, e.g. [[auranofin]] have been commerciallized.  [[Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]] are metal complexes have been developed to suppress inflammation by releasing small amounts of carbon monoxide.  The [[cardiovascular]] and [[neuron]]al importance of [[nitric oxide]] has been examined, including the enzyme [[nitric oxide synthase]]. (See also: [[nitrogen assimilation]].) Besides, metallic transition complexes based on triazolopyrimidines have been tested against several parasite strains. &lt;ref name="pmid29227923"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Méndez-Arriaga JM, Oyarzabal I, etal |title=In vitro leishmanicidal and trypanocidal evaluation and magnetic properties of 7-amino-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine Cu(II) complexes |journal=J.

===Environmental chemistry===
{{main article|Environmental chemistry}}
Environmental chemistry traditionally emphasizes the interaction of heavy metals with organisms.  [[Methylmercury]] has caused major disaster called [[Minamata disease]]. [[Arsenic poisoning]] is a widespread problem owing largely to [[arsenic contamination of groundwater]], which affects many millions of people in developing countries.  The metabolism of mercury- and arsenic-containing compounds involves [[cobalamin]]-based enzymes.

===Biomineralization===

==Types of inorganic elements in biology==

===Alkali and alkaline earth metals===

The abundant inorganic elements act as [[ion]]ic [[electrolyte]]s. The most important ions are [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[chloride]], [[phosphate]], and [[bicarbonate]].

===Main group compounds===
Many other elements aside from metals are bio-active.  Sulfur and phosphorus are required for all life.   Phosphorus almost exclusively exists as phosphate and its various [[ester]]s.  Sulfur exists in a variety of oxidation states, ranging from sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) down to sulfide (S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).  Selenium is a trace element involved in proteins that are antioxidants. Cadmium is important because of its toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1819">'''Buckling-restrained braced frame''' (BRBF) is a structural [[steel frame]] that provides lateral resistance to [[buckling]], particularly during [[seismic activity]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry A. Fahnestock, James M. Ricles, and Richard Sause, ''Experimental Evaluation of a Large-Scale Buckling-Restrained Braced Frame'', J. Struct. Eng. 133, 1205 (2007); {{doi|10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2007)133:9(1205)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BRBF is typically a special case of a [[Braced Frame|concentrically braced frame]]. Tests have demonstrated BRBF systems are highly effective for energy dissipation, while being vulnerable to large deformations and story drift.&lt;ref&gt;Kiggins S., Uang C.-M. ''Reducing residual drift of buckling-restrained braced frames as a dual system'' (2006) Engineering Structures, 28 (11), pp. 1525–1532.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[buckling-restrained brace]] (BRB) consists of a steel core surrounded by a [[Hollow structural section|hollow steel section]], coated with a low-friction material, and then grouted with a specialized [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]. The encasing and mortar prohibit the steel core from buckling when in compression, while the coating prevents axial load from being transferred to the encasement, thus preventing strength loss and allowing for better and more symmetric cyclic performance. These elements most commonly brace a bay diagonally or in a chevron pattern. Because maximum tension and compression forces in a BRB are much closer than in a standard brace, there is much less imbalance of force in the chevron configuration resulting in smaller beam sizes than a standard braced frame.

[[image:Music-caesura.svg|thumb|100px|An example of a caesura in modern western music notation.]]
[[Image:Comma caesura.png|thumb|100px|Brief caesura used in choral works.]]
A '''caesura''' ({{IPAc-en|s|i|ˈ|zj|ʊər|ə}}, {{abbr|pl|plural}}. '''caesuras''' or '''caesurae'''; [[Latin]] for "cutting"), also written '''cæsura''' and '''cesura''', is a break in a verse where one phrase ends and the following phrase begins. It may be a '''comma''', a '''tick''', or two slashed lines '''//'''. In time value this break may vary between the slightest perception of silence all the way up to a full pause. Considered a [[breath]], a caesura in music represents a similar break or pause.&lt;ref&gt;Spreadbury, Daniel; Eastwood, Michael; Finn, Ben; and Finn, Jonathan (March 2008). "Sibelius 5 Reference", p.150. Edition 5.2. "The comma also indicates a short silence on instruments like the piano, which can't literally breath."&lt;/ref&gt; The length of a caesura where notated is at the discretion of the conductor. In choral works a brief caesura may be notated where singers are to catch their breath.

==Background==

In classical Greek and Latin poetry a caesura is the juncture where one word ends and the following word begins within a foot. In contrast, a word juncture at the end of a foot is called a [[Diaeresis (prosody)|diaeresis]]. Some caesurae are expected and represent a point of articulation between two phrases or clauses. All other caesurae are only potentially places of articulation. The opposite of an obligatory caesura is a bridge where word juncture is not permitted.

In modern European poetry, a caesura is defined as a natural phrase end, especially when occurring in the middle of a line. A {{nowrap|'''masculine caesura'''}} follows a [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] [[syllable]] while a {{nowrap|'''feminine caesura'''}} follows an unstressed syllable. A caesura is also described by its position in a line of poetry: a caesura close to the beginning of a line is called an ''initial'' caesura, one in the middle of a line is ''medial'', and one near the end of a line is ''terminal.'' Initial and terminal caesurae are rare in formal, [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance]], and [[Neoclassical verse]], which prefer medial caesurae.

In music, a caesura denotes a brief, [[rest (music)|silent pause]], during which [[meter (music)|metrical time]] is not [[counting (music)|counted]]. Similar to a silent [[fermata]], caesurae are located between notes or [[bar (music)|measures]] (before or over [[bar (music)|bar lines]]), rather than on notes or rests (as with a fermata). A fermata may be placed over a caesura to indicate a longer pause.

==Mark==
{{main article|caesura mark}}
In verse [[scansion]], the modern '''caesura mark''' is a double [[vertical bar]] ⟨{{!}}{{!}}⟩ or ⟨‖⟩, a variant of the single-bar ''{{lang|la|virgula}}'' ("twig") used as a caesura mark in medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref name=verg&gt;{{citation |title=Oxford English Dictionary, ''1st ed.'' |contribution=virgule, ''n.'' |date=1917 |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same mark separately developed as the [[Slash (punctuation)|virgule]], the single slash used to mark line breaks in poetry.&lt;ref name=verg/&gt;

In [[musical notation]], a caesura is marked by a double oblique lines, similar to a pair of [[slash mark|slashes]] {{angle brackets|//}}. The symbol is popularly called "tram-lines" in the UK and "railroad tracks" in the US. It can also be marked by a [[quarter rest]] with a [[fermata]] over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700873/caesura |title= caesura |author=&lt;!--no byline.--&gt; |website= [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=20 December 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In choral works, a smaller [[apostrophe]]-like mark is used to denote caesurae.

==Examples==

===Homer===
Caesurae were widely used in [[Greek poetry]]. For example, in the opening line of the ''[[Iliad]]'':

:μῆνιν ἄειδε θεὰ || Πηληϊάδεω Ἀχιλῆος

:("Sing, o goddess || the rage of Achilles, the son of Peleus.")

This line includes a masculine caesura after θεὰ, a natural break that separates the line into two logical parts. Unlike the tragedians in their hexameters, Homeric lines more commonly employ feminine caesurae; this preference is observed to an even higher degree among the [[Alexandrian school|Alexandrian]] poets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=West|first1=M.L.|title=Greek Metre|date=1982|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=38; 98; 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
Caesurae were widely used in [[Latin poetry]], for example, in the opening line of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'':

:Arma virumque cano || Troiae qui primus ab oris

:(Of arms and the man, I sing. || Who first from the shores of Troy...)

This line uses caesura in the medial position. In dactylic hexameter, a caesura occurs any time the ending of a word does not coincide with the beginning or the end of a metrical foot; in modern prosody, however, it is only called one when the ending also coincides with an audible pause in the line.

The ancient [[elegiac couplet]] form of the Greeks and Romans contained a line of dactylic hexameter followed by a line of [[pentameter]]. The pentameter often displayed a clearer caesura, as in this example from [[Propertius]]:

:Cynthia prima fuit; || Cynthia finis erit.

:(Cynthia was the first; Cynthia will be the last)

===Old English===
In [[Old English]], the caesura has come to represent a pronounced pause in order to emphasize lines in Old English poetry that would otherwise be considered to be a droning, monotonous line.&lt;ref&gt;Bergman, Bennet. "Caesura." LitCharts LLC, May 5, 2017. Retrieved May 17, 2018. https://www.litcharts.com/literary-devices-and-terms/caesura.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the caesura arguably more important to the [[Old English language|Old English]] [[Old English poetry|verse]] than it was to Latin or Greek poetry. In Latin or Greek poetry, the caesura could be suppressed for effect in any line. In the [[alliterative verse]] that is shared by most of the oldest [[Germanic language]]s, the caesura is an ever-present and necessary part of the verse form itself. The opening line of ''[[Beowulf]]'' reads:

:Hwæt! We Gardena || in gear-dagum,
:þeodcyninga, || þrym gefrunon,
:hu ða æþelingas || ellen fremedon.

:(Behold! The Spear-Danes in days gone by,)
:(and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness,)
:(We have heard of these princes' heroic campaigns.)

The basic form is [[accentual verse]], with four stresses per line separated by a caesura. Old English poetry added alliteration and other devices to this basic pattern.

===Middle English===
[[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Ploughman]]'':

:I loked on my left half || as þe lady me taughte
:And was war of a woman || worþeli ycloþed.

:(I looked on my left half / as the lady me taught)
:(and was aware of a woman / worthily clothed.)

=== Kabir (Sant Kabir Das) ===
One of the widely used examples of caesurae in Indian poetry was in the 'dohas' or couplet poems of [[Kabir|Sant Kabir Das]], a 15th-century poet who was central to the Bhakthi Movement in [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gyanipandit.com/kabir-das-biography-in-hindi/|title=History of Sant Kabirdas|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of his doha or couplet:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|lang=hi|
कस्तूरी कुंडल बसे मृग ढूँढत बन माहि ।  
ज्यों घट घट में राम हैं दुनिया देखत नाहि ।।
|
Musk lies in the musk deer’s own nave । 
But roam in the forest he does – it to seek ।।&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://zocalopoets.com/2012/04/11/kabir-of-the-musk-deer-15th-century-hindi-poems/|title=Kabirdas Dohavali|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other examples===
Caesurae can occur in later forms of verse, where they are usually optional. The so-called [[ballad]] meter, or the [[common meter]] of the hymnodists (see also [[hymn]]), is usually thought of as a line of [[iambic tetrameter]] followed by a line of [[trimeter]], but it can also be considered a line of [[heptameter]] with a fixed caesura at the fourth foot.

Considering the break as a caesura in these verse forms, rather than a beginning of a new line, explains how sometimes multiple caesurae can be found in this verse form (from the [[ballad]], [[Tom o' Bedlam]]):

:From the hag and hungry goblin || that into rags would rend ye,
:And the spirits that stand || by the naked man || in the Book of Moons, defend ye!

In later and freer verse forms, the caesura is optional. It can, however, be used for rhetorical effect, as in [[Alexander Pope]]'s line:

:To err is human; || to forgive, divine.

===Polish===
Caesura is very important in Polish syllabic verse (as in French [[alexandrine]]).&lt;ref&gt;See Summary [in:] Lucylla Pszczołowska, ''Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny'', Wrocław 1997, p. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; Every line longer than eight syllables is divided into two half-lines.&lt;ref&gt;Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, ''Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim'', Kraków 2003, p. 14 (In Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; Lines composed of the same number of syllables with division in different place are considered to be completely different metrical patterns. For example, Polish alexandrine (13) is almost always divided 7+6. It has been very common in Polish poetry for last five centuries. But the metre 13(8+5) occurs only rarely and 13(6+7) can be hardly found. In Polish [[accentual-syllabic verse]] caesura is not so important but iambic tetrametre (very popular today) is usually 9(5+4).&lt;ref&gt;Lucylla Pszczołowska, o.c., p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; Caesura in Polish syllabic verse is almost always feminine, while in accentual-syllabic (especially iambic) verse it is often masculine: sSsSsSsS//sSsSsSsSs. There are also metrical patterns with two or three caesuras, for example 18[9(5+4)+9(5+4)].&lt;ref&gt;Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, o.c., p. 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York University]] Large Scale Emergency Readiness Project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/ccpr/laser/planc.html Large Scale Emergency Readiness Project]&lt;/ref&gt; applies [[agent-based modelling]] to simulate the effects of a large-scale [[disaster]].  Their initial project focused on modelling a 1998 Brazilian food-poisoning incident involving 8,000 injuries and 16 deaths.

Blast casualty prediction is routinely performed in the planning of [[military operations]].  For example, a [[cruise missile]] attack was considered by the United States in 1998 for [[Tarnak Farms]] in order to kill [[Osama bin Laden]]. However, not enough was known about the [[collateral damage]] effects of cruise missiles on [[Hut (dwelling)|mud huts]].   At the time there were estimated to be 100 women and children in the area, and in order to spare these civilians, the attack was not approved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghost Wars]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''comedian''' or '''comic''' is a person who seeks to [[entertainment|entertain]] an audience by making them [[Laughter|laugh]]. This might take many forms including [[Joke|jokes]], satirical observations, [[Amusement|amusing]] situations, acting foolish (as in [[Slapstick|slapstick]]) or employing [[prop comedy]]. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]]. Other practises include the [[sitcom]], [[sketch comedy]] and [[improvisational theatre|improv]].

A popular saying, variously quoted but generally attributed to [[Ed Wynn]],&lt;ref name=Bartleby&gt;{{cite web|title=Simpson's Contemporary Quotations, 1988|url=http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|accessdate=2008-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316092036/http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/8993.html|archivedate=2008-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, "A comic says funny things; a comedian says things funny", which draws a distinction between how much of the [[comedy]] can be attributed to verbal content and how much to acting and persona.

A lot of creative and original comedy is based on surrealism and absurdity. Early pioneers in these comedic forms include [[Spike Milligan]] and [[Monty Python]]. Current examples include [[Vic and Bob]], [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Sam Simmons (comedian)|Sam Simmons]]. Elements of surreal and absurd comedy include the non-sequitur (where language or events do not follow a logical process/sequence), irony (where a message is conveyed in a way contrary to its content) and deadpan performance (in the face of surreal and absurd situations, furthering the absurdity).

Since the 1980s, a new wave of comedy, called [[alternative comedy]], has grown in popularity with more offbeat and experimental style. Alternative comedy was initially inspired by [[punk subculture|punk culture]] and rejected old comedy forms, the establishment and bigoted humour. [[Ben Elton]], [[Rik Mayall]], [[Malcolm Hardee]] and [[Alexi Sayle]] were among the most well-known 1980's alternative comedians. Alternative comedy experienced a revival since around 2010, with [[Stewart Lee]] promoting the liberal, progressive values of the movement and many younger comedians in the UK banding together in groups dedicated to alternative comedy including [[The Alternative Comedy Memorial Society]] and [[Weirdos Comedy Club|the Weirdos Collective]].

Many comics achieve a [[cult following]] while touring famous comedy hubs such as the [[Just for Laughs]] festival in [[Montreal]], the [[Edinburgh Fringe]], and [[Melbourne Comedy Festival]] in [[Australia]]. Often a comic's career advances significantly when they win a notable comedy award, such as the [[Edinburgh Comedy Award]] (formerly the Perrier comedy award). Comics sometimes foray into other areas of entertainment, such as film and television, where they become more widely known; e.g., [[Eddie Izzard]] or [[Ricky Gervais]].  However, a comic's stand-up success does not guarantee a film's critical or box office success.

==History==
===Ancient Greeks===
{{See also|Ancient Greek comedy}}
Comedians can be dated back to 425 BC, when [[Aristophanes]], a comic author and playwright, wrote ancient comedic plays. He wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive and are still being performed. Aristophanes' comedy style took the form of [[satyr plays]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Lysistrata | author=Aristophanes | pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shakespearean comedy===
{{See also|Shakespearean comedy}}
The English poet and playwright [[William Shakespeare]] wrote many comedies. A Shakespearean comedy is one that has a happy ending, usually involving marriages between the unmarried characters, and a tone and style that is more light-hearted than Shakespeare's other plays.

===Modern era===
[[File:Chaplin The Champion.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] in the film ''[[The Champion (1915 film)|The Champion]]'', 1915]]

[[Charlie Chaplin]] was the most popular screen comedian of the first half of the 20th century. Chaplin and [[Stan Laurel]] were protégés of [[Fred Karno]], the English theatre impresario of British [[music hall]], and in his biography Laurel stated, "Fred Karno didn't teach Charlie [Chaplin] and me all we know about comedy. He just taught us most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burton|first1=Alan|title=Pimple, pranks &amp; pratfalls: British film comedy before 1930|date=2000|publisher=Flicks Books|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaplin wrote comedic [[silent films]] such as ''[[Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'' and ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]''. His films still have a major impact on comedy in films today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.montgomerycollege.edu/Departments/hpolscrv/msiegler.htm | title=Charlie Chaplin Biography | date=1 May 2001 | accessdate=2 December 2013 | author=Sigler, Michael S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular forms of modern-day comedy is [[stand-up comedy]]. Stand-up comedy is a comic monologue performed by one or more people standing on a stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stand-up+comedy?s=t | title='stand-up comedy' definition | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bob Hope]] was the most popular stand-up comedian of the 20th century, and also starred in numerous comedy films over a five-decade span.  Other noted stand-up comedians include [[Billy Connolly]], [[George Carlin]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[Mort Sahl]], [[Louis CK]] and [[Chris Rock]].

[[Radio]] has been a proving-ground for many comedians. [[Ricky Gervais]] career began at a London radio station called [[XFM]] and [[Chris Morris (satirist)]] began his career at Radio Cambridgeshire. [[The League of Gentlemen]], [[Mitchell and Webb]] and [[The Mighty Boosh]] all transferred to television after broadcasting on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Between 2002 and 2011 [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] used to feature regular shows presented by comedians including [[Phil Jupitus]], [[Stephen Merchant]] and [[Adam &amp; Joe]]. Now BBC radio comedy is mainly available on BBC Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]. Before television, radio was one of the main ways to enjoy comedy, [[The Goon Show]] and [[Hancock's Half Hour]] being among the most popular early shows.

On television there are comedy talk shows where comedians make fun of current news or popular topics. Such comedians include [[Jay Leno]], [[Conan O'Brien]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Daniel Tosh]], [[Chris Hardwick]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[David Letterman]], and [[Chelsea Handler]]. There are sketch comedies, such as [[Kids In The Hall and [[Monty Python]] who created their sketch comedy show ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (a [[BBC]] show that influenced ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), then there are sitcoms, for example [[Friends]], [[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]] and [[Father Ted]], as well as popular panel shows like [[QI]], [[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]] and [[8 out of 10 Cats]].

Comedy is increasingly enjoyed online. Comedians with popular long-running podcasts series include [[Ricky Gervais]], [[Richard Herring]] and [[Scott Aukerman]]. Comedians streaming video of their standup include [[Bridget Christie]], [[Louis C.K.]] and [[Daniel Kitson]]. Many comedians publicise their work and build an audience through social media, especially [[Twitter]].

==Jokes==
There are many established formats for jokes. One example is the [[pun]] or double-entendre, where similar words are interchanged. [[The Two Ronnies]] often used puns and double-entendre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12068221 BBC News - Ronnie Corbett Christmas Return]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bec Hill]] and [[Tim Vine]] are examples of current comedians who deploy numerous puns. Jokes based on puns tend to be very quick and easy to digest, which sometimes leads to other joke forms being overlooked, for example in the Funniest Joke of the Fringe awards. Other jokes may rely on confounding an audience's expectations through a misleading setup (known as a 'pull back and reveal' in the UK and a 'leadaway' in the US).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ed Byrne (comedian)|Ed Byrne]] is an example of a comedian who has used this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chortle.co.uk/correspondents/2010/09/22/11771/missing_a_trick Chortle - Missing A Trick]&lt;/ref&gt; Some jokes are based on [[ad absurdum]] extrapolations, for example much of [[Richard Herring]] and [[Ross Noble]]'s standup.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQ9eqdqQLXw Russel Howard's Good News Extra]&lt;/ref&gt;. In [[irony|ironic]] humour there is an intentional mismatch between a message and the form in which it is conveyed (for example the work of [[Danielle Ward]]). Other joke forms include observation (eg. [[Peter Kay]]), whimsy (eg. [[Bill Bailey]]), self-deprecation (eg. [[Daniel Kitson]]) and parody (eg. [[Jennifer Saunders]]).

==Personality traits==
In a January 2014 study, conducted in the ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'',  scientists found that comedians tend to have high levels of [[psychotic]] personality traits. In the study, researchers analyzed 404 male and 119 female comedians from [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]]. The participants were asked to complete an online questionnaire designed to measure psychotic traits in healthy people. They found that comedians scored "significantly higher on four types of psychotic characteristics compared to a control group of people who had non-creative jobs." Gordon Claridge, a professor of experimental psychology at the [[University of Oxford]] and leader of the study claimed, "the creative elements needed to produce humor are strikingly similar to those characterizing the cognitive style of people with psychosis—both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."&lt;ref name=Kelland-Psychotic&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelland|first=Kate|title=Comedians have psychotic personality traits, study finds|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/16/us-comedians-psychotic-idUSBREA0F00M20140116|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, labeling comedians' personality traits as "psychotic" does not mean that individual is a psychopath,&lt;ref name=Seubsaeng-Study&gt;{{cite news|last=Suebsaeng|first=Asawin|title=Study Says Comedians Have Psychotic Personality Traits—Here's What Some Comedians Have To Say About That|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/01/study-comedians-psychotic-traits-rob-delaney-steve-hofstetter|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Mother Jones|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cooper-White&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooper-White|first=Macrina|title=Comedians Have 'High Levels' Of Psychotic Personality Traits, New Study Shows|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/comedians-psychotic-personality-traits_n_4610414.html|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since [[psychopathy]] is distinct from [[psychosis]], and neither does it mean their behavior is necessarily pathological.

'''Communicative planning''' is an approach to [[urban planning]] that gathers stakeholders and engages them in a process to make decisions together in a manner that respects the positions of all involved.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Planning: Shaping Places in Fragmented Societies|last=Healey|first=Patsy|publisher=UBC Press|year=1997|isbn=0774805986|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes called collaborative planning among planning practitioners or collaborative planning model.

== History and theory ==
Since the 1970s, communicative planning theory has formed based on several key understandings. These key points include the notions that communication and reasoning come in diverse forms, knowledge is socially constructed, and people’s diverse interests and preferences are formed out of their social contexts.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Healey|first=Patsy|year=1996|title=The Communicative Turn in Planning Theory and its Implications for Spatial Strategy Formation|url=|journal=Readings in Planning Theory|volume=23|pages=217–234|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/b230217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative theory also draws on [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] analyses of power in that it recognizes that power relations exist in practice and have the ability to oppress individuals.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Specific to a community and urban planning context, communicative theory acknowledges that planners' own actions, words, lived experiences, and communication styles have an effect on the planning process the planner is facilitating.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Finally, communicative planning theory advances the idea that planning happens in everyday practice and social relations, and consensus-building can be used to organize people's thoughts and move past traditional ways of knowing and decision-making.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

In the 1990s, a number of planning scholars began writing about a new orientation to urban planning theory that moved away from the prevalent rational approach to planning. [[Judith Innes]] is credited with coining the term "communicative planning" in her article ''Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice.''&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith|year=1995|title=Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/14/3/183.extract|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=14|pages=183–189|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0739456x9501400307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innes' tries to bridge the gap between planning theories and planning in practice, and offers consensus-building as a tool for urban planners to create collaborative and engaging planning environments that allow different stakeholders to participate.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-12-31|title=Consensus Building and Complex Adaptive Systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369908976071|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=4|pages=412–423|doi=10.1080/01944369908976071|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booher|first=David E.|last2=Innes|first2=Judith E.|date=2002-03-01|title=Network Power in Collaborative Planning|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/21/3/221|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=221–236|doi=10.1177/0739456X0202100301|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-03-31|title=Consensus Building as Role Playing and Bricolage|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944369908976031|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/01944369908976031|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Around the same time as this article was published, Patsy Healey also published a number of planning theory texts exploring communicative and collaborative planning. Drawing on the theory of [[Jürgen Habermas]] in particular, Healey's work focuses on the impact that communicative acts (which can be in spoken or written form) have on a community planning process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Healey also expands on the work of urban planner [[John F. Forester]] and economic geographer [[Bent Flyvbjerg]], both of whom examine Habermasian communication and power structures in their planning work.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The emerging field of therapeutic planning is closely related to communicative planning. Therapeutic planning operates on the basis that communities can experience collective trauma, including from past planning processes, and that carefully facilitated community engagement can act as catalysts for community-wide healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erfan|first=Aftab|date=2016-11-21|title=Confronting collective traumas: an exploration of therapeutic planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|journal=Planning Theory &amp; Practice|volume=0|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|issn=1464-9357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aftab|first=Erfan,|date=2013-09-09|title=An experiment in therapeutic planning : learning with the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw First Nations|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0074273|doi=10.14288/1.0074273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ENsYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=therapeutic+planning+community&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6BKoIae-W0&amp;sig=cRmujL8p6qsJhL9fG0b_YN6ZFXc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS6djzttfQAhUG9GMKHXhZBaAQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=therapeutic%20planning%20community&amp;f=false|title=The Global City and the Holy City: Narratives on Knowledge, Planning and Diversity|last=Fenster|first=Tovi|date=2016-09-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317880097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some planning practitioners use untraditional planning approaches, such as filmmaking and other artistic media, to engage community members in therapeutic planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Leonie|last2=Attili|first2=Giovanni|date=2014-01-16|title=Changing the Lens Film as Action Research and Therapeutic Planning Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/16/0739456X13516499|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|pages=0739456X13516499|doi=10.1177/0739456X13516499|issn=0739-456X|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicative process and tools ==
In a communicative planning process, planning practitioners play more of a facilitative role. They often act as a ‘knowledge mediator and broker’&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; to help reframe problems in order to promote more creative thinking about possible solutions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning in divided cities: collaborative shaping of contested space|last=Gaffikin|first=Frank|last2=Morrissey|first2=Mike|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-405-19218-7|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this process, information should be produced collectively by the full range of stakeholders who may be affected by the outcome of the process.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=1998-03-31|title=Information in Communicative Planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369808975956|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=64|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1080/01944369808975956|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, all of the stakeholders should be involved in negotiating both the problem definition and the solution together.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In doing so, solutions to conflicts amongst stakeholders may be re-framed as ‘win-win’, as opposed to the ‘zero sum’ mindset which occurs when stakeholders are bargaining on the basis of their own fixed interests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Consensus-building is an important part of this collective meaning-making process, as information is discussed and validated within the group of sakeholders, resulting in information which holds more significance to the group.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

To aid in consensus-building efforts, power should be distributed amongst the stakeholders such that they are equals in the process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Openness and trust are also crucial for building consensus.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The objectives, underlying assumptions, and positions of these stakeholders should be considered along with the uncertainties about future conditions, such as population growth, and decisions which are linked to other decisions.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Arnab|date=2012-03-01|title=Recognizing Uncertainty and Linked Decisions in Public Participation: A New Framework for Collaborative Urban Planning|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2102/abstract|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=131–148|doi=10.1002/sres.2102|issn=1099-1743}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to have the stakeholders identify this information for themselves, as it will help reduce the biases present in both analyses driven by only one future and position-based discussions, as well as bring to the forefront any conflicts between the underlying values of the stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By considering this broad range of information, commonalities between different stakeholders may be identified, which can help build consensus. However, this cannot guarantee consensus, as positions might in fact be too different.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In order to deal with the challenges that arise from positions being very different and the increasing complexity of analysis required, new models of collaboration are needed which build on various principles of conflict management, including engaging early and engaging often.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==  Case studies  ==

'''The Neighbourhood Revitalization Program (NRP) - 1990'''

In 1990, the city of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] launched a 20-year program designed to empower residents in local decision making and share community planning responsibilities among residential, government and private stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elwood|date=2002|title=Neighbourhood Revitalization through Collaboration: Assessing the implications of neoliberal urban policy at the grassroots.|journal=GeoJournal|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the dwindling standard of living within Minneapolis neighbourhoods, the NRP was conceptualized as a means of involving citizens in the prioritization of revitalization efforts. The Minneapolis government divided 400 million dollars between 81 neighbourhood organizations who utilized the funding over two decades to assess priorities, reach consensus and implement neighbourhood improvement projects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the first decade of the NRP, 48% of funding was used for upgrading housing and 16% went towards job creation and economic developments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=J.|last2=Pentel|first2=P.|date=2002|title=What the Neighbours Want: The Neighborhood Revitalization Program's First Decade.|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=68|issue=4|pages=435–449|doi=10.1080/01944360208976284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other priorities included public safety, the preservation of green space and improving transportation infrastructure.

Through the completion and adoption of 66 unique neighbourhood plans, stakeholders from various organizations including the general public, [[Minneapolis Public Library]], Minneapolis Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Housing Inspection and [[Hennepin County]] all came together to articulate and agree upon feasible and mutually beneficial neighbourhood directives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fung|date=2006|title=Empowered Participation in Urban Governance: The Minneapolis Revitalization Program.|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=30|issue=3|pages=638–655|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2006.00685.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; With emphasis placed on citizen participation, municipal planners took on an advisory role and assisted neighbourhood planning organizations in encouraging participation, engaging a diverse audience and reviewing completed plans through a technical lens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite the creation of Participation Agreements which stood as formal commitments to holding an inclusive engagement process, the NRP has been criticized for a lack of representation from all neighbourhood members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While the NRP has been applauded for its communicative and collaborative values, critics point to cases of exclusion and the enormous amount of continuous time and energy required for its success as main drawbacks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Seattle's Neighbourhood Planning Program - 1994'''

In 1994, [[Seattle]] developed the Neighbourhood Planning Program (NPP) in response to outcry from the general public surrounding a lack of involvement in a recently completed comprehensive plan.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siranni|first=Carmen|date=2007|title=Neighbourhood Planning as Collaborative Design|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=73|issue=4|pages=373–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPP intended to build a partnership between residents and the local government and provided neighbourhoods with the choice to create their own unique local plan or continue by the comprehensive plan. While these neighbourhood plans had to be consistent with the broad goals of the comprehensive plan, participating neighbourhoods were afforded the opportunity to identify their own priorities and provide a list of recommendations to the city.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Initially, each participating neighbourhood was given 10,000 dollars to begin a communicative engagement process and identify a vision for their local community.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neighbor Power: Building Community the Seattle Way|last=Diers|first=Jim|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding for the planning stage would not be rewarded until the City felt as though enough stakeholders and community representatives had been included in the process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Community Capacity: How collaborative planning is changing the culture of governance in Seattle.|last=Kobler|first=A|publisher=Iowa State University ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the visioning process was deemed to be inclusive and rigorous, the city provided each neighbourhood with between 60,000-100,000 dollars to develop a plan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In total, 38 neighbourhoods participated and developed their own neighbourhood plan for the municipality to follow.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Before approving each neighbourhood plan, the municipality would hold public hearings in the neighbourhood to share the plan and ensure there was consensus among all the residents in the area.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  By 1999, the City had adopted these plans and began implementing the shared visions of each neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Each plan varied significantly as each neighbourhood was afforded the opportunity to hire their own planner or consultants to assist them in the process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Planning professionals participated in the process mainly as mediators who helped guide participatory sessions and facilitated the consensus-building process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 20, 000 and 30, 000 residents participated directly in the NPP.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The program has been recognized as a successful example of communicative planning and [[collaborative governance]] due to the high level of participation and the frequency with which consensus was genuinely reached.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==  Challenges and critiques ==
Critiques of Innes, Healey, and communicative planning focus on the planning processes and outcomes.

Older critiques of communicative planning theory question whether the theory they find idealist can translate a consensus-based process into authentic outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewdwr-Jones|first=M.|last2=Allmendinger|first2=P.|date=1998-11-01|title=Deconstructing Communicative Rationality: A Critique of Habermasian Collaborative Planning|url=http://epn.sagepub.com/content/30/11/1975|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=30|issue=11|pages=1975–1989|doi=10.1068/a301975|issn=0308-518X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also question whether consensus is a valuable goal when they see critical planning decisions as being made gradually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aetrlrhK37sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=rationality+and+power&amp;ots=a7lj21LT2d&amp;sig=0_-GsZZkld1rJoEsk3Ui8Y_pT4s#v=onepage&amp;q=rationality%20and%20power&amp;f=false|title=Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|date=1998-02-28|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226254494|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional critiques relate to power: who has the power to exclude and include stakeholders and whether stakeholders will use their power to manipulate the consensus building process (given that consensus must be reached).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older critiques of communicative planning practice also see a lack of real world outcomes from the communicative planning processes because deeper political and institutional change is needed first.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Judith Innes directly responded to these critiques in her article ''Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=2004-03-01|title=Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/3/1/5|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–20|doi=10.1177/1473095204042315|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she expanded her description of the consensus building process and communicative planning's roots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Newer [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] critiques argue collaborative planning is a way to maintain larger political and institutional systems while creating a process that only seems to better represent the public.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=Mark|date=2009-05-01|title=Resisting Neoliberalization: Communicative Planning or Counter-Hegemonic Movements?|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/8/2/140|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=140–165|doi=10.1177/1473095209102232|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see collaborative planning as a way to keep neoliberals in power and political systems stable, rather than creating real changes to the governing system.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

The CSIs that are restricted to a particular [[clade]] or group of species, generally provide good [[phylogenetic tree|phylogenetic markers]] of common evolutionary descent.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt; Due to the rarity and highly specific nature of such changes, it is less likely that they could arise independently by either [[Convergent evolution|convergent]] or [[parallel evolution]] (i.e. homoplasy) or [[synapomorphy]]. Other confounding factors such as differences in evolutionary rates at different sites or among different species also generally do not affect the interpretation of a CSI.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta 2002" /&gt; By determining the presence or absence of CSIs in an out-group species, one can infer whether the ancestral form of the CSI was an insert or deletion and this can be used to develop a rooted phylogenetic relationship among organisms.&lt;ref name="Baldauf 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;

Most CSIs that have been identified have been found to exhibit high predictive value and they generally retain the specificity for the originally identified clades of species. Therefore, based upon their presence or absence, it should be possible to identify both known and even previously unknown species belonging to these groups in different environments.&lt;ref name="Gupta 2002" /&gt;

==Types==

=== Group specific ===
[[File:Group indel picture.png|thumb|center|upright=3.0|'''Figure 1:''' Example of a group specific Conserved signature indel (CSIs), that is specific for species from taxon X. The dashes in the alignments indicate the presence of an amino acid identical to that on the top line.]]

Group specific CSIs are commonly shared by different species belonging to a particular [[Taxon]](e.g. genus, family, class, order, phylum) but they are not present in other groups. These CSIs were most likely introduced in an ancestor of the group of species before the members of the [[Taxon|taxa]] diverged. They provide molecular means for distinguishing members of a particular taxon from all other organisms.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rokas /&gt;

'''Figure 1'''  shows an example of 5aa CSI found in all species belonging to the taxon X. This is a distinctive characteristic of this taxon as it is not found in any other species. This signature was likely introduced in a common ancestor of the species from this taxon. Similarly other group-specific signatures (not shown) could be shared by either A1 and A2 or B1 and B2, etc., or even by X1 and X2 or by X3 and X4, etc. The groups A, B, C, D and X, in this diagram could correspond to various bacterial or [[Eukaryotic]] phyla.&lt;ref name="gupta web"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gupta|first=Radhey|title=Conserved Inserts and Deletions in Protein Sequences|url=http://www.bacterialphylogeny.info/|work=Bacterial Phylogeny|publisher=Gupta RS|accessdate=2 April 2012}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group specific CSIs have been used in the past to determine the phylogenetic relationship of a number of bacterial phyla and subgroups within it. For example a 3 amino acid insert was uniquely shared by members of the phylum [[Thermotogae]] in the essential [[ribosomal protein|50S ribosomal protein L7/L12]], within a highly conserved region (82-124 amino acid). This is not present in any other bacteria species and could be used to characterize members of the phylum [[Thermotogae]] from all other bacteria. Group specific CSIs were also used to characterize subgroups within the phylum [[Thermotogae]].&lt;ref name=vaibhav&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10482-011-9576-z |title=Phylogeny and molecular signatures for the phylum Thermotogae and its subgroups |year=2011 |last1=Gupta |first1=Radhey S. |last2=Bhandari |first2=Vaibhav |journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek |volume=100 |pages=1–34 |pmid=21503713 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multi group or main-line ===

[[File:mainline indel picture.png|thumb|center|upright=3.0|'''Figure 2:''' Multi group or Main-Line Conserved signature indel (CSI). The dashes in indicate the presence of an amino acid identical to that on the top line.]]

Main-line CSIs are those in which a conserved insert or deletion is shared by several major phyla, but absent from other phyla.&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;

'''Figure 2''' shows an example of 5aa CSI found in a conserved region that is commonly present in the species belonging to phyla X, Y and Z, but it is absent in other phyla (A, B and C). This signature indicates a specific relationship of taxa X, Y and Z and also A, B and C. Based upon the presence or absence of such an indel, in out-group species (viz. Archaea), it can be inferred whether the indel is an insert or a deletion, and which of these two groups A, B, C or X, Y, Z is ancestral.&lt;ref name="gupta web" /&gt;

Main-line CSIs have been used in the past to determine the phylogenetic relationship of a number of bacterial phyla. The large CSI of about 150-180 amino acids within a conserved region of [[Type II topoisomerase|Gyrase B]] (between amino acids 529-751), is commonly shared between various [[Proteobacteria]], [[Chlamydiales]], [[Planctomycetes]] and [[Aquificae|Aquificales]] species. This CSI is absent in other ancestral bacterial phyla as well as [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name="gyr B"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1099/mic.0.2007/009118-0 |title=Phylogeny and shared conserved inserts in proteins provide evidence that Verrucomicrobia are the closest known free-living relatives of chlamydiae |year=2007 |last1=Griffiths |first1=E. |last2=Gupta |first2=R. S. |journal=Microbiology |volume=153 |issue=8 |pmid=17660429 |pages=2648–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a large CSI of about 100 amino acids in [[RpoB]] homologs (between amino acids 919-1058) is present in various species belonging to [[Proteobacteria]],  [[Chlorobium|Bacteroidetes-Chlorobi]], [[Chlamydiales]], [[Planctomycetes]] and [[Aquificae|Aquificales]]. This CSI is absent in other ancestral bacterial phyla as well as [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name="rpo gupta"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1024999314839 |year=2003 |last1=Gupta |first1=Radhey S. |journal=Photosynthesis Research |volume=76 |pages=173–83 |pmid=16228576 |title=Evolutionary relationships among photosynthetic bacteria |issue=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rpo griffiths"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15179606 |year=2004 |last1=Griffiths |first1=Emma |last2=Gupta |first2=Radhey S. |title=Signature sequences in diverse proteins provide evidence for the late divergence of the Order ''Aquificales'' |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=41–52 |journal=International Microbiology |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/25march04/07%20Griffiths.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases one can infer that the groups lacking the CSI are ancestral.

A key issue in bacterial phylogeny is to understand how different bacterial species are related to each other and their branching order from a common ancestor. Currently most phylogenetic trees are based on [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S rRNA]] or other genes/proteins. These trees are not always able to resolve key phylogenetic questions with a high degree of certainty.&lt;ref name="tree 1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/90129 |year=2001 |last1=Brown |first1=James R. |last2=Douady |first2=Christophe J. |last3=Italia |first3=Michael J. |last4=Marshall |first4=William E. |last5=Stanhope |first5=Michael J. |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=281–5 |pmid=11431701 |title=Universal trees based on large combined protein sequence data sets}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tree 2"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11837318 |year=2002 |last1=Cavalier-Smith |first1=T |title=The neomuran origin of archaebacteria, the negibacterial root of the universal tree and bacterial megaclassification |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=7–76 |doi=10.1099/00207713-52-1-7|journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11837318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tree 3"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1123061 |title=Toward Automatic Reconstruction of a Highly Resolved Tree of Life |year=2006 |last1=Ciccarelli |first1=F.

The genetic events leading to them are postulated to have occurred at important evolutionary branch points and their species distribution patterns provide valuable information regarding the branching order and interrelationships among different bacterial phyla.&lt;ref name="Baldauf 1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta 1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name=vaibhav /&gt;

=== Thermotogae ===

Recently the phylogenetic relationship of the group [[Thermotogae]] was characterized based on the CSI approach. Previously no biochemical or [[molecular markers]] were known that could clearly distinguish the species of this phylum from all other bacteria. More than 60 CSIs that were specific for the entire Thermotogae phylum or its different subgroups were discovered. 18 CSIs are uniquely present in various Thermotogae species and provide molecular markers for the phylum. Additionally there were many CSIs that were specific for various thermotogae subgroups. 12 CSIs were specific for a clade consisting of various Thermotoga species except Tt. Lettingae. 14CSIs were specific for a clade consisting of the Fervidobacterium and Thermosipho genera and 18 CSIs were specific for the genus Thermosiphon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Lastly 16 CSIs were reported that were shared by either some or all Thermotogae species or some species from other taxa such as [[Archaea]], [[Aquificae]], [[Firmicutes]], [[Proteobacteria]], [[Deinococcus]], [[Fusobacteria]], [[Dictyoglomus]], [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|Chloroflexi]] and [[eukaryotes]]. The shared presence of some of these CSIs could be due to [[Horizontal gene transfer|lateral gene transfer (LGT)]] between these groups. However the number of CSIs that are commonly shared with other taxa is much smaller than those that are specific for Thermotogae and they do not exhibit any specific pattern. Hence they have no significant effect on the distinction of Thermotogae.&lt;ref name=vaibhav /&gt;

=== Archaea ===
Mesophillic [[Crenarchaeotes]] were recently placed into a new phylum of [[Archaea]] called the [[Thaumarchaeota]]. However there are very few molecular markers that can distinguish this group of archaea from the phylum Crenarchaeota. A detailed phylogenetic study using the CSI approach was conducted to distinguish these phyla in molecular terms. 6 CSIs were uniquely found in various Thaumarchaeota, namely ''[[Cenarchaeum symbiosum]]'', ''[[Nitrosopumilus maritimus]]'' and a number of uncultured marine crenarchaeotes. 3 CSIs were found that were commonly shared between species belonging to Thaumarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Additionally, a number of CSIs were found that are specific for different orders of  Crenarchaeota- 3 CSIs for [[Sulfolobales]], 5 CSIs for [[Thermoproteales]], lastly 2 CSIs common for [[Sulfolobales]] and [[Desulfurococcales]]. The signatures described provide novel means for distinguishing Crenarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota, additionally they could be used as a tool for the classification and identification of related species.&lt;ref name="Ali shami"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10482-010-9488-3 |title=Molecular signatures for the Crenarchaeota and the Thaumarchaeota |year=2010 |last1=Gupta |first1=Radhey S. |last2=Shami |first2=Ali |journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=133–57 |pmid=20711675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pasteurellales ===

The members of the order [[Pasteurellales]] are currently distinguished mainly based on their position in the branching of the 16srRNA tree. There are currently very few molecular markers known that can distinguish members of this order from other bacteria. A CSI approach was recently used to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships between the species in this order; more than 40 CSIs were discovered that were uniquely shared by all or most of the species. Two major clades are formed within this Pasteurellales: Clade I, encompassing [[Aggregatibacter]], [[Pasteurella]], Actinobacillus succinogenes, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, [[Haemophilus influenzae]] and Haemophilus somnus, was supported by 13 CSIs. Clade II, encompassing Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Actinobacillus minor, [[Haemophilus ducreyi]], Mannheimia haemolytica and Haemophilus parasuis, was supported by 9 CSIs. Based on these results, it was proposed that Pasteurellales be divided from its current one family into two different ones. Additionally, the signatures described would provide novel means of identifying undiscovered Pasteurellales species.&lt;ref name="sohail new"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10482-011-9628-4 |title=Molecular signatures (conserved indels) in protein sequences that are specific for the order Pasteurellales and distinguish two of its main clades |year=2011 |last1=Naushad |first1=Hafiz Sohail |last2=Gupta |first2=Radhey S. |journal=Antonie van Leeuwenhoek |volume=101 |pages=105–24 |pmid=21830122 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gammaproteobacteria ===
The class [[Gammaproteobacteria]] forms one of the largest groups of bacteria. It is currently distinguished from other bacteria solely by [[16s rRNA]]-based phylogenetic trees. No molecular characteristics unique to the class or its different subgroups are known. A detailed CSI-based study was conducted to better understand the phylogeny of this class. Firstly, a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of a number of universally-distributed proteins was created. The branching order of the different [[Order (biology)|orders]] of the [[Class (biology)|class]] Gammaproteobacteria (from most recent to the earliest diverging) was: [[Enterobacteriales]] &gt;[[Pasteurellales]] &gt;[[Vibrionales]], [[Aeromonadales]] &gt;[[Alteromonadales]] &gt;[[Oceanospirillales]], [[Pseudomonadales]] &gt;[[Chromatiales]], [[Legionellales]], [[Methylococcales]], [[Xanthomonadales]], [[Cardiobacteriales]], [[Thiotrichales]]. Additionally, 4 CSIs were discovered that were unique to most species of the class Gammaproteobacteria. A 2 aa deletion in [[Phosphoribosylaminoimidazolecarboxamide formyltransferase|AICAR transformylase]] was uniquely shared by all gammaproteobacteria except for [[Francisella tularensis]]. A 4 aa deletion in [[RNA polymerase|RNA polymerase b-subunit]] and a 1 aa deletion in [[Ribosomal protein|ribosomal protein L16]]  were found uniquely in various species belonging to the orders [[Enterobacteriales]], [[Pasteurellales]], [[Vibrionales]], [[Aeromonadales]] and [[Alteromonadales]], but were not found in other gammaproteobacteria. Lastly, a 2 aa deletion in [[leucyl-tRNA synthetase]] was commonly present in the above orders of the class Gammaproteobacteria and in some members of the order [[Oceanospirillales]].&lt;ref name="Gupta Xantha"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1099/ijs.0.002741-0 |title=Phylogenomics and protein signatures elucidating the evolutionary relationships among the Gammaproteobacteria |year=2009 |last1=Gao |first1=B. |last2=Mohan |first2=R. |last3=Gupta |first3=R. S. |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |volume=59 |issue=2 |pmid=19196760 |pages=234–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another CSI based study has also identified 4 CSIs that are exclusive to the order Xanthomonadales. Taken together, these two facts show that Xanthomonadales is a [[Monophyly|monophyletic group]] that is ancestral to other Gammaproteobacteria, which further shows that Xanthomonadales is an independent subdivision, and constitutes one of the deepest-branching lineages within the Gammaproteobacteria clade.&lt;ref name=Cutino-Jimenez /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gupta Xantha" /&gt;

=== Fungi ===
The exact phylogenetic relationship between [[plants]], [[animals]] and [[fungi]] is not well understood. A small CSI-based study was conducted to elucidate this relationship. Four CSIs were used to place animals and fungi together as a monophyletic group, and exclude plants. These CSIs were found in two essential cellular proteins, [[Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1|elongation factor l]] and [[enolase]]. However, traditionally, this specific relationship between fungi and animals has not been supported.&lt;ref name="Baldauf 1993" /&gt;

It also helps to explain other forms of [[consciousness]]: creative [[imagination]], [[thought]], the formation of beliefs and motivations ...

It is based on two key assumptions: imagination is a simulation of [[perception]], brain registrations of memories are self-excitatory neural networks (neurons can activate each other). 

== Definition ==
A '''convergence-divergence zone''' (CDZ) is a neural network which receives convergent projections from the sites whose activity is to be recorded, and which returns divergent projections to the same sites. When an experiment is recorded, the signals that converge on the CDZ excite their neurons which strengthen their mutual connections (according to the [[Hebbian theory]]) and thus form a self-excitatory network. The excitation of this network is then enough to reproduce the combination of initially received signals. In a self-excitatory network the excitation of a part spreads to all the others, just like a memory fragment awakens an entire recorded experience. A CDZ is thus the place of recording and reproduction of memories. It is both a detector and a signal producer (forms of neuronal activation). This is the basic neural mechanism that explains memories and other forms of imagination.

== Arborescences of CDZ ==
In addition to convergent-divergent paths, a CDZ may be connected to the rest of the brain in every imaginable way, by input signals that activate or inhibit it, and output signals with which it influences the rest of the system. In particular CDZs may be organized into a system and form an arborescence. A CDZ may recruit converging input channels from many other CDZs. It can thus make a synthesis of detection and production capabilities of all the CDZs thus recruited.

To make a model of the CDZ system, we distinguish in the nervous system a peripheral part and a central one, with a gradual progression from the periphery to the center. The periphery includes all sources of perception: the feeling of the outside and inside, emotions and actions. The periphery, thus understood, includes all cortical sensory, emotional and motor areas, and all intracerebral nuclei that contribute to their functioning.

The CDZ system is organized in a hierarchical fashion, from the periphery to the center. The most peripheral CDZs have convergent paths directly from the periphery. We approach the center going up the arborescence of CDZs. One can think of roots that plunge into the earth, the periphery, and converge to the base of the trunk, the center. But in the brain, there are a large number of centers. The most central CDZs have converging projections from other CDZs, and are not recruited by a more central CDZ. The memory of an episode of our life is preserved in such central CDZs. When we relive the perceptions, emotions and actions of a past experience, the excitation of this central CDZs activates all subordinated CDZs and the peripheral areas. It thereby reconstructs the previously lived experience.

In [[computability theory]] a '''cylindric numbering''' is a special kind of [[numbering (computability theory)|numbering]] first introduced by [[Yuri L. Ershov]] in 1973. 

If a numberings &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is [[reducibility (numbering)|reducible]] to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; then there exists a computable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\nu = \mu \circ f&lt;/math&gt;. Usually &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not [[injective]] but if &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a cylindric numbering we can always find an injective &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. 

== Definition ==

A numbering &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is called '''cylindric''' if 
:&lt;math&gt;\nu \equiv_1 c(\nu).&lt;/math&gt;
That is if it is [[one equivalent numbering|one-equivalent]] to its [[cylindrification]]

A set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is called '''cylindric''' if its [[indicator function]] 
:&lt;math&gt;1_S: \mathbb{N} \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; 
is a cylindric numbering.

== Examples ==

* every [[Gödel numbering]] is cylindric

== Properties ==

* cylindric numberings are [[idempotent]], &lt;math&gt;\nu \circ \nu = \nu&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3536">'''Ecological self''' is central to the school of ''Experiential [[Deep Ecology]]'', which, based on the work of Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]], argues that through the process of self-actualisation, one transcends the nations of the individuated "egoic" self and arrives at a position of an ecological self.  So long as one is working within the narrower concept of self, Næss argues, environmentally responsible behaviour is a form of altruism, a "doing good for the other", which historically has been a precarious ethical basis, usually involved in exhorting others to "be good".  Næss argues that in his [[Ecosophy]], the enlargement of the ego-self to the eco-self results in environmentally responsible behaviour as a form of self-interest.

[[Warwick Fox]] argued that Næss's philosophy was based upon a variety of "transpersonal ecology" in which self-interest was firmly embedded within the interest of the ecommunity ecosphere of which the self was eternally embedded&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Warwick (1990). ''Toward a Transpersonal Ecology: Developing New Foundations for Environmentalism''. (Boston and London: Shambhala Publications).&lt;/ref&gt;

As deep ecologist [[John Seed]] has stated, "Deep ecology critiques the idea that we are the crown of creation, the measure of all being: that the world is a pyramid with humanity rightly on top, merely a resource, and that nature has instrumental value only".&lt;ref&gt;Seed, John, (2004). "The Ecological Self". (''EarthLight Magazine'' 53, Spring 2005 Vol. 14, No. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of the Ecological Self goes beyond [[anthropocentrism]], which, by contrast locates human concerns as the exclusive source of all value.  It draws upon the Land Ethic of [[Aldo Leopold]].  Leopold argued that within conventional ethics, the land itself was considered only as property, occupying a role analogous to slavery in earlier societies that permitted the ownership of people.  By comparison a land ethic enlarges the boundary of moral concern to include "soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land".  The basis of such a non-[[anthropocentric]] ethic, according to Leopold was that "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo "The Land Ethic", in ''A Sand County Almanac''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Like [[Thomas Berry]] and [[Brian Swimme]], ecological philosopher [[Freya Mathews]]&lt;ref&gt;Mattews, Freya (1991) ''The Ecological Self'' (Routledge)&lt;/ref&gt; argues that in considering the ecological self, we need to look beyond the present to the ''"[[deep time]]"'' of ages past, in the evolution of life and the creation of the cosmos, in order to consider the real roots of human consciousness.  Experiential deep ecologist [[Joanna Macy]] speaks of the Ecological Self in her book "World as Lover, World as Self",&lt;ref&gt;Macy, Joanna (2005), "World as Lover, World as Self" (Parallax Press)&lt;/ref&gt; and uses the concept in her work on "Deep Time".&lt;ref&gt;Joanna R. Macy, Molly Young Brown (1998), "Coming Back to Life : Practices to Reconnect Our Lives, Our World"; New Society Publishers (1998); {{ISBN|0-86571-391-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference between animal cognition and animal emotion is recognized by ethicists. Animal cognition covers all aspects related to the thought processes in animals.

== Scientific evidence ==

A study funded by the BBSRC and published in 2011&lt;ref name="EdgarLowe2011" /&gt; was the first to demonstrate that chickens possess empathy and the first study to use both behavioral and physiological methods to measure these traits in birds.&lt;ref name=BristolPR/&gt; Chicks were exposed to a puff of air, which they find mildly distressing. During the exposure, their mother's behaviour and physiological responses were monitored non-invasively. The hens altered their behaviour by decreased preening, increased alertness, and an increased numbers of vocalisations directed to their chicks — behaviours interpreted as a demonstration of concern. Furthermore, the hens' heart rate increased and eye temperature decreased.&lt;ref name=5m2011&gt;{{cite web | title = Foundations of empathy found in chicken |publisher=5m Publishing; The Poultry Site| url = http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/22167/foundations-of-empathy-found-in-chicken/ |date= 10 March 2011| accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bekoff2015&gt;{{cite web | title = Empathic chickens and cooperative elephants: Emotional intelligence expands its range again | publisher=Psychology Today | url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions/201103/empathic-chickens-and-cooperative-elephants-emotional-intelligence |date=9 March 2011|first=Marc |last=Bekoff| accessdate = 2015-12-28  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other emotions==

===Fear===
Previous investigations established the indicators of an emotional response in chickens. Domestic chickens can be observed to have different states of alertness. Hens exhibit fear by increasing the time spent standing alert and increased preening. Before empathy in chickens was reported, other investigations demonstrated that hens avoid environments associated with higher preening rates and standing.&lt;ref name=5m2011/&gt;

=== Stress and empathy ===

Empathetic response by hens is preceded by the determination that hens recognize distress in their chicks. Assessing the distress of chicks and the effect of the presence of their mother has been investigated using an air puff treatment.  Each treatment chick and control were exposed to puffs of airs applied to their eyes in the presence and absence of their mothers. The responses interpreted as distress in the chicks were:

* reduced temperature of the eye of the chick
* increased ground pecking
* increased preening
* increased standing (compared to normal rates of movement)&lt;ref name="EdgarHeld2015"/&gt;

The response of the hens to the apparent distress of their chicks differed to those not exhibiting distress. When distress was recognized by a hen, her heart rate increased. This is correlated to the degree of distress exhibited by the chicks. If the hen is present, distress associated behaviours are less in the chick.  Demonstrating empathy by hens toward their chicks is accompanied by the reduction of distress in the chicks.&lt;ref name="EdgarHeld2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgar|first1=Joanne|last2=Held|first2=Suzanne|last3=Paul|first3=Elizabeth|last4=Pettersson|first4=Isabelle|last5=I'Anson Price|first5=Robbie|last6=Nicol|first6=Christine|title=Social buffering in a bird|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=105|year=2015|pages=11–19|issn=0003-3472|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2015.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The specific emotional attribute of empathy in chickens has not been only investigated in terms of its existence but it has applications that have resulted in the designed reduction of stress in farm-raised poultry.&lt;ref name=5m2011/&gt;

At one time, a Virginia prison was planned to be transformed into 'Chicken empathy museum' by PETA to raise awareness of the emotional, empathetic nature of chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PETA wants to rent a Virginia prison building and turn it into a chicken empathy museum | url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/09/peta-wants-to-rent-virginia-prison-building-and-turn-it-into-a-chicken-empathy-museum.html | accessdate = 2015-06-19 |date= 15 September 2009 | publisher = [[LA Times]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nation's First Chicken Empathy Museum |date= 17 September 2009 |publisher= NYTimes |url= http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA207942701&amp;sid=summon&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=upitt_main&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=1ed1bbbd2a9156231feff8bfa2c8d926 |access-date= 30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Animal-rights group wants to open "chicken empathy" museum |publisher= The Seattle Times |date=9 September 2009| url = http://www.seattletimes.com/life/travel/animal-rights-group-wants-to-open-chicken-empathy-museum/| accessdate = 2015-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = PETA wants Jindal to turn bankrupt poultry plant into 'Chicken Empathy Museum' |publisher=NOLA.com| url = http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/03/baton_rouge_chickens_have.html |date= 12 March 2009| accessdate = 2015-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other opinions==

The acceptance of empathy in chickens is not universal and others have found no evidence for emotional empathy in chickens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Edgar J.L., Paul, E.S., Harris, L., Penturn, S. &amp; Nicol, C.J.|year=2012|title=No evidence for emotional empathy in chickens observing familiar adult conspecifics|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=2|page=e31542|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031542|pmid=22348100|pmc=3278448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFMD provides a forum for networking in [[management development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development|url=http://10times.com/organizers/european-foundation-for-management-development-efmd|journal=http://10times.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFMD operates the '''EFMD Quality Improvement System''' ([[EFMD Quality Improvement System|EQUIS]]), which is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. It is comparable to its American equivalent [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]] and provides a forum for information, research, networking and debate on innovation and best practice in management development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Hayleys case study by INSEAD wins top award in Europe |location=Sri Lanka |newspaper=[[The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka)|The Daily Mirror]] |date=3 June 2010 |url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/print/index.php/business/127-local/12150.html |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation also runs the EPAS accreditation system for programmes as well as the EFMD Deans Across Frontiers development programme (EDAF) and the Business School Impact System (BSIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD)|url=http://www.unprme.org/about-prme/governance/efmd.php|journal=http://www.unprme.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Types of accreditation ==

While the [[EQUIS]] accreditation process, which is valid for an entire school (or faculty), is the main type of accreditation EFMD offers, there are a variety of other accreditations available. With EPAS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= EPAS Accreditation EFMD Programme accreditation System (EPAS) |url=http://www.efmd.org/index.php/services-for-business-schools/epas-accreditation |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible for business schools to have certain degree programs accredited rather than the entire school. This variant somewhat resembles the AMBA ([[Association of MBAs]]) accreditation, as the London-based Association accredits the school's entire portfolio of [[MBA]] programs, but does not accredit the entire business school. EFMD also offers an accreditation for online courses (EOCCS) and for corporate learning (CLIP).

== Triple Accreditation ==

In business and management education, acquiring multiple accreditation by [[EQUIS]], [[AACSB]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]] is often considered the "gold standard" because a business school must go to through a rigorous certification process by each of the three accreditation bodies. Schools that acquire all three are often referred to as having a [[Triple accreditation]] or Triple Crown accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Grandes écoles: les labels enfin décryptés|url=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/info/labels-accreditations-grandes-ecoles-enfin-decryptes.html|journal=http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr|date = 13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EFMD activities ==

EFMD is the European partner in the [[China Europe International Business School]] ([[CEIBS]]), a joint venture with [[Shanghai Jiaotong University]] established as the first international business school with autonomous status in 1994 under an agreement between the [[European Commission]] and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
EFMD is also founding partner of the Global Foundation for Management Education (GFME), which is a joint venture with the US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business ([[AACSB]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Global Initiatives |url=http://www.efmd.org/images/stories/efmd/downloadables/EFMD_About_EFMD_Update_2011_ONLINE.pdf |accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; EFMD organizes conferences and seminars around the world for management development industry and published the [http://globalfocusmagazine.com Global Focus magazine].

In 2009, EFMD received an EU grant worth €2.2m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= 2009 Annual Action Programme for Non-State Actors and Local Authorities in Development |url=http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/documents/aap/2009/af_aap_2009_dci-nsa_p2.pdf |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a project that aims to improve the efficiency of Cuban companies by providing training to senior managers.

[[Image:globec logo.jpg|150px|right|]]
'''Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics''' (GLOBEC) is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP) core project responsible for understanding how global change will affect the abundance, diversity and productivity of marine populations. The programme was initiated by [[Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research|SCOR]] and the IOC of [[UNESCO]] in 1991, to understand how global change will affect the abundance, [[biodiversity|diversity]] and productivity of marine populations comprising a major component of [[oceanic ecosystem]]s.

The aim of GLOBEC is to advance our understanding of the structure and functioning of the global ocean ecosystem, its major subsystems, and its response to physical forcing so that a capability can be developed to forecast the responses of the marine ecosystem to global change.

==Structure==
GLOBEC encompasses an integrated suite of research activities consisting of Regional Programmes, National Activities and cross-cutting research focal activities. The GLOBEC programme has been developed by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and is co-ordinated through the GLOBEC International Project Office (IPO).

Genetic recombination caused by human activity has been occurring since around 12,000 BC, when humans first began to [[Domestication|domesticate]] organisms. [[Genetic engineering]] as the direct transfer of [[DNA]] from one organism to another was first accomplished by [[Herbert Boyer]] and [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] in 1972. It was the result of a series of advancements in techniques that allowed the direct modification of the [[genome]]. Important advances included the discovery of [[Restriction enzyme|restriction enzymes]] and [[DNA ligase|DNA ligases]], the ability to design [[Plasmid|plasmids]] and technologies like [[polymerase chain reaction]] and [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]]. [[Transformation (genetics)|Transformation]] of the DNA into a host organism was accomplished with the invention of [[biolistics]], [[Agrobacterium#Uses in biotechnology|''Agrobacterium''-mediated recombination]] and [[microinjection]].

The first [[genetically modified animal]] was a [[Genetically modified mouse|mouse]] created in 1974 by [[Rudolf Jaenisch]]. In 1976 the technology was commercialised, with the advent of [[genetically modified bacteria]] that produced [[somatostatin]], followed by [[insulin]] in 1978. In 1983 an antibiotic resistant gene was inserted into tobacco, leading to the first [[Genetically modified plant|genetically engineered plant]]. Advances followed that allowed scientists to manipulate and add genes to a variety of different organisms and induce a range of different effects. Plants were first commercialized with virus resistant tobacco released in China in 1992. The first [[genetically modified food]] was the [[Flavr Savr]] tomato marketed in 1994. By 2010, 29 countries had planted commercialized biotech crops. In 2000 a paper published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] introduced [[golden rice]], the first food developed with increased nutrient value.

The first evidence of plant domestication comes from [[emmer]] and [[einkorn wheat]] found in [[pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] villages in Southwest Asia dated about 10,500 to 10,100 BC.{{sfn|Zohary||Hopf|Weiss|p=1}}  The [[Fertile Crescent]] of Western Asia, [[Ancient Egyptian Agriculture|Egypt]], and [[History of agriculture in the Indian subcontinent|India]] were sites of the earliest planned sowing and harvesting of plants that had previously been gathered in the wild. Independent development of agriculture occurred in northern and southern China, Africa's [[Sahel]], [[New Guinea]] and several regions of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/science/25creature.html?_r=1 the history of maize cultivation in southern Mexico dates back 9000 years.] ''New York Times'', (2010-05-25)&lt;/ref&gt; The eight [[Neolithic founder crops]] ([[emmer wheat]], [[einkorn wheat]], [[barley]], [[peas]], [[lentils]], [[Vicia ervilia|bitter vetch]], [[chick pea]]s and [[flax]]) had all appeared by about 7000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins and Spread of Domestic Plants in Southwest Asia and Europe|author1=Colledge, Sue |author2=Conolly, James|isbn=1598749889 |page=40|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Horticulture]] first appears in the [[Levant]] during the [[Chalcolithic]] period about 6 800 to 6,300 BC.{{sfn|Zohary||Hopf|Weiss|p=5}} Due to the soft tissues, archeological evidence for early vegetables is scarce. The earliest vegetable remains have been found in Egyptian caves that date back to the [[2nd millennium BC]].{{sfn|Zohary||Hopf|Weiss|p=6}}

[[Selective breeding]] of domesticated plants was once the main way early farmers shaped organisms to suit their needs. [[Charles Darwin]] described three types of selection: methodical selection, wherein humans deliberately select for particular characteristics; unconscious selection, wherein a characteristic is selected simply because it is desirable; and [[natural selection]], wherein a trait that helps an organism survive better is passed on.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury&gt;
Kingsbury, Noel (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dGSj-CFxk-QC Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding]. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226437051}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}  Early breeding relied on unconscious and natural selection. The introduction of methodical selection is unknown.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|25}} Common characteristics that were bred into domesticated plants include grains that did not shatter to allow easier harvesting, uniform ripening, shorter lifespans that translate to faster growing, loss of toxic compounds, and productivity.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|27–30}} Some plants, like the Banana, were able to be propagated by [[vegetative cloning]]. Offspring often did not contain seeds, and therefore sterile. However, these offspring were usually juicier and larger. Propagation through cloning allows these mutant varieties to be cultivated despite their lack of seeds.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Hybridization was another way that rapid changes in plant's makeup were introduced. It often increased vigor in plants, and combined desirable traits together. Hybridization most likely first occurred when humans first grew similar, yet slightly different plants in close proximity.&lt;ref name=Kingsbury/&gt;{{rp|32}} [[Triticum aestivum]], wheat used in baking bread, is an [[allopolyploid]]. Its creation is the result of two separate hybridization events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheatbp.net/WheatBP/Documents/DOC_Evolution.php|title=Evolution of Wheatpublisher=Wheat, the big picture|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128092033/http://www.wheatbp.net/WheatBP/Documents/DOC_Evolution.php|archivedate=2013-01-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grafting]] can transfer [[chloroplast]]s (specialised DNA in plants that can conduct [[photosynthesis]]), [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitichondrial DNA]] and the entire [[cell nucleus]] containing the [[genome]] to potentially make a new species making grafting a form of natural genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2079813-farmers-may-have-been-accidentally-making-gmos-for-millennia/|title=Farmers may have been accidentally making GMOs for millennia|last=Le Page|first=Michael|date=2016-03-17|website=|publisher=The New Scientist|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

X-rays were first used to deliberately mutate plants in 1927. Between 1927 and 2007, more than 2,540 genetically mutated plant varieties had been produced using x-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schouten | first1 = H.

==Genetics==
{{Main|History of genetics}}
[[File:Griffith experiment.svg|thumb|300px|right|[[Griffith's experiment|Griffith]] proved the existence of a "transforming principle", which [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Avery, MacLeod and McCarty]] later showed to be [[DNA]]]]
[[File:Agrobacterium-tumefaciens.png|thumb|right|The bacterium ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' inserts [[T-DNA]] into infected plant cells, which is then incorporated into the plants [[genome]].]]Various genetic discoveries have been essential in the development of genetic engineering. [[Mendelian inheritance|Genetic inheritance]] was first discovered by [[Gregor Mendel]] in 1865 following experiments crossing peas. Although largely ignored for 34 years he provided the first evidence of hereditary segregation and independent assortment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Genetics|year=1992|volume=131|issue=2|pages=245–25|title=What Did Gregor Mendel Think He Discovered?|author1=Hartl, D. L. |author2=Orel, V. |pmc=1205000|pmid=1644269}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 [[Hugo de Vries]] came up with the name "(pan)gene" after postulating that particles are responsible for inheritance of characteristics&lt;ref name="pangen"&gt;Vries, H. de (1889) ''Intracellular Pangenesis'' [http://www.esp.org/books/devries/pangenesis/facsimile/] ("pan-gene" definition on page 7 and 40 of this 1910 translation in English)&lt;/ref&gt; and the term "genetics" was coined by [[William Bateson]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm|title=The Bateson Lecture|author=Creative Sponge|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013020831/http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm|archivedate=2007-10-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 [[Frederick Griffith]] [[Griffith's experiment|proved]] the existence of a "transforming principle" involved in inheritance, which [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|Avery, MacLeod and McCarty]] later (1944) identified as [[DNA]]. [[Edward Lawrie Tatum]] and [[George Wells Beadle]] developed the [[central dogma of genetics|central dogma]] that genes code for proteins in 1941. The [[double helix]] structure of DNA was identified by [[James D. Watson|James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] in 1953.

As well as discovering how DNA works, tools had to be developed that allowed it to be manipulated. In 1970 [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith's]] lab discovered [[restriction enzymes]] that allowed DNA to be cut at specific places and separated out on an [[electrophoresis gel]]. This enabled scientists to isolate genes from an organism's genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = R.

[[Plasmid]]s, discovered in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 13003535| year = 1952| author1 = Lederberg| first1 = J| title = Cell genetics and hereditary symbiosis| journal = Physiological Reviews| volume = 32| issue = 4| pages = 403–30| doi = 10.1152/physrev.1952.32.4.403}}&lt;/ref&gt; became important [[Vector (molecular biology)|tools]] for transferring information between cells and [[molecular cloning|replicating]] DNA sequences. [[Frederick Sanger]] developed a method for sequencing DNA in 1977, greatly increasing the genetic information available to researchers. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, allowed small sections of DNA to be amplified and aided identification and isolation of genetic material.

As well as manipulating the DNA, techniques had to be developed for its insertion (known as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]) into an organism's genome. Griffiths experiment had already shown that some bacteria had [[natural competence|the ability to naturally take up and express foreign DNA]]. Artificial competence was induced in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' in 1970 when [[Morton Mandel]] and [[Akiko Higa]] showed that it could take up [[Lambda phage|bacteriophage λ]] after treatment with calcium chloride solution (CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(70)90051-3 |title = Calcium-dependent bacteriophage DNA infection | last = Mandel | first = Morton |author2=Higa, Akiko  | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | year= 1970| volume = 53 |issue = 1 |pages = 15962|pmid = 4922220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Stanley Cohen showed that CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatment was also effective for uptake of plasmid DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.8.2110| title = Non chromosomal Antibiotic Resistance in Bacteria: Genetic Transformation of Escherichia coli by R-Factor DNA| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 69| issue = 8| pages = 2110–14| year = 1972| last1 = Cohen | first1 = S.

He combined DNA from the  monkey virus [[SV40]] with that of the [[Lambda phage|lambda virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.69.10.2904| title = Biochemical Method for Inserting New Genetic Information into DNA of Simian Virus 40: Circular SV40 DNA Molecules Containing Lambda Phage Genes and the Galactose Operon of Escherichia coli| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 69| issue = 10| pages = 2904–09| year = 1972| last1 = Jackson | first1 = D.

Cohen was researching plasmids, while Boyers work involved restriction enzymes. They recognised the complementary nature of their work and teamed up in 1972. Together they found a restriction enzyme that cut the [[pSC101]] plasmid at a single point and were able to insert and ligate a gene that conferred resistance to the [[kanamycin]] antibiotic into the gap. Cohen had previously devised a method where bacteria could be induced to take up a plasmid and using this they were able to create a bacteria that survived in the presence of the kanamycin. This represented the first genetically modified organism. They repeated experiments showing that other genes could be expressed in bacteria, including one from the toad [[Xenopus laevis]], the first cross kingdom transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1973_Boyer.php|title=Genome and genetics timeline – 1973|publisher=Genome news network}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Genetics: Genetic Engineering Timeline|last=Arnold|first=Paul|year=2009|url=http://www.brighthub.com/science/genetics/articles/21983.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Cohen, Stanley N. |author2=Chang, Annie C.

==Regulation==
{{Main|Regulation of genetic engineering}}
The development of genetic engineering technology led to concerns in the scientific community about potential risks. The development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975, at [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], California. The [[Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA|Asilomar meeting]] recommended a set of guidelines regarding the cautious use of recombinant technology and any products resulting from that technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.72.6.1981| title = Summary statement of the Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA molecules| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 72| issue = 6| pages = 1981–84| year = 1975| last1 = Berg | first1 = P.| last2 = Baltimore | first2 = D.| last3 = Brenner | first3 = S.| last4 = Roblin | first4 = R.

In 1982 the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) released a report into the potential hazards of releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment as the first transgenic plants were being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bull, A.T., Holt, G. and Lilly, M.D.|year=1982|title=Biotechnology : international trends and perspectives|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|location=Paris|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/34/9/2097562.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the technology improved and genetically organisms moved from [[model organism]]s to potential commercial products the USA established a committee at the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy|Office of Science and Technology]] (OSTP) to develop mechanisms to regulate the developing technology.&lt;ref name="McHughen2007"/&gt; In 1986 the OSTP assigned regulatory approval of genetically modified plants in the US to the USDA, FDA and EPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The European Union first introduced laws requiring GMO's to be labelled in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mandatory Labeling of Genetically Modified Foods: Does it Really Provide Consumer Choice?|url = http://www.agbioforum.org/v6n12/v6n12a13-carter.htm|website = www.agbioforum.org|date = 2003-12-15|access-date = 2016-01-21|first = Colin A.

In 2010 scientists at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] announced that they had created the first synthetic bacterial [[genome]]. The researchers added the new genome to bacterial cells and selected for cells that contained the new genome. To do this the cells undergoes a process called resolution, where during bacterial cell division one new cell receives the original DNA genome of the bacteria, whilst the other receives the new synthetic genome. When this cell replicates it uses the synthetic genome as its template.

In 2014 a bacteria was developed that replicated a [[plasmid]] containing an unnatural [[base pair]]. This required altering the bacterium so it could import the unnatural [[nucleotides]] and then efficiently replicate them. The plasmid retained the unnatural base pairs when it doubled an estimated 99.4% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2015 [[CRISPR]] and [[TALENs]] was used to modify plant genomes. Chinese labs used it to create a fungus-resistant wheat and boost rice yields, while a U.K. group used it to tweak a barley gene that could help produce drought-resistant varieties. When used to precisely remove material from DNA without adding genes from other species, the result is not subject the lengthy and expensive regulatory process associated with GMOs. While CRISPR may use foreign DNA to aid the editing process, the second generation of edited plants contain none of that DNA. Researchers celebrated the acceleration because it may allow them to "keep up" with rapidly evolving pathogens. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stated that some examples of gene-edited corn, potatoes and soybeans are not subject to existing regulations. As of 2016 other review bodies had yet to make statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600765/10-breakthrough-technologies-2016-precise-gene-editing-in-plants/|title=10 Breakthrough Technologies 2016: Precise Gene Editing in Plants|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-03-08 |date=March 2016 |first=David |last=Talbot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="957">'''Home entertainment server''' systems differ from traditional [[Home theater PC|media center]] systems in that they designed from inception for storage, management and sharing of entertainment content, much as a [[file server]] is mission designed to share traditional computer files.  These systems are optimized for entertainment file sharing allowing libraries to be accessed across multiple servers from multiple rooms. They also integrate a range of content acquisition facilities including shared networking, built-in optical drives and tuners. These systems are operated from a simple TV-based menu. Individual servers feature secure volume managed expandable storage including internal, and external drives and arrays of drives into the multi-[[terabyte]] range.

The [[Telly (home entertainment server)]] is an example of such a device.

They also include the [[MADS-box]]-containing genes involved in the [[ABC model of flower development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Theissen G |title=Development of floral organ identity: stories from the MADS house |journal=Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=75–85 |year=2001 |pmid=11163172 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1369-5266(00)00139-4 |doi=10.1016/S1369-5266(00)00139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides flower-producing plants, the MADS-box motif is also present in other organisms such as insects, yeasts, and mammals. They have various functions depending on the organism including flower development, proto-oncogene transcription, and gene regulation in specific cells (such as muscle cells).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shore P, Sharrocks AD |title=The MADS-box family of transcription factors|journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |volume=229 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |year=1995|pmid=7744019 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0001l.x/abstract |doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1995.0001l.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the terms being commonly interchanged, not all homeotic genes are Hox genes; the MADS-box genes are homeotic but not Hox genes. Thus, the Hox genes are a subset of homeotic genes.

[[File:Homeotic selector gene complexes.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Homeotic selector gene complexes in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'']]

One of the most commonly studied [[model organism]]s in regards to homeotic genes is the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. Its homeotic genes occur in either the Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) or the Bithorax complex (BX-C) discovered by [[Edward B. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heuer JG, Kaufman TC |title=Homeotic genes have specific functional roles in the establishment of the ''Drosophila'' embryonic peripheral nervous system |journal=Development |volume=115 |pages=35–47 |date=May 1992|pmid=1353440 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/115/1/35.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the complexes focuses on a different area of development. The [[antennapedia]] complex consists of five genes, including [[Proboscipedia (pb gene)|proboscipedia]], and is involved in the development of the front of the embryo, forming the segments of the head and thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Randazzo FM, Cribbs DL, Kaufman TC |title=Rescue and regulation of proboscipedia: a homeotic gene of the Antennapedia Complex |journal=Development |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=257–71|date=Sep 1991|pmid=1684932 |url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/113/1/257.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bithorax complex consists of three main genes and is involved in the development of the back of the embryo, namely the abdomen and the posterior segments of the thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maeda RK, Karch F |title=The ABC of the BX-C: the bithorax complex explained|journal=Development|volume=133|issue= 8|pages=1413–22|date=Apr 2006|pmid=16556913|doi=10.1242/dev.02323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During development (starting at the [[blastoderm]] stage of the embryo), these genes are constantly expressed to assign structures and roles to the different segments of the fly's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Breen TR, Harte PJ |title=''trithorax'' regulates multiple homeotic genes in the bithorax and Antennapedia complexes and exerts different tissue-specific, parasegment-specific and promoter-specific effects on each |journal=Development|volume=117|pages=119–34|date=January 1993 |pmid=7900984|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/117/1/119.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Drosophila'', these genes can be analyzed using the [http://flybase.org/ Flybase] database.

== Research ==
Much research has been done on homeotic genes in different organisms, ranging from basic understanding of how the molecules work to mutations to how homeotic genes affect the human body. Changing the expression levels of homeotic genes can negatively impact the organism. For example, in one study, a pathogenic phytoplasma caused homeotic genes in a flowering plant to either be significantly upregulated or downregulated. This led to severe phenotypic changes including dwarfing, defects in the pistils, hypopigmentation, and the development of leaf-like structures on most floral organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Himeno M, Neriya Y, et al |title=Unique morphological changes in plant pathogenic phytoplasma-infected petunia flowers are related to transcriptional regulation of floral homeotic genes in an organ-specific manner |journal=The Plant Journal |volume=67 |pages=971–79 |date=July 1, 2011 |pmid=21605209 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04650.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, it was found that the homeotic gene ''[[Cdx2]]'' acts as a [[tumor suppressor]]. In normal expression levels, the gene prevents tumorgenesis and colorectal cancer when exposed to [[carcinogen]]s; however, when ''Cdx2'' was not well expressed, carcinogens caused tumor development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bonhomme C, Duluc I, etal |title=The ''Cdx2'' homeobox gene has a tumour suppressor function in the distal colon in addition to a homeotic role during gut development |journal=Gut|volume=52|pages=1465–71|date=October 2003|pmid=12970140|url=http://gut.bmj.com/content/52/10/1465.long|doi=10.1136/gut.52.10.1465 |pmc=1773830}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, along with many others, show the importance of homeotic genes even after development.

The observation that the trophic structures (i.e. [[mouth]]s) of [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]] congeneric species generally vary by a factor of ~1.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eadie|first1=John|last2=Broekhoven|first2=Louis|title=Size Ratios and Artifacts: Hutchinson's Rule Revisited|date=January 1987|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=129|issue=1|pages=1–17|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2461961?uid=24652&amp;uid=3739736&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=67&amp;uid=24651&amp;uid=62&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21106566554603|doi=10.1086/284619}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This variation presumably leads to [[niche differentiation]], allowing coexistence of multiple similar species in the same [[habitat]], by partitioning food resources. The rule's legitimacy has been questioned, as other categories of objects also exhibit size ratios of roughly 1.3.

The '''Institut für Meereskunde''' (IfM, Institute of Marine Sciences) in Kiel, Germany, existed from April 1, 1937 to January 1, 2004. It was an essential element of the long history of marine sciences in Kiel. This history started with the work of [[:de:Samuel Reyher|Samuel Reyher]] published in 1697 and is today continued within the [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="HW15e" /&gt;

==Early history==

Early work in physical/chemical oceanography started with Samuel Reyher, professor at the ''Christian Albrecht [University of Kiel]'' (CAU), when he published his investigation on salinity in the ice-covered Kiel Fjord in 1697.&lt;ref group="p" name="Rey97e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kor94e" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mat10"&gt;Wolfgang Matthäus: “Germany and the investigation of the Baltic Sea hydrography during the 19th and early 20th century. In: “Meereswissenschaftliche Berichte”, Warnemünde 2010, 83, S. 1 - 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Other professors of Kiel University followed with work on marine topics. [[:de:Johann Nikolaus Tetens|Johann Nikolaus Tetens]] (1736-1807) studied tides of the North Sea,&lt;ref group="p" name="KortPaffen79e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="PaffenKort84e" /&gt; [[:de:Christoph Heinrich Pfaff|Christoph Heinrich Pfaff]] (1773-1852) studied hydrographic and chemical conditions in the western Baltic Sea,&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Pfaff" /&gt; and [[:de:Gustav Adolf Michaelis|Gustav Adolf Michaelis]] (1798-1848) discussed optical effects in the sea.&lt;ref name="Micha"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=BFcHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=gustav+adolf+michaelis+kiel+meer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iZXhwtJRfH&amp;sig=Z0SiNCZnOQ0wpXGihBSt1Suj3a4&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj19oHBopLbAhVMJlAKHRoiByAQ6AEIZjAM#v=onepage&amp;q=gustav%20adolf%20michaelis%20kiel%20meer&amp;f=false |title=Ueber das Leuchten der Ostsee nach eigenen Beobachtungen |accessdate=May 21, 2018 | language=German | trans-title=On the shining of the Baltic Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic marine research, however, began only later during the 19th century with biological studies, most notably by the zoologist [[:de:Karl August Möbius|Karl August Möbius]] (1825-1908), the physiologist [[Victor Hensen]] (1835-1924), the marine production biologist [[Karl Brandt]] (1854-1931), and the zoologist [[:de:Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn|Wilhelm Friedrich Georg Behn]] (1808-1878) who participated in the first of the Danish [[Galathea expeditions]] (1845-1847). The [[:de:Plankton-Expedition|Plankton-Expedition]] in the Atlantic Ocean on the ’’National’’ in 1889 was the beginning of deep-sea expeditions carried out by Kiel scientists.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;

Systematic physical and chemical marine studies also started during the second half of the 19th century. Two people need to be acknowledged in particular. The merchant and industrialist [[:de:Heinrich Adolph Meyer|Heinrich Adolph Meyer]] (1822-1889) from Hamburg managed to  convene a group united by marine research interests. The physicist [[Gustav Karsten]] (1820-1900) from Kiel belonged to this group. A long-term cooperation developed among these two people. Beginning in 1859, Meyer carried out first hydrographic observations in Kiel Fjord and started systematic measurements for the investigation of seasonal changes in the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mat10" /&gt; Meyer received his honorary doctor from Kiel University in 1866.

A major step was the establishment of the “Prussian Commission for the Scientific Investigation of German Seas in Kiel“ (also called the ''Kiel Commission''; in German: ''Preußische Kommission zur wissenschaftlichen Untersuchung der deutschen Meere in Kiel''). Meyer was a founding member and held the first chair until 1880, with Karsten being his successor until 1896. Möbius and Hensen were also members of the commission. The main objective was the improvement of fisheries. But it became evident soon that this goal could not be reached without an improved knowledge of the hydrography and the development of new approaches and methods. Subsequently the Kiel Commission played an important role in the development of marine sciences in Gemany.&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="KoCu1902" /&gt; A "Laboratory for international marine science" (in German: "Laboratorium für die internationale Meeresforschung") was established by the Commission in 1902. Furthermore, the geographer [[Otto Krümmel]] became professor at Kiel University in 1883,&lt;ref group="p" name="Ko05e"/&gt; strengthening hydrographic work. He wrote the first textbook (2 volumes) on oceanography in German language.&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr07e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Kr11e" /&gt; The Institute of Zoology and [[Zoological Museum of Kiel University]] became the center of marine biological research, led by [[:de:Adolf Remane|Adolf Remane]] (1898-1976) from 1924 to 1934. In addition, Kiel was the home of outstanding scientists and engineers in marine acoustics as part of industry and navy, in particular [[Alexander Behm]] (1880-1952), Hugo Lichte (1891-1963)&lt;ref group="Einzel" name="Lichte1919" /&gt; and [[:de:Karl Heinrich Hecht|Karl Heinrich Hecht]] (1880-1961).

==Institut für Meereskunde==

The University of Kiel decided to concentrate marine sciences within an institution of the university, and the ''Institut für Meereskunde'' (IfM) was founded in 1937.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ge00e" /&gt; Activities of the former laboratories of the Kiel Commission were included in the new institution. The institute had three departments: Biology, Hydrography and Chemistry, and Geology. In addition to disciplinary work, interdisciplinary approaches took root. Studies in the Baltic Sea were supposed to be in the focus, but not exclusively. A building in Kitzeberg on the eastern shore of Kiel Fjord was provided. Remane was director of the IfM from 1937 to 1944. The marine chemist [[:de:Hermann Wattenberg|Hermann Wattenberg]] (1901-1944) became his successor on May 1, 1944. He perished shortly after the appointment on July 24, 1944, together with eight other members of the institute, when bombs destroyed the institute’s building during World War II.

After the end of the war in 1945, work at the IfM already started again in 1946.&lt;ref name="KoCu1946"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanrep.geomar.de/22468/1/1946-1972.pdf |title=Meeresforschung in Kiel 1946-1972|accessdate=May 21, 2018 |language=German | trans-title=Marine research in Kiel 1946-1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Georg Wüst]] (1890-1977) became Professor of Oceanography and Meteorology at the CAU and Director of the IfM. He had been a scientific leader at the former Institute and Museum of Marine Sciences at Berlin University (in German: “Institut und [[:de:Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)|Museum für Meereskunde (Berlin)]]“ &lt;ref group="p" name="Kor87e" /&gt; and had mostly performed research on the circulation of water masses in the global ocean and in particular in the deep Atlantic. In Kiel he succeeded in retrieving several earlier members of the institute, getting the permission to use an old villa on the western shore of Kiel as an institute’s building, obtaining the research cutter “Südfall“ and restarting educational programs.&lt;ref name="Erdk51"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25635619 | title=Der Wiederaufbau der deutschen ozeanographischen Forschung nach dem Zusammenbruch im Urteil des Auslandes | language=German | trans-title=The rebuilding of German oceanographic research after the downfall in the judgement of foreign countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; He began research work in the Baltic Sea with a total staff of 15.

After Wüst’s retirement [[Günter Dietrich]] (1911-1972) became his successor. He had been a student at the University of Berlin and had also studied the circulation of water masses in the Atlantic Ocean with Georg Wüst and [[Albert Defant]] at the former Berlin institute. Wüst’s and Dietrich’s experience in deep ocean studies strengthened the orientation of the IfM work towards the open and deep ocean, in particular in physical and chemical oceanography. The IfM became the leading marine research institution in West Germany during those years,&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kr87e"&gt;Wolfgang Krauss: ''Günter Dietrichs Kieler Jahre (1959 - 1972).''[“Günter Dietrich’s years in Kiel (1959 - 1972)“] In: '' Christiana Albertina.'' Neumünster 1987, 24 N.F. S. 43-54.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying on the scientific legacy of the former Berlin institute in research&lt;ref group="p" name="Wue56e" /&gt; and education.&lt;ref group="p" name="Mc64" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di57e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di75e" /&gt;&lt;ref group="p" name="Di80" /&gt; Technically, the successor of the earlier Museum of Marine Sciences in Berlin today is the [[German Museum of Technology]] in Berlin.

An important milestone in the IfM’s development was the commission of the new research vessel [[:de:Meteor (Schiff, 1964)|Meteor (Schiff, 1964)]], operated jointly by the German Hydrographic Office (see [[Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany]]) and the German Research Foundation (see [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]. The ship was used by all interested research groups in Germany. The first major expedition 1964/65 to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean was part of the ''International Indian Ocean Expedition''.&lt;ref name="scorIIOE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iioe-2.incois.gov.in/IIOE-2/iioe.jsp |title=About International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE) |accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German contribution was led by [[Günter Dietrich]] and [[:de:Eugen Seibold|Eugen Seibold]], both from Kiel University, and the majority of scientists and technicians were based in Kiel.&lt;ref group="p" name="Di66e" /&gt; This expedition was the restart of deep-sea oceanography in Kiel.

The financial needs of the IfM were increasing with its tasks and number of personnel, having increased to 124 in the year 1968.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI68e" /&gt; In order to obtain additional funding from the federal and other state governments, the IfM joined the group of “blue list” research institutions (see [[Leibniz Association]] in 1968. New statutes introduced a collegial system, with the acting director being elected for two-year terms by a panel composed of department heads and employee representatives. Although the funding was no longer related to the university budget, strong ties to the CAU prevailed. Professors were selected jointly by the IfM and the CAU.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ad92e" /&gt;

During the following years the IfM became partner in a considerable number of international research programs.&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt; A relevant number of IfM scientists worked at foreign research institutions for extended time periods, primarily in the USA. Later a large number of foreign investigators joined the IfM as visiting scientists. The number of employees was increasing steadily.

In the meantime marine geology and geophysics groups had developed parallel to the IfM groups at the CAU. Parts of these activities were combined in the new geoscience institute “Geomar” established in 1987.&lt;ref group="p" name="Th17" /&gt; At the end of 2001 Geomar had 153 members of staff.&lt;ref name="JBG02"&gt;“GEOMAR Jahresbericht/Annual Report 2001.” GEOMAR Forschungszentrum für marine Geowissenschaften der Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel 2001, 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt; The staff of the IfM had increased to 252 by that time.&lt;ref group="p" name="JBI02" /&gt; With the aim of achieving an increasing collaboration of marine disciplines in Kiel, the “IfM” and “Geomar” joined organizationally to form “IFM-GEOMAR” as part of the “Leibniz Association” on January 1, 2004. The new institution had 389 members of staff at its beginning.&lt;ref name="JBG05"&gt;Andreas Villwock (Ed.): “IFM-GEOMAR Report 2002-2004.” Leibniz-Institut für Meereswissenschaften, Kiel 2005, A-2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to fiscal considerations, IFM-GEOMAR was transferred to an institution of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]] on January 1, 2004, thus being primarily funded by the federal government. The name changed to [[GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel]].

Merian (Schiff)|Maria S. Merian (Schiff)]]).

==Participation in major research programs==

The “German Research Foundation” ([[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]) supported long-term special research programs (SFBs). IfM scientists participated in several of these SFBs, often in a leadership function:&lt;ref group="p" name="Ze17" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13198">The '''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft''' was an early private [[sexology]] research institute in Germany from 1919 to 1933. The name is variously translated as ''Institute of Sex Research'', ''Institute of Sexology'', ''Institute for Sexology'' or ''Institute for the Science of Sexuality''. The Institute was a non-profit foundation situated in [[Tiergarten, Berlin]]. It was headed by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. Since 1897 he had run the ''[[Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee]]'' ("Scientific-Humanitarian Committee"), which campaigned on conservative and rational grounds for [[gay rights]] and tolerance. The Committee published the long-running journal ''[[Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen]]''. Hirschfeld built a unique library on same-sex love and eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Oosterhuis. (Ed.) ''Homosexuality and Male Bonding in Pre-Nazi Germany: The Youth Movement, the Gay Movement, and Male Bonding Before Hitler's Rise: Original Transcripts from Der Eigene, the First Gay Journal in the World''. (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Nazi book burnings]] in Berlin included the archives of the Institute. After the Nazis gained control of Germany in the 1930s, the institute and its libraries were destroyed as part of a [[Censorship in Nazi Germany|Nazi government censorship]] program by youth brigades, who burned its books and documents in the street.&lt;ref name="Qualia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Sexology|url=http://www.qualiafolk.com/2011/12/08/institute-of-sexology/|website=qualiafolk.com|publisher=Qualia Folk|accessdate=18 January 2015|date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and purpose==
[[File:Hedwig W. and friend (ca 1922).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Herbert W. (left) was a transgender friend of Magnus Hirschfeld, and lived for two years in Berlin under his chosen name. This photo is from Hirschfeld's ''Sexual Intermediates'' (1922).]]The ''Institute of Sex Research'' was opened in 1919 by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] and his collaborator [[Arthur Kronfeld]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgipt.org/gesch/kronf/kronf_e.htm ''In Memory of Arthur Kronfeld''])&lt;/ref&gt; a once famous psychotherapist and later professor at the [[Charité]]. As well as being a research library and housing a large archive, the Institute also included medical, psychological, and ethnological divisions, and a marriage and sex counseling office. The Institute was visited by around 20,000 people each year, and conducted around 1,800 consultations. Poorer visitors were treated for free. In addition, the institute advocated [[sex education]], [[contraception]], the treatment of [[sexually transmitted diseases]], and [[feminism|women's emancipation]], and was a pioneer worldwide in the call for civil rights and social acceptance for homosexual and [[transgender]] people.

The Institute became a point of scientific and research interest for many scientists of sexuality, as well as scientific, political and social reformers in Germany and Europe, particularly from socialist, liberal and social-democratic circles. In 1923 the Institute was visited by [[Nikolai Semashko (medicine)|Nikolai Semashko]], Commissar for Health in the Soviet Union. This was followed by numerous visits and research trips by health officials, political, sexual and social reformers, and scientific researchers from the Soviet Union interested in the work of Hirschfeld.&lt;ref&gt;Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent, Dan Healey, 2001, pp.132-133&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926 a delegation from the institute, led by Hirschfeld, reciprocated with a research visit to Moscow. In 1929 Hirschfeld presided over the third international congress of the [[World League for Sexual Reform]] at [[Wigmore Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Times]], ''League For Sexual Reform International Congress Opened'', 9 September 1929;&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Transgender pioneers==
Magnus Hirschfeld coined the term [[transsexualism]],&lt;ref&gt;Ekins R., King D. (2001) ''Pioneers of Transgendering: The Popular Sexology of David O. Cauldwell.'' IJT 5,2 ([http://www.symposion.com/ijt/cauldwell/cauldwell_01.htm  text online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428021447/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/cauldwell/cauldwell_01.htm |date=2006-04-28 }})&lt;/ref&gt; identifying the clinical category which his colleague [[Harry Benjamin]] would later develop in the United States. Transgender people were on the staff of the Institute, as well as being among the clients there. Various endocrinologic and surgical services were offered, including the first modern sex reassignment surgeries in the 1930s. Hirschfeld also worked with Berlin's police department to curtail the arrest of cross-dressed individuals, including those suspected of wearing certain clothing in connection with sex work, through the creation of [[transvestite]] passes issued on behalf of the Institute to those who had a personal desire to wear clothing associated with a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aO7YCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=gay+berlin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ7az2qKHWAhVETSYKHWznCn0QuwUIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Gay Berlin: Birthplace of a Modern Identity|last=Beachy|first=Robert|date=2015|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=0307473139|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/17/371424790/between-world-wars-gay-culture-flourished-in-berlin|title=Between World Wars, Gay Culture Flourished In Berlin|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This book, and other that may have survived the destruction of the Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee and the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, are sought after by the Magnus-Hirschfeld-Gesellschaft in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://magnus-hirschfeld.de/bibliothek-und-archiv/sammlungsschwerpunkte/gesucht-und-gefunden/|title=Dinge, die wir suchen|website=magnus-hirschfeld.de|access-date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
]]In late February 1933, as the influence of [[Ernst Röhm]] weakened, the Nazi Party launched its purge of gay (then known as ''[[homophile]]'') clubs in Berlin, outlawed sex publications, and banned organised [[gay]] groups. As a consequence, many fled Germany (including, for instance, [[Erika Mann]]). In March 1933 the Institute's main administrator, [[Kurt Hiller]], was sent to a concentration camp. The buildings were later taken over by the Nazis for their own purposes. They were a bombed-out ruin by 1944, and were demolished sometime in the mid-1950s. Hirschfeld tried, in vain, to re-establish his Institute in Paris, but he died in France in 1935.

On 6 May 1933, while Hirschfeld was in [[Ascona]], Switzerland, the ''[[Deutsche Studentenschaft]]'' made an organised attack on the Institute of Sex Research. A few days later, the Institute's library and archives were publicly hauled out and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in the streets of the [[Opernplatz (Berlin)|Opernplatz]]. Around 20,000 books and journals, and 5,000 images, were destroyed. Also seized were the Institute's extensive lists of names and addresses. In the midst of the burning, [[Joseph Goebbels]] gave a political speech to a crowd of around 40,000 people. The leaders of the Deutsche Studentenschaft also proclaimed their own ''Feuersprüche'' (fire decrees). Also books by Jewish writers, and pacifists such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]], were removed from local public libraries and the [[Humboldt University]], and were burned.&lt;ref&gt;Leonidas Hill (2001). "The Nazi Attack on 'Un-German' Literature, 1933-1945" IN: ''The Holocaust and the Book: Destruction and Preservation''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many fled into exile, the radical activist [[Adolf Brand]] made a stand in Germany for five months after the book burnings, but in November 1933 he was forced to announce the formal end of the organised homosexual emancipation movement in Germany. On 28 June 1934 Hitler conducted a purge of gay men in the ranks of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] wing of the Nazis, which involved murdering them in the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. This was then followed by stricter laws on homosexuality and the round-up of gay men. The address lists seized from the Institute are believed to have aided Hitler in these actions. Many tens of thousands of arrestees found themselves, ultimately, in slave-labour or death camps. Karl Giese committed suicide in 1938 when the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia and his heir, lawyer Karl Fein, was murdered in 1942 during deportation.

==After World War II==
The charter of the institute had specified that in the event of dissolution, any assets of the Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld Foundation (which had sponsored the Institute since 1924) were to be donated to the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]. Hirschfeld also wrote a personal will while in exile in Paris, leaving any remaining assets to his students and heirs Karl Giese and Li Shiu Tong (Tao Li) for the continuation of his work. However, neither stipulation was carried out. The West German courts found that the foundation's dissolution and the seizure of property by the Nazis in 1934 was legal. The West German legislature also retained the Nazi amendments to [[Paragraph 175]], making it impossible for surviving gay men to claim restitution for the destroyed cultural center.&lt;ref&gt;James D. Steakley. ''The Early Homosexual Emancipation Movement in Germany''. (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

Li Shiu Tong lived in Switzerland and the United States until 1956, but as far as is known, he did not attempt to continue Hirschfeld's work. Some remaining fragments of data from the library were later collected by [[W. Dorr Legg]] and [[ONE, Inc.]] in the USA in the 1950s.

In 1973 a new ''Institut für Sexualwissenschaft'' was opened at the University of Frankfurt am Main (director: [[Volkmar Sigusch]]), and 1996 at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

'''Iron fertilization''' is the intentional introduction of [[iron]] to iron-poor areas of the ocean surface to stimulate [[phytoplankton]] production. This is intended to enhance [[Primary productivity|biological productivity]] and/or accelerate carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration from the atmosphere.

Iron is a [[trace element]] necessary for [[photosynthesis]] in plants. It is highly [[insoluble]] in [[sea water]] and in a variety of locations is the [[limiting nutrient]] for phytoplankton growth. Large [[algal bloom]]s can be created by supplying iron to iron-deficient ocean waters. These blooms can nourish other organisms.

Multiple ocean labs, scientists and businesses have explored fertilization. Beginning in 1993, thirteen research teams completed ocean trials demonstrating that phytoplankton blooms can be stimulated by iron augmentation.&lt;ref name="Boyd2007"&gt;{{Cite journal

Fertilization occurs naturally when [[upwelling]]s bring nutrient-rich water to the surface, as occurs when ocean currents meet an [[Bank (topography)|ocean bank]] or a [[sea mount]]. This form of fertilization produces the world's largest marine [[habitat]]s. Fertilization can also occur when weather carries [[Aeolian processes|wind blown dust]] long distances over the ocean, or iron-rich minerals are carried into the ocean by [[glacier]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Ocean fertilization | last = Smetacek | first = Victor | authorlink = Victor Smetacek | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071129123537/http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/events/past_events/ocean_fert.pdf |url = http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/events/past_events/ocean_fert.pdf|archivedate = 29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; rivers and icebergs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,599213,00.html#ref=rss |title=Cold Carbon Sink: Slowing Global Warming with Antarctic Iron - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2008-12-18 |accessdate=2012-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Consideration of iron's importance to phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis dates to the 1930s when English [[biologist]] Joseph Hart speculated that the ocean's great "desolate zones" (areas apparently rich in nutrients, but lacking in plankton activity or other sea life) might be iron-deficient.&lt;ref name="JohnMartin"/&gt; Little scientific discussion was recorded until the 1980s, when oceanographer [[John Martin (oceanographer)|John Martin]] renewed controversy on the topic with his marine water nutrient analyses. His studies supported Hart's hypothesis. These "desolate" regions came to be called "High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll" ([[HNLC]]) zones.&lt;ref name="JohnMartin"&gt;{{cite web | title=John Martin (1935-1993)| last=Weier | first=John | work=On the Shoulders of Giants | publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Martin/ | accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Gribbin was the first scientist to publicly suggest that [[climate change]] could be reduced by adding large amounts of soluble iron to the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GRIBBIN|first=JOHN|title=Any old iron?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/331570c0|journal=Nature|volume=331|issue=6157|pages=570–570|doi=10.1038/331570c0|year=1988|bibcode=1988Natur.331..570G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin's 1988 quip four months later at [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]], "Give me a half a tanker of iron and I will give you another [[ice age]]",&lt;ref name="JohnMartin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ocean Iron Fertilization – Why Dump Iron into the Ocean |work=Café Thorium |publisher=[[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] |url=http://www.whoi.edu/science/MCG/cafethorium/website/projects/iron.html |accessdate=2007-03-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210104008/http://www.whoi.edu/science/MCG/cafethorium/website/projects/iron.html |archivedate=2007-02-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; drove a decade of research.

The findings suggested that iron deficiency was limiting ocean productivity and offered an approach to mitigating climate change as well. Perhaps the most dramatic support for Martin's hypothesis came with the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in the [[Philippines]]. [[Environmental scientist]] [[Andrew Watson (scientist)|Andrew Watson]] analyzed global data from that eruption and calculated that it deposited approximately 40,000 tons of iron [[dust]] into oceans worldwide. This single fertilization event preceded an easily observed global decline in [[atmospheric]] {{chem|CO|2}} and a parallel pulsed increase in [[oxygen]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson| first= A.J.| title =Volcanic iron, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ocean productivity and climate| journal= Nature| volume= 385| pages= 587–588| date= 1997-02-13| url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v385/n6617/pdf/385587b0.pdf|format=PDF| doi=10.1038/385587b0| issue=6617|bibcode = 1997Natur.385R.587W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties to the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter|London Dumping Convention]] adopted a non-binding resolution in 2008 on fertilization (labeled LC-LP.1(2008)). The resolution states that ocean fertilization activities, other than legitimate scientific research, "should be considered as contrary to the aims of the Convention and Protocol and do not currently qualify for any exemption from the definition of dumping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.imo.org/blast/blastDataHelper.asp?data_id=24337&amp;filename=LC-LP1%2830%29.pdf|title=RESOLUTION LC-LP.1 (2008) ON THE REGULATION OF OCEAN FERTILIZATION|date=31 October 2008|publisher=London Dumping Convention|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Assessment Framework for Scientific Research Involving Ocean Fertilization, regulating the dumping of wastes at sea (labeled LC-LP.2(2010)) was adopted by the Contracting Parties to the Convention in October 2010 (LC 32/LP 5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/MediaCentre/PressBriefings/Pages/Assessment-Framework-for-scientific-research-involving-ocean-fertilization-agreed.aspx|title=Assessment Framework for scientific research involving ocean fertilization agreed|date=October 20, 2010|publisher=[[International Maritime Organization]]|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
Martin hypothesized that increasing phytoplankton photosynthesis could slow or even reverse [[global warming]] by sequestering {{chem|CO|2}} in the sea. He died shortly thereafter during preparations for Ironex I,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemoce.mlml.calstate.edu/past.htm#ironex1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040408032546/http://chemoce.mlml.calstate.edu/past.htm#ironex1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-04-08|title=Ironex (Iron Experiment) I|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a proof of concept research voyage, which was successfully carried out near the [[Galapagos Islands]] in 1993 by his colleagues at [[Moss Landing Marine Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="JohnMartin"/&gt; Thereafter 12 international ocean studies examined the phenomenon:

===Role of iron===
About 70% of the world's surface is covered in oceans. The part of these where light can penetrate is inhabited by [[algae]] (and other marine life). In some oceans, algae growth and reproduction is limited by the amount of iron. Iron is a vital micronutrient for phytoplankton growth and [[photosynthesis]] that has historically been delivered to the [[pelagic zone|pelagic sea]] by [[dust storm]]s from arid lands. This [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian dust]] contains 3–5% iron and its deposition has fallen nearly 25% in recent decades.&lt;ref name="earthobservatory.nasa.gov"&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NasaNews/2003/2003091615946.html Ocean Plant Life Slows Down and Absorbs less Carbon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802201630/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NasaNews/2003/2003091615946.html |date=2007-08-02 }} NASA Earth Observatory&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Redfield ratio]] describes the relative atomic concentrations of critical nutrients in plankton biomass and is conventionally written "106 C: 16 N: 1 P." This expresses the fact that one atom of [[phosphorus]] and 16 of [[nitrogen]] are required to "[[Carbon fixation|fix]]" 106 carbon atoms (or 106 molecules of {{chem|CO|2}}). Research expanded this constant to "106 C: 16 N: 1 P: .001 Fe" signifying that in iron deficient conditions each atom of iron can fix 106,000 atoms of carbon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sunda, W. G. |author2=S. A. Huntsman |title=Iron uptake and growth limitation in oceanic and coastal phytoplankton |journal=Mar.

The 2004 EIFEX experiment reported a carbon dioxide to iron export ratio of nearly 3000 to 1.  The atomic ratio would be approximately: "3000 C: 58,000 N: 3,600 P: 1 Fe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de Baar H . J. W., Gerringa, L. J. A., Laan, P., Timmermans, K.

Therefore, small amounts of iron (measured by mass parts per trillion) in HNLC zones can trigger large phytoplankton blooms on the order of 100,000 kilograms of plankton per kilogram of iron . The size of the iron particles is critical. Particles of 0.5–1 micrometer or less seem to be ideal both in terms of sink rate and bioavailability. Particles this small are easier for [[cyanobacteria]] and other phytoplankton to incorporate and the churning of surface waters keeps them in the [[euphotic]] or sunlit biologically active depths without sinking for long periods.

===Carbon sequestration===
{{Main article|Carbon sequestration}}
[[Image:CO2 pump hg.svg|thumb|400px|left|Air-sea exchange of {{chem|CO|2}}]]
Previous instances of biological carbon sequestration triggered major climatic changes, lowering the temperature of the planet, such as the [[Azolla event]].  Plankton that generate [[calcium]] or [[silicon]] [[carbonate]] skeletons, such as [[diatom]]s, [[coccolithophore]]s and [[foraminifera]], account for most direct sequestration. When these organisms die their carbonate skeletons sink relatively quickly and form a major component of the carbon-rich deep sea precipitation known as [[marine snow]]. Marine snow also includes fish fecal pellets and other organic detritus, and steadily falls thousands of meters below active plankton blooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coml.org/medres/img/mir2dive1clip108.mpg|title=Video of extremely heavy amounts of "marine snow" in the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Michael Vecchione, NOAA Fisheries Systematics Lab|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908015726/http://www.coml.org/medres/img/mir2dive1clip108.mpg|archivedate=2006-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the carbon-rich biomass generated by plankton blooms, half (or more) is generally consumed by grazing organisms ([[zooplankton]], [[krill]], small fish, etc.) but 20 to 30% sinks below {{convert|200|m|ft|sp=us}} into the colder water strata below the [[thermocline]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Much of this fixed carbon continues into the abyss, but a substantial percentage is redissolved and remineralized. At this depth, however, this carbon is now suspended in deep currents and effectively isolated from the atmosphere for centuries. (The surface to [[benthic]] cycling time for the ocean is approximately 4,000 years.)

====Analysis and quantification====
Evaluation of the biological effects and verification of the amount of carbon actually sequestered by any particular bloom involves a variety of measurements, combining ship-borne and remote sampling, submarine filtration traps, tracking buoy [[spectroscopy]] and [[List of Earth observation satellites|satellite telemetry]]. Unpredictable ocean currents can remove experimental iron patches from the pelagic zone, invalidating the experiment.

The potential of fertilization to tackle global warming is illustrated by the following figures. If [[phytoplankton]] converted all the [[nitrate]] and [[phosphate]] present in the surface mixed layer across the entire [[Antarctic circumpolar current]] into [[organic carbon]], the resulting carbon dioxide deficit could be compensated by uptake from the [[atmosphere]] amounting to about 0.8 to 1.4 [[gigatonnes]] of carbon per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schiermeier Q |title=Climate change: The oresmen |journal=Nature |volume=421 |issue=6919 |pages=109–10 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12520274 |doi=10.1038/421109a |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..109S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This quantity is comparable in magnitude to annual [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[fossil fuels]] combustion of approximately 6 gigatonnes. The [[Antarctic circumpolar current]] region is one of several in which iron fertilization could be conducted&amp;mdash;the [[Galapagos]] islands area another potentially suitable location.

===Dimethyl sulfide and clouds===
[[File:CLAW hypothesis graphic 1 AYool.png|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of the CLAW hypothesis (Charlson ''et al.'', 1987)&lt;ref name="CLAW87"/&gt;]]
Some species of plankton produce [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS), a portion of which enters the atmosphere where it is oxidized by [[hydroxyl radical]]s (OH), atomic [[chlorine]] (Cl) and [[bromine]] monoxide (BrO) to form sulfate particles, and potentially increase cloud cover. This may increase the [[albedo]] of the planet and so cause cooling - this proposed mechanism is central to the [[CLAW hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R.

During SOFeX, DMS concentrations increased by a factor of four inside the fertilized patch.  Widescale iron fertilization of the Southern Ocean could lead to significant sulfur-triggered cooling in addition to that due to the {{chem|CO|2}} uptake and that due to the ocean's albedo increase, however the amount of cooling by this particular effect is very uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/101/23/8537| last=Wingenter| first=Oliver W. |author2=Karl B.

[[Ocean privatization]] could additionally create the possibility of profits through increased fish stocks.

==Sequestration definitions==
Carbon is not considered "sequestered" unless it settles to the ocean floor where it may remain for millions of years. Most of the carbon that sinks beneath plankton blooms is dissolved and remineralized well above the seafloor and eventually (days to centuries) returns to the atmosphere, negating the original benefit &lt;ref name="robinson14"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robinson |first1=Josie |last2=Popova |first2=Ekaterina E. |last3=Yool |first3=Andrew |last4=Srokosz |first4=Meric |last5=Lampitt |first5=Richard S. |last6=Blundell |first6=Jeff.

Advocates argue that modern climate scientists and [[Kyoto Protocol]] policy makers define sequestration over much shorter time frames. For example, trees and grasslands are viewed as important [[carbon sink]]s. Forest [[biomass]] sequesters carbon for decades, but carbon that sinks below the marine [[thermocline]] (100–200 meters) is removed from the atmosphere for hundreds of years, whether it is remineralized or not. Since deep ocean currents take so long to resurface, their carbon content is effectively sequestered by the criterion in use today.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Debate==
{{More citations needed|date=January 2009}}

While ocean iron fertilization could represent a potent means to slow global warming current debate raises a variety of concerns.

===Precautionary principle===
{{main article|Precautionary principle}}

The ''precautionary principle'' (PP) states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm, in the absence of [[scientific consensus]], the [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] that it is not harmful falls on those who would take the action. The side effects of large-scale iron fertilization are not yet quantified. Creating phytoplankton blooms in iron-poor areas is like watering the desert: in effect it changes one type of ecosystem into another. The argument can be applied in reverse, by considering emissions to be the action and remediation an attempt to partially offset the damage.

Fertilization advocates respond that [[algal bloom]]s have occurred naturally for millions of years with no observed ill effects. The [[Azolla event]] occurred around 49 million years ago and accomplished what fertilization is intended to achieve (but on a larger scale).

=== 20th-century phytoplankton decline===
While advocates argue that iron addition would help to reverse a supposed decline in phytoplankton, this decline may not be real. One study reported a decline in ocean productivity comparing the 1979–1986 and 1997–2000 periods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Gregg WW, Conkright ME, O'Reilly JE, etal |title=NOAA-NASA Coastal Zone Color Scanner reanalysis effort |journal=Appl Opt |volume=41 |issue=9 |pages=1615–28 |date=March 2002 |pmid=11921788 |url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-41-9-1615 |doi=10.1364/AO.41.001615|bibcode = 2002ApOpt..41.1615G }}&lt;/ref&gt; but two others found ''increases'' in phytoplankton.&lt;ref&gt;(Antoine ''et al.''., 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregg ''et al.''. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study of oceanic transparency since 1899 and in situ chlorophyll measurements concluded that oceanic phytoplankton medians decreased by ~1% per year over that century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyce |first1=Daniel G. |last2=Lewis |first2=Marion R. |last3=Worm |first3=Boris |title=Global phytoplankton decline over the past century |journal=Nature |date=2010 |volume=466 |issue=July 29, 2010 |pages=591–596 |doi=10.1038/nature09268 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v466/n7306/full/nature09268.html |accessdate=July 3, 2015 |pmid=20671703|bibcode=2010Natur.466..591B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological issues===

====Algal blooms====
{{main article|Harmful algal bloom}}
[[Image:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|left|A "red tide" off the coast of [[La Jolla, San Diego, California]].]]
Critics are concerned that fertilization will create ''[[harmful algal bloom]]s'' (HAB). The species that respond most strongly to fertilization vary by location and other factors and could possibly include species that cause [[red tide]]s and other toxic phenomena. These factors affect only near-shore waters, although they show that increased phytoplankton populations are not universally benign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/the-global-complex-phenomena-of-harmful-algal-blooms|title=The Global, Complex Phenomena of Harmful Algal Blooms {{!}} Oceanography|website=tos.org|access-date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most species of phytoplankton are harmless or beneficial, given that they constitute the base of the marine food chain. Fertilization increases phytoplankton only in the open oceans (far from shore) where iron deficiency is substantial. Most coastal waters are replete with iron and adding more has no useful effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JK|first=Moore,|last2=SC|first2=Doney,|last3=DM|first3=Glover,|last4=IY|first4=Fung,|date=2002-01-19|title=Iron cycling and nutrient-limitation patterns in surface waters of the world ocean|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/17x1c4nh|journal=Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|language=en|volume=49|issue=1–3|doi=10.1016/S0967-0645(01)00109-6|issn=0967-0645|pages=463–507|bibcode=2001DSRII..49..463M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study of iron fertilization in an oceanic high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll environment, however, found that fertilized ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]'' diatom spp., which are generally nontoxic in the open ocean, began producing toxic levels of [[domoic acid]]. Even short-lived blooms containing such toxins could have detrimental effects on marine food webs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0910579107 | author = Tricka, Charles G., Brian D. Bill, William P. Cochlan, Mark L. Wells, Vera L. Trainer, and Lisa D. Pickell | year = 2010 | title = Iron enrichment stimulates toxic diatom production in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll areas | journal = [[PNAS]] | volume = 107 | issue = 13 | pages = 5887–5892 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/107/13/5887.abstract | pmid = 20231473 | pmc = 2851856|bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.5887T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deep water oxygen levels====
When organic bloom detritus sinks into the abyss, a significant fraction is devoured by [[bacteria]], other microorganisms and deep sea animals that also consume oxygen. A large enough bloom could render certain regions beneath it [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] and threaten other [[benthic]] species. However this would entail the removal of oxygen from thousands of cubic km of benthic water beneath a bloom and so seems unlikely.

The largest plankton replenishment projects under consideration are less than 10% the size of most natural wind-fed blooms. In the wake of major dust storms, natural blooms have been studied since the beginning of the 20th century and no such deep water dieoffs have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grenz|first=Christian|last2=Cloern|first2=James E.|last3=Hager|first3=Stephen W.|last4=Cole|first4=Brian E.|date=2000|title=Dynamics of nutrient cycling and related benthic nutrient and oxygen fluxes during a spring phytoplankton bloom in South San Francisco Bay (USA)|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=197|pages=67–80|doi=10.3354/meps197067|jstor=24855745|bibcode=2000MEPS..197...67G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecosystem effects====
Depending upon the composition and timing of delivery, iron infusions could preferentially favor certain species and alter surface ecosystems to unknown effect. Population explosions of [[jellyfish]], that disturb the food chain impacting [[whale]] populations or fisheries is unlikely as iron fertilization experiments that are conducted in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll waters favor the growth of larger diatoms over small flagellates. This has been shown to lead to increased abundance of fish and whales over jellyfish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 =Parsons| first1 =T.R.| last2 = Lalli | first2 = C.M.| title = Jellyfish Population Explosions:Revisiting a Hypothesis of Possible Causes| journal =La Mer| volume = 40| pages=111–121|year=2002|url=http://www.drtimparsons.ca/Parsons-Lalli_JellyfishPopulationExplosions.pdf| accessdate = July 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study showed that iron enrichment stimulates toxic [[diatom]] production in high-nitrate, low-chlorophyll areas &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 =Trick| first1 =Charles G. |author2=Brian D. Bill |author3=William P. Cochlan |author4=Mark L. Wells |author5=Vera L. Trainer |author6=Lisa D.

Nitrogen released by cetaceans and [[iron chelate]] are a significant benefit to the marine [[food chain]] in addition to sequestering carbon for long periods of time.&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/10/101012101255.htm|title=Whale poop pumps up ocean health|author=Brown, Joshua E.|date=12 Oct 2010|website=Science Daily|accessdate=18 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, {{chem|CO|2}}-induced surface water heating and rising carbonic acidity are shifting population distributions for phytoplankton, zooplankton and many other populations. Optimal fertilization could potentially help restore lost/threatened ecosystem services.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==== Ocean Acidification ====
A 2009 study tested the potential of iron fertilization to reduce both atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ocean acidity using a global ocean carbon model. The study showed that an optimized regime of micronutrient introduction would reduce the predicted increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by more than 20 percent. Unfortunately, the impact on [[ocean acidification]] would be minimal due to the higher proportions of carbon dioxide taken into the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Long|last2=Caldeira|first2=Ken|title=Can ocean iron fertilization mitigate ocean acidification?|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.proxy.library.oregonstate.edu/article/10.1007/s10584-010-9799-4|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=99|issue=1–2|pages=303–311|doi=10.1007/s10584-010-9799-4|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kairos''' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:καιρός#Ancient Greek|καιρός]]}}) is an [[Ancient Greek]] word meaning the right, critical, or opportune moment.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, Greek-English Lexicon.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ancient Greeks had two words for [[time]]: [[chronos]] ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:χρόνος#Ancient Greek|χρόνος]]}}) and kairos. The former refers to [[chronology|chronological]] or sequential [[time]], while the latter signifies a proper or opportune time for action. While chronos is quantitative, kairos has a qualitative, permanent nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkairo%2Fs1 |title=(Dictionary Entry) |work=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon |accessdate=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kairos'' also means ''weather'' in [[Modern Greek]]. The plural, καιροί (''kairoi'' (Ancient and Modern Greek)) means ''the times''. Kairos is a term, idea, and practice that has been applied in several fields including classical rhetoric, modern rhetoric, digital media, Christian theology, and science.

==Origins==
In [[Richard Broxton Onians|Onians']] 1951 etymological studies of the word, he traces the primary root back to the ancient Greek association with both [[archery]] and [[weaving]]. In archery, kairos denotes the moment in which an arrow may be fired with sufficient force to penetrate a target. In weaving, kairos denotes the moment in which the [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] could be passed through threads on the [[loom]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson,Hunter W. (2005) "Forecasting Opportunity: Kairos, Production, and Writing, p.4. University Press of America: Oxford&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature of the classical period, writers and orators used kairos to specify moments when the opportune action was made, often through metaphors involving archery and one’s ability to aim and fire at the exact right time on-target. For example, in [[The Suppliants (Euripides)|The Suppliants]], a drama written by [[Euripides]], [[Adrastus]] describes the ability to influence and change another person’s mind by “aiming their bow beyond the kairos.”

Kairos is also an alternate spelling of the minor Greek deity Caerus, the god of luck and opportunity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Gary|date=2012|title=Electronic Kairos|url=https://umaryland-on-worldcat-org.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/atoztitles/link?genre=article&amp;atitle=Electronic%20Kairos.&amp;title=At%20the%20Interface%20/%20Probing%20the%20Boundaries&amp;issn=15707113&amp;isbn=&amp;volume=83&amp;issue=&amp;date=20120901&amp;aulast=Thompson%2C%20Gary&amp;spage=3&amp;pages=3-13&amp;sid=EBSCO:Communication%20%26%20Mass%20Media%20Complete|journal=At the Interface / Probing the Boundaries|volume=83|pages=3–13|via=MLA International Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In classical rhetoric==
In [[rhetoric]], ''kairos'' is "a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved."&lt;ref&gt;E. C. White, ''Kaironomia'' p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Kairos was central to the [[Sophists]], who stressed the rhetor's ability to adapt to and take advantage of changing, contingent circumstances. In ''Panathenaicus'', [[Isocrates]] writes that educated people are those “who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day, and who possess a judgment which is accurate in meeting occasions as they arise and rarely misses the expedient course of action".

Kairos is also very important in [[Aristotle]]'s scheme of rhetoric. Kairos is, for Aristotle, the time and space context in which the [[Proof (truth)|proof]] will be delivered. Kairos stands alongside other contextual elements of rhetoric: ''The Audience'', which is the psychological and emotional makeup of those who will receive the proof; and ''To Prepon'', which is the style with which the orator clothes the proof.

In Ancient Greece, "kairos" was utilized by both of the two main schools of thought in the field of rhetoric. The competing schools were that of the [[Sophists]], and that of their opposition, led by individuals such as Aristotle and [[Plato]]. Sophism approached rhetoric as an art form. Members of the school would travel around Greece teaching citizens about the art of rhetoric and successful discourse. In his article "Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric", [[John Poulakos]] defines rhetoric from a Sophistic perspective as follows: "Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible."&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poulakos|first=John|title=Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=16|issue=1|pages=35–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle and Plato, on the other hand, viewed Sophistic rhetoric as a tool used to manipulate others, and criticized those who taught it. 
 
Kairos fits into the Sophistic scheme of rhetoric in conjunction with the ideas of prepon and dynaton. These two terms combined with kairos are their keys to successful rhetoric. As stated by Poulakos, Prepon deals with the notion that "what is said must conform to both audience and occasion."&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"/&gt; Dynaton has to do with the idea of the possible, or what the speaker is attempting to convince the audience of. Kairos in the Sophistic context is based on the thought that speech must happen at a certain time in order for it to be most effective. If rhetoric is to be meaningful and successful, it must be presented at the right moment, or else it will not have the same impact on the members of the audience. 
 
Aristotle and his followers also discuss the importance of kairos in their teachings. In his ''Rhetoric'', one of the ways that Aristotle uses the idea of kairos is in reference to the specificity of each rhetorical situation. Aristotle believed that each rhetorical situation was different, and therefore different rhetorical devices needed to be applied at that point in time. One of the most well known parts of Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' is when he discusses the roles of pathos, ethos, and logos. Aristotle ties kairos to these concepts, claiming that there are times in each rhetorical situation when one needs to be utilized over the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kinneavy|first=James|author2=Catherine Eskin|title=Kairos in Aristotle's Rhetoric|journal=Written Communication|year=2000|volume=17|issue=3|pages=432–444|doi=10.1177/0741088300017003005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kairos has classically been defined as a concept that focused on "'the uniquely timely, the spontaneous, the radically particular.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paul|first1=Joanne|title=The use of Kairos in Renaissance Political Philosophy|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|date=Spring 2014|volume=67|issue=1|page=43|jstor=10.1086/676152}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient Pythagoreans thought Kairos to be one of the most fundamental laws of the universe.  Kairos was said to piece together the dualistic ways of the entire universe.  [[Empedocles]] was the philosopher who connect kairos to the principle of opposites and harmony.  It then became the principle of conflict and resolution and was thus inserted as a concept for rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Carter|first1=Michael |title=Stasis and Kairos: Principles of Social Construction in Classical Rhetoric|journal=Rhetoric Review|date=Autumn 1988|volume=7|issue=1|pages=101, 102|jstor=465537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern rhetorical definition==
In his article "Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the Place and Process of Rhetoric," Aaron Hess submits a definition of kairos for the present day that bridges the two classical applications. Hess addresses Poulakos’s view that, “In short, kairos dictates that what is said must be said at the right time.”&lt;ref name="Poulakos 1983 35–48"/&gt; He also suggests that in addition to timeliness kairos considers appropriateness. According to Hess, kairos can either be understood as, "the decorum or propriety of any given moment and speech act, implying a reliance on the given or known" or as, "the opportune, spontaneous, or timely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hess|first=Aaron|title=Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the place and Process of Rhetoric|journal=Communication Studies|year=2011|volume=62|issue=2|page=138|doi=10.1080/10510974.2011.529750}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these two ideas of kairos might seem conflicting, Hess says that they offer a more extensive understanding of the term. Furthermore, they encourage creativity, which is necessary to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and opinions that can alter the opportune or appropriate moment, i.e. kairos. Being able to recognize the propriety of a situation while having the ability to adapt one’s rhetoric allows taking advantage of kairos to be successful. Hess’s updated definition of kairos concludes that along with taking advantage of the timeliness and appropriateness of a situation, the term also implies being knowledgeable of and involved in the environment where the situation is taking place in order to benefit fully from seizing the opportune moment.
 
Hess's conflicting perspective on kairos is exemplified by the disagreement between Lloyd F. Bitzer and Richard E. Vatz about the rhetorical situation. Bitzer argues that rhetorical situations exist independent of human perspective; a situation invites discourse. He discusses the feeling of a missed opportunity to speak (kairos) and the tendency to later create a speech in response to that unseized moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bitzer|first=Lloyd|title=The Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|date=January 1968|volume=1|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vatz counters Bitzer's view by claiming that a situation is made rhetorical by the perception of its interpreter and the way which they choose to respond to it, whether with discourse or not. It is the rhetor's responsibility to give an event meaning through linguistic depiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vatz|first=Richard|title=The Myth of the Rhetorical Situation|journal=Philosophy and Rhetoric|year=1983|volume=6.3|pages=155–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitzer's and Vatz's perspectives add depth to Hess's ideas that kairos is concerned with both timeliness and appropriateness. On one hand, Bitzer's argument supports Hess's claim that kairos is spontaneous, and one must be able to recognize the situation as opportune in order to take advantage of it. On the other hand, Vatz's idea that the rhetor is responsible reinforces Hess's suggestion of the need to be knowledgeable and involved in the surrounding environment in order to fully profit from the situation.

According to Bitzer, Kairos is composed of exigence, audience, and constraints. Exigence is the inherent pressure to do something about a situation immediately, with the action required depending on the situation. The audience are the listeners who the rhetor is attempting to persuade. Constraints are the external factors that challenges the rhetors ability to influence, such as the audience’s personal beliefs and motivations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gelang|first=Marie|date=2012|title=Kairos, the Rhythm of Timing|url=|journal=Thamyris/Intersecting: Place, Sex &amp; Race|volume=26|pages=89–101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, factors such as cultural background, previous social experiences, and current mood, can influence the capacity to see and understand the correct and opportune moment of action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thus, the difficulty of using kairos in a modern rhetorical setting is understanding and working within its constraints, while also carefully considering unexpected situations and encounters that arise, in order to present one’s rhetorical argument as naturally as possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'Kairos' modern English definition is vague.  There is no one word in today's English language that completely encompasses the definition of kairos, similar to that of [[Ethos]], [[Logos]], and [[Pathos]].  In his article "The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion," Michael Harker says, "Like the 'points' on the rhetorical triangle, the meaning of kairos is not definitive but rather a starting point for grasping the whole of an argument."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harker|first1=Michael|title=The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion|journal=College Composition and Communication|date=September 2007|volume=59|issue=1|page=80|jstor=20456982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kairos' inclusion in modern composition has not been implicitly made, but there are undertones.  Various components of kairos are included in modern composition and have made profound effects on modern composition theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harker|first1=Michael|title=The Ethics of Argument: Reread Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion|journal=College Composition and Communication|date=September 2007|volume=59|issue=1|page=85|jstor=20456982}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

Kairos' purpose in modern rhetoric is mostly focused on the placement of logos, pathos, and ethos.  Kairos is used as a "starting point" in modern rhetoric.  Kelly Pender's article "'Kairos' and the Subject of Expressive Discourse" states the inclusion of kairos within discourse "would try to shift the focus of personal writing from the writer's experiences and emotions to a broader perspective that explicitly concentrates on the rhetorical situation..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pender|first1=Kelly|title="Kairos" and the Subject of Expressive Discourse|journal=Composition Studies|date=Fall 2003|volume=31|issue=2|page=96|jstor=43501556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kairos is an expressive inclusion within the overall subject of discourse, and one that has an effect on the entire rhetoric.

==In Christian theology==
In the [[New Testament]], "kairos" means "the appointed time in the purpose of God," the time when God acts (e.g. {{bibleverse||Mark|1:15|NKJV}}: the ''kairos'' is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand). "Kairos" (used 86 times in the New Testament)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/2540.htm Strong's Greek Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to an opportune time, a "moment" or a "season" such as "harvest time," &lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|21:34|NKJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas "chronos" (used 54 times)&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblehub.com/greek/5550.htm Strong's Greek Concordance]&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a specific amount of time, such as a day or an hour (e.g. {{bibleverse||Acts|13:18|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|27:9|NKJV}}). Jesus makes a distinction in {{bibleverse||John|7:6|NKJV}} between "His" time and "[[Brothers of Jesus|His brothers]]'" time: [[paradox]]ically, it is "always" ({{lang-gr|πάντοτε}}) his brothers' time. In the context, they can go to [[Jerusalem]] any time they wish.

In the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] churches, before the [[Divine Liturgy]] begins, the [[Deacon]] exclaims to the [[Priest]], 'Καιρὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τῷ Κυρίῳ' (''Kairos tou poiēsai tō Kyriō''), i.e. "It is time [''kairos''] for the Lord to act", indicating that the time of the Liturgy is an intersection with Eternity.

In ''The Interpretation of History,'' [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] [[Lutheran]] theologian [[Paul Tillich]] made prominent use of the term. For him, the ''kairoi'' are those crises in history (see [[Christian existentialism]]) which create an opportunity for, and indeed demand, an existential decision by the human subject - the coming of Christ being the prime example (compare [[Karl Barth]]'s use of ''Geschichte'' as opposed to ''Historie''). In the [[Kairos Document]], an example of [[liberation theology]] in [[South Africa under apartheid]], the term ''kairos'' is used to denote "the appointed time," "the crucial time" into which the document or text is spoken.

==In science==

In [[Hippocrates]]’ (460-357 B.C.E) major theoretical treatises on the nature of medical science and methodology, the term “kairos” is used within the first line. Hippocrates is generally accepted as the father of medicine, but his contribution to the discourse of science is less discussed. While “kairos” most often refers to “the right time,” Hippocrates also used to term when referencing experimentation. Using this term allowed him to “express the variable components of medical practice more accurately.” Here the word refers more to proportion, the mean, and the implicit sense of right measure.

Hippocrates most famous quote about kairos is “every kairos is a chronos, but not every chronos is a kairos.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sipiora|first1=Phillip|last2=Baumlin|first2=James S.|title=Rhetoric and Kairos: Essays in History, Theory, and Praxis|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|pages=97–99|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ6r7ozilPMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy'' by Stephen Paul Witte, Neil Nakadate, Roger Dennis Cherry also discusses the art of kairos in the field of science. Citing [[John Swales]], the essay notes that the introduction sections of scientific research articles are nothing more than the construction of openings. This idea derives from the spacial aspect of kairos, or the creation of "an opening," which can be created by writers and discovered by readers. This opening is the opportune time, or kairos. Swales created what he called the "create a research space" model, wherein kairos, or an opening, was constructed. It consisted of four rhetorical moves. 1.) establishing the field. 2.) summarizing previous research. 3.) preparing for present research, and 4.) introducing the present research. The third step is one where a gap in previous research is indicated, thus creating the need for more information. The writer constructs a need, and an opening. Because kairos emphasizes change, it is an important aspect of science. Not all scientific research can be presented at the same time or in the same way, but creating an opening makes it possible to construct the right time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witte|first1=Stephen|last2=Nakadate|first2=Neil|last3=Cherry|first3=Roger|title=A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy|date=1992|publisher=SIU Press|pages=312–313|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EpA3cTT6iskC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=kairos+&amp;ots=L_mQnkEhmb&amp;sig=71BXqclQo_v5Tk0uuUEfTDYZqIQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kairos&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can easily be related back to Hippocrates statement that not every opening is an opportunity. Yet, in science, the message can be adapted in such a way that chronos becomes kairos.

The idea can also be expressed in the words of Carolyn M. Glasshoff who wrote that, specifically in the field of scientific writing, “any text must be influenced by the kairos that exists both before the text is created and during the presentation. In addition, each text helps create a new kairos for texts that come after.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glasshoff|first1=Carolyn M.|title=Gore 's Science The Kairos Of An Inconvenient Truth And The Implications For Science Writing|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2928&amp;context=etd|website=University of Central Florida STARS|publisher=University of Central Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Kairos in digital media ==
The historical context of the definition of kairos may make the concept appear outdated. However, the relevancy of kairos is at its peak as the world has rapidly transformed into a society dependent on digital technology. In order to recognize how kairos can be applied to online media and the challenges that occur as a result, a broad definition of the term is required. One definition makes the application of kairos to digital media easy to recognize, as it states kairos can be referred to as particular moment in which success is achieved when an opening is pursued with force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=David|date=2009|title=Kairos and New Media:  Toward a Theory and Practice of Visual Activism|url=http://enculturation.net/6.2/sheridan-michel-ridolfo|journal=Enculturation|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition prompts a main issue within the application of kairos to online content: if timing is crucial to the message of communication that is being received, how can we communicate effectively online, where anything can be published at any time?

The difficulty with modern rhetoric in the digital space is that the audience is less easily influenced by the rhetor. As such, it is difficult for rhetors to utilize kairos to the best of their abilities. Due to the nature of which modern audiences in the electronic age consume media, it is highly possible that they are multi-tasking, with their attention divided among multiple sources. This difficulty is compounded with the fact that this audience can consume discourse at different times, in different places, and through varying mediums. As a result, the audience is able to assign encountered discourse at various levels of personal priority. With this, they are able to discern which discourse they think is vital or interesting, and discard those they deem trivial or unworthy of their attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also multiple external factors that lead to the difficulty in using kairos in a modern setting. Since computer hardware, software, and even the underlying operating system all differ between people, it is difficult for the orator to take account for every permutation possible. Couple this with the lack of a true shared community online, since such virtual “cloakroom communities” are only temporary, and the difficulties in using kairos in the digital age becomes painfully clear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some scholars studying kairos in the modern digital sphere argue that the aspects of body/ identity, distribution/ circulation, access/ accessibility, interaction, and economics are handled differently in an online setting and therefore messages that are sent digitally need to be altered to fit the new circumstances. In order to reach online audiences effectively, scholars suggest that context of the information's use, which includes considerations of legal, health-related, disciplinary, and political factors paired with smart rhetorical thinking can solve the issue of miscommunicated messages distributed on online forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Porter|first=James|date=2009|title=Recovering Delivery for Digital Rhetoric|url=https://summitsguide.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/porter_recovering-delivery-for-digital-rhetoric.pdf|journal=Computers and Composition|volume=26|pages=207–224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1625">In [[Ancient Greek|classical Greek]] [[rhetoric]], '''topos''', ''pl.'' '''topoi''', (from {{lang-grc|τόπος}} 'place,' elliptical for {{lang-grc|τόπος κοινός}} ''tópos koinós'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Commonplace|volume=6|page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'common place'), in [[Latin language|Latin]] '''''locus''''' (from ''locus communis''), refers  to a method for developing arguments. (See [[Inventio#Topoi|''topoi'' in classical rhetoric]].)

==Meaning and history==
Topos is translated variously as "topic," "line of argument," or "commonplace." [[Ernst Robert Curtius]] studied topoi as "commonplaces," themes common to orators and writers who re-worked them according to occasion, e.g., in classical antiquity the observation that “all must die” was a topos in consolatory oratory, for in facing death the knowledge that death comes even to great men brings comfort.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Robert Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'', trans. from German by Willard R. Trask (New York, NY: Pantheon Books, 1953), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtius also discussed the topoi in the invocation of nature (sky, seas, animals, etc.) for various rhetorical purposes, such as witnessing to an oath, rejoicing or praising God, or mourning with the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Curtius, ''European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages'', 92–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

MVA has strict rules governing the orientation and proportions of a building.&lt;ref name=Toner&gt;{{cite news|title=Houses that boost health and wealth|first=Niall |last=Toner|work=Sunday Times|location=London (UK)|date=July 22, 2007|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important factor is the entrance, which must be either due east or due north.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; The MVA architect also considers the slope and shape of the lot, exposure to the rising sun, location of nearby bodies of water and the other buildings or activities in the nearby environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_07_AAAMag_ltr.pdf Egenes, Linda "Spotlight: Maharishi Vedic City", ''AAA Magazine'' (July 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; MVA emphasizes the use of natural or "green" building materials.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

MVA homes are marketed in the US by Maharishi Global Construction, LLC,&lt;ref name=Hutchinson/&gt; and by MVA Homes in the UK, both arms of the [[Transcendental Meditation movement]].&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Several communities around the world have been developed using MVA principles. The plans for [[#Peace Tower project|Peace Tower]], which would have been the world's tallest building, followed MVA specifications.

==Principles and effects==
According to [[#Maharishi Global Construction|Maharishi Global Construction]] (MGC) in [[Fairfield, Iowa]], building a home according to the principles of MVA "connects the individual intelligence of the occupant of the house to the cosmic intelligence of the universe".&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_09_TimesJourCont.pdf Times Journal of Construction and Design, In Accord With Nature, Niranjan Mudholkar, September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of MVA say its basis is in the [[Vedas]], 5,000-year-old Sanskrit texts that assert a connection between human health and building materials, orientation to the movements of the sun and spatial relationships.&lt;ref name=Spivack/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt; According to Lipman, Vedic architecture and [[feng shui]] have a common root, but MVA is more scientific, while feng shui has superstitious elements.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt; Lipman says that MVA is derived from "lost and misunderstood" principles, natural law, "whereby the entire universe is created: galaxies, planets, human beings" along with buildings and cities.&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt;

Craig Pearson, Executive Vice President of [[Maharishi University of Management]] (MUM), claims that spending time in buildings that follow these principles makes one smarter.&lt;ref name=Willdorf&gt;{{cite journal|title=Karma and wrecking balls|first=Nina|last=Willdorf|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|location=Washington|date=June 2, 2000|volume=46|issue=39|page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents claim that MVA homes have escaped wildfires that burned neighboring homes, and that businesses located in MVA office buildings have greater profit and lower absenteeism.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Residents of MVA homes in [[Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa]] claim they felt vitality, calm and happiness when they moved into their Vedic houses. A mother claims that her boys are more orderly.&lt;ref name=Balachandran/&gt; Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has said, "Living in a proper vastu can eliminate 60 to 80 percent of the problems we encounter in life."&lt;ref name=Balachandran&gt;{{cite news|title=Vedic city: A city in the US follows building principles set in the Vedas|first=R. |last=Balachandran|date=September 9, 2001|work=The Week (Indian magazine)|location=Kerala, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Warburton, Raja of England, says that the practice of Maharishi’s Vedic peace technologies is more powerful with Vastu buildings.&lt;ref name=Warburton/&gt; Yale University architecture professor [[Keller Easterling]] says that MVA is fueled by a desire to create outposts for broadcasting the [[Maharishi Effect]].&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt;

Maharishi Sthapatya Veda is considered to be an element of the [[Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health]], and the main modality of MVAH for improving the immediate environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Schneider| first1 = Robert H. | last2 = Fields| first2 = Jeremy Z. | title = Total heart health : how to prevent and reverse heart disease with the maharishi vedic approach to health | year = 2006 | publisher = Basic Health Publications | location = Laguna Beach, CA | isbn = 978-1-59120-087-1 | pages=64, 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Siting===
Auspicious locations have water to the east or north.&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt; If water is in an inauspicious location then it can be balanced with fountains on the north side.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt; Items in the nearby environment that generate electro-magnetic fields, such as high tension wires and microwave towers, are avoided.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The slope, if any, should be towards the east, and there should be no obstructions that block the sun's first rays.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt;

===Orientation===
[[File:Maharishi Centre for Educational Excellence, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India..jpg|thumb|left|350px|MCEE School Campus at Bhopal, India, '''facing due east''']]
The principles of orientation in Maharishi Sthapatya Veda are based on the position of the sun, considered by MVA to be the most powerful natural influence on Earth.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt; Aligning a structure with the rising sun (facing east) is considered by MVA adherents to be auspicious for the building's inhabitants and to be "spiritually healthy."&lt;ref name=Aspan&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0362-4331| last = Aspan| first = Maria| title = Maharishi’s Minions Come to Wall Street| work = The New York Times| accessdate=December 17, 2009 |date = 2007-07-02| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/02/business/worldbusiness/02maharishi.html?_r=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the principles of MVA, the other three cardinal directions also have their corresponding influences. For example, homes with entrances facing west invite "poverty, lack of creativity and vitality,"&lt;ref name="Kansas City Star"&gt;Canon, Scott, "Maharishi's followers have integrated into small Iowa town" ''Kansas City Star'', (September 28, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and "anxiety, depression, bad luck and even criminal tendencies."&lt;ref name="rickross.com"&gt;"Reclusive Guru's in Battle to Demolish Historic Dutch Monastery" ''Associated Press'', January 20, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MVA official website, the north direction has the influence of prosperity and happiness and the south direction has the influence of negativity, problems and suffering.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Proper orientation is also said to increase business productivity.

===Placement===
When a house for a particular individual is being designed using MVA principles, the placement of the building and its rooms are carefully planned according to their intended usage and the influence of the sun as it moves throughout the day.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"&gt;[http://download.tmnews.org/2005_07_22_AmericanWay_ltr.pdf Kissel, William "Home and Peace", ''American Way'' (July 15 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Rooms are placed to "take in the sun's light as it passes overhead." Windows and skylights are also used to allow as much natural sunlight as possible to enter the building.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt; An aspect of MVA called "Vastu Vidya" determines the places in the building that are used for generating and storing natural elements like fire and water, heating and plumbing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Bathroom fixtures such as sinks and mirrors also have a particular placement according to MVA rules;&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions/&gt; Toilets have a particular direction depending on the Vastu design&lt;ref name=Hutchinson&gt;{{cite news|title=Wasting away in Maharishi-ville|first=Brian |last=Hutchinson|work=National Post|location=Don Mills, Ont.|date= February 22, 2003|page=B.1.Fro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kitchens and dining rooms should be on the east side, and offices on the west.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt;  commercial buildings are often designed as linear "bar buildings" to offer the most east-facing exposure.&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt;

===Proportion===
MVA says that symmetry is orderly and helps to coordinate the various aspects of a structure, and that there is an ideal proportion for every room in a home or office. Also, the length, width and elevation of the building are calculated using the ancient Vedic mathematical formulas and requires a level of construction precision to one-eighth of an inch.&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions/&gt;

MVA planning and building takes into account the effects of the sun, moon, planets and stars, and also using the poles and the equator as reference points.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Its measurements and proportions are said to be calculated in reference to proportions of the human physiology and the cosmos, and in harmony with nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Features===
[[File:Maharishi Headquarters in Holland- cropped.jpg|thumb|A ''kalash'' atop a ''Brahmasthan'', with the flag of the [[Global Country of World Peace]], on the Maharishi's HQ in Vlodrop.]]
One of the features of MVA design is the ''[[Brahmasthan]]'', whose literal translation is "establish wholeness". The ''Brahmasthan'' is a central space "lit by a skylight" that serves as a "silent core" and is "never walked on".&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/transcendental-meditation-vedic-city-iowa/story?id=9218475 Berman, John and Burbank, Maggie, "Transcendental Meditation thrives in Iowa", ''ABC News'' (January 8 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmastan'' is said to act as the "nucleus" or axis point for the structure like the nucleus of a cell or an atom.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="American Way"/&gt;

Other features include a perimeter designation called a ''vastu'' fence. This boundary line may consist of shrubs or a metal, stone or wood fence. It is ideally about {{convert|30|ft|m}} away from the front and back of the building and eight feet away from the sides.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Another feature is a "small, golden, roof ornament" or [[cupola]], called a ''[[Kalasha|kalash]]'', which one MVA architect says improves the connection between the residents and heaven.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutchinson/&gt; A defined plinth is another standard element.&lt;ref name=Toner/&gt; Color is also covered by MVA.&lt;ref name=Paradkar&gt;{{cite news|title=Before feng shui, there was vastu shastra; Indian science has formulas to align a home with nature Interiors, decor can be modified to best advantage|first=Bageshree |last=Paradkar|work=Toronto Star|date=March 10, 2005|page=J.06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ceremonies====
Three "special ceremonies" performed on "auspicious dates" are recommended by MVA. These include a ground breaking, which is described as digging a precise square hole while facing east, adding organic fertilizer and "sacred water" from India, and making statements of goodwill and success for the new construction. The second ceremony is the laying of the cornerstone and the third is moving-in.&lt;ref name=ArchImpressions&gt;Architectural Impressions, 2005 Edition, the Maharishi Vedic Center, Alan Sullivan&lt;/ref&gt;

===Materials===
MVA buildings should not contain any iron or steel.&lt;ref name=TMB91&gt;{{cite news|title=Details of World's Most Advanced 'Sustainable' and 'Fortune-Creating' Building |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=September 2008 |url=http://www.tmbulletin.com/Volume9/TMBulletinV9I01.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717063738/http://www.tmbulletin.com/Volume9/TMBulletinV9I01.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MVA emphasizes the use of natural or "green" building materials such as wood, bricks, adobe, rammed earth, clay, stucco and marble. Other natural fibers such as wood, paper, cotton and wool are used in the interior.&lt;ref name=Argus/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The use of natural materials, along with spacious plots and layouts, mean that MVA homes can be expensive, according to the MGC sales director, Eloise Raymond.&lt;ref name=Gadd/&gt;

[[File:Clarion Hotel building in Hartford, Connecticut, 2010-02-20.jpg|thumb|upright|Clarion Hotel building in Hartford, Connecticut]]
The Maharishi Global Development Fund (MGDF) was founded in 1997 in New York City. It had an initial capital of $430 million, which grew by hundreds of millions, and the stated capacity to handle multiple projects in several counties worth billions of dollars.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; It has the goal of constructing buildings that reduce the world's problems.&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; It is also concerned with building cities and countries.&lt;ref name=Easterling&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-55065-2| last = Easterling| first = Keller|authorlink=Keller Easterling|title = Enduring Innocence: Global Architecture and Its Political Masquerades| date = 2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was inaugurated on the top floor of the World Trade Center in 1997, and was a tenant on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].&lt;ref name=Easterling/&gt;

==Global Reconstruction==
The Maharishi's Global Reconstruction Program for Permanent World Peace entails replacing the existing cities and buildings of the world with plans and structures that follow MVA principles. The project is estimated by the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) Finance Minister to cost $300 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press-conference.globalgoodnews.com/archive/january/06-01-18.html |title=Maharishi Press Conference Highlights |publisher=globalgoodnews.com |accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A goal of the MGDF is to achieve "heaven on earth".&lt;ref name=Taylor/&gt; The Director of the Global Country of World Peace's [[Global Country of World Peace#Financial Capital|Financial Capital]], Paul Potter, said "we hope to be able to rebuild the whole world to be fortune-oriented buildings, to be heaven on earth".&lt;ref name=Aspan/&gt;

A 2000 document from the Maharishi Global Development Fund outlines a proposed method for cities to transition to Vastu buildings. The first phase is "controlling the expansion of the city by establishing a masterplan with parallel roads in east/west, north/south directions". The second phase is "construction of ideal villages and satellite towns around the city, free from pollution". The third is "starting to demolish congested areas in the city center, replacing them with beautiful gardens, parks and fountains".

==Reception==
After hearing a presentation on MVA at the [[National Building Museum]] in 2005, a ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporter said that "non-adherents" may find the principles "eccentric, to say the least," as houses not facing east or north are said by MVA adherents to be "practically begging inauspicious forces to sweep in and wreak havoc." The reporter goes on to say that many architects would not "quibble" with other components of MVA such as "balance and symmetry", a vastu fence or wall and "solar influenced" placement of rooms in the home.&lt;ref name=Turrentine&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/06/AR2005070600611.html Turrentine, Jeff , "Mind over mortar", ''Washington Post'' (July 7 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' travel writer Carina Chocano writes that Maharishi Vedic City "displays all the architectural characteristics of a new exurban development: gaudy, oversize construction that has no stylistic relation to its environment but instead vaguely alludes to a theme-park version, someplace sort of magical and far away."&lt;ref name=Chocano&gt;[http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-tr-vedic10sep10?page=1 Chocano, Carina, "Meditation comes with creature comforts at Iowa's Maharishi University", ''Los Angeles Times'' (September 10, 2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max-Planck-Institut.jpg|thumbnail|Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für ausländisches und internationales Strafrecht}}) is a non-university research institute located in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. The institute is part of the [[Max Planck Society]] and is conducting basic research into [[criminal law]] and [[criminology]].

The Institute is currently headed by [[Hans-Jörg Albrecht]] (criminology) and [[Ulrich Sieber]] (criminal law). In 2006, the Institute had a total of 149 employees, including 30 researchers and 51 young researchers, as well as 20 third-party employees and 41 visiting researchers. The library comprises more than 400,000 titles and is one of the largest libraries in the area. A former director is [[Albin Eser]].

== History ==
The history of the Institute dates back to 1938, when by [[Adolf Schönke]] held the "Seminar for Foreign and International Criminal Law" at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]]. This led to the founding of the "Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law" in 1947. The Institute was renamed in 1966, when it joined the Max Planck Society.

'''Mimesis''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|m|iː|s|ɪ|s|,_|m|ə|-|,_|m|aɪ|-|,_|-|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|μίμησις}} ''mīmēsis'', from μιμεῖσθαι ''mīmeisthai'', "to imitate", from [[Wikt:μῖμος|μῖμος]] ''mimos'', "imitator, actor") is a [[Literary criticism|critical]] and philosophical term that carries a wide range of meanings, which include [[imitation]], [[representation (arts)|representation]], [[mimicry]], ''imitatio'', receptivity, nonsensuous similarity, the act of resembling, the act of expression, and the [[impression management|presentation of the self]].&lt;ref&gt;Gebauer and Wulf (1992, 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Greece]], mimesis was an idea that governed the creation of works of art, in particular, with correspondence to the physical world understood as a model for beauty, [[truth]], and the good. [[Plato]] contrasted mimesis, or [[imitation]], with [[diegesis]], or narrative. After Plato, the meaning of mimesis eventually shifted toward a specifically literary function in ancient Greek society, and its use has changed and been reinterpreted many times since.

One of the best-known modern studies of mimesis, understood as a form of [[realism (literature)|realism]] in literature, is [[Erich Auerbach]]'s ''[[Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature]]'', which opens with a famous comparison between the way the world is represented in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the way it appears in the ''Bible''. From these two seminal Western texts, Auerbach builds the foundation for a unified theory of representation that spans the entire history of Western literature, including the Modernist novels being written at the time Auerbach began his study. In [[art history]], "mimesis", "realism" and "naturalism" are used, often interchangeably, as terms for the accurate, even "illusionistic", [[Realism (arts)#Illusionistic realism|representation of the visual appearance of things]].

Mimesis has been theorised by thinkers as diverse as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Philip Sidney]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Gabriel Tarde]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Erich Auerbach]], [[Paul Ricœur]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[René Girard]], [[Nikolas Kompridis]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Michael Taussig]], [[Merlin Donald]], and [[Homi K. Bhabha|Homi Bhabha]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Classical definitions==

===Plato===
Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] saw in mimesis the [[representation (arts)|representation]] of [[nature]], including human nature, as reflected in the dramas of the period. Plato wrote about mimesis in both ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'' and ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (Books&amp;nbsp;II, III, and X). In ''Ion'', he states that poetry is the art of divine madness, or inspiration. Because the poet is subject to this divine madness, instead of possessing "art" or "knowledge" – ''[[techne]]'' – of the subject (532c), the poet does not speak truth (as characterized by Plato's [[Theory of forms|account of the Forms]]). As Plato has it, truth is only the concern of the philosopher. As culture in those days did not consist in the solitary reading of books, but in the listening to performances, the recitals of orators (and poets), or the acting out by classical actors of tragedy, Plato maintained in his critique that theatre was not sufficient in conveying the truth (540c). He was concerned that actors or orators were thus able to persuade an audience by rhetoric rather than by telling the truth (535b).

In Book&amp;nbsp;II of ''The Republic'', Plato describes [[Socrates]]' dialogue with his pupils. Socrates warns we should not seriously regard poetry as being capable of attaining the truth and that we who listen to poetry should be on our guard against its seductions, since the poet has no place in our idea of God.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing this in Book&amp;nbsp;X, Plato told of Socrates' metaphor of the three beds: one bed exists as an idea made by God (the [[Platonic ideal|Platonic ideal, or form]]); one is made by the [[carpenter]], in imitation of God's idea; one is made by the artist in imitation of the carpenter's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Republic'', 596–599.&lt;/ref&gt;

So the artist's bed is twice removed from the truth. Those who copy only touch on a small part of things as they really are, where a bed may appear differently from various points of view, looked at obliquely or directly, or differently again in a mirror. So painters or poets, though they may paint or describe a carpenter, or any other maker of things, know nothing of the carpenter's (the craftsman's) art,&lt;ref name=Republic&gt;{{cite book | last = Plato | title = Book X | work = The Republic | url =  http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.11.x.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and though the better painters or poets they are, the more faithfully their works of art will resemble the reality of the carpenter making a bed, nonetheless the imitators will still not attain the truth (of God's creation).&lt;ref name=Republic /&gt;

The poets, beginning with Homer, far from improving and educating humanity, do not possess the knowledge of craftsmen and are mere imitators who copy again and again images of virtue and rhapsodise about them, but never reach the truth in the way the superior philosophers do.

===Aristotle===
Similar to Plato's writings about mimesis, Aristotle also defined mimesis as the perfection, and imitation of nature. Art is not only imitation but also the use of mathematical ideas and symmetry in the search for the perfect, the timeless, and contrasting being with becoming. Nature is full of change, decay, and cycles, but art can also search for what is everlasting and the first causes of natural phenomena. Aristotle wrote about the idea of [[four causes]] in nature. The first, the [[formal cause]], is like a blueprint, or an immortal idea. The second cause is the material cause, or what a thing is made out of. The third cause is the efficient cause, that is, the process and the agent by which the thing is made. The fourth, the final cause, is the good, or the purpose and end of a thing, known as ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]''.

Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' is often referred to as the counterpart to this Platonic conception of poetry. ''Poetics'' is his treatise on the subject of mimesis. Aristotle was not against literature as such; he stated that human beings are mimetic beings, feeling an urge to create texts (art) that reflect and represent reality.

Aristotle considered it important that there be a certain distance between the work of art on the one hand and life on the other; we draw knowledge and consolation from tragedies only because they do not happen to us. Without this distance, tragedy could not give rise to [[catharsis]]. However, it is equally important that the text causes the audience to identify with the characters and the events in the text, and unless this identification occurs, it does not touch us as an audience. Aristotle holds that it is through "simulated representation", mimesis, that we respond to the acting on the stage which is conveying to us what the characters feel, so that we may [[empathy|empathise]] with them in this way through the mimetic form of dramatic roleplay. It is the task of the dramatist to produce the tragic enactment in order to accomplish this empathy by means of what is taking place on stage.

In short, catharsis can only be achieved if we see something that is both recognisable and distant. Aristotle argued that literature is more interesting as a means of learning than history, because history deals with specific facts that have happened, and which are contingent, whereas literature, although sometimes based on history, deals with events that could have taken place or ought to have taken place.

Aristotle thought of drama as being "an imitation of an action" and of [[tragedy]] as "falling from a higher to a lower [[Estates of the realm|estate]]" and so being removed to a less ideal situation in more ''tragic'' circumstances than before. He posited the [[fictional character|characters]] in tragedy as being better than the average human being, and those of comedy as being worse.

Michael Davis, a translator and commentator of Aristotle writes:
{{cquote|At first glance, mimesis seems to be a stylizing of reality in which the ordinary features of our world are brought into focus by a certain exaggeration, the relationship of the imitation to the object it imitates being something like the relationship of dancing to walking. Imitation always involves selecting something from the continuum of experience, thus giving boundaries to what really has no beginning or end. ''Mimêsis'' involves a framing of reality that announces that what is contained within the frame is not simply real. Thus the more "real" the imitation the more fraudulent it becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis (1993, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Contrast to diegesis====
It was also Plato and Aristotle who contrasted mimesis with [[diegesis]] (Greek διήγησις). Mimesis ''shows'', rather than ''tells'', by means of directly represented action that is enacted. Diegesis, however, is the ''telling'' of the [[narrative|story]] by a narrator; the author narrates action indirectly and describes what is in the characters' minds and emotions. The narrator may speak as a particular character or may be the "invisible narrator" or even the "all-knowing narrator" who speaks from above in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.

In Book&amp;nbsp;III of his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;373 BCE), [[Plato]] examines the style of poetry (the term includes comedy, [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry|epic]] and [[lyric poetry]]):&lt;ref&gt;An [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt etext of Plato's ''Republic''] is available from [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/150 Project Gutenberg]. The most relevant section is the following: "You are aware, I suppose, that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present, or to come? / Certainly, he replied. / And narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of the two? / [...] / And this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes? / Of course. / Then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation? / Very true. / Or, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then again the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration." (Plato, Republic, Book&amp;nbsp;III.)&lt;/ref&gt; All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the [[dithyramb]] is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in [[epic poetry]]. When reporting or narrating, "the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else"; when imitating, the poet produces an "assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture".&lt;ref&gt;Plato, [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/repub11.txt ''Republic''], Book&amp;nbsp;III.&lt;/ref&gt; In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as himself or herself.&lt;ref&gt;See also Pfister (1977, 2–3) and Elam: "classical narrative is always oriented towards an explicit ''there and then'', towards an imaginary 'elsewhere' set in the past and which has to be evoked for the reader through predication and description. Dramatic worlds, on the other hand, are presented to the spectator as 'hypothetically actual' constructs, since they are 'seen' in progress 'here and now' without narratorial mediation. [...] This is not merely a technical distinction but constitutes, rather, one of the cardinal principles of a poetics of the drama as opposed to one of narrative fiction. The distinction is, indeed, implicit in [[Aristotle]]'s differentiation of representational modes, namely ''[[Mimesis#Mimesis in contrast to diegesis|diegesis]]'' (narrative description) versus ''mimesis'' (direct imitation)" (1980, 110–1).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle argues that kinds of poetry (the term includes drama, flute music, and [[lyre]] music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their ''medium'', according to their ''objects'', and according to their ''mode'' or ''manner'' (section&amp;nbsp;I); "For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality, as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us" (section&amp;nbsp;III).

Though they conceive of mimesis in quite different ways, its relation with diegesis is identical in Plato's and Aristotle's formulations.

In [[ludology]], mimesis is sometimes used to refer to the self-consistency of a represented world, and the availability of in-game rationalisations for elements of the gameplay. In this context, mimesis has an associated grade: highly self-consistent worlds that provide explanations for their puzzles and game mechanics are said to display a higher degree of mimesis. This usage can be traced back to the essay "Crimes Against Mimesis".&lt;ref name=crimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |title=Crimes Against Mimesis |accessdate=2006-12-17 |last=Giner-Sorolla |first=Roger |date=April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050619081931/http://www.geocities.com/aetus_kane/writing/cam.html |archivedate=19 June 2005}} This is a reformatted version of a set of articles originally posted to Usenet:

===Dionysian ''imitatio''===
{{main article|Dionysian imitatio}}
'''Dionysian imitatio''' is the influential [[literary method]] of imitation as formulated by Greek author [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the 1st century BCE, which conceived it as technique of [[rhetoric]]: emulating, adaptating, reworking and enriching a source text by an earlier author.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"&gt;Ruthven (1979) pp. 103–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dionysius' concept marked a significant depart from the concept of ''mimesis'' formulated by [[Aristotle]]'s in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with "imitation of nature" instead of the "imitation of other authors".&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt; Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' ''imitatio'' and discarded Aristotle's ''mimesis''.&lt;ref name="Ruthven79"/&gt;

==Samuel Taylor Coleridge==
Mimesis, or imitation, as he referred to it, was a crucial concept for [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s theory of the [[imagination]]. Coleridge begins his thoughts on imitation and poetry from Plato, Aristotle, and [[Philip Sidney]], adopting their concept of imitation of nature instead of other writers. His middling{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} departure from the earlier thinkers lies in his arguing that art does not reveal a unity of essence through its ability to achieve sameness with nature. Coleridge claims:
{{quote|[T]he composition of a poem is among the imitative arts; and that imitation, as opposed to copying, consists either in the interfusion of the SAME throughout the radically DIFFERENT, or the different throughout a base radically the same.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, S.T. (1983) ''Biographia Literaria.'' v.1 eds. James Engell and W. Jackson Bate. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|0-691-09874-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Here, Coleridge opposes imitation to copying, the latter referring to [[William Wordsworth]]'s notion that poetry should duplicate nature by capturing actual speech. Coleridge instead argues that the unity of essence is revealed precisely through different materialities and media. Imitation, therefore, reveals the sameness of processes in nature.

==Luce Irigaray==
The Belgian feminist [[Luce Irigaray]] used the term to describe a form of resistance where women imperfectly imitate stereotypes about themselves so as to show up these stereotypes and undermine them.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/irigaray.htm#SH4a].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mimesis and Alterity'' (1993), the [[anthropologist]] [[Michael Taussig]] examines the way that people from one culture adopt another's nature and culture (the process of mimesis) at the same time as distancing themselves from it (the process of [[alterity]]). He describes how a legendary tribe, the "white Indians", or [[Kuna (people)|Cuna]], have adopted in various representations figures and images reminiscent of the white people they encountered in the past (without acknowledging doing so).

Taussig, however, criticises anthropology for reducing yet another culture, that of the Cuna, for having been so impressed by the exotic technologies of the whites that they raised them to the status of gods. To Taussig this [[reductionism]] is suspect, and he argues this from both sides in his ''Mimesis and Alterity'' to see values in the [[anthropologist]]s' perspective while simultaneously defending the independence of a lived culture from the perspective of anthropological reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Taussig, 1993:47, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

==René Girard==
In ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World'' (1978), [[René Girard#Mimetic desire|René Girard]] posits that human behavior is based upon mimesis, and that imitation can engender pointless conflict. Girard notes the productive potential of competition: "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that we have all the amazing achievements of the modern world," but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=René|last=Girard|title=Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World|publisher=Stanford University Press|date=1987|pages=7, 26, 307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3199">[[Particle physics]], which deals with the interactions of elementary particles at high energies, is an important component of [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of the [[early universe]], when the universe was dominated by radiation and its average energy density was very high. Because of this, [[pair production]], [[scattering]] processes and [[Particle decay|decay]] of unstable particles are important in cosmology, and the interface between particle physics and cosmology is sometimes referred to as '''particle cosmology'''.

As a thumb rule, a scattering or a decay process is cosmologically important in a certain cosmological epoch if its relevant time scale is smaller or even to the time scale of the universe expansion, which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{H}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; being the time-dependent [[Hubble parameter]]. This is roughly equal to the age of the universe at that time.

For example, the [[pion]] has a [[mean lifetime|lifetime]] of about 26 [[nanosecond]]s. This means that particle physics processes involving pions did not take place until roughly that much time passed since the start of the [[Big Bang]].

Cosmological observations of phenomena such as the [[cosmic microwave background]] and the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|cosmic abundance of elements]], together with the predictions of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, place constraints on the conditions of the early universe. The success of the Standard Model at explaining these observations provides a confirmation of its validity outside of laboratory conditions. In addition, phenomena extrapolated from cosmological observations, such as [[dark matter]] and [[CP-violation]], suggest a need for physics that goes [[beyond the Standard Model]].

'''Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano''' is a [[Venice|Venetian]] company that produces [[glass art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Decorative Arts | first = Philippe | last = Garner | publisher = Galahad Books | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-88365-641-8 | page = 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably Roman murrine, [[mosaic]]s and [[chandelier]]s.

The company was formed in 1919 by a merger of Pauly &amp; C (founded 1902) and the Compagnia di Venezia e Murano (founded 1866). It has since expanded in 1932 with the acquisition of MVM Cappellin and in 1990 by the addition of the drawings and back catalogues of Toso Vetri d’Arte. The company maintains retail showrooms as well as exhibiting antiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Venetian Glass: The Nancy Olnick and Giorgio Spanu Collection | first = David Revere | last = McFadden |author2=Susan Sacks |author3=Marino Barovier |author4=Susanne K.

==History==

===Compagnia di Venezia e Murano===
Compagnia di Venezia e Murano began as [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati &amp;C.]] in London in 1866 under the direction of Vicenza attorney [[Antonio Salviati]] and with the backing of two British men: archaeologist [[Austen Henry Layard]] and antiquarian Sir William Drake. The company was dedicated to using ancient techniques and utilized master glassblowers in its efforts to do so. It called in specialists from other fields like [[goldsmith]]ing and [[engraver|engraving]] to ensure authenticity and employed artist [[Giuseppe Devers]] to teach the techniques of enamelling and heat-applied glass gilding to company artisans. Archaeologist Layard was particularly interested in the mosaic glass techniques of Roman and pre-Roman artists, and he spent years personally overseeing the work of the company's technicians and glassblowers in attempting to revive those techniques. In 1872, the company was successful, managing to replicate the type of glass commonly known as "murrina" (plural, "murrine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Studio Glass, 1960-1990: An Interpretive Study | first = Martha Drexler | last = Lynn | publisher = Hudson Hills | year = 2004 | isbn = 1-55595-239-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b4KhNlxnyOEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=murrina+glass&amp;as_brr=3 | page = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Il Museo vetrario di Murano e la annessa Scuola di disegno negli anni 1882-1884 |author=G. M. Urbani de Ghheltof | publisher = Premiato Stab.

The company was renamed Venice and Murano Glass and Mosaic Company Limited in 1872, and, in 1877, Layard purchased Salviati's interest so that Salviati could pursue other interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Art &amp; design in Europe and America, 1800-1900 | first = Simon | last = Jervis |author2=Albert Museum | publisher = E.P. Dutton | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-525-48352-7 | page = 224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company quickly earned a reputation for quality original glass art and reproductions as well as its many mural mosaics in [[Great Britain]] and elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 238, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the murrine produced by Compagnia di Venezia e Murano was included in its exhibit at the International Exhibition in Paris, which was the chief attraction in Italian glass.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; In its observations of the display, the United States Commission to the Paris exposition commented not only on "Roman murrhine glass", but also particularly on the mural glass mosaics, the "perfection of which" had "engaged the earnest attention of the company."&lt;ref&gt;Blake, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaics produced by the company during the time period are still in existence in diverse areas such as Gonville and Caius College Chapel in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; [[St Paul's Within the Walls]] in Rome, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Westminster Cathedral]] in London, [[Old South Church]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] the [[Chamberlain Memorial]] in Birmingham, [[Palazzo Barbarigo]] and the [[Senate House (Kingston, New York)|Senate House]] rooms in the United States. The last specimen, a portrait of [[Abraham Lincoln]], was produced and donated in 1866.

Through the last years of the 19th century, Compagnia di Venezia e Murano took part in many other displays. Prior to the 1878 exhibition in Paris, it had shown at the [[Maritime Exhibition]] in Naples and the Trieste Exhibition in 1871 and at the International Exhibition in Vienna in 1873, where it won 13 prizes for decorative arts. It unveiled a new focus in 1881 with the display of the first of its glass phoenixes at the National Exhibition in Milan. It exported several thousand works for display at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, also setting up a [[kiln]] so that the public could observe the company's glass blowing techniques. In 1895, it exhibited at the first [[Venice Biennale]] (an event at which it would also feature later), with artisan Vincenzo Moretti taking prizes and artisan Attilio Spaccarelli earning special note for his engraving.

1900 saw a change in the company when its British owners sold their interest to a businessman from Venice named Tosolini, who was the owner of shops in St. Mark's Square. Under Tosoloni's ownership, the company stopped production in 1909, though it continued commercial distribution at St. Mark's Square.

===Merger with Pauly &amp; C===
[[File:Ponte dei consorzi.JPG|thumb|upright|Ponte dei Consorzi, front entry of Palazzo Cappello Trevisan in Venice.]]
Pauly &amp; C was formed in 1903 by Emilio Pauly, Alessandro Hirscber Hellman, Vittorio Emanuele Toldo and Ernesto Graziadei, opening showrooms in [[Palazzo Trevisan Cappello]], which would remain the headquarters of the company until its closure in 2007 for restoration. In 1919, Pauly &amp; C. and Compagnia di Venezia e Murano were both purchased by the Milan Società Anonima Sanitaria, which resold them the following year to Gaetano Ceschina of [[Milan]]. The newly merged company, retitled to its present name, continued display in its previous locations of St. Mark's Square and the Palazzo Trevisan Cappello. In 1925, the merged company resumed production of glassworks on Murano and began exhibiting again at the Monza Tirennale.

===Post-merger growth and development===
The company grew in 1933 with the acquisition of Maestri Vetrai Muranesi Cappellin, or MVM Cappellin, a glass company formed in 1925 by Paolo [[Venini]] and Giacomo Cappellin, which transferred to them rights to the works and designs of the MVM Cappellin artists such as [[Vittorio Zecchin]] and [[Carlo Scarpa]]. The company expanded into commissioned chandeliers, with notable pieces from the period being placed in such locations as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] in Rome; the [[Vatican Palace]], and the [[Amalienborg Palace|Royal Palace in Copenhagen]]. More recently, interior lighting has been designed for such places as the Palazzo Bezzi in [[Ravenna]] and the Al Assawi family palace. In 1990, the company again expanded with the acquisition of [[Toso Vetri d’Arte]] glassworks.

===Transition===
Ceschina sold his interest in the company in 1963 to the Barbon family, who retained it until 1976, when they sold to Andrea Boscaro. Boscaro owned the company for almost 30 years before 2005.

==Artistic associations==
The company has a long history of association with international artisans. In the period following [[World War II|the second World War]], the company undertook long-term associations with master glassblowers [[Anzolo Fuga]] and [[Alfredo Barbini]], engraver [[Francesco Andolfato]] and painter [[Enzo Scarpa]]. Shorter associations include sculptor [[Napoleone Martinuzzi]] in the 1960s, painter [[Libero Vitali]] in 1971, architect [[Franz Prati]] between 1996 and 1997, and fashion designer [[Romeo Gigli]] in 1997. In the later 1990s, the company also featured exclusive designs by [[Heinz Oestergaard]], [[Maria Teresa Lorella Gnutti]] and [[Berit Johansson]], whose association with the company persisted. Since the turn of the century, associations have included Venetian sculptor [[Livio de Marchi]] and Chinese artist [[Xiao Fan Ru]].

==Museum display==
Glass art produced by Pauly &amp; C. – Compagnia Venezia Murano is on display in a number of museums. Among them:

*The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]], UK
*The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], USA
*The [[Cantor Arts Center]] at [[Stanford University]], California
*The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in New York, USA

{{About|philosophical anthropology|other uses|Anthropology (disambiguation)}}

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' or the perfect man by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]
'''Philosophical anthropology''', sometimes called '''anthropological philosophy''',&lt;ref&gt;Fikentscher (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h8PxF5BvtIAC&amp;pg=PA74 pp.74, 89]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer (1944)&lt;/ref&gt; is a discipline dealing with questions of [[metaphysics]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of the human person, and interpersonal relationships.

==History==

===Ancient Christian writers: Augustine of Hippo===
{{Main|Christian anthropology}}
[[Augustine of Hippo]] was one of the first Christian [[Late Latin|ancient Latin]] authors with a very clear anthropological vision,{{Request quotation |date= February 2012}} although it is not clear if he had any influence on [[Max Scheler]], the founder of philosophical anthropology as an independent discipline, nor on any of the major philosophers that followed him. Augustine has been cited by [[Husserl]] and [[Heidegger]] as one of the early writers to inquire on time-consciousness and the role of ''seeing'' in the feeling of "Being-in-the-world".&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. ''Phenomenology of Internal Time-Consciousness.'' Tr. James S. Churchill. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1964, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, ''Being and Time'' Trs. Macquarrie &amp; Robinson. New York: Harpers, 1964. 171. Articulating on how "Being-in-the-world" is described through thinking about ''seeing'': "The remarkable priority of 'seeing' was noticed particularly by Augustine, in connection with his Interpretation of ''concupiscentia''." Heidegger, quoting the ''Confessions'': "Seeing belongs properly to the eyes. But we even use this word 'seeing' for the other senses when we devote them to cognizing...  We not only say, 'See how that shines', ... 'but we even say, 'See how that sounds'".&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine saw the human being as a perfect unity of two substances: soul and body.&lt;ref&gt;Gianni (1965), pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; He was much closer in this anthropological view to [[Aristotle]] than to [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrics (1954), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MAS&gt;Massuti, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; In his late treatise [[s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume III/Moral Treatises of St. Augustin/On Care to Be Had for the Dead/Section 5|On Care to Be Had for the Dead]] sec. 5 (420 CE) he insisted that the body is essential part of the human person:
{{quotation |In no wise are the bodies themselves to be spurned. (...) For these pertain not to ornament or aid which is applied from without, but to the very nature of man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''De cura pro mortuis gerenda'' [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 41, 627 [13–22]; PL 40, 595: ''Nullo modo ipsa spernenda sunt corpora. (...) Haec enim non-ad ornamentum vel adiutorium, quod adhibetur extrinsecus, sed ad ipsam naturam hominis pertinent''; ''Contra Faustum'', 22.27; PL 44,418.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Augustine's favourite figure to describe ''body-soul'' unity is marriage: ''caro tua, coniux tua – your body is your wife''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''Enarrationes in psalmos'', 143, 6; [[Corpus Christianorum |CCL]] 40, 2077 [46] – 2078 [74]); ''De utilitate ieiunii'', 4, 4–5; CCL 46, 234–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the two elements were in perfect harmony. After the [[Augustine of Hippo#Original sin|fall of humanity]] they are now experiencing dramatic combat between one another.

They are two categorically different things: the body is a three-dimensional object composed of the four elements, whereas the soul has no spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''De quantitate animae'' 1.2; 5.9&lt;/ref&gt; Soul is a kind of substance, participating in reason, fit for ruling the body.&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustine de Hippo | Augustine, Aurelius de Hippo]], ''De quantitate animae'' 13.12: ''Substantia quaedam rationis particeps, regendo corpori accomodata''.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine was not preoccupied, as Plato and [[Descartes]] were, with going too much into detail in his efforts to explain the [[metaphysics]] of the soul-body union. It sufficed for him to admit that they were metaphysically distinct. To be a human is to be a composite of soul and body, and that the soul is superior to the body. The latter statement is grounded in his hierarchical classification of things into those that merely exist, those that exist and live, and those that exist, live, and have intelligence or reason.&lt;ref&gt;''[[De libero arbitrio (Augustine)|On the free will]]'' (''De libero arbitrio'') 2.3.7–6.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann, p. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

According to N. Blasquez, Augustine's dualism of substances of the body and soul doesn't stop him from seeing the unity of body and soul as a substance itself.&lt;ref name=MAS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''El concepto del substantia segun san Agustin'', pp. 305–350.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Aristotle and other ancient philosophers, he defined man as a ''rational mortal animal'' – ''animal rationale mortale''.&lt;ref&gt;''De ordine'', II, 11.31; CCL 29, 124 [18]; [[Patrologia Latina|PL]] 32,1009; De quantitate animae, 25, 47–49; CSEL 89, 190–194; PL 32, 1062–1063&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Couturier (1954), p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern period===
Philosophical anthropology as a kind of thought, before it was founded as a distinct philosophical discipline in the 1920s, emerged as post-[[medieval]] thought striving for emancipation from [[Christian religion]] and Aristotelic tradition.&lt;ref name="Apostolopoulou1992p49"&gt;Apostolopoulou, ''Georgia The Problem of Religion in Helmuth Plessner's Philosophical Anthropology'', in Reimer, A. James and Siebert, Rudolf J. (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8RAQAAIAAJ ''The Influence of the Frankfurt school on contemporary theology: critical theory and the future of religion''], pp.42–66. Quotation from p.49: {{quotation|Philosophical anthropology is a kind of thought arising in times of crisis. The main anthropologists, Max Scheler and Helmuth Plessner, share the same opinion [that it] has appeared as a consequence of the shaking of the Middle Age's order, the roots of which were Greek tradition and Christian religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this liberation, characteristic of [[modernity]], has been the [[Cartesian skepticism]] formulated by [[Descartes]] in the first two of his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641).

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) taught the first lectures on anthropology in the European academic world. He specifically developed a conception of ''pragmatic anthropology'', according to which the human being is studied as a free agent. At the same time, he conceived of his anthropology as an empirical, not a strictly philosophical discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Both his philosophical and his anthropological work has been one of the influences in the field during the 19th and 20th century.&lt;ref name="Grolier 1981p768"&gt;Grolier (1981) [https://books.google.com/books?id=SesZAAAAMAAJ ''The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 21''] p. 768&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buber1943PM"/&gt; After Kant, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] is sometimes considered the next most important influence and founder of anthropological philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Poolla Tirupati Raju (1966) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3cYtAAAAYAAJ ''The concept of man: a study in comparative philosophy''] p. 490 {{quotation|Feuerbach interpreted philosophical anthropologism as the summary of the entire previous development of philosophical thought. Feuerbach was thus the father of the comprehensive system of anthropological philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Deutsch Kornblatt, Richard F. Gustafson (1996) ''Russian religious thought'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=AqwGUM4tFoEC&amp;pg=PA140 p. 140] quotation: {{quotation|In modern thought, according to Buber, Feuerbach was the most important contributor to philosophical anthropology, next to Kant, because he posited Man as the exclusive object of philosophy...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, an important contribution came from [[post-kantian]] [[German idealist]]s like [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and [[Hegel]],&lt;ref name="Grolier 1981p768"/&gt; as well from [[Søren Kierkegaard]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== Philosophical anthropology as independent discipline ===
Since its development in the 1920s, in the milieu of Germany [[Weimar culture]], philosophical anthropology has been turned into a philosophical discipline, competing with the other traditional sub-disciplines of [[epistemology]], ethics, [[metaphysics]], [[aesthetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Fischer (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NfTwdJYsx-AC&amp;pg=PA64 p.64], quotation: {{quotation|Ende der 1920er Jahre prominent geworden, weil damals aus verschiedenen Denkrich- tungen und Motiven die Frage nach dem Menschen in die Mitte der philosophischen Problematik rückte. Die philosophische Anthropologie wurde so zu einer neuen Disziplin in der Philosophie neben den eingeführten Subdisziplinen der Erkenntnistheorie, der Ethik, der Metaphysik, der Ästhetik}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the attempt to unify disparate ways of understanding behaviour of humans as both creatures of their [[social environment]]s and creators of their own [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. Although the majority of philosophers throughout the [[history of philosophy]] can be said to have a distinctive "[[anthropology]]" that undergirds their thought, philosophical anthropology itself, as a ''specific discipline'' in philosophy, arose within the later modern period as an outgrowth from developing methods in philosophy, such as phenomenology and [[existentialism]]. The former, which draws its energy from methodical reflection on human experience (first person perspective) as from the philosopher's own personal experience, naturally aided the emergence of philosophical explorations of human nature and the [[human condition]].

===1920s Germany===
[[Max Scheler]], from 1900 till 1920 had been a follower of [[Husserl]]'s phenomenology, the hegemonic form of philosophy in Germany at the time. Scheler sought to apply Husserl's phenomenological approach to different topics. From 1920 Scheler laid the foundation for philosophical anthropology as a philosophical discipline, competing with phenomenology and other philosophic disciplines. Husserl and [[Martin Heidegger]] (1889–1976), were the two most authoritative philosophers in Germany at the time, and their criticism to philosophical anthropology and Scheler have had a major impact on the discipline.

Scheler defined the human being not so much as a "[[Rationality|rational]] animal" (as has traditionally been the case since [[Aristotle]]) but essentially as a [[love|loving]] [[being]]. He breaks down the traditional [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of the human person, and describes the personal being with a [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] structure of [[lived body]], [[soul]], and [[spirit]]. Love and [[hatred]] are not [[psychological]] [[emotions]], but [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[intention]]al acts of the person, which he [[Categorization|categorises]] as "intentional feelings."{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Scheler based his philosophical anthropology in a Christian metaphysics of the spirit.&lt;ref name= "Wilkoszewska2004p129"&gt;Wilkoszewska, Krystyna (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHY5Q4lgY4sC&amp;pg=PA129 ''Deconstruction and reconstruction: the Central European Pragmatist Forum''], Volume 2, p.129&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmuth Plessner]] would later emancipate philosophical anthropology from Christianity.&lt;ref name="Wilkoszewska2004p129" /&gt;

[[Helmuth Plessner]] and [[Arnold Gehlen]] have been influenced by Scheler, and they are the three major representatives of philosophical anthropology as a movement.

===From the 1940s===
[[Ernst Cassirer]], a neo-Kantian philosopher, has been the most influential source for the definition and development of the field from the 1940s till the 1960s.&lt;ref name= "Schilpp67p73"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Schilpp | year = 1967 | title = The philosophy of Martin Buber | page = 73 |quote=It was a neo-Kantian philosopher, Ernst Cassirer, who perhaps more than anyone else contributed to the definition and development of philosophical anthropology in recent decades. Particularly relevant here is Cassirer's conception of man as a symbolizing and mythologizing animal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly influential has been Cassirer's description of man as a ''[[symbolic animal]]'',&lt;ref name= "Schilpp67p73" /&gt; which has been reprised in the 1960s by [[Gilbert Durand]], scholar of [[symbolic anthropology]] and the [[Imaginary (sociology) |imaginary]].

In 1953, future pope [[Karol Wojtyla]] based his dissertation thesis on Max Scheler, limiting himself to the works Scheler wrote before rejecting Catholicism and the Judeo-Christian tradition in 1920. Wojtyla used Scheler as an example that phenomenology could be reconciled with Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Anna-Teresa | last = Tymieniecka | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iGONF4dUwOwC | title = Phenomenology world-wide | page = 487| isbn = 9781402000669 | year = 2002 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have argued that Wojtyla influenced philosophical anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Hans | last = Köchler | author-link = Hans Köchler | title = The Phenomenology of Karol Wojtyla.  On the Problem of the Phenomenological Foundation of Anthropology | journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 42 | year = 1982 | pages = 326–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | K.

In the 20th century, other important contributors and influences to philosophical anthropology have been [[Paul Häberlin]] (1878–1960), [[Martin Buber]] (1878–1965),&lt;ref name="Buber1943PM"&gt;{{Citation | last = Buber | first = Martin | author-link = Martin Buber | year = 1943 | title = Das Problem des Menschen |trans-title=The Problem of Man | language = de}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E.R. Dodds]] (1893–1979), [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] (1900–2002), [[Eric Voegelin]] (1901–85), [[Hans Jonas]] (1903–93), [[Josef Pieper]] (1904–97), [[Hans-Eduard Hengstenberg]] (1904–98),{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}} [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–80), [[Joseph Maréchal]] (1878–1944), [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1908–61), [[Paul Ricoeur]] (1913–2005), [[René Girard]] (1923–2015), [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (1929–), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (1930–2002), [[Hans Blumenberg]], [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004), [[Emerich Coreth]] (1919–2006), [[Leonardo Polo]] (1926–2013).

==Anthropology of interpersonal relationships==
A large focus of philosophical anthropology is also interpersonal relationships, as an attempt to unify disparate ways of understanding the behaviour of humans as both creatures of their [[social environment]]s and creators of their own values. It analyses also the [[ontology]] that is in play in human relationships – of which [[intersubjectivity]] is a major theme. Intersubjectivity is the study of how two individuals, subjects, whose experiences and interpretations of the world are radically different understand and relate to each other.

Recently anthropology has begun to shift towards studies of intersubjectivity and other existential/phenomenological themes. Studies of language have also gained new prominence in philosophy and sociology due to language's close ties with the question of intersubjectivity.

===Michael D. Jackson's study of intersubjectivity===
The academic [[Michael Jackson (anthropology)|Michael D. Jackson]] is another important philosophical anthropologist. His research and fieldwork concentrate on existential themes of "being in the world" (''[[Dasein]]'') as well as interpersonal relationships. His methodology challenges traditional anthropology due to its focus on first-person experience. In his most well known book, ''Minima Ethnographica'' which focuses on intersubjectivity and interpersonal relationships, he draws upon his ethnographic fieldwork in order to explore existential theory.

In his latest book, ''Existential Anthropology'', he explores the notion of control, stating that humans anthropomorphize inanimate objects around them in order to enter into an interpersonal relationship with them. In this way humans are able to feel as if they have control over situations that they cannot control because rather than treating the object as an object, they treat it as if it is a rational being capable of understanding their feelings and language. Good examples are prayer to gods to alleviate drought or to help a sick person or cursing at a computer that has ceased to function.

There is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of "traditional" [[mainstream media]] [MSM]) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regards to the [[Leveson Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="lse0"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson: Bloggers vs the Press | website=Media Policy Project | date=7 December 2012 | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/12/07/leveson-bloggers-vs-the-press/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early media institutions==
Before [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in 1450, most information was delivered by town criers, ministers from the pulpit, or bartenders. [[Town criers]] spread information and news including royal edicts, police regulations, important community events and war news. These early methods of communication were often delivered by messengers on foot, and could be easily controlled by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Media History |last=Fellow |first=Anthony |year=2005 |publisher=Michael Rosenberg |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-495-56775-2 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7THGKyvBXScC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=%22town+criers%22+polical+media&amp;ei=3IgcS67kN57IzAT2k5iEDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of the printing press news began to be spread in writing. [[Corantos]], which were semi-regular pamphlets that reported news, are an example of the early politico-media complex. Popular in England, corantos reported mostly foreign news, as the royal government attempted to control what domestic news reached the masses. Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to less political control, and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Catherine.

===Global print media===
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights". United Nations. 2009.

The [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] suggests that even in many first world countries the rights of the press are not fully respected, and that the press is not completely free to investigate or criticize the government, though the situation is far worse in third world or politically unstable nations.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref name="press freedom index"&gt;"Press Freedom Index 2009".

====The West====
[[File:Newspapers-20080928.jpg|thumb|[[Newspapers]], as seen here, are easily available in many parts of the world.]]

Newspapers and magazines do have a back and forth between readers and journalists. Some studies have shown that the print media are more likely to reinforce existing political attitudes of the masses than change them.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly, Caroline. Ross, Karen. “Women and media: international perspectives”. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters Without Borders, an international [[non-governmental organization]] that promotes [[freedom of the press]], produces an annual [[Press Freedom Index]] assessing countries' press freedom. Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said at the release of the 2009 Press Freedom Index, "It is disturbing to see European democracies such as France, Italy and Slovakia fall steadily in the rankings year after year [...] Europe should be setting an example as regards civil liberties. How can you condemn human rights violations abroad if you do not behave irreproachably at home? The Obama effect, which has enabled the United States to recover 16 places in the index, is not enough to reassure us."&lt;ref name="press freedom index"/&gt;

===Struggles===
Where newspapers used to represent an exclusive connection between readers and advertisers, print media must now compete with the power of the entire Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan, Robert. The Krugman Paradox: newspaper websites' inability to generate economically sustainable advertising revenue. New York University. Fall 2008. pg. 18.[http://metaprinter.com/Projects/Robert_Ivan_MAthesis_2008NYU.pdf MA Thesis PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of declining advertising revenue and shrinking audiences, [[print press]] has been described as declining.&lt;ref name="printdecline" /&gt; Today a little more than half of Americans read a newspaper every day. However, a 2004 report notes that 55 million newspapers are still sold daily in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and newsprint still plays a significant role in the politico-media complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|title=Conservative Koch Brothers Turning Focus to Newspapers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/business/media/koch-brothers-making-play-for-tribunes-newspapers.html|accessdate=9 April 2015|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to economic struggles and readership decline, newsprint has also struggled with losing readers' trust. Surveys have found that people tend to trust newspapers less than other news media, in part because they believe that newspaper journalists are "isolated and out of touch" and motivated by commercial interests.&lt;ref name="2004att"&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/public-attitudes/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most people believe their local and national news television stations more than their local and national newspapers.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; The only news medium that people trust less than newspapers is print magazines.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt;

Some{{who|date=June 2013}} have speculated that the youth today are more visually inclined, and are therefore less likely to be influenced by written political news or propaganda.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; One Pew Center study found that 28% of this generation read the paper on a given day, and average only 10 minutes of reading time. [[Harvard]] Professor Thomas Patterson has said: "What's happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation, and the internet is a little of both.

==Radio==

===History of political radio===
[[File:RCA Radiola 25 - raw.jpg|thumb|An [[Radio Corporation of America|RCA]] Radiola, manufactured 1925.]]

The early American radio industry was composed of commercial shipping companies that used radio for navigation, and amateur radio enthusiasts, who built radios at home.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Douglas B. Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States. pg 26. The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This mixture of military, industry and community went unregulated until the [[Radio Act of 1912]], which required all ships to use radio communication and keep a constant radio watch, amateur users to be licensed, and began regulating the use of wavelengths for radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Regulate Radio Communication, August 13, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; This act represents one of the earliest interactions between the government and the radio media and also set a precedent for later radio legislation,{{OR|date=June 2013}} including the [[Radio Act of 1927]], which established the [[Federal Radio Commission]] and added further regulation to radio users, both commercial and amateur.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No. 632, February 23, 1927, 69th Congress. An Act for the regulation of radio communications, and for other purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation increased again with the American entrance into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson ordered naval control of all radio stations, and ordered that amateurs cease all radio activity. [[Jonathan Reed Winkler]], a noted WWI historian, said “It was only during World War I that the United States first came to comprehend how a strategic communications network-the collection of submarine telegraph cables, and long-distance radio stations used by a nation for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes- was vital to the global political and economic interests of a great power in the modern world.”&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Jonathan Reed. Nexus: Strategic Communications and American Security in World War I. pg. 2. [[Harvard University Press]]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I radio was introduced to broader civilian audiences when Westinghouse released the Aeriola Jr. in 1919, and the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) released the Radiola in 1920. The Aeriola Jr. and Radiola helped established a new channel for the politico-media complex to enter into thousand of American homes.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} By 1919 the oldest licensed American radio station, KDKA, from Pittsburgh, PA began broadcasting regular music shows, and soon music, educational programming, sports coverage and eventually news coverage became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pgs. 10, 13-16. [[Columbia University Press]]. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of politics quickly caught on across the countries, as stations began covering elections, and reporting news of government actions. The close politico-media complex between government and radio was finalized in 1924{{OR|date=June 2013}} when the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were covered, and candidates made eve of election speeches, the first instance of radio broadcasting that was meant to affect the American political process.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pg. 18. Columbia University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of [[propaganda]]. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as [[Tokyo Rose]].

After WWII and throughout the [[Cold War]] era, Democratic nations used long-range radio waves to broadcast news into countries behind the Iron Curtain or otherwise information-compromised nations. The American international radio program, the [[Voice of America]], founded during World War II, became a critical part of Cold War era "public diplomacy," which aimed to spread democratic values, and popularize American policies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon Robert.

===Modern political radio===
The Golden Age of Radio may have only lasted from 1935–1950, yet radio is still an active medium in the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} Today there is extensive radio programming on politics. One notable example is the [[Rush Limbaugh Show]], which broadcasts the political commentary of Rush Limbaugh, referred to by listeners as "America's Truth Detector," the "Doctor of Democracy," and the "Most Dangerous Man in America."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Rush Limbaugh Show." Premier Radio Networks.

==Film==

===National cinema===
One of film's most powerful political and sociological forms is '''[[national cinema]]''', for which there are entire books for individual countries and varying definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjort, Mette, and Scott MacKenzie, eds. Introduction. ''Cinema and Nation''. By Hjort and MacKenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Through the national cinema, ideological groups within specific countries can construct and reinforce their collective identities through film, as well as the identities of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jimmy. "Is National Cinema Mr. MacGuffin?" International Films The Institute of Communications Studies, [[University of Leeds]], UK. Available at [http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22 Leeds.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, Charles and John A. Hall. "The Sociological Scope of National Cinema." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p.22-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural politics===
Ulf Hedetoft has observed, "In the real world of politics and influence, certain nationalisms, cultures, ideas and interpretations are more transnationally powerful, assertive and successful than others. Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"&gt;Hedetoft, Ulf. "Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its "national-cultural currency" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a "positive admixture" to other countries' cultures and identities or a "model for emulation."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt; He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt;

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"&gt;Furhammar, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

Such British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the "masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

When sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{OR|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"&gt;Furhammar, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the "reality" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI "Operation Abolition," 1960 - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The Führer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.&lt;ref&gt;Furhammar, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in "Breaking into the Movies," is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"&gt;Giroux, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He argues, "We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values."&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"/&gt;

Though feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"/&gt;

===Anti-politics in film===
Despite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to "develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's "[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]" 1939.]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; After the hero of ''[[John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Lindholm and Hall observe that "the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"&gt;Lindholm, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt; Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt;

===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===
While films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

===Role of television in United States presidential elections===
The [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"&gt;Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;

Rick Shenkman also analyzes the media’s impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that "politicians have repeatedly misled voters" by "[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation."&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;
[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]

Through setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation’s political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.&lt;ref name="agenda" /&gt; When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence on religion via television===
In his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in "shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present" in India.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"&gt;Rajagopal, Arvind. "Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India." Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that "television profoundly changes the context of politics".&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;24)&lt;/sup&gt;

The epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/sup&gt; This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.

Central to the BJP’s success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt; This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.

===Television and politics around the world===
In the “Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,” Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation’s television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation’s television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"&gt;Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"/&gt;

Another group who studied the impact of television on politics included Holli Semetko and Patti Valenburg. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are "conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information."&lt;ref&gt;Neuman et al., 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;60&lt;/ref&gt; They set the parameters "in which citizens discuss public events."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;IV&lt;/ref&gt; They are "persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Framing is selecting "some aspects of a perceived reality" to enhance their salience "in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt; Frames are to help audiences "locate, perceive, identify, and label" the flow of information around themGoffman, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;21 and to "narrow the available political alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Semetko"&gt;Semetko, Holli A. and Valenburg, Patti M. “Framing European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.” Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

News frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&amp;nbsp;– such as its organization, content, or structure&amp;nbsp;– make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Price et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;486&lt;/ref&gt; Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;

Like agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis "expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news."&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pan &amp; Kosicki, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;70; emphasis in the original&lt;/ref&gt; The results of Semetko and Valenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt; After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.

==Internet==

===Impact on political media===
The Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&amp;pg=PT350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhap less than flattering, may be 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).

For example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom).

contributing damage to Wikipedia's standing along the way. Boothroyd was forced to step down from the Arbitration Committee, although he claimed he had already asserted his intention to resign.

The impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

[[File:Bill Clinton (square).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bill Clinton]] was the first [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] to utilize the [[Internet]] in a national campaign and to appoint a Director of Email and Electronic Publishing.]]
[[E-mail]] has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in. In a six-month period, at one point, there were half a million e-mails sent to the president and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Media and American Politics |last=Davis |first=Richard |author2=Owen, Diana |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-19-512060-4 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-Ka0nSKaFoC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=New+Media+and+American+Politics#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
The United States [[President of the United States|Presidential]] [[United States presidential election, 1996|campaign]] in 1996 between sitting-President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]] was one of the first campaigns to utilize the Internet on a national level in the US.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

With so many campaigns using the Internet it raises a significant amount of money in a shorter period of time than with any other method. The web sites are set up like advertising sites – there are links to click on to watch ads, information and background on the candidate, photos from the campaign trail, schedules, donation links, etc. E-mail gives a great low-cost way of connecting with the campaign trail and voters.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] United States [[Presidential election]] between [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]], the Internet was extensively utilized by both candidates. [[Facebook]], an Internet social network, was used heavily to give people the ability to support their views and share information with their friends. Both sent out messages daily to promote themselves and the issues at hand, for leverage against the other candidate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Discussion forums===
[[Blogs]] are a type of website, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blogging started to become popular at the start of the millennium, and was used mostly by highly educated, highly paid, males. Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction. Many [[political campaign]]s use this as a stake in monitoring blogs and actively using them to spread information about their candidate.&lt;ref name=Tremayne &gt;{{cite book |title=Blogging, Citizenship, and the future of media |last=Tremayne |first=Mark |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group, LLC |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-97940-4 |page=266 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a6zPnOn9i9oC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet creates a space in which people can voice their opinions and discuss political issues under the protection of anonymity. Some discussion forums are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with discussion forums include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Bias is another issue of online discussion forums because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.&lt;ref name=Tremayne/&gt;

===Electronic government===
An [[e-Government]] is a government that is inter-networked through digital technology for mass media distribution and communication for voters, taxpayers, schools, hospitals, etc. It has been described{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} as a new way to transform government programs by closing the gap between distance and time. This idea has been said to be a more cost effective and convenient way to form programs around the needs of citizens rather than civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netzhausen.de/internet/indage_bureaucracy_final.pdf |title= The Digital Economy: Promise &amp; Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence

In perhaps what is the beginning of the first major reappraisal of the relationship between a political elite/class and the media in a major modern Western PMC, with respect to the enervation of representative political and legal processes and the consequent erosion of and dangers to the public interest in a Western democracy, is captured in excerpts from three contributions to an emergency three-hour debate&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1534 Column 1534]. ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by members of parliament (MPs) in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on the afternoon of the 6 July 2011.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We politicians have colluded for far too long with the media: we rely on them, we seek their favour, and we live and we die politically because of what they write and what they show, and sometimes that means we lack the courage or the spine to stand up when wrong has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Chris Bryant]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1540 Column 1540] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*As MPs, we depend on the media. We like to be liked by them; we need to be liked by them. We depend on the media, and that applies still more to Governments. It is an unavoidable observation that Parliament has behaved with extraordinary cowardice for many years...&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Zac Goldsmith]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1569 Column 1569] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We are faced with a scandal of expanding proportions, including hacking, allegations of interference in police investigations, and claims that payments have been made to officers. To restore faith and trust in the police and the media, we must lock up the guilty, establish a statutory inquiry, shine a cleansing light on the culture of the media and, if necessary, of the police, and implement the reforms necessary to ensure that the privacy of victims and citizens is never intruded on again. It is clear from today’s debate that this is the will of the House, and we are committed to making it happen.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Tom Brake]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0003.htm/#column_1580 Column 1580] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These comments refer to the apparent effects of the relationships between the members of  (the UK) parliament and those that form the [[UK Government]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] and [[News International]] (NI [UK subsidiary of [[News Corporation]] ]) and the influence, expressed as malign, of the latter organization on the former two institutions.

The debate was precipitated by the type of some of the information procurement methods found to have been used by a major British Sunday newspaper (the title is now shut down) – the ''[[News of the World]]'' (was owned by NI). Now known as the (News International) ‘[[News of the World phone hacking affair|phone hacking affair]]’, the consequences&lt;ref&gt;The first major consequence being the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14070856 closure] of the 168 year old title of the ''News of the World'' from Sunday 10 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; for the British PMC and NI (as part of the world’s second largest media empire after [[The Walt Disney Company]]) are likely to be unfolding for some considerable time as new sectors of vulnerable members of British society subjected to the particular malicious practice are brought to light.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Parliamentary turmoil resulted in the UK government instituting a three-pronged public judicial examination into the relations and interactions between the media and the public, the media and the police and the media and the politicians. Known as the [[Leveson Inquiry]], its findings were published November 29, 2012 based on a spread of around eight months (November 2011 to June 2012) of probing into the relationships. While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.&lt;ref name="lse1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse3"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson Round-Up: Over Cosy?

==Noam Chomsky reaction==
Naming (as a 'complex')  points of intersection and apparent cooperative benefit, to some degree, of diverse, nominally independent, areas of public faced activity puts us in danger of missing a much more fundamental and general insight according to linguist and dissident [[Noam Chomsky]]. Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the "two sectors" represent an "innocent fraud")&lt;ref name="galbraith"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May–June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget. That's a very fairly central theme.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has blamed its existence on the [[corporate welfare|"socialization of costs and the privatization of profits"]].

Chomsky discusses the ''[[military-industrial complex]]'' (MIC)&lt;ref name="chomsky1"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Barsamian|title=War Crimes and Imperial Fantasies|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/200408--.htm|work=International Socialist Review|issue=37|date=September–October 2004|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=...the military-industrial complex, as he (Eisenhower) called it, is actually the core of the modern economy. It’s not specifically military.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the "military" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.

Using the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.

Observing the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).

Chomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.

Chomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.

[[Edward S. Herman]] and Chomsky, together, advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' to accomplish this '[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|manufacturing consent]]', showing the ways in which power and money filter the news and enable governments and dominant private interests to integrate the behavior of the citizenry into the structures of the industrial system. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, "All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news."&lt;ref name="orwell"&gt;{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.

Herman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.

Thus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) – a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.&lt;ref name="chomsky2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

The shadow that the corporations cast on the media through advertising (corroboration of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model filters through advertising) was illustrated in the closure of News International's 168-year-old flagship Sunday title, the ''News of the World'', when major advertisers boycotted the paper as a consequence of the 'phone hacking scandal' – the corporations, understandably, not wishing to be seen associated with a paper whose production had been based on frequent engagement in serious criminal activity.&lt;ref name="nowad"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon|last=Rogers|title=Top 50 News of the World advertisers - and what they spend|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/06/news-of-the-world-top-50-advertisers-spend |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Mason|title=Murdoch: the network defeats the hierarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14093772|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011|quote=The ''News of the World'' is closing - at least partly due to a strong campaign to make advertisers drop the title, following the latest phone hacking revelations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chomsky's perspective, then, whatever set of interactions is being named by the term 'politico-media complex' (PMC) simply instantiates the propaganda model to manufacture consent in the service of the industrial system.

'''''Princess''''' (stylized as '''''Prince$$''''') is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television series hosted by [[Gail Vaz-Oxlade]] that premiered in 2010, and ran original programming until 2012 (three seasons). The program is similar in format to her earlier endeavor, ''[[Til Debt Do Us Part]]''; however, rather than helping couples in financial trouble, Vaz-Oxlade assists women who are considered self-indulgent and spoiled.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news |title=Gail Vaz-Oxlade: The accidental guru |author=Sarah Hampson |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/gail-vaz-oxlade-the-accidental-guru/article1424785/ |newspaper= The Globe and Mail |date= 2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants are given weekly challenges, some of which are to help bring the finances and debt under control, while others are meant to help correct the participant's attitude and make amends to their friends and relatives. At the end of six weeks, Vaz-Oxlade gives the participant a cheque for an amount up to $5,000, based upon Vaz-Oxlade's assessment of the participant's success in each of the challenges.

In the United States, the show airs as reruns on the cable channel [[Ion Life]].

'''Psychological theories of magic''' treat magic as a personal phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, as opposed to a social phenomenon serving a collective purpose.  

==Theories==
===Psychosis===

Among the earliest psychological theories is the psychosis theory, advanced by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S.  Totem and taboo: Resemblances between the psychic lives of savages and neurotics.  London: Routledge Kegan Paul (1960).  (Original work published 1913).&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, “primitive man” is not a rational being, and in fact [[magical thinking]] bears a strong resemblance to neuroses. However, this conclusion has come into question, as more recent psychological theory acknowledges that psychological testing does not cross cultures with complete accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, H., Reisberg, D., &amp; Gross, J.  Psychology, 7th edition.  New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Co (2007). &lt;/ref&gt; 

===Bad science===
In contrast, the “bad science” model claims that primitive man is rational, and magical beliefs come into existence as he tries to explain puzzling phenomena without enough information.  According to this theory, the magician is an early form of scientist who merely lacks adequate data.  In [[Edward Burnett Tylor]]’s version of this theory, the magician’s folly is in mistaking an ideal connection for a real one; the magician believes that thematically-linked items can influence one another by virtue of their similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans-Pritchard, E.E.  Theories of Primitive Religion.  Oxford: Oxford University Press (1977), p.p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Azande]] rub crocodile teeth on banana plants to make them fruitful (because crocodile teeth grow continuously).  The property of [[fertility]] can spread from a symbol of fertility (the crocodile tooth) to the intended target (the banana tree).  Michael F. Brown observes that many Aguaruna taboos can be understood as preventing undesired connections. 

===Symbolic action===
The symbolic action theory understands magic as a course of action taken when there exists an emotional (psychological) need for action, but no practical option exists. In [[R.R. Marett]]’s example, it is a magical action when a man, betrayed by his mistress, gathers photographs of her and burns them.&lt;ref&gt;R.R. Marett.  The Threshold of Religion, 2nd edition.  (1914).  Summary courtesy of Evans-Pritchard, Theories of Primitive Religion, p.p. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation presents a modern analog of the [[voodoo doll]].  As Marett describes, if the emotional situation proves common enough, the response becomes a socially-codified norm which outsiders understand as magic and which Marett labels “developed magic”.  Claude Lévi-Strauss&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''The Effectiveness of Symbols.''&lt;/ref&gt; and Ariel Glucklich&lt;ref&gt;Glucklich, Ariel. ''The End of Magic.'' New York: Oxford University Press (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; expand upon symbolic theory, positing that magic can serve as a form of psychotherapy or [[New Age]] science,  accomplishing real results by what amounts to the [[placebo effect]]. The effects of such magic would be made real through its effect on the individual person as demonstrated in their life and actions.

===Anxiety relief===
According to theories of anxiety relief and control, people turn to magical beliefs when there exists a sense of uncertainty and potential danger and little to do about it.  Magic is used to restore a sense of control.  In support of this theory, research indicates that superstitious behavior is invoked more often in high stress situations, especially by people with a greater desire for control.&lt;ref&gt;Keinan, Giora.  ''The effects of stress and desire for control on superstitious behavior.'' Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin Vol. 28, No. 1.  Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc. (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that one reason (but not necessarily the only reason) for the persistence of magic rituals is that the ritual activates vigilance-precaution systems – that is to say, that the rituals prompt their own use by creating a feeling of insecurity and then proposing themselves as precautions.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal Boyer]] and Pierre Liénard propose that the shape rituals take results from goal demotion and attentional focus on lower level representation.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, Pascal and Pierre Liénard.  ''Ritual behavior in obsessive and normal individuals.''  Association for Psychological Science (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Levels of representation were previously described by J.M. Zacks and [[Barbara Tversky]].&lt;ref&gt;Zacks, J.M. and B. Tversky.  ''Event structure in perception and conception.''  Psychological Bulletin, 127, 3-21.  (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; At the lowest level are simple gestures (such as putting the left foot in a shoe).  At the mid-level are behavioral episodes (such as putting one’s shoes on). At the highest level are scripts (such as getting dressed to go out). Ordinarily, people describe and recall behavior in terms of the middle level of behavioral episodes{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}.  In studies of [[obsessive-compulsive]] rituals, focus shifts to the lower level of gestures, resulting in goal demotion. For example, an obsessive-compulsive cleaning ritual may overemphasize the order, direction, and number of wipes used to clean the surface.  The goal becomes less important than the actions used to achieve the goal, with the implication that magic rituals can persist without efficacy because the intent is lost within the act. Debate remains as to whether studies of obsessive-compulsive rituals can be extended to describe other kinds of rituals.

&lt;/score&gt;|width=390|caption=The [[A minor]] melodic minor scale, ascending and descending}}In [[music theory]], a '''scale''' is any set of musical [[note (music)|notes]] ordered by [[fundamental frequency]] or [[pitch (music)|pitch]]. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a  descending scale. Some scales contain different pitches when ascending than when descending, for example, the [[melodic minor scale]].

Often, especially in the context of the [[common practice period]], most or all of the [[melody]] and [[harmony]] of a [[musical work]] is built using the notes of a single scale, which can be conveniently represented on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] with a standard [[key signature]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward, Bruce and Saker, Marilyn Nadine (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', seventh edition: vol. 1, p. 25. Boston: McGraw-Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the principle of [[octave]] equivalence, scales are generally considered to span a single octave, with higher or lower octaves simply repeating the pattern. A musical scale represents a division of the octave space into a certain number of scale steps, a scale step being the recognizable distance (or [[interval (music)|interval]]) between two successive notes of the scale.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Michael (2013). ''Musical Scales of the World'', pp. 2–3. The Note Tree. {{ISBN|978-0-9575470-0-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no need for scale steps to be equal within any scale and, particularly as demonstrated by [[microtonal music]], there is no limit to how many notes can be injected within any given musical interval.

A measure of the width of each scale step provides a method to classify scales. For instance, in a chromatic scale each scale step represents a [[semitone]] interval, while a [[major scale]] is defined by the interval pattern T–T–S–T–T–T–S, where T stands for [[whole tone]] (an interval spanning two semitones), and S stands for semitone. Based on their interval patterns, scales are put into categories including [[diatonic scale|diatonic]], [[chromatic scale|chromatic]], [[major scale|major]], [[minor scale|minor]], and others.

A specific scale is defined by its characteristic interval pattern and by a special note, known as its first [[Degree (music)|degree]] (or [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]). The tonic of a scale is the note selected as the beginning of the octave, and therefore as the beginning of the adopted interval pattern. Typically, the name of the scale specifies both its tonic and its interval pattern. For example, [[C major]] indicates a major scale with a C tonic.

==Background==

===Scales, steps, and intervals===
[[File:Major scale in the chromatic circle.png|thumb|Diatonic scale in the [[chromatic circle]]]]

Scales are typically listed from low to high pitch. Most scales are ''[[octave]]-repeating'', meaning their pattern of notes is the same in every octave (the [[Bohlen–Pierce scale]] is one exception). An octave-repeating scale can be represented as a circular arrangement of pitch classes, ordered by increasing (or decreasing) pitch class. For instance, the increasing C major scale is C–D–E–F–G–A–B–[C], with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note, and the decreasing C major scale is C–B–A–G–F–E–D–[C], with the bracket indicating an octave lower than the first note in the scale.

The distance between two successive notes in a scale is called a [[Degree (music)|scale step]].

The notes of a scale are numbered by their steps from the root of the scale. For example, in a C major scale the first note is C, the second D, the third E and so on. Two notes can also be numbered in relation to each other: C and E create an interval of a third (in this case a major third); D and F also create a third (in this case a minor third).

===Pitch===
A single scale can be manifested at many different pitch levels. For example, a C major scale can be started at C4 (middle C; see [[scientific pitch notation]]) and ascending an octave to C5; or it could be started at C6, ascending an octave to C7. As long as all the notes can be played, the [[octave]] they take on can be altered.

}
&lt;/score&gt;|width=350|caption=The [[chromatic scale]], ascending}}Scales may be described according to the number of different pitch classes they contain:

* [[chromatic scale|Chromatic]], or dodecatonic (12 notes per octave)
* [[octatonic scale|Octatonic]] (8 notes per octave): used in [[jazz]] and [[modernism (music)|modern classical music]]
* [[heptatonic scale|Heptatonic]] (7 notes per octave): the most common modern Western scale
* [[hexatonic scale|Hexatonic]] (6 notes per octave): common in Western folk music
* [[pentatonic scale|Pentatonic]] (5 notes per octave): the anhemitonic form (lacking semitones) is common in folk music, especially in Asian music; also known as the "black note" scale
* [[tetratonic scale|Tetratonic]] (4 notes), [[tritonic scale|tritonic]] (3 notes), and [[ditonic scale|ditonic]] (2 notes): generally limited to [[prehistoric music|prehistoric]] ("primitive") music
* [[monotonic scale|Monotonic]] (1 note): limited use in liturgy, and for effect in modern art music{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;!--Monotonicity is not controversial, but who claims there is such a thing as a "monotonic scale"?--&gt;

Scales may also be described by their constituent intervals, such as being [[hemitonia|hemitonic]], [[cohemitonia|cohemitonic]], or having imperfections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|title=All The Scales|author=|date=|website=www.allthescales.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015071228/http://allthescales.org/intro.html#Perfection|archivedate=15 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many music theorists concur that the constituent intervals of a scale have a large role in the cognitive perception of its sonority, or tonal character.

"The number of the notes that make up a scale as well as the quality of the intervals between successive notes of the scale help to give the music of a culture area its peculiar sound quality."&lt;ref&gt;Nzewi, Meki, and Odyke Nzewi (2007), ''A Contemporary Study of Musical Arts''. Pretoria: Centre for Indigenous Instrumental African Music and Dance. Volume 1 p. 34 {{ISBN|978-1-920051-62-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "The pitch distances or intervals among the notes of a scale tell us more about the sound of the music than does the mere number of tones."&lt;ref&gt;Nettl, Bruno, and Helen Myers (1976). ''Folk Music in the United States'', p.39. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-1557-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scales may also be described by their symmetry, such as being [[palindrome|palindromic]], [[Chirality|chiral]]&lt;ref&gt;https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/#chirality {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330211555/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |date=30 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, or having rotational symmetry as in Messaien's [[modes of limited transposition]]. 

Scales can also be described by their distribution patterns and possibilities for notation. For example, a [[heliotonic]] scale is one that can be notated with one note head on each line and space, using only single and double alterations (flats, double-flats, sharps, and double-sharps). Thus all heliotonic scales are [[heptatonic scale|heptatonic]], but not all heptatonic scales are heliotonic. Since heliotonia is a metric of a scale's tone distribution pattern, is related to evenness, coherence, spectra variation, and the [[Generic_and_specific_intervals|Myhill Property]].

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a scale form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in [[combination]].  A 5-note scale has 10 of these [[Harmony|harmonic]] intervals, a 6-note scale has 15, a 7-note scale has 21, an 8-note scale has 28.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', pp.7ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the scale is not a [[Chord (music)|chord]], and might never be heard more than one note at a time, still the absence, presence, and placement of certain [[key (music)|key]] intervals plays a large part in the sound of the scale, the natural movement of melody within the scale, and the selection of [[Chord (music)|chords]] taken naturally from the scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A musical scale that contains [[tritone]]s is called tritonic (though the expression is also used for any scale with just three notes per octave, whether or not it includes a tritone), and one without tritones is ''atritonic''.  A scale or [[Chord (music)|chord]] that contains semitones is called hemitonic, and without semitones is [[Anhemitonic scale|anhemitonic]].

===Scales in composition===
Scales can be abstracted from [[performance]] or [[musical composition|composition]]. They are also often used [[precompositional]]ly to guide or limit a composition. Explicit instruction in scales has been part of compositional training for many centuries. One or more scales may be used in a composition, such as in [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[L'Isle Joyeuse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To the right, the first scale is a whole-tone scale, while the second and third scales are diatonic scales. All three are used in the opening pages of Debussy's piece.

==Western music==
{{See also|Musical mode}}
Scales in [[European classical music|traditional Western music]] generally consist of seven notes and repeat at the octave. Notes in the commonly used scales (see just below) are separated by [[Music Terminology|whole and half step]] [[interval (music)|intervals]] of ''tones'' and ''semitones.'' The harmonic minor scale includes a three-semitone step; the anhemitonic pentatonic includes two of those and no semitones.

Western music in the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] periods (1100–1600) tends to use the white-note [[diatonic scale]] C–D–E–F–G–A–B. [[Accidental (music)|Accidentals]] are rare, and somewhat unsystematically used, often to avoid the [[tritone]].

Music of the common practice periods (1600–1900) uses three types of scale:
* The [[diatonic scale]] (seven notes)—this includes the major scale and the natural minor
* The melodic and harmonic [[minor scale]]s (seven notes)

These scales are used in all of their transpositions. The music of this period introduces ''modulation,'' which involves systematic changes from one scale to another. Modulation occurs in relatively conventionalized ways. For example, major-mode pieces typically begin in a "tonic" diatonic scale and modulate to the "dominant" scale a fifth above.{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c' { 
  \clef treble \time 6/4
  f4 g a b cis dis f2
} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[whole tone scale]] starting on F, ascending}}In the 19th century (to a certain extent), but more in the 20th century, additional types of scales were explored:

* The [[chromatic scale]] (twelve notes)
* The [[whole tone scale|whole-tone scale]] (six notes)
* The [[pentatonic scale]] (five notes)
* The octatonic or [[diminished scale]]s (eight notes)
{{Image frame|content=&lt;score vorbis="1"&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
\relative c' { 
  \clef treble \time 7/4
  c4 d es fis g aes b c2
} }
&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=The [[Hungarian minor scale]] starting on C, ascending}}A large variety of other scales exists, some of the more common being:

* The [[Phrygian dominant scale]] (a mode of the harmonic minor scale)
* The [[Arabic maqam|Arabic scales]]
* The [[Hungarian minor scale]]
* The [[Byzantine music]] scales (called echoi)
* The [[Persian scale]]
Scales such as the pentatonic scale may be considered ''gapped'' relative to the diatonic scale. An ''auxiliary scale'' is a scale other than the primary or original scale. See: [[modulation (music)]] and [[Petrushka chord|Auxiliary diminished scale]].

==Note names==
In many musical circumstances, a specific note of the scale is chosen as the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]—the central and most stable note of the scale. In Western tonal music, simple songs or pieces typically start and end on the tonic note. Relative to a choice of a certain tonic, the notes of a scale are often labeled with numbers recording how many scale steps above the tonic they are. For example, the notes of the C [[major scale]] (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) can be labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, reflecting the choice of C as tonic. The expression [[scale degree]] refers to these numerical labels. Such labeling requires the choice of a "first" note; hence scale-degree labels are not intrinsic to the scale itself, but rather to its modes. For example, if we choose A as tonic, then we can label the notes of the C major scale using A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, and so on. When we do so, we create a new scale called the A [[minor scale]]. See the [[musical note]] article for how the notes are customarily named in different countries.

The scale degrees of a heptatonic (7-note) scale can also be named using the terms [[tonic (music)|tonic]], [[supertonic]], [[mediant]], [[subdominant]], [[Dominant (music)|dominant]], [[submediant]], [[subtonic]]. If the subtonic is a semitone away from the tonic, then it is usually called the [[leading-tone]] (or leading-note); otherwise the leading-tone refers to the raised subtonic. Also commonly used is the (movable do) [[Solfège#Movable do solfège|solfège]] naming convention in which each scale degree is denoted by a syllable. In the major scale, the solfège syllables are: do, re, mi, fa, so (or sol), la, ti (or si), do (or ut).

In naming the notes of a scale, it is customary that each scale degree be assigned its own letter name: for example, the A major scale is written A–B–C{{music|sharp}}–D–E–F{{music|sharp}}–G{{music|sharp}} rather than A–B–D{{music|flat}}–D–E–E{{music|doublesharp}}–G{{music|sharp}}. However, it is impossible to do this in scales that contain more than seven notes, at least in the English-language nomenclature system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;!--Who says it is not possible to name notes with letters of the alphabet following G? German nomenclature, at least, uses eight letters, A through H.--&gt;

Scales may also be identified by using a binary system of twelve zeros or ones to represent each of the twelve notes of a [[chromatic scale]]. It is assumed that the scale is tuned using [[12-tone equal temperament]] (so that, for instance, C{{Music|sharp}} is the same as D{{Music|flat}}), and that the tonic is in the leftmost position. For example, the [[binary number]] 101011010101, equivalent to the [[decimal number]] 2773, would represent any major scale (such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B). This system includes scales from 100000000000 (2048) to 111111111111 (4095), providing a total of 2048 possible [[Combinatorial species|species]], but only 351 unique scales containing from 1 to 12 notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A more mathematically flexible schema for binary representation, espoused by theorist Ian Ring in his study of musical scales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ring |first=Ian |title=A Study of Scales |url=http://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |publisher=Ian Ring |access-date=18 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060403/https://ianring.com/musictheory/scales/ |archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; has bits representing ascending tones, with the smaller bits representing lower pitches and higher bits representing higher pitches. This causes the bits to appear reversed compared with Duncan's system. Under this schema, a major scale is 101010110101 = (2741), a single root tone is 1, and a chromatic scale is still 111111111111 (4095). All the tone possibilities that begin with a root tone, and are thus scale-like, are odd-numbered.

Scales may also be shown as [[semitones]] from the tonic. For instance, 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 denotes any major scale such as C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which the first degree is, obviously, 0 semitones from the tonic (and therefore coincides with it), the second is 2 semitones from the tonic, the third is 4 semitones from the tonic, and so on. Again, this implies that the notes are drawn from a chromatic scale tuned with 12-tone equal temperament. For some fretted string instruments, such as the guitar and the [[bass guitar]], scales can be notated in [[tabulature]], an approach which indicates the fret number and string upon which each scale degree is played.

==Transposition and modulation==
{{confusing section|reason=transposition and modulation are different; first sentence introduces yet another term 'transform'; explanation then confuses all these|date=August 2018}}
Composers transform musical patterns by moving every note in the pattern by a constant number of scale steps: thus, in the [[C major]] scale, the pattern C–D–E might be shifted up, or [[transposition (music)|transposed]], a single scale step to become D–E–F. This process is called "scalar transposition" or "shifting to a new key" and can often be found in [[sequence (music)|musical sequences]] and patterns. (It is D-E-F# in Chromatic transposition). Since the steps of a scale can have various sizes, this process introduces subtle melodic and harmonic variation into the music. In Western tonal music, the simplest and most common type of modulation (or changing keys) is to shift from one major key to another key built on the first key's fifth (or dominant) scale degree. In the key of C major, this would involve moving to the key of G major (which uses an F#). Composers also often modulate to other related keys. In some [[Romantic music era]] pieces and contemporary music, composers modulate to "remote keys" that are not related to or close to the tonic. An example of a remote modulation would be taking a song that begins in C major and modulating (changing keys) to F# major.

&lt;/score&gt;|width=300|caption=A hexatonic [[blues scale]] on C, ascending}}Through the introduction of [[blue note]]s, jazz and [[blues]] employ scale intervals smaller than a semitone. The blue note is an [[interval (music)|interval]] that is technically neither [[major and minor|major nor minor]] but "in the middle", giving it a characteristic flavour. A regular [[piano]] cannot play blue notes, but with [[electric guitar]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]] and [[trumpet]], performers can "bend" notes a fraction of a tone sharp or flat to create blue notes For instance, in the key of E, the blue note would be either a note between G and G{{music|sharp}} or a note moving between both. 

In blues, a [[pentatonic scale]] is often used. In jazz, many different [[musical mode|modes]] and scales are used, often within the same piece of music. Chromatic scales are common, especially in modern jazz.

==Non-Western scales==
===Equally tempered===
In Western music, scale notes are often separated by [[Equal temperament]] tones or semitones, creating 12 intervals per octave each separating two tones where the higher tone has a oscillation frequency of a fixed ratio (by a factor equal to the twelfth root of two, or approximately 1.059463) higher than the frequency of the lower one. A scale uses a subset consisting typically of 7 of these 12 as scale steps. Other traditional tempered scale systems divide the octave to equal intervals by numbers other than 12. Examples are 53 in the [[Middle East]], and 72 in southern [[India]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Other===
Many other musical traditions use scales that include other intervals. These scales originate within the derivation of the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. [[Interval (music)|Musical intervals]] are complementary values of the [[harmonic]] [[overtone]]s series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html Explanation of the origin of musical scales clarified by a string division method] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824020439/http://www.furious.com/perfect/experimentalstringinstruments.html |date=24 August 2012 }} by [[Yuri Landman]] on furious.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many musical scales in the world are based on this system, except most of the musical scales from [[Indonesia]] and the [[Indochina]] Peninsulae, which are based on inharmonic resonance of the dominant metalophone and xylophone instruments.

===Intra-scale intervals===
Some scales use a different number of pitches. A common scale in Eastern music is the pentatonic scale, which consists of five notes that span an octave.

Some scales span part of an octave; Several such short scales are typically combined to form a scale spanning a full octave or more, and usually called with a third name of its own. The Middle Eastern music has around a dozen such basic short scales that are combined to form hundreds of full-octave spanning scales. Among these middle eastern scales [[Hejaz scale]] has one scale step spanning 14 intervals (of the middle eastern type found 53 in an octave) roughly similar to 3 semitones (of the western type found 12 in an octave), while [[Saba scale]], another of these middle eastern scales, has 3 consecutive scale steps within 14 commas, i.e. separated by roughly one western semitone either side of the middle tone.

[[Gamelan]] music uses a small variety of scales including [[Pélog]] and [[Sléndro]], none including equally tempered nor harmonic intervals. [[Indian classical music]] uses a moveable [[swara|seven-note scale]]. Indian [[Rāga]]s often use intervals smaller than a semitone.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Edwaard M. 1998. "Intervals, Scales, and Tuning.", p.247. In ''The Psychology of Music'', second edition, edited by Diana Deutsch, 215–64.

''Classical Persian Music: An Introduction''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2014}} In both rāgas and maqamat, the distance between a note and an inflection (e.g., [[Śruti (music)|śruti]]) of that same note may be less than a semitone.

'''Sophus Thalbitzer''' (1871–1941) was a Danish psychiatrist and medical doctor specializing in [[manic depressive psychosis|manic depressive psychoses]]. He successfully influenced [[LGBT history in Denmark|Danish legislation on homosexuality]] towards decriminalization in 1933.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=23 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thalbitzer never married in his life, there are no sources to support the hypotheses that he was [[homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].

==Life==
In 1912 Thalbitzer became consultant at the [[St Hans Women's Hospital]] near [[Copenhagen]].
In 1923 Thalbitzer became a member of the Advisory Board of Directors of the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]]. In 1924 and 1925 he published two articles on [[homosexuality]], successfully influencing Danish criminal legislation with his 'scientific' defence of the lowering of homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18.&lt;ref name="AldrichWotherspoon2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Rosen|editor=Robert Aldrich; Garry Wotherspoon|title=Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLWTqBmifh0C&amp;pg=PA518|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15983-8|pages=518–9|chapter=Thalbitzer, Sophus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2583">'''Telluric contamination''' is [[systematic error|contamination]] of the [[Astronomical spectroscopy|astronomical spectra]] by the [[Earth's atmosphere]].

==Interference with astronomical observations==
Most astronomical observations are conducted by measuring [[photon]]s ([[electromagnetic waves]]) which originate beyond the sky.  The molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, however, [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorb]] and [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emit]] their own light, especially in the visible and [[infrared|near-IR]] portion of the [[spectrum]], and any ground-based observation is subject to contamination from these telluric (earth-originating) sources.  Water vapor, oxygen, and OH are some of the more important molecules in telluric contamination.  Water contamination was particularly pronounced in the Mount Wilson solar Doppler measurements.

Many scientific telescopes have [[spectrograph]]s, which measure photons as a function of [[wavelength]] or [[frequency]], with typical resolution on the order of a [[nanometer]].  [[Spectroscopic]] observations can be used in myriad contexts, including measuring the chemical composition and physical properties of astronomical objects as well as measuring object velocities from the Doppler shift of spectral lines.  Unless they are corrected for, telluric contamination can produce errors or reduce precision in such data.

Telluric contamination can also be important for [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements.

==Telluric correction==
It is possible to correct for the effects of telluric contamination in an astronomical [[spectrum]]. This is done by preparing a telluric correction [[Function (mathematics)|function]], made by dividing a [[model spectrum]] of a star by an observation of an astronomical [[photometric standard stars|photometric standard star]]. This function can then be multiplied by an astronomical observation at each [[wavelength]] point.

While this method can restore the original shape of the [[spectrum]], the regions affected can be prone to high levels of [[noise]] due to the low number of counts in that area of the spectrum.

The '''Information School''' or '''iSchool''' of the [[University of Sheffield]], in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]], was founded in 1963 as the University's '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship''' and became in 2010 the first UK [[iSchool]]. Other names were the '''Postgraduate School of Librarianship and Information Science''' ('''PGSLIS''', 1967-81) and '''Department of Information Studies''' (1981-2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iSchool Timeline|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/is/about/history.html|work=University of Sheffield: Information School|accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2015}}, it employs 28 academic staff, 12 administrative/support staff, 7 affiliated research staff, and has about 50 research students. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath.

The department opened in 1964 as a library school, becoming only the second university-based department in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/016555158901500402 |last=Saunders |first=W. |year=1989|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5| pages = 193–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, like many [[information science]] departments it has grown to encompass teaching and research in [[cheminformatics]], educational informatics, [[health informatics]], [[information retrieval]], [[information systems]], knowledge and information management, as well as libraries and information society. Such is the status of the school, that it has twice been honoured with a special issue of the ''[[Journal of Information Science]]'' devoted entirely to the department, its staff and its research outputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1989 | journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=15 |issue=4-5|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol15/issue4-5/|title=The University of Sheffield Department of Information Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2003|title=Special Issue, 40 years of the Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield|journal=Journal of Information Science|volume=29 |issue=4|url=http://jis.sagepub.com/content/vol29/issue4/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research achievements==
The school has ranked highest or joint highest in its subject rating in every [[Research Assessment Exercise]] since the running of the first exercise in 1986. In this UK-government sponsored assessment of research outputs, no other department in its subject field (or its [[University of Sheffield|University]]) achieved this consistency; few departments of any subject area in UK universities managed such a high level of continuous research output (see the following links to the 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1992/c26_92t64.html |title=UFC 26/92 - RAE92: The Outcome Table 64 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/1996/1_96/t61.html |title=1996 RAE - Unit of Assessment: 61 |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/results/byuoa/uoa61.htm |title=Results : 2001 Research Assessment Exercise : Unit of Assessment : 61 Library and Information Management |publisher=Rae.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAE results). In 2008, rankings of departments was left to news organizations; the [[Times Higher Education]] placed Sheffield at No. 1 again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/Journals/THE/THE/18_December_2008/attachments/RAE_2008_THE_RESULTS.pdf |format=PDF |title=Times Higher Education Table of Excellence |publisher=Timeshighereducation.co.uk |accessdate=2015-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, an analysis of citations showed four of the ten most cited UK information studies academics were working in the Sheffield department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.20771 |url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/4579/ |last=Sanderson |first=M. | year=2008 | title=Revisiting h measured on UK LIS and IR academics| journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (JASIST) |volume=59 |issue=7| pages=1184–1190}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the first UK-based (and 2nd European) department to be become an [[i-school|iSchool]].

'''Watkins Books''' is London's oldest esoteric bookshop specializing in [[esotericism]], [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], [[oriental religion]] and [[contemporary spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westendextra.com/news/2010/apr/us-film-producer-supplies-magic-save-occult-bookshop |title=US film producer supplies the magic to save occult bookshop |publisher=West End Extra |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book store was established by John M. Watkins, a friend of [[Madame Blavatsky]], in 1897 at 26 [[Charing Cross]]. John Watkins had already been selling books via a catalogue which he began publishing in March 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins Review, Issue 24, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The first biography of [[Aleister Crowley]] recounts a story of Crowley making all of the books in Watkins magically disappear and reappear.&lt;ref&gt;Page 268, 1952 edition of ''The Great Beast'' by John Symonds&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoffrey Watkins (1896–1981) owned and managed the store after his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/geoffrey-watkins |title=Geoffrey Watkins: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an author&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Watkins, Geoffrey (1896-1981) | encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology | publisher=The Gale Group Inc./[[Encyclopedia.com]] | accessdate=September 30, 2018 | year=2001 | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403804790.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publisher, with notable books including first publishing [[Carl Gustav Jung]]'s 1925 edition of ''[[Seven Sermons to the Dead|Septem Sermones ad Mortuos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/jung.html |title=The automatic writings of Jung |publisher=[[Philipcoppens.com]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Watkins Books moved to 21 [[Cecil Court]] where it has been continuously trading ever since. It publishes a magazine called the ''Watkins' Mind Body Spirit magazine'', which has featured leading authors from [[mind-body-spirit]] and esoteric fields. Watkins Books has been owned by [[Etan Ilfeld]] since March 2010.&lt;ref name="The Bookseller"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/deal-agreed-over-watkins-books.html | title=Deal agreed over Watkins Books | work=[[The Bookseller]] | date=March 15, 2010 | accessdate=September 30, 2018 | author=Gallagher, Victoria }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kindred Spirit, Issue 109&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, a new website has been launched, and the store regularly hosts book launches and signings. Additionally, the Watkins website has integrated a spiritual map of London that everyone is invited to contribute to. Watkins Books has also published a free Mind Body Spirit app that is available on the iPhone/iPad and Android devices. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mind-body-spirit-books-by/id463439169?mt=8 |title=App Store - Mind Body Spirit Books by Watkins |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2012-02-18 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watkins makes an annual list of "the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People," which is published online and in the spring issue of their magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |title=The Spiritual 100 - Watkins' annual list of the 100 most spiritually influential living people! |publisher=Watkinsbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main factors used to compile the list are that the person has to be alive, the person has to have made a unique and spiritual contribution on a global scale, and the person is frequently googled, appears in [[Nielsen Data]] and is actively talked about on the Internet.

The [[World Wide Web]] has become a major delivery platform for a variety of complex and sophisticated enterprise applications in several domains. In addition to their inherent multifaceted functionality, these Web applications exhibit complex behaviour and place some unique demands on their usability, performance, security, and ability to grow and evolve. However, a vast majority of these applications continue to be developed in an ad-hoc way, contributing to problems of usability, maintainability, quality and reliability.&lt;ref name="ciabe"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pressman | first1 = Roger S | year = 1998 | title = Can Internet Applications be Engineered? | url = | journal = IEEE Software | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 104–110 | doi=10.1109/ms.1998.714869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tangled"&gt;Roger S Pressman, "What a Tangled Web we Weave," IEEE Software, Jan/Feb 2001, Vol. 18, No.1, pp 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; While Web development can benefit from established practices from other related disciplines, it has certain distinguishing characteristics that demand special considerations. In recent years, there have been developments towards addressing these considerations.

'''Web engineering''' focuses on the methodologies, techniques, and tools that are the foundation of [[Web application development]] and which support their design, development, evolution, and evaluation. Web application development has certain characteristics that make it different from traditional software, information system, or computer application development.

Web engineering is multidisciplinary and encompasses contributions from diverse areas: [[systems analysis]] and [[systems design|design]], software engineering, hypermedia/hypertext engineering, requirements engineering, human-computer interaction, user interface, information engineering, information indexing and retrieval, testing, modelling and simulation, project management, and graphic design and presentation. Web engineering is neither a clone nor a subset of software engineering, although both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of [[Web application|Web-based application]]s.

== As a discipline ==
Proponents of Web engineering supported the establishment of Web engineering as a discipline at an early stage of Web. Major arguments for Web engineering as a new discipline are:

* Web-based Information Systems (WIS) development process is different and unique.&lt;ref&gt;Gerti Kappel, Birgit Proll, Seiegfried, and Werner Retschitzegger, "An Introduction to Web Engineering," in Web Engineering, Gerti Kappel, et al. (eds.) John Wiley and Sons, Heidelberg, Germany, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* Web engineering is multi-disciplinary; no single discipline (such as software engineering) can provide complete theory basis, body of knowledge and practices to guide WIS development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deshpande | first1 = Yogesh | last2 = Hansen | first2 = Steve | year = 2001 | title = Web Engineering: Creating Discipline among Disciplines | url = | journal = IEEE Multimedia | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 81–86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Issues of evolution and lifecycle management when compared to more 'traditional' applications.
* Web-based information systems and applications are pervasive and non-trivial. The prospect of Web as a platform will continue to grow and it is worth being treated specifically.

However, it has been controversial, especially for people in other traditional disciplines such as software engineering, to recognize Web engineering as a new field. The issue is how different and independent Web engineering is, compared with other disciplines.

Main topics of Web engineering include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

=== Modeling disciplines ===
* Business Processes for Applications on the Web

=== Implementation disciplines ===
* Integrated Web Application Development Environments
* Code Generation for Web Applications
* Software Factories for/on the Web
* Web 2.0, AJAX, E4X, ASP.NET, PHP and Other New Developments
* [[Web Service]]s Development and Deployment

=== Testing disciplines ===
* Testing and Evaluation of Web systems and Applications.
* Testing Automation, Methods, and Tools.

=== Applications categories disciplines ===
* [[Semantic Web]] applications
* Document centric Web sites
* Transactional Web applications
* Interactive Web applications
* Workflow-based Web applications
* Collaborative Web applications
* Portal-oriented Web applications
* Ubiquitous and Mobile Web Applications

A '''wetland''' is a distinct [[ecosystem]] that is [[Inundation|inundated]] by [[water]], either permanently or seasonally, where oxygen-free processes prevail.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"&gt;{{cite book|last= Keddy|first= P.A.|title=Wetland ecology : principles and conservation |date=2010|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-0521519403 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eVeaSqFy2VgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from other land forms or water bodies is the characteristic [[vegetation]] of [[aquatic plants]],&lt;ref name="Official Macquarie Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last= Butler |editor-first= S.|title= Macquarie Concise Dictionary|edition=5th|date=2010|publisher= Macquarie Dictionary Publishers|location= Sydney, Australia|isbn= 978-1-876429-85-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ramsar"&gt;{{cite web | title = Official page of the Ramsar Convention| accessdate = 2011-09-25 | url = http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs/main/ramsar/1-30_4000_0__}}&lt;/ref&gt; adapted to the unique [[hydric soil]]. Wetlands play a number of functions, including water purification, water storage, processing of carbon and other nutrients, stabilization of shorelines, and support of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wetlands |url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/water/wetlands/ |website=USDA- Natural Resource Conservation Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetlands are also considered the most [[biodiversity|biologically diverse]] of all ecosystems, serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal life. Whether any individual wetland performs these functions, and the degree to which it performs them, depends on characteristics of that wetland and the lands and waters near it.&lt;ref name="ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wetland and Stream Rapid Assessments : development, validation, and application|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |isbn=978-0128050910|location=[S.l.]|oclc=1017607532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods for rapidly assessing these functions, wetland [[ecological health]], and general wetland condition have been developed in many regions and have contributed to [[wetland conservation]] partly by raising public awareness of the functions and the [[ecosystem services]] some wetlands provide.&lt;ref name="ELSEVIER ACADEMIC PRESS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author1=Hollis, T. |author2=Bedding, J. |title=Can we stop the wetlands from drying up? |magazine=New Scientist |date=1994 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14319323-700/ |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constructed wetland]]s are used to treat municipal and industrial [[wastewater]] as well as [[stormwater]] runoff. They may also play a role in [[water-sensitive urban design]].

==Definitions==
A patch of land that develops pools of water after a [[rain storm]] would not necessarily be considered a "wetland", even though the land is wet. Wetlands have unique characteristics: they are generally distinguished from other [[water bodies]] or [[landform]]s based on their [[water level]] and on the types of [[plant]]s that live within them. Specifically, wetlands are characterized as having a [[water table]] that stands at or near the [[land surface]] for a long enough period each year to support [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvwd.net/water_glossary.htm |title= Glossary of Terms |publisher=Carpinteria Valley Water District |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163056/http://www.cvwd.net/water_glossary.htm |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mapping2.orr.noaa.gov/portal/calcasieu/calc_html/resources/glossary.html |title=Glossary |publisher=Mapping2.orr.noaa.gov |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425163041/http://mapping2.orr.noaa.gov/portal/calcasieu/calc_html/resources/glossary.html |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more concise definition is a community composed of [[hydric soil]] and [[hydrophytes]].&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt;

Wetlands have also been described as [[ecotone]]s, providing a transition between dry land and water bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alabamapower.com/hydro/glossary.asp |title=Glossary |publisher=Alabama Power |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321233304/http://www.alabamapower.com/hydro/glossary.asp |archivedate=2012-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsch and Gosselink write that wetlands exist "...at the interface between truly [[terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] ecosystems and [[aquatic habitat|aquatic]] systems, making them inherently different from each other, yet highly dependent on both."&lt;ref name="mitsch2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitsch

In environmental decision-making, there are subsets of definitions that are agreed upon to make regulatory and policy decisions.

===Technical definitions===
[[File:Sunrise at viru bog.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Sunrise at Viru Bog, Estonia]]
A wetland is "an ecosystem that arises when inundation by water produces soils dominated by anaerobic and aerobic processes, which, in turn, forces the biota, particularly rooted plants, to adapt to flooding."{{sfnp|Keddy|2010|p=2}} There are four main kinds of wetlands&amp;nbsp;– [[marsh]], [[swamp]], [[bog]] and [[fen]] (bogs and fens being types of [[mire]]s). Some experts also recognize wet meadows and aquatic ecosystems as additional wetland types.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; The largest wetlands in the world include the swamp forests of the Amazon and the peatlands of Siberia.&lt;ref name="FraserKeddy"/&gt;

====Ramsar Convention definition====
Under the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar international wetland conservation treaty]], wetlands are defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ramsar 40th Anniversary Message for November| publisher = Ramsar| accessdate = 2011-10-10 | url = http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-home/main/ramsar/1_4000_0__}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Article 1.1: "...wetlands are areas of marsh, [[fen]], [[peatland]] or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, [[fresh water|fresh]], [[brackish water|brackish]] or [[saline water|salt]], including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres."
*Article 2.1: "[Wetlands] may incorporate [[riparian]] and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and [[island]]s or bodies of marine water deeper than six metres at [[low tide]] lying within the wetlands."

====Regional definitions====
Although the general definition given above applies around the world, each county and region tends to have its own definition for legal purposes. In the United States, wetlands are defined as "those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|url=http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/wetlands/definitions.cfm|title=EPA Regulations listed at 40 CFR 230.3(t)|accessdate=2014-02-18|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been used in the enforcement of the [[Clean Water Act]]. Some US states, such as [[Massachusetts]] and [[New York (state)|New York]], have separate definitions that may differ from the federal government's.

In the [[United States Code]], the term wetland is defined "as land that (A) has a predominance of hydric soils, (B) is inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support a prevalence of hydrophytic vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions and (C) under normal circumstances supports a prevalence of such vegetation." Related to this legal definitions, the term "normal circumstances" are conditions expected to occur during the wet portion of the growing season under normal climatic conditions (not unusually dry or unusually wet), and in the absence of significant disturbance. It is not uncommon for a wetland to be dry for long portions of the growing season. Wetlands can be dry during the dry season and abnormally dry periods during the wet season, but under normal environmental conditions the soils in a wetland will be saturated to the surface or inundated such that the soils become anaerobic, and those conditions will persist through the wet portion of the growing season.&lt;ref&gt;US Government Publishing Office. (2011) [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/3801 16 U.S. Code Chapter 58 Subchapter I, § 3801 – Definitions]. Legal Information Institute,  Cornell Law School, Ithaca.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The most important factor producing wetlands is [[flooding]]. The duration of flooding or prolonged soil saturation by [[groundwater]] determines whether the resulting wetland has aquatic, [[marsh]] or [[swamp]] [[vegetation]]. Other important factors include fertility, natural disturbance, competition, [[herbivory]], burial and salinity.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; When [[peat]] accumulates, [[bog]]s and [[fen]]s arise.

==Characteristics==
Wetlands vary widely due to local and regional differences in [[topography]], [[hydrology]], [[vegetation]], and other factors, including human involvement.

==Hydrology==
Wetland hydrology is associated with the spatial and temporal dispersion, flow, and physio-chemical attributes of surface and ground water in its reservoirs. Based on hydrology, wetlands can be categorized as [[riverine]] (associated with streams), [[wikt:lacustrine|lacustrine]] (associated with lakes and reservoirs), and [[palustrine]] (isolated). Sources of hydrological flows into wetlands are predominantly [[precipitation]], surface water, and [[groundwater]]. Water flows out of wetlands by [[evapotranspiration]], [[surface runoff]], and subsurface water outflow. [[Hydrodynamics]] (the movement of water through and from a wetland) affects hydro-periods (temporal fluctuations in water levels) by controlling the water balance and water storage within a wetland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richardson|first1=J. L.|last2=Arndt|first2=J. L.|last3=Montgomery|first3=J. A.|date=2001|contribution=Hydrology of wetland and related soils|editor1-first=J. L.|editor1-last=Richardson|editor2-first=M. J.|editor2-last=Vepraskas|title=Wetland Soils|publisher=Lewis Publishers|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape characteristics control wetland hydrology and [[hydrochemistry]]. The [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[concentration (chemistry)|concentrations]] of water depend on [[temperature]] and [[atmospheric pressure]]. Hydrochemistry within wetlands is determined by the [[pH]], [[salinity]], nutrients, [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]], soil composition, [[Water hardness|hardness]], and the sources of water. Water chemistry of wetlands varies across landscapes and climatic regions. Wetlands are generally [[minerotrophic]] with the exception of bogs.

Bogs receive most of their water from the [[atmosphere]]; therefore, their water usually has low mineral ionic composition. In contrast, groundwater has a higher concentration of dissolved nutrients and minerals.

The water chemistry of fens ranges from low pH and low minerals to alkaline with high accumulation of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] because they acquire their water from precipitation as well as ground water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitt|first1=D. H.|last2=Chee|first2=W|date=1990|title=The relationships of vegetation to surface water chemistry and peat chemistry in fens of Alberta, Canada|journal=Plant Ecology|volume=89|issue=2|pages=87–106|doi=10.1007/bf00032163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of salinity===

Salinity has a strong influence on wetland water chemistry, particularly in wetlands along the coast.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=B. R.|editor1-last=Silliman|editor2-first=E. D.|editor2-last=Grosholz|editor3-first=M. D.|editor3-last=Bertness|date=2009|title=Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in regions with large precipitation deficits. In non-riverine wetlands, natural salinity is regulated by interactions between ground and surface water, which may be influenced by human activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=M. J.|last2=Schreiber|first2=E. S. G.|last3=Kohout|first3=M.|last4=Ough|first4=K.|last5=Lennie|first5=R.|last6=Turnbull|first6=D.|last7=Jin|first7=C.|last8=Clancy|first8=T.|date=2007|title=Wetlands as landscape units: spatial patterns in salinity and water chemistry|journal=Wetlands, Ecology &amp; Management|volume=15|issue=2|pages=95–103|doi=10.1007/s11273-006-9015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil===
[[Carbon]] is the major nutrient cycled within wetlands. Most nutrients, such as [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[carbon]], and [[nitrogen]] are found within the soil of wetlands. [[Anaerobic respiration|Anaerobic]] and [[aerobic respiration]] in the soil influences the nutrient cycling of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponnamperuma|first=F. N.|date=1972|title=The chemistry of submerged soils|journal=Advances in Agronomy|volume=24|pages=29–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the solubility of phosphorus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=P. A., Jr.|last2=Reddy|first2=K. R.|date=1994|title=Role of Eh and pH on phosphorus geochemistry in sediments of Lake Okeechobee, Florida|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|volume=23|issue=5|pages=955–964|doi=10.2134/jeq1994.00472425002300050016x}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus contributing to the chemical variations in its water. Wetlands with low pH and saline conductivity may reflect the presence of acid [[sulfate]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minh|first1=L. Q.|last2=Tuong|first2=T. P.|last3=van Mensvoort|first3=M. E. F.|last4=Bouma|first4=J.|date=1998|title=Soil and water table management effects on aluminum dynamics in an acid sulphate soil in Vietnam|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=68|issue=3|pages=255–262|doi=10.1016/s0167-8809(97)00158-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wetlands with average salinity levels can be heavily influenced by calcium or magnesium. [[Biogeochemistry|Biogeochemical processes]] in wetlands are determined by soils with low [[redox]] potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=W. A.|date=1997|title=Biogeochemistry: An Analysis of Global Change|edition=2nd|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetland soils are identified by [[redoxymorphic]] mottles or low [[Munsell color system#Chroma|chroma]], as determined by the [[Munsell Color System]].

===Biota===
The [[biota (ecology)|biota]] of a wetland system includes its flora and fauna as described below. The most important factor affecting the biota is the duration of flooding.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; Other important factors include fertility and salinity. In [[fen]]s, species are highly dependent on water chemistry. The chemistry of water flowing into wetlands depends on the source of water and the geological material in which it flows through&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bedford|first=B. L.|date=1996|title=The need to define hydrologic equivalence at the landscape scale for freshwater wetland mitigation|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=1|pages=57–68|doi=10.2307/2269552|jstor=2269552}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the nutrients discharged from organic matter in the soils and plants at higher elevations in slope wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=M. L.|last2=Rhoades|first2=C. C.|last3=Dwire|first3=K. A.|date=2011|title=Influences of Bedrock Geology on Water Chemistry of Slope Wetlands and Headwaters Streams in the Southern Rocky Mountains|journal=Wetlands|volume=31|issue=2|pages=251–261|doi=10.1007/s13157-011-0157-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biota may vary within a wetland due to season or recent flood regimes.

====Flora====
[[File:Nelumbo nucifera LOTUS bud.jpg|thumb|Bud of ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'', an aquatic plant.]]

There are four main groups of [[hydrophyte]]s that are found in wetland systems throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blacktown Council wetlands |accessdate=2011-09-25 |url=http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410125002/http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |archivedate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Submergent plant|Submerged]] wetland vegetation can grow in saline and fresh-water conditions. Some species have underwater flowers, while others have long stems to allow the flowers to reach the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchinson|first1=G. E.|date=1975|title=A Treatise on Limnology. Vol. 3: Limnological Botany|location=New York, NY|publisher=John Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submerged species provide a food source for native fauna, habitat for invertebrates, and also possess filtration capabilities. Examples include [[seagrasses]] and [[Vallisneria|eelgrass]].

Floating water plants or floating vegetation is usually small, like arrow arum (''[[Peltandra virginica]]'').

Trees and shrubs, where they comprise much of the cover in saturated soils, qualify those areas in most cases as [[swamp]]s.&lt;ref name="Keddy2010"/&gt; The upland boundary of swamps is determined partly by water levels. This can be affected by dams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Hughes|editor-first=F. M. R.|date=2003|title=The Flooded Forest: Guidance for policy makers and river managers in Europe on the restoration of floodplain forests|series=FLOBAR2, Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some swamps can be dominated by a single species, such as [[silver maple]] swamps around the [[Great Lakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilcox|first1=D.

R.|date=2007|title=Lake-level variability and water availability in the Great Lakes|series=USGS Circular 1311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like those of the [[Amazon basin]], have large numbers of different tree species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goulding|first=M.|date=1980|title=The Fishes and the Forest: Explorations in Amazonian Natural History|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include cypress (''[[Taxodium]]'') and [[mangrove]].

====Fauna====
[[File:Northern Leopard Frog (Lithobates pipiens).jpg|thumb|Many species of [[frog]]s live in wetlands, while others visit them each year to lay eggs.]]
[[File:Snapping turtle 3 md.jpg|thumb|[[Snapping turtle]]s are one of the many kinds of turtles found in wetlands.]]
[[Fish]] are more dependent on wetland ecosystems than any other type of habitat. Seventy-five percent of the United States' commercial fish and shellfish stocks depend solely on estuaries to survive.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"&gt;{{cite web | title=Ramsar Convention Ecosystem Services Benefit Factsheets| accessdate = 2011-09-25 | url = http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-info-ecosystem-services/main/ramsar/1-30-103%5E24258_4000_0__}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical fish species need mangroves for critical hatchery and nursery grounds and the coral reef system for food.

[[Amphibian]]s such as [[frog]]s need both terrestrial and aquatic habitats in which to reproduce and feed. While tadpoles control algal populations, adult frogs forage on insects. Frogs are used as an indicator of [[ecosystem health]] due to their thin skin which absorbs both nutrient and toxins from the surrounding environment resulting in an above average extinction rate in unfavorable and polluted environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savethefrogs.com/why-frogs/ |title=Frogs {{!}} Bioindicators |website=Savethefrogs.com |date=2011 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Reptile]]s such as [[alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s are common in wetlands of some regions. Alligators occur in fresh water along with the fresh water species of the crocodile.The Florida [[Everglades]] is the only place in the world where both crocodiles and alligators coexist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mazzotti, F.J. |author2=Best, G.R. |author3=Brandt, L.A. |author4=Cherkiss, M.S. |author5=Jeffery, B.M. |author6=Rice, K.G. |year=2009 |title=Alligators and crocodiles as indicators for restoration of Everglades ecosystems |journal=Ecological Indicators 9(6) |page=S137−S149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[saltwater crocodile]] inhabits estuaries and mangroves and can be seen in the coastline bordering the [[Great Barrier Reef]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Messel, H. 1981. Surveys of tidal river systems in the Northern Territory of Australia and their crocodile populations (Vol. 1). Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Snake]]s, [[lizard]]s and [[turtle]]s also can be seen throughout wetlands. [[Snapping turtle]]s are one of the many kinds of turtles found in wetlands.
 
[[Bird]]s, particularly [[waterfowl]] and [[Wader|wading birds]], use wetlands extensively&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Wetland birds: habitat resources and conservation implications |last=Milton |first=W. |date=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0511011368 |location=Cambridge|oclc=50984660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mammal]]s include numerous small and medium-sized species such as [[vole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[bat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and [[platypus]] in addition to large herbivorous and apex species such as the [[beaver]], [[coypu]], [[swamp rabbit]], [[Florida panther]], and [[moose]]. Wetlands attract many mammals due to abundant seeds, berries, and other vegetation components, as well as abundant populations of prey such as invertebrates, small reptiles and amphibians.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

[[Insect]]s and [[invertebrate]]s total more than half of the 100,000 known animal species in wetlands. Insects and invertebrates can be submerged in the water or soil, on the surface, and in the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Invertebrates in freshwater wetlands of North America : ecology and management|date=1999|publisher=Wiley|others=Batzer, Darold P., Rader, Russell Ben., Wissinger, Scott A.|isbn=978-0471292586|location=New York|oclc=39747651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Algae====

[[Algae]] are diverse water plants that can vary in size, color, and shape. Algae occur naturally in habitats such as inland lakes, inter-tidal zones, and damp soil and provide a dedicated food source for many animals, including some invertebrates, fish, turtles, and frogs. There are three main groups of algae:

*[[Plankton]] are algae which are [[microscopic]], free-floating algae. This algae is so tiny that on average, if 50 of these microscopic algae were lined up end-to-end, it would only measure one millimetre. Plankton are the basis of the food web and are responsible for [[primary production]] in the ocean using photosynthesis to make food.
*[[Filamentous algae]] are long strands of algae cells that form floating mats.
*[[Chara (alga)|''Chara'']] and ''[[Nitella]]'' algae are upright algae that look like a submerged plant with roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |title=Taken from Blacktown Council Wetland Inventory |publisher=Blacktown Council |accessdate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122111725/http://www.blacktown.nsw.gov.au/environment/educational-resources/wetlands/animals-plants-and-algae-in-wetlands.cfm |archivedate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climates==
===Temperature===
[[File:MiddleSpring.JPG|thumb|Wetlands contrast the hot, arid landscape around Middle Spring, [[Fish Springs National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Utah]]]]
Wetlands are located in every climatic zone.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Temperatures vary greatly depending on the location of the wetland. Many of the world's wetlands are in [[temperate zone]]s, midway between the North or South Pole and the equator. In these zones, summers are warm and winters are cold, but temperatures are not extreme. In a temperate zone wetland, such as one along the [[Gulf of Mexico]], a typical temperature might be {{convert|11|C|F}}. Wetlands in the [[tropics]] are much warmer for a larger portion of the year. Wetlands on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] can reach temperatures exceeding {{convert|50|C|F}} and would therefore be subject to rapid evaporation. In northeastern [[Siberia]], which has a polar climate, wetland temperatures can be as low as {{convert|−50|C|F}}. [[Peatland]]s insulate the [[permafrost]] in subarctic regions, thus delaying or preventing thawing of [[permafrost]] during summer, as well as inducing the formation of [[permafrost]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ramsar.org/document/peatlands-climate-change-mitigation-and-biodiversity-conservation|title=PEATLANDS, CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|deadurl=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precipitation===
The amount of precipitation a wetland receives varies widely according to its area. Wetlands in [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and western [[Ireland]] typically receive about {{convert|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. In some places in [[Southeast Asia]], where heavy rains occur, they can receive up to {{convert|10000|mm|in|abbr=on}}. In some drier regions, wetlands exist where as little as {{convert|180|mm|in|abbr=on}} precipitation occurs each year. {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Uses of wetlands==

Depending partly on a wetland's geographic and topographic location,&lt;ref&gt;Adamus, P.R. and L.T. Stockwell. 1983. ''A Method for Wetland Functional Assessment.'' Vol. I. Critical Review and Evaluation Concepts. FHWA-IP-82-23. Federal Highway Admin., Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; the functions it performs can support multiple [[ecosystem services]], values, or benefits. [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment|United Nations Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] and [[Ramsar Convention]] described wetlands as a whole to be of [[biosphere]] significance and societal importance in the following areas, for example:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

*[[Flood control|Water storage (flood control)]]
*Groundwater replenishment
*Shoreline stabilisation and storm protection
*[[Water purification]]
*Reservoirs of [[biodiversity]]
*Pollination
*Wetland products
*Cultural values
*Recreation and [[Eco tourism|tourism]]
*[[Climate change mitigation]] and adaptation

According to the Ramsar Convention:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The economic worth of the ecosystem services provided to society by intact, naturally functioning wetlands is frequently much greater than the perceived benefits of converting them to 'more valuable' intensive land use – particularly as the profits from unsustainable use often go to relatively few individuals or corporations, rather than being shared by society as a whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Unless otherwise cited, ecosystem services information is based on the following series of references.''&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

To replace these wetland [[ecosystem services]], enormous amounts of money would need to be spent on [[water purification]] plants, dams, levees, and other hard infrastructure, and many of the services are impossible to replace.

=== Water storage (flood control) ===
''Major wetland type: floodplain and closed-depression wetlands''

'''Storage reservoirs and flood protection:''' The wetland system of [[floodplains]] is formed from major rivers downstream from their [[headwaters]]. "The floodplains of major rivers act as natural storage reservoirs, enabling excess water to spread out over a wide area, which reduces its depth and speed. Wetlands close to the headwaters of streams and rivers can slow down rainwater runoff and spring snowmelt so that it doesn't run straight off the land into water courses. This can help prevent sudden, damaging floods downstream."&lt;ref name="ramsar_a" /&gt; Notable river systems that produce large spans of floodplain include the [[Nile River]], the Niger river inland delta, [the Zambezi River flood plain], [the Okavango River inland delta], [the Kafue River flood plain][the Lake Bangweulu flood plain] (Africa), [[Mississippi River]] (USA), [[Amazon River]] (South America), [[Yangtze River]] (China), [[Danube River]] (Central Europe) and [[Murray-Darling]] River (Australia).

'''Human impact:''' Converting wetlands to upland through drainage and development forces adjoining or downstream water channels into narrower corridors. This accelerates watershed hydrologic response to storm events and this increases the need in some cases for alternative means of flood control. That is because the newly formed channels must manage the same amount of precipitation, causing flood peaks to be [higher or deeper] and floodwaters to travel faster.

Water management engineering developments in the past century have degraded these wetlands through the construction of artificial embankments. These constructions may be classified as [[Levee|dykes]], bunds, [[levees]], [[weirs]], barrages and [[dams]] but serve the single purpose of concentrating water into a select source or area. Wetland water sources that were once spread slowly over a large, shallow area are pooled into deep, concentrated locations. Loss of wetland floodplains results in more severe and damaging flooding. Catastrophic human impact in the Mississippi River floodplains was seen in death of several hundred individuals during a [[levee breach]] in New Orleans caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Ecological catastrophic events from human-made embankments have been noticed along the Yangtze River floodplains since the middle of the river has become prone to more frequent and damaging flooding. Some of these events include the loss of [[riparian vegetation]], a 30% loss of the vegetation cover throughout the river's basin, a doubling of the percentage of the land affected by soil erosion, and a reduction in reservoir capacity through [[siltation]] build-up in floodplain lakes.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

===Groundwater replenishment===
''Major wetland type: [[marsh]], [[swamp]], and subterranean [[karst]] and cave hydrological systems''

The [[surface water]] which is the water visibly seen in wetland systems only represents a portion of the overall water cycle which also includes [[atmospheric water]] and [[groundwater]]. Wetland systems are directly linked to groundwater and a crucial regulator of both the quantity and [[water quality|quality of water]] found below the ground. Wetland systems that are made of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] [[sediment]]s like [[limestone]] or occur in areas with highly variable and fluctuating water tables especially have a role in [[groundwater replenishment]] or [[water recharge]]. Sediments that are [[porous]] allow water to filter down through the soil and overlying rock into [[aquifers]] which are the source of 95% of the world's drinking water. Wetlands can also act as recharge areas when the surrounding water table is low and as a discharge zone when it is too high. [[Karst cave|Karst]] (cave) systems are a unique example of this system and are a connection of underground rivers influenced by rain and other forms of [[precipitation]]. These wetland systems are capable of regulating changes in the water table on upwards of {{convert|130|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

'''Human impact''': Groundwater is an important source of water for [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[irrigation]] of crops. Over 1&amp;nbsp;billion people in Asia and 65% of the public water sources in Europe source 100% of their water from groundwater. Irrigation is a massive use of groundwater with 80% of the world's groundwater used for agricultural production.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

Unsustainable abstraction of groundwater has become a major concern. In the Commonwealth of [[Australia]], water licensing is being implemented to control use of water in major agricultural regions. On a global scale, groundwater deficits and water scarcity is one of the most pressing concerns facing the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ramsar_a"/&gt;

===Shoreline stabilization and storm protection===
''Wetland type: [[Mangrove]]s, [[coral reef]]s, [[salt marsh]]''

{{Main|Integrated coastal zone management}}

Tidal and inter-tidal wetland systems protect and stabilize coastal zones. [[Coral reefs]] provide a protective barrier to coastal shoreline. [[Mangroves]] stabilize the coastal zone from the interior and will migrate with the shoreline to remain adjacent to the boundary of the water. The main conservation benefit these systems have against storms and [[storm surge]]s is the ability to reduce the speed and height of waves and floodwaters.

'''Human impact''': The sheer number of people who live and work near the coast is expected to grow immensely over the next fifty years. From an estimated 200&amp;nbsp;million people that currently live in low-lying coastal regions, the development of urban coastal centers is projected to increase the population by fivefold within 50 years.&lt;ref name="urlUNEP-Home"&gt;{{cite web

The United Kingdom has begun the concept of managed coastal realignment. This management technique provides shoreline protection through restoration of natural wetlands rather than through applied engineering. In East Asia, reclamation of coastal wetlands has resulted in widespread transformation of the coastal zone, and up to 65% of coastal wetlands have been destroyed by coastal development.&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation | first1 = J. | last1 = MacKinnon | first2 = Y.

===Water purification===
''Wetland types: floodplain, closed-depression wetlands, [[mudflat]], [[salt marsh]], mangroves''

'''Nutrient retention:''' Wetlands cycle both sediments and nutrients balancing [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] and [[aquatic ecosystems]]. A natural function of wetland vegetation is the up-take, storage, and (for nitrate) the removal of nutrients found in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] from the surrounding soil and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|title=Letting Nature Do the Job|date=2008-08-01|website=Wild.org|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113192135/http://www.wild.org/blog/letting-nature-do-the-job|archive-date=2013-01-13|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many wetlands, nutrients are retained until plants die or are harvested by animals or humans and taken to another location, or until microbial processes convert soluble nutrients to a gas as is the case with nitrate.

'''Sediment and heavy metal traps:''' Precipitation and surface runoff induces [[soil erosion]], transporting sediment in suspension into and through waterways. These sediments move towards larger and more sizable waterways through a natural process that moves water towards oceans. All types of sediments which may be composed of clay, sand, silt, and rock can be carried into wetland systems through this process. Wetland vegetation acts as a physical barrier to slow water flow and trap sediment for short or long periods of time. Suspended sediment often contains heavy metals that are retained when wetlands trap the sediment. In some cases, certain metals are taken up through wetland plant stems, roots, and leaves. Many floating plant species, for example, can absorb and filter heavy metals. [[Water hyacinth]] (''Eichhornia crassipes''), [[duckweed]] (''Lemna'') and [[water fern]] (''Azolla'') store [[iron]] and [[copper]] commonly found in [[wastewater]]. Many fast-growing plants rooted in the soils of wetlands such as [[cattail]] (''Typha'') and [[Phragmites|reed]] (''Phragmites'') also aid in the role of heavy metal up-take. Animals such as the [[oyster]] can filter more than {{convert|200|L|gal}} of water per day while grazing for food, removing nutrients, suspended sediments, and chemical contaminants in the process. On the other hand, some types of wetlands facilitate the mobilization and bioavailability of mercury (another heavy metal), which in its [[Methylmercury|methyl mercury]] form increases the risk of bioaccumulation in fish important to animal food webs and harvested for human consumption.

'''Capacity:''' The ability of wetland systems to store or remove nutrients and trap sediment and associated metals is highly efficient and effective but each system has a threshold. An overabundance of nutrient input from fertilizer run-off, sewage effluent, or non-point pollution will cause [[eutrophication]]. Upstream erosion from deforestation can overwhelm wetlands making them shrink in size and cause dramatic [[biodiversity loss]] through excessive sedimentation load. Retaining high levels of metals in sediments is problematic if the sediments become resuspended or oxygen and pH levels change at a future time. The capacity of wetland vegetation to store heavy metals depends on the particular metal, oxygen and pH status of wetland sediments and overlying water, water flow rate (detention time), wetland size, season, climate, type of plant, and other factors.

'''Human impact''': The capacity of a wetland to store sediment, nutrients, and metals can be diminished if sediments are compacted such as by vehicles or heavy equipment, or are regularly tilled. Unnatural changes in water levels and water sources also can affect the water purification function. If water purification functions are impaired, excessive loads of nutrients enter waterways and cause [[eutrophication]]. This is of particular concern in temperate coastal systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valiela|first1=I.|last2=Collins|first2=G.|last3=Kremer|first3=J.|last4=Lajtha|first4=K.|last5=Geist|first5=M.|last6=Seely|first6=B.|last7=Brawley|first7=J.|last8=Sham|first8=C.

'''Examples:''' An example of how a natural wetland is used to provide some degree of [[sewage treatment]] is the [[East Kolkata Wetlands]] in [[Kolkata, India]]. The wetlands cover {{convert|125|km2|sqmi}}, and are used to treat Kolkata's sewage. The nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.

===Constructed wetlands===
[[File:Flintenbreite constructed wetland.jpg|thumb|Constructed wetland in an ecological settlement in Flintenbreite near Luebeck, Germany]]
{{main|Constructed wetland}}
The function of most natural wetland systems is not to manage  [[wastewater]]. However, their high potential for the filtering and the treatment of pollutants has been recognized by environmental engineers that specialize in the area of [[Wastewater treatment systems|wastewater treatment]]. These constructed wetland systems are highly controlled environments that intend to mimic the occurrences of soil, flora, and microorganisms in natural wetlands to aid in treating wastewater effluent. Constructed wetlands can be used to treat raw sewage, storm water, agricultural and [[industrial effluent]]. They are constructed with flow regimes, micro-biotic composition, and suitable plants in order to produce the most efficient treatment process. Other advantages of constructed wetlands are the control of [[retention time]]s and [[Hydraulic engineering|hydraulic]] channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brix|first=H|date=1993|contribution=Wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands: system design, removal processes, and treatment performance|editor-first=A. G.|editor-last=Moshiri|title=Constructed Wetlands for Water Quality Improvement|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important factors of constructed wetlands are the water flow processes combined with plant growth.

Constructed wetland systems can be surface flow systems with only free-floating [[macrophytes]], floating-leaved macrophytes, or submerged macrophytes; however, typical free water surface systems are usually constructed with emergent macrophytes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vymazal|first1=J.|last2=Kröpfleova|first2=L.|date=2008|title=Wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands with horizontal sub-surface flow|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=14}}{{page needed|date=January 2017|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8580-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsurface flow-constructed wetlands with a vertical or a horizontal flow regime are also common and can be integrated into urban areas as they require relatively little space.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoffmann|first1=H.|last2=Platzer|first2=C.|last3=von Münch|first3=E.|last4=Winker|first4=M.|date=2011|url=http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-930-giz2011-en-technology-review-constructed-wetlands.pdf |title=Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment|publisher=[[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]]|location=Eschborn, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reservoirs of biodiversity===

Wetland systems' rich [[biodiversity]] is becoming a focal point at International Treaty Conventions and within the [[World Wildlife Fund]] organization due to the high number of species present in wetlands, the small global geographic area of wetlands, the number of species which are [[endemic]] to wetlands, and the high productivity of wetland systems. Hundred of thousands of animal species, 20,000 of them vertebrates, are living in wetland systems. The discovery rate of fresh water fish is at 200 new species per year. The impact of maintaining biodiversity is seen at the local level through job creation, sustainability, and community productivity. A good example is the Lower Mekong basin which runs through Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam. Supporting over 55&amp;nbsp;million people, the sustainability of the region is enhanced through wildlife tours. The U.S. state of Florida has estimated that US$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion was generated in state revenue from recreational activities associated with wildlife.

'''Biodiverse river basins:''' The Amazon holds 3,000 species of freshwater fish species within the boundaries of its basin, whose function it is to disperse the seeds of trees. One of its key species, the Piramutaba catfish, ''Brachyplatystoma vaillantii'', migrates more than {{convert|3300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from its nursery grounds near the mouth of the Amazon River to its spawning grounds in Andean tributaries, {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, distributing plants seed along the route.

'''Productive intertidal zones:''' Intertidal mudflats have a level of productivity similar to that of some wetlands even while possessing a low number of species. The abundance of [[invertebrates]] found within the mud are a food source for [[migratory waterfowl]].

'''Critical life-stage habitat:''' Mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds have high levels of both species richness and productivity, and are home to important nursery areas for many commercial fish stocks.

'''Genetic diversity:''' Populations of many species are confined geographically to only one or a few wetland systems, often due to the long period of time that the wetlands have been physically isolated from other aquatic sources. For example, the number of [[endemic species]] in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia classifies it as a hotspot for biodiversity and one of the most biodiverse wetlands in the entire world. Evidence from a research study by Mazepova ''et al.'' suggest that the number of [[crustacean]] species endemic to Baikal Lake (over 690 species and subspecies) exceeds the number of the same groups of animals inhabiting all the fresh water bodies of Eurasia together. Its 150 species of free-living [[Platyhelminthes]] alone is analogous to the entire number in all of Eastern Siberia. The 34 species and subspecies number of [[Baikal sculpins]] is more than twice the number of the analogous fauna that inhabits Eurasia. One of the most exciting discoveries was made by A.&amp;nbsp;V. Shoshin who registered about 300 species of free-living [[nematodes]] using only six near-shore sampling localities in the Southern Baikal. "If we will take into consideration, that about 60% of the animals can be found nowhere else except Baikal, it may be assumed that the lake may be the biodiversity center of the Eurasian continent."&lt;ref name="Baikal"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Timoshkin|editor-first=O. A.|title=Index of animal species inhabiting Lake Baikal and its catchment area. Guides and Keys to Identification of Fauna and Flora of Lake Baikal|edition=1st|volume=1|date=2004|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Novosibirsk, Nauka|isbn=978-5-02-031736-9|work=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MUCsAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human impact:''' Biodiversity loss occurs in wetland systems through land use changes, habitat destruction, pollution, exploitation of resources, and invasive species. Vulnerable, threatened, and [[endangered species]] number at 17% of waterfowl, 38% of fresh-water dependent mammals, 33% of freshwater fish, 26% of freshwater amphibians, 72% of freshwater turtles, 86% of marine turtles, 43% of crocodilians and 27% of coral reef-building species. Introduced hydrophytes in different wetland systems can have devastating results. The introduction of [[water hyacinth]], a native plant of South America into Lake Victoria in East Africa as well as [[duckweed]] into non-native areas of Queensland, Australia, have overtaken entire wetland systems suffocating the wetlands and reducing the diversity of other plants and animals. This is largely due to their phenomenal growth rate and ability to float and grow on the surface of the water.

===Wetland products and productivity===

Wetland productivity is linked to the climate, wetland type, and nutrient availability. Low water and occasional drying of the wetland bottom during [[drought]]s (dry marsh phase) stimulate plant recruitment from a diverse [[seed bank]] and increase productivity by mobilizing nutrients. In contrast, high water during [[deluge (prehistoric)|deluge]]s (lake marsh phase) causes turnover in plant populations and creates greater interspersion of element cover and open water, but lowers overall productivity. During a cover cycle that ranges from open water to complete vegetation cover, annual net primary productivity may vary 20-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=W. C.|last2=Millett|first2=B. V.|last3=Gilmanov|first3=T.|last4=Voldseth|first4=R. A.|last5=Guntenspergen|first5=G. R.|last6=Naugle|first6=D. E.|date=2005|title=Vulnerability of Northern Prairie Wetlands to Climate Change|journal=Bio Science|volume=10|pages=863–872}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grasses of fertile floodplains such as the Nile produce the highest yield including
plants such as ''[[Arundo donax]]'' (giant reed), ''[[Cyperus papyrus]]'' (papyrus), ''[[Phragmites]]'' (reed) and ''[[Typha]]'' (cattail, bulrush).

Wetlands naturally produce an array of vegetation and other ecological products that can be harvested for personal and commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Waterlogged wealth: why waste the world's wet places?|last=Maltby|first=Edward|date=1986|publisher=International Institute for Environment and Development|others=Earthscan.|isbn=978-0905347639|location=London|oclc=18834448}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most significant of these is fish which have all or part of their life-cycle occur within a wetland system. Fresh and saltwater fish are the main source of protein for one billion people and comprise 15% of an additional two billion people's diets. In addition, fish generate a fishing industry that provides 80% of the income and employment to residents in developing countries. Another food staple found in wetland systems is rice, a popular grain that is consumed at the rate of one fifth of the total global calorie count. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam, where rice paddies are predominant on the landscape, rice consumption reach 70%.&lt;ref name="ramsar b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-documents-info/main/ramsar/1-31-59_4000_0__|title=The Ramsar Information Sheet on Wetlands of International Importance|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some native wetland plants in the Caribbean and Australia are harvested sustainably for medicinal compounds; these include the red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'') which possesses antibacterial, wound-healing, anti-ulcer effects, and antioxidant properties.&lt;ref name="ramsar b" /&gt;

Food converted to sweeteners and carbohydrates include the [[Cycas revoluta|sago palm]] of Asia and Africa (cooking oil), the [[nipa palm]] of Asia (sugar, vinegar, alcohol, and fodder) and honey collection from mangroves. More than supplemental dietary intake, this produce sustains entire villages. Coastal Thailand villages earn the key portion of their income from sugar production while the country of Cuba relocates more than 30,000 hives each year to track the seasonal flowering of the mangrove ''[[Avicennia]]''.

Other mangrove-derived products:

* Fuelwood
* Salt (produced by evaporating seawater)
* Animal fodder
* Traditional medicines (e.g. from mangrove bark)
* Fibers for textiles
* Dyes and tannins

'''Human impact:''' Over-fishing is the major problem for sustainable use of wetlands. Concerns are developing over certain aspects of farm fishing, which uses natural waterways to harvest fish for human consumption and pharmaceuticals. This practice has become especially popular in Asia and the South Pacific. Its impact upon much larger waterways downstream has negatively affected many small island developing states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/static?%20dom=root&amp;xml=index.xml] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aquaculture]] is continuing to develop rapidly throughout the Asia-Pacific region specifically in China with world holdings in Asia equal to 90% of the total number of aquaculture farms and 80% of its global value.&lt;ref name="ramsar b" /&gt; Some aquaculture has eliminated massive areas of wetland through practices seen such as in the [[shrimp farming]] industry's destruction of mangroves. Even though the damaging impact of large scale shrimp farming on the coastal ecosystem in many Asian countries has been widely recognized for quite some time now, it has proved difficult to check in absence of other employment avenues for people engaged in such occupation. Also burgeoning demand for shrimps globally has provided a large and ready market for the produce

Threats to rice fields mainly stem from inappropriate water management, introduction of invasive alien species, agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, and land use changes. Industrial-scale production of palm oil threatens the biodiversity of wetland ecosystems in parts of southeast Asia, Africa, and other developing countries.

Over-exploitation of wetland products can occur at the community level as is sometimes seen throughout coastal villages of Southern Thailand where each resident may obtain for themselves every consumable of the mangrove forest (fuelwood, timber, honey, resins, crab, and shellfish) which then becomes threatened through increasing population and continual harvest.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Additional functions and uses of wetlands ===
Some types of wetlands can serve as fire breaks that help slow the spread of minor wildfires. Larger wetland systems can influence local precipitation patterns. Some boreal wetland systems in catchment headwaters may help extend the period of flow and maintain water temperature in connected downstream waters. Pollination services are supported by many wetlands which may provide the only suitable habitat for pollinating insects, birds, and mammals in highly developed areas. It is likely that wetlands have other functions whose benefits to society and other ecosystems have yet to be discovered.

==Wetlands and climate change==
Wetlands perform two important functions in relation to climate change. They have mitigation effects through their ability to [[Carbon sink|sink carbon]], converting a greenhouse gas ([[carbon dioxide]]) to solid plant material through the process of [[photosynthesis]], and also through their ability to store and regulate water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2009|title=Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas|location=Washington, DC |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency|series=Climate Ready Estuaries Program, EPA 430-F-08-024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetlands store approximately 44.6 million tonnes of carbon per year globally.&lt;ref name="Chmura, G.

The ability of many tidal wetlands to store carbon and minimize methane flux from tidal sediments has led to sponsorship of [[blue carbon]] initiatives that are intended to enhance those processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/climate/blue-carbon/2021/|title=More on blue carbon and carbon sequestration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data on nitrous oxide fluxes from wetlands in the southern hemisphere are lacking, as are ecosystem-based studies including the role of dominant organisms that alter sediment biogeochemistry. Aquatic invertebrates produce ecologically-relevant nitrous oxide emissions due to ingestion of [[denitrifying bacteria]] that live within the subtidal sediment and water column&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stief|first1=P.|last2=Poulsen|first2=M.|last3=Nielsen|displayauthors=etal|date=2009|title=Nitrous oxide emission by aquatic macrofauna|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=106|issue=11|pages=4296–4300|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.4296S|doi=10.1073/pnas.0808228106|pmid=19255427|pmc=2651200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus may also be influencing nitrous oxide production within some wetlands.

===Peatswamps in Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, [[peatswamp forests]] and soils are being drained, burnt, mined, and overgrazed, contributing severely to climate change.&lt;ref name="wetlands"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetlands.org/|title=Wetlands International works to sustain and restore wetlands for people and biodiversity|publisher=Wetlands International|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of peat drainage, the organic carbon that was built up over thousands of years and is normally under water is suddenly exposed to the air. It decomposes and turns into [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is released into the atmosphere. Peat fires cause the same process to occur and in addition create enormous clouds of smoke that cross international borders, such as happens every year in Southeast Asia. While peatlands constitute only 3% of the world's land area, their degradation produces 7% of all [[fossil fuel]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.

Through the building of dams, [[Wetlands International]] is halting the drainage of peatlands in Southeast Asia, hoping to mitigate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Concurrent wetland restoration techniques include reforestation with native tree species as well as the formation of community fire brigades. This sustainable approach can be seen in central [[Kalimantan]] and [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]].

== Wetland Disturbance ==

Wetlands, the functions and services they provide as well as their flora and fauna, can be affected by several types of disturbances. The disturbances (sometimes termed stressors or alterations) can be human-associated or natural, direct or indirect, reversible or not, and isolated or cumulative. When exceeding levels or patterns normally found within wetlands of a particular class in a particular region, the predominant ones include the following&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?dirEntryID=39147|title=Impacts on quality of inland wetlands of the United States: A survey of indicators, techniques, and applications of community-level biomonitoring data |author=Office of Research &amp; Development|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323993409|title=Indicators for Monitoring Biological Integrity of Inland Freshwater Wetlands: A Survey of North American Technical Literature (1990-2000)|last=Adamus|first=Paul|last2=J.

Disturbances can be further categorized as follows:

;Minor disturbance

;Moderate disturbance
:Ecosystem integrity is damaged but can recover in time without assistance.&lt;ref name="clewell2013" /&gt;
;Impairment or severe disturbance
:Human intervention may be needed in order for ecosystem to recover.&lt;ref name="clewell2013" /&gt;

Just a few of the many sources of these disturbances are&lt;ref name="wetlands" /&gt;

** Drainage
** Development
** Over-grazing
**[[Mining]]
** Unsustainable water use
*They can be manifested partly as:
**[[Water Scarcity]]
**[[Endangered|Impacts to Endangered]] species
** Disruption of wildlife breeding grounds
** Imbalance in sediment load and nutrient filtration

Wetlands have historically been the victim of large draining efforts for [[real estate development]], or [[flooding]] for use as recreational [[lake]]s or [[hydropower]] generation. Some of the world's most important agricultural areas are wetlands that have been converted to farmland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=G.

In order to maintain wetlands and sustain their functions, alterations and disturbances that are outside the normal range of variation should be minimized.

===Balancing wetland conservation with the needs of people===
Wetlands are vital ecosystems that provide livelihoods for the millions of people who live in and around them. The [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) called for different sectors to join forces to secure wetland environments in the context of sustainable development and improving human wellbeing. A three-year project carried out by Wetlands International in partnership with the [[International Water Management Institute]] found that it is possible to conserve wetlands while improving the livelihoods of people living among them. Case studies conducted in Malawi and Zambia looked at how [[dambo]]s – wet, grassy valleys or depressions where water seeps to the surface – can be farmed sustainably to improve livelihoods. Mismanaged or overused dambos often become degraded, however, using a knowledge exchange between local farmers and environmental managers, a protocol was developed using soil and water management practices. Project outcomes included a high yield of crops, development of sustainable farming techniques, and adequate water management generating enough water for use as irrigation. Before the project, there were cases where people had died from starvation due to food shortages. By the end of it, many more people had access to enough water to grow vegetables. A key achievement was that villagers had secure food supplies during long, dry months. They also benefited in other ways: nutrition was improved by growing a wider range of crops, and villagers could also invest in health and education by selling produce and saving money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Good practices and lessons learned in integrating ecosystem conservation and poverty reduction objectives in wetlands|url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/wn/w.n.iwmi_poverty_report.pdf|publisher=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands|accessdate= 2011-11-19|date=2008-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramsar Convention===
{{Main|Ramsar Convention|List of Ramsar wetlands of international importance}}
''The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat'', or Ramsar Convention, is an international [[treaty]] designed to address global concerns regarding wetland loss and degradation. The primary purposes of the treaty are to list wetlands of international importance and to promote their wise use, with the ultimate goal of preserving the world's wetlands. Methods include restricting access to the majority portion of wetland areas, as well as educating the public to combat the misconception that wetlands are wastelands. The Convention works closely with five International Organisation Partners. These are: [[Birdlife International]], the [[IUCN]], the [[International Water Management Institute]], [[Wetlands International]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]. The partners provide technical expertise, help conduct or facilitate field studies and provide financial support. The IOPs also participate regularly as observers in all meetings of the Conference of the Parties and the Standing Committee and as full members of the Scientific and Technical Review Panel.

==Valuation==

The value of a wetland to local communities, as well as the value of wetland systems generally to the earth and to humankind, is one of the most important valuations that can be conducted for [[sustainable development]]. This typically involves first mapping a region's wetlands, then assessing the functions and ecosystem services the wetlands provide individually and cumulatively, and evaluating that information to prioritize or rank individual wetlands or wetland types for conservation, management, restoration, or development. Over a longer period, it requires keeping inventories of known wetlands and monitoring a representative sample of the wetlands to determine changes due to both natural and human factors. Such a valuation process is used to educate decision-makers such as governments of the importance of particular wetlands within their jurisdiction.

===Assessment===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Rapid assessment methods are used to score, rank, rate, or categorize various functions, [[ecosystem services]], species, communities, levels of disturbance, and/or [[ecological health]] of a wetland or group of wetlands. This is often done to prioritize particular wetlands for conservation (avoidance) or to determine the degree to which loss or alteration of wetland functions should be compensated, such as by restoring degraded wetlands elsewhere or providing additional protections to existing wetlands. Rapid assessment methods are also applied before and after a wetland has been restored or altered, to help monitor or predict the effects of those actions on various wetland functions and the services they provide. Assessments are typically considered to be "rapid" when they require only a single visit to the wetland lasting less than one day, which in some cases may include interpretation of aerial imagery and [[GIS]] analyses of existing spatial data, but not detailed post-visit laboratory analyses of water or biological samples. Due to time and cost constraints, the levels of various wetland functions or other attributes are usually not measured directly but rather are estimated relative to other assessed wetlands in a region, using observation-based variables, sometimes called "indicators", that are hypothesized or known to predict performance of the specified functions or attributes.

To achieve consistency among persons doing the assessment, rapid methods present indicator variables as questions or checklists on standardized data forms, and most methods standardize the scoring or rating procedure that is used to combine question responses into estimates of the levels of specified functions relative to the levels estimated in other wetlands ("calibration sites") assessed previously in a region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://people.oregonstate.edu/~adamusp/WESP/Manual_WESP1.3_13Oct2016_Adamus.pdf |title=Manual for the Wetland Ecosystem Services Protocol (WESP)|last=Adamus|first=P. |date= 2016|website=Oregon State University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid assessment methods, partly because they often use dozens of indicators pertaining to conditions surrounding a wetland as well as within the wetland itself, aim to provide estimates of wetland functions and services that are more accurate and repeatable than simply describing a wetland's class type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= |chapter= |editor=Dorney, J. |editor2=Savage, R. |editor3=Tiner, R.W. |editor4=Adamus, P. |title=Wetland and Stream Rapid Assessments: Development, Validation, and Application |date=2018 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-12-805091-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A need for wetland assessments to be rapid arises mostly when government agencies set deadlines for decisions affecting a wetland, or when the number of wetlands needing information on their functions or condition is large.

In North America and a few other countries, standardized rapid assessment methods for wetlands have a long history, having been developed, calibrated, tested, and applied to varying degrees in several different regions and wetland types since the 1970s. However, few rapid assessment methods have been fully validated. Done correctly, validation is a very expensive endeavor that involves comparing rankings of a series of wetlands based on results from rapid assessment methods with rankings based on less rapid and considerably more costly, multi-visit, detailed measurements of levels of the same functions or other attributes in the same series of wetlands.

===Inventory===

Although developing a global inventory of wetlands has proven to be a large and difficult undertaking, many efforts at more local scales have been successful. Current efforts are based on available data, but both classification and spatial resolution have sometimes proven to be inadequate for regional or site-specific environmental management decision-making. It is difficult to identify small, long, and narrow wetlands within the landscape. Many of today's remote sensing satellites do not have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to monitor wetland conditions, although multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data may offer improved spatial resolutions once it is 4&amp;nbsp;m or higher. Majority of the pixels are just mixtures of several plant species or vegetation types and are difficult to isolate which translates into an inability to classify the vegetation that defines the wetland. Improved remote sensing information, coupled with good knowledge domain on wetlands will facilitate expanded efforts in wetland monitoring and mapping. This will also be extremely important because we expect to see major shifts in species composition due to both anthropogenic land use and natural changes in the environment caused by climate change.

===Monitoring===

A wetland needs to be monitored over time to assess whether it is functioning at an ecologically sustainable level or whether it is becoming degraded. Degraded wetlands will suffer a loss in water quality, loss of sensitive species, and aberrant functioning of soil geochemical processes.

'''Mapping'''

Practically, many natural wetlands are difficult to monitor from the ground as they are quite often are difficult to access and may require exposure to dangerous plants and animals as well as diseases borne by insects or other invertebrates..Therefore, mapping using aerial imagery is one effective tool to monitor a wetland, especially a large wetland, and can also be used to monitor the status of numerous wetlands throughout a watershed or region. Many remote sensing methods can be used to map wetlands. Remote-sensing technology permits the acquisition of timely digital data on a repetitive basis. This repeat coverage allows wetlands, as well as the adjacent land-cover and land-use types, to be monitored seasonally and/or annually. Using digital data provides a standardized data-collection procedure and an opportunity for data integration within a [[geographic information system]]. Traditionally, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and the SPOT 4 and 5 satellite systems have been used for this purpose. More recently, however, multispectral IKONOS and QuickBird data, with spatial resolutions of {{convert|4|by|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.44|by|2.44|m|ft|abbr=on}}, respectively, have been shown to be excellent sources of data when mapping and monitoring smaller wetland habitats and vegetation communities.

For example, Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District assessed area wetlands in Michigan, USA, using remote sensing. Through using this technology, satellite images were taken over a large geographic area and extended period. In addition, using this technique was less costly and time-consuming compared to the older method using visual interpretation of [[aerial photographs]]. In comparison, most aerial photographs also require experienced interpreters to extract information based on structure and texture while the interpretation of remote sensing data only requires analysis of one characteristic (spectral).

However, there are a number of limitations associated with this type of image acquisition. Analysis of wetlands has proved difficult because to obtain the data it is often linked to other purposes such as the analysis of land cover or land use.

'''Further improvements'''

Methods to develop a classification system for specific biota of interest could assist with technological advances that will allow for identification at a very high accuracy rate. The issue of the cost and expertise involved in remote sensing technology is still a factor hindering further advancements in image acquisition and data processing. Future improvements in current wetland vegetation mapping could include the use of more recent and better geospatial data when it is available.

==Restoration==
Restoration and [[Restoration ecology|restoration ecologists]] intend to return wetlands to their natural trajectory by aiding directly with the natural processes of the ecosystem.&lt;ref name=clewell2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clewell|first1=AF|last2=Aronson|first2=J|title=Ecological restoration|date=2013|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; These direct methods vary with respect to the degree of physical manipulation of the natural environment and each are associated with different levels of restoration.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Restoration is needed after disturbance or [[Disturbance (ecology)|perturbation]] of a wetland.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Disturbances include [[Exogeny|exogenous]] factors such as flooding or drought.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Other external damage may be [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbance caused by clear-cut harvesting of trees, oil and gas extraction, poorly defined infrastructure installation, over grazing of livestock, ill-considered recreational activities, alteration of wetlands including dredging, draining, and filling, and other negative human impacts.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="mitsch2007" /&gt; Disturbance puts different levels of stress on an environment depending on the type and duration of disturbance.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; There is no one way to restore a wetland and the level of restoration required will be based on the level of disturbance although, each method of restoration does require preparation and administration.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;

===Levels of restoration===
;Factors influencing selected approach may include&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
*Budget
*Time scale limitations
*Project goals
*Level of disturbance
*Landscape and ecological constraints
*Political and administrative agendas
*Socioeconomic priorities

# '''Prescribed Natural Regeneration'''
#: There are no biophysical manipulation and the ecosystem is left to recover based on the process of [[Ecological succession|succession]] alone.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; The focus of this method is to eliminate and prevent further disturbance from occurring.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; In order for this type of restoration to be effective and successful there must be prior research done to understand the probability that the wetland will recover with this method.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Otherwise, some biophysical manipulation may be required to enhance the rate of succession to an acceptable level determined by the project managers and ecologists.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; This is likely to be the first method of approach for the lowest level of disturbance being that it is the least intrusive and least costly.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; 
# '''Assisted Natural Regeneration'''
#: There are some biophysical manipulations however they are non-intrusive.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Example methods that are not limited to wetlands include prescribed burns to small areas, promotion of site specific soil [[microbiota]] and plant growth using nucleation planting whereby plants radiate from an initial planting site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corbin|first1=JD|last2=Holl|first2=KD|title=Applied nucleation as a forest restoration strategy|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|date=2012|volume=256|pages=37–46|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2011.10.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of niche diversity or increasing the range of niches to promote use by a variety of different species.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; These methods can make it easier for the natural species to flourish by removing competition from their environment and can speed up the process of succession.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
# '''Partial Reconstruction'''
#: Here there is a mix between natural regeneration and manipulated environmental control.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; These manipulations may require some engineering and more invasive biophysical manipulation including ripping of [[subsoil]], [[Agrochemical|agrichemical]] applications such as herbicides and insecticides, laying of mulch, mechanical seed dispersal, and tree planting on a large scale.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; In these circumstances the wetland is impaired and without human assistance it would not recover within an acceptable period of time determined by ecologists.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Again these methods of restoration will have to be considered on a site by site basis as each site will require a different approach based on levels of disturbance and ecosystem dynamics.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;
# '''Complete Reconstruction'''
#: The most expensive and intrusive method of reconstruction requiring engineering and ground up reconstruction.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt; Because there is a redesign of the entire ecosystem it is important that the natural trajectory of the ecosystem be considered and that the plant species will eventually return the ecosystem towards its natural trajectory.&lt;ref name=clewell2013 /&gt;

=== Important considerations ===

* Constructed wetlands can take 10–100 years to fully resemble the vegetative composition of a natural wetland.
* Artificial wetlands do not have hydric soil. The soil has very low levels of organic carbon and total nitrogen compared to natural wetland systems, and this reduces the performance of several functions.
* Organic matter added to degraded natural wetlands can in some cases help restore their productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=T. M.|last2=Davis|first2=S.

'''''When Bad Things Happen to Good People''''' ({{ISBN|1-4000-3472-8}}) is a 1981 book by [[Harold Kushner]], a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]].  Kushner addresses in the book one of the principal problems of [[theodicy]], the conundrum of why, if the universe was created and is governed by a [[God]] who is of a good and loving nature, there is nonetheless so much suffering and pain in it - essentially, the evidential [[problem of evil]].

The book is dedicated to the memory of his young son, Aaron, who died at the age of 14 in 1977 of the incurable genetic disease [[progeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080803/TWIST01/808030320/1128/twist]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rabbi Kushner's book was a ''New York Times'' bestseller for many months in the "nonfiction" category.

==Thesis==
Kushner seeks to offer comfort to grieving people. His answer to the philosophical problem is that God does his best and is with people in their suffering, but is not fully able to prevent it.&lt;ref name=Frame&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Frame|authorlink1=John Frame (theologian)|title=Apologetics to the Glory of God|date=1994|isbn=0-87552-243-2|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kushner’s beliefs, which seem to question God’s [[omnipotence]], have been criticized by some conservative scholars associated with [[Orthodox Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Y. Kirzner, ''Making Sense of Suffering'' {{ISBN|1-57819-757-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[evangelical Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Frame" /&gt;

==Recognition==
*''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller, "nonfiction"
