==Plot==
In 1967 in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica, CA]], John Form, a doctor, presents his expectant wife Mia with a rare vintage porcelain doll as a gift for their first child to be placed in a collection of dolls in their daughter's nursery.

That night, the couple is disturbed by the sounds of their next door neighbors, the Higgins, being murdered during a home invasion. While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins' killers. The police arrive and shoot one killer, a man, dead while the female killer commits suicide by slitting her own throat inside the nursery while holding the porcelain doll. News reports identify the assailants as the Higgins' estranged daughter, Annabelle, and her unidentified boyfriend, both members of a cult.

In the days following the attack, a series of paranormal activities occur around the Form's residence. Afterwards, Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She and John name their child Leah. The family rents an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelle's previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plagues Mia and her daughter. The next night, Mia is haunted by a malevolent presence in her apartment and believes it to be Annabelle's ghost. During a storm, Mia encounters an enigmatic figure in the building's basement who begins pursuing her before she escapes.

Mia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultist and learns that the cult intends to [[Evocation|summon supernatural beings]]. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], which summoned a [[demon]] who followed the family after they moved to their apartment in order to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|the Warrens]] for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.

The priest is hospitalized on the next day and, when John checks on him, Father Perez warns the latter that after sensing its powerful presence, the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul. That night, while Evelyn is visiting Mia, the demon uses Father Perez's physical form to sneak into the apartment and abduct Leah in exchange for her mother's soul. To spare her daughter, Mia attempts to jump out of the window with the doll but John arrives in time along with Evelyn to stop her. Evelyn decides to take her own life in Mia's place instead as atonement for causing a car accident that resulted in the death of her daughter Ruby years ago. As the Forms are reunited, the demon and the doll disappear, while Leah is safely inside her crib.

Six months later, the doll is bought from an antique shop by a mother as a gift for her daughter Debbie, one of the nursing students from the prelude of the [[The Conjuring|first film]].

==Production==

===Development===
The film is a spin-off of the 2013 horror film ''[[The Conjuring]]'', focusing on the origins of the Annabelle doll found in that film. The film was designed to be stand alone yet at the same time catering to fans of "The Conjuring" who would already be familiar with the latter film.&lt;ref name="Backstage"/&gt; According to Backstage.com, the film was one of the first in a new strategy by distributors Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema "that capitalizes on the built-in fan bases for successful films, allowing for smaller budgets and production time with a bigger payout on the back end."&lt;ref name="Backstage"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Briana |title=1 Strategy That Helps ''Annabelle'' Director John R.

===Critical response===
''Annabelle'' received generally negative reviews from critics, the majority of which felt the film inferior to its [[The Conjuring|predecessor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-annabelle-movie-reviews-critics-20141002-story.html |title=''Annabelle'': Horror prequel scares up lackluster reviews |first=Oliver |last=Lackluster |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 3, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports an approval rating of 29% based on 125 reviews, with an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 4.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Annabelle'' borrows unabashedly from better horror films, content to leave viewers with a string of cheap jolts that fail to build on the far more effective ''The Conjuring''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/annabelle/ |title=Annabelle (2014) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/annabelle |title=Annabelle |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film a grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Scheck of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the film for its cheap production and screenplay, but was positive towards the performances of the cast and saying, "the film is ultimately so scary and formulaic that you won't forget it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/annabelle/review/737562 |title=''Annabelle'': Film Review |first=Frank |last=Scheck |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a positive review, calling the film "inspired" but periodically cheap. He added "a cut-rate spinoff from James Wan's superlative haunted-house hit ''The Conjuring'' that (partly) makes up in crude shock effects, but lacks in atmosphere. Designed mainly as a starring vehicle for the eponymous, creepy-as-hell doll (who easily outclasses her human co-stars), this WB/New Line quickie is the thirst of die-hard genre fans and is by the far the best horror movie of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-annabelle-1201319522/ |title=Film Review: ''Annabelle'' |first=Scott |last=Foundas |website=Variety |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pete Hammond of ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' gave the film a positive review and said that the scary doll show has left him pining for [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] in ''[[Child's Play (1988 film)|Child's Play]]''. He further added, "''Annabelle'' may still draw horror fans in this Halloween month, and they will be quaking over the scares in this film."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/annabelle-review-the-conjuring-prequel-pete-hammond-845104/ |title=''Annabelle'' Review: Pete Hammond On Scary ''The Conjuring'' Prequel |last=Hammond |first=Pete |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Armored Brigade''''' is a real-time tactical wargame, focusing on realism and playability. The first incarnation of the game was published in 2008 and the most recent version was released in January 2016; marking last freeware version to be published. A commercial version, including drastic gameplay improvements, new features and reworked unit and terrain graphics is being actively developed with scheduled completion during the fall of 2018. 

Players control individual tanks and vehicles from a top-down perspective, on a zoomable map. Infantry are mostly in squad/section sized units. The whole force under a player's control ranges from platoon level upwards, depending on battle options.

The games are single player against the AI.

==Gameplay==

June 18, 1987. Across a birch-dotted valley somewhere in Eastern Europe, a line of US APCs nervously scurry. The friendly scout teams on the wooded slopes ahead hear the rumble of thunder first, but by then it's much too late. Two MiG 21s are overhead in an instant, cluster bombs tumbling from their wings as they pass. In the welter of detonations, three APCs shudder to a halt. The surviving vehicles race for the treeline and disgorge their passengers while Vulcan mini-guns spew leaden fury at the fast-fleeing aircraft.

The first exchange in a typically tense Armored Brigade battle.

Armored Brigade simulates modern combined-arms combat from platoon to regiment/brigade level from a top-down perspective. Freeware version only represented a hypothetical [[World War III]] scenario in 1987, while commercial edition covers all years from 1965 to 1991. Sides available are the US, USSR, West and East Germany, UK, Finland and Poland. There are plans to add more nations (freeware version had 11 nations, but limited to a single year) and open up the timescale, including [[World War II]].

Players can control individual vehicles, platoons and companies. Infantry is mostly in squad/section sized units. The game includes a wide variety of accurately researched and historical squads, weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and artillery.

Unit morale, experience level and fatigue, command delay, a wide set of weapon and vehicle parameters are all taken into account to produce realistic combat simulation.

A wide range of orders are available supplemented by a set of [[Standard Operating Procedure]]s, like different rates of fire, engagement ranges and dismount policy. Furthermore, units can be organized into nine formations, with customizable spacing between individual vehicles.

The current version of the game includes large real world terrain maps, representing areas likely to be involved in a [[Cold War]] engagement, including the [[Fulda Gap]] and [[North German Plain]].

Up to 0.801 beta version, maps could be randomly generated — either by the built-in map generator with a number of different settings or by an external tool like [[Terragen]] (from version 0.704a). Afterwards, real terrain maps were introduced, generated from satellite data. Their size can vary from 2x2 to 15x15 kilometres, on an area covering initially about 7,300 square kilometres, and soon afterwards increased to 30,000 square kilometres. Different terrain sets for summer, autumn and winter seasons are available. Also included are desert, tropical and "nuclear wasteland" sets. Real world elevation data can also be read by the game to generate accurate maps of anywhere in the world.

The game features a dynamic time of day and variable visibility, with the weather, including night and storm, influencing the battle and ground conditions. Other interesting features are [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] battlefield overview and civilian units.

The games are currently single player against the AI. The AI is able to analyse terrain both in offensive and defensive operations, and conduct manoeuvres according to one of predetermined routines - Armored, Mechanized or Infantry with emphasis placed on the corresponding unit type. new features make Armored Brigade definitely the most realistic Cold War themed tactical level wargame to date.

==Reception==
The game has been widely praised by critics, even in its still early incarnation. It has been favourably compared to [[Steel Panthers]], [[Combat Mission (video game series)|Combat Mission Series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/03/30/armored-brigade/|title=Armored Brigade|author=Tim Stone|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Close Combat series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peerpressureworks.com/2008/11/16/look-ma-not-every-goddamn-game-is-a-50-drm-riddled-disaster/ |title=Look, Ma, Not Every Goddamn Game is a $50 DRM-Riddled Disaster! |author=Geektastic |publisher=Peer Pressure Works |date=2008-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419063116/http://www.peerpressureworks.com/2008/11/16/look-ma-not-every-goddamn-game-is-a-50-drm-riddled-disaster/ |archivedate=2011-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer and Video Games|CVG]] said "hides convincing Cold War combat drama under unassuming 2D top-down visuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/203749/features/complimentary-campaigning/|title=Complimentary Campaigning|author=Tim Stone|publisher=CVG|date=2008-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, game was reviewed and positively rated among others by Eurogamer.dk and Ekstra Bladet, the biggest newspaper in Denmark. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/kup/elektronik/spil/article4737309.ece|title=Krigsspil: Warszawa-Pagten mod NATO|author=Martin Wiinholt|publisher=Ekstra Bladet|date=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modding==
From 0.697c onward, all data base entries are externalized in [[XML]] format and thus are open for [[modding]]. Small mods are already available at official forum and more can be expected as game reaches version 1.0. Commercial version will include full editor.

The '''Boswell Wilkie Circus''' was in business for close to 75 years in South Africa.&lt;ref name="News 24"&gt;{{cite web|title=Boswell Wilkie Circus to close|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Boswell-Wilkie-Circus-to-close-20010917|publisher=News 24|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circus origins==
The Boswell family started the show in 1913 in [[Vrededorp, Gauteng|Vrededorp]], a [[Johannesburg]] suburb. The family did most of the entertainment. Jim, Walter and Alf did tumbling acts while Walter and Alf were clowns. Jim leaped from the springboard over ten ponies and they showed ponies, donkeys and dogs.&lt;ref name="Circus Federation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ricketts|first1=Charles|title=The Boswells: The Story of a South African Circus|url=http://www.circusfederation.org/uploads/circus_culture/about/southafrica_boswells.pdf|publisher=Circus Federation|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the first shows to allow racially mixed audiences and it became a staple in South Africa. It was one of the first to defy the [[apartheid]] government's ban on Sunday entertainment. Wilkie's daughter Susie began performing when she was three and her brother, Robert, was the youngest person to become a circus director and manager.&lt;ref name="News 24" /&gt;

==First World War==
During the First World War, the circus didn't perform much. From 1916 and after, the Boswells became known as the Boswell Brothers Circus and Menagerie, and they would eventually be called just the Bowsell's Circus.&lt;ref name="Circus Federation" /&gt;

==Between the wars==

In 1919, the Boswells had their first show since the war in Durban. The Boswells started to put effort into enlarging their circus. The first [[Asian elephant]] was bought in 1921 from Frank Willison, an American who had a circus in [[Madagascar]]. Jim also started training his first lion group.&lt;ref name="Circus Federation" /&gt; In 1924 Boswell’s Circus undertook a tour that took them through Southern and Northern Rhodesia (now [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), [[Mozambique]], and up into the Belgian Congo for the first time.&lt;ref name="Circus Federation" /&gt; In 1932, during the worldwide recession, the Boswells held special charity performances in [[Durban]]. They gave a show in aid of the unemployed with the patronage of the Governor-General and the Countess of Clarendon.&lt;ref name="Circus Federation" /&gt; They also allowed unemployed people to sleep in the tent and they put on a performance for 1000 poor children and the elderly.

==Second World War==
In 1941 there was great interest in the 21-year-old Helen Ayres of Pretoria. She handled the lions with great courage. She was the wife of Stanley, having married him in 1939.&lt;ref name="Circus Federation" /&gt; Three of the four original Boswell brothers retired in 1942.

==After the war==
In 1953, the Boswell family entered into an agreement with the African Consolidated Theatres Organization.&lt;ref name="Circus Federation" /&gt; In November 1963, Jim and Syd Boswell sold the rest of their shares to the African Theatres. The terms of the settlement included that it would now be known as the Boswell-Wilkie Circus.

==Circus closing==
The Boswell Wilkie Circus had its final show in October 2001. After difficult economic times in South Africa, the circus announced that the touring side would stop. Their final performance was on 13 October in [[Alberton, Gauteng]]. The circus then moved to [[Randvaal]]. The circus continued to perform just for corporate functions and Christmas parties.&lt;ref name="News 24" /&gt;

==Taking down of the Big Top Tent at Randvaal==
The below is a post from their website as a last good bye:
It is with great sadness that the Wilkie family have to announce that after many years of the Big top standing on the Boswell Wilkie Circus farm in Randvaal, the beloved Big Top, that holds so many precious memories for those young and old, will be taken down on 10 December 2015.

After years under the hot South African sun, the circus Big Top has seen its last days in the spotlight and will unfortunately be retiring. The family have made the difficult decision not to replace the Big Top, which means that they will no longer have circus participation parties and school outings. We will, however, continue to host parties in the beautiful gardens of Café du Cirque, as well as in our newly renovated rustic stables venue, where the kiddies can enjoy the jungle gym, pony rides or perhaps even a clown. We do have a few tricks up our sleeves and we are currently working on a new project for children’s parties. Updates will be posted on the Café du Cirque Facebook page.

The Wilkie’s are still, however, keeping the circus alive, and have a vast variety of performers available for private and corporate events.

We encourage you all to come and say your nostalgic goodbyes and take your last photographs with our beautiful Italian Big Top. We are open Tuesdays – Fridays from 10h00 to 17h00, and Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays from 08h00 to 17h00.

==Background==
Following the release of her single "[[100 Grados]]", In April 2018 Lali announced that she was going to tour later that year. While still touring with her [[Lali en Vivo]], a second date at the [[Estadio Luna Park|Luna Park Arena]] had to be added due to high demand. Argentine, Uruguayan and Chilean dates were announced in the following weeks.&lt;ref name="BravaTour"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filo.news/espectaculos/Lali-Esposito-anuncio-las-fechas-de-su-proxima-gira-20180615-0054.html|title=Lali Espósito anunció las fechas de su próxima gira|accessdate=24 August 2018|date=15 June 2018|work=Filo News|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8470843/lali-esposito-new-album-brava-track-by-track-review-interview|title=Lali Esposito Talks New Album, 'Brava,' &amp; Track by Track Review|accessdate=24 August 2018|date=17 August 2018|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|first=Santiago|last=Torres}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mundotkm.com/globalmusica/2018/06/14/lali-esposito-brava-tour/|title=Lali Espósito arranca el Brava Tour en agosto|accessdate=24 August 2018|work=TKM|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concert synopsis==
The show begins when a video introduction is displayed on the huge vertical [[LED display|LED screen]]. The stage simulates to be a garden of eight meters high and sixteen meters wide, surrounded by gigantic [[Rose|roses]] and lips, representing the aesthetics of the album. After the phrase "Soy brava, babies" (English: "I'm fierce, babies") is heard, Lali appears onstage wearing a golden sequin [[Bodysuit|bodysuit]] and a fringed jacket to perform "OMG!". The first set also includes "[[A Bailar (Lali Espósito song)|A Bailar]]", "[[Histeria (song)|Histeria]]", "Irresistible" and "[[Soy (song)|Soy]]". Lali changes her clothes to perform "Besarte Mucho", accompanied by a sexy choreography. Then, she performs "Somos Amantes", while images of her legs and her body are seen on the main screen. Previous to "Salvaje", she performs a sexy solo dance number on top of rotating platform. After "[[Sin Querer Queriendo]]", Lali performs [[Dance music|dance]] remixes of "[[Boomerang (Lali Espósito song)|Boomerang]]", "[[Mil Años Luz (Lali Espósito song)|Mil Años Luz]]", "Mi Religión" and "[[Asesina (Lali Espósito song)|Asesina]]", and leaves the stage.

The party mood slows down as Lali reappears onstage wearing a long dress and accompanied by a piano to perform "Reina", "[[Unico (song)|Unico]]" and "Vuelve a Mi". Lali's back up dancers perform a dance interlude while their names appears on the screen. Once again, Lali comes back to the stage to perform "[[100 Grados]]". For "Tu Revolución", the lights of the arena turn green as a symbol of the [[Abortion in Argentina|pro-legal abortion movement in Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com.ar/2165369-el-panuelazo-verde-de-lali-en-el-luna-park|title=El pañuelazo verde de Lali en el Luna Park|first=Gabriel|last=Orqueda|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone Argentina]]|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Lali performs "Bomba" and "[[Caliente (Lali song)|Caliente]]", the mood rises again. Following "Mi Última Canción" and "[[Una Na]]", Lali appears onstage wearing a long-champagne color dress to perform an acoustic set of her ballads "Tu Sonrisa", "Cielo Salvador", "Cree en Mí" and "[[Del Otro Lado (Lali Espósito song)|Del Otro Lado]]". When the show seems to have finished, Lali returns once again to perform "[[Ego (Lali Espósito song)|Ego]]", "[[No Estoy Sola]]" and "Amor Es Presente", wearing pink top and skirt. After two and a half hours, and having performed thirty-one songs, Lali performs "Tu Novia" while confetti rains from the ceiling. She disappears from the stage from the last time, and the big screen displays the word "Brava", indicating that the show has finished.&lt;ref name="Clarin"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/espectaculos/musica/nueva-lali-esposito-hizo-explotar-luna_0_rkHuvxpLQ.html|title=La nueva Lali Espósito hizo explotar el Luna|work=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DiaroShow"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.diarioshow.com/musica/La-gran-bestia-brava-pop-20180824-0009.html|title=La gran bestia brava pop|work=DiarioShow|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lanacion.com.ar/2165317-lali-esposito-mas-brava-nunca-flasheo-su|title=Lali Espósito, más brava que nunca, "flasheó" a su público en el Luna Park|last=Talesnik|first=Tamara|work=[[La Nación]]|accessdate=24 August 2018|date=24 August 2018|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cambio''' is a pop culture website for primarily for female millennials - "for girls, #builtbygirls", owned and operated by [[Oath Inc.]].

'''Dennis Taylor''' (born '''Denis Taylor''', 19 January 1949 in [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]) is a retired professional [[snooker]] player and current [[BBC]] snooker commentator. 

Winner of two [[Snooker world rankings|ranking events]], he is best known for winning the [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|1985 World Championship]], beating [[List of world number one snooker players|World number one]] [[Steve Davis]] on the final black in one of the sport's most memorable finals. He also won the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Grand Prix]] in 1984 and the [[Masters (snooker)|Masters]] in 1987. Taylor is also well known for his sense of humour and his trademark oversized spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Snooker legend Dennis Taylor to meet East Lancashire teenagers|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/10631771.Snooker_legend_Dennis_Taylor_to_meet_East_Lancashire_teenagers/|accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made regular appearances on the snooker game show ''[[Big Break]]''.

==Career==

===Early career===
Taylor turned professional in 1972 and made his world championship debut in [[World Snooker Championship 1973|1973]], narrowly losing to [[Cliff Thorburn]] in the first round.&lt;ref name="GSC profile"&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Masters: Dennis Taylor|url=http://www.globalsnookercentre.co.uk/files/Players/Global_Europe/Global_Ireland/ni_dennis_taylor.htm|publisher=Global Snooker Centre|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222215337/http://www.globalsnookercentre.co.uk/files/Players/Global_Europe/Global_Ireland/ni_dennis_taylor.htm|archivedate=22 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After world semi-final losses in 1975 and 1977, Taylor reached his first major final – the World Championship – in [[World Snooker Championship 1979|1979]], but lost 24–16 to debutant [[Terry Griffiths]].&lt;ref name="GSC profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WS profile"&gt;{{World Snooker|senior|13165~2234125,00|30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having reached the semi final of the World Championships in 1984, losing to Steve Davis, Taylor was playing very well as he began the 1984–85 season. In September, however, he was devastated by the sudden death of his mother, which caused him to withdraw from the Jameson International. His first ranking event win came later in 1984, when he won the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Rothmans Grand Prix]] by beating [[Cliff Thorburn]] 10–2 in the final.

===The 1985 final===

Later that season he reached his second world final in [[1985 World Snooker Championship final|1985]], where he faced Steve Davis, world number one, reigning world champion and the dominant player of the 1980s. Taylor trailed 0–8 after the first session, but bounced back to trail 7–9 and 15–17 and then level at 17–17. In an incredibly tense final frame, the score was 62–44 to Davis with only the brown, blue, pink and black still on the table. While Davis needed only the brown, Taylor needed all the colours. He potted a long brown, which he says was one of his best ever shots under pressure.

A tricky blue and a difficult pink also went in, bringing the score to 62–59 to ensure that, for the first time ever, the title would be decided on the black ball. Taylor eventually potted the black after Davis had missed a tricky cut into the top pocket and, amid euphoric scenes watched by over 18 million viewers well after midnight on live BBC television, took the title at the relatively advanced age of 36.

Davis later drily commented that the match had all been there "in black and white". The World Championship win added to Taylor's popularity. On his return to Coalisland with the world trophy he was mobbed by the town's inhabitants, and he appeared widely on television thereafter.

===Later career===
Taylor reached the [[Grand Prix (snooker)|Rothmans Grand Prix]] final again in autumn 1985, and again faced Davis in a match that went to a deciding frame, but this time was beaten 10–9. As with all other first-time world champions so far, Taylor succumbed to the "[[Crucible curse]]" on his return to the [[Crucible Theatre]] [[World Snooker Championship 1986|the following year]] and lost 10–6 to [[Mike Hallett]] in the opening match, humorously acknowledging defeat by putting his handkerchief on the end of his cue to resemble a [[white flag]]. He won the [[Masters (snooker)|Benson &amp; Hedges Masters]] in 1987, beating [[Alex Higgins]] 9–8 in the final, having trailed 8-5. Taylor often credits his comeback win to having heard that Higgins's manager had ordered a [[Wall's (ice cream)|Wall's]] [[Viennetta]] to celebrate their impending victory.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Taylor had a well-publicized row with Higgins at the 1990 snooker World Cup in which the Northern Ireland team were beaten by Canada in the final, which ended with Higgins threatening to have Taylor shot, a threat Taylor understandably took seriously since he and Higgins belonged to opposite sides of Northern Ireland's [[sectarianism|sectarian]] [[The Troubles|divide]]. Shortly afterwards they met in the quarter-finals of the [[1990 Irish Masters|Irish Masters]], and a determined Taylor won 5–2. The match was attended by a young [[Ken Doherty]]. Taylor also beat [[Jimmy White]] 6–5 in the semi-finals but, emotionally drained by the Higgins match, lost 9–4 to Davis in the final. Taylor and Higgins were later reconciled.

Taylor and Davis met in the World Championship for a second time in 1991, this time in the quarter-finals. Davis won this match 13-7 to advance to the semi-final.

Taylor was renowned for the glasses he wore during matches, with their large frame and unusual 'upside-down' structure that is required to avoid a player looking over the top of the lenses when down on a shot. As a member of the [[Matchroom]] group of players (managed by promoter [[Barry Hearn]]), Taylor performed on the hit single with [[Chas &amp; Dave]], "[[Snooker Loopy]]", which peaked at #5 in the UK singles chart. His perceived bad eyesight was parodied in the song with the lines ''"them long shots, he never ever got. Why the old mind boggles. But nowadays he pots the lot"'' with Taylor himself singing ''"'cos I wear these goggles"''.

He was also one of the first players to develop a relative competence in using his left hand to play the game, though he himself said this was partly because he hated to play shots with the rest. Taylor's form deteriorated at quite a pace in the 1990s and he dropped out of the top 16 after the [[1994 World Snooker Championship|1994 World Championship]], the last remaining player who had been in the original world rankings in 1976. He retired from playing in 2000 telling the [[BBC]] "I've had enough of this filthy game. I can now concentrate on my passion which is breathing heavily on false teeth. Tee hee".&lt;ref name="WS profile"/&gt;

===Personal life===
Taylor now commentates on the three televised snooker tournaments each year for the [[BBC]] and is known for his bona fide and light-hearted commentary. His most famous commentary incident occurred in 1998 when co-commentator [[Clive Everton]] nearly strangled Taylor after instinctively grabbing his tie as he fell off his chair.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrUYFNHcJEQ YouTube video of the Everton necktie incident with interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Everton wrongly believed one snooker was required by a player before Taylor stated correctly that he actually needed three snookers to get back into the frame. Everton subsequently proclaimed that his "''brains have gone completely''" before leaning back in his chair which then gave way. He reached out as he fell, grabbing Taylor's tie and pulling him down with him. An audible bang rang around the auditorium as Everton fell off his chair and out the commentary box with Taylor laughing uncontrollably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Clive Everton |url=http://www.prosnookerblog.com/media/television/clive-everton/ |work=prosnookerblog.com |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor has also made guest appearances on [[Big Break]], [[They Think It's All Over (TV series)|They Think It's All Over]], [[Russian Roulette (game show)|Russian Roulette]], [[A Question of Sport]], [[The Weakest Link]] and [[The Sooty Show]]. In 2005, he was one of the celebrities taking part in the third series of the successful BBC show [[Strictly Come Dancing]], reaching eighth place with his partner Izabela Hannah.

In February 1990, Taylor officially opened the ''[[Royal Mail]] [[Sorting office|Sorting Office]]'', in [[Blackburn, Lancashire|Blackburn]], Lancashire, giving it his own stamp of approval. He then took part in a one-frame friendly challenge match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/6092996.TEN_YEARS_AGO__Royal_Mail_on_cue/|title=TEN YEARS AGO: Royal Mail on cue|date=February 15, 2000|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor currently lives in [[Llay]] near [[Wrexham]] and has been a resident of the village since April 2003. His son Damien is a professional golf coach. His autobiography is entitled ''Frame By Frame''.

Depending on the [[media (communication)|medium]], the executive producer may be concerned with [[management accounting]] or associated with legal issues (like [[copyright]]s or [[royalties]]).&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Typically an executive producer may handle business and legal issues|url=https://www.imdb.com/glossary/E#executive_producer|accessdate= March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In films, the executive producer generally contributes to the [[Film budgeting|film's budget]] and usually does not work on set, in contrast to most other [[film producer|producer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-an-executive-producer.htm |title=What is an Executive Producer? |website=WiseGEEK |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motion pictures ==
{{main|Film producer}}
In films, executive producers [[film finance|finance]] the film or participate in the creative effort, but do not work on the set. Their responsibilities vary from [[funding]] or attracting investors into the movie project to [[law|legal]], [[screenplay|scripting]], [[marketing]], advisory and supervising capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Executive Producer (aka Executive in Charge of Production)|url=http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/job_roles/3086_executive_producer_aka_executive_in_charge_of_production|accessdate= January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crediting of executive producers in the film industry has risen over time. In the mid-to-late 1990s, there were an average of just under two executive producers per film. In 2000, the number jumped to 2.5 (more than the number of standard "[[film producer|producers]]"). In 2013, there were an average of 4.4 executive producers per film, compared with 3.2 producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many movie producers does a film need?|url=https://stephenfollows.com/how-many-movie-producers-per-film |accessdate= 2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
{{main|Television producer}}
In television, an executive producer usually supervises the creative content and the financial aspects of a production. Some writers, like [[Stephen J. Cannell]], [[Tina Fey]], and [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], have worked as both the creator and the producer of the same TV show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In television, an Executive Producer may also be the Creator/Writer of a series|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?page=faq|accessdate = March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In case of multiple executive producers on a TV show, the one outranking the others is called the [[showrunner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There can be multiple executive producers on a series, but the one in charge is called the showrunner.|url=http://filmtvcareers.about.com/od/basics/p/CP_TV_Writer.htm|accessdate = March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the leading executive producer.

==Music==
{{See also|Music executive}}
In recorded music, [[record label]]s distinguish between an executive producer and a [[record producer]]. The executive producer is responsible for business decisions and more recently, organizing the recordings along with the music producer, whereas the record producer produces the music. Sometimes the executive producer organises the recording and selects recording-related crew, such as [[sound engineer]]s and [[session musician]]s.&lt;ref name="Discovery Channel"&gt;{{cite web|title=The executive producer usually chooses the musicians and technicians for a record, decides where and when to record, and the production budget and timetable|url=http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/what-music-executive-producer-do|accessdate=March 12, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.fo/20130410181827/http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/what-music-executive-producer-do|archivedate=10 April 2013|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Video games ==
{{main|Video game producer}}
In the [[video game industry]], the title "executive producer" is not well-defined. It may refer to an external producer working for the [[video game publisher|publisher]], who works with the [[video game developer|developer]]s. 

For example, in 2012, [[Jay-Z]] was announced as executive producer for [[NBA 2K13]]. His role consisted of appearing in an introduction, picking songs for the game's soundtrack and contributing to the design of its in-game menus "and other visual elements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Argent said Jay-Z's influence would be felt immediately in the game, starting during its video introduction.

'''Gambling in the United Kingdom''' is regulated by the [[Gambling Commission]] on behalf of the government's [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] (DCMS) under the [[Gambling Act 2005]]. This [[Act of Parliament]] significantly updated the [[United Kingdom|UK's]] [[gambling]] laws, including the introduction of a new structure of protections for children and vulnerable adults, as well as bringing the burgeoning [[Internet]] gaming sector within British regulation for the first time.

==Gambling forms==

===Bingo and casinos===
The game of [[Housie]] was popularised in the armed forces in the [[Second World War]] and brought back to Britain after the end.  The [[Betting and Gaming Act 1960]] allowed commercial bingo halls to be set up, provided they were established as members-only clubs and had to get their take from membership fees and charges rather than as a percentage of the entry fees.

[[File:Mecca bingo hall - geograph.org.uk - 1183990.jpg|thumb|A [[Mecca Leisure Group|Mecca]] bingo hall in Birmingham.]]

Casinos had a similar history, with requirement for licensing from the [[Gaming Board of Great Britain]] and for casinos to be [[members only club]]s.  The number of gaming machines in casinos was limited at 10. The Casino Club [[Port Talbot]] in Wales — believed to be Britain's first legal casino — was established in 1961 by gambling mogul [[George Alfred James]]. James opened several casino-cum-cabaret and fine dining establishments in the 1960s, including the Charlie Chester Casino and Golden Horseshoe in London and the Kingsway and Grand Casino in [[Southport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://livecasino.co.uk/category/live-casino-history/ |title=Live Casino History |accessdate=15 October 2015 |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[South Wales Evening Post]] |accessdate=14 March 2014 |title=Story of Port Talbot man who changed the world of gambling has been uncovered |url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Story-Port-Talbot-man-changed-world-gambling/story-19956268-detail/story.html#ixzz2vw9MjNRj |date=18 October 2013 |author-first=G. |author-last=Roberts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gaming Act 1968]] liberalised the law, paving the way for more commercial casinos. The first very popular game was [[Chemin D'affairs|Chemmy]], popularised by the [[Clermont Set|Clermont Club]], in [[London]].

The [[Gambling Act 2005]] paved the way for larger resort style [[casino]]s to be built, albeit in a controlled manner with one being built every few years until the Act is fully implemented. Many towns and cities bid to host one of these so-called "super casinos", which will be similar to those found in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. On 30 January 2007 [[Manchester]] was announced as the winning bid to be the location of the first super casino. On 29 March 2007, the [[House of Lords]] urged the Government to review plans for the massive super casino in Manchester. Instead it supported plans for 16 smaller casinos, including ones in [[Solihull]] and [[Wolverhampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2007/03/29/casino-bid-hit-by-lords-vote-97319-18826226 |work=[[Birmingham Mail]] |title=Casino bid hit by Lords vote |date=29 March 2007 |accessdate=14 March 2014 |last=Walker |first=Jonathon }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, then Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said that the Government would not be proceeding with the super casino in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557170/Gordon-Brown-scraps-super-casinos.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |title=Gordon Brown scraps super-casinos |author1-first=Ben |author1-last=Quinn |author2-first=Graeme |author2-last=Wilson |accessdate=14 March 2014 |date=12 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/jul/12/gambling.immigrationpolicy |date=12 July 2007 |accessdate=14 March 2014 |title=Brown U-turn over plan for supercasino}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaming machines are divided into a number of [[slot machine#United Kingdom|categories]], mainly depending upon the stakes and payouts involved, and whether there is an element of skill (these are known officially as AWPs or "Amusement with Prizes" machines).

===Gambling on sports===
[[File:"Ladbrokes" - geograph.org.uk - 700779.jpg|thumb|A [[Ladbrokes]] betting shop in [[Rawtenstall]], Lancashire.]]
[[Sports betting|Sports gambling]] has a long history in the United Kingdom, having been controlled for many decades, and more recently relaxed.  The 1960 Act legalised off-course bookmakers.  Pool betting on horses is a monopoly of [[The Tote]]. There are over 1,000 betting shops located in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://best-betting-websites.com/bookmakers/london |first=Dzmitry|last=Arlou |date=24 August 2016 |accessdate=24 October 2016 |title=Betting Shops Locator in London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a large market in the United Kingdom for gambling on competitive sports at [[bookmaker]]s (betting shops) or licensed websites, particularly for [[horse racing|horse]], [[greyhound racing]] and [[association football|football]].  The last of these also has an associated form of gambling known as the [[football pools]], in which players win by correctly predicting the outcome of each week's matches.

The online sports betting market in the UK is estimated to be worth £650 million which has seen a compounding annual growth rate from 2009–12 of approximately 7%. The total online gambling population in the UK is estimated at 2.1 million customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.favourit.com/en/content/uk-sports-betting-stats-mobile |first=James |last=Hudson |date=12 January 2014 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |title=UK sports betting market growth &amp; mobile betting |work=Favourit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501195258/http://www.favourit.com/en/content/uk-sports-betting-stats-mobile |archivedate=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports gambling is advertized on television at times when children and young people are watching.  There are calls for the government to control this.  Dr Heather Wardle, a gambling behaviour expert from the [[London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine]], said, “It’s hard to prove what harm is being done because it’s a generational thing and the harm comes much further down the line. We’re creating the conditions that normalise gambling for a generation.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/10/uk-government-should-restrict-gambling-ads-seen-by-children-industry-says State should restrict gambling ads seen by children, industry says] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Stevens of the [[National Health Service|NHS]], expressed disapproval of eight betting firms because they do not pay towards NHS costs in countering gambling addiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/04/bishop-attacks-delay-fixed-odds-betting-cap Bishop warns ministers over delay to £2 fixed-odds betting cap] ''[[The Observer]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lotteries===
A statute of 1698 provided that in England lotteries were by default illegal unless specifically authorised by statute. The aim of the statute was that before the era of mass and efficient communications, those running national lotteries could claim to one part of the country that the winner lived in another, and do the same the other way: thus taking all the stakes and paying nothing out.

A 1934 Act legalised small lotteries, which was further liberalised in 1956 and 1976, but even then severely limited in the stakes, and the geographical scope that they could cover, so there could be no chance of the lottery organisers deceiving the bettors. There could be no big national lottery until the Government established one, however.

Other countrywide lotteries do exist, but work by dividing the prizes and stakes strictly on a geographical basis into small areas and thus technically not becoming a national lottery. The Gambling Commission called the Health Lottery in 2010 "a very fine line" and insisted it would only be legal if split into at least 31 separate, identifiable schemes so as not to become "a ''[[de facto]]'' National Lottery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/90142/response/228239/attach/html/4/Health%20Lottery%20decision%20sheet.pdf.html|title=Decision of the Regulatory Panel Following a Hearing|date=2 September 2010|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====National Lottery====
{{main article|National Lottery (United Kingdom)}}
The United Kingdom's state-franchised [[lottery]] is known as the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], which was set up under government licence in 1993.

Several games are run under this brand, including '''Lotto''' and '''Thunderball'''. As with other lotteries players choose a set of numbers, say 6 from 50, with six numbers then being drawn at random. Players win cash prizes depending on how many numbers they match.

The National Lottery launched a [[Europe|pan-European]] "super-lottery", called [[EuroMillions]], in 2004. Currently this is available in nine countries.

[[File:EuroMillions tickets.jpg|thumb|EuroMillions tickets.]]

In the United Kingdom, the national lottery has so far raised several billions of pounds for [[Big Lottery Fund|Good Causes]], a programme which distributes money via grants. 28% of lottery revenue goes towards the fund, along with all unclaimed prizes. Additionally, 12% goes to the state. The prize fund is 45% of revenue, with the remaining 15% going towards running costs and profits for the lottery organisers and ticket sellers.

The odds of specific combinations occurring in the United Kingdom national lottery are as follows{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}:

====Health Lottery====
{{main article|The Health Lottery}}
In February 2011 the media tycoon [[Richard Desmond]] announced the launch of a new [http://healthlottery.org/ Health Lottery],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthlottery.co.uk/|title=The Health Lottery|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of raising a minimum of £50 million each year for health-related charities. Tickets cost £1 each and 20p in the pound goes to the charities involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthlottery.co.uk/lottery-good-causes|title=The Health Lottery {{!!}} Lottery Good Causes|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Postcode Lottery====
{{main article|UK Postcode Lottery}}
The UK Postcode Lottery is in aid of charity, and works by using an entrant's postcode plus a unique three-digit number as their ticket number. Prizes are drawn every Thursday.

===Scratchcards===
[[Scratchcard]]s are a very popular form of gambling in the United Kingdom, due to their easy availability and cheap price. These are small pieces of card where an area has been covered by a substance that cannot be seen through, but can be scratched off. Under this area are concealed the items/pictures that must be 'found' in order to win.

===Amusement arcades===
The Gambling Commission identifies 3 types of [[amusement arcade]]s
*adult gaming centres (AGCs)
*licensed family entertainment centres (FECs)
*unlicensed FECs.

In 2009/2010 the FECs made up 81% of the arcade sector in gross gambling yield.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/pdf/Gambling%20Industry%20Statistics%202009%202010%20WEB%20-%20January%202011.pdf Gambling Industry statistics 2009/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gambling in other venues===

====Remote gambling====
Until the [[Betting Gaming and Lotteries Act 1960]] off-course betting in person was illegal, but bets by telephone were legal since this was not considered, by the letter of the law, "resorting to a house kept for the purpose of betting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1935|page=333|title=[[Uncommon Law]]|author-first=A. P.|author-last=Herbert|authorlink=A. P. Herbert|chapter=The Postmaster-General vs. Slot. The Bookmaker's Telephone|publisher=Methuen Publishing|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was frequent for "bookie's runners" to take and run bets from a [[Payphone|public telephone]] to the bookmaker himself.

Remote gambling is growing in popularity in the United Kingdom. According to the survey conducted by the Gambling Commission, as of March 2010, 10.7% of the 8,000 adults surveyed said they had participated in at least one form of remote gambling in the previous 4 weeks. In 2009 the figure was 10.5%, in 2008 – 7.2%, in 2007 – 8.8%, in 2006 – 7.2%. The major part of these gamblers was represented by those playing the National Lottery online. Upon their exclusion, the figures are 5.7%, 5.7%, 5.6% and 5.2% respectively.

All forms of online gambling are licensed by the Gambling Commission and therefore can be legally provided in the country under a licence from the Commission. The Commission's site has details of both licensed operators and applicants.

Many bookmakers such as [[888sport]], [[Betfair]], [[Ladbrokes]] and [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] have offshore operations but these are largely for overseas customers since no tax is due on winnings of bets in the UK. Before 2001, a 10% levy was paid on bets at an off-course bookmaker (but none at a racecourse) and this could be paid "before" or "after" i.e. on the stake or the winnings, the proceeds going to the [[Horserace Totalisator Board]]. Many would advise you, as a [[tipster]], to "pay the tax before" since it is a smaller amount, but mathematically it works out the same{{clarify|date=August 2016}} since arithmetical [[multiplication]] is [[commutative]]. This tax was abolished with the general reform of the gambling acts.

====Licensed premises (pubs)====
{{see also|Pub games}}
Until the Gambling Act 2005, the [[Betting Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963]] prohibited "betting and the passing of betting slips" in licensed premises, that is those licensed to sell alcohol. Six specific games, [[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], [[Cribbage]], [[Darts]], [[Bar billiards]], [[Shove-halfpenny]] and [[Dominoes]] could be "played for small stakes on those parts of the premises open to the public". A notice to the effect had to be posted in a prominent place.

It is legal to place bets via mobile phones from a pub, even through the pub's wi-fi connection, but only for oneself, not for another.&lt;ref name="ma"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Morning Advertiser]]|url=http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/Business-Support/Legal-checklist-Betting-activity-in-pubs|accessdate=14 March 2014|title=Legal Checklist: Betting activity in pubs|date=18 June 2013|first=Poppleston|last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also legal for publicans to have pools coupons or other slips available, but not to take the bets themselves.&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt; Passing on a bet on behalf of another, in any capacity, is generally considered by law to be acting as an agent and would require a licence.&lt;ref name="ma"/&gt;

==Syndicates==

[[Betting syndicate]]s, where several bettors pool their bets, may or may not be illegal, depending on the nature of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gambling.answers.com/sports-betting/sports-betting-syndicates |work=answers.com |title=Sports betting syndicates |accessdate=12 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904075140/http://gambling.answers.com/sports-betting/sports-betting-syndicates |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, the person actually laying the bet could be considered an agent, especially if they take a cut of the stake. However, [[lottery syndicate]]s are extremely common and even officially encouraged.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The legal fine point is whether the person collecting the individual stakes and placing the bets is doing so with or without profit (regardless of whether that person is also a member of the syndicate). [[Sweepstake]]s for the [[Grand National]] and occasionally other events are extremely common in offices, and are generally winked at if played for small stakes and not for profit (or that any profit goes to charity).

Publicans must also be vigilant in ensuring that their customers do not pass betting slips between each other but only bet for themselves. In general, it is illegal for the holder of a licence to sell alcohol to facilitate betting on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/pdf/Facilitating%20betting%20in%20pubs%20and%20clubs%20is%20illegal%20-%20February%202008.pdf|work=[[Gambling Commission]]|date=25 August 2010|title=Facilitating betting in pubs is illegal|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most pubs in the UK have a [[one-armed bandit]] of one kind or another, but the prizes are strictly controlled. The law allows larger prizes in [[private club]]s.

==Economy and taxation==
"Betting duty" at 6.75% was applied to sports bets until 2001 when it was replaced by a 15% tax on gross profits.&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2736634/Punters-rally-as-betting-tax-ends.html&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1 December 2014, the Gambling (Licensing &amp; Advertising) Bill&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightcasino.com/news/new-uk-gambling-law-explained/ "New UK gambling law explained: what's all the fuss about?" ''Right Casino''. Retrieved 6 October 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt; will change the taxation of remote gambling from a 'place of supply' basis to a 'point of consumption' basis.&lt;ref&gt;HMRC http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/gamblingtaxreform/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The betting industry alone is reported to contribute £6 billion as of January 2010, 0.5% of [[GDP]]. Furthermore, it employs over 100,000 people and generates £700 Million in tax revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egrmagazine.com/news/428923/deloitte-uk-betting-worth-6bn-100000-jobs.thtml/|title=Deloitte: UK betting worth £6bn, 100,000 jobs - EGR Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Age restrictions==
{{Gambling ages in the United Kingdom}}

==Advertising restrictions==

The [[UK government]] previously limited television ads to only National Lottery, Bingo, and football pools, but when a new Gambling Act came into effect in 2007 they relaxed all of those restrictions. By 2013, the UK media regulator [[Ofcom]] reported that this more relaxed approach had led to a six-fold increase in the number of [[gambling]] ads that were aired on the TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Gambling Firms Spend Half A Billion in TV Adverts|url=http://grizzlygambling.com/news/uk-gambling-spends-half-a-billion-on-TV-adverts.html|website=GrizzlyG|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
''Garshasp: The Monster Slayer'' is a [[third-person (video games)|third-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game, taking place in mythological ancient Persia, in a world occupied by monsters and [[Deev]]s.&lt;ref name="Worthplaying"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worthplaying.com/article/2011/5/2/news/81174/ |title='Garshasp' Announced - Screens |date=2011-05-02 |publisher=Worthplaying |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game focuses mainly on combat with large weapons and heavy combo moves. Platforming and puzzle solving also play a major role in the game play style.

Garshasp has the ability to jump, double jump, and dodge as well as perform light and heavy attacks. These attacks can be executed in certain orders allowing for several different maneuvers which vary in combat strength and character animation. As the game progresses Garshasp can also accumulate further levels of experience which can further unlock new attacks.

The more attacks the player engages in also subsequently raises Garshasp's Rage meter, enabling the player to execute stronger combos. Garshasp can also dispatch weaker enemies through an action resulting in an instant kill, which is useful for dispatching large numbers of enemies. Stronger foes can also be felled in this manner, although they first must be weakened by conventional attacks.

Damage to the player may be healed by various blue orbs mounted on pedestals that are scattered throughout the game environment. There are also red orbs that can grant the player experience boosts. The game offers no external control of the camera view, with the game itself programmed to orient the world based on the current action or event taking place.

The games puzzle solving element mostly consists of the player opening new areas by hitting switches or levers as well as several environmental challenges, including several scenes where Garshasp must use his sword to assist in a controlled descent down a vertical surface, as well as more traditional platformer elements.

== Story ==
[[File:Personnage principal du jeu-vidéo Garshasp.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Promotional art showing the Main Character]]
Years after the confinement of Azhi Dahaka ([[Zahhak]]) by [[Fereydun]] in [[Mount Damavand]], the evil [[Deev]]s who were the commanders in the army of darkness led by Azhi Dahaka rose again in different parts of the ancient lands of Khunirath and rebelled against the humans who were celebrating the victory of the army of light. Each [[Deev]] formed a colony of its own and continued on bringing suffering to the human race.

Hitasp, the Golden Crown, who possessed numerous deadly magical skills, was among these [[Deev]]s and was seeking to build up its empire in the rocky lands of Faranbagh in [[Hara Berezaiti]]. Siavoshgard, the legendary village that had been the home of many [[Pahlavan (disambiguation)|Pahlavan]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2017}} was raided by Hitasp and his followers and in the battle, Garshasp’s brother, Oroxia, was killed while defending his ancestral home.

Garshasp, the monster slayer and a grand son of [[Jamshid]], starts out pursuing revenge for his brother’s blood by a journey towards the Hitasp's stronghold only to find out that something much more important has been taken in the raid of Siavoshgard and Garshasp’s bravery is to play a big role in the destiny of the world...

== Development ==
Development on the game took place over three years originally by a team of [[Iran]]ian developers under the name of Fanafzar Sharif Game Studios. Fanafzar used mainly [[free software]] tools to develop Garshasp, including the [[OGRE 3D|OGRE]] engine, [[OpenAL]] library, [[Boost C++ Libraries]], and [[WxWidgets]].&lt;ref name="LGN-Interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linuxgamingnews.org/2009/09/07/interview-with-amir-from-fanafzar-garshasp-developers/ |first=Maxim |last=Bardin|title=Interview With Amir From Fanafzar – Garshasp Developers |date=2009-09-07|publisher=Linux Gaming News|accessdate=2011-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development on the game was later moved out of Iran, with the game being completed by the [[Texas|Texan]] studio Dead Mage.&lt;ref name="LGN-May-Update"/&gt; The game was unveiled with its new title, ''Garshasp: The Monster Slayer'', in April 2011.&lt;ref name="BigDownload"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2011/04/13/garshasp-the-monster-slayer-revealed/ |first=John |last=Callaham|title=Garshasp: The Monster Slayer revealed |date=2011-04-13 |publisher=Big Download |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was released online for [[Microsoft Windows]] on May 8, 2011 and was made available through the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] and [[GamersGate]] services on May 9, 2011.

''Garshasp: The Monster Slayer'' received a rating of 6.5/10 from ''Default Prime''. While the reviewer praised it as a competent ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' clone, he thought that the game was too easy and had a few rough edges, stating in conclusion that "imitating a great game does not make a great game". He did however note that it "does succeed in raising the bar on what an independent development studio is capable of delivering."&lt;ref name="DPrime"/&gt;  ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave the game a mediocre rating of only 5.0, stating that the game demonstrates "impressive feats for a $19.99 independent release" but also commenting that its "price is attached to a four-hour game that only partially makes good on its potential."&lt;ref name="GameSpot"/&gt; ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'' commented that Dead Mage had "obviously worked hard to get the game to this level" and that they "like the way the game is themed and presented", but also complained that it is "the kind of game that ends up looking weak by comparison to its high-budget peers."&lt;ref name="RPSReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/05/10/thoughts-on-garshasp-the-monster-slayer/ |first=Jim |last=Rossignol |title=Thoughts On Garshasp: The Monster Slayer |date=2011-05-10 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Player Affinity'' gave the game only a 4.0/10 score, defending the low rating by stating that the game is "an excellent first try from an up-and-coming studio, but it also manages to fall short on several key aspects. These problems, unfortunately, mortally handicap what could have been a moderately enjoyable experience."&lt;ref name="PAReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playeraffinity.com/pc-reviews/garshasp-the-monster-slayer-review.html |first=Jonathan |last=Gann |title=Garshasp: The Monster Slayer Review |date=2011-05-12 |publisher=Player Affinity |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''ZTGD'' rated the game with a slightly more optimistic 5.5/10 score, mostly complaining about gameplay and performance bugs, but also noted that Dead Mage were working on a patch to hopefully solve some of these issues.&lt;ref name="ZTGD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ztgd.com/reviews/8856/garshasp-the-monster-slayer/ |first=John |last=Whitehouse |title=Garshasp: The Monster Slayer Review |date=2011-05-18 |publisher=ZTGD |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HalfBeard's HUD'' gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, stating that "Garshasp is a more than adequate representation of character action games and while it may not be anything special if you’re a fan of this genre you’ll get some enjoyment out of it.&lt;ref name="HBHud"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbhud.com/2011/05/16/review-of-garshasp-the-monster-slayer/ |title=Review of Garshasp: The Monster Slayer|date=2011-05-16 |publisher=HalfBeard's HUD |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Digitally Downloaded'' enjoyed the game, but stressed the need for a [[gamepad]] or similar [[video game console|console]] styled controller, saying that it "really deserves to be played on a format that this kind of game was custom built for."&lt;ref name="DDReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2011/05/review-garshasp-monster-slayer-very.html |title=Review: Garshasp: The Monster Slayer; a very unfortunate God of War clone (PC)  |date=2011-05-11 |publisher=Digitally Downloaded |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mobile Computing News'' decided that the game has "lots of potential, but only provides four hours of fun which can be hindered by some annoying glitches."&lt;ref name="MCNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobile-computing-news.co.uk/software/11722/review-of-garshasp-the-monster-slayer.html |title=Review of Garshasp: The Monster Slayer |date=2011-05-19 |publisher=Mobile Computing News |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Houdini''''' is a 1953 American [[Technicolor]] film [[biographical film|biography]] from [[Paramount Pictures]], produced by [[George Pal]] and Berman Swarttz, directed by [[George Marshall (director)|George Marshall]], that stars [[Tony Curtis]] and his then-wife [[Janet Leigh]]. The film's [[screenplay]], based upon the life of magician and escape artist [[Harry Houdini]], is by [[Philip Yordan]], based on the book ''Houdini'' by Harold Kellock. The film's music score was by [[Roy Webb]] and the cinematography by [[Ernest Laszlo]]. The art direction was by [[Albert Nozaki]] and [[Hal Pereira]] and the costume design by [[Edith Head]].
  
The film's storyline is a fictionalized account of Houdini's life. It details his beginnings as a locksmith, up through his international success as a world-renowned escape artist and stage magician. Following the death of his mother, he exposes various fraudulent Mediums in the [[spiritualism|spiritualist movement]], while always hoping to make contact with her. The film also follows his love for his wife [[Bess Houdini]] and his most dangerous stunts and stage illusions.

==Plot==
In the 1890s, young Harry Houdini ([[Tony Curtis]]) is performing with a [[Coney Island]] carnival as Bruto, the Wild Man, when Bess ([[Janet Leigh]]), a naive onlooker, tries to protect him from the blows of Schultz ([[Sig Ruman]]), his "trainer." Harry then appears as magician The Great Houdini and, spotting Bess in the audience, invites her on stage. Harry flirts with the unsuspecting Bess during his act, but she flees from him in a panic. When Bess shows up to watch Harry perform two more times, however, he corners her. Bess admits her attraction, and soon after, the two appear at Harry's mother's house, newly married. Bess becomes Harry's onstage partner, touring the country with him, but soon grows tired of the low pay and grueling schedule.

After Bess convinces Harry to take a job in a [[locksmith]] factory, Harry works as a lock tester while fantasizing about escaping from one of the factory's large safes. On [[Halloween]], Harry and Bess attend a special magicians' dinner at the [[Hotel Astor]], during which magician Fante offers a prize to anyone who can free himself from a [[straitjacket]]. Harry accepts the challenge and, through intense concentration, extricates himself from the jacket, greatly impressing Fante. Afterward, however, Fante advises Harry to "drop it," noting that Johann Von Schweger, a [[Germans|German]] magician, retired at the height of his career after performing a similar feat, fearful of his own talents. Bess then persuades Harry to give her his prize, a single, round-trip boat ticket to [[Europe]], so that she can cash it in for a down payment on a house.

Later, at the factory, Harry locks himself inside one of the big safes, determined to make an escape. Before he can get out, however, the foreman orders the safe blown open, then fires Harry. That night, in front of his mother (Angela Clarke), Harry and Bess argue about their future, and frustrated by Bess's insistence that he quit magic, Harry walks out. Soon, a contrite Bess finds Harry performing with a [[carnival]] and presents him with two one-way tickets to Europe. Sometime later, at a [[London]] theater, Harry and Bess are concluding their magic act when a reporter named Dooley ([[Michael Pate]]) challenges Harry to break out of one of [[Scotland Yard]]'s notoriously secure jail cells. Harry, who hired Dooley to issue the challenge, accepts the challenge, unaware that the jail's cells do not have locks in the door, but on the outside wall. Despite the added difficulty, the dexterous, determined Houdini picks the cell lock and appears on time for his next performance. Now billed as the "man who escaped from Scotland Yard," Harry begins a successful tour of Europe with Bess.

In [[Berlin]], Harry is joined by his mother and begins searching for the reclusive Von Schweger. While performing an impromptu levitation trick with Bess at a restaurant, Harry is arrested for [[fraud]]. During his trial, Harry denies that he ever made claims to [[supernatural powers]], insisting that all his tricks are accomplished through physical means. To prove his point, Harry locks himself in a safe in the courtroom and breaks out a few minutes later, noting that safe locks are designed to keep thieves out, not in. Vindicated, Harry then goes to see Von Schweger, who finally has responded to his queries, but learns from Von Schweger's assistant, Otto ([[Torin Thatcher]]), that the magician died two days earlier. Otto reveals that Von Schweger summoned Harry to ask him the secret of "dematerialization," a feat he accomplished once but could not repeat. Although Harry demurs, Otto insists on becoming Harry's new assistant and travels with him to [[New York City]].

There, Harry finds he is virtually unknown, so for publicity, hangs upside down on a skyscraper flagpole, constrained by a straitjacket. Harry executes the escape and soon makes a name for himself in [[United States|America]]. To prepare to be submerged in a box in the chilly [[Detroit River]], Harry bathes in an ice-filled bathtub. During the trick, which takes place on Halloween, the chain holding the box breaks, and the box drops upside down into an opening in the ice-covered river. Although Harry manages to escape from the box, the current drags him downstream, and he struggles to find air pockets under the ice and swim back to the opening. Above, Bess and the horrified audience assume Harry has drowned and proclaim his demise. To Bess's relief, Harry shows up later at their hotel, saying that he heard his mother's voice, directing him toward the opening. Just then, Harry receives word that his mother died at the exact time that he heard her voice.

Two years later in New York, Harry, who has not performed since his mother's death, reveals to Simms ([[Douglas Spencer]]), a reporter, that he has been trying to contact his mother's spirit, without success. Harry invites Simms to attend a seance with him, and after the medium appears to have communicated with his mother, Harry and Otto expose her as a fake. After a public crusade against phony mediums, Harry decides to return to the stage and builds a watery torture cell for the occasion. Terrified, Bess threatens to leave Harry unless he drops the dangerous trick, and he agrees not to perform it. Before the show, Harry admits to Otto that his appendix is tender, but goes on, despite the pain. When the audience noisily demands that he perform the advertised "water torture" trick, Harry succumbs and is immersed, upside down, in a tank of water. Weak, Harry cannot execute the escape and loses consciousness. Otto breaks the tank's glass, and after reviving, the now-dying Harry vows to a weeping Bess that he will come back.

{{nihongo|'''''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'''''|ジョジョの奇妙な冒険|JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken|lead=yes}} is an [[original video animation]] adaptation of [[Hirohiko Araki]]'s [[manga]] series of the same name, ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]''. Produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] (Another Push Pin Planning), it was adapted from the series' third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''.

The first six episodes were originally released  by [[Pony Canyon]] on [[VHS]] and [[Laserdisc]] from 1993 to 1994, adapting the latter half of the story arc. This set of episodes begins with Jotaro Kujo and his companions in the middle of their quest to find [[Dio Brando]], offering very little exposition to the back-story that led to the present events of the OVA.

The second series, consisting of seven episodes, were released by Klock Worx on [[DVD]] and VHS from 2000 to 2002, featuring most of the same cast, but produced with different directors and writers. These additional episodes, titled "Adventure 1" through "7", served as a [[prequel]] to the earlier-produced episodes, adapting the beginning of the story arc that featured the circumstances that led to Jotaro's quest. The earlier episodes were subsequently re-released as part of this series, but renumbered as "Adventure 8" through "13" to take into account their later chronological placement. A DVD box set featuring all 13 episodes was released on May 25, 2007, which included a soundtrack CD and a set of 31 [[tarot]] cards illustrated by Hirohiko Araki.

The series was released in North America by Super Techno Arts. It was released on six DVD volumes 2003 to 2005, dubbed in English, with all 13 episodes also featured in chronological order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-04-27/sakura-con-super-techno-arts-panel "Sakura Con - Super Techno Arts Panel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723113126/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2002-04-27/sakura-con-super-techno-arts-panel |date=2011-07-23 }} Retrieved on 2011-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, distribution for the ''Jojo's Bizarre Adventure'' OVA series was indefinitely suspended following the controversy over the presence of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] in Episode 6.&lt;ref name="1000manga"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sales/&gt; The same story arc would later be adapted for the later ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'' TV series in its second season, which aired from 2014 to 2015.

==Controversy==
In May 2008, both studio A.P.P.P. and Shueisha halted OVA/manga shipments of ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' after a complaint had been launched against them from [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] [[Islamic fundamentalism|Islamic fundamentalists]], after noticing a scene in the OVAs that has the villain, Dio Brando, reading a book depicting pages from the [[Quran|Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="1000manga"&gt;{{cite web |title=Jason Thompson's House of 1000 Manga - Jojo's Bizarre Adventure |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2010-12-23 |work=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422183157/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/house-of-1000-manga/2010-12-23 |archivedate=2012-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sales&gt;{{cite web |title=Jojo's Anime, Manga Sales Halted Due to Islamic Images |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-22/jojo-anime-manga-sales-halted-due-to-islamic-images |work=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524170858/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2008-05-22/jojo-anime-manga-sales-halted-due-to-islamic-images |archivedate=2008-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This recall affected the English-language release of the manga as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of, and destroying, [[mosque]]s.&lt;ref name="1000manga"/&gt; Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009.

The '''Legion of Super-Heroes''' is a fictional [[superhero]] team appearing in American comic books published by [[DC Comics]]. Created by writer [[Otto Binder]] and artist [[Al Plastino]], the Legion is a group of superpowered beings living in the 30th and 31st centuries of the {{DC Universe}}, and first appears in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #247 (April 1958).

Initially, the team was closely associated with the original [[Superboy (Kal-El)|Superboy]] character ([[Superman]] when he was a teenager), and was portrayed as a group of [[time travel]]ers. Later, the Legion's origin and back story were fleshed out, and the group was given its own monthly comic. Eventually, Superboy was removed  from the team altogether and appeared only as an occasional guest star.

The team has undergone two major [[reboot (fiction)|reboots]] during its run. The [[Legion of Super-Heroes (1958 team)|original version]] was replaced with a [[Legion of Super-Heroes (1994 team)|new rebooted version]] following the events of the "[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]" storyline in 1994 and [[Legion of Super-Heroes (2004 team)|another rebooted team]] was introduced in 2004. A [[Legion of Super-Heroes (1958 team)#Post-Infinite Crisis (2007–2015)|fourth version of the team]], nearly identical to the original version, was introduced in 2007.

After a series of tests, Superboy was awarded membership and returned to his own time.

Although intended as a one-off story focusing on Superboy, the Legion proved so popular that it returned for an encore in ''Adventure Comics'' #267 (December 1959). In this story, Lightning Boy had been renamed [[Lightning Lad]], and their costumes were very close to those they wore throughout the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]]. The Legion's popularity grew, and they appeared in further stories in ''Adventure Comics'', ''[[Action Comics]]'', and other titles edited by [[Mort Weisinger]] over the next few years.&lt;ref name="Weisinger-GCD"&gt;{{gcdb|type=editor|search= Mort+Weisinger|title= Mort Weisinger (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ranks of the Legion, only hinted at in those first two stories, was filled with new heroes such as [[Chameleon Boy]], [[Invisible Kid]], [[Colossal Boy]], [[Star Boy]], [[Brainiac 5]], [[Luornu Durgo|Triplicate Girl]], [[Shrinking Violet (comics)|Shrinking Violet]], [[Sun Boy]], [[Bouncing Boy]], [[Phantom Girl]], and [[Ultra Boy]]. Even the 20th-century cousin to Superman, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], was recruited as a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| Writer = [[Jerry Siegel|Siegel, Jerry]]| Penciller = [[Jim Mooney|Mooney, Jim]]| Inker = Mooney, Jim| Story = Supergirl's Three Super Girl-Friends!| Title = Action Comics | Issue = 276 | date = May 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Adventure Comics'' #300 (September 1962), the Legion received their own regular feature, cover-billed "Superboy in 'Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Siegel, Jerry| penciller= [[John Forte|Forte, John]]| inker= Forte, John| story= The Face Behind the Lead Mask!| title= Adventure Comics| issue= 300| date= September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they would share space with Superboy solo stories for a couple of years, they eventually displaced Superboy from the title entirely as their popularity grew. Lightning Lad was killed in ''Adventure Comics'' #304 (January 1963) and revived in issue #312 (September 1963).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie, Michael "1960s" in Dolan, p. 108: "The demise of the Legion co-founder was a first not only for the Legion fan base, but for mainstream comics in general...Lightning Lad was resurrected later that year in ''Adventure Comics'' #312."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the ''Adventure Comics'' run which established the Legion's general workings and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Kingman|first = Jim|title = Move Over, Superboy!

The position of Legion leader rotated among the membership. Each Legionnaire had to possess one natural superpower which no other member possessed; despite this, several members had overlapping powers, particularly Superboy, Supergirl, [[Lar Gand|Mon-El]], and Ultra Boy. Some issues included comical moments where candidates with bizarre, useless, or dangerous abilities would try out for membership and be rejected; five of these flawed candidates went on to form the [[Legion of Substitute Heroes]]. The Legion was based on Earth and protected an organization of humans and aliens called the [[United Planets]] alongside the regular police the [[Science Police]]. The setting for each story was 1000 years from the date of publication.

In ''Adventure Comics'' #346 (July 1966), [[Jim Shooter]], 14 years old at the time, wrote his first Legion story.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 118: "In his first-ever published story, fourteen-year-old Jim Shooter admitted four new members into the Legion of Super-Heroes ... Shooter's long, memorable tenure as one of the Legion's greatest writers was officially underway."&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, Shooter became the regular writer of the Legion stories, with Curt Swan, and later [[Win Mortimer]], as artist. Shooter wrote the story in which [[Ferro Lad]] died—the first "real" death of a Legionnaire (although Lightning Lad had been believed dead for a while before)—and introduced many other enduring concepts, including the [[Fatal Five]],&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1960s" in Dolan, p. 123: "Writer Jim Shooter and artist Curt Swan unleashed an even greater menace when the Fatal Five decided to stay united in the years ahead."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]], [[Princess Projectra]], [[Shadow Lass]], the [[Dark Circle]], [[Mordru]] and the "Adult Legion", a conjecture regarding what the Legionnaires would be like when they grew up.

The Legion's last appearance in ''Adventure Comics'' was #380 (May 1969),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Jim Shooter|Shooter, Jim]]| penciller= [[Win Mortimer|Mortimer, Win]]| inker= [[Jack Abel|Abel, Jack]]| story= The Legion's Space Odyssey| title= Adventure Comics| issue= 380| date= May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were displaced by Supergirl in the next issue. The early 1970s saw the Legion relegated to the status of back-up feature. First, the team's stories were moved to ''Action Comics'' for issues #377–392 (June 1969&amp;nbsp;– September 1970).&lt;ref name="Weisinger-GCD" /&gt; Following Mort Weisinger's retirement from DC, the Legion was passed to the oversight of editor [[Murray Boltinoff]] and began appearing occasionally as a backup in ''Superboy'', starting with #172 (March 1971),&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb|type=editor|search= Murray+Boltinoff|title= Murray Boltinoff (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt; with writers [[E. Nelson Bridwell]] and [[Cary Bates]] and artist [[George Tuska]]. [[Dave Cockrum]] began drawing the series with ''Superboy'' #184 (April 1972), again increasing the team's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 151: "After more than a year as Murphy Anderson's background inker, Dave Cockrum landed his big DC break as the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' artist ... Cockrum's debut story, which was written by Cary Bates, quickly established an exciting new vibe for the super-team."&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Superboy'' and their own title====

The first comic book published under the title ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' was a four-issue series published in 1973 that reprinted Legion tales from ''Adventure Comics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingman|first=Jim|title=Reprint Madness: DC's Short-Lived Reprint Line of 1972–1973|journal=Back Issue!|issue=81|pages=47–52|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|date=July 2015|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 2099|title=Legion of Super-Heroes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Legion returned to cover billing on a book when ''Superboy'' became ''Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes'' with #197 (August 1973). Crafted by Bates and Cockrum, the feature proved popular and saw such events as the wedding of Bouncing Boy and [[Luornu Durgo|Duo Damsel]] in ''Superboy'' #200 (Feb 1974).&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 159: "Bouncing Boy and Duo Damsel became the first Legionnaires to tie the knot. The wedding planners were writer Cary Bates and artist Dave Cockrum."&lt;/ref&gt; Issues #202 (June 1974) and #205 (Dec. 1974) of the series were in the [[DC 100 Page Super Spectacular|100 Page Super Spectacular]] format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eury|first=Michael|authorlink= Michael Eury|title=A Look at DC's Super Specs|journal=Back Issue!|issue=81|page=27|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|date=July 2015|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cockrum was replaced on art by [[Mike Grell]] as of issue #203 (August 1974) which featured the death of Invisible Kid.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 160: "With the unenviable task of replacing the departing Dave Cockrum, one of the most popular artists ever to draw the Legion of Super-Heroes, Mike Grell's first issue on ''Superboy starring the Legion of Super-Heroes'' killed off one of the team's most beloved members."&lt;/ref&gt; With #231 (September 1977), the book's title officially changed to ''Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' and also became a "giant-size" title. At this point, the book was written by longtime fan [[Paul Levitz]] and drawn by [[James Sherman (comics)|James Sherman]], although [[Gerry Conway]] frequently wrote as well. Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were married in ''[[Limited Collectors' Edition|All-New Collectors' Edition]]'' #C-55 (1978), a treasury-sized special written by Levitz and drawn by Grell.&lt;ref&gt;McAvennie "1970s" in Dolan, p. 177: "Only an oversized treasury edition could have contained Superboy and the entire Legion of Super-Heroes' battle with the Time Trapper...and the long-awaited wedding of Lightning Lad and Saturn Girl...Legion favorites Paul Levitz and Mike Grell were up to the enormous challenge with the popular tale 'The Millennium Massacre'."&lt;/ref&gt; In #241–245 (July–December 1978) Levitz and Sherman (and then [[Joe Staton]]) produced what was at that time the most ambitious Legion storyline: "[[Earthwar]]", a galactic war between the United Planets and the Khunds, with several other villains lurking in the background. During this period, Karate Kid was [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into his own 20th century-based self-titled series, which lasted 15 issues. Levitz left the book, to be replaced full-time by Gerry Conway.

Superboy departed from the Legion due to a villain's plot, and the book was renamed simply ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' starting with issue #259 (January 1980). Editor [[Jack C. Harris]] hired [[Steve Ditko]] as guest artist on several issues, a decision which garnered a mixed reaction from the title's readership.&lt;ref name="PartTwo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/harris2.shtml |title=Jack C.

====Paul Levitz era====
Paul Levitz returned to write the series with #284. [[Pat Broderick]] and [[Bruce Patterson (comics)|Bruce Patterson]] illustrated the title for a short time before [[Keith Giffen]] began on pencils, with Patterson, and then Larry Mahlstedt, on inks. The creative team received enhanced popularity following "[[The Great Darkness Saga]]",&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K. "1980s" in Dolan, p. 198: "When [Levitz] wrote "The Great Darkness Saga", a five-issue epic that pitted the Legion against one of the most notorious villains of DC's long history, he and artist Keith Giffen crafted the most famous Legion story of all time and became fast fan favorites."&lt;/ref&gt; which ran from #287; #290–294; and ''Annual'' #3, featuring a full assault on the United Planets by [[Darkseid]]. Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] observed that "Working with artist Keith Giffen, Levitz completed the transformation of ''Legion'' into a science-fiction saga of considerable scope and depth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Daniels|first=Les|authorlink=Les Daniels|title=DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|chapter=The Legion of Super-Heroes Teenagers from Outer Space|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Bulfinch Press]]|year=1995|location= New York, New York|page=123|isbn=0821220764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion celebrated issue #300 (June 1983) by revisiting the "Adult Legion" storyline through a series of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] short stories illustrated by a number of popular Legion artists from previous years. The story served to free up Legion continuity from following the "Adult Legion" edict of previous issues.

Giffen's style changed abruptly a few issues later, to a darker and sketchier style inspired by Argentinian artist [[José Antonio Muñoz|José Muñoz]]. A new ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' comic (the third publication under the title) was launched in August 1984. It used a new "deluxe" printing format utilizing Baxter paper instead of the cheaper newsprint that classic comics had always been printed on. The existing Legion series, still on newsprint, and renamed ''Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes'' with issue #314, continued running new material for a year, then began reprinting stories from the new ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' with issue #326. ''Tales'' continued publishing reprints until its final issue, #354 (December 1987).

The new series was launched in August 1984,&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 208: "As DC began to toy with the idea of relaunching some of their more popular titles using high-quality Baxter paper, the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' was an obvious choice. Utilizing the talents of writer Paul Levitz and artist Keith Giffen...the Legion was off and running in their own new title with a major new storyline...the Legion's other monthly comic changed its moniker to ''Tales of the Legion of Super-Heroes'' with issue #314."&lt;/ref&gt; with a five-part story featuring the [[Legion of Super-Villains]]. Giffen left in the middle of the story and was replaced by [[Steve Lightle]], who stayed on the book for a year. The debut story arc saw the death of Karate Kid in issue #4 (November 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 209: "In a story written by Paul Levitz, with art by Keith Giffen and Steve Lightle...the Karate Kid gave his life heroically while battling Nemesis Kid."&lt;/ref&gt; Levitz and Lightle co-created two Legionnaires, [[Tellus (comics)|Tellus]] and [[Quislet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=1667 |title=Because You Demanded It, A Legionnaire Returns: Steve Lightle Talks ''Legion'' |first=Arune |last=Signh |date=October 30, 2002 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66Z21wVts?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=1667 |archivedate=March 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 30, 2012 |quote=I hold the distinction of having suggested the first non-humanoid Legionnaires in the long history of the Legion of Super-Heroes.

[[Greg LaRocque]] began a lengthy run in #16 (November 1985), including a [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s [[The Man of Steel (comic book)|recently rebooted]] [[Superman (vol. 2)|Superman titles]] in #37 and #38. The crossover was the first of several attempts by DC editors to explain the origins and fate of Superboy and his history with the Legion, in light of the revisions to the [[DC Universe]] caused by ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' that removed Superman's career as Superboy from his personal history. In the crossover, [[Pocket Superboy|the Legion's Superboy]] was revealed to have come from a parallel "pocket universe" created by the Time Trapper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]| penciller= Byrne, John| inker= Byrne, John; [[Keith Williams (comics)|Williams, Keith]]| story= Past Imperfect| title= Action Comics| issue= 591 | date= August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crossover ended with Superboy's death. Levitz's run ended with the return of Giffen and a four-part story "The Magic Wars", concluding in #63 (August 1989).

===="Five Years Later"====
[[Image:Legion of Super-Heroes (Post-Crisis version).jpg|thumb|The Legion "five years later" by [[Keith Giffen]] and [[Al Gordon]]]]
Giffen took over plotting as well as penciling with the ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' volume 4 title which started in November 1989, with scripts by [[Tom Bierbaum|Tom]] and [[Mary Bierbaum]] and assists by [[Al Gordon]].&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 241: "Plotted by Keith Giffen and inker Al Gordon, scripted by Tom and Mary Bierbaum, and pencilled by Giffen, this relaunch of the formerly teen team of heroes and heroines broke new ground in the fictional realm of the 30th Century.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id= 3810|title= Legion of Super-Heroes ''vol. 4'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the Magic Wars, the United Planets is a darker place and the Legion a distant memory. However, a group of former Legionnaires worked to re-form the Legion in this harsh new universe, in which Earth was ruled by the alien [[Dominators (DC Comics)|Dominators]].

Shortly after this storyline began, the decision was made to retroactively remove Superboy completely from Legion history. Writer [[Mark Waid]] stated that "Because of inter-office politics and machinations...it was decided that there was no Superboy, but we weren't even allowed to reference him at ''all''." This left the question of where the Legion's inspiration came from without the influence of Superboy. The writers' solution was a massive [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]], in which Mon-El served in the role of paragon instead of Superboy, with several more retcons to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Ford|first = Jim|title = Too Much Time on My Hands: The History of the Time Trapper|journal = Back Issue!|issue = 68|page= 68|publisher = TwoMorrows Publishing|date = October 2013|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issue #5 featured an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] story in which the restructuring took place, and the Time Trapper was replaced in continuity by his onetime underling [[Glorith]].

One major storyline during this period was the discovery of [[The Terra Mosaic|Batch SW6]]''',''' a group of clones of the early Legion (from their ''Adventure Comics'' days), created by the Dominators. Giffen's original conclusion for the storyline was that the clones would eventually have been revealed to be the real Legion, and the ones whose adventures had been chronicled since the 1950s were actually the clones. The adult Legion's secret programming would kick in, forcing them to fight the younger Legion and leading to a fight to the death in which Legionnaires on both teams would die, with the victims’ names being picked at random. Afterwards, the older team would explore the Vega System as a 30th-century version of the [[Omega Men]] in a new series while the younger team would act as the main Legion on Earth. Giffen's other conclusion was for several of the younger and older Legionnaires to die while liberating Earth from the Dominion. The older Legion would defend Earth while the younger Legion would act as the last line of defense for the United Planets as the Omega Men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-60/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #60 |first=Brian |last=Cronin |date=July 20, 2006 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gA9LmvR?url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/07/20/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-60/ |archivedate=August  5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, a parallel title, ''Legionnaires,'' was launched, starring the "SW6" Legion, whose origins were not resolved until the ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' crossover by a different writing team. ''Legionnaires'' was lighter in tone than the main Legion book, and was written by the Bierbaums and drawn by [[Chris Sprouse]]. Giffen left the book after a storyline which involved the destruction of Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Keith Giffen|Giffen, Keith]]; [[Tom and Mary Bierbaum|Bierbaum, Tom; Bierbaum, Mary]]; [[Jason Pearson|Pearson, Jason]]| penciller= Giffen, Keith; Pearson, Jason| inker= [[Karl Story|Story, Karl]]| story= Requiem| title= Legion of Super-Heroes| volume= 4| issue= 38| date= Late December 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 255: "Writer/artist Keith Giffen was leaving the ''Legion'' title, and he was determined to go out with a bang."&lt;/ref&gt; and the Bierbaums continued writing, overseeing the return of several classic characters. When the Bierbaums left, writer Tom McCraw took over and made a number of changes, such as forcing several Legion members underground, which required them to take on new identities and costumes, and bringing back long-absent Legionnaire [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 1994, DC [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] the team's continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Roach|first1= David A.|authorlink1= David Roach (comics)|last2= Misiroglu|first2= Gina Renee|chapter= Legion of Super-Heroes|title= The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroes|publisher= [[Omnigraphics]]|year= 2005|location= Detroit, Michigan|pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BlKKx5aOSukC&amp;pg=PT678&amp;dq=Legion+of+Super-Heroes+hopelessly+confused+Housecleaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR-K2i2LnJAhWKMyYKHfZjAMIQ6AEIMDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Legion%20of%20Super-Heroes%20hopelessly%20confused%20Housecleaning&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0780807723|quote= ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' continued to build upon decades of already cluttered continuity, and readers—as well as editors and writers—were hopelessly confused.

The "Five Years Later" era of the Legion has never been reprinted by DC Comics.

===Rebooted (1994–2004)===

Following ''Zero Hour'', a new Legion continuity was created, beginning with a retelling of the origin story starting in ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 4) #0 and then continued in spin-off sister series ''Legionnaires'' #0 (both released in October 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Dolan, p. 267: "The previously uninterrupted adventures of the team from the 30th Century had ended in the chaos of ''Zero Hour''. But in this zero issue written by Tom McCraw and Mark Waid and drawn by Stuart Immonen, a new incarnation's adventures were only just beginning."&lt;/ref&gt; Lightning Lad was renamed [[Live Wire (DC Comics)|Live Wire]], and after the group's founding, a large number of heroes were added to the roster very quickly. Several members from the previous continuity were given new codenames, and some new heroes were added, including [[XS (comics)|XS]] (the granddaughter of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen, the second Flash]]), [[Kinetix]], and [[Gates (comics)|Gates]].

While in some ways following the pattern of the original continuity, the new continuity diverged from the old one in several ways: some characters died as they had previously, others did not{{Clarify|reason=Did not die at all or did not die in the previous manner?|date=February 2017}}, and some Legion members spent time in the 20th century where they recruited [[Ferro (comics)|Ferro]]. The Legion also started out having to earn the respect of the United Planets, which they did through two well-earned victories: successfully defending Earth from the White Triangle Daxamites, a group of Nazi-style racial purists; and exposing United Planets President Chu as the mastermind behind the Braal-Titan War, the Sun Eater hoax, the formation of the Fatal Five and the brainwashing of future Legionnaire [[Element Lad|Jan Arrah]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Wallace|first= Dan|contribution= Fatal Five|editor-last= Dougall|editor-first= Alastair|title= The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page= 119|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|location= London, United Kingdom|year= 2008|isbn= 0-7566-4119-5|oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New writers [[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]] came on board with penciller [[Olivier Coipel]] to produce a dark story leading to the near-collapse of the United Planets and the Legion. In the wake of the disaster, a group of Legionnaires disappeared through a spatial rift and the two existing Legion series came to an end. The [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] ''[[Legion Lost]]'' (2000–2001) chronicled the difficult journey of these Legionnaires to return home, while the ensuing miniseries ''Legion Worlds'' (2001) showed what was happening back in the United Planets during their absence.

A new series, ''The Legion'', was launched in which the Legion was reunited and given a new base and purpose. Written for its first 33 issues by Abnett and Lanning, the series was cancelled with issue 38. The most notable addition to the team during the title's publication was the Post-''Crisis'' Superboy, a 21st-century clone of [[Superman]] and [[Lex Luthor]], who had previously been granted honorary membership.

Following a crossover with the [[Teen Titans]] in ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #16 and the ''Teen Titans/Legion Special'', a new ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' series was launched, written by Mark Waid (who had previously rebooted the title following the events of ''Zero Hour'') and penciled by [[Barry Kitson]].&lt;ref&gt;Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 318: "Top writer Mark Waid and artist Barry Kitson joined forces to relaunch one of DC's best-loved teams."&lt;/ref&gt; This new series recreated the team from the beginning and used the Boy/Lad/Girl/Lass/Kid codenames, which the previous continuities had moved away from using.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Initial issues of this series reintroduced the characters, and provided new and divergent origins for them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} Most characters resemble their previous counterparts in costume and powers, with the most notable exceptions including Chameleon Boy, now called simply Chameleon and depicted as an [[androgynous]] creature; Star Boy, who in this version of the Legion is black; Colossal Boy, who is now a giant who shrinks to human size; and Phantom Girl, who exists in two universes at once and has conversations with people in her own dimension while talking to Legionnaires at the same time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The future universe of this Legion is an emotionally and mentally repressive society which involves human sexuality and contact being kept at arms' length{{clarify|reason=what does "human sexuality" and "kept at arms' length" mean in this context?|date=February 2017}} as well as [[Orwellian]] surveillance of minors. The Legion's main goal is social reform as well as protecting people and inspiring them with the legends of superheroes of old, even though the team isn't appreciated by government authorities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

The Legion is worshiped by thousands of young people on different worlds, collectively known as the "Legionnaires", who follow the group in a [[cult]]-like manner. The Legionnaires based on Earth keep a constant vigil outside Legion headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Beginning with issue #16, ''The Legion of Super-Heroes'' (vol. 5) was retitled ''Supergirl and the Legion of Super-Heroes'' with [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] traveling to the future and joining the Legion. With issue #31, [[Tony Bedard]] replaced Waid as writer. The title reverted to ''The Legion of Super-Heroes'' with issue #37 and Jim Shooter became the writer. The series ended with issue #50, in which the script was credited to "Justin Thyme", a pseudonym previously used by uncredited comic book artists.&lt;ref name="cbul159"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-159/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #159 |first=Brian |last=Cronin |date=June 12, 2008 |publisher=Comic Book Resources |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gAlCFtn?url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2008/06/12/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-159/ |archivedate=August  5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[The Lightning Saga|Lightning Saga]]" crossover in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) #8–10 and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 3) #5–6 featured the return of the original versions of Star Boy (now called Starman), [[Nura Nal|Dream Girl]], Wildfire, Karate Kid, [[Timber Wolf (comics)|Timber Wolf]], [[Princess Projectra|Sensor Girl]], [[Dawnstar]], and Brainiac 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Meltzer|first1 = Brad|authorlink1 = Brad Meltzer|last2 = Johns|first2 = Geoff|authorlink2 = Geoff Johns|title = Justice League of America Vol. 2: The Lightning Saga|publisher = DC Comics|year = 2008|page = 224| url = | isbn = 1401216528}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though several differences between the original and ''Lightning Saga'' Legions exist, [[Geoff Johns]] stated that this incarnation of the Legion shares the same history as the original Legion up to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan |last=Phillips |url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/828/828574p1.html |title=Superman/Green Lantern Interview |publisher=IGN |date=October 19, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gBLotjr?url=http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/828/828574p1.html |archivedate=August  5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Clark Kent]] having joined the team as the teenage Superboy prior to the start of his career as Superman.&lt;ref name="jsa5"&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff| penciller= [[Fernando Pasarin|Pasarin, Fernando]]| inker= Pasarin, Fernando| story= The Lightning Saga, Chapter Two: Dreams and Fire| title= [[Justice Society of America]]| volume= 3| issue= 5| date= June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="adv1"&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff| penciller= [[Clayton Henry|Henry, Clayton]]|inker= Henry, Clayton|story= Long Live the Legion, Part One|title= Adventure Comics|volume= 3|issue= 1|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of the Legion next appeared in the "[[Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes]]" storyline in ''Action Comics'' #858–863. In the year 3008, the Earth's sun has turned red and several failed Legion applicants who were born on Earth have banded together to form the Justice League of Earth under the leadership of [[Kirt Niedrigh|Earth-Man]] after he claims that Superman was a human who gained his powers from "Mother Earth". Earth-Man uses the claim to have Earth secede from the United Planets and ban all aliens from Earth, resulting in several Legionnaires going underground. With the help of Superman, the Legion eventually restores the sun to its normal state, and defeats Earth-Man and the Justice League of Earth just as the United Planets is about to attack the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Johns|first = Geoff|author2=Frank, Gary |authorlink2=Gary Frank |title = Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes |publisher = DC Comics|year = 2008|page = 168| url = | isbn = 1401218199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of the Legion next appeared in the 2008 ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]'' limited series, written by Johns and drawn by [[George Pérez]].

====The New 52 (2011–2015)====
''Legion of Super-Heroes'' was relaunched in September 2011 with issue #1. Simultaneously, [[DC Comics]] cancelled ''Adventure Comics'' and replaced it with a new volume of ''Legion Lost''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2011/06/08/the-next-generation-of-justice |title=The Next Generation of Justice |first=David |last=Hyde |date=June 8, 2011 |publisher=DC Comics |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69bivC3tw?url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2011/06/08/the-next-generation-of-justice |archivedate=August  2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |quote= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Legion of Super-Heroes'' continued the adventures of the team from that title's previous volume, ''Legion Lost'' featured [[Wildfire (comics)|Wildfire]], Dawnstar, Timber Wolf, [[Tyroc]], Tellus, Gates and [[Yera Allon|Chameleon Girl]]. The Legion Lost characters are stranded on 21st century Earth during a mission to save the future, and they are forced to remain there after contracting a pathogen that could destroy the 31st century if they returned. The ''Legion Lost'' series ended with the time-lost Legionnaires still stranded in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Tom DeFalco|DeFalco, Tom]]|penciller= Guinaldo, Andres|inker= Irwin, Mark|story= Last Stand!|title= Legion Lost|volume= 2|issue= 16|date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newsarama.com/10368-the-new-48-dc-cancels-4-in-january-2013.html|title= The New 48?

Three members of the Legion of Super-Villains, [[Lightning Lord]], [[Cosmic King]] and [[Saturn Queen]], go back in time to change the course of history. They are later joined by Beauty Blaze and Echo. In the alternate timeline, they use members of the Legion of Super-Heroes who were either brainwashed or converted to their cause as a way to protect their time bubble. Most of the members of this army are based on the original Legion from the 1970s. The only three who were not among this army were Cosmic Boy, Lightning Lad, and Saturn Girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Loeb|first = Jeph|authorlink = Jeph Loeb|author2=Pacheco, Carlos |authorlink2=Carlos Pacheco |title = Superman/Batman Vol. 3: Absolute Power|publisher = DC Comics|year = 2005|page = 128| url = | isbn = 1401204473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billed in-universe as "teenagers from the future," Superduper includes several superheroes whose powers mimic those of the Legion of Super-Heroes, but who are incompetent: Black Hole (a Matter-Eater Lad analog) chokes on a spoon while trying to eat an entire tub of ice cream; Klanker (Ferro Lad) whose attempts to take on his form of iron usually result in him transforming into inanimate objects; and Stool Shadow (Shadow Lass/Phantom Girl), who bumps into walls when trying to phase through them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= [[Garth Ennis|Ennis, Garth]]|penciller= [[Darick Robertson|Robertson, Darick]]|inker= Robertson, Darick|story= The Innocents|title= [[The Boys (comics)|The Boys]]|issue= 40–43|date= March – June 2010|publisher=[[Dynamite Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Legion of Super Heroes (TV series)|Legion of Super Heroes animated series]] premiered on [[Kids' WB!]] (the Saturday Morning kids' block on [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] network) in September 2006. The show's premise is that the Legion travels back in time to recruit Superman in their fight against crime in the 31st century, but they go a little too far back and recruit Superman before he has had a chance to fully develop his powers. Superman, the inspiration for the Legion, now has to learn from them how to be a hero. Season 1 focused on a "core" team consisting of Bouncing Boy, Brainiac 5, Lightning Lad, Phantom Girl, Saturn Girl, Superman, and Timber Wolf, while other Legionnaires such as Cosmic Boy, Colossal Boy, Ferro Lad, Matter-Eater Lad, and Triplicate Girl appeared occasionally. Classic Legion villains such as the Fatal Five, Starfinger, and the Sun-Eater were included, and other Legionnaires, including Blok, Dream Girl, [[Element Lad]], Shrinking Violet, Star Boy, Sun Boy, and Tyroc, made cameo appearances. Season 2 takes place two years after the end of Season 1. New members, such as Chameleon Boy, have joined the Legion. Superman returns, older and wiser, as does Superman X, a clone from the 41st century, to battle [[Imperiex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=11377 |title=CCI: Warner Animation Part One – Legion Of Super Heroes |first=Hannibal |last=Tabu |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date=July 28, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gG1i8RQ?url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;old=1&amp;id=11377 |archivedate=2012-08-05 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1909: The "Internationale Luftschiffahrt-Ausstellung" was first held in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], from July 10 to October 17, 1909, later becoming the ''[[Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung]] (ILA)'' and as such can lay claim to being the oldest aviation show in the world.
*1909: [[Grande Semaine d'Aviation de la Champagne]] at [[Reims]] in France in August 1909. Attended by most of the important aviators of the time, including [[Glenn Curtiss]], who won the [[Gordon Bennett Trophy (aeroplanes)|Gordon Bennett Trophy]] competition. This show inspired [[John Moisant]].

Participants included Glenn Curtiss, [[Charles K. Hamilton|Charles Hamilton]], [[Lincoln Beachey]] and [[Louis Paulhan]]. The ''Los Angeles Times'' called it "one of the greatest public events in the history of the West."
*1910: Harvard-Boston Aero Meet at the Harvard Aviation Field in [[North Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Atlantic, Massachusetts]], from September 3 to September 13, 1910. It was the first major air event in the eastern United States and offered $90,000 in prizes and appearance fees. Participants included the [[Wright brothers]], the Glenn Curtiss exhibition teams and [[Claude Grahame-White]]. This show inspired [[Harriet Quimby]] to become the first female pilot in the United States.

Participants included Count [[Jacques de Lesseps]], [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]], [[Claude Grahame-White]], Glenn Curtiss, John Moisant, [[Arch Hoxsey]], [[Ralph Johnstone]] and Charles Hamilton.
*1925–1931: [[Ford National Reliability Air Tour]] offered the Edsel B. Ford Trophy; it was inscribed, "This trophy is offered to encourage the up-building of commercial aviation as a medium of transportation."
*1945-1950: The "Thrasher Brothers Aerial Circus" featuring the Twin Ercoupe and the "World's Smallest Airport", was born after World War II when the oldest brother, Grady Thrasher, purchased some surplus planes — Piper Cubs, a Stearman biplane and two Ercoupes — from the U.S. Army for $200 to $500 each and a new 1946 Ford car. The three brothers performed aerial stunts, including one in which Bud Thrasher stood on top of the plane as it coursed the skies. Their most popular stunt was landing a plane on a wooden platform on top of a moving car, then taking off again.
*1977: Golden Wings over Richmond (October 15–16, 1977), [[Richmond, Virginia]], U.S. This mega air event commemorated the 50th anniversary (1927-1977) of both [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s historic flight from New York to Paris and of [[Richmond International Airport]] (then known as [[Richard E. Byrd|Byrd]] International Airport). Festivities included a [[World War I]] [[dogfight]]ing reenactment, a chronological fly-in of various historical aircraft from the 1900s up to the present day, performances of top aerobatic acts of the day; and a flight demonstration of the [[Concorde]], which marked the aircraft's only visit to Richmond. A severe thunderstorm shortened the October 16th show.

'''Low-power broadcasting''' refers to a [[radio station|broadcast station]] operating at a low [[electrical power]] to a smaller service area than "full power" stations within the same region, but often distinguished from "micropower broadcasting" (more commonly "[[microbroadcasting]]") and [[broadcast translator]]s. '''LPAM''', '''LPFM''' and '''LPTV''' are in various levels of use across the world, varying widely based on the [[law]]s and their [[enforcement]].
{{TOC right|limit=3}}

==Canada==
Radio communications in Canada are regulated by the Radio Communications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, a branch of [[Industry Canada]], in conjunction with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC). Interested parties must apply for both a certificate from Industry Canada and a license from CRTC in order to operate a radio station. Industry Canada manages the technicalities of spectrum space and technological requirements whereas content regulation is conducted more so by CRTC.

LPFM is broken up into two classes in Canada, Low (50 watts) and Very Low (10 watts). The transmitters therefore range from 1 to 50 watts, as opposed to 1 to 100 watts in the U.S. {{as of|2000}}, 500 licenses (very low and low-power FM) have been issued. These transmitters are generally only allowed in remote areas.

Stations in the low-power class are subject to the same CRTC licensing requirements, and will generally follow the same [[call signs in Canada|call sign]] format, as full-power stations. Stations in the very low-power class formerly had to have CRTC licenses as well, although a series of CRTC regulation changes in the early 2000s exempted most such stations from licensing; a station in this class will usually not have a conventional call sign, but will instead be identified in a naming format consisting of a four-digit number preceded by the letters CH for a television station or VF for a radio station.

The regulation of spectrum space is strict in Canada, as well having restrictions on second and third adjacent channels, along with other protections for AM and FM commercial radio. In addition, because there have been a few cases that found that FM frequencies have caused interference to the aeronautical navigation and communications (NAV/COM) spectrum (though evidence is not very concrete presently), [[pirate broadcasting|pirate radio]] regulation has remained very strict as well. However, the two regulating bodies do have certain exemptions. For example, low-power announcement transmitters that meet the requirement of Broadcasting Equipment Technical Standards 1, Limited Duration Special Events Distribution Undertakings, Temporary Resource Development Distribution Undertakings, and Public Emergency Radio Undertakings are a few instances, which according to certain criteria, may be exempt from certificate/license requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author = Industry Canada. Radiocommunications and Broadcasting Regulatory Branch, Spectrum and Telecommunications Management.|date = 2000|title = Frequently asked questions on low power FM broadcasting (RIC-40) |location = Ottawa, Canada|publisher =  Spectrum Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, there is no formal transmission power below which a television transmitter is broadcasting at low power. Industry Canada, in most cases, considers a television transmitter to be low-power if the noise-limited bounding contours are less than 20&amp;nbsp;km from the antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst.nsf/vwapj/bpr10-i1.pdf/$FILE/bpr10-i1.pdf|title = Part 10: Application and Procedures and Rules for Digital Television (DTV) Undertakings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]] residents are allowed to broadcast licence free-of-charge at a maximum of 1 watt [[EIRP]] in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7&amp;nbsp;MHz under a General User Radio License (GURL), which is issued by Radio [[Spectrum management|Spectrum Management]], managed by the [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Economic Development]]. Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500&amp;nbsp;mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour.&lt;ref name=NZRSM/&gt;

Further restrictions are in place for the protection of aeronautical services.  Use of the following frequencies is not permitted within certain boundaries approaching Auckland and Wellington airports:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rsm.govt.nz/about-rsm/pdf-and-documents-library/spectrum-policy/official-information-notices-gazette/gurl-notices/low-power-fm-broadcasting/radiocommunications-regulations-general-user-radio-licence-for-low-power-fm-broadcasting-notice-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 107.5 to 107.7 FM and 107.0 to 107.3, respectively.

There exists a 25&amp;nbsp;km [[broadcast translator]] rule: one licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25&amp;nbsp;km away from at least one of the first two transmitters.&lt;ref name=NZRSM&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rsm.govt.nz/cms/licensees/types-of-licence/general-user-licences/low-power-fm-broadcasting|title = Radiocommunications Regulations (General User Licence for Low Power FM Broadcasting) Notice 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are efforts on self-regulation of the broadcasters themselves. The NZRSM Radio Inspectors do, however, regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection.

Temporary low-power stations are allowed at times via a [[Restricted Service Licence]]. Since 2001, long-term LPFM licences have been available in remote areas of the country. These are currently used for many establishments, including [[military base]]s, universities and hospitals with fixed boundaries.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===FM radio===
Low Power FM (LPFM) is a [[non-commercial educational]] broadcast service. LPFM licenses may be issued to non-commercial educational entities, and public safety and transportation organizations. Individuals and holders of other types of broadcast licenses are not eligible to hold an LPFM license.

====LPFM classes====
* Class L1 (LP100) is to 100 [[watt]]s [[effective radiated power]] (ERP). ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})
* Class L2 (L10) is at least 1 and up to 10 watts ERP. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|811}})

In addition, Class D educational licenses exist for stations of 10 watts [[transmitter power output]] (TPO) or less, regardless of ERP. These stations are all grandfathered operations, as no new licenses of this type have been issued since 1978, except in Alaska. They are not considered to be LPFM stations, although they operate noncommercially and have similar coverage areas to Class L2 stations.

====Legislation====

=====Origins of LPFM=====
In January 2000, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] established Low Power FM (LPFM) as a new designated class of radio station. These stations were allowed to operate at 1–10 or 50–100 watts of power, compared to the minimum requirement for commercial stations at 100 watts. ({{CodeFedReg|47|73|211}}). Originally, it was supported by activists and groups and figures associated with [[Progressivism in the United States|American progressivism]]; music artists (such as [[Bonnie Raitt]]); religious leaders/churches (such as the [[United Church of Christ]]); and educators (for example, [[American Library Association]], the [[Communication Workers of America]] [[trade union|labor union]], the [[National League of Cities]].

The original purpose of LPFM was to serve as an alternative to "[[radio homogenization]]", as described in the ''J&amp;MC Quarterly Journal'', as "... Necessary to offset the growing consolidation of station ownership in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which removed caps on radio ownership, as well as the decline of locally produced radio programming."&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Alan G. Stavisky|author2 = Robert K. Avery|author3 =  Helena Vanhala|title = From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio|journal =  Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume = 78|date = 2001|pages = 340–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main opposition to LPFMs came from the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] (NAB), which opposed the act on grounds to "maintain spectrum integrity" for commercial broadcasting, according to NAB President Edward O. Fritts.&lt;ref name="Class D to LPFM"/&gt;

=====Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000=====&lt;!-- linked from "National Association of Broadcasters" --&gt;
Pressure from the National Association of Broadcasters urged [[United States Congress|Congress]] to slip the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 into a general spending bill that circulated through Congress. President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the bill in December 2000, albeit reluctantly{{Weasel inline|date=November 2018}}. The actual bill that went through Congress [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&amp;dbname=cp106&amp;sid=cp106nfZjS&amp;refer=&amp;r_n=hr567.106&amp;item=&amp;sel=TOC_12219&amp; ] was meant to tighten standards for LPFM stations, in an effort to make it harder for stations to be approved in order to protect full-power FM stations had these provisions:
# The FCC has the ability and jurisdiction to license LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 1999|title = H.R. 3439 [106th]: Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h106-3439&amp;tab=summary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Third adjacent channel interference protections require LPFM stations to be separated by at least 0.6&amp;nbsp;MHz from all other stations with the intent of preventing signal interference.
# Applicants who have engaged in the unlicensed operation of any station cannot receive LPFM licenses.
# The FCC agreed to commission studies on the interference effects and economic impact of LPFM on full-power stations (the findings, later published in the ''[[MITRE Corporation]] Report'', suggest that third adjacent channel interference protections may not be necessary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Radio Magazine|date = March 1, 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = March 3, 2008|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409100247/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = April 9, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This act basically shifted policy making from the FCC to Congress, which was considered an insult against the FCC. (Stavisky, Alan G., Robert K. Avery, and Helena Vanhala. "From Class D to LPFM: The High-Powered Politics of Low-Power Radio." Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly 78 (2001): 340–54.)

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2005=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2005 was introduced by Senators [[John McCain]], [[Maria Cantwell]] and [[Patrick Leahy]]. After the FCC complied with the provisions of the Radio Broadcasting Act of 2000 by commissioning [http://www.recnet.net/mitre/2.pdf the MITRE Report] to test if there was significant interference from LPFM stations on the full-power stations, the study showed that the interference of LPFM is minimal and would not have a significant effect on other stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html Current.org|title = Mitre study on LPFM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110525090155/http://www.current.org/tech/tech0314lpfm.html|archivedate = 2011-05-25|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sen. Leahy, "This bill will open up the airwaves to truly local broadcasting while protecting full-power broadcasters from unreasonable interference and preserving important services such as reading services for the blind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://mccain.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressOffice.PressReleases&amp;ContentRecord_id=8904246a-cd92-489c-81b1-48d8eddc4298&amp;Region_id=&amp;Issue_id=|title = United States Senator John McCain :: Press Office :&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2007=====
Sponsored in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] by Congressmen [[Mike Doyle (Pennsylvania politician)|Mike Doyle]] and [[Lee Terry]] and in the [[United States Senate]] by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain, the Local Community Radio Act of 2007 failed to be voted on. The House bill, H.R. 2802, was referred to the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet on June 21, 2007.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2007|title = H.R. 2802: Local Community Radio Act of 2007|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the bill was not passed in FY 2007, the bill was removed from the docket as ''Never Passed''.

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2009=====
This bill was an update of the Local Community Radio Act of 2007. It would have required the FCC to alter current rules in order to get rid of the minimum distance separation between low-power FM stations and third-adjacent channel stations.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"&gt;{{cite web|date = 2009|title = H.R. 1147, The Local Community Radio Act of 2009|access-date =  May 23, 2009|url = http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/111_HR_1147.html#toc2|publisher = Washington Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, there was a minimum distance requirement; however the FCC found that LPFM stations did not cause any interference on third-adjacent channel stations, thus eliminating the need for such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = RADIO magazine - The Radio Technology Leader|date = 2004|title = FCC Reports LPFM Interference Findings to Congress|access-date = May 24, 2009|url = http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081012040159/http://www.mediaaccess.org/programs/lpfm/RADIOmagazine.pdf|archivedate = October 12, 2008|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Community Radio Act of 2009 also would have required that the FCC keep the rules that offer interference protection to third-adjacent channels that offer a [[radio reading service]] (the reading of newspapers, books or magazines for those who are blind or hearing impaired).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = KPBS Radio Reading Service|title = About|access-date = May 23, 2009|url = http://kpbsreadingservice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This protection will ensure that such channels are not subject to possible interference by LPFM stations.&lt;ref name="govtrack.us"/&gt;

The final part of the bill required that when giving out licenses to FM stations, the FCC must make sure that these licenses are also available to LPFM stations and that licensing decisions are made with regard to local community needs.&lt;ref name="ww-111hr1147"/&gt; The bill had unanimous bipartisan support from FCC leadership. It was passed by the House and referred to the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ4TC9Aqjfc|title=FCC: Unanimous, bipartisan support for LPFM|date=September 18, 2009|author=[[United States Congress]]|publisher=[[Free Press (organization)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Local Community Radio Act of 2010=====
The Local Community Radio Act of 2010 (based upon the legislation originally introduced in 2005) was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] on January 4, 2011 as {{USPL|111|371}}, after passage in the House on December 17, 2010, and the U.S. Senate on December 18, 2010. In a statement after the bill became law, Federal Communications Commission chairman [[Julius Genachowski]] said, "Low power FM stations are small, but they make a giant contribution to local community programming. This important law eliminates the unnecessary restrictions that kept these local stations off the air in cities and towns across the country." The Act states that the Federal Communications Commission, when licensing new FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations, should ensure that licenses are available to FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations; such decisions are made based on the needs of the local community; and FM translator stations, FM booster stations, and low-power FM stations remain equal in status and secondary to existing and modified full-service FM stations.

In general, the FCC was to modify its rules to eliminate third-adjacent minimum distance separation requirements between low-power FM stations; and full-service FM stations, FM translator stations, and FM booster stations.

====Arguments for LPFM====
*[[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], a non-partisan advocacy organization pushing for media reform, specifically in promoting "diversity and independent media ownership, strong public media, and universal access to communications,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper = Free Press|date = 2008|title = Local Radio Now|access-date =  February 12, 2008|url = http://www.freepress.net/lpfm/}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced its support of LPFM for a variety of reasons:
** It strengthens community identity.
** It creates an outlet for amateur musicians to get their music heard.
** It creates diversity on the air because women and racial minorities are represented.
** It creates an opportunity for young people, especially college students, who are interested in radio to learn about the business.
** It provides farmers with up to date agricultural information.
*[[Prometheus Radio Project]], a non-profit organization that "builds, supports, and advocates for community radio stations which empower participatory community voices and movements for social change,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project|date = 2009|title = About Prometheus Radio Project|access-date = February 10, 2011|url = http://www.prometheusradio.org/about_us}}&lt;/ref&gt; also supported LPFM, citing these reasons:
** The media should not limit democratic participation but should provide a way for communities and movements to express themselves
** Public airwaves shouldn't be concentrated in private/corporate hands
** Low Power FM gives a voice to communities
** Low Power FM needs to be protected from big broadcasters

A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = B. Stelter|date = January 11, 2011|title = Low-Power FM Radio to Gain Space on the Dial|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/arts/25radio.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on a LPFM station called KOCZ highlights a number of key arguments for LPFM:
* "In Louisiana, a large African-American community appreciate how LPFM plays a genre of music called [[zydeco]], a potent blend of [[Cajun music|Cajun]], [[rhythm and blues]] and, among a younger generation, [[hip-hop]], often features accordion and washboard.“
* LPFM influences commercial radio to offer listeners a wider range of music. “Commercial stations had started playing more zydeco since KOCZ started broadcasting in 2002. 'They know that we make them better,' an advocate said.”
* Because LPFM is non-commercial, schools and organizations are able to promote many community service-related projects that help better the local neighborhood. "KOCZ is licensed to the Southern Development Foundation, a civil rights group that grants scholarships and runs a business incubator but has fallen on hard times. The foundation treats the station as a 24-hour form of community outreach. "
* LPFM promotes a very close community. "A woman walked into the station ... asked for an announcement to be broadcast about her lost dog... 'She was able to get her dog back the next day’”
* LPFM is crucial for small communities in times of emergencies. “A low power FM radio station can stay on the air even if the power goes out. Low power FM saved lives during Katrina.”

Former President Bill Clinton is a known advocate of LPFM saying it is "giving voice to the voiceless", including schools, community groups, churches, and ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Mike Janssen|date = January 15, 2001|title = Intervention by Congress slashes LPFM licensing 80%|newspaper = Current|access-date = February 11, 2008|url = http://www.current.org/tech/tech0101lpfm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown Paper Tickets CEO Steve Butcher supports LPFM, stating in a letter to the FCC, "We hear from event producers frequently who can't afford radio ad buys on commercial stations. These local entrepreneurs can afford underwriting on smaller stations that can help build awareness about their events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Brown Paper Tickets|date = September 13, 2011|title = Brown Paper Tickets CEO Makes Voice Heard for Low Power FM|access-date = September 13, 2011|url = http://www.brownpapertickets.com/pressrelease/100008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LPFM stations are considered to be affordable compared to an average FM station, whose operating costs can run up to a million dollars, and could only afforded by businesses and the very wealthy. An antenna and transmitter can cost between $2,000 and $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = HowStuffWorks|date = 2000|title = What is low-power FM LPFM?|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/question330.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against LPFM====
* Signal interference on FM station – High-power FM stations express concern that LPFM stations may cause interference with their signals if third adjacent-channel interference protections are not observed. While the Mitre Report suggests that the likelihood for interference is not as threatening as previously thought, high-power FM stations question the methodology, scope and validity of the study and its results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LPFM Report Fatally Flawed |work=Radio TechCheck |publisher=[[National Association of Broadcasters]] |date=October 20, 2003 |url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114101516/http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search&amp;template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=4666 |archivedate=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* FM translators – These devices allow a radio station to rebroadcast its signal to reach a greater area. FM translators could benefit religious broadcasters wishing to reach a larger audience, as well as many AM radio stations who, due to [[Ionospheric reflection|ionospheric refraction]], are required to emit weaker signals during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Ron Whittaker|date = June 14, 2007|title = Elements of Mass Communication: AM FM Waves and Sound|access-date = February 12, 2008|url = http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/frtv017.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; FM translators are low-power, so compete with LPFM for limited space on the airwaves.
* In some states, the local [[Department of Transportation]] operates large networks of LPFM stations that act as [[highway advisory radio]] stations – a service traditionally operated at the fringes of the [[amplitude modulation|AM]] band – restricting the number of available channels{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} (these systems can be licensed to the entire AM band, but the LPFM service provides considerably greater coverage at 100 watts than the 10-watt limit on AM – hence the considerable appeal for government agencies).
* Some investors in radio believe LPFM services prevent the development of [[digital radio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Factsheets|access-date = May 29, 2008|url = http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Mass_Media/Factsheets?lpfmfact032900.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[NPR]] is a major opponent to low-power FM. Their stance is that allowing more flexible rules for LPFM would burden other stations by forcing them to deal with interference problems and because full-power broadcasters reach a broader audience and provide a greater service, they should be favored regarding spectrum availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Everhart |first=Karen |title=Pubradio rejects higher status for low-power |newspaper=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]] |date=May 12, 2008 |url=http://www.current.org/fcc/fcc0808lpfm.shtml |access-date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Everhart |first=Karen |author2=jonathan  |title=Once again NPR opposes expansion of low-power FM |publisher=reclaimthemedia.org |date=May 21, 2008 |url=http://www.reclaimthemedia.org/grassroots_media/once_again_npr_opposes_expansi%3D5996 |access-date=October 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The National Association of Broadcasters is the other major source of opposition. Its stance is that full-power FM broadcasters “enhance localism” by providing community-responsive information such as emergency information. Allowing low-power FM stations to have equal spectrum rights could be detrimental to these necessary programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MacBride |first=Marsha J. |last2=Timmerman |first2=Jerianne |last3=Bobeck |first3=Ann W. |title=Comments of the National Association of Broadcasters |work=Before the FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION |format=PDF |publisher=National Association of Broadcasters |date=August 22, 2005 |url=http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search§ion=20055&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=367 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112638/http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Search%C2%A7ion=20055&amp;template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentFileID=367 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 14, 2009 |access-date=October 14, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LPFM vs. broadcast translators====
{{See also|Broadcast relay station#Great Translator Invasion of 2003}}
Unlike the former [[list of broadcast station classes#FM|FM class D]] license, an LPFM station has no priority over broadcast translators in the allocation of available spectrum. This is problematic insofar as the regulations for [[broadcast translator]]s exempts non-commercial stations from the requirement that translators be within the coverage area of the original station that they rebroadcast. However, this provision only affects translators in the non-commercial portion of the band.  Stations in the commercial part of the spectrum must be fed over the air unless they are within the actual service area of the primary station.  Since the translator window of 2003 was only open for commercial channels, the use of directly-fed via satellite FM translators, commonly called "Satellators", was never a factor in the 2003 window.

The FCC licensing window for new translator applications in 2003 resulted in over 13,000 applications being filed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.radioworld.com/article/translator-39flood39-causes-concern/16974 |title=Translator 'Flood' Causes Concern |date=10 September 2003 |author=Naina Narayana Chernoff |accessdate=2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of them coming from a few religious broadcasters.  However even though all translators on commercial frequencies must be fed by a direct, over-the-air source, regardless of who owns the translator per FCC rule 74.1231(b),&lt;ref&gt;{{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the actual over-the-air source (the primary station) can be satellite fed, just as commercial stations can be fed by satellite. This leads to programming from a single station (retransmitted by many others) ending up on several hundred different translators. One station cannot apply for hundreds or thousands of translators nationwide, using automated means to generate license applications for all available channels, unless all of their applications are exclusively on the non-commercial part of the broadcast band (88–91.9&amp;nbsp;MHz). ({{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231(b)}}) As with any new service that shares the FM spectrum, when translators are added to an area, they can reduce or eliminate the availability of channels both for new LPFM applicants and for relocation of any existing LPFM stations displaced by full-service broadcasters. Unlike an LPFM station, a translator is not required to (and legally not authorized to) originate any local content except as permitted by {{CodeFedReg|47|74|1231|(g)}}.  Thus there is competition for spectrum in some locations between the LPFM service and the FM translator service.

In May 2018, several groups supporting community-based low-power FM stations filed objections with the FCC, citing the [[Local Community Radio Act]], accusing it of favoring existing station coverage expansion with translator licenses - "a spectrum grab" - over new LPFM spectrum licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ashworth|first1=Susan|title=LPFM Advocates File Objections to Nearly 1,000 Applications|url=https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/lpfm-advocates-file-objections-to-nearly-1000-applications|website=Radio World|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobson|first1=Adam|title=Are Hundreds Of Pending FM Translators In Jeopardy? {{!}} Radio &amp; Television Business Report|url=https://www.rbr.com/local-comm-radio-act/|website=www.rbr.com|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prometheus May 2018 translator objections"&gt;{{cite web|title=Low-power FM radio advocates file 1,000 Objections with FCC {{!}} Prometheus Radio Project|url=https://www.prometheusradio.org/InformalObjections20180516|website=www.prometheusradio.org|accessdate=28 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AM radio===
{{see also|AM broadcasting#Microbroadcasting}}
The acronym 'LPAM' is not a legal term in the United States and is only used in this article as a (conventional) abbreviation. Unlike LPFM stations, which have legal and regulatory status, FCC rules do not define "LPAM" nor issue licenses for low-power AM transmission. LPAM is only an acronym applied to licensed low-power AM operations and to Part 15 transmissions as well.

Any "low power AM" in FCC licensing for stations in the United States is the requirement for higher-power licensed AM stations to reduce their transmit power at nighttime or post-sunset / pre-sunrise as part of their FCC broadcast authorization. There is a category ''Class&amp;nbsp;D'' for AM broadcast licenses, which limited stations to daytime-only transmission before regulations changed in the 1980s. Many, but not all, Class&amp;nbsp;D stations have been granted authority to broadcast at night with enough power to be heard within a few miles of their transmitters.

Other LPAM operations are known as [[Travelers' Information Stations]] (TIS), sometimes also called highway advisory radio (HAR). Authorized under FCC Part 90.242, these are stations licensed to local transportation departments or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies to provide bulletins to motorists regarding traffic conditions. These are often near highways and airports, and occasionally other tourism attractions such as [[national park]]s. Some are used by chemical and nuclear facilities for emergency evacuation information systems, others by public safety entities for mobile operations.

Music is not allowed on TIS/HAR stations and they are restricted to only 3&amp;nbsp;kHz wide, "[[High fidelity|low-fidelity audio]]" as well, compared to the 10&amp;nbsp;kHz audio for standard AM broadcasters and 15&amp;nbsp;kHz audio permitted on FM stations. (Modern AM stations in the US actually restrict their audio to 5&amp;nbsp;kHz down to 2.5&amp;nbsp;kHz - roughly the same as to TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radioworld.com/tech-and-gear/5-khz-audio-bandwidth-on-am|title=5 kHz Audio Bandwidth on AM|author=|date=|website=radioworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Travelers' Information Stations|TIS]] transmissions are normally authorized for 10&amp;nbsp;Watts or less, although some higher authorizations exist, primarily in locations where emergency evacuation may become necessary. The 60&amp;nbsp;Watt TIS stations on 1640 and 1680&amp;nbsp;kHz at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] have the highest licensed power among full-time TIS stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/letterPdf/LetterPdfController?licId=1236825&amp;letterVersionId=52&amp;autoLetterId=0&amp;letterCode=AZ&amp;radioServiceCode=PW&amp;op=LetterPdf&amp;licSide=Y&amp;letterTo=L%20%20%20%20&amp;archive=nul&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
There are more than 2,450 licensed low-power television (LPTV) stations in the U.S., which are located in markets of all sizes, from [[New York City]] (five stations, though more exist in the market from other [[city of license|cities of license]]) down to [[Junction City, Kansas]] (two stations).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

LPTV (-LP) and LPTV Digital (-LD) are common in the U.S., Canada and most of the [[Americas]], where most stations originate their own programming. Stations that do not originate their own programming are designated as [[broadcast relay station#translator stations|translator]]s (-TX). The Community Broadcasters Act of 1998 directed the FCC to create a classification of LPTV licenses called [[Class A television service|Class A]] (-CA). Digital low-power and Class-A television stations have an ERP limit of 3,000 watts (3&amp;nbsp;kW) for VHF, and 15 kilowatts for UHF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fcc.gov/mb/video/files/afcce.ppt|title = FCC Slideshow, slide 56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LPTV service is considered a secondary service by the FCC, which means the licensee is not guaranteed protection from interference or displacement. An LPTV station must accept harmful interference from full-service television stations and may not cause harmful interference to any full-service television station (the FCC defines interference levels deemed to be "harmful"). The problem with potential displacement was made evident during the [[Digital television transition in the United States|transition of broadcasting in the United States from analog to digital]]. All television stations operating on UHF channels 52 and above were required to move to channel 51 or below. Full-service stations were guaranteed a place to land in the new compressed band while LPTV stations operating on channels 52 and above were required to either find their own channel or lose their license.

====Class A LPTV stations====
The FCC provided a one-time filing opportunity for existing LPTV stations to become Class A stations. The designation was only available to LPTV stations that were producing two hours per week of local programming. Class A stations had to maintain a production studio within their Grade B contour, and comply with many of the requirements placed on full-service television stations. This allowed them to obtain protected channel status.

====Must-carry====
One of the key distinctions between full-service television stations and low-power stations is [[cable television]] and [[direct broadcast satellite]] (DBS) carriage. Full-service stations are guaranteed carriage in their local [[media market|television market]] through "[[must-carry]]" whereas LPTV stations are not. In 2008, there was an effort put forward by FCC chairman Kevin Martin to grant must-carry rights to Class A LPTV stations. The effort failed due to a lack of support from the other FCC Commissioners.

====Network affiliates====
Though many low-power television stations are either unaffiliated, or broadcast programming from small networks meant for their use, some LPTV stations are affiliated with major broadcast networks like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], [[The CW]] or [[MyNetworkTV]]. Examples include in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] with [[NBC]] on [[WBTS-LD]], [[Youngstown, Ohio]], where a pair of LPTV stations based at [[WYFX-LD]] broadcast Fox programming, along with the [[digital subchannel]] of the co-owned [[CBS]] affiliate, [[WKBN-TV]], or in the [[Lima, Ohio]] area, whose low-power stations are affiliates of major networks, such as [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].

====Digital transition====
On July 15, 2011, the FCC issued an order to low-power broadcasters that effectively requires all remaining television transmitters to vacate channels 52 to 69 by December 31, 2011. In that same order, the FCC effectively required all remaining analog transmitters to have shut down by March 29, 2016.

Unlike AM and FM, unlicensed use of television bands is prohibited for broadcasting. The [[amateur television]] channels do allow for some very limited non-entertainment transmissions however, with some [[repeater]]s airing [[NASA TV]] during [[Space Shuttle]] [[Space exploration|mission]]s when they are not in local use.

The low-power television industry was represented by the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA), which held its annual convention each year in October and an annual meeting each year in April at the National Association of Broadcasters Convention in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. The meeting was always held on the Monday night of the NAB convention in Ballroom B of the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and was open to anyone interested in the low-power television industry.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} On August 13, 2009, the CBA announced in a statement that it would shut down after 20 years of representing LPTV stations. One reason given was the "restrictive regulations that kept the Class A and LPTV industry from realizing its potential". Another was the inability to reach most viewers, partly due to [[Multichannel Video Programming Distributor]]s refusing to carry these channels. In addition, Amy Brown, former CBA executive director, said, "some 40% of Class A and LPTV station operators believe they will have to shut down in the next year if they are not helped through the digital transition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/327560-Community_Broadcasters_Association_to_Shutter.php?rssid=20068&amp;q=digital+tv|title=Community Broadcasters Association to Shutter|work=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006, the FCC released its Notices of Proposed Rules for Digital Radio. The Commission reaffirms its commitment to provide broadcasters with the opportunity to take advantage of [[digital audio broadcasting]] (DAB) technology, proposed criteria for evaluating models and systems, such as the In Band On Channel (IBOC) system, and inquired on the needs for a mandatory DAB transmission standard.

In section 39 of the Notice, the FCC inquires as how to balance incentives for broadcasters to switch to digital systems with incumbents of new entrance opportunities, stating that they “seek analyses of the minimum power levels that would preserve service within protected service areas in an all-digital environment, and alternatively, the levels that would not result in significant disruptions to current listening patterns.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website = Prometheus Radio Project, Initials|date = February 12, 2006|title =  Review of fcc proposed rules for digital radio and impact for lpfm|url = http://prometheusradio.org/node/139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DAB system that has been identified as the best fit for LPFM is IBOC system. This is a hybrid system that uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the digital carriers require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. Currently, imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Michelle Eyre|date = September 21, 2008|title =  A Comparitive[sic] overview of digital audio broadcasting (dab) systems|url = http://home.recnet.com/dab}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marvin the Martian in the Third Dimension''''' (also titled '''''Marvin the Martian in 3D''''' and '''''Marvin the Martian in 4D''''') is a [[3-D film|3-D]] [[Looney Tunes]] film which was formerly an attraction at [[Drayton Manor Theme Park]] in [[Drayton Bassett]], [[Staffordshire]], [[England]], [[Warner Bros. Movie World]] in [[Gold Coast, Australia]], [[Movie Park Germany|Warner Bros. Movie World]] in [[Bottrop, Germany]] (now [[Movie Park Germany]]) and [[Six Flags Great America]]. The movie was the first computer animated movie viewed with 3D glasses to be produced in the world.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://korean.movieworld.com.au/about_us/our_history.cfm?history_id=23 Our History ''A Timeline Of Warner Bros. Movie World'' (Official site)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080721213618/http://korean.movieworld.com.au/about_us/our_history.cfm?history_id=23 |date=21 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 26 December ([[Boxing Day]]), 1997, the film opened at Warner Bros. Movie World on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Australia]]. The attraction opened at the [[Roxy Theatre (Warner Bros. Movie World)|Roxy Theatre]] in Main Street.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; It mixed the old art of [[Anaglyph image|anaglyphic]] or [[Polarized glasses|polarized]] film (viewed with 3D glasses), and the relatively new art of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] (the first CGI feature-film (Toy Story) was made only 2 years before).&lt;ref name="marvin"&gt;[http://www.didik.com/3d_film.htm Directory of 3-D (Stereo) Motion Pictures 1922 - 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toystory"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/ Toy Story at the Internet Movie Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, it was simultaneously screened at the cinema in the Warner Bros. Store in New York. During scenes when Daffy Duck spoke, the audience was sprinkled with water. A large minted token embossed with Marvin the Martian was given on entrance, and could be redeemed for merchandise.

In 2005, the Roxy Theatre saw Marvin the Martian in 3D ending its run and being replaced with [[Shrek 4-D|Shrek 4D Adventure]] which also includes added real world effects to immerse the viewers into the film such as wind, water and smells.

One year later the film began showing at the [[Pictorium]] at Six Flags Great America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgamworld.com/attractions/shows.php Unofficial site of Six Flags Great America]&lt;/ref&gt; Though, the much larger screen size of the [[Pictorium]] suggests that there may differences from the original film seen in Australia. The version in the Pictorium started showing in 2006 and ceased two years later in May 2008.

In 2011, Drayton Manor announced that they would be replacing [[Happy Feet 4-D Experience]] with Marvin the Martian in 4D. Marvin the Martian began showing at the start of the season on 19 March 2011, and has been there ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick|title=Drayton Manor to add Marvin the Martian 4D movie for 2011 season|url=http://www.themeparktourist.com/news/20110310/3249/drayton-manor-add-marvin-martian-4d-movie-2011-season|work=10 March 2011|publisher=Theme Park Tourist|accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2011, this film was released on the [[Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 1]] Blu-ray. It is not in 3D.

==Plot==
The film is based around the two [[Looney Tunes]] characters [[Marvin the Martian]] and [[Daffy Duck]]. "While scanning the universe for signs of hostility, Marvin hears something that sounds like a threat from Earth. Daffy's preparation for his movie role as a dreaded Martian fighter causes the confusion, which results in intergalactic mayhem of comic proportions."&lt;ref name="marvinarchive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieworld.com.au/rides_attractions/ride_marvin_martian.cfm |title=Warner Bros.

The term "'''mediascape'''", coined by [[Arjun Appadurai]] (1990), refers to the electronic and print media in "global cultural flows". For Appadurai, mediascape indexes the electronic capabilities of production and dissemination, as well as "the images of the world created by these media".&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicculture.dukejournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/2/2/1 (Appadurai 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;9)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such [[image]]ry comes from books, [[magazine]]s, [[television]],  [[Film|cinema]], and, above all, [[advertising]] that can directly impact the [[landscape]] (in the form of [[poster]]s and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]]s) and also subtly influence, through persuasive techniques and an increasingly pervasive presence, the way that people perceive [[reality]].

The word ''mediascape'' also describes [[visual culture]]. For example, ''"the American mediascape is becoming increasingly partisan"'' or simply to denote "what's on" as in ''"a quick survey of the British mediascape shows how much [[Channel 4]] has lost its way"''.

The term ''Mediascape'' was first used in trade by the U.S. company [[Mediascape Corporation]], formed in 1992, for the purpose of delivering [[rich media]] through the Internet and Web. Mediascape is the U.S. owner of the Federal [[trademark]] for use of that mark in relation to [[multimedia]] products in commerce.

''Mediascape'' is also used as a generic term to describe a digital media artifact where items of digital media are associated with regions in space and can then be triggered by the location of the person experiencing the media. Thus in a mediascape a person may walk around an area and as they do so they will hear digitally stored sounds associated with different places in that area.

A '''minstrel''' was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]]an [[entertainer]]. Originally describing any type of entertainer such as a [[musician]], [[juggler]], [[acrobatics|acrobat]], [[singer]] or [[Bouffon|fool]], the term later, from the sixteenth century, came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Southworth|first1=John|title=The English Medieval Minstrel|date=1989|publisher=The Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge, Suffolk|isbn=0 85115 536 7|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Minstrels performed songs which told stories of distant places or of existing or imaginary historical events. Although minstrels created their own tales, often they would memorize and embellish the works of others.&lt;ref&gt;A history of English literature: in a series of biographical sketches, By William Francis Collier&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently they were retained by royalty and high society. As the courts became more sophisticated, minstrels were eventually replaced at court by the [[troubadour]]s, and many became wandering minstrels, performing in the streets; a decline in their popularity began in the late 15th century. Minstrels fed into later traditions of travelling entertainers, which continued to be moderately strong into the early 20th century, and which has some continuity in the form of today's [[busking|buskers]] or street musicians. 

Initially, minstrels were simply treats at court, and entertained the lord and courtiers with ''[[chansons de geste]]'' or their local equivalent. The term ''minstrel'' derives from [[Old French]] ''ménestrel'' (also ''menesterel, menestral''), which is a derivative from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''ministrello'' (later ''menestrello''), from Middle Latin ''ministralis'' "retainer", an adjective form of [[Latin]] ''minister'', "attendant" from ''minus'', "lesser".

In [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]] before the [[Norman Conquest]], the professional poet was known as a ''[[scop]]'' ("shaper" or "maker"), who composed his own poems, and sang them to the accompaniment of a [[harp]]. In a rank much beneath the ''scop'' were the ''[[gleemen]]'', who had no settled abode, but roamed about from place to place, earning what they could from their performances. Late in the 13th century, the term ''minstrel'' began to be used to designate a performer who amused his lord with music and song.  Following a series of invasions, wars, conquests, etc., two categories of composers developed. Poets like [[Chaucer]] and [[John Gower]] appeared in one category, wherein music was not a part. Minstrels, on the other hand, gathered at feasts and festivals in great numbers with harps, [[fiddle]]s, [[bagpipe]]s, [[flute]]s, [[flageolet]]s, [[cittern]]s, and [[kettledrum]]s. Additionally, minstrels were known for their involvement in political commentary and engaged in propaganda. They often reported news with bias to sway opinion and revised works to encourage action in favor of equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = History of Oral Interpretation|last = Bahn|first = Eugene|publisher = Burgess Publishing Company|year = 1970|isbn = |location = Minneapolis, MN|pages = 72|last2 = Bahn|first2 = Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music of the [[troubadours]] and [[trouvères]] was performed by minstrels called ''joglars'' (Occitan) or ''jongleurs'' (French). As early as 1321, the minstrels of [[Paris]] were formed into a [[guild]]. A guild of royal minstrels was organized in [[England]] in 1469. Minstrels were required to either join the guild or abstain from practicing their craft. Some minstrels were retained by lords as [[jester]]s who, in some cases, also practiced the art of [[juggling]]. Some were women, or women who followed minstrels in their travels. Minstrels throughout Europe also employed trained animals, such as [[bear]]s. Minstrels in Europe died out slowly, having gone nearly extinct by about 1700, although isolated individuals working in the tradition existed even into the early 19th century.

==In literature==
Minstrelsy became a central concern in English literature in the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] and has remained so intermittently.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Maureen N. McLane: ''Balladeering, Minstrelsy, and the Making of British Romantic Poetry'' (Cambridge, UK: CUP, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In poetry, ''The Lay of the Last Minstrel'' (1805) by Sir [[Walter Scott]], ''Lalla Rookh'' (1817) by [[Thomas Moore]], and ''The Village Minstrel'' (1821) by [[John Clare]] were three of many. Novels centring on minstrelsy have included [[Helen Craik]]'s ''Henry of Northumberland'' (1800), [[Sydney Owenson]]'s ''The Novice of St. Dominick's'' (a girl using a minstrel disguise, 1805), [[Christabel Rose Coleridge]]'s ''Minstrel Dick'' (a choirboy turned minstrel becomes a courtier, 1891), [[Rhoda Power]]'s ''Redcap Runs Away'' (a boy of ten joins wandering minstrels, 1952), and [[A. J. Cronin]]'s ''The Minstrel Boy'' (priesthood to minstrelsy and back, 1975).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2069">A '''museme''' is a minimal unit of [[music]]al meaning, analogous to a [[morpheme]] in [[linguistics]], "the basic unit of musical expression which in the framework of one given musical system is not further divisible without destruction of meaning." A museme may:
:be broken down into component parts which are not in themselves meaningful within the framework of the musical language...but are nevertheless basic elements (not units) of musical expression which, when altered, may be compared to the phonemes of speech in that they alter the museme (morpheme) of which they are part and may thereby also alter its meaning.&lt;ref name=Tagg1979/&gt;{{rp|71}}

The term was brought to popularity by [[Philip Tagg]],&lt;ref name=Tagg1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tagg2013/&gt; derived from the work of [[Charles Seeger]].&lt;ref name=Middleton1990/&gt;{{rp|189}}

'''Musematic repetition''' ("repetition of musemes"&lt;ref name=Middleton1990/&gt;{{rp|269}}) is simple [[Repetition (music)|repetition]] "at the level of the short figure, often used to generate an entire structural framework."&lt;ref name=Middleton1990/&gt;{{rp|189}} and contrasted with discursive repetition, in which the repetition is not so precise.

At the time, Ronnie Cohen, the lead actor, was a nine year old boy born in Britain to a Zionist family and immigrated to Israel when he was three.

This is an English speaking film because it was made for the American-Jewish audience. The budget was provided mainly from wealthy Israelies and Americans and the residue from the Zionist institutes.

The NBC ('''National Broadcasting Corporation''') is [[Papua New Guinea]]'s state owned broadcaster. Its head office is in Boroko, [[Port Moresby]], and has approximately 20 locations around the country.

The NBC was set up by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] before independence in 1973. On 1 December 1973 the NBC (the National Broadcasting Commission as it was known at the time) was handed over to the Papua New Guinea government.

Two national radio stations - NBC Radio and Tribe - and the television station operate from the head office.

'''Nickels''' is a betting game played with any desired [[denomination (currency)|denomination]] of coins. It is played on a flat, hard surface next to a back wall, such as the side of a building or a street curb.  The objective of Nickels is to place your coin closer to the wall than your opponents.

==Play area==
The play area consists of the following.
*A foul line, of which players are forbidden to step over during a throw.
*A goal line at the opposite side of the foul line
*Boundary lines at each side of the field of play, which spectators or coins are not allowed to cross.

==Rules==
Rules of the game, some necessary and others not, include:
*The foul line can not be crossed during a throw, doing so results in immediate loss of the round.
*The coin will not be scored, and will be lost, if it leaves the boundary area.
*Bouncing the coin off the goal line is permitted.
*If the time is not taken to clear a proper area, and no boundary lines are set, a coin is in "interference" if it touches any obstacle (such as a backpack). Coins in interference are lost as if they went out of bounds.
*Play is separated into rounds, of which the winner collects all the coins played unless specified that the round is "friendly" or "for practice."

'''Nightlife''' is a collective term for [[entertainment]] that is available and generally more popular from the late evening into the early hours of the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nightlife|title=Nightlife - Definition of nightlife by Merriam-Webster|author=|date=|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may include [[pub]]s, [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], [[nightclub]]s, [[party|parties]], live [[music]], [[concert]]s, [[cabaret]]s, [[theatre]], [[movie theatre|cinemas]], and shows. These venues often require a [[cover charge]] for admission. Nightlife entertainment is often more [[adult]]-oriented than daytime entertainment. People who prefer to be active during the night-time are called [[Night owl (person)|night owls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Time|last = Klein|first = Stefan|publisher = |year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociological research ==

Nightlife has been a vibrant area of research for sociologists. Nightlife establishments including pubs, bars, and nightclubs function as [[third place]]s, according to [[Ray Oldenburg]] in ''[[The Great Good Place]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pps.org/reference/roldenburg|title=Ray Oldenburg|author=|date=|work=Project for Public Spaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sociologists have argued that vibrant city nightlife scenes contribute to the development of culture as well as political movements. David Grazian cites as examples the development of [[beat poetry]], musical styles including [[bebop]], urban blues and early rock, and the importance of nightlife for the development of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States kicked off by the [[Stonewall riots|riots at the Stonewall Inn nightclub]].&lt;ref name="Grazian"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=40542603|title=Urban Nightlife, Social Capital, and the Public Life of Cities|first=David|last=Grazian|journal=Sociological Forum|volume=24|number=4|year=2009|pages=908–917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate about the degree to which nightlife contributes positively to [[social capital]] and the public goods of society. David Grazian points out that nightlife can "replicate the same structures of race, ethnic, and class inequality and exclusion found in the larger society."&lt;ref name="Grazian" /&gt;

Grazian cites the use of dress codes by some nightlife establishments in the United States—mostly nightclubs—that specifically targets clothing popularised by hip hop culture represents a form of informal discrimination and segregation on racial grounds.&lt;ref name="Grazian" /&gt;

Grazian also notes that nightclubs and club culture can create an environment that encourage or tolerate the "harassment and degradation of women," citing the expectation that both female workers and patrons of bars and nightclubs engage in highly sexualized performances of femininity including dressing in a particularly sexual manner in order to gain entrance to clubs.&lt;ref name="Grazian" /&gt;

== Regulation ==
=== Australia ===

Nightlife venues must be licensed to serve alcohol

=== United Kingdom ===

Nightlife venues must be licensed to serve alcohol under the [[Licensing Act 2003]] (and the [[Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005]] in Scotland). Venues with door security ("bouncers") are also required to ensure that the security staff are licensed by the [[Security Industry Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licensing Act 2003|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/17/contents|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the [[Licensing Act 2003]], pubs and bars have been able to apply to operate until later. For nightclubs, this has become a form of competition as patrons can stay in the same pub or bar rather than move on to a club.&lt;ref name="Moss2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Moss|title=The Entertainment Industry: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3Vi0RyXc5wC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2010|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-551-1|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===

In the United States, [[Nightlife legislation of the United States|legislation affecting nightlife]] was created after the 2006 [[murder]]s of [[Murder of Imette St. Guillen|Imette St. Guillen]] and [[Murder of Jennifer Moore|Jennifer Moore]], after which American teenagers' use of [[Identity document forgery|fake IDs]] to obtain access to nightclubs was brought to attention.&lt;ref name="msnvideo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.msn.com/v/us/msnbc.htm?g=b23a2d0d-cce5-4db5-8709-5b56fc46ab10&amp;f=00 |title=Latest in St. Guillen investigation |work=Dateline |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322094415/http://video.msn.com/v/us/msnbc.htm?g=b23a2d0d-cce5-4db5-8709-5b56fc46ab10&amp;f=00 |archivedate=March 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the limited range available to each player, many of the pieces written for this combination are elementary in nature; many more are arrangements of pieces for other forces.

'''''Rumiyah''''' ({{lang-ar|رومية|Rome}}) was an [[online magazine]] used by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL) for propaganda and recruitment. It was first published in September 2016 and is released in several languages, including English, French, German, Russian, Indonesian and Uyghur.&lt;ref name="adnani"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/in-new-english-magazine-rumiyah-is-calls-for-lone-wolf-attacks-in-australia-west.html|title=In New Magazine 'Rumiyah,' IS Calls for Lone-Wolf Attacks in Australia, West|last=SITE|website=news.siteintelgroup.com|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-propaganda-terror-group-losses-syria-iraq-a7228286.html |author=Bethan McKernan|title=Isis' new magazine Rumiyah shows the terror group is 'struggling to adjust to losses' |publisher=''The Independent''|date=2016-09-06|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine replaces ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'', ''[[Dar al-Islam (magazine)|Dar al-Islam]]'' and other magazines that were released until mid-2016. Analysts attributed the change of name partly to the imminent loss of [[2016 Dabiq offensive|the town of Dabiq]] to a Turkish-led military offensive, which occurred in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/12/12/after-the-islamic-state|author=Robin Wright|title=After the Islamic State|publisher=''The New Yorker''|date=2016-12-02|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dabiqfall"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/10/town-of-dabiq-falls-to-turkish-backed-forces.php|title=Town of Dabiq falls to Turkish-backed forces|publisher=''The long War Journal''|date=2016-10-17|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-islamic-state-children-iraq-syria-western-targets-a7485316.html |author=Kim Sengupta|title=Isis indoctrinating children to plan attacks on Big Ben, Eiffel Tower and Statue of Liberty

|publisher=''Institute for the Study of War''|access-date=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Rumiyah'' (Rome) is a reference to a [[hadith]] in which [[Muhammed]] said that Muslims would conquer both [[Constantinople]] and [[Rome]] in that order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/09/08/an-isis-plot-to-blow-up-notre-dame-cathedral-and-rule-the-world.html|title=An ISIS Plot to Blow Up Notre Dame Cathedral—and Rule the World?
|access-date=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WrightState"/&gt;

Like ''Dabiq'', each issue opens with a quote attributed to [[Abu Hamza al Muhajir]]: "O muwahhidin, rejoice, for by Allah, we will not rest from our jihad except beneath the olive trees of Rumiyah (Rome)."&lt;ref name="dabiqfall"/&gt;

The first issue was released after the death of ISIL's spokesman, [[Abu Mohammad al-Adnani]], who was featured heavily in the magazine.&lt;ref name="adnani"/&gt; In October 2016, Islamic State released the second edition of the magazine in which it justified attacks against non-Muslims, including detailed descriptions of how to carry out knife attacks on smaller groups of people.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In October 2016, ''Rumiyah'' advised followers to carry out [[stabbing as a terrorist tactic|stabbing attacks]] and argued that jihadists throughout Muslim history have "struck the necks of the [[kuffar]]" (unbelievers) in the name of [[Allah]] with "swords, severing limbs and piercing the fleshy meat of those who opposed Islam". The magazine advised its readers that knives are easy to obtain and to hide and that they make good, deadly weapons where Muslims might be regarded with suspicion.&lt;ref name="WrightState"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wright|first1=Robin|title=The Hand of ISIS at Ohio State|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-hand-of-isis-at-ohio-state|accessdate=4 April 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No Thumbtacks.jpg|thumb|300px]]'''Self-referential humor''', also known as '''self-reflexive humor''' or '''meta humor''', is a type of [[Expression (language)|comedic expression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/phahn/humor/self_ref.htm |title=Sentences about Self-Reference and Recurrence |publisher=.vo.lu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that—either directed toward some other subject, or openly directed toward itself—intentionally [[allude]]s to the very person who is expressing the [[humor]] in a comedic fashion, or to some specific aspect of that same comedic expression.  Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and [[surreal humor|surrealistically]] is a form of [[bathos]]. In general, self-referential humor often uses [[hypocrisy]], [[oxymoron]], or [[paradox]] to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Self referential humor]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Self-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the [[fourth wall]] to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.

[[Old Comedy]] of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. [[Aristophanes]], whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hughes; ''Performing Greek Comedy'' (Cambridge, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{main|Self referential humor|selfref=yes}} &lt;!--&lt;&lt;&lt; If you are tempted to remove this, then see  https://en.wikipedia.org/?oldid=830118246#see_also_link  --&gt;

[[RAS syndrome]] refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an [[acronym]] or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. However, "RAS" stands for '''R'''edundant '''A'''cronym '''S'''yndrome; therefore, the full phrase yields "Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome" and is self-referencing in a comical manner.  It also reflects an excessive use of [[Three-letter acronym|TLA]]s ('''T'''hree '''L'''etter '''A'''cronyms).

[[Meta]] has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential. Popularised by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] who wrote several books on himself and the subject of self-reference, [[meta-joke]]s are a popular form of humor.

'''''Soarin{{'}}''''', also known as '''''Soarin' Around the World''''' and '''''Soaring Over the Horizon''''', is a [[flight]] [[simulator|motion simulator]] attraction at [[Disney California Adventure]], [[Epcot]], and [[Shanghai Disneyland]]. The ride employs a mechanical lift system, a 
projected presentation on an {{convert|80|ft|m|abbr=on}} concave 180-degree dome screen, artificial scents and wind to simulate a [[hang gliding]] [[flight]] over several locations across six continents around the world.&lt;ref name="rebooted"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OCShanghai/&gt;

The original iteration of the attraction, known as '''''Soarin{{'}} Over California''''', was an opening day attraction at Disney California Adventure on February 8, 2001. The initial version took guests over several locations in [[California]], and included a pre-show tribute to the history of California's aviation industry. Due to its consistent popularity, ''Soarin{{'}} Over California'' was duplicated at Epcot in [[Walt Disney World]] as ''Soarin{{'}}'' in 2005.

The current global version of the ride debuted at [[Shanghai Disneyland Park]] as ''Soaring Over the Horizon'' on June 16, 2016. Concurrently, the American versions were also replaced with the new film as ''Soarin{{'}} Around the World'' on the next day, June 17.&lt;ref name="Soarin' Around the World Opening Day"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Victoria|title=Soarin’ Around the World Takes Flight at Disney Parks This Summer|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/04/soarin-around-the-world-takes-flight-at-disney-parks-this-summer/|website=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=20 April 2016|language=en-us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910165841/https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/04/soarin-around-the-world-takes-flight-at-disney-parks-this-summer/|archivedate=September 10, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glover"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glover|first1=Erin|title=''Soarin’ Around the World'' Coming to Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resorts|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/08/soarin-around-the-world-coming-to-walt-disney-world-and-disneyland-resorts/|website=DisneyParks Blog|publisher=Disney|accessdate=29 February 2016|date=16 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225164706/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/08/soarin-around-the-world-coming-to-walt-disney-world-and-disneyland-resorts/|archivedate=February 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth attraction was announced in 2016 for [[Tokyo DisneySea]], and is expected to open in 2019.&lt;ref name="Soarin-TDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/04/27/beauty-and-the-beast-themed-land-big-hero-6-attraction-announced-for-tokyo-disneyland/|title=BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-THEMED LAND, BIG HERO 6 ATTRACTION ANNOUNCED FOR TOKYO DISNEYLAND|author=Drew Taylor|work=ohmy.disney.com|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|date=27 April 2016|accessdate=27 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603183359/https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/04/27/beauty-and-the-beast-themed-land-big-hero-6-attraction-announced-for-tokyo-disneyland/|archivedate=June 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ride design==
[[File:Soarin over California - Disney California Adventure Park.jpg|thumb|left|Three rows of seating for the ride]]
''Soarin{{'}}'' was first conceptualized in 1996 as "Ultra Flight," a name which can still be seen on the tower consoles of the California Adventure attraction. It was to feature an [[OMNIMAX]] screen with an inverted track allowing guests to fly over California's landmarks. The attraction would have three load levels and the system would operate on a horizontal cable, much like a dry cleaner's rack. This plan was abandoned, however, when it was determined that the construction and labor costs for that design would be prohibitive. It seemed that ''Soarin{{'}}'' wouldn't become a reality until engineer Mark Sumner developed a different idea for the ride vehicles, using an [[Erector Set]] and string to create a working model.  This design would allow Disney to efficiently load guests on one level instead of three, thus cutting construction and labor costs greatly.

Each ride vehicle consists of three rows of seats under a wing-like canopy, and has a capacity of 87 guests at a time. After guests have been safely restrained in the vehicle using standard lap belts, the canopy descends slightly and a [[cantilever]] system lifts the chairs forward and into the air with the guests' feet dangling freely. The vehicle is lifted forward so that guests look into a large, concave movie screen onto which aerial views are projected.  The scenes for the original film were shot with an [[IMAX HD]] frame rate - 48 frames per second, twice the conventional output for regular films.  Since the vehicle is moved forward toward the center of the dome, guests can only see the images projected on the screen and experience the sensation of flight.  The ride structure contains about one million pounds (454,000&amp;nbsp;kg) of steel, and 37 tons (33.5 metric tonnes) are lifted during each ride cycle.

To enhance the illusion of flight, subtle vertical movements of the seats are synchronized to the film. Sensations of horizontal motion are created using a combination of vertical carriage movement and turning the image on the screen. In addition, scents complementing the various scenes are injected into the air streams blowing on riders. These scents now include rose blossoms in the Taj Mahal scene, the aroma of grass in the Africa scene, and a sea breeze scent in the South Pacific scene in the updated show.&lt;ref name="rebooted"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/themeparks/la-tr-soarin-around-the-world-disney-20160622-snap-story.html|title=Disney’s rebooted Soarin’ ride takes flight over worldwide landmarks|first=Brady|last=MacDonald|work=Los Angeles Times|date=22 June 2016|accessdate=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725212604/http://www.latimes.com/travel/themeparks/la-tr-soarin-around-the-world-disney-20160622-snap-story.html|archivedate=July 25, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/06/25/soarin-around-the-world-questions/|title=All Of Your Soarin’ Around the World Questions, Answered|date=25 June 2016|work=Oh My Disney|publisher=disney.com|accessdate=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160822151001/https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/06/25/soarin-around-the-world-questions/|archivedate=August 22, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==

=== Disney California Adventure ===
[[File:Soarin Over California Updated Entrance - July 17th 2015.JPG|thumb|right|''Soarin{{'}} Over California'' at Disney California Adventure.]]
''Soarin{{'}} Around the World'' is located in the Grizzly Peak Airfield section of [[Disney California Adventure]] at the [[Disneyland Resort]]. It is one of the most popular attractions in the resort and usually has wait times ranging from 30 to 150 minutes. However, the attraction is tied into the park's [[FASTPASS]] system, allowing guests the option of bypassing a long wait.

While waiting in line, guests pass the Wings of Fame, an homage to significant aircraft in the history of aviation in California. Some of these include the [[P-51 Mustang]], [[SR-71 Blackbird]], and the [[Bell X-1]]. There is also a section dedicated to individuals such as [[John J. Montgomery]], [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Jimmy Doolittle]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], [[Jack Northrop]], the [[Wright brothers]], [[Howard Hughes]], [[Jacqueline Cochran]], [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]], [[Paul MacCready]], and [[Chuck Yeager]]. Inspirational music from a variety of films, many of them war- or flight-themed, is played in the queue hallways.  Some film scores featured include ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', ''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'', ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'', ''[[The Blue Max]]'', ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]'', (all by [[Jerry Goldsmith]]), ''[[The American President]]'' (by [[Marc Shaiman]]), ''[[DragonHeart#Music and sound|DragonHeart]]'', ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]'' (both by [[Randy Edelman]]),  ''[[The Last Starfighter]]'' (by [[Craig Safan]]), ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' and ''[[The Rocketeer]]'' (both by [[James Horner]]), ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'' (by [[John Williams]]) and the [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'' (by [[Michael Kamen]]). ''The Air Force Song'' and "Jupiter" from [[Gustav Holst]]'s orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'' are also included, based on their use in ''[[The Right Stuff (film)|The Right Stuff]]''.

Before entering the theater area, guests are placed in one of three preshow areas, called "Alpha Gate", "Bravo Gate", or "Charlie Gate," (named for the first three letters of the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]). Just before boarding, guests watch a pre-boarding video hosted by their chief flight attendant, Patrick, portrayed by actor [[Patrick Warburton]].&lt;ref name="rebooted" /&gt;

The attraction opened in 2001 as ''Soarin{{'}} Over California'' in what was then the Condor Flats area of the park. In early 2015, the attraction closed for refurbishment as the surrounding area was transformed into Grizzly Peak Airfield. It reopened on May 15, 2015, with new exterior theming and with updates to its screen and projection system.&lt;ref name="pimentel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/disney-648380-disneyland-california.html|last1=Pimentel|first1=Joseph|title=Upgrades close several Disney rides|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=January 25, 2015|page=Local 2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308230808/http://www.ocregister.com/articles/disney-648380-disneyland-california.html|archivedate=March 8, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disney-california-adventure/soarin-over-california/|title=Soarin' Over California|work=Disneyland|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113025618/https://disneyland.disney.go.com/attractions/disney-california-adventure/soarin-over-california/|archivedate=January 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Erin|title=New Smokejumpers Grill Opens March 20, Part of Grizzly Peak Expansion at Disney California Adventure Park|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/03/new-smokejumpers-grill-opens-march-20-part-of-grizzly-peak-expansion-at-disney-california-adventure-park/|publisher=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=March 11, 2015|date=March 9, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311145348/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/03/new-smokejumpers-grill-opens-march-20-part-of-grizzly-peak-expansion-at-disney-california-adventure-park/|archivedate=March 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glover|first=Erin|title=Grizzly Peak Airfield Now Open at Disney California Adventure Park|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/05/grizzly-peak-airfield-now-open-at-disney-california-adventure-park/|publisher=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=May 15, 2015|date=May 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516201649/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/05/grizzly-peak-airfield-now-open-at-disney-california-adventure-park/|archivedate=May 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attraction now features the a Laser Illuminated digital projection array which replaces the original Imax systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/area-662361-scholz-disney.html|title=New Grizzly Peak Airfield at Disney California Adventure recalls scenic national parks|accessdate=July 12, 2015|authors=Mark Eades, OC Register|quote=According to Scholz, advances in laser illumination technology allowed Disney to upgrade the projectors without a sacrifice in the quality of the show.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713031616/http://www.ocregister.com/articles/area-662361-scholz-disney.html|archivedate=July 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the projection system changes, several exterior changes occurred, including a replacement of the mock-up [[RS-25]] rocket engine with a [[fire lookout tower]].

From January to March 2016, the attraction operated as ''Soarin{{'}} Over California'' intermittently in order to prepare for the introduction of the ''Soarin{{'}} Around the World'' ride film. The original film was shown until June 15, with the attraction being closed on June 16 to prepare for the new film debuting on June 17, 2016.&lt;ref name="Around the World Opening"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glover|first1=Erin|title=Taking Flight from Grizzly Peak Airfield on Soarin’ Around the World at Disney California Adventure Park|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/05/taking-flight-from-grizzly-peak-airfield-on-soarin-around-the-world-at-disney-california-adventure-park/|website=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=23 May 2016|language=en-us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605063637/https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/05/taking-flight-from-grizzly-peak-airfield-on-soarin-around-the-world-at-disney-california-adventure-park/|archivedate=June 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epcot===
[[File:Soarin' around the world.jpg|thumb|Entrance for Epcot's ''Soarin{{'}}'' within The Land pavilion.]]
The attraction was duplicated, simply as ''Soarin{{'}}'', and officially opened inside "[[The Land (Epcot)|The Land]]" pavilion at [[Epcot]] in [[Walt Disney World]] on May 5, 2005. Unlike the Disney California Adventure version, the idea is that guests are taking flights ''to'' California, rather than already being there. This is further reinforced in the theming that you are loaded into "gates" and with airport-themed spiels which reference "Flight 5505", which is a homage to the opening day of the attraction. Its cast members wear costumes that resemble flight attendant costumes, whereas the California version uses airfield crew costumes.

The Epcot standby queue originally featured pictures of natural wonders from around the world, not just California. There was very little reference to the fact that the ride only featured California at the time. The queue currently utilizes a new infrared technology that allows guests to participate in interactive games. In 2009, this interactive game technology appeared in the [[Magic Kingdom]] as part of a seven-month overhaul of [[Space Mountain (Magic Kingdom)|Space Mountain]].

The attraction closed for refurbishment on January 4, 2016, originally slated to reopen on June 17, with a third theater to coincide with the release of the new ''Soarin{{'}} Around the World'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/03/more-opportunities-to-soar-enjoy-toy-story-mania-coming-to-walt-disney-world-resort/|title=More Opportunities to Soar, Enjoy Toy Story Mania Coming to Walt Disney World Resort|accessdate=July 12, 2015|authors=Thomas Smith, Social Media Director, Disney Parks|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713040145/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/03/more-opportunities-to-soar-enjoy-toy-story-mania-coming-to-walt-disney-world-resort/|archivedate=July 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://behindthethrills.com/2015/08/d23-soarin-around-the-world-coming-to-both-epcot-and-disneys-california-adventure/|title=D23: Soarin Around the World coming to both Epcot and Disney’s California Adventure!|accessdate=August 15, 2015|author=Erik|website= Behind the Thrills|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817123357/http://behindthethrills.com/2015/08/d23-soarin-around-the-world-coming-to-both-epcot-and-disneys-california-adventure/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ride reopened with the original film on May 27, with the change to the new film occurring on June 17, 2016.&lt;ref name="Around the World Opening"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Victoria|title=Last Chance to Experience the Classic Soarin’ at Epcot and Disney California Adventure Before Soarin’ Around the World Debuts on June 17|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/05/last-chance-to-experience-the-classic-soarin-at-epcot-and-disney-california-adventure-before-soarin-around-the-world-debuts-on-june-17/|website=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=23 May 2016|language=en-us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160521142239/https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/05/last-chance-to-experience-the-classic-soarin-at-epcot-and-disney-california-adventure-before-soarin-around-the-world-debuts-on-june-17/|archivedate=May 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bevil|first1=Dewayne|title=Disney: Opening dates for Frozen ride, Soarin', Star Wars fireworks, more|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/theme-park-rangers-blog/os-disney-epcot-frozen-ride-open-20160520-story.html|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|accessdate=23 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523091815/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/theme-park-rangers-blog/os-disney-epcot-frozen-ride-open-20160520-story.html|archivedate=May 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shanghai Disneyland Park ===
The attraction was retooled as ''Soaring Over the Horizon'' for [[Shanghai Disneyland Park]]. The attraction was not part of the park's original design plans, and was added only after [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] began development on it for the American parks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Makinen|first1=Julie|title=Disney's popular 'Soaring' ride gets a Shanghai reboot|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-shanghai-disney-soaring-1465963845-htmlstory.html|accessdate=August 22, 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 17, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820155522/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-shanghai-disney-soaring-1465963845-htmlstory.html|archivedate=August 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in the Adventure Isle section, the ride opened with the park on June 16, 2016.

Embedded into the Adventure Isle setting, the attraction is depicted here as an ancient observatory and temple to the Arbori tribe's Condor god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soaring Over the Horizon {{!}} Shanghai Disney Resort|url=https://www.shanghaidisneyresort.com/en/attractions/soaring-over-horizon/|website=www.shanghaidisneyresort.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preshow and safety spiel is hosted by a shaman of the tribe who grants you the ability of flight, but has trouble controlling her own shapeshifting abilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= June 20, 2016|title= SHDL  Soaring Over the Horizon(Preshow)　ソアリン　オーバー・ザ・ホライズン（プレショー）|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6xwm7gmBt8 |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= YouTube|time= |location= |publisher= rogermosphere|id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tokyo DisneySea===
[[File:Soarin-TokyoSea.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Artist's concept of Tokyo DisneySea version of ''Soarin{{'}}'']]
On April 27, 2016, officials with [[Tokyo Disney Resort]] announced a number of new attractions for both [[Tokyo Disneyland]] and [[Tokyo DisneySea]] parks in the coming years.&lt;ref name="Soarin-TDS"/&gt; Included in the announcement was a proposed version of ''Soarin{{'}}'' to be located in the Mediterranean Harbor section of Tokyo DisneySea.&lt;ref name="Soarin-TDS"/&gt; The announcement revealed that this version will have a different theme, with the ride vehicles resembling [[Renaissance|Renaissance-era]] flying machines envisioned by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and that it was planned to open during the 2019 fiscal year for the resort.&lt;ref name="Soarin-TDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rebooted" /&gt;

===''Soarin{{'}} Over California''===
[[File:Soarin' Over California.JPG|thumb|right|''Soarin{{'}} Over California'' exterior as it appeared from 2001-2014 at Disney California Adventure.]]
The original ride film, which lasted about four minutes and 51 seconds, took guests on a simulated hang glider tour of California. Appropriate scents (citrus, pine, sagebrush, ocean mist) filled the air as the ride vehicles themselves moved gently to simulate the sensations of flight. In addition to the state's various landscapes, the ride also highlighted its diverse recreation, including [[snow skiing]], river [[rafting]], [[kayaking]], [[golf]], [[horseback riding]], [[hot air ballooning]], [[surfing]] and of course, [[hang gliding]]. The locations visited were: 
* [[Golden Gate Bridge]] in [[San Francisco]]
* [[Redwood Creek (Humboldt County)|Redwood Creek]] in [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]]
* [[Napa Valley]]
* [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay Sanctuary]]
* [[Lake Tahoe]]
* [[Yosemite Falls]] and [[Half Dome]] in [[Yosemite National Park]] 
* [[PGA West Stadium Course|PGA West Palmer Course]] in [[La Quinta, California|La Quinta]] (credited in the queue as [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]])
* [[Camarillo]]

* [[Downtown Los Angeles|Downtown]] [[Los Angeles]]
* [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]]

The original ''Soarin{{'}} Over California'' ride film at both Disney California Adventure and Epcot used an orchestral score by composer [[Jerry Goldsmith]], who is said to have come down from his first ride in tears. In addition to finding the ride visually beautiful and magical, he said that his father was a pilot who loved all things Californian. "I'd do anything to be part of this project," Goldsmith said. "I'd even score the film for free."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID115170.asp |title=The new Disney California Adventure Official Album |accessdate=September 9, 2009 |author=Jim Hill Media |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010143938/http://www.laughingplace.com/News-ID115170.asp |archivedate=October 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack he wrote played throughout the entire attraction, starting with a crescendo in the low [[String instrument|strings]] while the screen was still dark. Numerous variations of a serene theme for [[French horn|horn]] and strings could be heard, as well as several statements of a fanfare that accompanied the film's grandest vistas. The entire original ride score can be found on recent [[Disneyland Resort]] and Walt Disney World official albums, including ''[[Walt Disney Records: The Legacy Collection#Disneyland|Walt Disney Records The Legacy Collection: Disneyland]]''. The original score also continues to be played as part of a loop in the Disneyland Resort Esplanade and Epcot's entrance plaza.

===''Soaring Over the Horizon'' and ''Soarin{{'}} Around the World''===

==History==
[[File:Lompat Batu Nias.jpg|thumb|right|Nias' "leaping the stones" ritual.]]
In traditional [[Indonesian culture]], there is no actual concept for physical exercise as the counterpart of modern [[sport]]. [[Native Indonesian]]s usually linked the physical activities to tribal practices; mainly for ritual, art, physical fitness and martial purposes. The war dances and ritual combat among Indonesian tribes are the earliest example of ritualised physical exercise in Indonesia. Some of native Indonesian rituals are resembling sport, such as ''lompat batu'' (leaping the stone) tradition among [[Nias]] male youth as part of coming of age ritual, that resembles [[hurdling]] and [[long jump]] in athletics. Also [[Madurese people|Madurese]] ''[[karapan sapi]]'' and [[Minangkabau people|Minang]] ''[[pacu jawi]]'' (bull racing) that are similar to [[chariot race]]. [[Dragon boat]], [[canoe]] and [[kayak]] race are virtually everyday activities among Indonesians that lives on the bank of major rivers or on distant islands.

In the 9th century the images of [[archery]], described as princely court activities among nobility in ancient Java, can be found on bas-reliefs of Javanese [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]s. Archery is suggested as one of Indonesia's classical sport, and one of its famous rendering came from [[Prambanan]] temple as part of Ramayana story and later rendered as one of the icon of the Jakarta's [[1962 Asian Games]], also as the symbol of [[Gelora Bung Karno Stadium]].

[[Pencak Silat]] is the example of Indonesian native [[martial art]] that turned into competitive combat sport. Several [[Indonesian dance]]s demonstrated repetitive movements that similar to physical exercise. Indonesian traditional social dances such as ''poco-poco'' dance from North Sulawesi and ''sajojo'' from Papua are adopted as ''senam kesegaran jasmani'' (musical [[calisthenics]]) today popular across Indonesia.

The modern concept of sport was introduced during colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] period. During these times [[association football|football]] and [[badminton]] has reached Indonesia and become popular sport among Indonesian people ever since. After Indonesian independence, [[National Sports Committee of Indonesia]] was established in 1946 to unite the various satellite sports associations that was created within the regencies, then sports facilities were constructed in Indonesia, such as [[Ikada Stadium]] (1951—1962). During [[Sukarno]] reign, there is a desire to utilise sport as the means for uniting Indonesian people, establishing national pride as well as promoting sports in Indonesia. As the result the [[Gelora Bung Karno Stadium]] surrounded by sporting complex facilities were constructed in 1962 to host the [[1962 Asian Games|fourth Asian Games]] held in Jakarta. Today in international stage, Indonesia is successful in badminton and also has been one of the major multi-event sports powerhouse in Southeast Asia.

== Plot ==
The plot follows the characters of ''The Boys in the Band,'' revisiting them 35 years later. The group is brought back together at the funeral of Larry, who died of [[pancreatic cancer]]. They revisit the same apartment in [[Manhattan]] as the first play, and again begin talking and arguing. The dialog and story is relayed in "real time." New characters include Scott, a younger man dating Michael, who is poorly received by the group. Michael angrily defends Scott, and yells at the new character Jason, a "strident young activist" who had been romantically involved with Larry. Emory and Harold get involved in the arguments, while non-combative characters include Donald, Bernard, and Rick, a male nurse who had been harboring feelings for Larry.&lt;ref name="VARIETY"/&gt; Among other details, three of the characters have joined [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].&lt;ref name="NEWYORK"&gt;{{cite news

==Creation==
The play was written by [[Mart Crowley]], famous for writing ''[[The Boys in the Band (play)|The Boys in the Band]]'', which was groundbreaking for its frank portrayal of gay perspectives and lives in a repressive time, prior to the cultural acceptance of gay rights&lt;ref name="PLAYBILL"/&gt; later in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="NEWYORK"/&gt; Crowley stated that he had always declined recommendations to write a sequel, until he felt enough time passed where he knew what had likely happened to the characters.&lt;ref name="PLAYBILL"/&gt; It was his first play since ''Avec Schmaltz'' in 1984.&lt;ref name="PLAYBILL"/&gt; The original score was composed by [[Larry Grossman (composer)|Larry Grossman]], known for ''[[A Doll's Life]]''.&lt;ref name="PLAYBILL"/&gt;

==Productions==
Its world premiere was on October 26, 2002 at [[San Francisco]]'s New Conservatory Theater Center, under artistic direction by Ed Decker. It was billed as a "sequel play." Actors included:&lt;ref name="VARIETY"/&gt; 
*[[Russ Duffy]] as Michael
*[[Olen Christian Holm]] as Scott, a "pretty boy" dating Michael
*[[Owen Thomas (actor)|Owen Thomas]] as Jason, a young activist
*[[Michael Patrick Gaffney]] as Emory

==Reception==

About the 2002 premiere, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that a "lack of significant change" in the characters' demeanor was one of several major problems in the play, wondering why Michael, Harold, Emory, and the other character had remained friends despite their years of backstabbing. Dennis Harvey of ''Variety'' complained that the characters seemed to have "resisted 35 years of social potential personal change," and that they remained single, "predatory," and ill-suited for long-term relationships. It also criticized what it perceived as the use of characters as "authorial mouthpieces" for outdated and racist sentiments. Decker's production was also criticized for its staging and "ill-conceived" apartment set. It praised Duffy for the best acting, with Michael portrayed as "poisonous yet occasionally poignant."&lt;ref name="VARIETY"&gt;{{cite news

'''''The Second Little Show''''' is a musical [[revue]] with lyrics by [[Howard Dietz]] and music mostly by [[Arthur Schwartz]].

Produced by William A. Brady, Jr. and [[Dwight Deere Wiman]], in association with Tom Weatherly, the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened at the [[Royale Theatre]] on September 2, 1930 and closed in October 1930, after 63 performances. Directed by Wiman and [[Monty Woolley]] and choreographed by Dave Gould, with scenic design by [[Jo Mielziner]], the cast included [[Jay C. Flippen]], Gloria Grafton, and Al Trahan.

This is the second of the ''Little Shows''.  The only claim to fame is the song "Sing Something Simple" with words and music by Herman Hupfield, introduced by [[Ruth tester]].&lt;ref&gt;Jasen David A., ''Tin Pan Alley'' (2003), Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|0-415-93877-5}} , p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;
Other songs include "I Like Your Face" (originally "Foolish Face"), "Lucky Seven", "What a Case I've Got On You", and "You're the Sunrise".

The producers of [[The Little Show]], in doing the follow-up, decided to do the show without stars, but the show did poorly. (And the stars of the first ''Little Show'' went on to success.)&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, Steven, ''Show tunes'' (2000), Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|0-19-512599-1}}, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a ''Third Little Show'', which opened at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on June 1, 1931 and ran for 136 performances. The music was by various composers (including Hupfield) and the sketches were by [[Noël Coward]], [[S. J. Perelman]], [[Marc Connelly]], among others.  It was directed by Alexander Leftwich and starred [[Beatrice Lillie]], [[Ernest Truex]], and [[Constance Carpenter]]. Lillie introduced the Coward song "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" to the American audience in this revue.&lt;ref&gt;Suskin, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=11377 ''Third Little Show''] ibdb.com, accessed August 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Top Hat Willy''' is a platform [[Personal computer game|computer game]] created by Tero Heikkinen for the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]] and was released in 1994. The objective of the game is to collect 160 pieces of trash that are scattered around the 100 room gameplay area. The rooms are set up in a 10 × 10 grid, each room connecting to its four surrounding rooms. The player has 9 lives.
The game is based on the ZX Spectrum game ''[[Jet Set Willy]]''.

==Plot==
Willy arrives at his mansion after a party and has to pick up all of the pieces of trash.

==Gameplay==
''Top Hat Willy'' is similar to ''Jet Set Willy''. It has three controls: left, right and jump. Willy can climb stairs by jumping onto them (walking through them to avoid them). The play area itself consists of 100 rooms containing patrolling monsters, various platforms and 160 collectable objects. The collectable items glow to distinguish them from other items in the room.

'''1&amp;nbsp;inch Type C''' (designated Type C by [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers|SMPTE]]) is a professional [[reel-to-reel]] [[analog recording]] [[helical scan]] [[videotape]] format co-developed and introduced by [[Ampex]] and [[Sony]] in 1976. It became the replacement in the professional [[video]] and [[broadcast television]] industries for the then-incumbent 2&amp;nbsp;inch [[quadruplex videotape]] (2&amp;nbsp;inch Quad for short) open-reel format, due to the smaller size, comparative ease of operation (vs. 2&amp;nbsp;inch) and slightly higher [[video]] quality of 1&amp;nbsp;inch type C [[video tape recorder]] (VTR).  1&amp;nbsp;inch type C required less maintenance downtime than [[quadruplex videotape]], and did not require [[time base correction]] to produce a stable video signal.

1&amp;nbsp;inch Type C is capable of "trick-play" functions such as still, shuttle, and variable-speed playback, including [[slow motion]]. 2&amp;nbsp;inch quadruplex videotape machines lacked these capabilities, due to the segmented manner in which it recorded video [[Recording head|tracks]] onto the [[magnetic tape]].  Also, 1&amp;nbsp;inch Type C VTRs required much less maintenance (and used less power and space) than did 2&amp;nbsp;inch machines.

1&amp;nbsp;inch Type C records [[composite video]] at a very high video quality that is superior to contemporary color-under formats such as [[U-matic]], and of comparable quality to analog [[component video]] formats like [[Betacam]] and [[MII (videocassette format)|MII]].  Both analog component formats were notoriously fussy and trouble-prone, so in practice Type C gave a stable, more reliable picture than the broadcast quality analog cassette-based videotape formats. Because television was broadcast as a composite signal, there was no real downside to Type C in television broadcasting and distribution.

1 inch tape gained numerous uses in television production including outside broadcasts where it was used for instant replays and creating programme titles. 1 inch machines were considerable smaller and more reliable than preceding two inch versions and were seen by operators as a major technological breakthrough. Due to this smaller size, it was possible for OB crews to transport and use multiple machines, allowing for much more complex editing to be done on site for use within the programme.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, John; Hall, Nick (2017): ADAPT. figshare. Collection.https://doi.org/10.17637/rh.c.3925603.v1&lt;/ref&gt;. The quality and reliability of 1&amp;nbsp;inch Type C made it a mainstay in television and [[video production]] in [[television studio]]s for almost 20 years, before being supplanted by more reliable digital [[videocassette]] formats like [[DVCAM]], [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]], [[D-2 (video)|D-2]], and [[DVCPro#DVCPRO|DVCPro]].  1&amp;nbsp;inch Type C was also widely used for the mastering of early [[LaserDisc]] titles. It was replaced in that role by the digital [[D-2 (video)|D-2]] videocassette format in the late 1980s.

The '''Verden Magic Park''' ({{lang-de|Magic Park Verden}}) is an amusement park in [[Verden (Aller)]] in North Germany, which lies on the [[Bundesautobahn 27|A 27 motorway]] between [[Hanover]] and [[Bremen]]. The park describes itself as "Germany's only amusement park for magic!". Accordingly, it has specialised in the areas of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[fairy tales]]. It is also a stop on the  [[German Fairy Tale Route]].
&lt;!--
== Namensänderung ==
Ursprünglich trug der Park den Namen Freizeitpark Verden. Im Februar 2002 drohte die [[Insolvenzrecht|Insolvenz]]. Der [[Serengeti-Park]] [[Hodenhagen]] und sein Geschäftsführer Giovanni Sepe übernahmen den Park und starteten einen Neuanfang mit neuem Namen und neuem Konzept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bikonline.de/journa/vn8.html Bericht über die Namensänderung in den ''Verdener Nachrichten'' vom 16. Februar 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many video game companies are beginning to invest, and India could become an important market for this sector.&lt;ref name="BG33"/&gt;

The Indian gaming market is very varied. While there are a section of hardcore gamers, there are still many gamers playing cartridge games on TV and handheld devices. This has led to the proliferation of pirated, second hand and knock offs to meet the needs of a diverse range of consumers with different access to money and information.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal |last1= Deka|first1= Maitrayee|last2= |first2= |date= 2016|title= Bazaars and Video Games in India|url= http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0974927616668005?journalCode=bioa|journal= BioScope: South Asian Screen Studies|volume= 7|issue= 2|pages= |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With a piracy rate of software and consoles of over 80% and a penetration rate of [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] still low, India's video game market has long lagged behind the rest of World, publishers and distributors of video games struggling to find their place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/opinion/gaming-is-a-niche-in-india-because-game-retail-is-broken-754521|title=Gaming Is a Niche in India Because Game Retail Is Broken|website=Gadgets.ndtv.com|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This delay is also explained by the fact that the country has traditionally never had a real culture of gaming. However, this situation is changing due to the increase in the average income of Indians and the increase in Interest in [[Internet]] and entertainment.&lt;ref name="BG33"/&gt;

Like China and South Korea, India is experiencing strong growth in online gaming. With between 35 and 50 million Internet users, the country is attracting interest from the online video game industry, which is difficult to hack. In October 2005, [[Level Up! Games]] was the first to distribute a [[massively multiplayer online game]] in India with "[[Ragnarok Online]]" and was soon followed by others Companies like Syfy with the game '' [[A3 (video game)|A3]] ''. The latter are South Korean games whose content has been adapted in order to please the people of the country. However, these games were only modestly successful, with about 10000 in 2006. As investments continue to rise, however, the video game market is expected to grow rapidly in India.&lt;ref name = "BG33 "&gt;{{Harvsp | Stang | Osterholt | Hoftun | 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the factors driving the growth of the video game market is its large number of [[cybercafé]]s with more than 100,000 in 2006, 40% of which are used to play online. Video games play a crucial role in their development by attracting and [[Customer retention|retaining customers]] and, conversely, cybercafes contribute to the promotion of video games.

'''Vocal pedagogy''' is the study of the art and science of [[voice]] instruction. It is used in the teaching of [[singing]] and assists in defining what singing is, how singing works, and how proper '''singing technique''' is accomplished.

Vocal pedagogy covers a broad range of aspects of singing, ranging from the physiological process of vocal production to the artistic aspects of interpretation of songs from different genres or historical eras. Typical areas of study include:&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book

:
* [[Human anatomy]] and [[Human physiology|physiology]] as it relates to the physical process of singing.
* Breathing and air support for singing
* [[Human position|Posture]] for singing
* [[Phonation]]
* [[Vocal resonation]] or [[voice projection]]
* Diction, vowels and articulation
* [[Vocal registration]]
* [[Sostenuto]] and [[legato]] for singing
* Other singing elements, such as range extension, tone quality, [[vibrato]], [[coloratura]]
* Vocal health and [[voice disorders]] related to singing
* Vocal styles, such as learning to sing [[opera]], [[belt (music)|belt]], or [[Art song]]
* [[Phonetics]]
* [[Voice classification]]

All of these different concepts are a part of developing proper '''vocal technique'''. Not all vocal teachers have the same opinions within every topic of study which causes variations in pedagogical approaches and vocal technique.

==History==
[[File:Sanzio 01 Pythagoras.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pythagoras]], the man in the center with the book, teaching music, in [[The School of Athens]] by [[Raphael]]]]
Within Western culture, the study of vocal pedagogy began in [[Ancient Greece]]. Scholars such as [[Alypius (music writer)|Alypius]] and [[Pythagoras]] studied and made observations on the art of singing. It is unclear, however, whether the Greeks ever developed a systematic approach to teaching singing as little writing on the subject survives today.&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians]]''. Edited by [[Stanley Sadie]], ''Volume 6. Edmund to Fryklund''. {{ISBN|1-56159-174-2}}, Copyright Macmillan 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first surviving record of a systematized approach to teaching singing was developed in the [[medieval]] [[monasteries]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] sometime near the beginning of the 13th century. As with other fields of study, the monasteries were the center of musical intellectual life during the medieval period and many men within the monasteries devoted their time to the study of music and the art of singing. Highly influential in the development of a vocal pedagogical system were monks [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]] who were the first to develop a concept of [[vocal registers]]. These men identified three registers: [[chest voice]], [[throat voice]], and [[head voice]] (pectoris, guttoris, and capitis). Their concept of head voice, however, is much more similar to the modern pedagogists understanding of the [[falsetto register]]. Other concepts discussed in the monastic system included [[vocal resonance]], [[voice classification]], breath support, diction, and tone quality to name a few. The ideas developed within the monastic system highly influenced the development of vocal pedagogy over the next several centuries including the [[Bel canto|Bel Canto]] style of singing.&lt;ref name="groveONE"/&gt;

With the onset of the [[Renaissance]] in the 15th century, the study of singing began to move outside of the church. The courts of rich patrons, such as the Dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] who supported the [[Burgundian School]] and the [[Franco-Flemish School]], became secular centers of study for singing and all other areas of musical study. The vocal pedagogical methods taught in these schools, however, were based on the concepts developed within the monastic system. Many of the teachers within these schools had their initial musical training from singing in church choirs as children. The church also remained at the forefront of musical composition at this time and remained highly influential in shaping musical tastes and practices both in and outside the church. It was the Catholic Church that first popularized the use of [[castrato]] singers in the 16th century, which ultimately led to the popularity of castrato voices in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] [[operas]].&lt;ref name="Stark"/&gt;

It was not until the development of opera in the 17th century that vocal pedagogy began to break away from some of the established thinking of the monastic writers and develop deeper understandings of the physical process of singing and its relation to key concepts like [[vocal registration]] and [[vocal resonation]]. It was also during this time, that noted [[voice teacher]]s began to emerge. [[Giulio Caccini]] is an example of an important early Italian voice teacher.&lt;ref name="groveONE"/&gt; In the late 17th century, the [[bel canto]] method of singing began to develop in Italy. This style of singing had a huge impact on the development of opera and the development of vocal pedagogy during the [[Classical music era|Classical]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] periods. It was during this time, that teachers and composers first began to identify singers by and write roles for more specific [[voice types]]. However, it wasn't until the 19th century that more clearly defined voice classification systems like the German [[Fach]] system emerged. Within these systems, more descriptive terms were used in classifying voices such as [[coloratura soprano]] and [[lyric soprano]].&lt;ref name=Stark/&gt;

[[File:Garcia-Laryngoskop.gif|thumb|left|175px|Examining the vocal mechanism with a [[laryngoscope]], late 19th century]]
Voice teachers in the 19th century continued to train singers for careers in opera.  [[Manuel Patricio Rodríguez García]] is often considered one of the most important voice teachers of the 19th century, and is credited with the development of the [[laryngoscope]] and the beginning of modern voice pedagogy.
[[File:Matilde Marchesi.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Mathilde Marchesi]] was both an important singer and teacher of singing at the turn of the 20th century.]]
The field of voice pedagogy became more fully developed in the middle of the 20th century.  A few American voice teachers began to study the science, anatomy, and physiology of singing, especially [[Ralph Appelman]] at [[Indiana University]], [[Oren Brown]] at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] and later the [[Juilliard School]], and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]].  This shift in approach to the study of singing led to the rejection of many of the assertions of the [[bel canto]] singing method, most particularly in the areas of [[vocal registration]] and [[vocal resonation]].&lt;ref name=Gurnee&gt;{{cite book 
|title= In Memoriam: William D. Vennard
|last= Gurnee
|first=  Robert T. 
|year= 1986
|publisher= [[The NATS Bulletin]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there are currently two predominating schools of thought among voice teachers today, those who maintain the historical positions of the [[bel canto]] method and those who choose to embrace more contemporary understandings based in current knowledge of human anatomy and physiology. There are also those teachers who borrow ideas from both perspectives, creating a hybrid of the two.&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;

 |isbn=978-0-8258-0055-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Appelman/&gt;

Appelman and Vennard were also part of a group of voice instructors who developed courses of study for beginning voice teachers, adding these scientific ideas to the standard exercises and empirical ways to improve vocal technique, and by 1980 the subject of voice pedagogy was beginning to be included in many college music degree programs for singers and vocal music educators.&lt;ref name=Gurnee/&gt;

More recent works by authors such as [[Richard Miller (singer)|Richard Miller]] and Johan Sundberg have increased the general knowledge of voice teachers, and scientific and practical aspects of voice pedagogy continue to be studied and discussed by professionals.  In addition, the creation of organisations such as the [[National Association of Teachers of Singing]] (now an international organization of Vocal Instructors) has enabled voice teachers to establish more of a consensus about their work, and has expanded the understanding of what singing teachers do.&lt;ref name=McKinney/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Miller"&gt;{{cite book

==Topics of study==

===Pedagogical philosophy===
There are basically three major approaches to vocal pedagogy, all related to how the  mechanistic and psychological controls are employed within the act of singing. Some voice instructors advocate an extreme mechanistic approach that believes that singing is largely a matter of getting the right physical parts in the right places at the right time, and that correcting vocal faults is accomplished by calling direct attention to the parts which are not working well. On the other extreme, is the school of thought that believes that attention should never be directed to any part of the vocal mechanism—that singing is a matter of producing the right mental images of the desired tone, and that correcting vocal faults is achieved by learning to think the right thoughts and by releasing the emotions through interpretation of the music. Most voice teachers, however, believe that the truth lies somewhere in between the two extremes and adopt a composite of those two approaches.&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;

===The nature of vocal sounds===

====Physiology of vocal sound production====
[[File:Illu bronchi lungs.jpg|350px|right]]
There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence: 
#Breath is taken
#Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
#The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
#The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are to be considered separately, in actual practice they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

=====Respiration=====
[[File:Gray1204.png|right|300px|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords.]]
In its most basic sense, respiration is the process of moving air in and out of the body—inhalation and exhalation. Breathing for singing and speaking is a more controlled process than is the ordinary breathing used for sustaining life. The controls applied to exhalation are particularly important in good vocal technique.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

=====Phonation=====
[[Phonation]] is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the [[vocal folds]] that is in turn modified by the resonance of the [[vocal tract]].&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94–101. PM 18225701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org), {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place in the [[larynx]] when the [[vocal folds]] are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them in such a way that vibration ensues causing an audible source of acoustic energy, i.e., sound, which can then be modified by the articulatory actions of the rest of the [[vocal apparatus]]. The vocal folds are brought together primarily by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, which pull the [[arytenoid cartilages]] together.&lt;ref name=McKinney/&gt;

=====Resonation=====
{{main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney" /&gt;

There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[human chest|chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt;

Research has shown that the larynx, the pharynx and the oral cavity are the main resonators of vocal sound, with the nasal cavity only coming into play in nasal consonants, or nasal vowels, such as those found in French. This main resonating space, from above the vocal folds to the lips is known as the [[vocal tract]]. Many voice users experience sensations in the sinuses that may be misconstrued as resonance. However, these sensations are caused by sympathetic vibrations, and are a result, rather than a cause, of efficient vocal resonance.&lt;ref name = "Miller"/&gt;

=====Articulation=====
{{main|Place of articulation}}
[[File:Places of articulation.svg|thumb|200px|Places of articulation (passive &amp; active):&lt;br /&gt;1. Exo-labial, 2. Endo-labial, 3. Dental, 4. Alveolar, 5. Post-alveolar, 6. Pre-palatal, 7. Palatal, 8. Velar, 9. Uvular, 10. Pharyngeal, 11. Glottal, 12. Epiglottal, 13. Radical, 14. Postero-dorsal, 15. Antero-dorsal, 16. Laminal, 17. Apical, 18. Sub-apical]]
Articulation is the process by which the joint product of the vibrator and the resonators is shaped into recognizable speech sounds through the muscular adjustments and movements of the speech organs. These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip ("[[labial consonant]]s"), the flexible front of the tongue ("[[coronal consonant]]s"), the middle/back of the tongue ("[[dorsal consonant]]s"), the root of the tongue together with the [[epiglottis]] ("[[pharyngeal consonant]]s"), and the [[glottis]] ("[[glottal consonant]]s"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called ''coarticulation''.

Unlike active articulation, passive articulation is a continuum without many clear-cut boundaries. The places linguolabial and interdental, interdental and dental, dental and alveolar, alveolar and palatal, palatal and velar, velar and uvular merge into one another, and a consonant may be pronounced somewhere between the named places.

In addition, when the front of the tongue is used, it may be the upper surface or ''blade'' of the tongue that makes contact ("[[laminal consonant]]s"), the tip of the tongue ("[[apical consonant]]s"), or the under surface ("[[sub-apical consonant]]s"). These articulations also merge into one another without clear boundaries.

=====Interpretation=====
Interpretation is sometimes listed by voice teachers as a fifth physical process even though strictly speaking it is not a physical process. The reason for this is that interpretation does influence the kind of sound a singer makes which is ultimately achieved through a physical action the singer is doing. Although teachers may acquaint their students with musical styles and performance practices and suggest certain interpretive effects, most voice teachers agree that interpretation can not be taught. Students who lack a natural creative imagination and aesthetic sensibility can not learn it from someone else. Failure to interpret well is not a vocal fault, even though it may affect vocal sound significantly.&lt;ref name="McKinney"/&gt;

====Classification of vocal sounds====
Vocal sounds are divided into two basic categories-[[vowels]] and [[consonants]]-with a wide variety of sub-classifications. Voice Teachers and serious voice students spend a great deal of time studying how the voice forms vowels and consonants, and studying the problems that certain consonants or vowels may cause while singing. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is used frequently by voice teachers and their students.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt;

====Problems in describing vocal sounds====
Describing vocal sound is an inexact science largely because the [[human voice]] is a self-contained instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced is complicated by the vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than what a person listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it "sounds" and more on how it "feels". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.

Another problem in describing vocal sound lies in the vocal vocabulary itself. There are many schools of thought within vocal pedagogy and different schools have adopted different terms, sometimes from other artistic disciplines. This has led to the use of a plethora of descriptive terms applied to the voice which are not always understood to mean the same thing. Some terms sometimes used to describe a quality of a voice's sound are: warm, white, dark, light, round, reedy, spread, focused, covered, swallowed, forward, ringing, hooty, bleaty, plummy, mellow, pear-shaped, and so forth.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

===Body Alignment===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body exist. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the body alignment of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the [[diaphragmatic breathing|diaphragm]]. Good body alignment allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good body alignment also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Voice Instructors have also noted that when singers assume good body alignment it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good body alignment. Habitual good body alignment also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

===Breathing and breath support===
In the words of Robert C. White, who paraphrased a "Credo" for singing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the Beginning there was Breath, and Singing was with Breath, and Singing was Breath, and Singing ''was'' Breath. And all singing was made by the Breath, and without Breath was not any Singing made that was made. (White 1988, p. 26)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All singing begins with [[breath]]. All vocal sounds are created by [[vibrations]] in the [[larynx]] caused by air from the [[lungs]].  [[Breathing]] in everyday life is a [[subconscious]] bodily function which occurs naturally, however the [[singer]] must have control of the intake and exhalation of breath to achieve maximum results from their voice.

Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing-out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing there are four stages of breathing:
# breathing-in period (inhalation)
# setting up controls period (suspension)
# controlled exhalation period (phonation)
# recovery period
These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;{{cite journal

===Voice classification===
{{main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Voice type}}
In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of  the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to: [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

 |pages= 17–27
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] and has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including: the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering children's voices, an eighth term, [[boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney" /&gt;

It should be noted that within [[choral music]], singers voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB). As a result, the typical choral situation affords many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[Contemporary Commercial Music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to adopt classical [[voice type]] terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy. The development of voice categorizations were made with the understanding that the singer would be using classical vocal technique within a specified range using unamplified (no microphones) vocal production. Since contemporary musicians use different vocal techniques, microphones, and are not forced to fit into a specific vocal role, applying such terms as soprano, tenor, baritone, etc. can be misleading or even inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Appelman"&gt;

====Dangers of quick identification====
Many voice teachers warn of the dangers of quick identification. Premature concern with classification can result in misclassification, with all its attendant dangers. Vennard says:

"I never feel any urgency about classifying a beginning student. So many premature diagnoses have been proved wrong, and it can be harmful to the student and embarrassing to the teacher to keep striving for an ill-chosen goal. It is best to begin in the middle part of the voice and work upward and downward until the voice classifies itself."&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

Most voice teachers believe that it is essential to establish good vocal habits within a limited and comfortable range before attempting to classify the voice. When techniques of posture, breathing, [[phonation]], resonation, and articulation have become established in this comfortable area, the true quality of the voice will emerge and the upper and lower limits of the range can be explored safely. Only then can a tentative classification be arrived at, and it may be adjusted as the voice continues to develop.&lt;ref name=Greene /&gt; Many acclaimed voice instructors suggest that teachers begin by assuming that a voice is of a medium classification until it proves otherwise. The reason for this is that the majority of individuals possess medium voices and therefore this approach is less likely to misclassify or damage the voice.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

===Vocal registration===
{{main|Vocal registration}}
{{Vocal registration}}
'''Vocal registration''' refers to the system of vocal registers within the human voice. A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns. Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;
{{cite journal 
 |last=Large
 |first= John
 |date=February–March 1972
 |title= Towards an integrated physiologic-acoustic theory of vocal registers
 |journal= The NATS Bulletin
 |volume= 28
 |pages= 30–35
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term register can be somewhat confusing as it encompasses several aspects of the human voice. The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name="McKinney"/&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process
* A certain vocal [[timbre]]
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.
* A subset of a [[language]] used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system.

Within [[speech pathology]] the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many teachers of singing.&lt;ref name="McKinney" /&gt;

Some voice teachers, however, organize registers differently. There are over a dozen different constructs of vocal registers in use within the field. The confusion which exists concerning what a register is, and how many registers there are, is due in part to what takes place in the modal register when a person sings from the lowest [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] of that register to the highest pitches. The frequency of vibration of the vocal folds is determined by their length, tension, and mass. As pitch rises, the [[vocal fold]]s are lengthened, tension increases, and their thickness decreases. In other words, all three of these factors are in a state of flux in the transition from the lowest to the highest tones.&lt;ref name=Large /&gt;

If a singer holds any of these factors constant and interferes with their progressive state of change, his [[larynx|laryngeal]] function tends to become static and eventually breaks occur with obvious changes of tone quality. These breaks are often identified as register boundaries or as transition areas between registers. The distinct change or break between registers is called a [[passaggio]] or a [[ponticello]].&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;John Warrack, Ewan West. ‘’The Oxford Dictionary of Opera’’, {{ISBN|0-19-869164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocal instructors teach that with study a singer can move effortlessly from one register to the other with ease and consistent tone. Registers can even overlap while singing. Teachers who like to use this theory of "blending registers" usually help students through the "passage" from one register to another by hiding their "lift" (where the voice changes).

However, many voice instructors disagree with this distinction of boundaries blaming such breaks on vocal problems which have been created by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place. This difference of opinion has effected the different views on vocal registration.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

===Coordination===
Singing is an integrated and coordinated act and it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in, intensively, on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney" /&gt;
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Some consider that singing is not a natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others consider that some ways of singing can be considered as natural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=https://naturalvoice.net/about|website=Natural Voice Practitioners' Network|accessdate=16 April 2016}} ''For thousands of years all over the world people have sung—to express joy, celebration and grief, to aid healing, to accompany work, devotion and the rituals of life—without worrying about having a ‘good’ voice or ‘getting it right’''.&lt;/ref&gt; Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

=====Exercising the singing voice=====
There are several purposes for vocal exercises, including:&lt;ref name="McKinney" /&gt;
# Warming up the voice
# Extending the vocal range
# "Lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically
# Acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to comfortably sing wide intervals, and correcting vocal faults.

=====Extending the vocal range=====
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Voice instructors teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most voice teachers believe that the first step in coordinating these processes is by establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice first before slowly expanding the range beyond that.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors which significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:
#The Energy Factor&amp;nbsp; – In this usage the word energy has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound. It refers to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism. It also refers to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance that pressure, and it refers to the dynamic level of the sound.
#The Space Factor&amp;nbsp;– Space refers to the amount of space created by the moving of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher they sing. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by the relaxing of the throat. Voice teachers often describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
#The Depth Factor&amp;nbsp;– In this usage the word depth has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism and it refers to mental concepts of depth as related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney" /&gt;

===General music studies===
Some voice teachers will spend time working with their students on general music knowledge and skills, particularly [[music theory]], [[music history]], and musical styles and practices as it relates to the vocal literature being studied. If required they may also spend time helping their students become better sight readers, often adopting [[solfège]], which assigns certain syllables to the notes of the scale.

===Performance skills and practices===
Since singing is a performing art, voice teachers spend some of their time preparing their students for performance. This includes teaching their students etiquette of behavior on stage such as bowing, addressing problems like stage fright or nervous tics, and the use of equipment such as microphones. Some students may also be preparing for careers in the fields of [[opera]] or [[musical theater]] where acting skills are required. Many voice instructors will spend time on acting techniques and audience communication with students in these fields of interest. Students of opera also spend a great deal of time with their voice teachers learning foreign language pronunciations.

'''World Metrology Day''' celebrates the signature by representatives of seventeen nations of the [[Metre Convention]] on [[20 May]] 1875. The Convention set the framework for global collaboration in the science of measurement and in its industrial, commercial and societal application. The original aim of the Metre Convention – the worldwide uniformity of measurement – remains as important today as it was in 1875.

The World Metrology Day project is currently realized jointly by the [[BIPM]] and the [[OIML]].
