The '''Agris Helmet ''' ({{lang-fr|'''Casque d'Agris'''}}) is a ceremonial [[Celts|Celtic]] helmet from {{circa|350}}&amp;nbsp;BC that was found in a cave near [[Agris]], Charente, France, in 1981.
It is a masterpiece of [[Celtic art]], and would probably have been used for display rather than worn in battle.
The helmet consists of an iron cap completely covered with bands of bronze.
The bronze is in turn covered with unusually pure gold leaf, with embedded coral decorations attached using silver rivets.
One of the cheek guards was also found and has similar materials and designs.
The helmet is mostly decorated in early Celtic patterns but there are later Celtic motifs and signs of Etruscan or Greek influence.
The quality of the gold indicates that the helmet may well have been made locally in the Atlantic region.

==Discovery==

The Agris helmet was found in a cave near [[Angoulême]] in 1981.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
The Perrats cave had been known for just over a week when [[caver]]s found two contiguous parts of the front of the helmet on 9–10 May 1981.
The fragments were on a cone of debris thrown out from a badger burrow in the cave's main chamber.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
An excavation team was quickly formed to search the site. They found scraps of gold leaf, two fragments that joined to form a larger triangular piece, and then the helmet itself, which was well-preserved other than the part that had been torn off by the badgers.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

The site shows signs of having been occupied from the [[Bronze Age]] through the [[Iron Age]], the Gallo-Roman period and into the [[Middle Ages]].
The entrance collapsed and closed the cave in the 13th or 14th century AD.{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=196}}
At the time of discovery almost all the parts of the helmet had been disturbed by burrowing animals.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
In 1983, the cheek guard and three fragments of ornamentation from the side of the helmet were discovered during excavations.
Other fragments were found in 1986, including the base of the helmet's crest, several meters from where the helmet had been found.
They seem to have been carried there accidentally, either by people or by badgers.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The second cheek guard and the ornamentation of the summit of the helmet have not been found.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}

The government bought the found objects from the proprietor of the land.
The helmet was restored by Laszlo von Lehóczky at the [[Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz)]].{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
It is now held by the ''[[Musée d'Angoulême]]'' in [[Angoulême]], France.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}{{efn|It is sometimes reported that the helmet was given to the Archaeological and Historical Society of the Charente. This is incorrect.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}} }}
The helmet is considered one of the masterpieces of Celtic art and has been featured in several international exhibitions.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
It has even formed the basis for a graphic novel, ''Le casque d'Agris'' (2005).{{sfn|Luccisano|2005}}

==Context==
{{Location map|France|caption=Location of [[Agris]] to the west of the [[Massif Central]] in France|relief=y|lat_deg= 45.7755|lon_deg=0.3358}}
Excavations in 2002 show that the cave entrance was guarded by a mud wall and a ditch, and would have been a sanctuary until the early [[Roman Empire]].
The helmet is isolated, with no sign of a human burial, and was buried deliberately.
At the time of burial at least some of the external ornaments had been broken off and placed in the interior of the helmet.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
The helmet had been carefully placed.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The archaeologists who found it think it may have been buried as part of a ritual to the underworld spirits.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
Roman sources say that the Celtic warriors generally did not wear helmets.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=43}}
The helmet would have been used for display, and would have indicated the high rank of the owner, or their wish to obtain such a rank.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=376}}

The helmet dates from the early period of the [[La Tène culture]].{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The gold leaf is extremely pure, and the helmet may be one of the oldest refined gold objects of Western Europe.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
It was found further west than most other examples of high-status La Tène metalwork.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
A few similar objects have been found in France at [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] (Normandy), [[Saint-Jean-Trolimon]] (Brittany) and Montlaurès near [[Narbonne]] (Aude) and in Italy at [[Canosa di Puglia|Canosa (Puglia)]].{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}

The design of the inner iron cap is similar to that of a series of helmets that have mostly been found in the Central Alps.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The veneer of bronze strips recalls Italian helmets of the [[Montefortino]] type.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The [[palmette]]-based design links it to the early style of the La Tène culture.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
Most of the motifs in the decoration belong to the first western style of the culture, or are closely derived from this style.
Other motifs are from an intermediate stage with the [[Waldalgesheim style]].{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

Authorities differ on the date of the helmet.
In a 2001 paper José Gomez De Soto suggests the middle or the second half of the 4th century.{{sfn|Gomez de Soto|2001|p=213}}
D. W. Harding says the stratigraphic association of the helmet with a Dux-type ''[[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]'' from La Tène B and other signs indicate that it was made in the later part of the 4th century.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
However, in a 2010 paper Gomez de Soto and Stephane Verger conclude that the decorations, when viewed as a whole, indicate that the helmet was made in the 2nd quarter or the middle of the 4th century.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Structure==
[[File:Casque d'Agris, musée d'Angoulême, Lamiot 2015 01.JPG|thumb|View of the helmet showing the neck guard (lower left) and cheek protector (lower center)]]
The helmet has been described as having a jockey-cap shape, but the "bill" of the cap is actually a neck-guard.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=75}}
It is {{convert|21.4|cm}} high and {{convert|23|by|19|cm}} laterally.{{sfn|Eluère|1984|p=110}}
The inner cap of the helmet is of iron, now heavily corroded.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
It is made of a single piece of hammered iron, with the neck guard riveted to the back.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The iron is entirely covered by ornamental bronze bands with low-relief decoration formed partly by [[casting]] and partly by [[repoussé and chasing]].{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The four wide horizontal strips of bronze are fully covered with gold leaf on the outside surface.
The decorations include embedded [[cabochon]]s of shaped and polished [[Precious coral|coral]].{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

All the relief decorations were formed on the bronze strips before the [[gold leaf]] was applied.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The gold leaf, about 70 microns thick, was affixed by pressing it closely onto the bronze relief with a tool that may have been made of wood or bone.
The gold leaf would have been held in place by the grooves and imitation [[filigree]] in the bronze.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=10}}
The coral cabochons were attached to the bronze by silver rivets whose heads are decorated with motifs such as diamonds or palm leaves.{{efn|The rivets are made of an alloy with at least 80% silver, 20% gold and almost 1% copper. This would have been relatively easy to work, but stronger than pure gold or silver.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=12}} }}{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=12}}
Sometimes the hollow that holds the coral was at least partially gold-covered before the coral was placed.
Gold leaf was then applied generously around the coral to form a small cup.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=11}}

There is a finely wrought cheek-piece.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=43}}
The cheek guard (''paragnathide'') and the side and top ornaments used the same materials and techniques as the main helmet.
There are signs that organic materials such as wood and leather were also used.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Decoration==

The helmet is particularly richly ornamented.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The main theme is a series of palmettes, with many of the palmettes and studs infilled with coral.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
The ornamentation is arranged into three superimposed bands completely covered by compositions inspired by plants.
The many different patterns combined into complex compositions make the headpiece one of the richest of ancient Celtic artworks.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

In the lower and upper panels a series of unconnected palmettes are arranged formally in friezes.
The central panel decorations are based on a formal arrangement of S-curves terminating in swelling leaves, with a  filler pattern that includes palmettes, comma-leaves and over-and-under tendrils.
The neck-guard has a less formal and more fluid pattern.
The cheek guard has a palmette design in which may be seen a curled serpent that appears to be horned.
Horned serpents are often found in Romano-Celtic works in Britain and France, but very rarely in early La Tène.
The depiction on the helmet may have some special significance.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}

The decoration mainly reflects the 5th century Early Style of Celtic Art, but some motifs are characteristic of the Waldalgesheim style of the 4th century,{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The central panel designs show similarities to the [[Waldalgesheim]] bracelets.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
This indicates that the helmet was made in the first half of the 4th century.
The large palmettes with seven petals in the lower band and the main frieze in the central band may have been inspired by architectural [[terracotta]] from [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] central Italy in the 5th and 4th centuries.
The neck guard combines Waldalgesheim style with elements of 4th century Greek or Etruscan work.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Origin==
[[File:Casque d'Amfreville Eure.jpg|thumb|The Amfreville helmet, another Celtic prestige helmet from the Atlantic region.]]
Three main regions of the Celtic world have been proposed as the origin of the helmet. The first is the northern or central Adriatic region of Italy.
Some think the new plant-style compositions were developed by Celtic craftsmen who settled in Italy and were influenced by Etruscan or Greek craftsmen with whom they had direct contact.
The complexity of the montage and decoration may be explained by proximity to advanced metalworking centers such as those of [[Taranto]] or [[Campania]].
The objection is that all Celtic helmets from the period found in Italy were in one piece.
Those with riveted neck guards have all been found in the Alps, the regions north of the Alps or the Atlantic region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

The second proposed region of origin is the North Alpine area that formed the ancient center of Celtic culture.
The materials and techniques, and the general composition and decoration, seem to place the work among the best 5th century Celtic works from this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}
The conical shape of the top of the helmet seems to be derived from Celtic helmets from the start of the second Iron Age.
Where these were decorated, the decorations were in superimposed bands.
Some details of the plant ornamentation are very similar to small Celtic ornaments from Austria, the Alpine regions and western Switzerland.
This is the area where helmets with riveted neck guards are found most often.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

The third possibility is that the helmet was made in the area where it was found.
It is one of a small set of prestige helmets that were mostly found in western France, the most famous being the completely decorated helmet of [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] in the Eure.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}
All were made of an iron or bronze cap covered with bands of another metal that were completely decorated.
They have red ornaments, mostly coral.
Riveted neck pieces are also found in this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

Gold samples from various parts of the helmet are exceptionally pure, typically 99% gold, 0.5% silver and 0.2% copper.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
This degree of purity is very unusual in the ancient world.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
Analysis of Greek and Etruscan objects of the period shows much higher silver content.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
Most ancient objects with this degree of purity have been found to the southwest of the [[Loire]], the region that includes Agris.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
The only comparable objects are 3rd century Celtic jewelry from this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
Probably the helmet was made in the West by craftsmen trained in the North Alpine School.{{sfn|Gomez de Soto|2001|p=213}}
The gold may well have come from mines in the west of the [[Massif Central]], which had been in operation since at least the 5th century BC.
Other high-quality works of Celtic art have been found in the Western region, so a local provenance is entirely possible.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}

'''Aluminia''' was a [[Denmark|Danish]] factory of [[faience]] or [[earthenware]] [[pottery]], established in [[Copenhagen]] in 1863. In 1882, the owners of Aluminia purchased
the [[Royal Copenhagen]] porcelain factory. The factories were
operated independently under their respective trade names
until 1969, when the use of the Aluminia name was ended.
Since then the products have been sold under the mark
"Royal Copenhagen Denmark Fajance."

In modern times, the Aluminia factory is best known for the "Blue Line" dinner service, introduced in 1964 and production was stopped by end of year 2010.

The '''Assumption of the Virgin''' ({{lang-it|L'Assunzione della Vergine}}) by [[Annibale Carracci]] is the altarpiece of the famous [[Cerasi Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] in [[Rome]]. The large [[panel painting]] was created in 1600-1601.&lt;ref&gt;Fondazione Federico Zeri - Catalogo Fototeca [http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?tipo_scheda=OA&amp;id=57279&amp;titolo=Carracci%20Annibale,%20Assunzione%20della%20Madonna&amp;locale=it&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true]&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork is somewhat overshadowed by the two more famous paintings of [[Caravaggio]] on the side walls of the chapel: ''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus|The Conversion of Saint Paul on the Road to Damascus]]'' and ''[[Crucifixion of St. Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]''. Both painters were important in the development of [[Baroque]] art but the contrast is striking: Carracci's Virgin glows with even light and radiates harmony, while the paintings of Caravaggio are dramatically lit and foreshortened.

== History ==
The chapel in the left transept of the basilica was built by Monsignor [[Tiberio Cerasi]], [[Advocates of Roman Congregations|Consistorial Advocate]] and Treasurer-General to [[Pope Clement VIII]]. He purchased a chapel on the same spot from the Augustinian friars on 8 July 1600 and commissioned [[Carlo Maderno]] to rebuild the small edifice in Baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hibbard | first = Howard | coauthors = | title = Caravaggio | publisher = [[Westview Press]] | date = 1983 | month = | isbn = 0-06-430128-1 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September Cerasi contracted Caravaggio to paint two panels for the side walls. Presumably another contract was signed at an early stage in the proceedings with Carracci for the altarpiece but this document has not been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mahon: Egregius in Urbe Pictor: Caravaggio revised, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 93, No. 580 (Jul., 1951), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Preparatory studies and sketches by Carracci are preserved in the [[Royal Collection]]. 

The commissions went to the leading artists in Rome at the time: during these years Carracci was busy working on the famous [[The Loves of the Gods|fresco cycle]] of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] for Cardinal [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo Farnese]]. Probably due to his increased workload in the palace, the three ceiling frescos in the chapel were executed by his assistant, [[Innocenzo Tacconi]] following Carracci's design. In these circumstances there was little reason for Carracci and Caravaggio to regard each other as business rivals, states [[Denis Mahon]].&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mahon op. cit. p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberio Cerasi died on 3 May 1601 and was buried in the chapel. In his will he named the Fathers of the Hospital of the Madonna della Consolazione as his heirs with the responsibility to complete the still unfinished chapel.&lt;ref name="Witcombe"&gt;Christopher L. C. E. Witcombe, Two "Avvisi", Caravaggio, and Giulio Mancini, in: Source: Notes in the History of Art, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Spring 1993), pp. 22–29, pag. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Annibale's altarpiece was probably already complete as deduced from an ''avviso'' written perhaps by [[Giulio Mancini]] and dated to 2 June:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The principal painting in the chapel [is] by the said Carracci, those three paintings being, on the whole, of great excellence and beauty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is also confirmed by the fact that there are no recordings of payments in favor of Carracci in the documents concerning the management of the assets of Tiberio Cerasi drawn up after his death. The chapel was finally consecrated on 11 November 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Nolin, "Non piacquero al Padrone: A Reexamination of Caravaggio's Cerasi Crucifixion of St. Peter, in:Rutgers Art Review 24 (2008), pag. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to the [[Assumption of Mary]].

== Description ==

[[File:Annibale Carracci e Caravaggio, Cappella Cerasi.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The painting was designed to be looked at as part of a larger ensemble]]The altarpiece is the fulcrum of the decorative program of the chapel due to its subject and spatial position. There is a strong thematic connection with the scene of the ''Coronation of the Virgin'' in the central medaillon of the barrel-vault that shows the final episode in the [[Life of the Virgin]] after the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. The painting also establishes a dialog with the two Caravaggio canvasses on the lateral walls: the most important figures among the apostles are [[Saint Peter]] (the older man on the left) and [[Saint Paul]] (on the right) in the foreground whose life story is told by Caravaggio (and also by the side paintings on the vault). The thematic and compositional connections prove that the altarpiece was designed to be looked at as part of a larger ensemble and not as a standalone object.

The rather crowded composition is organized around a triad of figures: the Virgin rising from the empty tomb (surrounded by a retinue of angels) and the two apostles gazing upwards in awe. All three wear robes in bright primary colours: blue over red (Mary), yellow over blue (Peter) and pink over green (Paul). The remaining space around the sarcophagus is filled with nine other apostles, bringing their overall number to eleven. "The stiffened forms and crowded composition [...] have been interpreted as a conscious shift to a 'hyper-idealized' manner that rejects the warmth and painterly qualities of his Bolognese period for a style indebted to ancient sculpture and to [[Raphael]]. Still neither ancient reliefs nor Raphael crowded their pictorial fields in this way", says [[Ann Sutherland Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Sutherland Harris: Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture, Laurence King Publishing, London, 2005, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting largely follows the iconographic tradition concerning the depiction of the Assumption in [[Western painting|Western art]]. John the Evangelist (on the left) is portrayed as a beardless young man among the older and bearded apostles. One member of the angelic retinue can be identified as [[Archangel Michael]] who lifted up Mary's body to heaven. An apostle on the right is looking at the grave linens and the roses that were found in the empty sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter and Linda Murray: The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 38
&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the prominent position of the ''principes apostolorum'' is a nod to local sensitivities.

Mary seems to be projecting forward rather than upwards. It is a device that compensates for the confined environment and the rather low position of the altar. In this way, the Assumption meets the observer far beyond the narrow space of the Cerasi Chapel, ensuring its visibility from the transept, an ideal space for the continuation of Mary's motion. The dynamism, the emotional charge and the integration of the painting into real space are strongly innovative elements which make the panel unequaled among the contemporary altarpieces produced in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Tomaso Montanari, Il Barocco, Torino, 2012, pp. 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==

[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Titian's Assumption]]A supposed model for the central figure is the Virgin of the ''Assumption'' by [[Giuseppe Valeriano]] and [[Scipione Pulzone]] in the [[Church of the Gesù]].&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Strinati, L'Assunzione della Vergine di Annibale Carracci, in Maria Grazia Bernardini (a cura di), Caravaggio Carracci Maderno. La cappella Cerasi in Santa Maria del Popolo a Roma, Cinisello Balsamo, 2001, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; An even more important antecedent for the panel is the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]] of [[Raphael]], a masterpiece that Carracci much loved and studied. That Carracci took inspiration for the lighting - a strong spotlight effect giving a sculptural look to the forms -  from Raphael, becomes clear if compare the figure of Saint Peter with the Saint Peter in the same location on the Transfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine E. Kopp: “The Carracci and Venice: Annibale Carracci's stylistic response to Venetian art, and the intermediate roles of Ludovico and Agostino Carracci, thesis, Queen's University, 2014, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]] by [[Titian]] was another great Renaissance painting that may have influenced Carracci while working on the same subject, especially regarding the heads of some of the apostles in deep shadow and in ''profil perdu''.

The relationship between the paintings of Caravaggio and Carracci in the chapel is a perpetual subject of discussion in art history. It seems probable that each artist "subtly altered his style of painting as a result of this direct confrontation with the other", and "Annibale's monumental saints, whose
hands and feet seem to pierce the picture plane" may have influenced Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Ganz: Annibale's Rome: Art and Life in the Eternal City, in The Drawings of Annibale Carracci, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1999, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cerasi Assumption was a turning point in Annibale's painting style as his compositions became darker, the figures larger and more monumental during the last phase of his career. Donald Posner termed his style in this period 'hyper-idealized'.

The painting was not regarded among Carracci's best works by his two 17th-century biographers. [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]] only mentions it shortly when listing the late works of the artist while [[Carlo Cesare Malvasia]] is even more dismissive.&lt;ref&gt;Malvasia's Life of the Carracci: Commentary and Translation, trans. by Anne Summerscale, The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Modern art history showed more appreciation. "The visual effects ensured that the spectators in the chapel space experienced for themselves the onrush of divine energy as the Virgin soared from the tomb, outward and over their heads into the painted vault of the crossing, where the actual Coronation was painted", says Rosemary Muir Wright. "The Virgin herself had become an icon of ideal beauty in a form which owed much of its perfection to the model of Raphael. This idealization provided the necessary reminder of the supernatural nature of the event, despite the obvious visual conviction of natural form and three-dimensional space."&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Muir Wright: Sacred Distance: Representing the Virgin Mary in Italian Altarpieces, 1300-1630, Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bernhard Hertz''' (1834&amp;ndash;1909) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] goldsmith. He established a silver factory in [[Store Kongensgade]] in [[Copenhagen]]. The building has been listed by the [[Danish Heritage Agency]] in the Danish national registry of protected buildings in. His company '''Bernhard Hertz A&amp;S''', founded in 1858, was merged into Lund Copenhagen in 1985.

==Biography==
Bernhard Hertz was born in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koldinghus.dk/samlinger/andre-samlinger/dansk-guld-og-soelv/danske-soelvsmede/danske-soelvsmede-og-designere.html|title=Danske sølvsmede og designere|language=Danish|publisher=Koldinghus|accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his apprenticeship as a gold smith in 1858. His graduation piece, an arm ring, was acquired by [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] for 300 [[Danish rigsdaler]]. The king gave it to [[Countess Danner]]. The arm ring is now on display in the  [[Design Museum Denmark|Danish Design Museum]].

Hertz used the money from the sale to set up his own business the same year. He specialized in modern jewellery with flower motifs and replica of ancient jewellery,

To make his hewellery accessible to a wider customer base, Hertz began to produce the replica of contemporary jewellery in silver instead of gold and introduced machine power in the production for rolling and frosting. om 1887, he constructed a multi-storey factory building in a courtyard in [[Store Kongensgade]].&lt;ref name=Kulturstyrelsen&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kulturarv.dk/fbb/sagvis.pub?sag=3102839|title=Sag: Bernhard Hertz Sølvvarefabrik|language=Danish|publisher=Kulturstyrelsen|accessdate=2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hertz died in 1909.

==Legacy==
The company Bernhard Hertz A&amp;S was in 1985 acquired by [[Lund Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="lund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lundcopenhagen.dk/home/historien/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327190703/http://lundcopenhagen.dk/home/historien/ |title=Historien on Lund Copenhagen |language=Danish |publisher=Lund Copenhagen |archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gertz' former silver factory in Store Kongensgade was listed by the [[Danish Heritage Agency]] in the Danish national registry of protected buildings in 1985. The factory was built to Hertz' own design. Yje older building fronting the street, which was also owned by the company, is also part of the heritage listing. It is from 1850 and was designed by C.O. Aagaard.&lt;ref name=Kulturstyrelsen/&gt;

'''BookSwim''' is a [[Privately held company|private]] [[United States|American]] online [[book rental]] service, offering rental-by-mail of both [[book|hardcover]] and [[paperback books]].  The company was launched in 2007 and has grown steadily since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneursstartupsmagazine/2008/may/193398.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
George Burke co-founded BookSwim with friend [[Shamoon Siddiqui]] in April 2007, in Shamoon's basement for the first ten months of the company’s existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114024721/http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/today/s_510381.html# |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has since branched out, briefly moving to [[Aberdeen, NJ]] before establishing headquarters in [[Newark, NJ]] with distribution facilities in eastern [[Pennsylvania]].

=== Rental Service ===
BookSwim provides unlimited rental-by-mail of [[hardcover]] and [[paperback book]]s on a monthly subscription basis. Subscribers add books to their online reading list, called a Rental Pool. When the subscriber returns finished books, the next books in the Rental Pool ship out. The similarity to [[Netflix]]'s business model has led to the website informally being called the 'Netflix for books.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cnet.com/8301-13512_3-10223739-23.html&lt;/ref&gt;' BookSwim's plans begin at $9.99 per month and include only hardcover and paperback books.

=== Honors &amp; Appearances ===
BookSwim entered and won [[Rutgers University]]’s Business Plan Competition in 2008 and an accompanying cash prize of $20,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gather.com/viewArticle.jsp?articleId=281474977367490&amp;nav=Namespace{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was named a 'Startup to Watch' by [[Entrepreneur Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/entrepreneursstartupsmagazine/2008/may/193398.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the New Jersey Technology Council.

=== Market Conditions &amp; Competitiveness ===
BookSwim's subscribers tend to be high-income avid readers who read over forty books a year; roughly 80% of them are female.&lt;ref&gt;http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/07/bookswim-com-aims-for-sweet-spot-of-american-readers/&lt;/ref&gt; As "the core of [the] business is in bestsellers,&lt;ref&gt;http://publishingperspectives.com/2010/07/bookswim-com-aims-for-sweet-spot-of-american-readers/&lt;/ref&gt;" BookSwim cites its rental of hardcovers as its main competitive edge over competitor [[Booksfree]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2008-05-13/bindley-bookrentals&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vieux-Québec 0024.jpg|thumb|Celtic [[High cross]] in Quebec (Compare with the [[Muiredach's High Cross|original]])]]

The '''Celtic Revival''' (also referred to as the '''Celtic Twilight''' or '''Celtomania''') was a variety of movements and trends in the 19th and 20th centuries that saw a renewed interest in aspects of Celtic culture.  Artists and writers drew on the traditions of [[Gaelic literature]], [[Welsh-language literature]], and so-called '[[Celtic art]]'—what historians call [[Insular art]] (the [[Early Medieval]] style of [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]]). Although the revival was complex and multifaceted, occurring across many fields and in various countries in [[Northwest Europe]], its best known incarnation is probably the [[Irish Literary Revival]]. Here, Irish writers including [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Lady Gregory]], [[George William Russell|"AE" Russell]], [[Edward Martyn]] and [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Edward Plunkett]] (Lord Dunsany) stimulated a new appreciation of traditional [[Irish literature]] and [[Irish poetry]] in the late 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Foster (2003), pp. 486, 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many, but not all, facets the revival came to represent a reaction to [[modernisation]]. This is particularly true in Ireland, where the relationship between the archaic and the modern was antagonistic, where history was fractured, and where, according to [[Terry Eagleton]], "as a whole [the nation] had not leapt at a bound from [[tradition]] to [[modernity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Castle, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; At times this [[romanticism|romantic]] view of the past resulted in historically inaccurate portrayals, such as the promotion of [[noble savage]] stereotypes of the [[Irish people]] and [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish Highlanders]], as well as a [[racialized]] view that referred to the Irish, whether positively or [[Anti-Irish sentiment|negatively]], as a separate [[Race (human categorization)|race]].&lt;ref name=MacManus1&gt;{{cite book |first=Seamus |last=MacManus |title=The Story of the Irish Race: A Popular History of Ireland |year=1921 |publisher=The Irish Publishing Co |location=Ireland |isbn=0-517-06408-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/storyofirishrace00macmrich |accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most widespread and lasting contribution of the revival was the re-introduction of the [[High cross]] as the [[Celtic cross]], which now forms a familiar part of monumental and [[funerary art]] over most of the [[Western world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.celtarts.com/revival_crosses.htm Stephen Walker, "Celtic Revival Crosses"], Celtic Arts Website, accessed 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Though, there has been criticism to the unified concept of Celtic culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2015/09/there-s-no-such-thing-celt-s-why-we-had-invent-them |title= There’s no such thing as a Celt – that’s why we had to invent them |author= Erica Wagner |publisher= [[New Statesman]] |date= 25 September 2015 |accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Antiquary|Antiquarian]] researches into the Gaelic and Brittonic cultures and histories of Britain and Ireland gathered pace from the late 17th century, with people like [[Owen Jones (antiquary)|Owen Jones]] in [[Wales]] and [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|Charles O'Conor]] in Ireland. The key surviving manuscript sources were gradually located, edited and translated, monuments identified and published, and other essential groundwork in recording stories, music and language done.

The Welsh antiquarian and author [[Iolo Morganwg]] fed the growing fascination in all things Brittonic by founding the [[Gorsedd]], which (along with his writings) would in turn spark the [[Neo-druidism]] movement.

Interest in [[Scottish Gaelic]] culture greatly increased during the onset of the Romantic period in the late 18th century, with [[James Macpherson]]'s ''[[Ossian]]'' achieving international fame, along with the novels of Sir [[Walter Scott]] and the poetry and song lyrics of the London-based Irishman [[Thomas Moore]], [[Byron]]'s friend and executor.  Throughout Europe, the Romantic movement inspired a great revival of interest in [[folklore]], folk tales, and [[folk music]]; even [[Beethoven]]&lt;ref name="Castle, 239"&gt;Castle, 239&lt;/ref&gt; was commissioned to produce a set of arrangements of Scottish folk-songs.  As elsewhere, in what was then the United Kingdom of the whole archipelago, this encouraged and fed off a rise in nationalism, which was especially intense in Ireland.

[[File:Edward Atkinson Hornel - Druids Bringing In The Mistletoe.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Druids Bringing in the Mistletoe'' (1890) by [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]]]]
In the mid-19th century the revival continued, with Sir [[Samuel Ferguson]], the [[Young Ireland]] movement, and others popularising folk tales, dubious works of history, and other material in all the nations with a claim to be 'Celtic'. At the same time, archaeological and historical work was beginning to make progress in constructing a better understanding of regional history. Interest in ornamental 'Celtic' art developed, and 'Celtic' motifs began to be used in all sorts of contexts, including architecture, drawing on works like the ''Grammar of Ornament'' by [[Owen Jones (architect)|(another) Owen Jones]].  Imitations of the ornate [[Insular art|Insular]] [[penannular brooch]]es of the 7–9th centuries were worn by [[Queen Victoria]] among others from the late 1840s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about Royal Collection] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609042602/http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=12457&amp;row=15&amp;detail=about |date=9 June 2011 }}, Brooch given in November 1849, and [http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/egallery/object.asp?searchText=brooch&amp;x=10&amp;y=7&amp;pagesize=20&amp;object=4833&amp;row=16&amp;detail=about Christmas 1849].&lt;/ref&gt; many produced in Dublin&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=imagetext&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=0&amp;q=penannular+brooch&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= Victorian penannular brooches from the [[V&amp;A Museum]].]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[West Jewellers|West &amp; Son]] and other makers.

In Scotland were [[John Francis Campbell]]'s (1821-1885) works the bilingual [[Popular Tales of the West Highlands]] (4 vols., 1860–62) and The Celtic Dragon Myth, published posthumously in 1911. The formation of the [[Edinburgh Social Union]] in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Craft]] and [[Aesthetic movement]]s, became part of an attempt to facilitate a 'Celtic' Revival in Scotland, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.&lt;ref name=Gardiner2005p170&gt;Gardiner (2005), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer [[Patrick Geddes]] (1854–1932), the architect and designer [[Robert Lorimer]] (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist [[Douglas Strachan]] (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at [[Ramsay Garden]] on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were [[Anna Traquair]] (1852–1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh]] (1885–86 and 1896–98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery and book binding.&lt;ref name=MacDonad2000p155-6&gt;MacDonald, (2000), pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant exponent of the artistic revival in Scotland was Dundee-born [[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] (1866–1945). Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects ''Tristan and Iseult'' (1912) and ''St Bride'' (1913).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald (2000), pp. 156–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan also helped to make Dundee a major centre for the Celtic Revival movement along with artists such as [[Stewart Carmichael]] and the publisher Malcolm C MacLeod.&lt;ref name="jarron"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jarron|first1=Matthew|title="Independent &amp; Individualist": Art in Dundee 1867-1924|date=2015|publisher=University of Dundee Museum Services / Abertay Historical Society|location=Dundee|isbn=978-0-900019-56-2|pages=48–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Francis Cargeeg Jar.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Modern copper jar, using a Celtic motif in restrained fashion.]]
The [[Irish Literary Revival]] encouraged the creation of works written in the spirit of [[Culture of Ireland|Irish culture]], as distinct from [[Culture of England|English culture]]. This was, in part, due to the political need for an individual Irish identity. This difference was kept alive by invoking Ireland's historic past, its [[Irish mythology|myths]], legends and folklore. There was an attempt to re-vitalize the native rhythm and music of Irish Gaelic. Figures such as [[Lady Gregory]], [[WB Yeats]], [[George William Russell|George Russell]], [[John Millington Synge|J .M. Synge]] and [[Seán O'Casey]] wrote many plays and articles about the political state of Ireland at the time. [[Gaelic revival]] and Irish nationalism frequently overlapped in places such as [[An Stad]], a tobacconist on North Frederick Street owned by the writer Cathal McGarvey and frequented by literary figures such as [[James Joyce]] (although Joyce was thoroughly contemptuous of the movement, feeling it betrayed the realities of urban Ireland) and Yeats, along with leaders of the [[Irish Nationalism|Nationalist movement]] such as [[Douglas Hyde]], [[Arthur Griffith]] and [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]. These were connected with another great symbol of the literary revival, The [[Abbey Theatre]], which served as the stage for many new Irish writers and playwrights of the time.

In 1892, Sir [[Charles Gavan Duffy]] said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A group of young men, among the most generous and disinterested in our annals, were busy digging up the buried relics of our history, to enlighten the present by a knowledge of the past, setting up on their pedestals anew the overthrown statues of Irish worthies, assailing wrongs which under long impunity had become unquestioned and even venerable, and warming as with strong wine the heart of the people, by songs of valour and hope; and happily not standing isolated in their pious work, but encouraged and sustained by just such an army of students and sympathizers as I see here to-day".&lt;ref name="Castle, 239"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Celtic Revival (also often referred to as the "Celtic Twilight") was an international movement. The Irish-American designer [[Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy|Thomas Augustus "Gus" O'Shaughnessy]] made a conscious choice to use Irish design roots as well as Art Nouveau influences in his artwork. Trained in stained glass and working in an Art Nouveau style, O'Shaughnessy designed a series of windows and interior stencils for [[Old St. Patrick's Church (Chicago, Illinois)|Old Saint Patrick's Church]] in Chicago, a project begun in 1912 and completed in 1922.  [[Louis Sullivan]], the Chicago architect, incorporated dense Art Nouveau and 'Celtic'-inspired interlace in the ornament of his buildings. Sullivan's father was a traditional Irish musician and they both were step-dancers, which suggests that his creativity was not rooted only in his official education. In England, the [[Watts Mortuary Chapel]] (1896–98) in [[Surrey]] was a thoroughgoing attempt to decorate a [[Romanesque Revival]] chapel framework with lavish Celtic reliefs designed by [[Mary Fraser Tytler]]. 
[[File:Tattoo2bg 100599.jpg|thumb|left|Celtic-style tattoo]]
The "plastic style" of early 'Celtic' art was one of the elements feeding into [[Art Nouveau]] decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the [[Isle of Man|Manxman]] [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who did much work for [[Liberty &amp; Co.]], especially for the [[Tudric]] and Cymric ranges of metalwork, respectively in pewter and silver or gold. Many of the most extravagant examples of the plastic style come from the modern [[Czech Lands]] and influenced the Czech Art Nouveau designer and artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] (Mucha, in turn, influenced the Irish-American O'Shaughnessy, who had attended a series of Mucha's lectures in Chicago).
[[Interlace (art)|Interlace]], (a.k.a. Entrelac) which is still seen as a "Celtic" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Viking art|Scandinavian]] medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades, it had a re-revival in 1960s designs (for example, in the [[Biba]] logo) and has been used worldwide in tattoos and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] setting. ''[[The Secret of Kells]]'' is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the [[Book of Kells]] which makes much use of Insular design.

In France, [[Sublime (literary)|sublime]] descriptions of Celtic landscape were found in the works of [[Jacques Cambry]]. The Celtic Revival was strengthened by [[Napoleon]]'s idea that the "French were a race of empire-building Celts," and became institutionalized by the foundation of the [[Societé des Antiquaires de France|Académie Celtique]] in 1805, by Cambry and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Watts|first=Andrew|title=Preserving the provinces: small town and countryside in the work of Honoré de Balzac|year=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03910-583-0|pages=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KC-F05UY7BoC&amp;pg=PA168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Duncan (painter)|John Duncan]] was one of the leading artists of the Celtic Revival and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]].

==Linguistic revivals, after 1920==
===Wales===
The [[Welsh language]] has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history, and in recent centuries has been easily the most widely-spoken [[Celtic language]].  But by 1911 it had become a minority language, spoken by 43.5% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed that 21.7% of the population of Wales spoke Welsh,&lt;ref name="2004Survey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/files/admin/file/Course_Documents/Survey_Methods/Survey%20Reports/Welsh%20Survey%20&amp;%20Report%2004.pdf|title=2004 Welsh Language Use Survey: the report|format=PDF|date=|accessdate=5 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427211017/http://linguistics.uoregon.edu/files/admin/file/Course_Documents/Survey_Methods/Survey%20Reports/Welsh%20Survey%20%26%20Report%2004.pdf|archivedate=27 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with 20.8% in the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], and 18.5% in 1991. The [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], however, showed a slight decline to 562,000, or 19% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  In Wales, 16% of state school pupils now receive a [[Welsh medium education]], and Welsh is a compulsory subject in English medium schools, up to the age of 15-16.

===Irish===
{{Main|Gaelic revival}}
{{see also|Status of the Irish language}} 
Due to the revival of Irish in educational settings and bilingual upbringing, there has been an increase in young Irish people speaking the language in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. It is said it is more common to hear it spoken in Irish cities. Additionally, there is a "modest" revived interest in North America in learning Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/a-modest-revival-for-the-irish-language/2012/01/25/gIQABC3ftR_story.html|title= A modest revival for the Irish language|author= Daniel de Vise |publisher= [[The Washington Post]] |date= 5 March 2012|accessdate= 23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nova Scotia ====
[[Nova Scotia]] contains the largest population of Celtic people in North America, holding the largest population of [[Scots Gaelic]] speakers outside of Scotland

Also [[Breton language|Breton]] is still spoken to a lesser extent in [[Cape Breton]], it is also home to the only Celtic language outside of Europe, [[Canadian Gaelic]].

===England===
[[File:Kingswood War Memorial - geograph.org.uk - 7032.jpg|thumb|[[Kingswood,_Surrey|Kingswood]] war memorial]]
The term ''Celtic Revival'' is sometimes used to refer to the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] cultural Celtic revival of the early twentieth century. This was characterised by an increased interest in the [[Cornish language]] started by [[Henry Jenner]] and [[Robert Morton Nance]] in 1904. The [[Federation of Old Cornwall Societies]] was formed in 1924 to "maintain the Celtic spirit of Cornwall", followed by the [[Gorseth Kernow]] in 1928 and the formation of the Cornish political party [[Mebyon Kernow]] in 1951. This revival has spread towards Northern England, with the attempted reconstructions of numerous types of bagpipe (such as the Lancashire Great-pipe) and an increased interest in the [[Northumbrian smallpipes]]. There are also attempts to reconstruct the [[Cumbric language]], the ancient [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] language of Northern (particularly Northwestern) England, a remnant of the Brittonic kingdoms of [[Hen Ogledd]].

===France===

==== Brittany ====
In 1925, Professor [[Roparz Hemon]] founded the Breton-language review ''[[Gwalarn]].'' During its 19-year run, ''Gwalarn'' tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language. Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, ''[[Al Liamm]]'' replaced ''Gwalarn''. Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.

In 1977, [[Diwan (school)|Diwan schools]] were founded to teach Breton by [[Language immersion|immersion]]. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the [[Breton language#Education|education section]] for more information.

The ''[[Asterix]]'' comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the [[Gaul]]ish village where Asterix lives is in the [[Armorica|Armorica peninsula]], which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', ''[[Spirou et Fantasio|Spirou]]'', ''[[Titeuf]]'', ''[[Hägar the Horrible]]'', ''[[Peanuts]]'' and ''[[Yakari]]''.

Some original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, ''Ken Tuch'', is in Breton. [[Radio Kerne]], broadcasting from [[Finistère]], has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (''[[Lancelot du Lac (film)|Lancelot du Lac]]'', ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', ''Marion du Faouet'', ''Sezneg'') and TV series (''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'') have also been translated and broadcast in Breton. Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including [[Yann-Ber Kalloc'h]], [[Roparz Hemon]], Anjela Duval, [[Xavier de Langlais]], [[Pêr-Jakez Helias]], [[Youenn Gwernig]], [[Glenmor]] and [[Alan Stivell]] are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] that is not recognized by national government as an official or regional language.

The first Breton dictionary, the ''[[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|Catholicon]]'', was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Please clarify|clarification needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt; is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, ''Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here'' (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.

In the early 21st century, the ''[[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]]'' ("Office of the Breton language") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the [[Spilhennig]] to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an [[Internationalization and localization]] policy asking [[Google]], [[Firefox]] and [[SPIP]] to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the [[Breton Wikipedia]] started, which now counts more than 50,000 articles. In March 2007, the ''Ofis ar Brezhoneg'' signed a tripartite agreement with [[Regional Council of Brittany]] and [[Microsoft]] for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, [[Facebook]] added Breton as one of its 121 languages, after three years of talks between the ''Ofis'' and Facebook.

==== Auvergne ====
In the [[Auvergne (province)]], chants are sung around bonfires remembering a Celtic god. There are also modern attempts to revive the polytheistic religion of the [[Gauls]].

Auvergne is also a hotpot for the Gaulish revival movement, being the location of numerous important Gaulish sites and the home of the legendary Gaulish warrior, [[Vercingetorix]].

Currently 338 people here speak or have some knowledge of the Gaulish language.

==== Other Areas ====
The [[Gaulish language]] used to be widely spoken in France and beyond. In recent times there have been attempts at revivals, despite very limited evidence for the exact original form of the language. [[Eluveitie]] is a metal band whom most of their songs are in a revived Gaulish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/24897674/The_Revival_of_Gaulish_as_a_Modern_Language_Modern_Gaulish_or_Gal%C3%A1thach_hAthev%C3%ADu https://glosbe.com/en/mis_gal academic paper]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charrette''' (American pronunciation: {{IPAc-en|ʃ|ɑː|ˈ|ɹ|ɛ|t|}}), often Anglicized to '''charette''' or '''charet''' and sometimes called a '''design charrette''', is an intense period of [[design]] or [[planning]] activity.

==Origins of the term "charrette"==
The word ''charrette'' is [[French language|French]] for "[[cart]]" or "[[chariot]]." Its use in the sense of design and planning arose in the 19th century at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]], where it was not unusual at the end of a term for teams of student architects to work right up until a deadline, when a charrette would be wheeled among them to collect up their scale models and other work for review. Their continued working furiously to apply the finishing touches came to be referred to as working ''en charrette'', "in the cart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonda|first=Penny|title=Sustainable Commercial Interiors|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smbC2VdZE5MC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Émile Zola]] depicted such a scene of feverish activity, a ''nuit de charrette'' or "charrette night," in ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (serialized 1885, published 1886), his fictionalized account of his friendship with [[Paul Cézanne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gendrat|first=Aurélie|title=Émile Zola, L'Œuvre|year=1999|publisher=Bréal|page=56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5bLDsrgErkC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolved into the current design-related usage in conjunction with working right up until a deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NCI Charrette System|url=http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|publisher=Charrette Institute|accessdate=February 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126100645/http://www.charretteinstitute.org/charrette.html|archivedate=November 26, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--In the 16th, 17th, and 18th century when travel took long periods, a ''charrette'' referred to long carriage rides{{cn}}, in which politicians and policy makers would be sequestered together in order to collaborate in solving a set problem over the duration of their journey. This origin is most similar to the current usage of the word in the design world.--&gt;

==Charrettes in general==

The word ''charrette'' may refer to any collaborative session in which a group of [[designers]] drafts a solution to a design problem.

While the structure of a charrette varies, depending on the design problem and the individuals in the group, charrettes often take place in multiple sessions in which the group divides into sub-groups.  Each sub-group then presents its work to the full group as material for further [[dialogue]]. Such charrettes serve as a way of quickly generating a design solution while integrating the aptitudes and interests of a diverse group of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govanpartick.com/what.html|title=Govan Partick Charrette|website=www.govanpartick.com|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the structure of charrettes may vary, the general idea of a charrette is to create an innovative atmosphere in which a diverse group of stakeholders can collaborate to "generate visions for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2|title=The Design Charrette|last=Roggema|first=Rob|date=2014|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789400770300|editor-last=Roggema|editor-first=Rob|pages=15–34|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-7031-7_2#page-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare this term with [[workshop]].

==Specific cases of charrette==
Charrettes take place in many disciplines, including [[land use planning]], or [[urban planning]].  In planning, the charrette has become a technique for consulting with all [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]].  This type of charrette (sometimes called an enquiry by design) typically involves intense and possibly multi-day meetings, involving [[municipal]] officials, [[real estate developer|developer]]s, and residents.  A successful charrette promotes joint ownership of solutions and attempts to defuse typical confrontational attitudes between residents and developers.  Charrettes tend to involve small groups, however the residents participating  may not represent all the residents nor have the [[moral authority]] to represent them.  Residents who do participate get early input into the planning process.   For developers and municipal officials charrettes achieve community involvement, may satisfy [[Public consultation|consultation]] criteria, with the objective of avoiding costly legal battles.  Other uses of the term "charrette" occur within an academic or [[profession]]al setting, whereas urban planners invite the general public to their planning charrettes.  Thus most people (unless they happen to be design students) encounter the term "charrette" in an urban-planning context.

In fields of [[design]] such as [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[interaction design]], or [[graphic design]], the term ''charrette'' may refer to an intense period of work by one person or a group of people prior to a deadline. The period of a charrette typically involves both focused and sustained effort. The word "charrette" may also be used as a verb, as in, for example, "I am charretting" or "I am on charrette [or: en charrette]," simply meaning I am working long nights, intensively toward a deadline.

An example of a charrette occurred in Florida in 1973 when the future residents of the [[Miccosukee Land Co-op]] in Tallahassee traveled by auto caravan to Orlando and spent the weekend at the offices of the King Helie Planning Group of Orlando (sleeping on the floor) working with its staff to develop the community's land use plans; features desired by individual members and acceptable to the group included a perfectly circular lot, a huge treehouse lot, and streets named after Beatles songs (such as "The Long and Winding Road". "Penny Lane", "Abbey Road"). A more recent example, from [[New College of Florida]], is their Master Plan Design Charrettes that took place over a week in 2005 involving students, alumni, administrators, professors, area residents, and local government staff members as well as architects, designers, and planners from Moule &amp; Polyzoides, The Folsom Group, the Florida House Institute for Sustainable Development, Hall Planning &amp; Engineering, and Biohabitats in a process to make long-range suggestions for the campus layout, landscaping, architecture, and transportation corridors of the master plan for its campus.

In some cases, a charrette may be held on a recurring basis, such as the annual charrette held by the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning department at Utah State University. Each February, the faculty choose a site in partnership with communities and groups throughout Utah, and hold an intense 5-day design charrette focusing on particular issues in that community or region. The charrette begins with a field visit, followed by all-day work sessions accompanied by project stakeholders and volunteer landscape architects and other professionals, and overseen by senior and graduate level students. The final work is then presented to the community. Charrettes such as these offer students and professionals the opportunity to work together in a close setting on real-world design scenarios, and often provide communities with tens of thousands of dollars of design work for free.

The Schools of Architecture at [[Rice University]] and at the [[University of Virginia]] call the last week before the end of classes ''Charrette''.&lt;ref name="Kemmer2008"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Suzanne Kemmer |title=Charrette: Neologisms |url=https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |website=neologisms.rice.edu |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=16 September 2018 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20180916151329/https://neologisms.rice.edu/index.php?a=term&amp;d=1&amp;t=11504 |archivedate=September 16, 2018 |location=Houston, Texas |language=en |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maital2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shlomo Maital|title=Innovate Your Innovation Process: 100 Proven Tools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-exDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA103|year=2016|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4759-95-3|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the final deadline time (assigned by the school), all students must put their "pencils down" and stop working. Students then present their work to fellow students and faculty in a [[critique]]d presentation.

Many municipalities around the world develop long-term city plans or visions through multiple charrettes - both communal and professional.  Notable successes on the west coast of Canada include the city of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, as well as the District of Tofino. Tofino won an Award of Excellence in Planning after a successful multi-day charrette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityspaces.ca/project/tofino-downtown-vitalization-plan/|title=Award-Winning Tofino Downtown Vitalization Plan -|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Civic heraldry''' is [[heraldry]] used by [[municipality|municipalities]].

Cities, towns, boroughs and other civic bodies often use heraldic arms as symbols for themselves and their authority. The traditions differ somewhat from one country to the other, but some similarities can be seen which distinguish all civic heraldry from state or personal heraldry. The most prominent common element is the [[mural crown]], which is used as a sign for a city and its authority in many countries.

The '''cloud swing''' (not to be confused with the '''Mexican cloud swing''') is an aerial act that usually combines static and swinging trapeze skills, drops, holds and rebound lifts.

The apparatus itself is a soft rope about 25-30mm thick. It can be made from a single rope, or from a cotton-filled sheath. On its simplest level the cloud swing resembles a [[Spanish web]] in length and width, with each end braided and spliced-lashed with a thimble, forming a loop. Two high-caliber swivels are required to support the weight; the swivels are anchored to a crane bar or a stationary rig, with the swing itself hanging in a "V" shape. Generally, the motion provided to swing the performer is supplied by an assistant pulling on a tether at the bottom of the "V". "Cloud swing" is often performed at lower altitudes relative to "Mexican cloud swing". This is what distinguished "cloud swing" from "Mexican cloud swing".

The cloud swing is a relatively new apparatus, and many of the figures performed on it are borrowed or adapted from static and swinging [[trapeze]].

The '''Cretto di Burri''' (crack of Burri) or Cretto di Gibellina (crack of Gibellina), also known as "The Great Cretto", is a landscape artwork which undertaken by [[Alberto Burri]] in 1984 and was left in an unfinished state in 1989 (due to lack of funds),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burricentenario.com/home/iniziative-ed-eventi-del-centenario-di-burri/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gibellina.siciliana.it/pages/cretto.html&lt;/ref&gt; based on the old city of [[Gibellina]]. The original city of Gibellina was completely destroyed in the [[1968 Belice earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palinsesti.org/2006/grande-cretto&lt;/ref&gt; Gibellina has since been rebuilt, about 20&amp;nbsp;km from the city's original location.  In 2015 to mark what would have been Burri's one hundredth birthday the work was completed at last.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abitare.it/en/habitat-en/landascape-design-en/2015/11/06/in-gibellina-the-cretto-by-burri-is-finished-after-30-years/?refresh_ce-cp&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is the subject of a short documentary by the Dutch filmmaker Petra Noordkamp which was created as commissioned by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] to be screened at the Alberto Burri retrospective held at the institution from October 9, 2015 until January 6, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://5dutchdaysnyc.org/petra-noordkamp-film-on-il-grande-cretto-di-gibellini/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The site is fully in French, [[German language|German]], and English, with Spanish translations pending as of March 2009.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt; Its purpose is to serve as an artist's initiative and a free online social network for the international arts community.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artslantny"/&gt; The site is designed for emerging and mid-career artists, buyers, collectors, galleries, curators, museums, and art schools to interact as a community.&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt; Members of the public interested in art are encouraged to join as well.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt; Different artist e-spaces can be linked together to create friends and group networks.&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt;

===Operations===

Gila and Dominique Paris are based in [[Luxembourg]], as is site's main office, which is at Rue Basse, 77 L-7307 Steinsel. In 2008 they began working with close friend and curator [[Frank Shifreen]] to open an office in New York City at 290 Elizabeth Street, #1R.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="contactus"/&gt;

In 2010 PRO Services, a professional service for the website's artists that works in connection with an art eCommerce complement, was fully integrated into the platform.&lt;ref name="contactus"/&gt; The service supports an "Art Market Place" where artists can sell original artwork and take orders for "Fine Art Prints" upon demand on museum quality paper.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt; Both the PRO Services and the eCommerce aspects&lt;ref name="contactus"/&gt; are operated by the privately owned company GATE C Sàrl in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;

The site's stated goal is to focus on the Grand Region of the [[European Union]], focusing on supporting and integrating cultural efforts in the EU Member States.&lt;ref name="pieronymus"/&gt; Dominique and Gila Paris, founding members, have served as CultureInside board members since November 2007.&lt;ref name="lulinked"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stateofcreation"/&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Since its inception, CultureInside has used its social platform to organize and curate several exhibits and competitions, with winners premiering their work in high-class galleries and museums through the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="linkedin"/&gt;

CultureInside first organized the show using its base of 3100 online members. 70 pieces of diverse media, including painting, photography, sculpture, digital work, video, and performance, were then chosen by a curatorial committee. The works came from 13 different countries.&lt;ref name="culrtureinside"&gt;{{cite news

The '''Dakar Biennale''', or '''Dak'Art - Biennale de l'Art Africain Contemporain''', is a major [[contemporary art]] exhibition that takes place once every two years in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]]. Dak'Art's focus has been on [[Contemporary African Art]] since 1996.

== History ==
The Dakar Biennale was conceived in 1989 as a [[biennale]] alternating between literature and art. The first edition in 1990 was focused on [[literature]] and in 1992 on [[visual art]]. In 1993 the structure of the biennale was transformed and Dak'Art 1996 became an exhibition specifically devoted to [[Contemporary African Art]]. In 1998 the structure was consolidated and in 2000 there was considerable change: [[Abdoulaye Wade]] was elected president of Senegal a few months before the opening of the event. The new president confirmed the support of the Senegalese government for the event and since 2000, Dak'Art has taken place bi-annually. Dak'Art 2002 was characterized by new staff and new partners. Dak'Art 2004 received more international visitors and wider press coverage; during the opening the president announced his intention to organise a new edition of the [[World Festival of Black Arts]]. For the first time an artistic director was appointed for Dak'Art 2006 and the event was organised with the participation of many artists and a more consistent budget. In 2008 the biennale decelerated. The event took place on a smaller budget and was organised at the last minute. In 2010 the [[European Commission]] - a major financial partner - did not support the event. In December the third edition of the [[World Festival of Black Arts]] was organised in Dakar. The 2014 edition was curated by [[Abdelkader Damani]], [[Elise Atangana]] and [[Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://postcolonialist.com/arts/dakart-2014-crossroads/|title=Dak’art 2014: At a crossroads - The Postcolonialist|website=postcolonialist.com|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 edition was curated by [[Simon Njami]].

Dak'Art is the African continent's longest running grand-scale art event. In 2014, it was opened to non-African nationals for the first time, with the exhibition 'Cultural Diversity' at the IFAN Theodore Monod Museum including invited internationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artthrob.co.za/Feature/The_Dakar_Biennale_2014_by_Olga_Speakes__Anna_Stielau_on_20_June.aspx|title=The Dakar Biennale 2014 by Olga Speakes  Anna Stielau on 20 June {{!}} Artthrob|website=artthrob.co.za|access-date=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firm history==
Founded in 1952 in New York by Sam Brody, Lew Davis, and Chester Wisniewski, Davis, Brody and Wisniewski (now Davis, Brody, and Bond) rose to note by realizing well designed social housing for New York City, such as [[Waterside Plaza]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/nyregion/23davis.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://therealdeal.com/new-research/topics/company/david-brody-bond/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meier |first=Richard |date=1999 |title=Building the Getty |url= |location= |publisher= University of California Press |page=7 |isbn=978-0520217300}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the firm has expanded far beyond its original boundaries, the legacy of quality New York City work to the benefit of New Yorkers is still a keystone of the firm's design philosophy.

The '''Devonshire Hunting Tapestries''' are a group of four magnificent [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[tapestry|tapestries]] dating from the mid-fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Devonshire Hunting Tapestries|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/d/devonshire-hunting-tapestries/|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These enormous works, each over 3 metres wide, depict men and women in [[1400-1500 in fashion|fashionable dress of the early fifteenth century]] [[hunting]] in a [[forest]]. The tapestries formerly belonged to the [[Dukes of Devonshire]], but in 1957 were accepted by HM Government in lieu of tax payable on the estate of the [[10th Duke of Devonshire]] and allocated to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], where they remain. 

The [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire|6th Duke]] described using his 'spare' tapestry to insulate the [[Long gallery|Long Gallery]] at [[Hardwick Hall]] in the 1840s, a practice which saved these rare Gothic hangings from being discarded. The tapestries depict a ''Deer Hunt'', ''Falconry'', a ''Swan and Otter Hunt'' and a ''Boar and Bear Hunt''. The hunt was a particularly powerful theme and would have been a familiar pastime to many of the high-born individuals and families who owned tapestries. Hunting was both a stylized sport and an important source of the only meats considered noble.

This detail is from the ''Boar and Bear Hunt'' Tapestry, made in the 1420s, and shows men carrying special [[boar-spear]]s, which have cross-bars designed to stop the charge of the boar and keep its deadly [[tusk]]s at arms length. Much of the charm of these scenes lies in the elaborate costume detail. The lady crossing the stream on the lower right has 'Monte le Desire' inscribed on her flowing sleeve. This is the opening line of a popular song of the period. The practice of embellishing one's clothes with such words was a medieval equivalent of having a stylish slogan printed on a T-shirt except that, in the tapestry, weaving on a horizontal [[loom]] has reversed the letters.

The dress of the participants is of the type worn at court, particularly that of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], which had control of the tapestry-weaving areas in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|southern Netherlands]]. It is unlikely that any serious hunting took place in such restricting and exotic clothes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Anna|title=V&amp;A: A Hundred Highlights.|year=2001|publisher=V&amp;A Publications|isbn=1-85177-365-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722.jpg|280px|thumb|''Durán Madonna'', c. 1435–38. 100 cm × 52 cm. Oil on oak wood. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. Frame not captured in this reproduction.]] 
'''''Durán Madonna''''' (also known as the '''''Madonna in Red''''' or '''''Virgin and Child in a Niche'''''&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, ix&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Madonna Enthroned''''') is an oil on oak [[panel painting]] completed sometime between 1435 and 1438 by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Netherlandish painter]] [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The painting derives from [[Jan van Eyck| Jan van Eyck's]] ''[[Ince Hall Madonna]]'' and was much imitated subsequently.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"&gt;Panofsky p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Now in the [[Museo del Prado|Prado]], Madrid, it depicts a seated and serene [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] dressed in a long, flowing red robe lined with gold-coloured thread. She cradles the child Jesus who sits on her lap, playfully leafing backwards through a holy book or manuscript on which both figures' gazes rest. But unlike van Eyck's earlier treatment, van der Weyden not only positions his Virgin and Child in a Gothic [[apse]] or [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] as he had his two earlier madonnas (the ''[[Madonna Standing (van der Weyden)|Madonna Standing]]'' and the ''[[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child Enthroned]]''), but also places them on a projecting plinth, thus further emphasising their sculptural impression.&lt;ref name= "Panofsky 259"/&gt;

Christ appears much older than in most contemporary paintings of this kind. He is far from an infant, and is very realistically and physically rendered. He is shown as a small child, with none of the softness of usual 15th-century depictions of the Virgin and Child.&lt;ref name="N146"&gt;Nosow, 146&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is characterised by the sculptural look that van der Weyden often favoured, and for its similarity in colourisation to his c. 1435 ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'' (Madrid) and c. 1442–45 ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' (Berlin).

The painting was acquired by Pedro Fernández-Durán in 1899 at the [[Palace of Infante don Luis (Boadilla del Monte)|Palacio de Boadilla]], Madrid. He donated the work to the [[Museo del Prado]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;

==Description==
Mary is shown in a long, red, hooded robe and white headdress, with the Child Jesus in a white shirt seated on her lap. He curiously leafs through and crumples the pages of a book perched on his mother's knee. The book is placed at the very center of the panel, symbolising the centrality of the divine Word in Christian belief.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; According to the Prado, the book itself represents an allusion to the "Holy Scriptures that announce Christ's redemptive mission."&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;"[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/online-gallery/on-line-gallery/obra/virgin-and-child-1/ Virgin and Child]". [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 13 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An angel in dark grey dress hovers above Mary's head, holding a pearl-encrusted crown destined for her upon her assumption as [[Queen of Heaven]].&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; Mary's long robe swirls around the pictorial space, obscuring her throne and eventually falling at the support by her feet.&lt;ref name="N146" /&gt; They are framed by a sculpted [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] or apse with Gothic [[tracery]] similar to that found in van der Weyden's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''.&lt;ref name="N145"&gt;Nosow, 145&lt;/ref&gt; The curved arches of the niche echo the lines of her figure as she bends protectively over the child. These curved lines and warm colours give the work its sense of internal harmony.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - Prado P02722 (Detail).jpg|thumb|250px|left|Detail showing the restless child leafing through the parchments of the holy book.]]
Art-historical analysis in the early to mid 20th century placed little emphasis on Christ's older age for a "Virgin and Child" work of this period. Nor did it emphasise the significance of the manuscript or the rough manner in which Christ seems to energetically leaf through it, his play watched on by a near-indulgent&lt;!--hm--&gt; Mary. More recently, art historians such as [[Alfred Acres]] have questioned the significance of the child's freedom of movement and naturalistic portrayal in such a deliberately elegant and poised work—especially in the work of such a self-aware and compositionally involved painter as van der Weyden. Acres believes that the book is central to the understanding of the painting, and notes its perfect centrality in the panel; it is the focus of both figures' gazes and hands, and Christ is apparently leafing ''backwards'' through the pages, towards the beginning.&lt;ref name="A77"&gt;Acres, 77&lt;/ref&gt; While Christ's right hand holds a number of parchments scrunched together and he pays no attention to them, his more careful left hand is about to open the lower left corner of the open page. If it is reasonably assumed that the book held open on Mary's lap is facing towards her, it seems the child is leafing backwards through the pages. While holy books were often included in 15th-century northern depictions of the Virgin, they were usually associated with the idea of the Virgin as a representation of learning or wisdom; in no other contemporary painting are they turned through with such restless energy, not to mention being turned through from end to beginning.&lt;ref name="A79"&gt;Acres, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Acres suggests that the infant Christ is leafing back towards [[Book of Genesis|Genesis: 3]] describing the [[Fall of Man]], citing three other works where van der Weyden similarly articulates the [[Redemption (theology)|redemptive theme]], including the '' Madonna Standing'' panel in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] where the Madonna is flanked by figures of Adam and Eve.&lt;ref name= "A90"&gt;Acres, 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Panofsky 261"&gt;''c.f.'' Panofsky p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Virgin and Child (Durán Madonna) - detail2.jpg|thumb|290px|Detail showing the dark winged angel hovering under the Niche holding the crown above Mary's head.]]
Art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] believes the painting was influenced by [[Robert Campin]]'s Frankfurt ''[[commons:File:Robert Campin - Virgin and Child - WGA14434.jpg|Virgin and Child]]'' both in [[ideal of feminine beauty|the ideal of feminine beauty]] it presents and for its elegant use of long folded draperies. Campbell notes that both works are composed from strong diagonal lines, with the main figures pushed out into the center foreground, in an almost [[trompe-l'œil]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 19&lt;/ref&gt; 
The ''Durán Madonna'' is often compared to van der Weyden's ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'', both for the colourisation of Mary's dress and for a sculptural look similar to the reliefs shown in the earlier triptych. In addition, the underdrawing of Mary's head is strikingly similar to that of the kindly, idealised Madonna in his ''Froimont Diptych'' (after 1460), now in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand et al., 259&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these strong similarities, attribution to van der Weyden is not doubted, although the work is known to have been frequently copied in Spain after it was relocated there&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; sometime in the 16th century.

The black overpaint behind the Virgin was probably added at the request of a later 18th-century seller, most likely in an attempt to fashion the piece as a genre work and downplay its religious theme. Research aided by X-ray has been inconclusive and has found no lost detail or drawing beneath the thick layers of paint.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell, 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusionary devices==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait Diptych of Laurent Froimont (left wing) - WGA25697.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Left wing of van der Weyden's ''Froimont Diptych'', after 1460. [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Caen]].]]

Van der Weyden often depicted lifelike and voluminous figures set in shallow sculptural spaces, in which they seemed cramped and larger than scale. The space filled by the figures is undefined and ambiguously located. Mary and the child are supported by a projecting [[corbel]], the three-dimensionality of which gives the disorienting impression that the figures are part of a [[relief]] in a much larger work of art. This gives the work a dizzying and dislocated perspective; its own unique sense of space and placement.&lt;ref&gt;Nosow, 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is an early example of van der Weyden's habit of rendering his figures with the appearance of [[polychrome]] sculptures, an effect here accentuated by the neutral background.&lt;ref name="prado" /&gt; Van der Weyden's tendency to blur the line between sculpture and paint in an illusionistic manner can be see most effectively in his  ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]''. Art historian Robert Nosow notes the architectural aspect of the gothic frame, and the manner in which the lines of the Virgin and child make them seem as if statues come to life.&lt;ref name="N145" /&gt; Art historian Shirley Neilsen Blum writes that the faux sculptural elements, "force[s] the viewer to continually confront the seemingly real presence of two media, sculpture and painting&amp;nbsp;... Rogier defies logic and therefore enhances the magical quality of the image. Divinity is stressed because it has transcended media definition."&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 103&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Future Anterior''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[University of Minnesota Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pillars of Preservation |url=http://www.traditionalbuildingportfolio.com/profiles/commercial/pillars.html |publisher=Traditional Building Portfolio |accessdate=1 February 2016 |author=Kim A. O'Connell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Jorge Otero-Pailos]] ([[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation]]).

==History==
The journal was established in 2004 by Jorge Otero-Pailos and is dedicated to the "critical examination of historic preservation."&lt;ref&gt;Liz Holmes, "Alumnus Starts Preservation Journal," in Cornell College of Architecture, Art and Planning Newsletter (Fall 2004): 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Future Anterior |url=https://www.upress.umn.edu/journal-division/journals/future-anterior |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal's title is a reference to the grammatical tense, [[Future perfect|futur antérieur]], and is an allusion to the field of historic preservation as "concerned both with what has not yet happened (future) and what has already happened (anterior)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Screen/Print 27: Future Anterior, a Champion of Historic Preservation |url=http://archinect.com/features/article/115813747/screen-print-27-future-anterior-a-champion-of-historic-preservation |publisher=Archinect |accessdate=1 February 2016 |author=Amelia Taylor-Hochberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
In addition to its primary focus on [[historic preservation]] history, theory, and criticism, it also includes essays on various topics including "art, philosophy, law, geography, archeology, [[Urban planning|planning]], [[materials science]], cultural anthropology, and [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Columbia GSAPP Future Anterior |url=http://www.arch.columbia.edu/programs/historic-preservation/future-anterior |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each issue contains articles, an exhibition review, a feature piece, a book review, and an artist intervention.

==Impact==
At its establishment, Otero-Pailos said that the journal "signals the maturation of the field of preservation and a shift…towards an active involvement in the understanding and creative transformation of human environments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ConsDistList New Journal Future Anterior |url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/2004/0587.html |publisher=Conservation Online |author=Judy Jacob |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Future Anterior'' also provides a forum for discussion of the field of preservation and architecture and influenced the 2006-2007 student architect competition, ''Preservation as Provocation: Re-designing [[Saarinen]]'s [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]]'' in Michigan, that "called on students to address a complex set of criteria that roughly broke down as engagement, program, time, and technology, prompted by the theory of historic provocation suggested by Otero-Pailos's writings in the journal that he edits, Future Anterior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Preservation as Provocation |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1531-314X.2007.00151.x/full |journal=[[Journal of Architectural Education]] |author=Sharon Haar |volume=61 |issue=2 |pp=60–65 |date=November 2007 |subscription=yes|doi=10.1111/j.1531-314X.2007.00151.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giclée''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|iː|ˈ|k|l|eɪ}} {{respell|zhee|KLAY}}) is a [[neologism]] [[Coined term|coined]] in&amp;nbsp;1991 by [[Printmaking|printmaker]] Jack Duganne for [[fine art]] [[Digital printing|digital prints]] made on [[inkjet printer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dq3Xj8zEYMIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=giclee+prints+produced+on+epson#PPA11,M1 ''Mastering Digital Printing'', p.11] at Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; The name originally applied to fine art prints created on a modified [[Iris printer]] in a process invented in the late 1980s. It has since been used loosely to mean any fine-art, most of the times archival, inkjet print. It is often used by artists, galleries, and print shops to suggest high quality printing but since it is an unregulated word it has no associated warranty of quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wjKzHzemCxAC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;dq=giclee+inkjet+printer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VcjtT46XGOiT0QH3vZWHDg&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=giclee%20inkjet%20printer&amp;f=false Robert Hirsch, Greg Erf, Exploring Color Photography: From Film to Pixels, page 201]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The word ''giclée'' was adopted by Jack Duganne around 1990. He was a printmaker working at [[Graham Nash#Nash Editions|Nash Editions]]. He wanted a name for the new type of prints they were producing on a modified [[Iris printer]], a [[Large format (photography)|large-format]], [[Image resolution|high-resolution]] industrial [[prepress proofing]] inkjet printer on which the paper receiving the ink is attached to a rotating drum and that they had adapted for fine-art printing. He was specifically looking for a word that would differentiate them from regular commercial IRIS prints then used as proofs in the commercial printing industry. "Giclée" is based on the [[French language|French]] word ''gicleur'', the French technical term for a jet or a nozzle, and the verb coming from it "gicler" (to squirt out). "Une giclée" (noun) means a spurt of some liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. "What's In a Name: The True Story of Giclée", dpandi.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casselman |first=Bill |url=http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |title=Giclée |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731171334/http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harald"&gt;Johnson, Harald, Mastering Digital Printing, Second Edition, Thomson Course Technology - 2005, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[verb]] form ''gicler'' means to spray, spout, or squirt. It describes the movement of a liquid that is suddenly under violent pressure and has only got a tiny hole to exit the compressed space in which it is. Duganne settled on the [[noun]] ''giclée''. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Harald. "What's In a Name: The True Story of Giclée", dpandi.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Daniel. [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-01-25/entertainment/9901250193_1_giclee-ink-jet-prints-jet-printer "Ink-jet art runs gamut from low brow to high class"], Baltimore Sun&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Casselman |first=Bill |url=http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |title=Giclée |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731171334/http://www.billcasselman.com/unpublished_works/giclee.htm |archivedate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current usage ==

Besides its original association with Iris prints, the word ''giclée'' has come to be somewhat loosely associated with other types of [[inkjet printing]] including processes that use dyes or fade-resistant, archival inks ([[pigment]]-based), and archival substrates primarily produced on [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Epson]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and other large-format printers.&lt;ref&gt;Luong, Q.-Tuan. [http://www.largeformatphotography.info/digital-printing.html An overview of large format color digital printing] at largeformatphotography.info&lt;/ref&gt; These printers use the [[CMYK]]&amp;nbsp; (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black) color process as a base but may have other added color [[Ink cartridge|cartridges]] for better color or black and white rendition (such as light [[magenta]] and light [[cyan]], light and very light gray, even orange and green (Epson) inks in addition to regular cyan, magenta yellow and black inks); these improve the apparent color [[gamut]] and allow smoother gradient transitions and more accurate colors.&lt;ref&gt;Vandsburger, Judith. [http://www.signindustry.com/digital/articles/2003-01-31-NUR-8colorDigitalPrinting.php3 "8-Color Printing: What’s Hype and What’s Real?"], signindustry.com&lt;/ref&gt; A wide variety of [[Substrate (printing)|substrates]] on which an image can be printed with such inks are available, including various textures and finishes such as matte [[Photographic paper|photo paper]], [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] paper, cotton [[canvas]], pre-coated canvas, or artist textured vinyl.

== Applications ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}

Artists generally use inkjet printing to make reproductions of their original two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated art]]. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the four-color [[Offset printing|offset lithography]] process traditionally used for such reproductions. (A large-format inkjet print can cost more than&amp;nbsp;$50, not including scanning and [[color correction]], compared to $5 for a four-color offset litho print of the same image in a run of 1,000.) Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having to be set up and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not have to pay for the expensive printing plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. This allows the artist to follow a [[just in time (business)|just-in-time]] business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used. As a result numerous individual artists own and operate their own printers.

'''''Harold and the Purple Crayon''''' is a 1955 [[Children's literature|children's book]] by [[Crockett Johnson]]. This is Johnson's most popular book. It led to a series of other books, and inspired many adaptations.

==Plot==
The protagonist, Harold, is a curious four-year-old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Harold and The Purple Crayon Climbs to #1 in iPad Book App Chart in First Week of Release|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/harold-and-the-purple-crayon-climbs-to-1-in-ipad-book-app-chart-in-first-week-of-release-127225038.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=April 24, 2014|author=Trilogy Studios|date=August 8, 2011|quote=This timeless classic by Crockett Johnson is about the world a curious four-year-old boy creates by simply drawing it with a purple crayon.}}&lt;/ref&gt; boy who, with his [[purple]] [[crayon]], has the power to create a world of his own simply by drawing it.

Harold wants to go for a walk in the moonlight, but there is no moon, so he draws one. He has nowhere to walk, so he draws a path. He has many adventures looking for his room, and in the end he draws his own house and bed and goes to sleep.

==Adaptations==
The original story was adapted by [[Weston Woods Studios]] and [[Brandon Films]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bcdb title|57945|Harold and the Purple Crayon (1959)}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a seven-minute [[short film]] in 1959, directed by [[David Piel]] and narrated by [[Norman Rose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksu.ksu.edu/english/nelp/purple/film.html#harold_and_others.video |title=Crockett Johnson Homepage: Film and Video |publisher=Ksu.ksu.edu |date=2005-08-03 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1219760|Harold and the Purple Crayon (1959)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Gene Deitch]] directed an animation of ''A Picture for Harold's Room'', and in 1974 an animation of ''Harold's Fairy Tale''. In 1993, these three animations were packaged with a documentary, and sold as the ''Harold and the Purple Crayon and Other Harold Stories'' set.

There have also been theater adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2008/09/24/harold-and-the-purple-crayon/ |title=Harold and the Purple Crayon |publisher=DC Theatre Scene |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsoinc.com/family/artist.php?artist=harold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213004752/http://www.bsoinc.com/family/artist.php?artist=harold|date=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[couch gag]] for the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[The Bob Next Door]]", Harold is shown drawing the Simpson family living room during the regular title sequence. Homer also asks Harold to draw him a can of beer after he finishes with the living room.

In 2011, the story was adapted as an interactive book for the [[iPad]] by [[Trilogy Studios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/harold-and-the-purple-crayon/id450829541?mt=8 |title=iTunes Store |publisher=itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the protagonists in ''[[Captain Underpants]],'' Harold Hutchins, is named after the protagonist in the book, along with George Beard being named after the protagonist in ''[[Curious George]].''

In Rob Reiner's 1999 romantic comedy ''[[The Story of Us (film)|The Story of Us]]'', Kate (Michelle Pfeiffer) says that ''Harold and the Purple Crayon'' is one of her favorite books and an allegory for her marriage with Ben (Bruce Willis). She later explains that Ben just wouldn't "share the crayon," and that she feels she has been living in ''his'' world rather than one she had helped create.

'''Jenny Gilbertson''' (born '''Jenny Brown'''; 28 October 1902&lt;ref name=Shetland&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tayor|first1=Marsali|title=Lights, Camera, Action… Reestit Mutton!|url=http://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2012/02/07/lights-camera-action-reestit-mutton|website=The Shetland Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; – 8 January 1990) was a Scottish documentary and educational filmmaker.&lt;ref name=Shetland /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Jenny Gilbertson was born on 28 October 1902, in [[Glasgow, Scotland]]; the only daughter of Mary Dunn Wright, and an iron merchant, William Brown.&lt;ref name=BioDic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pipes|first1=editors, Elizabeth Ewan, Sue Innes, Siân Reynolds ; co-ordinating editor Rose|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women From the Earliest Times to 2004|date=2006|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0748626603}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied at Laurel Bank School, then furthered her education at [[Glasgow University]] where she earned an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in teaching.&lt;ref name=BioDic /&gt;&lt;ref name = AboutJenny&gt;{{cite web|title=Jenny Gilbertson: A Biography|url=https://jennygilbertsonbiography.wordpress.com/about-jenny-gilbertson/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her relationship with films started after she went to London for a secretarial course in journalism in 1929.&lt;ref name=Library&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wade|first1=Anne|title=Biography of 'Gilbertson, Jenny Isabel (nee Brown)|url=http://movingimage.nls.uk/biography/10013|publisher=National Library of Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; She concluded that educational and documentary style filmmaking was for her after she saw an amateur film about the Scottish [[Loch Lomond]] in London; which resulted in her purchasing her first 16mm camera.&lt;ref name=BioDic /&gt;

Gilbertson chose Shetland as her first subject as she had been taken there by her family as a child.&lt;ref name="wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-jenny-gilbertson/|title=Jenny Gilbertson – Women Film Pioneers Project|website=wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbertson met native Shetlander farmer Johnny Gilbertson while filming one of her earlier films, ''Rugged Island: A Shetland Lyric (1933)'', where Gilbertson played the lead in the story-documentary film. They married shortly after the completion of the film, in 1934.&lt;ref name=BioDic /&gt; She experienced a halt in her filmmaking career until the 1960s, due to the birth of her and her husbands two daughters, the distant location of [[Shetland]], and [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=Pioneer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walber|first1=Daniel|title=5 Women Documentary Pioneers You Should Know|url=http://nonfics.com/5-women-documentary-pioneers-know/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after retiring from a teacher position that she entered her second phase of filmmaking.

==Career==
Following her purchase of a 16mm camera, Gilbertson went to the archipelagos of [[Shetland]] in 1931. This is when she made her first film ''A Crofter's Life in Shetland'' and invited Scottish documentary maker [[John Grierson]] to watch it.&lt;ref name=Library /&gt; Grierson was impressed with her work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/drouth/docs/the_event_which_is_in_front_of_her_/1|title=Jenny Brownrigg: The event which is in front of her eyes|website=Issuu|access-date=2016-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and supported her by encouraging her to purchase a more advanced camera. She then purchased a 35mm [[Eyemo]], and made five more films in [[Shetland]]; all of which Grierson bought for the [[GPO Film Unit]] (General Post Office Film Unit).&lt;ref name=Shetland /&gt; Following which Gilbertson toured Britain and Canada, lecturing on her film ''The Rugged Island: A Shetland Lyric''.&lt;ref name=Library /&gt; She made one film with [[Evelyn Spice Cherry]], ''Prairie Winter'',&lt;ref name="wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu"/&gt; (1934).

During her hiatus after the lecture tours, the Gilbertsons ran a small hosiery business in their hometown of [[Shetland]] in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=BioDic /&gt; Later in 1947 Jenny Gilbertson accepted a temporary teaching position at the local Urafirth Primary School, which turned her supposed temporary employment into two decades.&lt;ref name=BioDic /&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutJenny /&gt; However, she revisited filmmaking after retiring from teaching in 1967, and returned to Canada soon after, where she made films for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Company]].&lt;ref name=BioDic /&gt; The revival of her filmmaking career was largely due to her husband's sudden death earlier in the year.&lt;ref name=AboutJenny /&gt;
Ideally returning to filmmaking in the 1970s, Gilbertson spent vast lengths of time in Arctic Canada producing some of her last works. ''People of Many Lands'', ''Jenny's Arctic Diary: Part I and II'', and ''Walrus Hunt'' were some of her later films that were sold to British and Canadian broadcasters, including the [[Canadian Museum of History]].&lt;ref name=AboutJenny /&gt; She also made a further film about Shetland, ''People of Many Lands- Shetland'' with [[Elizabeth Balneaves]], which was broadcast by the BBC in October 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Women: From the earliest times to 2004.|last=Pipes|first=Rose|last2=Ewan|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Innes|first3=Sue|last4=Reynolds|first4=Sian|first5=|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780748632930|location=|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the films Gilbertson had made during her filmmaking career were focused on embracing nature, farming life, fishing, families that did such activities and anything that captured the environment she was in.&lt;ref name=Shetland /&gt;

'''''Judith and Holofernes''''' (1457–1464)&lt;ref&gt;Kevin R. Brine, Elena Ciletti, Henrike Lähneman, ''The Sword of Judith: Judith Studies Across the Disciplines, Open Book Publishers, 2010, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[bronze sculpture]] created by the Italian [[Renaissance]] sculptor [[Donatello]] at the end of his career. It can be seen in the Hall of Lilies (Sala dei Gigli), in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence]], Italy. A copy stands in one of the sculpture's original positions on the [[Piazza della Signoria]], in front of the Palazzo Vecchio.

It depicts the assassination of the Assyrian general [[Holofernes]] by [[Judith]] and is remarkable for being one of the first Renaissance sculptures to be conceived in the round, with its four distinct faces. The subject of [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], depicting the climax of the story in the deuterocanonical [[Book of Judith]], was a common subject in art and is associated with the [[Power of Women]] topos.

==Background and description==
The statue was commissioned by [[Cosimo de' Medici]] as a decoration for the fountain in the garden of the [[Palazzo Medici|Palazzo Medici-Riccardi]]. Together with Donatello's ''[[David (Donatello)|David]]'', it was positioned in front of the palace around 1457, when Cosimo de' Medici's extended family decided to move into it.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, Sarah Blake. "Donatello's Bronze "David" and "Judith" as Metaphors of Medici Rule in Florence." ''The Art Bulletin'' 83, no. 1 (March 2001): 32-47. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3177189.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the exact place where these two were displayed is unknown, both of these statues became a symbol for the power Florence possessed.

''Judith and Holofernes'' depicts Judith standing powerfully with a raised sword, holding the head of Holofernes by his hair. The statue was originally gilded; some gilding remains on the sword. To facilitate the gilding the bronze was cast in 11 parts. The base of the sculpture resembles a [[cushion]], a naturalistic device first used by Donatello for his ''[[St. Mark (Donatello)|St. Mark]]'' in the [[Orsanmichele]]. Intended to function as a fountain, this statue sits on a triangular pedestal with holes for water to flow through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Florence|date=1952|publisher=Hollis &amp; Carter|edition=2|location=London|pages=53–54|last1=Hutton|first1=Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism of Judith ==
Both [[Judith]] and [[David]] are underdogs from [[Old Testament]] stories, and are also seen placed in close proximity in the fresco of [[Santa Maria Antiqua]] as well as on [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]'s East Baptistry Doors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=3177189|title=Donatello's Bronze "David" and "Judith" as Metaphors of Medici Rule in Florence on JSTOR|language=en|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith is considered the symbol of liberty, virtue and victory of the weak over the strong in a just cause. Christian symbolism of Judith reveals her actions over Holofernes to be a victory of virtue, particularly concerning self-control, chastity and humility, as opposed to promiscuity and pride.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Her story in the [[Power of Women]] topos depicts the weak overcoming the assumed victor in an effort to protect her home. This is symbolic of the city of Florence, who fought to protect their [[Republic of Florence]] from foreign powers and to the Medici specifically upholding their pride in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Donatello|last=B. Bennett and D. Willkins|first=|publisher=|year=1984|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=231–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The anticipated slashing of the general's neck and overall notion of beheading is emphasized visually in the statue through Judith's intent gaze and strongly cocked arm wielding her blade ready to strike. In addition, carved into Holofernes' back, is a medallion structured to appear hanging from his neck has been historically known as a symbol of pride.&lt;ref&gt;H. Kauffmann, Donatello. Eine Einfuhrung in sein Bilden und Denken, Berlin, 1936, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars believe that in this instance the necklace is direct symbolism of pride evidenced by Psalms 73:6, which states, "the wicked wear pride like a necklace and violence wraps them round."&lt;ref&gt;V. Herzner, "Die 'Judith' de Medici," ''Zeitschrift fur Kunstgeschichte'' XLIII pp.154&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that the statue is meant to be viewed from the side rather than straight on. By viewing from an angle, the emphasis is on Holofernes' neck, flanked by both of Judith's legs underneath her garments, and is the center of attention as Judith pulls her arm back to strike. This would render the inscription "Behold the neck of pride served by the hand of humility" the most accurately depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crum|first=Roger J.|year=2001|title=Severing the Neck of Pride: Donatello's "Judith and Holofernes" and the Recollection of Albizzi Shame in Medicean Florence|jstor=1483711|journal=Artibus et Historiae|volume=22| issue =  44|pages=23–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that an inscription on the granite pedestal originally read, "Kingdoms fall through luxury [sin], cities rise through virtues. Behold the neck of pride severed by the hand of humility." This dramatic and detailed statue is thus a [[metaphor]] of the [[Medici]] rule, as the defenders of Florentine liberty, akin to Judith, slayer of the tyrant [[Holofernes]] and defender of the people.  This view is supported by accounts that mention a second inscription on the pedestal which read, "The salvation of the state. Piero de' Medici son of Cosimo dedicated this statue of a woman both to liberty and to fortitude, whereby the citizens with unvanquished and constant heart might return to the republic." Inscribed on the cushion are the words &lt;small&gt;OPVS . DONATELLI . FLO&lt;/small&gt; (the work of the Florentine, Donatello).

== Placement ==
In 1495, the sculpture was placed on the Piazza della Signoria, at the side of main door the Palazzo Vecchio, in memory of the expulsion of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici]] from Florence and the introduction of the Florentine republic under [[Girolamo Savonarola]]. This time, this statue symbolized the expulsion of the tyrannical Medici. The statue was later moved to the courtyard inside the Palazzo Vecchio, and still later into the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]]. In 1919, it was then placed on the left side of the Palazzo Vecchio. It was replaced by a bronze copy in 1988 and the original, after restoration, was given a final place in the Sala dei Gigli inside the Palazzo Vecchio.

'''La Scala''' ({{IPA-it|la ˈskaːla|pron}}; abbreviation in [[Italian language]] for the official name '''{{lang|it|Teatro alla Scala}}''' {{IPA-it|teˈaːtro alla ˈskaːla|}}) is an [[opera house]] in [[Milan]], Italy. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and was originally known as the ''{{lang|it|Nuovo Regio Ducale Teatro alla Scala}}'' (New Royal-Ducal Theatre alla Scala). The premiere performance was [[Antonio Salieri]]'s ''[[Europa riconosciuta]]''.

Most of Italy's greatest operatic artists, and many of the finest singers from around the world, have appeared at La Scala. The theatre is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in the world and is home to the La Scala Theatre Chorus, [[La Scala Theatre Ballet]] and La Scala Theatre Orchestra. The theatre also has an associate school, known as the La Scala Theatre Academy ({{lang-it|Accademia Teatro alla Scala|links=no}}), which offers professional training in music, dance, stage craft and stage management.

==Overview==
[[File:Milano-scalanotte e.jpg|thumb|300px|The Teatro alla Scala in Milan, by night]]
La Scala's season opens on 7 December, [[Saint Ambrose]]'s Day, the feast day of Milan's [[patron saint]]. All performances must end before midnight, and long operas start earlier in the evening when necessary.

The [[Museo Teatrale alla Scala]] (La Scala Theatre Museum), accessible from the theatre's foyer and a part of the house, contains a collection of paintings, drafts, statues, costumes, and other documents regarding La Scala's and opera history in general. La Scala also hosts the Accademia d'Arti e Mestieri dello Spettacolo (Academy for the Performing Arts). Its goal is to train a new generation of young musicians, technical staff, and dancers (at the [[Scuola di Ballo del Teatro alla Scala]], one of the Academy's divisions).

==History==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}&lt;!--6 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
[[File:XIX century print, Piazza della Scala, Milano.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A nineteenth-century depiction of the Teatro alla Scala]]
A fire destroyed the previous theatre, the [[Teatro Regio Ducale]], on 25 February 1776, after a [[carnival]] gala. A group of ninety wealthy Milanese, who owned private boxes in the theatre, wrote to Archduke [[Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este|Ferdinand of Austria-Este]] asking for a new theatre and a provisional one to be used while completing the new one. The [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architect [[Giuseppe Piermarini]] produced an initial design but it was rejected by Count Firmian (the governor of the then Austrian [[Lombardy]]).

A second plan was accepted in 1776 by Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]. The new theatre was built on the former location of the church of [[Santa Maria alla Scala, Milan|Santa Maria alla Scala]], from which the theatre gets its name. The church was deconsecrated and demolished and, over a period of two years, the theatre was completed by Pietro Marliani, Pietro Nosetti and Antonio and Giuseppe Fe.
The theatre had a total of "3,000 or so" seats&lt;ref&gt;Beauvert, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; organized into 678 pit-stalls, arranged in six tiers of boxes above which is the 'loggione' or two galleries. Its stage is one of the largest in Italy (16.15m d x 20.4m w x 26m h).

Building expenses were covered by the sale of boxes, which were lavishly decorated by their owners, impressing observers such as [[Stendhal]]. La Scala (as it came to be known) soon became the preeminent meeting place for noble and wealthy Milanese people. In the tradition of the times, the main floor had no chairs and spectators watched the shows standing up. The orchestra was in full sight, as the orchestra pit had not yet been built.

Above the boxes, La Scala has a gallery—called the ''loggione''—where the less wealthy can watch the performances. The gallery is typically crowded with the most critical opera aficionados, known as the loggionisti, who can be ecstatic or merciless towards singers' perceived successes or failures. For their failures, artists receive a "[[baptism of fire]]" from these aficionados, and fiascos are long remembered. For example, in 2006, tenor [[Roberto Alagna]] was booed off the stage during a performance of ''[[Aida]]''. This forced his [[understudy]], [[Antonello Palombi]], to quickly replace him mid-scene without time to change into a costume.

As with most of the theatres at that time, La Scala was also a [[casino]], with gamblers sitting in the foyer.&lt;ref name="mallach"&gt;Mallach 2007, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions in the auditorium, too, could be frustrating for the opera lover, as [[Mary Shelley]] discovered in September 1840:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At the Opera they were giving [[Otto Nicolai]]'s ''[[Il templario|Templario]]''. Unfortunately, as is well known, the theatre of La Scala serves, not only as the universal drawing-room for all the society of Milan, but every sort of trading transaction, from horse-dealing to stock-jobbing, is carried on in the pit; so that brief and far between are the snatches of melody one can catch.&lt;ref&gt;Shelley 1844, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
La Scala was originally illuminated with 84 oil lamps mounted on the stage and another thousand in the rest of theatre. To prevent the risks of fire, several rooms were filled with hundreds of water buckets. In time, oil lamps were replaced by gas lamps, these in turn were replaced by electric lights in 1883.
[[File:Milano Teatro alla Scala Postkarte 001.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Interior of the opera house in 1900]]
The original structure was renovated in 1907, when it was given its current layout with 1,987 seats. In 1943, during [[World War II]], La Scala was severely damaged by bombing. It was rebuilt and reopened on 11 May 1946, with a memorable concert conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]]—twice La Scala's principal conductor and an associate of the composers [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]]—with a soprano solo by [[Renata Tebaldi]], which created a sensation.

La Scala hosted the first productions of many famous operas, and had a special relationship with Verdi. For several years, however, Verdi did not allow his work to be played here, as some of his music had been modified (he said "corrupted") by the orchestra. This dispute originated in a disagreement over the production of his ''[[Giovanna d'Arco]]'' in 1845; however the composer later conducted his ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' there on 25 May 1874 and he announced in 1886 that La Scala would host the premiere of what was to become his penultimate opera, ''[[Otello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley 2004, p. 317&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere of his last opera, ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' was also given in the theatre.

In 1982, the Filarmonica della Scala was established, drawing its members from the larger pool of musicians that comprise the Orchestra della Scala.

==Recent developments==

===Major renovation, 2002 to 2004===
[[File:Milano scala piazza.jpg|thumb|300px|The exterior of La Scala in 2005 after the 2002/04 renovations]]
The theatre underwent a major renovation from early 2002 to late 2004. The theatre closed following the traditional 7 December 2001 season opening performances of ''Otello'', which ran through December. From 19 January 2002 to November 2004, the opera company transferred to the new [[Teatro degli Arcimboldi]], built in the Pirelli-Bicocca industrial area {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} from the city centre.

[[File:Teatro alla Scala interior Milan.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The theatre's restored interior]]
The renovation by [[architect]] [[Mario Botta]] proved controversial, as preservationists feared that historic details would be lost. However, the opera company was satisfied with the improvements to the structure and the sound quality, which was enhanced when the heavy red carpets in the hall were removed. The stage was entirely rebuilt, and an enlarged backstage allows more sets to be stored, permitting more productions.

Seats now include monitors for the [[Electronic libretto| electronic libretto system]] provided by [[Radio Marconi]], an Italian company, allowing audiences to follow opera libretti in English and Italian in addition to the original language.

The opera house re-opened on 7 December 2004 with a production, conducted by [[Riccardo Muti]], of [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri's]] ''[[Europa riconosciuta]]'', the opera performed at La Scala's inauguration in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2004/11/05/lascalareopen041105.html| title=La Scala revamp finished early| date=5 November 2004| newspaper=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets for the re-opening fetched up to €2,000.&lt;ref name=BBC_fires_official&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4297413.stm| title=La Scala board fires top official| date=25 February 2005| newspaper=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The renovations cost a reported €61 million, and left a budget shortfall that the opera house overcame in 2006.&lt;ref name=BBC_fires_official /&gt;

===Management controversies and changes, 2005 onward===
[[File:Barenboim Vienna.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daniel Barenboim]]]]
Carlo Fontana, the general manager of La Scala since 1990, was dismissed in February 2005 by the board of governors over differences with the music director, [[Riccardo Muti]]. The resulting staff backlash caused serious disruptions and staff strikes. In a statement, the theatre's board said it was "urgent to unify the theatre's management." On 16 March 2005, the La Scala orchestra and other staff overwhelmingly approved a no-confidence motion against Muti, and demanded the resignation of Fontana's replacement, Mauro Meli. Muti had already been forced to cancel a concert a few days earlier because of the disagreements. Italy's culture minister, [[Giuliano Urbani]], supported the conductor but called for urgent action by management to safeguard the smooth operation and prestige of La Scala. On 2 April 2005, Muti resigned from La Scala, citing "hostility" from staff members.

In May 2005, [[Stéphane Lissner]], formerly head of the [[Aix-en-Provence Festival]], was appointed General Manager and Artistic Director of La Scala, becoming the first non-Italian in its history to hold the office. On 15 May 2006, [[Daniel Barenboim]] was named ''Maestro Scaligero'', or ''de facto'' principal guest conductor, of the company. In October 2011, Barenboim was appointed the next music director of La Scala, effective December 2011, with an initial contract of 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Barenboim to head La Scala| url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/classical-music-news/barenboim-to-head-la-scala| work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]| location=London| date=14 October 2011| accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, management named [[Riccardo Chailly]] the next music director of La Scala, effective 1 January 2015.&lt;ref name=Chailly&gt;[http://www.gramophone.co.uk/classical-music-news/riccardo-chailly-to-be-la-scalas-new-music-director It's official: Riccardo Chailly to be La Scala's new music director], ''Gramophone'' (London). 10 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stéphane Lissner left La Scala for the [[Paris Opera]]. His successor {{Interlanguage link multi|Alexander Pereira|de}}, formerly director of the [[Salzburg Festival]], began his tenure on 1 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Alexander Pereira to Begin La Scala Tenure in October 2014, Year Earlier Than Originally Announced| url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2013/7/News/Pereira_to_La_Scala_2014.html| work=[[Opera News]]| date=19 July 2013| accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Scala will host the opening ceremony of the [[134th IOC Session]] in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-elects-milan-as-host-of-the-ioc-session-in-2019 IOC ELECTS MILAN AS HOST OF THE IOC SESSION IN 2019]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Literary property''' is a term used in [[publishing]] to refer to works generally covered by [[copyright]] but also an associated set of [[property rights]] that go far beyond what courts have historically permitted to be claimed as [[copyright infringement]].

The [[Writers Guild of America]], for instance, uses this term exclusively to refer to works registered with its [[WGA script registration service]], so as not to restrict the claims it or its users can make regarding their rights.

==Narrower than "intellectual property"==
Since it applies only to literary works and not technological or social constructs such as are covered by [[patent]] or [[trademark]] law, the term is much narrower in scope than the hotly contested term "[[intellectual property]]" sometimes used to refer to all non-physical works in which property rights are recognized.

==Differences between literary property and other non-physical property==
Among other differences, in literary works a very specific concept of [[:wikt:attribution|attribution]] is a critical part of the work itself - works tend to become markedly less valued or more valued based upon who originated or created it, which is simply not the case for [[invention]]s or [[brand name]]s.  Also, most countries recognize [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] that are not [[alienable]] from the work, that is, a purchaser of rights in the work does not have the right to relabel it as if someone else had written it.  While the USA does not recognize moral rights, it does have complex de facto standards such as the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] which are actually more demanding and rigorous in specific industries.

'''Live Arts Week'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveartsweek.it Live Arts Week]&lt;/ref&gt; is a project by Xing, born in 2012 out the fusion of the experiences of the two Bologna festivals (2000&gt;2011): [[Netmage]] - International Live Media Festival and [[F.I.S.Co.]] - Festival Internazionale sullo Spettacolo Contemporaneo.
Live Arts Week takes place in [[Bologna]], Italy, once a year, and it is developed throughout one week in different locations and settings in town.

==Mission==

Event dedicated to live arts, it hosts a blend of artworks and productions that revolve around the presence, performance and perceptual experience of sounds and visions, with a program of live works (performances, environments, concerts, live media, expanded cinema) presented by important personalities in the international and contemporary research scene. The set-up suggests a citywide event, involving several spaces, organizations and institutions active in the field of contemporary arts in Bologna.

'''Léon Bakst''' ({{lang-ru|Леон (Лев) Николаевич Бакст}}, Leon (Lev) Nikolaevich Bakst) – born as '''Leyb-Khaim Izrailevich''' (later '''Samoylovich''') '''Rosenberg''', Лейб-Хаим Израилевич (Самойлович) Розенберг (27 January (8 February) 1866&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/izobrazitelnoe_iskusstvo/BAKST_LEV_SAMOLOVICH.html БАКСТ, ЛЕВ САМОЙЛОВИЧ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article090753.html Бакст Лев Самойлович]&lt;/ref&gt; – 28 December 1924) was a [[Russia]]n [[Painting|painter]] and [[Scenic design|scene]] and [[costume design]]er. He was a member of the [[Sergei Diaghilev]] circle and the [[Ballets Russes]], for which he designed exotic, richly coloured [[Set construction|sets]] and [[costume]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D1%82/%D0%91%D0%A1%D0%AD/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%81%D1%82%20%D0%9B%D0%B5%D0%B2%20%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B9%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87/ Леон Бакст]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
[[File:Léon Samoilovitch Bakst in 1916.jpg|thumb|Bakst in 1916]]
Leyb-Khaim Izrailevich (later Samoylovich) Rosenberg was born in [[Grodno]] (now in [[Belarus]]), into a middle-class Jewish family. As his grandfather was an exceptional tailor, the Tsar gave him a very good position, and he had a huge and wonderful house in Saint Petersburg{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}. Later, when Leyb's parents moved to the capital, the boy Leyb would visit his grandfather's house every Saturday. He said that he had been very impressed as a youth by that house, always returning with pleasure.  At the young age of twelve, Lejb won a drawing contest and decided to become a painter, but his parents did not approve of this. 

After graduating from [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], he studied at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts|St. Petersburg Academy of Arts]] as a noncredit student, because he had failed the entry. He also worked part-time as a book illustrator, gaining admission into the Imperial Academy in 1883.

At the time of his first exhibition (1889) he took the surname of "Bakst," based on his mother's maiden name. The surname "Rosenberg" was thought to be "too Jewish" and not good for business. At the beginning of the 1890s, Bakst exhibited his works with the Society of [[Watercolour]]ists. From 1893 to 1897 he lived in Paris, where he studied at the [[Académie Julian]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=D1G37Ko49DcC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Acad%C3%A9mie+Julian&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjOrYikkcHPAhXIVhQKHVKdCSo4HhDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Acad%C3%A9mie%20Julian&amp;f=false Bakst]&lt;/ref&gt; He still often visited [[Saint Petersburg]]. After the mid-1890s, Bakst became a member of the circle of writers and artists formed by [[Sergei Diaghilev]] and [[Alexandre Benois]],&lt;ref name="k"&gt;[http://pv-gallery.ru/artist.php?i=231&amp;letter=%CE Бакст Л. С.]&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1899 founded the influential periodical ''[[Mir iskusstva]],'' meaning "World of Art." His graphics for this publication brought him fame.

== Rise to fame ==
Bakst continued painting, producing portraits of [[Filipp Malyavin]] (1899), [[Vasily Rozanov]] (1901), [[Andrei Bely]] (1905), [[Zinaida Gippius]] (1906). He also worked as an art teacher for the children of [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia]]. In 1902, he took a commission from [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] to paint ''Admiral Avellan and Russian sailors meeting'' in Paris, a painting he started there, during the celebrations from the 17 to 25 October 1893. However, it took him 8 years to finish this work. 

In 1898, he showed his works in the Diaghilev-organized ''First Exhibition of Russian and Finnish Artists''; in ''World of Art'' exhibitions, as well as the [[Munich]] ''[[Sezession|Secession]],'' exhibitions of the ''Union of Russian Artists'', etc.

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Bakst worked for the magazines ''Zhupel'', ''Adskaja Pochta'', and ''Satyricon'', then for an art magazine called ''Apollon.''

Beginning in 1909, Bakst worked mostly as a stage-designer, designing [[Set construction|sets]] for [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]]. In 1908, he gained attention as a scene-painter for [[Diaghilev]] with the [[Ballets Russes]].  He produced scenery for ''Cleopatra'' (1909), ''[[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]]'' (1910), ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'' (1910), ''Narcisse'' (1911), ''[[Le Spectre de la Rose]]'' (1911), ''[[Afternoon of a Faun (Nijinsky)|L'après-midi d'un faune]]'' (1912) and ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'' (1912).&lt;ref name =Remsen&gt;Thomas J Mikotowicz  "Bakst, Léon" in Thomas J Mikotowicz, ''Theatrical designers: and International Biographic Dictionary. ''New York: Greenwood, 1992 {{ISBN|0313262705}}. p.17&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Bakst lived in western Europe because, as a Jew, he did not have the right to live permanently outside the [[Pale of Settlement]] in the Russian Empire.

During his visits to Saint Petersburg, he taught in ''Zvantseva's school,'' where one of his students was [[Marc Chagall]] (1908–1910). Bakst described Chagall as a favorite, because when told to do something, he would listen carefully, but then he would take his paint and his brushes and do something completely different from the assignment. 

In 1914, Bakst was elected a member of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]].

In 1922, Bakst broke off his relationship with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes. During this year, he visited [[Baltimore]] and, specifically [[Evergreen Museum &amp; Library|Evergreen House]] - the residence of his American friend and patron, art philanthropist Alice Warder Garrett (1877–1952). Having met in Paris in 1914, when Mrs. Garrett was accompanying her diplomat husband in Europe, Bakst soon depended upon Garrett as both a confidante and agent. Alice Garrett became Bakst's representative in the United States upon her return home in 1920, organizing two exhibitions of the artist's work at New York's [[Knoedler Gallery]], as well as subsequent traveling shows.  When in Baltimore, Bakst re-designed the dining room of Evergreen into a shocking acidic yellow and 'Chinese' red confection.  The artist transformed the house's small c. 1885 gymnasium into a colorfully Modernist private theatre. This is believed to be the only extant private theatre designed by Bakst.

Bakst died on 27 December 1924, in a clinic in Rueil Malmaison, near Paris, from [[lung]] problems ([[pulmonary edema|oedema]]).  His many admirers amongst the most famous artists of the time, poets, musicians, dancers and critiques, formed a funeral procession to accompany his body to his final resting place, in the Cimetière des Batignolles, in Paris, during a very moving ceremony.&lt;ref name="k"/&gt;

In late 2010, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London presented an exhibit of Bakst's costumes and prints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/theatre_performance/features/Costume/1739_Designers_Speak/1739_Leon_Bakst/index.html |title=Biography of Léon Bakst - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411070131/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/theatre_performance/features/Costume/1739_Designers_Speak/1739_Leon_Bakst/index.html |archivedate=2009-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_Netherlands.svg|thumb|The [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|arms of the Dutch monarch]] feature a pavilion and mantle]]

In heraldry, the '''mantle''' is a symbol of sovereign power and is generally reserved for royalty. In some cases its use has also been granted to other nobles, in recognition of particular merits. In ordinary rendering the mantle is usually crimson and lined with ermine. Certain arms may also display a '''pavilion''' surmounting the mantle.

The pavilion is said to be the invention of the Frenchman Philip Moreau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox-Davies|first1=Arthur Charles|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|date=1909|publisher=T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack|location=London &amp; Edinburgh|page=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While common in continental European heraldry, the mantle and pavilion is absent in British heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox-Davies|first1=Arthur Charles|title=A Complete Guide to Heraldry|date=1909|publisher=T.C. &amp; E.C. Jack|location=London &amp; Edinburgh|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Megalopsychia Hunt of Antioch''' are two floor [[mosaic]]s from the late fifth to early sixth century, part of a large group of mosaics known collectively as the [[Antioch mosaics]]. They were discovered at the ancient village of Yakto, near Daphne, a suburb of [[Antioch]], near the modern city of [[Antakya]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="bmcr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=John R.|title=Review of: Antioch: The Lost Ancient City. Exhibition catalogue, Worcester Art Museum, October 7, 2000-February 4, 2001; The Cleveland Museum of Art, March 18-June 3, 2001; The Baltimore Museum of Art, September 16-December 30, 2001|url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2001/2001-01-07.html|website=Bryn Mawr Classical Review|accessdate=10 December 2017|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are representative of the trait or virtue of ''megalopsychia'', which has been interpreted to mean arrogance or the belief of superiority and being worthy of great things and respect.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Glanville|date=1945|title=The Pagan Virtue of Megalopsychia in Byzantine Syria|url=|journal=[[Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association]]|volume=76|pages=279–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the mosaics depicts a medallion with a woman holding a rose in one hand with scenes of animals attacking each other, then an outer ring surrounding it of six scenes of hunters taking down their prey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The mosaics are highly allegorical and carry deep symbolism that operates on multiple levels.  One interpretation of these scenes is that they represent not only the strength of those depicted, but courage and the subjugation of the natural world by the ruler.  It is a way of showing the assertion of order, bounty, and, above all, the victory or triumph of mankind over nature. Another interpretation would be that the female figure in the center is the representation of serenity of mind and logic, she is serene and undisturbed despite the violence surrounding her.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Glanville|date=1941|title=Ethical Themes in the Antioch Mosaics|url=|journal=[[Church History (journal)|Church History]]|volume=10|pages=367–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The battles surrounding her show the various rises and falls of human society, the wars they wage, the victories won and the defeats suffered.

The other mosaic has a lead male figure in a hunting scene where he is killing a lion, with men and horses fighting animals around him.  He remains detached in much the same way the female figure was in the other medallion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  One is accepting the world around her and the other is subjugating it to his will, both are apparently unaffected by the actions happening around them because they are meant to be above it. This detachment of the mind and spirit from turmoil is part of the ideal behind the virtue of ''megalopsychia.''

''Iran (Lonely Planet Country Guide)''. p. 114. Lonely Planet Publications, 5th Edition, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-74104-293-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located between [[Qarb Town]] and the district of [[Gisha]], standing at 435 meters from the base to the tip of the antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cellular-news.com/story/34027.php |publisher=Cellular-News |title=Iran Opens World's 4th Highest Telecoms Tower |accessdate=2009-10-05 |date=2009-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The head consists of a large pod with 12 floors, the roof of which is at 315 meters.

The tower is a part of the International Trade and Convention Center of Tehran, which also includes a five-star hotel, a convention center, a world trade center and an IT park.&lt;ref name="skyscraper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iitk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt;

==History==
===Background===
The Milad Tower was part of the Shahestan Pahlavi project, a vast development for a new government and commercial centre for Tehran, that was designed in the 1970s but never materialized, except for the Tower. After an international competition, the project was awarded to the [http://www.ldavies.com/home-slider/shahestan-pahlavi-iran/ Llewely Davies] Company, and construction was inaugurated on August 19, 1975, with the Shah of Iran and the Mayor of Tehran Dr G.R. Nickpay burying a commemorative gold plaque .&lt;ref&gt;Shahestan Pahlavi. Book 1: The Master Plan. Llewely Davies, 1976 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
{{see also|Construction industry of Iran}}
The construction of the tower was commenced in 1997. Upon completion of its construction in the mid 2000s, the Milad Tower was considered the [[List of tallest towers|fourth-tallest freestanding telecommunication tower in the world]].&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt; While the tower opened in 2007, numerous conflicts on the history of the tower still prevail, partly because sections of the tower were open to visitors once the elevators started operating during construction and the tower was still far from finished.&lt;ref name="skyscraper"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iitk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt;

The design of the project was headed by Iranian architect Mohammad Reza Hafezi. The general contractor was the company of Boland Payeh, and the main client and investor was the company of Yadman Sazeh, a representative of the Municipality of Tehran.&lt;ref name="iitk"/&gt;

The tower was officially opened on February 20, 2009 by the 55th [[Mayor of Tehran]], [[Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf]], and members of the [[Islamic City Council of Tehran|City Council of Tehran]]. More than 250 local and foreign journalists were covering the event.

==Structure and features==

[[File:Tallest towers in the world.svg|thumb|250px|The Milad Tower among the [[List of tallest towers|world's seven tallest towers]].]]

Milad Tower is {{convert|435|m|ft}} tall and is the tallest tower in Iran, and the [[List of tallest towers in the world|sixth-tallest telecommunication tower]] in the world. It consists of five main parts, including the foundation, transition (lobby) structure, shaft, head structure and the antenna mast.

The lobby structure consists of six floors. The first three floors consist of 63 trade units, 11 food courts, a cafeteria, and a commercial products exhibition which is supposed to be about {{convert|260|sqm}}.&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt; The first and second underground floors consist of installing sections and a data center. The ground floor is dedicated to the entrance and the gatehouse.

[[File:Miladtower elevator.ogv|thumb|Inside one of the elevators of the Milad Tower.]]
The shaft is a [[concrete]] structure about {{convert|315|m|ft}} high from the ground floor. Six elevators in three different sides of the shaft are used to transfer the visitors to the head of the tower at the speed of {{convert|7|m/s|km/s}}, besides an emergency staircase at the fourth side.

The head of the tower is a steel structure weighing about 25,000 tonnes and consisting of 12 floors. The top floors of the tower include a public art gallery, a cafeteria, a [[revolving restaurant]], a VIP restaurant, telecommunication floors, [[mechanical floor]]s, fire-immune areas built as a refuge zone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iuatehran2009.ir/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=42 |publisher=IUA |title=Congress Venue |accessdate=2009-10-05 |date=2009-03-13 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a closed observation deck, an open observation deck, and a sky dome.&lt;ref name="iitk"/&gt;

The four-stage antenna mast is about {{convert|120|m|ft}} high. The lower floor of the mast is for the adjustment of public users' telecommunication antennas, and the three upper floors are dedicated to the antenna of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name="iitk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt;

The complex also features a parking area of about {{convert|27,000|sqm}}, a large computer and telecommunications unit, a cultural and scientific unit, a commercial transaction center, a temporary showroom for exhibiting products, a specialized library, an exhibition hall, and an administrative unit.

The Milad Tower has an octagonal base, symbolizing traditional [[Iranian architecture]].&lt;ref name="iitk"/&gt;

[[File:Jean + Brigitte Soubeyran Im Zirkus.JPG|thumb|200px|Mime artists Jean Soubeyran and Brigitte Soubeyran in 1950]]
A '''mime''' or '''mime artist'''  (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μῖμος, ''mimos'', "imitator, actor")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmi%3Dmos μῖμος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; is a person who uses mime as a theatrical medium or as a [[performance art]]. Miming involves acting out a story through body motions, without the use of [[speech]]. In earlier times, in English, such a performer would typically be referred to as a [[mummer]]. Miming is distinguished from [[silent comedy]], in which the artist is a seamless character in a film or sketch.

[[Jacques Copeau]], strongly influenced by [[Commedia dell'arte]] and Japanese [[Noh]] theatre, used masks in the training of his actors. His pupil [[Étienne Decroux]] was highly influenced by this, started exploring and developing the possibilities of mime, and developed [[corporeal mime]] into a highly sculptural form, taking it outside the realms of naturalism. [[Jacques Lecoq]] contributed significantly to the development of mime and [[physical theatre]] with his training methods.&lt;ref name=Callery&gt;{{cite book

==History==
=== In Western theatre traditions ===
The performance of mime originates at its earliest in [[Ancient Greece]]; the name is taken from a single masked dancer called ''Pantomimus'', although performances were not necessarily silent. In Medieval Europe, early forms of mime such as [[Mummers Play|mummer play]]s and later [[dumbshow]]s evolved. In early nineteenth-century Paris, [[Jean-Gaspard Deburau]] solidified the many attributes that have come to be known in modern times—the silent figure in whiteface.

==== Greek and Roman mime ====
{{Main|Ancient Greek comedy}}
[[File:PANTOMIME-PABLO.jpg|thumb|200px|Mime Pablo Zibes]]
The first recorded mime was Telestēs in the play ''[[Seven Against Thebes]]'' by [[Aeschylus]]. Tragic mime was developed by Puladēs of Kilikia; comic mime was developed by Bathullos of Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Lust, Annette. [https://www.mime.info/history-lust.html "The Origins and Development of the Art of Mime".] ''From the Greek Mimes to Marcel Marceau and Beyond: Mimes, Actors, Pierrots and Clowns: A Chronicle of the Many Visages of Mime in the Theatre''. 9 March 2000. Retrieved 14 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Theatre of ancient Rome#Roman comedy}}
Mime (Mimius) was an aspect of Roman theatre from its earliest times,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/mime-and-pantomime Mime and pantomime]&lt;/ref&gt; paralleling the [[Atellan farce]] in its improvisation (if without the latter’s stock characters).&lt;ref name="nettle 393"&gt;H Nettleship ed., ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (London 1894) p. 393&lt;/ref&gt; It gradually began to replace the Atellanae as interludes [embolium] or postscripts [exodium] on the main theatre stages;&lt;ref&gt;H J Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1967) p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; became the sole dramatic event at the [[Floralia]] in the second century BC; and in the following century received technical advances at the hands of [[Publius Syrus]] and [[Decimus Laberius]].&lt;ref name="nettle 393"/&gt;

Under the Empire mime became the predominant Roman drama,&lt;ref name="nettle 393"/&gt; if with mixed fortunes under different emperors.  [[Trajan]] banished mime artists; [[Caligula]] favored them; [[Marcus Aurelius]] made them priests of [[Apollo]]. [[Nero]] himself acted as a mime.&lt;ref&gt;Broadbent, R. J. (1901) [http://www.mime.info/history-broadbent.html#2HCH0006 ''A History of Pantomime'', Chapter VI.] London. Retrieved 14 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mime was distinguished from other dramas by its absence of masks, and by the presence of female as well as male performers. &lt;ref&gt;H J Rose, ''A Handbook of Latin Literature'' (London 1967) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Stock characters included the lead (or archimimus[a]), the stooge or stupidus,&lt;ref name="nettle 393"/&gt; and the [[gigolo]], or cultus adulter.&lt;ref&gt;G Highet, ''Juvenal the Satirist'' (Oxford 1962) p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In non-Western theatre traditions ===
While most of this article has treated mime as a constellation of related and historically linked Western theatre genres and performance techniques, analogous performances are evident in the theatrical traditions of other civilizations.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Classical Indian musical theatre]], although often erroneously labeled a "dance," is a group of theatrical forms in which the performer presents a narrative via stylized gesture, an array of hand positions, and mime illusions to play different characters, actions, and landscapes. Recitation, music, and even percussive footwork sometimes accompany the performance. The [[Natya Shastra]], an ancient treatise on theatre by [[Bharata Muni]], mentions silent performance, or ''mukabhinaya''.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

In [[Kathakali]], stories from Indian epics are told with facial expressions, hand signals and body motions. Performances are accompanied by songs narrating the story while the actors act out the scene, followed by actor detailing without background support of narrative song.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

The Japanese [[Noh]] tradition has greatly influenced many contemporary mime and theatre practitioners including [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Jacques Lecoq]] because of its use of mask work and highly physical performance style.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

[[Butoh]], though often referred to as a dance form, has been adopted by various theatre practitioners as well.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Formats==
=== In film ===
[[File:Chaplin A Dogs Life.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[A Dog's Life]]'' (1918), [[Charlie Chaplin]]]]
Prior to the work of [[Étienne Decroux]] there was no major treatise on the art of mime, and so any recreation of mime as performed prior to the twentieth century is largely conjecture, based on interpretation of diverse sources.  However, the twentieth century also brought a new [[Mass media|medium]] into widespread usage: the motion picture.

The restrictions of early motion picture technology meant that stories had to be told with minimal dialogue, which was largely restricted to [[intertitle]]s.  This often demanded a highly stylized form of physical acting largely derived from the stage.  Thus, mime played an important role in films prior to advent of [[talkies]] (films with sound or speech).  The mimetic style of film acting was used to great effect in [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] film. 

[[Silent film]] comedians like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Harold Lloyd]], and [[Buster Keaton]] learned the craft of mime in the theatre, but through film, they would have a profound influence on mimes working in live theatre decades after their deaths.  Indeed, Chaplin may be the best-documented mime in history.

The famous French comedian, writer, and director [[Jacques Tati]] achieved his initial popularity working as a mime, and indeed his later films had only minimal dialogue, relying instead on many subtle expertly choreographed visual gags.  Tati, like Chaplin before him, would mime out the movements of every single character in his films and ask his actors to repeat them.

===On stage and street===
[[File:Mimes in Boston.jpg|thumb|Whitefaced mime on Boston Common in 1980]]
Mime has been performed on stage, with [[Marcel Marceau]] and his character "Bip" being the most famous.  Mime is also a popular art form in [[street theatre]] and [[busking]].  Traditionally, these sorts of performances involve the actor/actress wearing tight black and white clothing with white facial makeup.  However, contemporary mimes often perform without whiteface.  Similarly, while traditional mimes have been completely silent, contemporary mimes, while refraining from speaking, sometimes employ vocal sounds when they perform. Mime acts are often comical, but some can be very serious.

On the stage, Mime Artist [[Nithor Mahbub]] from Bangladesh introduced the first practice of teaching through humor with group Mimo Drama troupe Mime Art. 

=== In literature ===
Canadian author Michael Jacot's first novel, ''The Last Butterfly'', tells the story of a mime artist in Nazi-occupied Europe who is forced by his oppressors to perform for a team of Red Cross observers.&lt;ref&gt;Broyard, Anatole. "A Laugh Before Dying." ''The New York Times''. 7 March 1974. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel laureate [[Heinrich Böll]]'s ''The Clown'' relates the downfall of a mime artist, Hans Schneir, who has descended into poverty and drunkenness after being abandoned by his beloved.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, Daniel. "Without Shmerz." ''The New York Times''. 4 January 1965. Book Review. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Appel's Pushcart short-listed story, "Coulrophobia", depicts the tragedy of a landlord whose marriage slowly collapses after he rents a spare apartment to an intrusive mime artist.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bellevue Literary Review]]'', Vol 5, No. 2, Fall 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nobar bath''' is one of the historical baths of [[Tabriz]], Iran. It was constructed in the centre of the city near the Nobar gate, one of the old gates of Tabriz. Nobar bath, which covers an area about 700 sq. metres, was used as a public bath until 1994. Its ruins have been restored by Cultural Heritage Organization of [[East Azarbaijan Province]] and registered as part of Iran's National Heritage.

==Architectural plan==
Like the other baths in [[Iran]], Nobar bath has a narrow passage, Sar-beena (where people dressed and undressed), heating centre, water pool and [[Garm-Khaneh]] (washing part) which ornamented with brick and tile works. Moreover there were some private bath rooms called [[Shah-neshin]] for royal families.

==Restoration==

The restoration of Nobar bath has lasted for 6 years. After restoration it equipped and turned to traditional restaurant divided to tree parts and [[tea]] house. In the upstairs [[Kebabs]] and other local foods and sweets are served.

[[Image:Delaunay-Windows.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Robert Delaunay]], ''Simultaneous Windows on the City'', 1912, [[Kunsthalle Hamburg]]]]
'''Orphism''' or '''Orphic Cubism''', a term coined by the French [[poetry|poet]] [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in 1912, was an offshoot of [[Cubism]] that focused on pure [[abstraction]] and bright colors, influenced by [[Fauvism]], the theoretical writings of [[Paul Signac]], [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] and the dye chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul|Eugène Chevreul]]. This movement, perceived as key in the transition from Cubism to [[Abstract art]], was pioneered by [[František Kupka]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Sonia Delaunay]], who relaunched the use of color during the monochromatic phase of Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/o/orphism Tate Glossary] retrieved 31 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of the term Orphism was elusive when it first appeared and remains to some extent vague.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 Museum of Modern Art, New York, Hajo Düchting, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:František Kupka - Katedrála - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|240px|upright|[[František Kupka]], ''[[The Cathedral (Katedrála)|Katedrála (The Cathedral)]]'', 1912-13, oil on canvas, 180 x 150 cm, [[Museum Kampa]], [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
The Orphists were rooted in [[Cubism]] but moved toward a pure [[lyrical abstraction]], seeing painting as the bringing together of a sensation of pure colors. More concerned with the expression and significance of sensation, this movement began with recognizable subjects but was rapidly absorbed by increasingly abstract structures. Orphism aimed to dispense with recognizable subject matter and to rely on ''form'' and ''color'' to communicate meaning. The movement also aimed to express the ideals of Simultanism: the existence of an infinitude of interrelated states of being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/s/simultanism Tate glossary] Retrieved December 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The decomposition of spectral light expressed in [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory of [[Paul Signac]] and [[Charles Henry (librarian)|Charles Henry]] played an important role in the formulation of Orphism. [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Albert Gleizes]], and [[Gino Severini]], all knew Henry personally.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Henry, a mathematician, inventor, esthetician, and intimate friend of the Symbolist writers [[Félix Fénéon]] and [[Gustave Kahn]], met [[Georges Seurat|Seurat]], Signac and [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]] during the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. Henry would take the final step in bringing ''emotional associational theory'' into the world of artistic sensation: something that would influence greatly the Neo-Impressionists. Henry and Seurat were in agreement that the basic elements of art—the line, particle of color, like words—could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. "Seurat knows well" wrote Fénéton in 1889, "that the line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an assessable abstract value" in addition, of course, to the particles of color, and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by the likes of Robert Delaunay.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt; Indeed, the Neo-Impressionists had succeeded in establishing an objective scientific basis for their painting in the domain of color. The Cubists were to do so in both the domain of form and dynamics, and the Orphists would do so with color too.

The Symbolists had used the word ''orphique'' in relation to the Greek myth of [[Orpheus]], who they perceived as the ideal artist. Apollinaire had written a collection of quatrains in 1907 entitled ''Bestiaire ou cortège d’Orphée'' (Paris, 1911), within which Orpheus was symbolized as a poet and artist. For both Apollinaire and the Symbolists who preceded him, Orpheus was associated with [[mysticism]], something that would inspire artistic endeavors. ''The voice of light'' that Apollinaire mentioned in his poems was a metaphor for ''inner experiences''. Though not fully articulated in his poems, ''the voice of light'' is identified as a line that could be colored and become a painting. The Orphic metaphor thus represented the artist’s power to create new structures and color harmonies, in an innovative creative process that combined to form a sensuous experience.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==Guillaume Apollinaire==
[[File:Sonia Delaunay, 1914, Prismes électriques, oil on canvas, 250 x 250 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Sonia Delaunay]], 1914, ''Prismes électriques'', oil on canvas, 250 x 250 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]], [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris]]
The term Orphism was coined by poet and art critic [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912, referring to the works of [[František Kupka]]. During his lecture at the Section d'Or exhibit Apollinaire presented three of Kupka's abstract works as perfect examples of ''pure painting'', as anti-figurative as music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cubist_Painters.html?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Cubist Painters (Les Peintres Cubistes: Méditations esthétiques)'', Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913, translation by Peter Read, University of California Press, 25 oct. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations|Les Peintres Cubistes, Méditations Esthétiques]]'' (1913) Apollinaire described Orphism as "the art of painting new totalities with elements that the artist does not take from visual reality, but creates entirely by himself. [...] An Orphic painter's works should convey an ''untroubled [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] pleasure'', but at the same time a ''meaningful structure and sublime significance''. According to Apollinaire Orphism represented a move towards a completely new art-form, much as music was to literature. Orphic painters cited analogies with music in their titles; for example, Kupka’s ''Amorpha: Fugue in Two Colors'' (1912) and [[Francis Picabia]]’s abstract composition ''Dance at the Source'' (1912) and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]’s ''Über das Geistige in der Kunst'' (1912). Kandinsky's detailed theoretical essays described the correlations between color and sound. Robert Delaunay, also preoccupied with relations between color and music, highlighted the purity and independence of color, and successfully exhibited with the [[Blaue Reiter]] at the invitation of Kandinsky. [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], as they tended towards abstraction, were also included as Orphists in the writings of Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

Apollinaire stayed with the Delaunays during the winter of 1912, becoming close friends and elaborating on many ideas. Apollinaire wrote several texts discussing their work to promote the concept of Orphism. In March 1913 Orphism was exhibited to the public at the Salon des Indépendants. In his review of the Salon published in ''L’Intransigeant'' (25 March 1913), Apollinaire wrote that ‘it combines painters of totally different characters, all of whom have nonetheless achieved a more internalized, more popular and more poetic vision of the universe and of life’. And in ''Montjoie'' (29 March 1913) Apollinaire argued for the abolition of Cubism in favour of Orphism: ‘If Cubism is dead, long live Cubism. The kingdom of Orpheus is at hand!’

The Herbst salon (Erster Deutscher Herbstsalon, Berlin) of 1913, organized by [[Herwarth Walden]] of [[Der Sturm]], exhibited many works by Robert and Sonia Delaunay, [[Jean Metzinger]]’s ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]'' (1913, Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris), [[Albert Gleizes]]' ''[[Les Joueurs de football]]'' (1912-13, National Gallery of Art), paintings by Picabia, and Léger, along with several Futurist paintings. This exhibition marked a turning-point in Apollinaire’s relation with R. Delaunay (which would cool markedly), following some remarks in an argument with [[Umberto Boccioni]] about the ambiguity of the term ‘simultaneity’.  This would be the last time Apollinaire used the term Orphism in his critical analyses of art; as he turned his attention increasingly towards Picabia and [[Alexander Archipenko]], but most of all towards the Futurists.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

==The Delaunays==
[[Sonia Terk Delaunay]] and [[Robert Delaunay]], a husband and wife duo, were to become the main protagonists of the Orphic movement, Robert Delaunay also studied different styles of painting, such as Abstract Art. In their earlier works, their styles focused on Fauvist colors with various degrees of abstraction; particularly evident in Sonia's ''Finnish Girl'' (1907) and Robert's ''Paysage au disque'' (1906). The former painting relies heavily on bright colors and smooth transitions between forms, while the latter relies on color and mosaic-like brushstrokes painted under the influence of Jean Metzinger, also a Neo-Impressionist (with highly [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] and [[Fauvism|Fauve]] components) at the time.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert" /&gt;

Their works became increasingly identifiable by the 'simultaneous' contrasting of colors and the tendency towards non-representation. In Robert's ''Eiffel Tower Series'', the subject is portrayed as if seen from several viewpoints at once; employing the concept of 'mobile perspective' developed by his close friend Metzinger. Soon, instead of using muted tones as the Cubists, he would paint with bold, bright colors juxtaposed one next to the other (a concept derived from [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] color theory). He often portrayed the tower with reds and pinks with cooler colors throughout. The more Robert painted the tower, the more abstract, fragmented and colorful it became.

In 1913 the Delaunays showed their works in the [[Société des Artistes Indépendants|Salon des Indépendants]] and the Herbst Salon, the latter being the first Orphist Salon, which also hosted works by [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger|Léger]], and [[Futurism|Futurist]] painters. Unlike others associated with Orphism, the Delaunays would return to this style throughout their lives.

==Eugène Chevreul==
[[Image:Transsiberien.jpg|thumb|right|The last section of ''[[La prose du Transsibérien et de la Petite Jehanne de France]]'', 1913, a collaborative [[Artist's book|artists' book]] by [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Sonia Delaunay-Terk]].]]
One of Robert's biggest influences, besides his wife, was the chemist [[Eugène Chevreul]]. Most famous for discovering [[margarine]], Chevreul delved in dye chemistry as well as the aesthetics of [[contrast effect|simultaneous contrast]] of colors. He had three main ideas to his color theories: "when complementary colors are juxtaposed, each appears to be more intense than when seen in isolation" and "if there is a perceptible difference in dark-light value between the two colors, then the darker will appear to be even darker" as well as that "all colors present in the field of vision at the same time mutually modify one another in specific ways". Chevreul influenced many artists because he understood scientifically what many artists expressed instinctively.

==After 1913==
Even after Apollinaire had separated from the Delaunays and Orphism had lost its novelty as a new art form, the Delaunays continued painting in their personal shared style. They may not have always called their work Orphic, but the aesthetics and theories were the same. Robert continued painting while Sonia delved into other media, including fashion, interior and textile design, all within the realm of Orphism.

==Legacy==
Orphism as a movement was short-lived, essentially coming to an end before [[World War I]]. In spite of the use of the term the works categorized as Orphism were so different that they defy attempts to place them in a single category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;displayall=1#skipToContent Christopher Green, 2009, Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; Artists intermittently referred to as Orphists by Apollinaire, such as Léger, Picabia, Duchamp and Picasso, independently created new categories that could hardly be classified as Orphic. The term Orphism most obviously embraced paintings by František Kupka, Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, if limited to implications imposed by color, light, and the expression of non-representational compositions. Even Robert Delaunay thought this description misrepresented his intentions, though his temporary classification as Orphic had proved successful. The American painters [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Arthur Burdett Frost]], two of Delaunay’s pupils, strove to create a similar art-form circa 1912. The [[Synchromism|Synchromists]] [[Morgan Russell]] and [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]] wrote their own manifestos in an attempt to distance themselves from the Orphism of Robert Delaunay, but their art at times inevitably appeared Orphic. Essentially a stylistic sub-category of [[Abstract art]] created by Apollinaire, Orphism was an elusive term from which artists included within its scope persistently attempted to detach themselves.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt;

A '''paintings conservator''' is an individual responsible for protecting [[cultural heritage]] in the form of painted works of art. These individuals are most often under the employ of [[museums]], [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] centers, or other cultural institutions.  They oversee the physical care of collections, and are trained in chemistry and practical application of techniques for repairing and restoring paintings.

==Responsibilities and duties==

===Collaboration===
A paintings conservator works with a number of museum professionals to ensure painted works of art receive the best quality of care.  This individual may be called upon by a Registrar/Collections Manager (RCM) in the event of an emergency, such as accidental damage.  A paintings conservator may also be called upon to consult with the RCM and an [[exhibition]] design team to ensure a work is stable enough for display, and determine how much exposure to environmental factors, such as humidity or light, it can withstand.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, R. A., &amp; Gilmore, J. A. (2010). MRM5: Museum registration methods (5th ed.). Washington, DC: AAM Press, American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventive care===
Preventive care is the abating of potential deterioration and damage to a painting through previously designated policies and procedures surrounding the object's storage and handling.

====Emergency preparedness====

Emergency preparedness and an emergency plan are crucial pieces to have in place for a museum.  It informs conservators, RCMs, and all other museum personnel how to respond to disasters that may strike their institution, and therefore its collections.  These plans can be expansive, detailing a number of procedures for different contingencies, such as fire, flooding, and even war.  Protective measures in an emergency plan should include prevention through risk management, preparedness and response training, and recovery arrangements.  An institution should know which staff member's are delegated to a project during a given circumstance, and be able to tell them how they will assess and move forward with the help of an emergency plan.&lt;ref&gt;Dorge, V., &amp; Jones, S. L. (1999). Building an emergency plan: A guide for museums and other cultural institutions. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Conservation Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integrated pest management (IPM)====
{{Main|Museum integrated pest management}}

Integrated pest management (IPM) is the strategy used by a museum to handle pests such as mold, insects, or mice.  An IPM program may address structural and environmental issues that contribute to the pest problem.  This could include preventing initial entry of pests into the structure through building maintenance, moderating the interior climate, and setting up an insect monitoring system.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology. (n.d.). Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Retrieved from https://peabody.harvard.edu/node/275.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like an emergency plan, IPM can be time-consuming and require a number of responsibilities from each staff member.  However, if pests do become an issue for a single painting or the entire museum, an IPM system will be helpful to have in place.  Prevention is a key part of IPM, as chemical pesticides and fumigants can also be harmful to collections.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins Arenstein, R., Duncan, N., Elkin, L., Monk, R., &amp; Norris, C. (2008).

====Storage, handling, and loan travel====

Inter-museum loans can put paintings at great risk, simply due to the fact that they are being moved.  The amount of stress a painting can withstand is determined by a number of pre-existing factors, such as canvas and painting technique.  Prior to the loan, a paintings conservator will assess the structure of the work for weaknesses and potential areas at risk.  This helps determine if a piece is suitable for a loan and how it will be packed and transported.  Preparation for a loaned painting generally involves padding the work's frame and ensuring it is properly mounted, determination as to whether it will need a backing board, and what repairs the frame may need prior to transport. The paintings conservator may also be called upon to collaborate with other personnel from the loaning museum to assess the environment of the institution that is borrowing the work.  He or she may also take into consideration the travel route between the loaning and the borrowing institutions.  The transit planner must consider environmental conditions on the route, how often the work will need to be handled, and security.&lt;ref&gt;Richard, M., Mecklenburg, M. F., &amp; Merrill, R. M. (1991). Art in transit: Handbook for packing and transporting paintings. Washington: National Gallery of Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examination===
[[File:Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston.jpg|thumb|left|Art Restoration, Painting and Frame Restoration, before and after, Oliver Brothers Art Restoration, Boston]]
Examination is a series of scientific processes by which a paintings conservator collects information regarding the materials used, the technique of the painter, and what has contributed to the painting's current state.  Examination is a process that has evolved with the field of conservation.  Taking samples of materials in a painting has decreased in favor of less invasive techniques for analysis.  Examination has become a crucial part of the museum, conservation, and art historical worlds, helping to place paintings within a cultural and historical context.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences. (2005). Scientific examination of art: Modern techniques in conservation and analysis. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
{{Main|Art restoration}}

A painting's natural aging process, as well as environmental factors, can require intervention by a paintings conservator to restore the work.  Reasons for restoration may include water damage, tearing, flaking, and a weakened canvas.  The primary goal of a paintings conservator conducting a restoration is to ensure the work is stable.  From there, they may integrate repairs that preserve the artist's original intent.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.).

==Instrumentation and uses==

===Imaging methods===

'''Ultraviolet light'''

Ultraviolet light examinations are used to reveal varnishes and their ages, as well as previous treatments to a painting.  Varnishes fluoresce under UV light and dark spots reveal areas of retouching.  Brightness of the painting's glow also helps to reveal the type of varnish used.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. (2000, December). The use Of ultraviolet induced visible-fluorescence In the examination Of museum objects, Part II. Conserve O Gram, 1/10.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Lunder Conservation Center Laboratory.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The paintings conservation laboratory at the [[Lunder Conservation Center]]]]
'''Raking Light'''
{{Main|Raking light}}

Raking light is an oblique-angled light that can record condition problems of a painting, showing the extent of the damage to a particular work.  Raking light also aids in identifying the topography of brush strokes in paintings, sometimes revealing the underlying original intent of an artist.

'''Infrared light'''

The use of infrared lighting can reveal the working methods of an artist, such as initial sketches and perspective lines drawn on a canvas.  This method is effective on works that have a contrasting pale ground.&lt;ref&gt;Williamstown Art Conservation Center. (2008). Technical Imaging of Paintings [Brochure]. Author.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''X-radiography'''

X-radiographs of a painting allow conservators to see beneath the work's surface.  The use of this method also helps distinguish between materials that look similar under visible light, but have different x-ray absorption. For example, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] used x-radiography on a painting by [[Jean-Francois Millet]] entitled ''The Wood Sawyers.''  The image below showed a woman representing the French Republic, a submission to a competition that Millet would lose.  Without the means to pay for a new canvas, Millet painted over the existing image.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria and Albert Museum. (n.d.). X-radiography of paintings. Retrieved from http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/x/x-radiography-of-paintings/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lasers===
The use of lasers allows for control and accuracy in the removal of aged or deteriorated layers on painted works, as well as identifying materials and layers within a painting.  In 2012, Duke University scientists developed a laser for melanoma diagnoses.  Through work with the [[National Gallery]] and the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], the scientists have determined that this laser can also be used to identify the chemical signatures of pigments and three-dimensional structures in layers of artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Yeager, A. (2012, August 20). Duke Research - Lasers ID ancient artists' intent. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=https://research.duke.edu/stories/chemists-lasers-could-id-ancient-artists-intent |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821211051/http://research.duke.edu/stories/chemists-lasers-could-id-ancient-artists-intent |archivedate=2012-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Duke University chemist also invented a useful laser for painting conservators that removes layers of old varnish.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, R. (2013, August 9). Art Under the Laser – New "Noninvasive" Conservation and Analysis Treatments. Retrieved from http://artwatchinternational.org/articles/art_under_the_laser&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varnishes===
Varnishes are applied to paintings to enhance the appearance of the image, as well as to protect it over time.  When dry, varnishes are typically transparent and can vary in gloss and durability as its composition changes.  Varnishes may be organic or synthetic.  Since natural varnishes tend to darken or discolor over time, attention from a paintings conservator is often necessary to remove, replace, or restore it.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution. (n.d.). Painting varnishes. Retrieved from http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/painting_varnish.html.&lt;/ref&gt; It is again important to remember the artist's original intent when choosing a new varnish.  Varnishes often offer a desired effect, and a synthetic variety may not offer what an originally natural resin provided.

==Education and training==
[[File:Бобров Ф.Ю со студентами. 2010 г..jpg|thumb|Paintings conservators at work]]
A paintings conservator will likely have acquired a master's degree, or higher.  There are several graduate programs throughout the United States, and the world, for arts [[conservation and restoration training]].  The education and training of a conservator will vary depending on the institution he or she is employed by, but paintings conservators will have knowledge of chemistry and the physical sciences as related to the deterioration and protection of cultural heritage in painted works.  Practical application of training may be applied in the form of internships or fellowships, depending on the level of education an individual has received.

==Controversies==

Conservation and the practice of restoration are controversial themselves, as they involve permanent changes made to an artist's work.  This is why it is important for a paintings conservator to examine a work closely before making restorative changes.  In doing so, they can often identify original varnishes and layers that contributed to the artist's intent for the appearance of the work.  However, even close examination and careful restoration does not protect a paintings conservator or a work from being the center of controversy.

===Sistine Chapel restoration===
{{Main|Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes}}

Restoration of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has been ongoing during the latter part of the twentieth century.  Much of the criticism and controversy surrounding the restoration is that previous attempts to restore the frescoes have done more damage than good.  Critics of modern restoration have suggested a more conservative approach to prevent further deterioration, rather than contribute to its problems through restorative measures.

===''The Last Supper''===

Restoration on [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Last Supper (da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'' finished in 1999 after two decades of work.  Many believe the work done was clumsy, with some features being unrecognizably bright while others went missing altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Restored `Last Supper' Provokes Critics. (1999, May 28). Retrieved from http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-28/news/9905280144_1_restoration-masterpiece-grazie-church&lt;/ref&gt;

===Santuario de la Misericordia Fresco===
{{main|Ecce Homo (Martínez and Giménez, Borja)}}
In 2012, Cecilia Giménez, an elderly woman without conservation training, attempted to restore an ''Ecce Homo'' fresco in a Spanish church.  The fresco had been flaking due to moisture on the walls, and this reportedly upset the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Minder, R. (2012, August 23). Despite Good Intentions, a Fresco in Spain Is Ruined. Retrieved from https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/world/europe/botched-restoration-of-ecce-homo-fresco-shocks-spain.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her resulting restorative work left the portrait with what many have described as looking monkeyish, with cartoonish eyes and a smudged mouth.  The restoration attempt came to light after a family member of the original artist proposed a fund for conservation work.

'''Philosophy and literature''' involves the [[literature|literary]] treatment of [[philosopher]]s and [[philosophy|philosophical]] themes (the literature of philosophy), and the philosophical treatment of issues raised by literature (the philosophy of literature).

[[Image:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]] presented [[Socrates]] as a comic figure.]]

==The philosophy of literature==
Strictly speaking, the philosophy of literature is a branch of [[aesthetics]], the branch of philosophy that deals with the question, "what is [[art]]"?  Much of aesthetic philosophy has traditionally focused on the plastic arts or [[music]], however, at the expense of the verbal arts.  In fact, much traditional discussion of aesthetic philosophy seeks to establish criteria of artistic quality that are indifferent to the subject matter being depicted.  Since all literary works, almost by definition, contain notional content, aesthetic theories that rely on purely formal qualities tend to overlook literature.

The very existence of [[narrative]] raises philosophical issues.  In narrative, a creator can embody, and readers be led to imagine, [[fiction]]al characters, and even [[fantasy|fantastic]] creatures or technologies.  The ability of the human mind to imagine, and even to experience [[empathy]] with, these fictional characters is itself revealing about the nature of the human mind.  Some fiction can be thought of as a sort of a [[thought experiment]] in [[ethics]]: it describes fictional characters, their [[Motivation|motive]]s, their actions, and the consequences of their actions.  It is in this light that some philosophers have chosen various narrative forms to teach their philosophy (''see below'').

===Literature and language===
[[Plato]], for instance, believed that literary culture and even the [[lyrics]] of [[popular music]] had a strong impact on the ethical outlook of its consumers.  In ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]'', Plato displays a strong hostility to the contents of the literary culture of his period, and proposes a strong [[censorship]] of popular literature in his [[utopia]].

More recently, however, philosophers of various stripes have taken different and less hostile approaches to literature.  Since the work of the [[British Empiricists]] and [[Immanuel Kant]] in the late eighteenth century, Western philosophy has been preoccupied with a fundamental question of [[epistemology]]: the question of the relationship between [[idea]]s in the human mind and the world existing outside the mind, if in fact such a world exists.  In more recent years, these epistemological issues have turned instead to an extended discussion of [[word]]s and meaning: can [[language]] in fact bridge the barrier between minds?  This cluster of issues concerning the meaning of language and of "[[writing]]s" sometimes goes by the name of ''the [[linguistic turn]]''.

As such, techniques and tools developed for [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]] rose to greater prominence in Western philosophy of the late twentieth century.  Philosophers of various stripes paid more attention to literature than their predecessors did.  Some sought to examine the question of whether it was in fact truly possible to communicate using words, whether it was possible for an author's intended meaning to be communicated to a reader.  Others sought to use literary works as examples of contemporary [[culture]], and sought to reveal unconscious attitudes they felt present in these works for the purpose of social criticism.

===The truth of fiction===
Literary works also pose issues concerning [[truth]] and the [[philosophy of language]].  In educated opinion, at least, it is commonly reputed as true that ''[[Sherlock Holmes]] lived in London''. (see David Lewis 'Truth in Fiction', American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 15. No. 1, January 1978)  It is also considered true that ''[[Samuel Pepys]] lived in London''.  Yet Sherlock Holmes never lived anywhere at all; he is a fictional character.  Samuel Pepys, contrarily, is judged to have been a real person.  Contemporary interest in Holmes and in Pepys share strong similarities; the only reason why anyone knows either of their names is because of an abiding interest in reading about their alleged deeds and words.  These two statements would appear to belong to two different orders of truth.  Further problems arise concerning the [[truth value]] of statements about fictional worlds and characters that can be implied but are nowhere explicitly stated by the sources for our knowledge about them, such as ''Sherlock Holmes had only one head'' or ''Sherlock Holmes never travelled to the moon''.

==The literature of philosophy==

===Philosophical poems===
{{Literature}}
A number of [[poetry|poets]] have written poems on philosophical themes, and some important philosophers have expressed their philosophy in verse.  The [[cosmogony]] of [[Hesiod]] and the ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' of [[Lucretius]] are important philosophical poems. The genre of [[epic poetry]] was also used to teach philosophy. [[Vyasa]] narrated the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' in order to teach [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Hindu philosophy]]. [[Homer]] also presented some philosophical teachings in his ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Many of the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophers]] worked out their thought in poetical fashion. Some of the important names include:

* [[Vyasa]]
* [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi]]
* [[Omar Khayyám]]
* [[Nizami Ganjavi]]
* [[Saadi (poet)|Sheikh Saadi]]
* [[Hafez|Hafiz Shirazi]]
* [[Muhammad Iqbal]]
* [[Matsuo Bashō]]
* [[Farid ud-Din Attar]]
* [[Salah Abd El-sabur]]
* [[Mahmoud Darwish]]
* [[Karim Elsaiad]]

Notable Western [[philosophical poets]] include:

* [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]
* [[St. John of the Cross]]
* [[T. S. Eliot]]
* [[Hildegard von Bingen]]
* [[Homer]]
* [[John Milton]]
* [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]
* [[James Wright (poet)|James Wright]]
* [[Marianne Moore]]
* [[Pablo Neruda]]
* [[William Carlos Williams]]
* [[Mary Oliver]]
* [[ Rainer Maria Rilke]]
* [[Leslie Marmon Silko]]
* [[Robert Creeley]]
* [[Fernando Pessoa]]
* [[Søren Kierkegaard]]
* [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
* [[Georges Bataille]]
* [[Lucretius]]

===Philosophical fiction===
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Borges.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Jorge Luis Borges]] wrote philosophical fiction.]] --&gt;
Some philosophers have undertaken to write philosophy in the form of [[fiction]], including novels and short stories (see separate article on [[philosophical fiction]]).  This is apparent early on in the literature of philosophy, where philosophers such as [[Plato]] wrote [[dialogue]]s in which fictional or fictionalized characters discuss philosophical subjects; [[Socrates]] frequently appears as a protagonist in Plato's dialogues, and the dialogues are one of the prime sources of knowledge about Socrates' teaching, though at this remove it is sometimes hard to distinguish Socrates' actual positions from Plato's own. Numerous early Christian writers, including [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Boethius]], and [[Peter Abelard]] produced dialogues; several early modern philosophers, such as [[George Berkeley]] and [[David Hume]], wrote occasionally in this genre.

Other philosophers have resorted to [[narrative]] to get their teachings across. The classical 12th century [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]], [[Ibn Tufail|Abubacer]] (Ibn Tufail), wrote a fictional [[Arabic literature|Arabic narrative]] ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]'' as a response to [[al-Ghazali]]'s ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'', and then the 13th century [[Kalam|Islamic theologian]]-philosopher [[Ibn al-Nafis]] also wrote a fictional narrative ''Theologus Autodidactus'' as a response to Abubacer's ''Philosophus Autodidactus''. The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often articulated his ideas in literary modes, most notably in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', a re-imagined account of the teachings of [[Zoroaster]]. [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Ayn Rand]] wrote novels in which characters served as mouthpieces for philosophical positions, and act in accordance with them in the plot. [[George Santayana]] was also a philosopher who wrote novels and poetry; the relationship between Santayana's characters and his beliefs is more complex.  The [[existentialism|existentialists]] include among their numbers important [[French language|French]] authors who used fiction to convey their philosophical views; these include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s novel ''[[Nausea (Book)|Nausea]]'' and play ''[[No Exit]]'', and [[Albert Camus]]'s  ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]''. [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s entire fictional production, whose titles include ''[[The Step Not Beyond]]'', ''[[The madness of the Day]]'', and ''[[The Writing of Disaster]]'', among others, constitutes an indispensable corpus for the treatment of the relationship between philosophy and literature. So does [[Jacques Derrida]]'s ''[[The Post Card: From Socrates to Freud and Beyond]]''.

A number of philosophers have had important influence on literature.  [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], largely as a result of his [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics|system of aesthetics]], is perhaps the most influential recent philosopher in the history of literature; [[Thomas Hardy]]'s later novels frequently allude to Schopenhauerian themes, particularly in ''[[Jude the Obscure]]''.  Schopenhauer also had an important influence on [[Joseph Conrad]].  Schopenhauer also had a less specific but more  widely diffused influence on the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] in European literature.  [[Lionel Johnson]] also refers to Schopenhauer's aesthetics in his essay ''The Cultured Faun''. [[Jacques Derrida]]'s entire oeuvre has been hugely influential for so-called continental philosophy and the understanding of the role of literature in modernity.

Other works of fiction considered to have philosophical content include:

*Abubacer, ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Philosophus Autodidactus]]''
*Albert Camus, ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Outsider]]''
*Joseph Conrad, ''[[Heart of Darkness]]''
*Fyodor Dostoevsky, ''[[Crime and Punishment]]
*Jostein Gaarder, ''[[Sophie's World]]
* Hermann Hesse, ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]
*James Joyce, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''
*Franz Kafka, ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''
*Milan Kundera, ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''
*Ibn al-Nafis, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]''
*Thomas Mann, ''[[The Magic Mountain]]''
*Iris Murdoch, ''[[The Sea, the Sea]]''
*Robert M. Pirsig, ''[[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]]''
*Marcel Proust, ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]
*William Shakespeare, ''[[Hamlet]]''
*Leo Tolstoy, ''[[The Death of Ivan Ilyich]]''
*Sergio Troncoso, ''[[The Nature of Truth]]''
*Marguerite Yourcenar, ''[[Memoirs of Hadrian]]''

===Philosophical writing as literature===
A number of philosophers are still read for the literary merits of their works apart from their philosophical content.  The philosophy in the ''[[Meditations]]'' of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] is unoriginal [[Stoicism]], but the ''Meditations'' are still read for their literary merit and for the insight they give into the workings of the emperor's mind.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s philosophy is noted for the quality and readability of its prose, as are some of the works of the [[British Empiricism|British Empiricists]], such as [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]].  [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s style is frequently regarded as poetic artistry as well as philosophical, especially in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' and ''[[Either/Or]]''.  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s works such as ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' frequently resemble [[prose poetry]] and contain imagery and allusion instead of argument.

==Philosophy in literature==

===Philosophers in literature===
Socrates appears in a highly fictionalized guise, as a comic figure and the object of mockery, in ''[[The Clouds]]'' by [[Aristophanes]].  In the play, Socrates appears hanging from a basket, where he delivers oracles such as:

:I'd never come up with a single thing&lt;br&gt; about celestial phenomena,&lt;br&gt;if I did not suspend my mind up high,&lt;br&gt;to mix my subtle thoughts with what's like them—&lt;br&gt;the air. If I turned my mind to lofty things,&lt;br&gt;but stayed there on the ground, I'd never make&lt;br&gt;the least discovery. For the earth, you see,&lt;br&gt;draws moist thoughts down by force into itself—&lt;br&gt;the same process takes place with water cress.

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] is perhaps the twentieth century's preeminent author of philosophical fiction.  He wrote a short story in which the philosopher [[Averroes]] is the chief protagonist, ''[[Averroes's Search]]''.  Many plot points in his stories accurately paraphrase and epitomize the thought of major philosophers, including [[George Berkeley]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]; he also attributes various opinions to figures including [[George Dalgarno]].

A key plot point in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' turns on the discovery of a mysterious book that turns out to contain a lost manuscript by [[Aristotle]].  Eco's later novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum (book)|Foucault's Pendulum]]'' became the forerunner of a run of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]]s or [[detective fiction]] that toss around learned allusions and the names of historical thinkers; more recent examples include [[Dan Brown]]'s ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' and ''[[The Rule of Four (book)|The Rule of Four]]'' by [[Ian Caldwell]] and [[Dustin Thomason]].

Also, [[Philip K. Dick]], who has often been compared to Borges, raises a significant number of philosophical issues in his novels, everything from the problem of [[solipsism]] to many questions of [[perception]] and [[reality]].

===Fictional philosophers===
Jorge Luis Borges introduces many philosophical themes, and a number of fictional philosophers, in his [[short story|short stories]].  A fictional philosophical movement is a part of the premise of his story ''[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]'', and the unnamed narrator of his story ''[[The Library of Babel]]'' could also be called a fictional philosopher.  A fictional [[theology|theologian]] is the subject of his story ''[[Three Versions of Judas]]''.

Fictional philosophers occasionally occur throughout the works of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].  Heinlein's ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' contains long passages that could be considered as successors to the fictionalized philosophical dialogues of the ancient world, set within the plot.

==History==
The Prešeren Award was for the first time bestowed in 1947, on the basis of a decree from 1946. It was originally given on 8 February, [[Prešeren Day]], the holiday commemorating the anniversary of the death of the Slovene [[national poet]] [[France Prešeren]].&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; In 1955, the first act on the Prešeren awards was passed. By it, the award gained its current name and the Prešeren Fund was established, which by the amendments of the act in 1956 became a legal personality.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1961, the awards were conferred also for the lifetime work. In addition, the Prešeren Fund Award was introduced.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since that year, these awards have been conferred only for exceptional achievements in the field of arts. In 1982, the Prešeren Fund came under the auspice of the [[Cultural Community of Slovenia]]. At most three Prešeren Awards and ten Prešeren Fund Awards were given.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; Since 1991, when the ''Prešeren Award Act'' ({{lang|sl|Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi}}) was passed,&lt;ref name="ZUODNO-G"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pisrs.si/Predpis.aspx?id=ZAKO866&amp;pogled=osnovni |title=Zakon o Prešernovi nagradi (ZPreN) Ur.l. RS, št. 29I/1991) |accessdate=19 April 2011 |work=PisRS |publisher=Office of Legislation, Slovenia}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fund works under the auspice of the Slovenian administrative body in charge of culture.&lt;ref name="Kološa1999" /&gt; According to the act, at most two awards may be given.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Prešeren Fund==
The Prešeren Award and the Prešeren Fund Award are bestowed by the Prešeren Fund Management Board ({{lang|sl|Upravni odbor Prešernovega sklada}}). Its 15 members are artists or other cultural workers, like critics, historians, and theoreticians. They are nominated by the [[Slovenian Government]] and elected for a four-year term by the [[National Assembly (Slovenia)|National Assembly of Slovenia]]. The board, which was last elected in May 2008, elected [[Jaroslav Skrušny]] as its chair in July 2008.&lt;ref name="STA2011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |title=Prva seja upravnega odbora Prešernovega sklada v Kranju |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The First Session of the Prešeren Fund Management Board in Kranj |date=22 September 2011 |newspaper=Misli slovensko [Think Slovene] |publisher=Slovenian Press Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418153027/http://ms.sta.si/2011/09/prva-seja-upravnega-odbora-presernovega-sklada-v-kranju/ |archivedate=18 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prešeren Fund now operates under the auspice of the [[Ministry of Culture (Slovenia)|Slovenian Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref name="Fund2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |title=Prešeren Fund |publisher=Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417131925/http://www.mk.gov.si/en/about_the_ministry/expert_committees_counsels_and_funds/preseren_fund/ |archivedate=17 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in February 2012, Skrušny described the work by the Board as independent and denied any political pressure in the past few years.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Selection and proclamation of the winners==
On 10 February, the Prešeren Fund announces a public tender, which lasts until 15 September. Any physical or legal person may nominate authors for the award, but have to provide appropriate rationale and references.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; About 100 proposals are put forward each year,&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt; the majority of proposals from the [[performing arts]].&lt;ref name="STA2011" /&gt;  The selection is based on artistic value of the works by the proposed artists as well as other criteria, such as the equal representation of gender, regions, generations, and world views, trying to achieve a balanced and plural choice. Both the established artists and debitants have won the award. The nominees are then selected by the four field committees of the Prešeren Fund, each comprising seven members named by the Prešeren Fund Management Board. Each committee proposes two names for the Prešeren Award and six names for the Prešeren Fund Award, altogether eight for the great award and 24 for the little award. The board then makes the final selection with a secret vote in November after a long discussion and proclaims the awardees after they are elected by two thirds of members. If necessary, more voting rounds may take place. Although in the past, the names of the awardees were announced already on 3 December, the date of the anniversary of Prešeren's births, in the last years they have remained secret until the award ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kavčič2012" /&gt;

==Review of the awardees==
Since Slovenian declaration of independence in 1991, the majority of the Prešeren Award winners have been literary artists, among them the only woman being Makarovič, who declined the award in 2000 but accepted the money.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siol.net/novice/poglobljeno/2011/06/dvajset_let_umetnosti_v_sloveniji.aspx |title=Dvajset let umetnosti v Sloveniji |language=Slovenian |trans-title=Twenty Years of Art in Slovenia |newspaper=Planet Siol.net |publisher=TSMedia d. o. o. |date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the field of performing arts, only two artists won the award. From the field of music, the awardees have been mainly composers and conductors, with the only instrumentalist being the flautist [[Irena Grafenauer]]. A general trend of older men active in [[institution]]alised arts is recognisable among the awardees. The group of the Prešeren Fund Award winners is more diverse.&lt;ref name="Planet2011-06" /&gt;

The '''Prince's Theatre''' in Oxford Street, [[Manchester]], England, was built at a cost of £20,000 in 1864. Under the artistic and managerial leadership of [[Charles Alexander Calvert|Charles Calvert]], "Manchester's most celebrated actor-manager", it soon became a great popular success. The theatre's first production, Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', took place on 15&amp;nbsp;October 1864;&lt;ref name=RudyardWykePP47-48&gt;{{Harvnb|Rudyard|Wyke|1994|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvert himself played [[Prospero]] and his wife took the role of [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]]. ''The Times'' newspaper of 18&amp;nbsp;October reported that the 1,590-seat theatre "was exceedingly well filled", and declared the evening "a brilliant success".&lt;ref name=Times1864&gt;{{citation |title=The Drama in Manchester |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/346/292/133531392w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS202547026&amp;dyn=8!xrn_3_0_CS202547026&amp;hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |newspaper=The Times |date=18 October 1864 |accessdate=29 December 2010}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre subsequently became synonymous with Calvert's elaborate and historically accurate Shakespearian productions.&lt;ref name=RudyardWykePP47-48/&gt;

The theatre's interior was extensively rebuilt by [[Alfred Darbyshire]] in 1869. The work included the addition of 300&amp;nbsp;seats,&lt;ref name=RudyardWykePP47-48/&gt; and featured a frieze over the [[proscenium]] painted by [[Henry Stacy Marks]] showing Shakespeare flanked by muses and his principal characters. The Prince's was the first theatre to introduce [[tip-up seat]]s and "early doors" tickets, which for a premium allowed patrons to enter the theatre early, to avoid the usual opening-time crush.&lt;ref name=RudyardWykePP47-48/&gt;

The years after the First World War saw a decline in the theatre's fortunes, and by the 1930s the increasing competition from cinema was threatening its viability. The final performance took place in April 1940, after which the building was sold to the [[ABC Cinemas|ABC]] cinema company, who intended to replace it with a large cinema complex. Although the theatre was demolished shortly afterwards, the intervention of the Second World War meant that the cinema was never built; the site is now occupied by Peter House, a large office complex completed in 1958.&lt;ref name=RudyardWykePP47-48/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manchesterconfidential.co.uk/Culture/Architecture/The-Good-the-Standard-and-the-Ugly-Peter-House |title=The Good, the Standard and the Ugly: Peter House &amp;#124; Architecture |publisher=Manchester Confidential |date=23 November 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2012 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The River's Edge Arts Alliance''', also known as the Hudson Area Arts Alliance, was organized in 1990 and incorporated on March 7, 1991.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance is a local, non-profit 501(c)(3) charitable organization which has been dedicated to promoting community arts, arts education and cultural enrichment for the past two decades.  The organization provides arts activities that appeal to a broad range of interests, age groups and backgrounds, the River's Edge Arts Alliance has positively impacted the region's cultural development by offering a wide spectrum of visual and performing art, while bringing people together to enjoy a variety of dynamic arts activities.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance presents musical performances, theater performances, art exhibits as well as offering education classes for children and adults in art, music and theater.  It promotes the growth of the arts in cities and towns in MetroWest Boston as well as Central Massachusetts.

== Location ==
The River's Edge Arts Alliance Office is located in the Hudson Public Schools Administration Building at 155 Apsley Street in [[Hudson, Massachusetts]].

== History ==
The concept of the River's Arts Alliance was developed in 1988 when local parents and teachers created an informal organization to increase cultural activities for school children and their families.  The Community Arts Series was created in 1988, followed by the Drama Workshop summer program in 1989. The River's Edge Arts Alliance was formed the following year to manage the Arts Series and Drama Workshop.  Visual art exhibits as well as a newsletter and arts calendar were developed.

Jan Patterson, a founding member of the River's Edge Arts Alliance, was hired as full-time executive director in 1993 through a grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.  After school classes, area arts meetings and other programs were added, and the River's Edge Arts Alliance became increasingly known at the regional level.   A program director was hired in 1998 with additional staff added in subsequent years.  The After School Band Lesson Program was developed in 1997 and the Focus on Kids! Series in Marlborough in 1999.  The following year the agency took over management of the Pro Musica Youth Chorus, now called the River's Edge Youth Chorus, and in 2002 the River's Edge Community Band was formed.  Art in the Hall, a series of individual artist exhibits at Hudson Town Hall, was developed in December 2003. The River's Edge Chorale was formed in 2005, followed by the River's Edge Players in 2006.

The River's Edge Arts Alliance fosters appreciation of the arts through education, performance, exhibition, promotion, and by serving as a resource for arts education, cultural groups, and artists in the area.  It serves children, parents, elders, artists, arts organizations, schools, and the population at large as it seeks to inspire deeper interest in all aspects of the arts, foster understanding and appreciation of cultural diversity, and integrate the arts more fully into individual and community life.
	
The organization effectively brings artists into the community while developing the artistic potential of those who live here.  Managed by a small staff, an active board of directors and many other enthusiastic volunteers, the Arts Alliance currently has 150 donors/sponsors and about 350 members from 35 area communities who are individuals, families, artists, organizations and businesses.  There are many other ways that individuals, businesses, organizations, municipalities and foundations support the River's Edge Arts Alliance. Making the arts flourish locally, this support demonstrates the value placed on the creative arts for the many ways they inspire and enrich our communities.
  
The River's Edge Arts Alliance offers a broad array of arts activities in which thousands of adults and children participate, often as families.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance is responsible for creating and sustaining many cultural activities and organizations including: Art in the Hall, Arts After School, Arts in the Park, Community Arts Series, Focus on the Arts, Hudson Band Lesson Program, Hudson Pathways, River's Edge Youth Chorus, River's Edge Chorale, River's Edge Community Band, River's Edge Players, Saturday Morning Discovery Series, Summer Arts, Summer Drama Workshop (now in its 25th year) and many visual arts exhibits.  These quality, yet affordable, events, exhibits and classes are held in Hudson and surrounding towns. In addition to its regular programming in performing arts, visual arts and arts education, the agency has participated in many collaborative and partnership initiatives.  Marlborough residents have participated in Arts Alliance programs since the beginning, and during the past thirteen years, the Arts Alliance has offered an increasing number of programs in the City.

Many community-minded people value creativity and the way it inspires our lives and improves the area's quality of life.  Thanks to the support of area individuals, organizations, businesses, municipalities and foundations that value the arts which so enrich our lives, many community members participate in these free or moderately-priced programs.  The organization believes in integrating the arts into everyday community life, as well as helping arts education thrive. It creates and sustains participant and performance opportunities.  The Arts Alliance collaborates with schools, arts organizations, businesses and artists, all the while bringing diverse people together.  The most critical factor in sustaining area arts programming is the active involvement of the community, people interested in making a difference in their community through the arts.

The Commonwealth Award is the state's highest honor in the arts, humanities and interpretive sciences.  These awards are presented every two years by the Massachusetts Cultural Council to honor individuals and organizations that have made extraordinary contributions to the quality of life, education, and economy in Massachusetts through arts and culture.  This prestigious honor was awarded to the River's Edge Arts Alliance at the State House in 1997.  In 1995 Aerosmith received the Catalyst award, an earlier version of the MCC's Creative Economy Award.  Other winners have included Doris Kearns Goodwin, David McCullough, Henry Hampton, Bradford Washburn, Dr. Stephen Jay Gould, DeCordova Museum &amp; Sculpture Park, Wheelock Family Theater, Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras, North Bennet Street School, Massachusetts College of Art, Stanley Kunitz (10th US Poet Laureate,) Richard Yarde, Yo Yo Ma, Robert Brustein (American Repertory Theatre), Edmund Barry Gaither, Gunther Schuller, City of Pittsfield, Worcester Cultural Coalition and Peabody Essex Museum.

Each year the River's Edge Arts Alliance sponsors dozens of exciting, enriching and entertaining events, exhibits and educational workshops in Marlborough and Hudson, providing the public with numerous opportunities to experience quality arts programs that boost the cultural ambiance of the area.  It brough over thirteen years of bringing to Marlborough the quality cultural programming the Focus on the Arts Series (formerly named Focus on Kids) and Children's Theater Workshop performances.  For ten years, the popular Family Fun Festivals (formerly called The Saturday Morning Discovery Series), a program managed by the River's Edge Arts Alliance for the City of Marlborough, has offered some of the region's top performers presenting free performances on Union Common in the summer and at the Walker Building or Marlborough Senior Center in the winter.

The River's Arts Alliance's 20th anniversary was celebrated on January 16, 2010 with the "Taste of the Arts" Gala at the Hudson Public Library.  The Hudson Selectmen's proclamation was read by Sonny Parente, and [[Jamie Eldridge|Senator Jamie Eldridge]] and [[Kate Hogan|Representative Kate Hogan]] offered recognition from the State House.  Also on hand were a variety of musicians and visual artists who shared their work with the attendees as well as board members, staff and many community leaders and arts supporters.

The River's edge Arts Alliance continues to publish a quarterly newsletter and arts calendar and formerly provided the Guide to Culture and Community, its annual program book.  It was estimated in 2010 that more than 23,000 people benefited from the many performances, workshops, concerts, exhibits and other arts events the River's Edge Arts Alliance helped produce.  The River's Edge Arts Alliance offers sponsorship opportunities for organizations and businesses to promote their groups while showing support for the community and the arts.  Memberships, sponsorships and volunteer support enable the River's Edge Arts Alliance to sustain its mission to "enrich lives and create community through the arts.  They also offer advertising in their event programs.

'''Samuel Palmer''' (27 January 1805 – 24 May 1881) was a British [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter, [[etcher]] and [[printmaker]]. He was also a prolific writer. Palmer was a key figure in [[Romanticism]] in Britain and produced visionary pastoral paintings.

==Early life==
Palmer, who was born in Surrey Square off the [[Old Kent Road]] in [[Newington, London]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/samuel_palmer/palmer_and_primitivism.aspx Samuel Palmer on the British Museum Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051208/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/britain/samuel_palmer/palmer_and_primitivism.aspx |date=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the son of a bookseller and sometime [[Baptist]] minister, and was raised by a pious nurse. Palmer painted churches from around age twelve, and first exhibited [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|Turner]]-inspired works at the [[Royal Academy]] at the age of fourteen. He had little formal training, and little formal schooling, although he was educated briefly at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]].&lt;ref&gt;Minchin, J. G. C., ''Our public schools, their influence on English history; Charter house, Eton, Harrow, Merchant Taylors', Rugby, St. Paul's Westminster, Winchester'' (London, 1901), p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shoreham==
[[File:Samuel Palmer 002.jpg|left|thumbnail|234px|''In a Shoreham Garden''. 1820s or early 1830s]]
Through [[John Linnell (1792)|John Linnell]], he met [[William Blake]] in 1824.  Blake's influence can be seen in work he produced over the next ten years and generally reckoned to be his greatest. The works were landscapes around [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]], near Sevenoaks in the west of [[Kent]]. He purchased a run-down cottage, nicknamed "Rat Abbey", and lived there from 1826 to 1835, depicting the area as a demi-paradise, mysterious and visionary, often shown in sepia shades under moon and star light. There Palmer associated with a group of Blake-influenced artists known as [[Ancients (art group)|the Ancients]] (including [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] and [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]]).  They were among the few who saw the Shoreham paintings as, resulting from attacks by critics in 1825, he opened his early portfolios only to selected friends.

Palmer's somewhat disreputable father &amp;ndash; Samuel Palmer senior &amp;ndash; moved to the area, his brother Nathaniel having offered him an allowance that would "make him a gentleman" and restore the good name of the family.  Samuel Palmer senior rented half of the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]]-era 'Waterhouse' which still stands by the [[River Darent]] at Shoreham and is now known as the 'Water House'. Palmer's nurse, Mary Ward, and his other son William joined him there. The Waterhouse was used to accommodate overflow guests from "Rat Abbey". In 1828 Samuel Palmer left "Rat Abbey" to join his father at Water House and lived there for the rest of his time in Shoreham. While at Shoreham he fell in love with the fourteen-year-old Hannah Linnell, whom he later married.

==Maturity==
[[File:Palmer. A Cornfield by Moonlight with the Evening Star. Watercolour with bodycolour and pen and ink c.1830..jpg|right|thumbnail|234px|''A Cornfield by Moonlight with the Evening Star'' c. 1830]]
After returning to London in 1835, and using a small legacy to purchase a house in [[Marylebone]], Palmer produced less mystical and more conventional work. Part of his reason in returning to London was to sell his work and earn money from private teaching. He had better health on his return to London, and was by then married to Hannah, daughter of the painter [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] who he had known since she was a child, and married when she was nineteen and he was thirty-two. He sketched in [[Devon]]shire and Wales around this time. His peaceful vision of rural England had been disrupted by the [[Swing Riots|violent rural discontent]] of the early 1830s. His small financial legacy was running out and he decided to produce work more in line with public taste if he was to earn an income for himself and his wife. He was following the advice of his father-in-law. Linnell, who had earlier shown remarkable understanding of the uniqueness of [[William Blake]]'s genius, was not as generous with his son-in-law, towards whom his attitude was authoritarian and often harsh.

Palmer turned more to watercolour which was gaining popularity in England. To further a commercial career, the couple embarked on a two-year [[honeymoon]] to Italy, made possible by money from Hannah's parents in 1837. In Italy Palmer's palette became brighter, sometimes to the point of garishness, but he made many fine sketches and studies that would later be useful in producing new paintings. On his return to London, Palmer sought patrons with limited success. For more than two decades he was obliged to work as a private drawing master, until he moved from London in 1862. To add to his financial worries, he returned to London to find his dissolute brother William had pawned all his early paintings, and Palmer was obliged to pay a large sum to redeem them. By all accounts Palmer was an excellent teacher, but the work with uninspired students reduced the time he could devote to his own art.

==Later years==
From the early 1860s he gained some measure of critical success for his later landscapes, which had a touch of the early Shoreham work about them – most notable is the etching of ''The Lonely Tower'' (1879).  He became a full member of the [[Water Colour Society]] in 1854, and its annual show gave him a yearly goal to work towards.

[[File:Palmer. A Dream in the Appenine c.1864 (watercolor and gouache on paper laid on wood) Tate Britain.jpg|right|thumbnail|234px|''A Dream in the Apennine'' (c. 1864)]]

His best late works include a series of large watercolours illustrating [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poems ''[[L'Allegro]]'' and ''[[Il Penseroso]]'' and his etchings, a medium in which he worked from 1850 onwards, including a set illustrating [[Virgil]].

Palmer's later years were darkened by the death in 1861, at the age of 19, of his elder son Thomas More Palmer &amp;ndash; a devastating blow from which he never fully recovered. He lived in various places later in his life, including a small cottage and an unaffordable villa both in [[Kensington]], where he lived at 6 [[Drouro Place]],&lt;ref name="kensingtonpast114"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denny|first1=Barbara|last2=Starren|first2=Carolyn|title=Kensington Past|date=1998|publisher=Historical Publications|location=London, U.K.|isbn=9780948667503|oclc=42308455|page=114|quote=The residents were somewhat lower perhaps on the social scale, but many had distinguished artistic reputations such as the sculptor Alfred Stevens, at 7 Canning Place, and the painter, Samuel Palmer, at 6 Drouro Place, 1851–61.}}&lt;/ref&gt; then a cottage at [[Reigate]]. But it was only when a small measure of financial security came his way, that was he able to move to Furze Hill House in Redhill, Surrey, from 1862.  He could not afford to have a daily newspaper delivered to Redhill, suggesting that his financial circumstances there were still tight.

Samuel Palmer died in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], Surrey, and is buried with his wife in Reigate churchyard.

==Legacy==

Palmer was largely forgotten after his death. In 1909, many of his Shoreham works were destroyed by his surviving son Alfred Herbert Palmer, who burnt "a great quantity of father's handiwork ... Knowing that no one would be able to make head or tail of what I burnt; I wished to save it from a more humiliating fate".  The destruction included "sketchbooks, notebooks, and original works, and lasted for days". It wasn't until 1926 that Palmer's rediscovery began through a show curated by Martin Hardie at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], ''Drawings, Etchings and Woodcuts made by Samuel Palmer and other Disciples of William Blake''. But it took until the early 1950s for his reputation to recover, stimulated by [[Geoffrey Grigson]]'s 280-page book ''Samuel Palmer'' (1947) and later by an exhibition of the Shoreham work in 1957 and by Grigson's 1960 selection of Palmer's writing.  His reputation rests mainly on his Shoreham work, but some of his later work has recently received more appreciation.

The Shoreham work has had a powerful influence on many English artists after being rediscovered. Palmer was a notable influence on [[F. L. Griggs]], [[Robin Tanner]], [[Graham Sutherland]], [[Paul Drury]], [[Joseph Webb]], [[Eric Ravilious]], [[John Minton (artist)|John Minton]], the glass engraving of [[Laurence Whistler]], and [[Clifford Harper]]. He also inspired a resurgence in twentieth-century landscape printmaking, which began amongst students at Goldsmiths' College in the 1920s. (See: Jolyon Drury, 2006)

In 2005 the [[British Museum]] collaborated with the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] to stage the first major retrospective of his work, timed to coincide with the bicentenary of Palmer's birth. The show ran from October 2005 to January 2006, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, March &amp;ndash; May 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3966">[[File:Woody Guthrie 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Woody Guthrie in 1943 with his [[guitar]] labeled "This machine kills fascists"]]
"'''This Machine Kills Fascists'''" is a message that [[Woody Guthrie]] placed on his guitar in 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Class in America [Three Volumes]: An Encyclopedia|editor=Robert Weir|page=337|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; which inspired many subsequent artists.

==Conception==
Soon after moving into a small fourth-floor walk-up apartment in Manhattan, Guthrie wrote the war song "Talking [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s Head Off Blues".  This was printed in the ''[[Daily Worker]]'' newspaper: then "In a fit of patriotism and faith in the impact of the song, he painted on his guitar THIS MACHINE KILLS FASCISTS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=There Ain't Nobody That Can Sing Like Me: The Life of Woody Guthrie|author=Anne E. Neimark|publisher=Atheneurn Books|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guthrie's stance against fascism==
In Guthrie's opposition to [[fascism]], he conceptualized the ideology "as a form of economic exploitation similar to slavery," straightforwardly denouncing the fascists - particularly their leaders - as a group of gangsters who set out to 'rob the world'."&lt;ref name="The Life"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Life, Music and Thought of Woody Guthrie: A Critical Appraisal|author=John S. Partington|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recalled a protest strategy he had used "during the [[Great Depression]], when social, political and economic inequality had been engendered by a small rich elite."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; During that era, Guthrie had "romanticized the deeds of outlaws such as [[Jesse James]], [[Pretty Boy Floyd]], [[Calamity Jane]] or the [[Dalton Gang]] both as legitimate acts of social responsibility and as 'the ultimate expression of protest', thus transforming the outlaw into an archetypal partisan in a fight against those who were held responsible for the worsening social and economic conditions".&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt;

In this, Guthrie cast those opposing fascism not as mere outlaws in a fascist state, but as heroes rising "in times of economic turmoil and social disintegration" to fight "a highly illegitimate criminal endeavor intended to exploit the common people."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; Guthrie portrayed these characters as something larger than merely "dumb gangsters," while his lyricism also "externalized the inhuman element of fascism by describing its representatives as animals that were usually held in very low esteem and were associated with a range of bad character traits."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; For example, he talked about the "Nazi Snake" that has to be countered in his song, "Talking Hitler's Head Off Blues."&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; Guthrie would declare "[a]nything human is anti Hitler" and in his song "You Better Get Ready" he has the figure of [[Satan]] declare that "Old [[Hell]] just ain't the same/Compared to Hitler, hell, I'm tame!"&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt; Guthrie saw the battle against fascism as the ultimate battle of good versus evil. In a letter to "Railroad Pete" he stated "fascism and freedom are the only two sides battling...[this was the war] the world has been waiting on for twenty five million years...[which would] settle the score once and for all".&lt;ref name="The Life"/&gt;

Guthrie did celebrate the killing of fascists by Soviet sniper [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] in his song "Miss Pavlichenko" which includes the lines, "You lift up your sight and down comes a hun, 
and more than three hundred nazidogs fell by your gun."&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie, Woody, Guthrie, Hardtravelin’ The Asch Recirdings Vol 1, Smithsonian Folkways, Washington D.C.  1998, track 8&lt;/ref&gt;
