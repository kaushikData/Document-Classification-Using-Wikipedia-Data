      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4667">The '''21 demands of MKS''' ({{lang-pl|21 postulatów MKS}}) was  a list of demands issued on 17 August 1980 by the [[Interfactory Strike Committee]] (''Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, MKS'') in [[Poland]]. 

[[File:Strajk sierpniowy w Stoczni Gdańskiej im. Lenina 11.jpg|thumb|Boards with the 21 demands displayed by the entrance gate to the Lenin Shipyard in August 1980]]The first demand was the right to create independent [[trade union]]s. Other demands called the government to respect the constitutional rights and freedoms, dismantling the privileges for [[Polish United Workers' Party]] members, and taking actions to improve the economic conditions of Polish citizens. The demands eventually led to the [[Gdańsk Agreement]] and creation of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]].

The charter was written up on two wooden boards and hung on the gates of the shipyard on 18 August 1980. To mark the first anniversary of the August unrest, the demands were put on display in Gdańsk’s Maritime Museum. The day after Martial Law was declared one museum worker hid them in his loft, where they remained forgotten until 1996. Now added to the [[UNESCO]] [[Memory of the World Register]], they can be found housed in Gdańsk’s Roads to Freedom exhibition.

[[File:Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale (book spines).jpg|thumb|right|The eleven volumes of the ADSS]]
'''''Actes et Documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale''''' ([[French language|French]] for '''Acts and Documents of the Holy See related to the Second World War'''), often abbreviated '''''Actes''''' or '''ADSS''', is an eleven-volume collection of documents from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] historical archives, related to the papacy of [[Pope Pius XII]] during [[World War II]].

The collection was compiled by four [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest-historians&amp;mdash;[[Pierre Blet]] (France), [[Angelo Martini]] (Italy), [[Burkhart Schneider]] (Germany), and [[Robert A. Graham]] (United States)&amp;mdash;authorized by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1964, and published between 1965 and 1981.

The remainder of the documents from Pius XII's papacy may not be released for years; Bishop [[Sergio Pagano]], the prefect of the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] announced in June 2009 that five or six years additional of preparation would be necessary to organize the papers, after which the decision to make further documents available to researchers will be the pope's.&lt;ref&gt;AFP. 2009, July 7. "[http://www.canada.com/Life/Secret+archives+Pius+remain+closed+years/1752643/story.html Secret Archives of Pius XII to remain closed for years]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704152250/http://www.canada.com/Life/Secret%2Barchives%2BPius%2Bremain%2Bclosed%2Byears/1752643/story.html |date=July 4, 2009 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; The completed catalog would include approximately 16 million documents from Pius XII's papacy (1939-1958), divided into approximately 700 boxes related to the [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] and the various [[nunciature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zenit. 2009, July 2. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110608001459/http://www.zenit.org/article-26350?l=english Five year timeline proposed for Pius XII archives]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The collection is a rare exception to the Vatican's ''de facto'' seventy-five year rule for opening its archives, published in the aftermath of the controversial play, ''[[The Deputy]]'', by [[Rolf Hochhuth]].&lt;ref name="s29"&gt;Sánchez, 2002, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was intended to answer critics of [[Pius XII]], such as Hochhuth, who alleged that the Pope had turned a blind eye to Nazi atrocities against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, Margherita. ''Pope Pius XII: Architect for Peace''. 2000, page 201&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the editors presented a variety of documents which they claim demonstrate how Pope Pius XII protested the persecution of and various deportations of Jews. 

==Organization==
Five of the eleven volumes deal with [[World War II]], in chronological order.&lt;ref name="s30"&gt;Sánchez, 2002, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Four volumes deal with the humanitarian activities of the [[Holy See]] during the war, also in chronological order.&lt;ref name="s30"/&gt; One covers [[Pope Pius XII]]'s letters to German bishops before and during the war.&lt;ref name="s30"/&gt; The last encompasses documents pertaining to [[Poland]] and [[Baltic States|Baltic]] countries.&lt;ref name="s30"/&gt;

In the ''Actes'', none of the documents&amp;mdash;mostly in [[Italian language|Italian]]&amp;mdash;were translated from their original language.&lt;ref name="s29"/&gt; The introductions to the volumes and the brief descriptions preceding the documents are in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="s29"/&gt; Because the third volume contains two books, the ADSS are sometimes incorrectly referred to as a twelve-volume collection.&lt;ref&gt;Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusions and omissions==
The editors describe the selected documents as a representative sample of Vatican activity during World War II; the four Jesuits claimed that only size constraints prevented them from publishing the full set of documents and that no new important revelations would accompany the eventual complete publication.&lt;ref name="s29"/&gt; 

According to the count of Australian historian Paul O'Shea, the ADSS contains 107 references to Jews prior to December 1942, and substantially more thereafter; a variety of other studies have extensively listed the data received by the Vatican on the nature and extent of the atrocities throughout Europe, as can be confirmed by the ADSS.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article for the Vatican newspaper, ''L'Osservatore Romano'' (April 29, 1998), Father Pierre Blet, the last surviving editor of the series, defended the integrity of the collection. "In the first place, it is not clear exactly how the omission of certain documents would help to exonerate Pius XII from the omissions alleged against him," Blet wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=345&amp;CFID=22782340&amp;CFTOKEN=66971862 Blet, Pierre. "Myth vs. Historical Fact" L'Osservatore Romano, republished at Catholic Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; "On the other hand, to say in peremptory tones that our publication is incomplete is tantamount to asserting what cannot be proved: to this end it would be necessary to compare our publication with the archives and show which documents in the archives are missing from our publication." Blet added that he and three other Jesuits "did not deliberately overlook any significant document, because we would have considered it harmful to the Pope's image and the Holy See's reputation."

==The editors==
The four Jesuit editors also wrote many articles derived from these primary sources, most of which were published in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', an Italian-language Jesuit journal.

===Blet===
Blet's ''Pius XII and the Second World War : According to the Archives of the Vatican'' (1999) represents his interpretation of what essential conclusions can be drawn from the eleven volume collection.

===Graham===
[[Robert A. Graham]]'s research did not stop with the publication of the ADSS; he continued to seek out primary sources within and without the Vatican and interview contemporaries almost until his death.&lt;ref name="pxiv"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; He retired to California, taking his considerable body of records with him; this collection was made open to the public (although rarely actually used) until his death, at which point the Vatican had all the papers returned to Rome and sealed.&lt;ref name="pxiv"/&gt;

==Translations==
As of 2002, only one of the volumes had been translated into English.&lt;ref name="s29"/&gt; In 2012, M. Mallory published an English translation of some of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mallory|first=Marilyn|title=''Pope Pius XII and the Jews:  What's True and What's Fiction?''|year=2012|publisher=Amazon.com|location=Kindle|asin=B006KLOARW |pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

''Agricola I'' is a painted [[steel]] sculpture made of old [[farm machinery]] which have been assembled to appear as a [[farmer]] holding a tool in each hand.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithKrauss"/&gt;

==Acquisition==

The sculpture was originally purchased in 1962 from Park International in [[New York City]]. In 1966 the Hirshhorn Museum's namesake, [[Joseph H. Hirshhorn]] gave the work to the museum.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirshhorn"/&gt;

==Further information==

The ''Agricola'' series includes other works utilizing old farm equipment. The series of sixteen sculptures, made between 1950 and 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |year=2008 |title=David Smith Chronology |work= |publisher=David Smith Estate |url=http://www.davidsmithestate.org/bio.html |accessdate=23 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011213241/http://www.davidsmithestate.org/bio.html |archivedate=11 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; represent Smith's concern with farming in upper [[New York State]] where he lived.&lt;ref name="SmithKrauss"/&gt;

===Mercury===
[[File:Mercury with a Caduceus in the Rotunda (Washington, DC).jpg|thumb|right|''Mercury'' in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]]]]
The sculpture has been described by curators at the [[National Gallery of Art]] as "making a direct reference" to ''Mercury'' as attributed to [[Adrian de Vries]] and "that this ''Mercury'' variation is not an isolated instance in Smith's career," referring to other works such as ''Circles'', ''Wagons'' and ''Sentinels'' by Smith, which are all variations upon work by another artist.&lt;ref name="SmithKrauss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard"&gt;{{cite news |title=David Smith;Legacy of the Mighty Man of Metal |author=Paul Richard |url= |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deemed a "parody" by [[The Washington Post]],&lt;ref name="Ostrow"&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebrating Sculptor David Smith |author=Joanne Ostrow |url= |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=5 November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the catalog of the National Gallery's 1982-1983 exhibition, "David Smith," ''Agricola'' is renamed "''Mercury'' variant" for the duration of the publication.&lt;ref name="SmithKrauss"/&gt; In 1982, NGA curator E.A. Carmean Jr., stated that the Hirshhorn's ''Agricola I'' was a must have for NGA if the work was ever to be deaccessioned.&lt;ref name="Ostrow"/&gt; Art historian and critic [[Rosalind Krauss]] describes ''Agricola I'' as being "a [[wikt:hieratic|hieratic]] image, rigid, frontal, and planar to the point of existing almost solely as a [[silhouette]]; whereas ''Mercury'' is a [[Mannerist]] work of combined elegance and muscularity..." She also points out that ''Mercury'' has nothing to do with the agricultural theme of ''Agricola I''.&lt;ref name="SmithKrauss"/&gt;

===Reception===

Art historian [[Sam Hunter]] described the ''Agricola'' series as "an abrasive, unadorned ''[[art brut]]'' of [[wikt:laconic|laconic]] gesture, almost no discernible style, and yet of an extraordinary lyric intensity."&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Sam|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|year=1957|title=RDavid Smith|journal=The Bulletin of the Museum of Modern Art|volume=25|issue=2|pages=3–36|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|doi= |jstor=4058290}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Independent]] stated that the ''Agricola'' series depicts "primitive figures seem on their way to work the land, but it is hard to tell where the farmers end and where their tools begin."&lt;ref name="Indpendent1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Visual arts |author= |url= |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=20 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1982 review of the National Gallery exhibition, [[The New York Times]] called the ''Agricola'' series "elegantly wrought" and as "giving everyday forms a metaphorical unity,"&lt;ref name="WashingtonTimes1"&gt;{{cite news |title=David Smith seen in his full range and scope |author=Grace Glueck |url= |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=28 November 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio Reading Service===
Founded in 1979 as the Northeast Indiana Radio Reading Service (NEIRRS), the Audio Reading Service is a free broadcast service for people who are blind or have a challenge to reading normal print. Under the leadership of library staff, volunteers read local news, grocery ads, cultural events, obituaries and other features from area newspapers, plus nearly 40 magazines and other publications.

The Audio Reading Service can be heard by a special SCA radio, over a sub-channel frequency provided by [[WBCL]]-FM, which is loaned out at no cost by the library. In addition, it is available via podcast, live web streaming, the Sero mobile app, Tunein Radio, as a secondary audio program (SAP-French) on [[WFWA|PBS 39.4]], and system-wide at select healthcare facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpl.lib.in.us/home/audioreadingservice&lt;/ref&gt;

The Audio Reading Service broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and reaches an estimated 80,000 individuals. It became a part of the Allen County Public Library in 2004, and changed its name to Audio Reading Service in 2015.

===WELT 95.7 FM===
WELT-LP is a non-commercial radio station, produced and delivered by members of the Fort Wayne community. From the studios at the downtown branch of the Allen County Public Library, WELT-LP's volunteers and staff promote programs with news about politics and community issues, plus music and entertainment performed by local, regional and national artists in Fort Wayne venues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acpl.lib.in.us/home/using-the-library/start-here/access-fort-wayne/95-7-welt&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18039">An '''application for employment''' is a standard business document which is prepared with questions deemed relevant by an [[employer]] in order for the employer to determine the best [[candidate]] to be given the responsibility of fulfilling the work needs of the company.  Most companies provide such forms to anyone upon request at which point it becomes the responsibility of the applicant to complete the [[form (document)|form]] and returning it to the employer at will for consideration.  The completed and returned document notifies the company of the applicants availability and desire to be employed and their [[wikt:qualification|qualifications]] and background so a determination can be made as to which candidate should be hired.

[[File:Southmayd letter 1 0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A job application letter dated January 1, 1913]]
[[File:Southmayd letter 2 0.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Rejection letter dated January 16, 1913&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruminski|first1=Clayton|title=Manuscripts and Archives: Early Twentieth Century Job Applications - A Personal Affair|website=Hagley Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Definition==
From the employer's perspective, the application serves a number of purposes. These vary depending on the nature of the job and the preferences of the person responsible for hiring, as "each organization should have an application form that reflects its own environment".&lt;ref name=DA111&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, an application usually requires the applicant to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that he or she is legally permitted to be employed. The typical application also requires the applicant to provide information regarding relevant [[skill]]s, [[education]], and [[experience]] (previous employment or volunteer work). The application itself is a minor test of the applicant's [[literacy]], [[penmanship]], and [[communication skills]] - a careless job applicant might disqualify themselves with a poorly filled-out application.

The application may also require the applicant to disclose any [[criminal record]], and to provide information sufficient to enable the employer to conduct an appropriate [[background check]]. For a business that employs workers on a [[part-time]] basis, the application may inquire as to the applicant's specific times and days of availability, and preferences in this regard. It is important to note, however, that an employer may be prohibited from asking applicants about characteristics that are not relevant to the job, such as their political view or sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=DA111/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Weiss, ''Fair, Square &amp; Legal: Safe Hiring, Managing &amp; Firing Practices to Keep You and Your Company Out of Court'' (2004), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[White-collar worker|white collar]] jobs, particularly those requiring communication skills, the employer will typically require applicants to accompany the form with a [[cover letter]] and a [[résumé]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Bunting, ''The Interviewer's Handbook: Successful Interviewing Techniques for the Workplace'' (2005), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even employers who accept a cover letter and résumé will frequently also require the applicant to complete a form application, as the other documents may neglect to mention details of importance to the employers.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Kennedy, ''The Small Business Owner's Manual'' (2005), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, an application is effectively used to dissuade "walk-in" applicants, serving as a barrier between the applicant and a [[job interview]] with the person with the authority to hire.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Arthur, ''Recruiting, Interviewing, Selecting &amp; Orienting New Employees'' (1998), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many businesses, applications for employment can be filled out online, and do not have to be submitted in person. However, it is still recommended that applicants bring a printed copy of their application to an interview.&lt;ref&gt;A C "Buddy" Krizan, Patricia Merrier, Joyce P. Logan, ''Business Communication'' (2010), p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;

Application blanks are the second most common hiring instrument next to personal interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Tarun|title=Role of Application Blank in the Selection Process|url=http://gradsup.com/application-blank-in-selection-process|publisher=GradsUp|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307052125/http://gradsup.com/application-blank-in-selection-process/|archivedate=2016-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies will occasionally use two types of application blanks, short and long.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} They both help companies with initial screening and the longer form can be used for other purposes as well. The answers that applicants choose to submit are helpful to the company because they can become an interview question for that applicant at a future date.

==Standardization and Regulation==
The employment application is not a standardized form so every company may create its own as long as [[regulations]] set by the government are adhered.  &lt;!-- in the US, this would be EEOD --&gt;

==Document Elements==
Applications usually ask the applicant at the minimum for their name, phone number, and address.  In addition, applications also ask for previous employment information, educational background, emergency contacts, references, as well as any special skills the applicant might have.

The three categories application fields are very useful for discovering are; physical characteristics, experience, and environmental factors.

===Physical characteristics===
If the company has a [[bona fide occupational qualification]] (BFOQ) to ask regarding a physical condition, they may ask questions about it,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} for example:
:The job requires a lot of physical labor. Do you have any physical problems that may interfere with this job?

===Experience===
Experience requirements can be separated into two groups on an application, work experience and educational background.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Educational background is important to companies because by evaluating applicants' performance in school tells them what their personality is like as well as their intelligence. Work experience is important to companies because it will inform the company if the applicant meets their requirements. Companies are usually interested when applicants were unemployed and when/why the applicant left their previous job.

===Socio-environmental qualifications===
Companies are interested in the applicant's [[social environment]] because it can inform them of their personality, interests, and qualities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} If they are extremely active within an organization, that may demonstrate their ability to communicate well with others. Being in management may demonstrate their leadership ability as well as their determination and so on.

===Photograph===
Customs vary internationally when it comes to the inclusion or non-inclusion of a [[photograph]] of the applicant. In the English-speaking countries, notably the United States, this is not customary, and books or websites giving recommendations about how to design an application typically advise against it unless explicitly requested by the employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/should-include-photo-cover-letter-resume-job-application-11576.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229025658/http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/should-include-photo-cover-letter-resume-job-application-11576.html |archivedate=2013-12-29 |df= }}, accessed 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries, for instance Germany, the inclusion of a photograph of the applicant is still common, and many employers would consider an application incomplete without it.

==In other non-English speaking European countries==

===France===
In [[France]], the {{Interlanguage link multi|Equal Opportunities Act (France)|fr|3=Loi pour l'égalité des chances|lt=2006 Equal Opportunities Act}} requires companies with more than 50 employees to request an anonymous application (''{{lang|fr|CV anonyme}}'').

===Germany===
The job application is called ''Bewerbung'' in Germany and usually consists of three parts, such as the ''Anschreiben'', the ''Lebenslauf'' and the ''Zeugnisse''. ''Anschreiben'' is the German word for [[Cover Letter]] and aims at the same goal: convincing the employer to submit an invitation for a [[job interview]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tt-bewerbungsservice.de/applying-in-germany.html |title=Applying in Germany,  Bewerbung: Anschreiben and Lebenslauf |publisher=T. Tauber (German) |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329023800/http://www.tt-bewerbungsservice.de/applying-in-germany.html |archivedate=2015-03-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is essential to work with the paper size [[DIN A4]] and to stay with a length of one single page. The ''Anschreiben'' must be signed by hand and accompanied by a ''Lebenslauf'', the [[Curriculum Vitae]], and ''Zeugnisse'' as copies of relevant reference documents. The ''Lebenslauf'' is of an anti-chronological structure and should give information on work experience, education and [[professional training]] as well as on applicant's skills. In Germany, the ''Lebenslauf'' – respectively the Curriculum Vitae – usually includes a photograph called ''Bewerbungsfoto''. Some employers, mainly governmental organisations, deliberately neglect the [[photograph]] to ensure a higher degree of objectivity in the course of assessment procedures. A length of two pages is to be aimed at when generating the ''Lebenslauf''. In general, there are two options of submitting a job application in Germany: a job application folder (''Bewerbungsmappe'') or online (''Onlinebewerbung''). According to a study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bitkom.org/de/presse/74532_70955.aspx |title=Internet überholt die Bewerbungsmappe auf Papier |publisher=BITKOM (German) |accessdate=2015-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402122506/http://www.bitkom.org/de/presse/74532_70955.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Onlinebewerbung'' was more favored in Germany than the ''Bewerbungsmappe'' by 2012. Presumably, this development will persist..

===Italy===
The CV is the most important part of the application and should not be longer than two to three pages. It is divided into three areas:

in chronological order
* Details of the person (Informazioni personali)
* School and education (Studi e Formazione)

in anti-chronological order
* additional capabilities (Altre conoscenze) 
* Experience (Esperienze professionali). As graduate this section is omitted. Brief information on the application motivations may be mentioned here.

The application letter (La Lettera di accompagnamento al curriculum) will be taken relatively short, polite and formal in Italian applications. Long versions and extensively explained motivations, as well as photos and copies of certificates shall be presented only at the interview.

===Spain===
In Spain, the application consists of two parts: the cover letter (''Carta de Candidatura'') and the CV. No work or training certificates are attached. The cover letter should contain information on the motivation and drafted shortly. The CV should be structured in a tabular form. In Spain, multiple job interviews in the same company are common.

==Usage by hackers==
Job applications are known to be used by hackers to get employees to open [[Email attachment|attachments]] or links or connect [[USB_flash_drive_security#Malware_infections|USB sticks]] with [[malware]]. As companies typically have more financial resources than private individuals they are often a target of [[cyberextortion]] − so called [[ransomware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindner|first1=Martin|title=Computerkriminalität: Hacker im Spital|url=https://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/computerkriminalitaet-hacker-im-spital-ld.143720|publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=de|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209002241/https://www.nzz.ch/nzzas/nzz-am-sonntag/computerkriminalitaet-hacker-im-spital-ld.143720|archivedate=9 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warning: Malware is showing up in job applicants’ files|url=http://www.hrmorning.com/warning-malware-is-showing-up-in-job-applicants-files/|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=1 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081457/http://www.hrmorning.com/warning-malware-is-showing-up-in-job-applicants-files/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ransomware such as "Petya"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Email scam Petya locks down PCs until a ransom is paid|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/petya-malware/|publisher=Digital Trends|accessdate=9 February 2017|date=25 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081954/http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/petya-malware/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angebliches Bewerbungsschreiben: Ransomware Petya verschlüsselt Master File Table|url=http://www.zdnet.de/88264556/angebliches-bewerbungsschreiben-ransomware-petya-verschluesselt-master-file-table/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=de-DE|date=29 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080450/http://www.zdnet.de/88264556/angebliches-bewerbungsschreiben-ransomware-petya-verschluesselt-master-file-table/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "GoldenEye"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoldenEye ransomware disguised as job application|url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/malware/27866/goldeneye-ransomware-disguised-as-job-application|publisher=IT PRO|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211081426/http://www.itpro.co.uk/malware/27866/goldeneye-ransomware-disguised-as-job-application|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Palmer|first1=Danny|title=This ransomware targets HR departments with fake job applications|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-targets-hr-departments-with-fake-job-applications/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=9 February 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080335/http://www.zdnet.com/article/this-ransomware-targets-hr-departments-with-fake-job-applications/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GoldenEye Ransomware analysiert|url=http://www.security-insider.de/goldeneye-ransomware-analysiert-a-577610/|accessdate=9 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080937/http://www.security-insider.de/goldeneye-ransomware-analysiert-a-577610/|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ziemann|first1=Frank|title=Goldeneye: Bewerbungs-Mails mit Erpresser-Malware|url=http://www.pcwelt.de/news/Bewerbungs-Mails-mit-Erpresser-Malware-10088421.html|publisher=PC-WELT|accessdate=9 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211080641/http://www.pcwelt.de/news/Bewerbungs-Mails-mit-Erpresser-Malware-10088421.html|archivedate=11 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were found to make use of job applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1521">The '''''Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch''''' (abbrev. '''B.A.J.''') is an astronomical [[ephemeris]] [[almanac]] and the longest publication series in [[astronomy]]. It was a compendium of [[ephemerides]] of all large [[Solar system|Solar System]] bodies and of [[fundamental stars]] which define the celestial reference system.

The ''B.A.J.'' series began in 1776 and continued until 1960 when it was merged into the international edition of the ''[[Astronomical Ephemeris]]'' and ''[[Apparent Places of Fundamental Stars]]'' (APFS). This merger was decided in 1959 by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]].

Starting in 1907 it contained accurate [[apparent places]] of the first international [[fundamental catalogue]] which was compiled for [[astrometry]]; later these data were actualized within the framework of the [[Catalogues of Fundamental Stars]] [[FK3]] and [[FK4]].

In the 1940s the Almanac was edited in co-operation with the ''Astronomisch-Geodätisches Jahrbuch'' of the [[Astronomisches Rechen-Institut|Recheninstitut]] in [[Heidelberg]], Germany, which was also merged into the IAU editions like other national almanacs.

The '''Museum Collection Centre''' ('''MCC''') in [[Nechells]], [[Birmingham]], England is a 1.5 hectare building that holds 80% of [[Birmingham Museums Trust]]'s stored collections under one roof. It is one of the UK's largest museum stores.&lt;ref name="heritageopendays"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Heritage Open Days]]|title=Open Day at the Museum Collections Centre, Birmingham|url=http://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/directory/open-day-at-the-museum-collections-centre-birmingham|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918063802/http://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/directory/open-day-at-the-museum-collections-centre-birmingham|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 September 2014|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the thousands of objects stored there are [[steam engines]] (many of which are from the former [[Birmingham Museum of Science and Industry]]), sculptures, a collection of [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]], [[Rover (marque)|Rover]] and [[The MG Car Company Limited|MG]] motor cars, a [[red phone box]] and a [[Sinclair C5]].

It opens to the public monthly, or by arrangement. There are also other open days, which tend to take place during the Spring and Summer Bank Holidays.&lt;ref name="MCCwhatson"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Birmingham Museums Trust]]|title=Museum Collection Centre|url=http://www.birminghammuseums.org.uk/collection/museum-collection-centre|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum Collection Centre is also home to The Museum in a Box service which enables schools and community groups to borrow original artefacts.

In September 2014 then-trainee curator Lukas Large uncovered a taxidermied specimen of the long extinct North American [[passenger pigeon]] (''Ectopistes migratorius'') in the collection.&lt;ref name="MCCPassengerPigeon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bentley|first1=David|title=Extinct bird rediscovered in Birmingham museum storage building|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/extinct-bird-rediscovered-birmingham-museum-7738735|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Timeline of web browsers.svg|thumb|right|A timeline of web browsers]]
&lt;!--Outdated? says "to present" but seems to be "Data from September 2012": [[File:Web-browser usage on Wikimedia.svg|right|thumb|[[Usage share of web browsers#Wikimedia .28April 2009 to present.29|Usage share of web browsers]]]] --&gt;{{Tone}}

A '''browser war''' is competition for dominance in the [[usage share of web browsers]]. The First Browser War was [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] against [[Netscape]]'s [[Netscape Navigator|Navigator]] during the late 1990s. Browser wars continued with the decline of Internet Explorer's market share since 2003 and the increasing popularity of other browsers including [[Firefox]], [[Google Chrome]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]].

With the introduction of [[HTML5]] and [[CSS 3]], a new generation of '''browser war''' began, this time adding extensive [[client-side scripting]] to the [[World Wide Web]], as well as more widespread use of [[smartphone]]s and other [[Mobile operating system|mobile devices]] for browsing the web. These newcomers have ensured that browser battles continue among enthusiasts, while the average web user is less affected by their choice of browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/did-the-browser-wars-finally-end-in-2014/|title=Did the browser wars finally end in 2014?|quote=Over the past decade, a lot has changed: Mobile devices now outnumber traditional PCs, and the desktop browser has become much less important than mobile web clients and apps. Apple's mobile Safari and Google's Chrome are now major players, Mozilla is in a time of major transition, and Microsoft is still paying for its past sins with Internet Explorer.&lt;br /&gt;And in 2014, all those players seem to have dug in to well-entrenched positions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Layout engine usage share-2009-01-07.svg|thumb|300px| Usage share as of Q2 2009 by percent of layout engines/web browsers]]{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The [[World Wide Web]] is an [[Internet]]-based [[hypertext]] system invented in the late 1980s and early 1990s by [[Tim Berners-Lee]]. Berners-Lee wrote the first web browser [[WorldWideWeb]], later renamed Nexus, and released it for the [[NeXTstep]] platform in 1991.

By the end of 1992 other browsers had appeared, many of them based on the [[libwww]] library. These included [[Unix]] browsers such as [[Line Mode Browser]], [[ViolaWWW]], [[Erwise]], and [[MidasWWW]], and [[MacWWW]]/Samba for the Mac. Even though these browsers tended to be simple HTML viewers, relying on external [[helper application]]s to view multimedia content, they provided choice to users both in browsers and platforms.

==Mosaic Wars==
Further browsers were released in 1993, including [[Cello (web browser)|Cello]], [[Arena (web browser)|Arena]], [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]], [[tkWWW]], and [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]]. The most influential of these was Mosaic, a multiplatform browser developed at [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] (NCSA). By October 1994, Mosaic was "well on its way to becoming the world's standard interface", according to Gary Wolfe of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.10/mosaic.html |title=The (Second Phase of the) Revolution Has Begun |date=October 1994 |accessdate=2012-04-24 |last=Wolfe |first=Gary |publisher=Wired Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several companies licensed Mosaic to create their own commercial browsers, such as [[AirMosaic]] and [[Spyglass Mosaic]]. One of the Mosaic developers, [[Marc Andreessen]], co-founded the Mosaic Communications Corporation and created a new web browser named Mosaic Netscape.

{{quote|There are two ages of the Internet—before Mosaic, and after. The combination of Tim Berners-Lee's Web protocols, which provided connectivity, and Marc Andreesen's browser, which provided a great interface, proved explosive. In twenty-four months, the Web has gone from being unknown to absolutely ubiquitous.&lt;ref name="A Brief History of Cyberspace"&gt;{{cite web | title=A Brief History of Cyberspace | publisher=ZDNet | first=Mark | last=Pesce | date=October 15, 1995 | url=http://www.zdnet.com/zdi/vrml/content/960125/pesce1.html | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014005303/http://www.zdnet.com/zdi/vrml/content/960125/pesce1.html | archivedate=2008-10-14 | accessdate=February 6, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

To resolve legal issues with NCSA, the company was renamed [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] and the browser [[Netscape Navigator]]. The Netscape browser improved on Mosaic's usability and reliability and was able to display pages as they loaded. By 1995, helped by the fact that it was free for non-commercial use, the browser dominated the emerging World Wide Web.

Other browsers launched during 1994 included [[IBM Web Explorer]], [[Navipress]], [[SlipKnot (web browser)|SlipKnot]], [[MacWeb]], and [[Browse (web browser)|Browse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berghel|first=Hal|title=Hal Berghel's Cybernautica|url=http://berghel.net/col-edit/cybernautica/jan-feb96/pcai961.php|accessdate=14 November 2010|date=2 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Netscape faced new competition from [[OmniWeb]], [[WebRouser]], [[UdiWWW]], and Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer 1.0]], but continued to dominate the market.

By mid-1995 the World Wide Web had received a great deal of attention in [[popular culture]] and the [[mass media]]. Netscape Navigator was the most widely used web browser and Microsoft had licensed Mosaic to create Internet Explorer 1.0,&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/january/new0122d.htm |title=MICROSOFT'S $8 MILLION GOODBYE TO SPYGLASS |accessdate=9 February 2011 |first=Peter |last=Elstrom |date=22 January 1997 |publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970629174318/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/january/new0122d.htm |archivedate=29 June 1997 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="win"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/news2/microsoft-and-spyglass-kiss-and-make-up.aspx|title=Microsoft and Spyglass kiss and make up|publisher=[[WindowsITPro]]|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Thurrott|date=22 January 1997|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it had released as part of the Microsoft [[Windows 95]] [[Microsoft Plus!|Plus!]] pack in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryIE.mspx |title=Windows History: Internet Explorer History |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=2003-06-30 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet Explorer 2.0]] was released as a free download three months later. Unlike Netscape Navigator, it was available to all Windows users free of charge, this also applying to commercial companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://news.microsoft.com/1996/04/30/microsoft-internet-explorer-web-browser-available-on-all-major-platforms-offers-broadest-international-support/|title=Microsoft Internet Explorer Web Browser Available on All Major Platforms, Offers Broadest International Support|publisher=Microsoft|date=30 April 1996|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies later followed suit and released their browsers free of charge.&lt;ref name="pcgo" /&gt; Both Netscape Navigator and competitor products like [[InternetWorks]], [[Quarterdeck Browser]], [[InterAp]], and [[WinTapestry]] were bundled with other applications to full [[Internet suite]]s.&lt;ref name="pcgo"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.well.com/user/oink/oinkxweb/snippets/g7-bxls/webwar3.htm|accessdate=25 February 2011|title=Web-Wars|journal=[[PC Week]]|date=20 February 1995|first=Jesse|last=Berst|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718025042/http://www.well.com/user/oink/oinkxweb/snippets/g7-bxls/webwar3.htm|archivedate=18 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape (branded as [[Netscape Communicator]]) were released at a rapid pace over the following few years.

Development was rapid and new features were routinely added, including Netscape's [[JavaScript]] (subsequently replicated by Microsoft as [[JScript]]) and proprietary HTML tags such as &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;[[Blink element|blink]]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;[[Marquee element|marquee]]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

Internet Explorer began to approach feature parity with Netscape with version 3.0 (1996), which offered scripting support and the market's first commercial [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) implementation.

In October 1997, [[Internet Explorer 4.0]] was released. The release party in San Francisco featured a ten-foot-tall letter "e" logo. Netscape employees showing up to work the following morning found the logo on their front lawn, with a sign attached that read "From the IE team ...{{cns|text=We Love You.|date=August 2018}}" The Netscape employees promptly knocked it over and set a giant figure of their [[Mozilla (mascot)|Mozilla]] dinosaur mascot atop it, holding a sign reading "Netscape 72, Microsoft 18" representing the market distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.snafu.de/tilman/mozilla/stomps.html |title=Mozilla stomps IE |publisher=Home.snafu.de |date=1997-10-02 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 4 changed the tides of the browser wars. It was integrated into Microsoft Windows, which gave it a large installation base.

During these releases, it was common for web designers to display 'best viewed in Netscape' or 'best viewed in Internet Explorer' logos.  These images often identified a specific browser version and were commonly linked to a source from which the stated browser could be downloaded.  These logos generally recognized the divergence between the standards supported by the browsers and signified which browser was used for testing the pages. In response, supporters of the principle that web sites should be compliant with [[World Wide Web Consortium]] standards and hence viewable with any browser started the "Viewable With Any Browser" campaign, which employed its own logo similar to the partisan ones. Most mainstream web sites, however, specified one of Netscape or IE as their preferred browser while making some attempt to support minimal functionality on the other.

===Internet Explorer 5 and 6===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
{{POV section|date=November 2017}}
Microsoft had three strong advantages in the browser wars.

One was resources: Netscape began with about 80% market share and a good deal of public goodwill, but as a relatively small company deriving the great bulk of its income from what was essentially a single product (Navigator and its derivatives), it was financially vulnerable. Netscape's total revenue never exceeded the interest income generated by Microsoft's funds that were readily available for use. Microsoft's resources allowed them to make Internet Explorer available without charge, as the revenues from Windows were used to fund its development and marketing. Netscape was commercial software for businesses, but was provided free for home and educational use; Internet Explorer was provided free for all Windows and Macintosh users, cutting off a significant revenue stream; as it was told by [[Jim Barksdale]], President and CEO of Netscape Communications: "Very few times in warfare have smaller forces overtaken bigger forces...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=4 |title=Roads and Crossroads of the Internet History |work=NetValley.com|date= |accessdate=2011-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage was that Microsoft Windows had over 90% share of the desktop operating system market. Internet Explorer was bundled with every copy of Windows, therefore Microsoft was able to obtain an advantage the market share more easily than Netscape, as customers had Internet Explorer as the default browser. In this time period, many new computer purchases were first computer purchases for home users or offices, and many of the users had never extensively used a web browser before. Consequently, the buyer did not have anything else to compare with and little motivation to consider alternatives; the set of abilities they had gained with access to the Internet and the World Wide Web made any difference in browser features or ergonomics pale in comparison.

During the [[United States Microsoft antitrust case]] in 1998, government witness and [[Intel]] vice president [[Steven McGeady]] testified that a senior executive at Microsoft told him in 1995 of his company's intention to "cut off Netscape's air supply", although a Microsoft attorney [[Hearsay|rejected McGeady's testimony as not credible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/longterm/microsoft/stories/1998/microsoft111398.htm |title=Microsoft Attacks Credibility of Intel Exec |date=November 1998 |accessdate=2009-12-01 |last=Chandrasekaran |first=Rajiv |publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Netscape, the company, was acquired by [[AOL|America Online]] for [[United States dollar|US$]]4.2&amp;nbsp;billion. Internet Explorer became the new dominant browser, attaining a peak of about 96% of the [[usage share of web browsers|web browser usage share]] during 2002.

The first browser war ended with Internet Explorer having no remaining serious competition for its market share. This also brought an end to the rapid innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one new version of Internet Explorer since [[Internet Explorer 6|version 6.0]] had been released in 2001. Internet Explorer 6.0 Service Pack 1 was developed as part of [[Windows XP Service Pack 1]] and was also integrated into [[Windows Server 2003]]. Further enhancements were made to Internet Explorer in [[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] (released in 2004), including a pop-up blocker and stronger default security settings regarding the installation of ActiveX controls.

==Second Browser War: 2004-2018==
[[File:Wikipedia Main Page in Firefox 2.0.0.12.png|thumb|Firefox 2.0, shown here, was released in October 2006.]]

At the start of Netscape Navigator's decline, Netscape open-sourced their browser code, and later entrusted it to the newly formed non-profit [[Mozilla Foundation]]&amp;mdash;a primarily community-driven project to create a successor to Netscape. Development continued for several years with little widespread adoption until a stripped-down browser-only version of the full suite, which included new features such as a separate search bar (which had previously only appeared in the Opera browser), was created. The browser-only version was initially named ''[[Mozilla Phoenix|Phoenix]]'', but because of [[History of Firefox#Naming|trademark issues]] that name was changed, first to ''Firebird'', then to ''[[Firefox]]''. This browser became the focus of the Mozilla Foundation's development efforts and Mozilla Firefox 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004. It then continued to gain an increasing share of the browser market until a peak in 2010.

In 2003, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 would be the last standalone version of its browser. Future enhancements would be dependent on [[Windows Vista]], which would include new tools such as the [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] and [[Extensible Application Markup Language|XAML]] to enable developers to build web applications.

In response, in April 2004, the Mozilla Foundation and [[Opera Software]] joined efforts to develop new open technology standards which add more capability while remaining backward-compatible with existing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/2004/04/webapps-cdf-ws/papers/opera.html |title=Position Paper for the W3C Workshop on Web Applications and Compound Documents |publisher=W3.org |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this collaboration was the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group|WHATWG]], a working group devoted to the fast creation of new standard definitions that would be submitted to the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] for approval.

The growing number of device/browser combinations in use, legally-mandated [[web accessibility]], as well as the expansion of expected web functionality to essentially require DOM and scripting abilities, including AJAX, made [[web standards]] of increasing importance during this era. Instead of touting their proprietary extensions, browser developers began to market their software based on how closely it adhered to the behavior as specified by the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/The_Business_Benefits_of_Web_Standards|title=The Business Benefits of Web Standards|quote=In such an increasingly heterogeneous environment, testing each web page in every configuration is impossible. Coding to standards is then the only practical solution.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Updated browsers released and the rise of mobile use ===
[[File:Usage share of web browsers (Source StatCounter).svg|left|thumb|[[Usage share of web browsers]] according to [[StatCounter]] ]]
On February 15, 2005, Microsoft announced that [[Internet Explorer 7]] would be available for Windows XP SP2 and later versions of Windows by mid-2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/02/15/373104.aspx |title=IEBlog : IE7 |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement introduced the new version of the browser as a major upgrade over Internet Explorer 6 SP1.

Opera had been a long-time small player in the browser wars, known for introducing innovative features such as tabbed browsing and mouse gestures, as well as being lightweight but [[feature-rich]]. The software, however, was commercial, which hampered its adoption compared to its free rivals until 2005, when the browser became [[freeware]]. On June 20, 2006, Opera Software released [[Opera 9]] including an integrated source viewer, a [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] client implementation, and widgets. It was the first Windows browser to pass the [[Acid2]] test. [[Opera Mini]], a mobile browser, has significant mobile market share. Editions of Opera are also available for the [[Nintendo DS &amp; DSi Browser|Nintendo DS]] and the [[Internet Channel|Wii]].

Microsoft released Internet Explorer 7 on October 18, 2006. It included tabbed browsing, a search bar, a [[phishing]] filter, and improved support for web standards (including full support for [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]])—all features already long familiar to Opera and Firefox users. Microsoft distributed Internet Explorer 7 to [[Windows Genuine Advantage|genuine Windows users]] (WGA) as a high-priority update through [[Windows Update]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evers |first=Joris |url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft+tags+IE+7+high+priority+update/2100-7350_3-6098500.html |title=Microsoft tags IE 7 'high priority' update &amp;#124; CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical market share analysis showed only a slow uptake of Internet Explorer 7 and Microsoft decided to drop the requirement for WGA and made Internet Explorer 7 available to all Windows users in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/10/04/internet-explorer-7-update.aspx |title=IEBlog: Internet Explorer 7 Update |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date= |accessdate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the two following years, Microsoft worked on [[Internet Explorer 8]]. On December 19, 2007, the company announced that an internal build of that version had passed the [[Acid2]] CSS test in "IE8 standards mode"—the last of the major browsers to do so.  Internet Explorer 8 was released on March 19, 2009.  New features included [[Selection-based search|accelerators]], improved privacy protection, a compatibility mode for pages designed for older browsers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/newsroom/windows/factsheets/ie8fs.mspx |title=Window Internet Explorer 8 Fact Sheet |date=March 2009|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved support for various web standards.  It was the last version of Internet Explorer to be released for [[Windows XP]].  Internet Explorer 8 scored 20/100 in the [[Acid3]] test, which was much worse than all major competitors at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Presto and WebKit-based browsers scored 100 in 2008, with Firefox scoring 93 in June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2006, Mozilla released Mozilla Firefox 2.0. It included the ability to reopen recently closed tabs, a session restore feature to resume work where it had been left after a crash, a phishing filter, and a spell-checker for text fields.  Mozilla released [[Mozilla Firefox 3|Firefox 3.0]] on June 17, 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with performance improvements and other new features. [[Mozilla Firefox 3.5|Firefox 3.5]] followed on June 30, 2009, with further performance improvements, native integration of audio and video, and more privacy features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techseoguru.com/mozilla-advances-web-firefox-3-5/  |title=Mozilla Advances the Web with Firefox 3.5 |publisher=Mozilla Europe and Mozilla Foundation |accessdate=2009-10-12 }}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] created [[software fork|forks]] of the open-source [[KHTML]] and [[KJS (KDE)|KJS]] layout and JavaScript engines from the [[KDE]] [[Konqueror]] browser in 2002. They explained that those provided a basis for easier development than other technologies by virtue of being small (fewer than 140,000 [[lines of code]]), cleanly designed, and standards-compliant.&lt;ref name="macport"&gt;KDE KFM-Devel mailing list "[http://lists.kde.org/?l=kfm-devel&amp;m=104197092318639&amp;w=2 (fwd) Greetings from the Safari team at Apple Computer]", January 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting [[Browser engine|layout engine]] became known as [[WebKit]] and it was incorporated into the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] browser that first shipped with [[Mac OS X v10.3]]. On June 13, 2003, Microsoft said it was discontinuing Internet Explorer on the Mac platform and on June 6, 2007, Apple released a beta version of Safari for Microsoft Windows. On April 29, 2010, [[Steve Jobs]] wrote open letter regarding his [[Thoughts on Flash]], and the place it would hold on Apple's [[iOS]] devices and [[web browsers]]. [[Web developer]]s were tasked with updating their [[web sites]] to be mobile friendly, and while many disagreed with [[Steve Jobs]]'s assessment on [[Adobe Flash]], history would soon prove his case in point with [[Thoughts on Flash|notable mentions]] of poor performance of [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. [[HTML4]] and [[CSS2]] were the standard in most browsers in 2006. However, new features being added to browsers from [[HTML5]] and [[CSS3]] specifications were quickly making their mark by 2010, especially in the emerging [[mobile browser]] market where new ways of animating and rendering for various screen sizes were to become the norm. Accessibility would also become a key player for the mobile web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/overlap.html|title=Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web: Making a Website Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Mobile Devices|accessdate= 2012-08-31|work=W3C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalgov.gov/2013/07/31/mobile-product-accessibility-testing-resources/|title=Mobile Product Accessibility Testing Resources|accessdate=2013-07-31|work=Digital.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/when-it-comes-to-accessibility-apple-continues-to-lead-in-awareness-and-innovation/|title=When it comes to accessibility, Apple continues to lead in awareness and innovation|accessdate=2016-05-19|work=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, 2007, Netscape announced that support for its Mozilla-derived Netscape Navigator would be discontinued on February 1, 2008, suggesting its users migrate to Mozilla Firefox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://blog.netscape.com/2007/12/28/end-of-support-for-netscapeweb-browsers/|title= The Netscape Blog|accessdate=2007-12-28 |work= Netscape, AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, on January 28, 2008, Netscape announced that support would be extended to March 1, 2008, and mentioned [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]] alongside Firefox as alternatives to its users.

[[Google]] released the [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] browser for Microsoft Windows on December 11, 2008, using the same WebKit rendering engine as Safari and a faster JavaScript engine called V8. Shortly after, an open-sourced version for the Windows, OS X, and Linux platforms was released under the name [[Chromium (web browser)|Chromium]].  According to Net Applications, Chrome had gained a 3.6% usage share by October 2009. After the release of the beta for Mac OS X and Linux, the market share had increased rapidly.&lt;ref name="market-share"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

During December 2009 and January 2010, ''[[StatCounter]]'' reported that its statistics indicated that Firefox 3.5 was the most popular browser, when counting individual browser versions, passing Internet Explorer 7 and 8 by a small margin.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/188906.asp?from=blog_last3 Firefox 3.5 is world's most popular browser, StatCounter says], Nick Eaton. seattlepi blogs. 2009-12-21. Retrieved 2009-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-200902-201006|title=StatCounter global stats – Top 12 browser versions|publisher=StatCounter|accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time a global statistic has reported that a non-Internet Explorer browser version had exceeded the top Internet Explorer version in usage share since the fall of Netscape Navigator. This feat, which GeekSmack called the "dethroning of Microsoft and its Internet Explorer 7 browser,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geeksmack.net/internet/910-firefox-35-surpasses-ie7-market-share |title=Firefox 3.5 surpasses IE7 market share |publisher=Geeksmack.net |date=2009-12-22 |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526190848/http://geeksmack.net/internet/910-firefox-35-surpasses-ie7-market-share |archivedate=2010-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; could largely be attributed to the fact that it came at a time when version 8 was replacing version 7 as the dominant Internet Explorer version. No more than two months later Internet Explorer 8 had established itself as the most popular browser version, a position which it still held as of March 2011. And other major statistics, such as [[Net Applications]], never reported any non-Internet Explorer browser version as having a higher usage share than the most popular Internet Explorer version, although Firefox 3.5 was reported as the third most popular browser version between December 2009 and February 2010, to be replaced by Firefox 3.6 since April 2010, each ahead of Internet Explorer 7 and behind Internet Explorer 6 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=3 |title=Browser market share trend |publisher=Marketshare.hitslink.com |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTML5 beginnings, Presto rendering engine deprecation and Chrome's dominance===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
On January 21, 2010, Mozilla released [[Mozilla Firefox 3.6]], which allows support for a new type of theme display, 'Personas', which allows users to change Firefox's appearance with a single click. Version 3.6 also improves JavaScript performance, overall browser responsiveness, and startup times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.6/releasenotes/ |title=Mozilla Firefox 3.6 Release Notes |publisher=Mozilla.com |date=2010-01-21 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, StatCounter reported that Internet Explorer had for the first time dropped below 50% market share to 49.87% in their figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200909-201009|title=Microsoft Internet Explorer browser falls below 50% of worldwide market for first time|publisher=StatCounter|accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, StatCounter reported Internet Explorer 8's first drop in usage share in the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-200910-201010|title=StatCounter Browser Versions form Oct 09 to Oct 10|publisher=StatCounter|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google released [[Google Chrome]] 9 on February 3, 2011. New features introduced included support for [[WebGL]], Chrome Instant, and the Chrome Web Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrome.blogspot.com/2011/02/dash-of-speed-3d-and-apps.html |title=Google Chrome Blog |publisher=chrome.blogspot.com |date=2011-02-03 |accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company created another seven versions of Chrome that year, finishing with Chrome 16 on December 15, 2011.  The first version of Chrome available to the public in 2012 was Chrome 17, which was released on February 15, 2012.  In April 2012, Google browsers (Chrome and Android) became the most used browsers on [[Wikimedia Foundation]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://stats.wikimedia.org/archive/squid_reports/2012-04/SquidReportClients.htm|title=Wikimedia Traffic Analysis Report - Browsers e.a.|publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]]|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 21, 2012, [[StatCounter]] reported Chrome narrowly overtaking Internet Explorer as the most used browser in the world.&lt;ref name="google_chrome_overtakes_internet_explorer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/255886/google_chrome_overtakes_internet_explorer.html|title=Google Chrome Overtakes Internet Explorer|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, troughs and peaks in the market share between Internet Explorer and Chrome meant that Internet Explorer was slightly ahead of Chrome on weekdays up until July 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-daily-20120301-20120731|title=StatCounter Global Stats - Browser, OS, Search Engine including Mobile Usage Share|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Net Applications]] reported Internet Explorer firmly in first place, with Google Chrome almost overtaking Firefox as the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=1&amp;qpcustomb=0&amp;qpsp=158&amp;qpnp=5&amp;qptimeframe=M |title=Browser market share |website=Netmarketshare.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, responding to Chrome's popularity, Apple discontinued Safari for Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ubuntulife.net/apple-discontinues-safari-for-windows/|title=Apple Discontinues Safari Development for Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft released [[Internet Explorer 9]] on March 14, 2011. It featured a revamped interface, support for the basic [[SVG]] feature set, and partial [[HTML5 video]] support, among other new features. It only runs on [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], and [[Windows Phone 7]].  The company later released [[Internet Explorer 10]] along with [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Phone 8]] in 2012, and an update compatible with [[Windows 7]] followed in 2013.  This version drops Vista and Phone 7 support.  The release preview of [[Internet Explorer 11]] was released on September 17, 2013. It supports the same desktops as its predecessor.

The concept of rapid releases established by Google Chrome prompted Mozilla to do the same for its Firefox browser.  On June 21, 2011, Firefox 5.0 was the first rapid release for this browser, finished a mere six weeks after the previous edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2011/08/26/rapidity/ |title=Rapidity &amp;#124; Future Releases |website=Blog.mozilla.org |date=2011-08-26 |accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mozilla created four more whole-number versions throughout the year, finishing with Firefox 9 on December 20, 2011.  For those desiring [[long term support]], Mozilla made an Extended Support Release (ESR) version of [[Firefox 10]] on January 31, 2012.  Contrary to the regular version, a Firefox ESR receives regular security updates plus occasional new features and performance updates for approximately one year, after which a 12-week grace period is given before discontinuing that version number.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Those who continued to use the rapid releases with an active Internet connection were automatically updated to Firefox 11 on March 15, 2012. By the end of 2011 however Chrome overtook Firefox to become world's most used browser, and the competition between Chrome and Firefox intensified.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/press/chrome-overtakes-firefox-globally-for-first-time&lt;/ref&gt;

During this era, all major web browsers implemented support for [[HTML5 video]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Supported codecs, however, varied from browser to browser. Current versions of Android, Chrome, and Firefox support Theora, H.264, and the VP8 version of WebM. Older versions of Firefox omitted H.264 due to it being a proprietary codec, but it was made available beginning in version 17 for Android and version 20 for Windows. Internet Explorer and Safari support H.264 exclusively,{{when|date=October 2017}} but the Theora and VP8 codecs can be manually installed on the desktop versions. Given the popularity of WebKit for mobile browsers, [[Opera Software]] discontinued its own Presto engine in February 2013. The Opera 12 series of browsers were the last to use Presto with its successors using WebKit instead. In 2015, Microsoft discontinued production of newer versions of [[Internet Explorer]]. By this point Chrome overtook all other browsers as the browser with the highest usage share.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com.au/microsoft-discontinue-internet-explorer-launch-new-browser-windows-10-1430604&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2016/01/the-sorry-legacy-of-microsoft-internet-explorer/&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2015 with the release of [[Windows 10]], Microsoft shifted from [[Internet Explorer]] to [[Microsoft Edge]]. However the new browser has failed to capture much popularity as of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.zdnet.com/article/in-the-new-browser-war-microsoft-edge-is-losing-internet-explorer/&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2017 usage shares of Opera, Firefox and Internet Explorer fell well below 5% each, while Google Chrome had expanded to over 60% worldwide. In May 26, 2017 [[Andreas Gal]], former Mozilla [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] publicly stated that Google Chrome won the Second Browser War.&lt;ref&gt;https://andreasgal.com/2017/05/25/chrome-won/&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2018, combining all types of devices using the internet, Google Chrome remains the most used browser across the world by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share#monthly-201707-201707-map&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. RD Legal Funding, LLC''''' was a lawsuit by the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB) and the [[Attorney General of New York]] against Defendants RD Legal Funding, LLC, RD Legal Finance, LLC, RD Legal Funding Partners, LP and Roni Dersovitz, the founder and owner of the RD Entities.
On June 21, 2018, Senior U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska held that Title X of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], which established the CFPB as an independent bureau within the [[Federal Reserve System]], is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/cases/show.php?db=special&amp;id=634|title=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. RD Legal Funding LLC|website=Nysd.uscourts.gov|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This holding is in contrast with the ''[[en banc]]'' holding of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] in ''PHH Corp. v. CFPB'', 881 F.3d 75 (D.C. Cir. 2018) and partially adopts the separate dissents of Judge [[Brett Kavanaugh]] and Judge [[Karen L. Henderson]] in that case.

'''DNS Long-Lived Queries''' is a mechanism that allows [[DNS]] clients to learn about changes to DNS data without [[Polling (computer science)|polling]].&lt;ref name="DNS-LLQ-1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheshire|first=Stuart|title=DNS Long-Lived Queries|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sekar-dns-llq-01|publisher=IETF|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNS LLQ is currently used by [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[Back To My Mac]] (BTMM) service to track changes in the IP addresses of BTMM servers and clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheshire|first=Stuart|title=Understanding Apple's Back to My Mac (BTMM) Service|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6281|publisher=IETF|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
DNS LLQ has also been proposed as a solution for doing [[DNS-SD|DNS-Based Service Discovery]] (DNS-SD) on routed networks, using long-lived [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP/IP]] connections.
DNS-SD is a mechanism for identifying services on the local network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheshire|first=Stuart|title=DNS-Based Service Discovery|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763|publisher=IETF|accessdate=3 March 2014|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;   DNS-SD is typically used to present names of services (for example, printers or file servers) in user interfaces.   DNS Long-Lived Queries (DNS-LLQ) can be used for DNS-SD to allow new services to appear automatically in an active user interface without requiring frequent polling.  DNS-LLQ is being proposed in the [[IETF]] DNSSD working group as one option for providing service discovery in these routed networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhandari|first=Schweta|title=Extending Multicast DNS across Local Links in Campus and Enterprise Networks|url=http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bhandari-dnssd-mdns-gateway/|publisher=IETF}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Although DNS LLQ over TCP/IP has not been standardized, it is in use in Apple Inc.'s current [[mDNS]] implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Private DNS|url=https://opensource.apple.com/source/mDNSResponder/mDNSResponder-320.10/PrivateDNS.txt|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNS LLQ is initiated by a client [[DNS resolver|resolver]] that wishes to track one or more names in the DNS.   The client resolver sends a registration message to a [[caching name server|caching server]], or to the [[Authoritative name server|authoritative server]] for the zone containing the name or names to be tracked.   The query includes a lease; the tracking persists for the duration of the lease.   If tracking is desired after the lease expires, the client resolver sends a new registration.  The registration message includes a list of one or more queries.   The server immediately returns the answers it has for these queries.  For the duration of the lease, whenever the information covered by any of the queries changes, the server sends a "gratuitous response" containing new answers.   Before the queries are answered and the lease recorded, the server and client perform a challenge/response exchange to validate the registration.   Gratuitous answers are acknowledged by the client, and retransmitted if not acknowledged.   After several tries, the server holding the registration will assume that the client resolver is no longer available, and will delete the registration.&lt;ref name="DNS-LLQ-1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1380">Current Vietnamese historical science considers that [[Vietnam]] has had a total of three declarations of independence:
#The poem ''[[Nam quốc sơn hà]]'' (''Mountains and rivers of Southern country'') was written in 1077 by [[Lý Thường Kiệt]] and recited next to the defense line of the Như Nguyệt river (Cầu river), originally with the reason to incentive the spirit of the soldiers.
#''[[Bình Ngô đại cáo]]'' (''Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the [[Ming Dynasty|Wu]]'') was written by [[Nguyễn Trãi]] to speak in the name of Bình Định vương [[Lê Lợi]] in the Đinh Mùi year (1427), announcing the pacification of the Ming army, regaining the national independence, establishing the Later [[Lê Dynasty]].
#The [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Proclamation of Independence]] (''Tuyên ngôn độc lập'') was written by [[Hồ Chí Minh]] and read at [[Ba Đình Square]], [[Hanoi]], on September 2, 1945, declared independence from [[Japan]] and [[France]], forming the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] (North Vietnam).

[[File:Danimarca XIII secolo, plinio historia naturalis.JPG|thumb|''Natural History'', written by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the first century, was the first book to be called an encyclopedia. It was highly regarded in the Middle Ages. This profusely illustrated manuscript was produced in the 13th century.]]
'''Encyclopedism''' is an outlook that aims to include a wide range of knowledge in a single work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smiraglia|first1=Richard|title=The Elements of Knowledge Organization|date=2014|publisher=[[Springer Nature|Springer]]|location=Cham (Switzerland)|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term covers both [[encyclopedia]]s themselves and related genres in which comprehensiveness is a notable feature. The word encyclopedia is a Latinization of the Greek ''enkýklios paideía'', which means all-around education.&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;"[https://global.britannica.com/topic/encyclopaedia encyclopedia]," ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia is "one of the few generalizing influences in a world of overspecialization. It serves to recall that knowledge has unity," according to [[Lewis Shore]], editor of ''Collier's Encyclopedia''. It should not be "a miscellany, but a concentration, a clarification, and a synthesis", according to British writer [[H.G. Wells]].&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

Besides comprehensiveness, encyclopedic writing is distinguished by its lack of a specific audience or practical application. The author explains facts concisely for the benefit of a reader who will then use the information in a way that the writer does not try to anticipate. Early examples of encyclopedic writing include discussions of agriculture and craft by Roman writers such as [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Varro]]&amp;nbsp;– discussions presumably not intended as practical advice to farmers or craftsmen.&lt;ref name=Formisano&gt;Formisano, Marco, "Late Latin Encyclopedism: toward a new paradigm for practical knowledge," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2013, pp. 201-202. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of classical learning was lost during the Dark Ages. This enhanced the status of encyclopedic works which survived, including those of [[Aristotle]] and Pliny. With the development of printing in the 15th century, the range of knowledge available to readers expanded greatly. Encyclopedic writing became both a practical necessity and a clearly distinguished genre. Renaissance encyclopedists were keenly aware of how much classical learning had been lost. They hoped to recover and record knowledge and were anxious to prevent further loss.&lt;ref name=blair&gt;Blair, Ann, "Revisiting Renaissance Encyclopedism," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2013, pp. 381-382. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their modern form, encyclopedias consist of alphabetized articles written by teams of specialists. This format was developed in the 18th century by expanding the technical dictionary to include non-technical topics. The ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1772), edited by [[Diderot]] and [[D'Alembert]], was a model for many later works. Like Renaissance encyclopedists, Diderot worried about the possible destruction of civilization and selected knowledge he hoped would survive.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iep.utm.edu/encyclop/ Encyclopedists]", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Johannes Aventinus.jpg|thumb|In 1517, Bavarian [[Johannes Aventinus]] wrote the first book that used the word "encyclopedia" in the title.]]
The word "encyclopedia" is a Latinization of the Greek ''enkýklios paideía.'' The Greek phrase refers to the education that a well-round student should receive. Latin writer [[Quintilian]] uses it to refer to the subjects a student of oratory should be familiar with before beginning an apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''The Orator's Education'', 1.10.1: ''ut efficiatur orbis ille doctrinae, quem Graeci'' ἐγκύκλιον παιδείαν ''vocant.''&lt;/ref&gt; It translates literally as "in (''en'') the circle (''kýklios'') of knowledge (''paideía'')." The earliest citation for "encyclopedia" given in ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' refers to the Greek curriculum and is dated 1531.&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopedia", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', From ''The Book of the Governor'' by Thomas Elyot (i. xiii): "The circle of doctrine is in one worde of greke '''Encyclopedia'''."&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the term to refer to a genre of literature was prompted by a line that Pliny used in the preface of ''Natural History'':&lt;ref name=Konig&gt;Jason König and Gregg Wolf, (2013) "Introduction," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 1. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "My object is to treat of all those things which the Greeks include in the Encyclopædia [''tē̂s enkyklíou paideías''], which, however, are either not generally known or are rendered dubious from our ingenious conceits."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'', preface 14: ''ante omnia attingenda quae graeci'' τῆς ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας ''vocant.'' For the English translation, see [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137 here]. For the Latin/Greek original, see [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-lat1:preface here].&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny writes the relevant phrase using Greek letters. Latin printers of [[incunabula]] lacked the typeface to render it. Some printers substituted ''encyclopædia'' or another Latin phrase. Others just left a blank space.&lt;ref&gt;A [http://www.cmog.org/library/historia-naturalis Venice incunabulum printed in 1469] has a blank space in the middle of second page where this phrase is supposed to be.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the misunderstanding that Pliny had called his work an encyclopedia.&lt;ref name="Konig" /&gt;

In the Renaissance, writers who wanted their work compared to that of Pliny used the word. In 1517, Bavarian [[Johannes Aventinus]] wrote ''Encyclopedia orbisqve doctrinarum,'' a Latin reference work.&lt;ref&gt;Aventinus, Johannes, ''Encyclopedia orbisqve doctrinarum : hoc est omniu[m] artiu[m]m, scientiaru[m], ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio scriptores earundem rerum&amp;nbsp;... ; ex Platone Aristotele'', Auguste : Miller, 1517. (WorldCat entry)&lt;/ref&gt; Ringelberg's ''Cyclopedia'' was published in 1541 and Paul Scalich's ''Encyclopedia'' in 1559.&lt;ref&gt;Ringelberg, Joachim Fortius, ''Lucubrationes, vel potius absolutissima kyklopaideia'', 1541.&lt;br&gt;Scalich, Paul, ''Pauli Scalichii Encyclopaediae, sen Orbis disciplinarum epistemon'' (''Paul Scalich's Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World of Disciplines),'' Basel, 1559.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these reference works were written in Latin.&lt;ref name=Markey&gt;Markey, Morris, "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1868/02/the-encyclopedists/305188/ The Encyclopedists]", ''The Atlantic'', Feb. 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[Encyclopédistes]] popularized the word in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

The ''Oxford English Dictionary'''s first citation of "enyclopedism" is dated 1833. The context is a book on Diderot.&lt;ref&gt;1833 Carlyle, ''Diderot'', Misc. V. 45 "This exaggerated laudation of Encyclopedism."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Busto di Aristotele conservato a Palazzo Altemps, Roma. Foto di Giovanni Dall'Orto.jpg|thumb|In the 4th century BC, [[Aristotle]] wrote on a broad range of topics and explained how knowledge can be classified.]]

===Aristotle===
The Greek writer and teacher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) had much to say on a broad range of subjects, including biology, anatomy, psychology, physics, meteorology, zoology, poetics, rhetoric, logic, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and political thought. He was among the first writers to describe how to classify material by subject, the first step in writing an encyclopedia. Aristotle wrote to help his students follow his teaching, so his corpus did not much resemble an encyclopedia during his lifetime. Long after his death, commentators filled in the gaps, reordered his works, and put his writing in a systematic form. Catalogs of his work were produced by Andronicus in the first century and by Ptolemy in the second century. As Aristotle's corpus was one of the few encyclopedic works to survive the Middle Ages, it became a widely used reference work in late medieval and Renaissance times.&lt;ref&gt;Jason König and Gregg Wolf, "Encyclopaedism in the Roman Empire," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 27–28. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alexandria===
Dorotheus (mid first century AD) and [[Pamphilus of Alexandria|Pamphilus]] (late first century AD) both wrote enormous lexicons. Neither work has survived, but their lengths suggest that they were considerably more than just dictionaries. Pamphilus's work was 95 books long and was a sequel to a lexicon of four books by Zopyrion. This passage from the ''[[Suda|Souda]]'' suggests that it was made up of alphabetized entries:&lt;ref name=Hatzimichali&gt;Hatzimichali, Myrto, "Encyclopedism in the Alexandrian Library," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 197–218. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Pamphilus, of Alexandria, a grammarian of the school of Aristarchus. He wrote ''A Meadow,'' which is a summary of miscellaneous contents. ''On rare words; i.e. vocabulary'' in 95 books (it contains entries from epsilon to omega, because Zopyrion had done letters alpha to delta.) ''On unexplained matters in Nicander'' and the so called ''Optica; Art of Criticism'' and a large number of other grammatical works.&lt;ref&gt;''Souda'' {{pi}} 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hatzimichali" /&gt;}}

[[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] (fifth century) credits [[Diogenianus]] as a source,&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, Jonathan, ''Mantissa'' (2015), p. 282. "Plainly, Diogenianus was an important source for Hesychius."&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn used Pamphilus.&lt;ref&gt;Francesca Schironi, ''From Alexandria to Babylon: Near Eastern Languages and Hellenistic Erudition in the Oxyrhynchus Glossary (P.Oxy. 1802 + 4812)'' (2009), p. 49. "From this scholium it become clear that Diogenianus did not excerpt directly from Pamphilus, but rather from Vestinus. So we have the chain Pamphilus-Vestinus-Diogenianus-Hesychius."&lt;/ref&gt; This is the only form in which any of Pamphilus's work may have survived.

===Rome===
A Roman who wanted to learn about a certain subject would a send a slave to a private library with orders to copy relevant passages from whatever books were available. As they were less likely to withdraw or buy a book, readers were little concerned with the scope of a given work. So the emergence of encyclopedic writing cannot be explained by practical need. Instead, it may have been inspired by [[Cato the Elder|Cato]]'s ideal of the ''[[vir bonus]]'', the informed citizen able to participate in the life of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Formisano, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three Roman works are commonly identified as encyclopedic: The collected works of [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (116–27 BC), [[Pliny the Elder]]'s (c. 77–79 AD) ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', and ''On the Arts'' by [[Cornelius Celsus]] (c. 25 BC&amp;nbsp;– c. 50 AD). These three were grouped together as a genre, not by the Romans themselves, but by later writers in search of antique precedent.&lt;ref name=Roman&gt;Jason König and Gregg Wolf, "Encyclopaedism in the Roman Empire," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 23–63. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cicero's time, the study of literature was still controversial. In ''Pro Archia'', Cicero explains that he studied literature to improve his rhetorical skills and because it provides a source of elevating moral examples. Varro's emphasis on the city's history and culture suggests patriotic motives. Pliny emphasized utilitarian motives and public service. He criticized [[Livy]] for writing history simply for his own pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Beagon, Mary, "''Labores pro bono publico'' the burdensome mission of Pliny's ''Natural History''," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 92. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Varro====
Varro's ''Antiquities'' consisted of 41 books on Roman history. His ''Disciplines'' was nine books on liberal arts. Varro also wrote 25 books on Latin and 15 on law. Only fragments of Varro's work survive. According to Cicero, Varro's comprehensive work allowed the Romans to feel at home in their own city.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica Posteriora'' 1.9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roman" /&gt;

====Cornelius Celsus====
[[File:Aulus Cornelius Celsus.jpg|thumb|[[Cornelius Celsus]] wrote prolifically on various topics in first century Rome. He knew "all things," according to a tribute by Quintilian. Only his work on medicine survives.]]
Celsus wrote prolifically on many subjects. "Cornelius Celsus, a man of modest intellect, could write not only about all these arts but also left behind accounts of military science, agriculture, and medicine: indeed, he deserves, on the basis on this design alone, to be thought to have known all things," according to Quintilian.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''The Orator's Education'', 12.11.23-4&lt;/ref&gt; Only the medical section of his massive ''On the Arts'' has survived. This is eight books long. Celsus followed the structure of the medical writers that had gone before him. He summarized their views in a workmanlike manner. He seldom presented insights of his own. He struggled to manage the overwhelming quantity of relevant source material.&lt;ref&gt;Jason König and Gregg Wolf, "Encyclopaedism in the Roman Empire, " ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 39-40. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His medical books were rediscovered in 1426-1427 at libraries in the Vatican and in Florence and published in 1478. He is our main source concerning Roman medical practices.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=2111 The Oldest Western Medical Document after the Hippocratic Writings, and How it Survived the Middle Ages]", ''Jeremy Norman's History of Information"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pliny the Elder====
If Varro made the Romans feel at home their own city, Pliny tried to do the same for the natural world and for the Empire. Pliny's approach was very different than that of Celsus. He was a man ahead of his time. Not content to build on what went before, he reorganized the world of knowledge to fit his encyclopedic vision. In a Latin preface, the writer customarily listed the models he hoped to surpass. Pliny found no model in previous writing. Instead, he emphasized that his work was ''novicium'' (new), a word suitable for describing a major discovery. Although Pliny was widely read, no later Roman writer followed his structure or claimed him as a model. Niccolò Leoniceno published an essay in 1492 listing Pliny's many scientific errors.&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;"Pliny the Elder", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', Pliny writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;in Thirty-six Books I have comprised 20,000 Things that are worthy of Consideration, and these I have collected out of about 2000 Volumes that I have diligently read (and of which there are few that Men otherwise learned have ventured to meddle with, for the deep Matter therein contained), and those written by one hundred several excellent Authors; besides a Multitude of other Matters, which either were unknown to our former Writers, or Experience has lately ascertained.&lt;ref name="pliny"&gt;Pliny. (1847). ''[https://archive.org/details/plinysnaturalhis00plinrich Pliny's Natural History. In thirty-seven books]'' (P. Holland, Trans.). London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With an entire book dedicated to listing sources, ''Natural History'' is 37 books long. (It's 10 volumes in the modern translation.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, the Elder.; H Rackham, ''Natural History'', Cambridge, Mass.: [[Harvard University Press]], 1938-1963.&lt;/ref&gt;) Eschewing established disciplines and categories, Pliny begins with a general description of the world. Book 2 covers astronomy, meteorology, and the elements. Books 3–6 cover geography. Humanity is covered in Book 7, animals in Books 8–11, trees in 12–17, agriculture in 18–19, medicine in 20–32, metals in 33–34, and craft and art in 35–37.

Following Aristotle, Pliny counts four elements: fire, earth, air and water.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:10&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven planets: Saturn, Jupiter, Mars ("of a fiery and burning nature"), the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and the Moon ("the last of the stars").&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:28-51&lt;/ref&gt; The earth is a "perfect globe," suspended in the middle of space, that rotates with incredible swiftness once every 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:5-6, 8, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; As a good Stoic, Pliny dismisses astrology: "it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all things, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs."&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'' II:38.&lt;/ref&gt; He considers the possibility of other worlds ("there will be so many suns and so many moons, and that each of them will have immense trains of other heavenly bodies") only to dismiss such speculation as "madness." The idea of space travel is "perfect madness."&lt;ref&gt;''Natural History'', II:6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pliny had opinions on a wide variety of subjects often interjected them. He tells us which uses of plants, animals, and stone are proper, and which ones are improper. Was the Roman Empire benefiting or corrupting the classical world? Pliny returns to this theme repeatedly. He analogizes Rome's civilizing mission to the way poisonous plants of all nation were tamed into medicines.&lt;ref&gt;Molly Ayn Jones-Lewis, "[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/491348/pdf Poison: Nature's Argument for the Roman Empire in Pliny the Elder's Naturalis Historia]", ''Classical World'', Volume 106, Number 1, Fall 2012, pp. 51–74, 10.1353/clw.2013.0013&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny also wants us to know that he is a heroic explorer, a genius responsible for a highly original and most remarkable work. The extensive reading and note taking of his slave secretaries is rarely mentioned.

At the very end of the work, Pliny writes, "Hail Nature, parent of all things, and in recognition of the fact that I alone have praised you in all your manifestations, look favorably upon me."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, 37.205.&lt;/ref&gt; Here Pliny points to comprehensiveness as his project's outstanding asset. Nature awarded Pliny a heroic death that gave him "a kind of eternal life," according to his nephew. The great encyclopedist was commander of the Naples fleet and died trying to assist the local inhabitants during the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger, "[http://www.volcanolive.com/pliny.html Mt Vesuvius Eruption 79 AD]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Middle Ages===
[[File:BL_Royal_Vincent_of_Beauvaiscrop.jpg|thumb|[[Vincent of Beauvais]] (c. 1190&amp;nbsp;– 1264?) was one of the best-known encyclopedists of the medieval period. This illustration is from a 15th-century French translation of his work.]]
While classical and modern encyclopedic writers sought to distribute knowledge, those of the Middle Ages were more interested in establishing orthodoxy. They produced works to be used as educational texts in schools and universities. Students could consider the knowledge within them as safely orthodox and thus be kept from heresy. Limiting knowledge was an important part of their function.&lt;ref name=Keen&gt;Keen, Elizabeth, "Shifting Horizons: The Medieval Compilation of Knowledge as Mirror of a Changing World," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2013, p. 278. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[Stoicism|Stoic]], Pliny began with astronomy and ended with the fine arts. [[Cassiodorus]] attempted to write a Christian equivalent to Pliny's work. His ''Institutiones'' (560) begins with discussions of scripture and the church. Other subjects are treated briefly toward the end of the work. With onset of the Dark Ages, access to Greek learning and literacy in Greek declined. The works of [[Boethius]] (c. 480–524) filled the gap by compiling Greek handbooks and summarizing their content in Latin. These works served as general purpose references in the early Middle Ages.

''The Etymologies'' (c. 600–625) by [[Isidore of Seville]] consisted of extracts from earlier writers. Three of the Isidore's twenty books represent material from Pliny. Isidore was the most widely read and fundamental text in terms of medieval encyclopedic writing.&lt;ref&gt;Keen, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

These early medieval writers organized their material in the form of a ''trivium'' (grammar, logic, rhetoric) followed by a ''quadrivium'' (geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music). This division of seven liberal arts was a feature of monastic education as well as the medieval universities, which developed beginning in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

The main section of the ''Code of Justinian'', called the Pandects, was a legal reference of 50 books that was compiled by a commission of 16 lawyers led by [[Tribonian]] in 530 to 533. The Latin title ''Pandectēs'' ("all-incompassing") translates directly as "encyclopedia." The work summarized judicial opinions on various issues, and is less grandly referred to as "Digesta" (legal digests). When Charlemagne conquered Italy in 800, he wished to revive Roman Law. But no copy of the Code could be found. A manuscript was discovered centuries later, (in 1136 in Amalfi, according to legend.)

From the fourth to the ninth centuries, Byzantium experienced a series of religious debates. As part of these debates, excerpts were compiled and organized thematically to support the theological views of the compiler. Once orthodoxy was established, the energy of the compilation tradition transferred to other subjects. The tenth century, or Macedonian dynasty, saw a flowering of encyclopedic writing. Th ''Suda'' is believed to have been compiled at this time. This is the earliest work that a modern reader would recognize as an encyclopedia. It contains 30,000 alphabetized entries. The ''Suda'' is not mentioned until the 12th century, and it might have been put together in stages.&lt;ref&gt;Magdalino, Paul, "Byzantine encyclopaedism of the ninth and tenth centuries," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 221. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most massive encyclopedia of the Middle Ages was ''[[Speculum Maius]]'' (''The Great Mirror'') by [[Vincent of Beauvais]]. It was 80 books long and was completed in 1244. With a total of 4.5 million words, the work is presumably the product of an anonymous team.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; (By comparison, the current edition of ''Britanica'' has 44 million words.&lt;ref&gt;""[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html 44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet]," ''New York Times'', February 8, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;) It was divided into three sections. "Naturale" covered God and the natural world; "Doctrinale" covered language, ethics, crafts, medicine; and "Historiale" covered world history. Vincent had great respect for classical writers such Aristotle, Cicero, and Hippocrates. The encyclopedia shows a tendency toward "exhaustiveness," or systemic plagiarism, typical of the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/haywardp/hist424/seminars/Beauvais.htm Vincent of Beauvais, ''Speculum historiale'']," ''Medieval Primary Sources''&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent was used as a source by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]. The full version of ''Speculum'' proved to be too long to circulate in the era of manuscripts and manual copying. However, an abridged version by Bartholomeaus Anglicus did enjoy a wide readership.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, pp. 388-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab counterpart to these works was ''Kitab al-Fehrest'' by Ibn al-Nadim.

===China===
The nearest Chinese equivalent to an encyclopedia is the ''leishu''. These consist of extensive quotations arranged by category. The earliest known Chinese encyclopedia is ''Huang Lan'' (''Emperor's mirror''), produced around 220 under the Wei dynasty. No copy has survived.&lt;ref&gt;Zurndorfer, Harriet T., "The passion to collect, select, and protect: fifteen hundred years of the Chinese encyclopedia," ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, p. 505. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known ''leishu'' are those of Li Fang (925–996), who wrote three such works during the [[Song dynasty]]. These three were later combined with a fourth work, ''Cefu Yuangui'', to create ''[[Four Great Books of Song]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Zurndorfer, pp. 510-511.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
With the advent of printing and a dramatic reduction in paper costs, the volume of encyclopedic writing exploded in the Renaissance. This was an age of "info-lust" and enormous compilations. Many compilers cited the fear of a traumatic loss of knowledge to justify their efforts. They were keenly aware of how much classical learning had been lost in the Dark Ages.&lt;ref name="blair" /&gt; Pliny was their model. His axiom that, "there is no book so bad that some good cannot be got from it" was a favorite. Conrad Gesner listed over 10,000 books in ''Bibliotheca universalis'' (1545). By including both Christian and barbarian works, Gesner rejected the medieval quest for orthodoxy. Ironically, Jesuit Antonio Possevino used ''Bibliotheca universalis'' as a basis to create a list of forbidden books.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
The invention of printing helped spread new ideas, but also revived old misconceptions. Printers of incunabulia were eager to publish books, both ancient and modern. The best-known encyclopedia of Elizabethan England was ''Batman upon Bartholomew'', published in 1582. This book is based on a work compiled by Bartholomaeus Anglicus in the 13th century. It was translated by John of Trevisa in 1398, revised by Thomas Berthelet in 1535, and revised again by Stephen Bateman. In Shakespeare's day, it represented a worldview already four centuries old, only modestly updated. Yet several ideas inspired by Bateman can be found in Shakespeare. The idea that the rays of the moon cause madness can be found ''Measure for Measure''&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''Measure for Measure'', 3.1.23-5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Othello'',&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''Othello'', 5.2.107-9.&lt;/ref&gt; hence the word "lunacy." The discussion of the geometric properties of the soul in ''King Lear'' is likely to reflect the influence of Bateman as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, ''King Lear'' 1.1.73&lt;/ref&gt; An encyclopedia that Shakespeare consulted more obviously than Bateman is ''French Academy'' by Pierre de la Primaudaye. Primaudaye was much taken with analogies, some of which have found their way into Shakespeare: the unweeded garden, death as an unknown country, and the world as a stage. (Various other sources have also been suggested for the last analogy.) Both Bateman and Primaudaye were Protestant.&lt;ref name=rhodes&gt;Rhodes, Neil, "Shakespeare's Encyclopedias", ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mfPXAAAAQBAJ&amp;dq= Encyclopaedism from Antiquity to the Renaissance]'', Cambridge University Press, 2013, pp. 414–443. {{ISBN|9781107038233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]] wrote a plan for an encyclopedia in ''Instauratio magna'' (1620). He drew up a checklist of the major areas of knowledge a complete encyclopedia needed to contain. Bacon's plan influenced Diderot and thus indirectly later encyclopedias, which generally follow Diderot's scheme.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

===The Enlightenment===
[[File:Encyclopedie cover page.jpg|thumb|''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–1777), edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was greatly admired and a model for many subsequent works.]]
While ancient and medieval encylopedism emphasized the classics, liberal arts, informed citizenship, or law, the modern encyclopedia springs from a separate tradition. The advance of technology meant that there was much unfamiliar terminology to explain. John Harris's ''Lexicon Technicum'' (1704) proclaims itself, "An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves." This was the first alphabetical encyclopedia written in English. Harris's work inspired Ephraim Chambers's ''Cyclopedia'' (1728). Chambers's two-volume work is considered the first modern encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ephraim Chambers: British author|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ephraim-Chambers|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Encyclopédie'' (1751–1777) was a massively expanded version of Chambers's idea. This 32-volume work, edited by Diderot and D'Alembert, was the pride of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] France.&lt;ref name="Markey" /&gt; It consisted of 21 volumes of text and 11 volumes of illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/intro.html About this project]", ''The Encyclopedia of Diderot and D'Alembert''&lt;/ref&gt; There were 74,000 articles written by more than 130 contributors. It presented a [[secularism|secular]] worldview, drawing the ire of several Church officials. It sought to empower its readers with knowledge and played a role in fomenting the dissent that led to the [[French Revolution]]. Diderot explained the project this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is a work that cannot be completed except by a society of men of letters and skilled workmen, each working separately on his own part, but all bound together solely by their zeal for the best interests of the human race and a feeling of mutual good will.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/ The Encyclopedia of Diderot and D'Alembert]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This realization that no one person, not even a genius like Pliny assisted by slave secretaries, could produce a work of the comprehensiveness required, is the mark of the modern era of encyclopedism.

Diderot's project was a great success and inspired several similar projects, including Britain's ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' (first edition, 1768) as well as Germany's ''Brockhaus Enzyklopädie'' (beginning 1808). Enlightenment encyclopedias also inspired authors and editors to undertake or critique "encyclopedic" knowledge projects in other genres and formats: the 65-volume [[Universal History (Sale et al)]] (1747-1768), for example, far exceeded its predecessors in terms of scope, and ''The General Magazine of Arts and Sciences'' (1755-1765) published by [[Benjamin Martin (lexicographer)]] sought to bring encyclopedism to the monthly periodical. A loyal subscriber, he wrote, would “be allowed to make a great Proficiency, if he can make himself Master of the useful Arts and Sciences in the Compass of Ten Years.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The General Magazine of Arts and Sciences|last=Martin|first=Benjamin|publisher=|year=1755|isbn=|location=London|pages=1:v-vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman]]'' (1759-1767), the title character satirically refers to his fictional autobiography as a “cyclopædia of arts and sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|last=Sterne|first=Laurence|publisher=Penguin|year=2003|isbn=0141439777|location=New York|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such "experiments in encyclopedism" demonstrate the widespread literary and cultural influence of the form in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137411532|title=Literature and Encyclopedism in Enlightenment Britain: The Pursuit of Complete Knowledge|last=Rudy|first=Seth|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|year=2014|isbn=134948928X|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; England|pages=|language=en|chapter=Mid-Century Experiments in Encyclopedism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 19th and 20th centuries===
Once solely for society's elites, in the 19th and 20th centuries encyclopedias were increasingly written, marketed to, and purchased by middle and working class households. Different styles of encyclopedism emerged which would target particular age groups, presenting the works as educational tools—even made available through payment plans advertised on TV.

One of the earliest individuals to advocate for a technologically enhanced encyclopedia indexing all the world's information was [[H. G. Wells]]. Inspired by the possibilities of [[microfilm]], he put forward his idea of a global encyclopedia in the 1930s through a series of international talks and his essay ''[[World Brain]]''.

It would be another several decades before the earliest electronic encyclopedias were published in the 1980s and 1990s. The production of electronic encyclopedias began as conversions of printed work, but soon added [[multimedia]] elements, requiring new methods of content gathering and presentation. Early applications of [[hypertext]] similarly had a great benefit to readers but did not require significant changes in writing. The launching of Wikipedia in the 2000s and its subsequent rise in popularity and influence, however, radically altered popular conception of the ways in which an encyclopedia is produced (collaboratively, openly) and consumed (ubiquitously).

The '''Gautreaux Project''' is a US housing-[[desegregation]] project initiated by [[court order]].  It is notable both for being one of the only social programs based in a randomized [[experiment]], and the only anti-[[poverty]] housing program endorsed by the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]], [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]], and [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administrations.

==Chronology==
The [[ACLU]]-initiated 1966 [[class action]] [[lawsuit]] ''[[Dorothy Gautreaux]] v. [[Chicago Housing Authority]]'' (CHA) alleged that the [[Chicago Housing Authority|CHA]] engaged in [[racism|racial discrimination]] in public housing policy, as prohibited by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}  The lawsuit alleged that the CHA built [[public housing]] solely in areas with high concentrations of poor [[Minority group|minorities]], in violation of the federal [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) guidelines and the Civil Rights Act.  The goal of the lawsuit was to begin building [[public housing]] in predominantly white neighborhoods.
  
HUD entered as a party to the lawsuit, and the case went to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1976 as ''[[Hills v. Gautreaux]]'' (425 U.S. 284).

In a [[consent decree]], the court ordered the CHA to provide scattered-site housing for [[public housing]] residents currently residing in isolated public housing projects in concentrated areas of [[poverty]].
 
The CHA distributed [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] housing vouchers to 7500 [[African American]] families on [[welfare]] in either [[suburban]] or [[Urban area|urban]] locations. The Chicago Housing Authority designated a day on which Section 8 vouchers are distributed to the first several hundred callers. Applicants were screened by two standards—basic apartment maintenance and lack of a serious [[criminal record]]—and two-thirds of the applicants were accepted. Successful applicants were offered placement in private market apartment units in either city or suburban locations chosen at random by the CHA, and most accepted the placement. The program was intentionally low-profile: only a few participants are moved into each suburb in order to prevent [[white flight]], and because the residents moved into private units, they had no external markers of being on welfare.

==Results==
The [[suburban]] and [[Urban area|urban]] participants started out identical: all were selected from the same pool of callers, and were randomly placed into private apartments in either suburban or urban locations. After several years, the suburban and urban participants had very different outcomes. The urban participants were likely to remain on the [[welfare]] rolls, but their suburban counterparts were very likely to find employment and leave welfare. The urban participants' children were likely to drop out of [[high school]], but their suburban counterparts are likely to graduate from high school and even college.  The program participants' children were initially below the academic level of their classmates, but because only a few families were moved to each suburbs, the suburban teachers could take time with each new child and tutor each child individually until the children were at the same level as their classmates.

The [[sociologist]] [[James Rosenbaum]] who studied the Gautreaux project testified before the [[US Congress]] on the success of the program, and it has become a model for similar programs in 33 metropolitan areas and inspired the national [[Moving to Opportunity]] (MTO) program.

Some housing departments misinterpreted the results of the Gautreaux project, and used it as justification for emptying and demolishing public housing, as a result of which thousands of public housing residents at a time moved to the same suburbs and overwhelmed the suburbs' resources with urban problems.  Gautreaux intentionally moved only a few public housing residents to each suburb.

'''General Material Designation''' (GMD) is used in Library and other catalogues to describe the material type of the item.The list was created as part of the [[Anglo-American Cataloging Rules]] (AACR2), and has been included  the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]], As part of the ongoing process to standardize international and local cataloging standards. While being superseded by the [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA) rules, the GMD is still in use in many institutions. 
General Material Designation created a list of standardized terms, describing the material of the item. Examples such as braille, microfilm, motion picture are used to eliminate different cataloging practices previously used by Libraries. The full list appears in AACR2, with explanations and examples.
The GMD can be applied at different points in the catalog, according to [[Machine Readable Cataloging|MARC]]standards. Points of access include title, alternative titles, author and subject.
In recent years, a number of issues regarding GMD have arisen, including lack of terms to define newer material types, lack of consistency in application by different library systems, incompatibility with needs of special libraries and museums, and the difficulty of relating to digital forms. In 2013 GMD was superseded by RDA, which greatly enlarged the list and divided the list into three, describing content, media and carrier types.

 &lt;!-- 211 words / 1393 characters (with spaces, 1183 without), if you were wondering. And it lacks (IMO) info that would make it understandable by a non-expert --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6001">[[Giant (mythology)|Giants]] or '''cewri''' feature prominently in [[Welsh mythology|Welsh]] folklore and mythology. Among the most notable are [[Bran the Blessed|Bendigeidfran fab Llyr]], a mythological king of Britain during the [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Second Branch of the Mabinogi]], [[Idris (giant)|Idris Gawr]] of [[Cader Idris]], and [[Ysbaddaden|Ysbaddaden Bencawr]], the chief antagonist of the early [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] tale ''[[Culhwch and Olwen|How Culhwch won Olwen]]''. Both [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Gawain|Gwalchmai fab Gwyar]] feature prominently as giant-slayers in Welsh tradition.&lt;ref name="maryjones.us"&gt;[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/giants_wales.html The Giants of Wales and their dwellings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tales==

===Giants in the Mabinogion===

In the Mabinogi of [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|Branwen ferch Llyr]], Britain is ruled by the giant [[Bran the Blessed]], who has never been able to fit inside any dwelling. In ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', giants feature as antagonists throughout. [[Ysbaddaden]], chief of giants, is the father of [[Olwen]], a beautiful maiden sought by [[Culhwch|Culhwch fab Cilydd]], a cousin of [[King Arthur|King Arthur's]]. He is slain at the tale's close by his nephew Goreu fab Custennin,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Sioned. ''The Mabinogion''.&lt;/ref&gt; while Wrnach, another giant, is killed by [[Sir Kay|Cei]].

===Legend of Rhitta Gawr===&lt;!-- [[Rhitta Gawr]] redirects here --&gt;
A well-known tale concerns Rhitta (or Rhudda) Gawr, a giant who held court in [[Snowdonia]]. He marched against warring kings Nyniaw and Peibaw, overwhelmed their armies and took their beards as trophies of his victory and fashioned them into a cap for himself. The twenty-six kings of Britain assembled their armies to destroy Rhitta but were vanquished by the giant, who cut off the kings' beards and fashioned a great cape out of them to protect him from the cold. Sometime later, as [[King Arthur|Arthur]] "washed his hands after slaying the red-eyed giant of Cernyw", he received a message from Rhitta, demanding his beard to patch his cloak. Arthur refused, and Rhitta marched south with his armies to claim it from him. In the resulting confrontation, Rhitta is forced to shear his own beard, and retreats "much humbled in stature but much wiser in knowledge". A variant tale claims that after receiving the demands, Arthur marched furiously up to Snowdonia and fought against the giant in a duel, in which he "lifted up his sword and struck Rhitta on the crown of the head a blow so fiercely-wounding, severely-venomous and sternly-smiting that it cut through all his head armour and his skin and his flesh and clove him in twain.",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/wfb/wfb39.htm] ''The Mantle of Kings' Beards''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story, Arthur commands that a cairn be built over his body which forms Gwyddfa Rhudda (Rhita's Cairn). Over the intervening centuries the name of Rhudda was forgotten and Gwyddfa Rhudda became known as ''[[Yr Wyddfa]]''.

===The Capture of Maelor Gawr===
[[Maylor Gawr|Maelor Gawr]], the giant of Castell Maelor (now the village of [[Penparcau]]), was captured in Cyfeilog, about twelve miles from his own castle and was sentenced to death. His enemies allowed him his final request to blow on his horn three times before his death. The first time he blew, his hair and beard fell out, and on the second blast of his horn, so great was the strength and force of the sounding that all his finger and toe-nails fell off completely. On the third blast of his horn the intensity of the force of the sound caused the horn to be broken into small pieces.

Maelor's son, Cornippin, who was hunting with his horse and his hound, heard the sound of his father's hand and lamented over his suffering. He made to rescue his father and in riding with such haste and swiftness, he tore the head of his hound off its body. He spurred his horse onwards, leaped in one great bound over the Ystwyth river and attacked his father's captors. In the ensuing battle, Cornippin was slain.&lt;ref name="maryjones.us"/&gt;

===Cribwr Gawr===

Cribwr the Giant lived in Castell Cefn Cribwr in [[Morgannwg]]. His three sisters were all killed by Arthur through "treachery". Arthur succeeded in slaying the giantesses by nicknaming himself as "Hot Pottage" to the first sister, and "Warm Porridge" to the second sister and as "a morsel of bread" to the third, and when the first sister called for help against Hot Pottage Cribwr answered: Wench, let him cool; and in the same manner he answered the second sister, when she sought assistance against Warm Porridge. And the third sister called out that the Morsel of Bread was choking her; and to this he answered, Wench, take a smaller piece. And when Cribwr reproached Arthur for killing his sisters Arthur replied:

''Cribwr take thy combs''

''And cease with currish anger''

''If I get a real chance—surely''

''What they have had, thou shalt have too.''

==Other notable giants==

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' claims that Benlli Gawr was an early king of [[Kingdom of Powys|Powys]], who was burned to death after acting aggressively towards [[Germanus of Auxerre]].

Canthrig Bwt, a giantess and witch notorious in the folklore of [[Gwynedd]], lived under a great stone in Nant Peris and killed and [[cannibalism|ate]] a number of the community's children.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, John. ''Llên Gwerin Sir Gaernarfon''&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogfran the Giant is recorded in the [[Welsh Triads]] as the father of [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]], Arthur's third wife. A tale tells of the imprisonment of a number of his sons by the giants of Bron Wrgan, leading to Arthur's attack on the abode to free his brothers-in-law.&lt;ref name="maryjones.us"/&gt;

==Other Associations==

The traditional [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for [[Stonehenge]] is '''Côr y Cewri''' or "Council of the Giants".

'''Invercargill City Council v Hamlin''' [1994] 3 NZLR 513, [1996] 1 NZLR 513 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding council liability for negligent inspection, as well the issue in tort when the start period for the statute of limitations for a latent defect begins.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts | edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hamlin built a house in 1972 in Invercargill. 17 years later in 1989, Hamlin noticed cracks in his houses foundations. A subsequent builders report revealed the council had signed off building consent on the house when it had substandard foundations.

Hamlin sought compensation from the council, who refused to pay, claiming that a council does not owe a duty of care for building inspections, and even if it was, the council was not liable here, as the event happened 17 years, this claim was barred by the 6 year time limit under the [[Statute of limitations|Statute of Limitations]].

==Held==
The High Court found the council liable, and awarded damages of $53,550. The council subsequently unsuccessfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, as well as the [[Privy council|Privy Council]].

'''Footnote:''' Section 393 (2) of The Building Act 2004 now limits such a claim to 10 years from the date of the act or omission giving rise to the claim.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5830">A number of '''Irish annals''', of which the earliest was the [[Chronicle of Ireland]], were compiled up to and shortly after the end of the 17th century.

[[Annals]] were originally a means by which monks  determined the yearly [[chronology]] of [[feast days]]. Over time, the [[obituary|obituaries]] of priests, abbots and bishops were added, along with that of notable political events.

Non-Irish models include [[Bede]]'s ''[[Chronica maiora]]'', [[Marcellinus Comes]]'s ''Chronicle of Marcellinus'' and the ''[[Liber pontificalis]]''.&lt;ref name=CC69&gt;Ó Corráin, "annals, Irish", p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
The origins of annalistic compilation can be traced to the occasional recording of notes and events in blank spaces between the ''[[latercus]]'', i.e. the 84-year [[Easter table]] adopted from Gaulish writer [[Sulpicius Severus]] (d. ''c''. 423).&lt;ref name=CC69 /&gt;

==Extant==

Manuscript copies of extant annals include the following:

* ''[[Annals of Boyle]]''
* ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]''
* ''[[Annals of Connacht]]''
* ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''
* ''[[Annals of Inisfallen]]''
* ''[[Annals of Lough Cé]]''
* ''Annales de Monte Fernandi'', a.k.a. ''Annals of [[Multyfarnham]]''
* ''Annals of [[Roscrea]]''
* ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]''
* ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]''
* ''[[Annals of Ulster]]''
* ''The Annals of Ireland by Friar [[John Clyn]]''
* ''Annals of [[Dudley Loftus]]''
* ''The Short Annals of Donegal''
* ''[[Leabhar Oiris]]''
* ''[[Annals of Nenagh]]''
* ''[[Mac Carthaigh's Book]]''
* ''[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]]'' (large parts)
* ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' (parts)
* ''[[Dublin Annals of Inisfallen]]''
* ''The Annals of Ireland by Thady Dowling''
* ''[[Short Annals of Tirconaill]]''
* ''[[Short Annals of Leinster]]''
* ''Annales Hibernie ab anno Christi 1162 usque ad annum 1370'', a.k.a. ''Pembridge's Annals''
* ''Annales Hiberniae'', a.k.a. ''Grace's Annals''
* ''[[Memoranda Gadelica]]''
* ''[[Annla Gearra as Proibhinse Ard Macha]]''
* ''[[A Fragment of Irish Annals]]''

==Other sources==

Others which contain annalistic material include:

* ''Leabhar Bhaile an Mhóta''
* ''Lebor Glinne Dá Loch''
* ''Lebor Leacáin''
* ''Leabhar Uí Dhubhagáin''
* ''[[Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil]]''
* ''[[Leabhar na nGenealach]]''

Many of these annals have been translated and published by the School of Celtic Studies, [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]], or the [[Irish Texts Society]]. In addition, the text of many are available on the internet at the [[Corpus of Electronic Texts]] (CELT Project) hosted by the History Department of University College Cork, National University of Ireland. (See External Links below)

The famous epic political tract ''[[Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib]]'' also contains a great deal of annalistic material from the Viking Age in Ireland which is to be found in no other surviving sources. Much of this was taken from the same sources ancestral to the [[Annals of Inisfallen]], which have come down to us both abbreviated and [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunose]].

==Lost annals==

Annals known to have existed but which have been lost include:

* ''Annals of the Island of Saints''
* ''Annals of Maolconary''
* ''[[Book of Cuanu]]''
* ''Book of Dub-da-leithe''
* ''Book of the Monks''
* ''Leabhar Airis Cloinne Fir Bhisigh''
* ''Leabhar Airisen''
* ''Leabhar Airisen Ghiolla Iosa Mhec Fhirbhisigh''
* ''Synchronisms of Flann Mainstreach''
* ''[[Chronicle of Ireland|The Chronicle of Ireland]]''

'''Joseph Whitaker''' (4 May 1820 – 15 May 1895) was a publisher who founded ''Whitaker's Almanack''.

==Early life==
Joseph Whitaker was born in London, and apprenticed to a bookseller at the age of fourteen.

==Career==
After years of experience at various bookselling firms, he undertook his own business as a publisher of theological works. In January 1858 he launched ''[[The Bookseller]]'' and in 1869 published the first issue of ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', a reference annual, which met with immediate (and lasting) success.

In 1874 he published the first edition of the ''Reference Catalogue of Current Literature'', of which several editions have since appeared. 

He was the father of fifteen children; the eldest, [[Joseph Vernon Whitaker]] was editor of the [[American Literary Gazette]], and later returned to England to become editor of the ''Bookseller'' and the ''Reference Catalogue''. [[Cuthbert Whitaker]], the twelfth child, succeeded his father as editor of the ''Almanack''.

==Death==
Whitaker died at [[68 Silver Street]], [[Enfield Town|Enfield]], on 15 May 1895, where he had lived since 1862. He was buried at [[West Norwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Valerie. (Ed.)

The [[official language|official]] and de facto [[national language]] of [[Bangladesh]] is [[Bengali language|Modern Standard Bengali]] (Literary Bengali). It serves as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the nation, with 98% of Bangladeshis fluent in Bengali (including dialects) as their [[first language]]. English, having no official status, is prevalent across government, law, business, media and education, and can be regarded as the de facto co-official language of Bangladesh (see [[Bangladeshi English]]).&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;Ethnologue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/53272796/Sucess-of-English-language-in-Bangladesh-rec|title=Sucess of English language in Bangladesh rec - Bangladesh - Dhaka|website=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hindustani language|Hindi]] is understood by some as a [[foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/news/169301/Hindi-has-bright-future-in-Bangladesh-Shringla|title=Hindi has bright future in Bangladesh: Shringla|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Indigenous peoples in Bangladesh|indigenous people]] of northern and southeastern Bangladesh speak a variety of native languages.

== Indo–Aryan languages ==
The lowlands of Bangladesh form the eastern half of the [[Ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] region of [[Bengal]], and the [[Bengali language]] is spoken by the majority of the country's inhabitants. There are also some [[Eastern Indo-Aryan languages|Eastern Indic]] language varieties, which are variously classified either as dialects of Bengali or separate but closely related languages. They can be thought of forming a [[dialect continuum]].
* Bengali branch:
** [[Bengali language|Bengali proper]]: spoken all over the country.
** [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bishnupriya Manipuri:]] An [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo–Aryan]] language by the Bishnupriya Manipuri people who live in Bangladesh. Bishnupriya Manipuri is distinct from the Bengali languages and contains many features and elements of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto–Burman]] languages.
** [[Chakma language|Chakma]]: Spoken in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts|Chittagong Hill Tract Region]]. Unrelated to the [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] commonly found in the region.
** [[Chittagonian language|Chittagonian]]: Spoken in the South–East region of [[Chittagong Hill Tracts|Chittagong]], it is often considered to be a dialect of Bengali, but both languages are largely mutually unintelligible.
** [[Hajong language|Hajong]]: Originally a Tibeto-Burman language that has shifted over time to an Indic language.
** [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]]: Spoken in [[Arakan State]], [[Burma]], and by refugees from that region, currently living in Bangladesh's Chittagong Division. It is also often called Arkani by native speakers.
** [[Sylheti language|Sylheti]]: Spoken by [[Sylhetis]] in the North–East region of [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]].
** [[Tangchangya language|Tangchangya]]: Tanchangya is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language spoken by the [[Tanchangya people]] of Bangladesh. It is closely related to [[Chakma language|Chakma]].
* [[Sadri language|Oraon Sadri]]: Also a major language of [[Jharkhand|Jharkhand State]], India.
* [[Bihari language|Bihari]]: Spoken primarily by the refugees from [[Bihar|Bihar State]], India.

==Non-Indo-Aryan languages==
The indigenous languages of the region are members of the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] families. Most of these languages are spoken in mountainous areas.

===Austroasiatic languages===
While the more widely spoken and better-known [[Austroasiatic languages]] are spoken in Southeast Asia (e.g. [[Khmer language|Khmer]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]), smaller languages of that family are spoken by indigenous communities of northern and eastern Bangladesh.
* [[Khasi language|Khasi]]: also a major language of [[Meghalaya]] State, India
* [[Koda language|Koda]]
* [[Mundari language|Mundari]]
* [[Pnar language|Pnar]]
* [[Santali language|Santali]]
* [[War language|War-Jaintia]]

===Dravidian languages===
Two [[Dravidian languages]] are spoken by indigenous communities of western Bangladesh.
* [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]]
* [[Sauria Paharia language|Sauria Paharia]]

===Tibeto-Burman languages===
The mountainous areas along the northern and eastern edges of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] are inhabited primarily by speakers of [[Tibeto-Burman languages]]. Indigenous Tibeto-Burman-speaking communities are found through the northern, eastern, and especially the southeastern parts of Bangladesh.
* [[A'Tong language|A'Tong]]
* [[Chak language|Chak]]
* [[Chin languages]]:
** [[Asho language|Asho]]
** [[Bawm language|Bawm]]
** [[Falam language|Falam]]

* [[Rakhine language|Rakhine]]/[[Marma Language|Marma]]: also a major language of [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] State, [[Burma]]
* Tripuri languages: a major language group of [[Tripura]] State, India
** [[Kok Borok language|Kok Borok]]
** [[Reang language|Riang]]
** [[Tippera language|Tippera]]

==Other languages==

===English (previous colonial and co-official language)===
{{Main article|Bangladeshi English}}
[[English language|English]] is a co-official language of Bangladesh and is widely used in the executive, legislative and judicial branches. Bangladesh's [[Constitution of Bangladesh|Constitution]] and laws were written in English and are now being re-written in the Bengali. It is also widely used in [[List of schools in Bangladesh|schools]], [[List of colleges in Bangladesh|colleges]] and [[List of universities in Bangladesh|universities]] as a [[medium of instruction]].

===Arabic (previous ceremonial language, religious and minor literary language)===
[[Arabic language|Arabic]] (عربي) was an official language ever since the [[History of Bangladesh#Late_Middle_Ages_–_Advent_of_Islam|territory]] of the modern state [[People's Republic of Bangladesh]] became a part of the [[Bengal Sultanate]]. However some disagree and believe the presence of Arabic came before during the [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Arabic is used in many [[Muslim]] congregations such as the weekly [[Jumu'ah]] Salah in which a sermon ([[khutbah]]) is given in Arabic in addition to Bengali. In the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]], there are two references to Arabic to in the introduction and Part I of the constitution. The document begins with the Arabic phrase [[Basmala|بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ]] which is translated as “In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful”. Article 2A declares that Islam is the state religion of the republic.

Arabic is the religious language of Muslims. The [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]], [[Hadith]] and [[Muslim]] theology is taught in Arabic with [[Bengali language|Bengali]] translation. The [[Bangladeshi diaspora]] living in the [[Middle East]] has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Bangladesh. Arabic is taught as a religious language in [[mosque]]s, [[school]]s, [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] and [[Madrasah|madrassahs]] as well as in tradition [[Bengali Muslim]] households. A majority of Bangladesh's [[Muslim]] population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]] as part of their religious education.

===Persian (previous colonial language)===
{{Main article|Persian language in South Asia}}
*[http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Persian "Farsi in Bangladesh"] — Banglapedia

From ancient times Bengal and Persia had been in contact with each other. There were many trading posts around coastal Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Persian|title=Persian - Banglapedia|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As people converted to Islam, they became acquainted with Arabic scriptures, as well as with Persian, the language of the Sufi preachers. The influence of the language spread rapidly after it gained the status of court language and it was the official for over 600 years (1203-1837 AD).

===Urdu (previous language)===
{{Main article|Bengali language movement}}
{{See also|Biharis in Bangladesh}}
[[Urdu]] (اردو‬) was an official language in [[East Pakistan]]. It is still spoken by the [[Biharis in Bangladesh]] and is taught in some [[madrasa]]hs.

'''''Le Bon Usage''''' ({{IPA-fr|lə bɔn‿yzaʒ}}, ''Good Usage''), informally called '''''Le Grevisse''''', is a descriptive{{cn|date=February 2016}} book about [[French grammar]] first published in 1936 by [[Maurice Grevisse]], and periodically revised since.  It describes the usage of the [[French language]], primarily in its written literary form.

== Description ==
Quite extensive (1600 pages), it includes numerous examples and counter-examples taken from francophone literature of various periods, including newspapers, to form a reference for teachers of French, and in particular, authors and editors.

==Editions==

[[Image:Le Bon usage.jpg|thumb|right|16th Edition]]
In 1936, the first edition was published by De Boeck Supérieur (then named Duculot).  A new edition was published in 1939, and another in 1946.  The book was awarded the gold medal of the [[Académie française]]. The high praise of [[André Gide]] in the literary supplement of ''[[Le Figaro]]'' in February 1947 contributed to its success.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Grevisse répond à toutes les questions flottantes ; y répond si pertinemment que je n'aurais qu'à le copier pour satisfaire aux inquiétudes et aux doutes de mes plus scrupuleux correspondants. Je les invite à s'adresser directement à ce remarquable ouvrage." André Gide, ''Figaro littéraire'', 8 February 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Grevisse in 1980, his son-in-law [[André Goosse]], also a grammarian, took over and published the 12th and 13th (1993) editions. The 14th edition was published in August 2007 in a completely new format. The 15th edition appeared in 2011. Since then there has been a 16th edition.

'''Liebherr Export AG v Ellison Trading Ltd''' is a New Zealand legal case regarding certainty in [[contract]] formation.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page={{page needed|date=January 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=39-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Ellison Trading was the sole New Zealand distributor of machinery for Liebherr Export since 1977. In November 1993, suddenly informed Ellison during a dinner that Liebherr Australia was taking over the New Zealand distributorship.

Besides just being advised that he had just lost their business, the Liebherr Australia representative also informed them that they did not want to buy back any of the $800,000 in Liebherr parts that Ellison was contracted under the distribution agreement.

The Liebherr AG representative thought this was unfair, and last got Liebherr Australia to agree to purchase the parts back at a "fair and reasonable" price.

Liebherr Australia subsequently negotiations with Ellison to purchase their stock, but talks broke down after Liebherr wanted to offer less than cost price, as well as excluding from purchase much of the stock.

Liebherr eventually walked away, claiming they had no legal obligation to purchase the stock.

A less than impressed Ellison sued Liebherr under the agreement to purchase the stock, which Liebherr defended that they denied even making the offer to purchase, and if they did, they claimed that the term "fair and reasonable" lacked certainty and therefore made such a contract not legally enforceable.

The High Court ruled in favour of Ellison, and Liebherr appealed.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal agreeing with the High Court that Liebherr did agree to purchase the stock, and that the term "fair and reasonable" could be remedied by the courts if the parties could not come to an agreed price.

It is a [[transliteration]] of the Ancient Greek word [[wikt:Unsupported titles/Ancient Greek dish|λοπαδο&amp;shy;τεμαχο&amp;shy;σελαχο&amp;shy;γαλεο&amp;shy;κρανιο&amp;shy;λειψανο&amp;shy;δριμ&amp;shy;υπο&amp;shy;τριμματο&amp;shy;σιλφιο&amp;shy;καραβο&amp;shy;μελιτο&amp;shy;κατακεχυ&amp;shy;μενο&amp;shy;κιχλ&amp;shy;επι&amp;shy;κοσσυφο&amp;shy;φαττο&amp;shy;περιστερ&amp;shy;αλεκτρυον&amp;shy;οπτο&amp;shy;κεφαλλιο&amp;shy;κιγκλο&amp;shy;πελειο&amp;shy;λαγῳο&amp;shy;σιραιο&amp;shy;βαφη&amp;shy;τραγανο&amp;shy;πτερύγων]].

The Greek word has 172 letters and 78 syllables. The transliteration has 182 Latin characters. It is the longest word ever to appear in literature according to [[Guinness World Records]] (1990).&lt;ref name="google129"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EKSHvbY5howC&amp;q=%22longest+word%22+aristophanes&amp;dq=%22longest+word%22 Guinness Book of World Records, 1990 ed, pg. 129] {{ISBN|0-8069-5790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variant forms==
The form of the word quoted here is in fact, the one listed in LSJ (1940) and quoted therein as having been amended by [[August Meineke]];&lt;ref name="LSJ"/&gt; in contrast to this, [[Frederick William Hall (academic)|F.W. Hall]] and [[William Martin Geldart|W.M.

==Description==
The dish was a [[fricassée]], with at least 16 sweet and sour ingredients, including the following:&lt;ref name="google129"/&gt;

* [[fish]] slices
* fish of the [[elasmobranchii]] subclass (a [[shark]] or [[Batoidea|ray]])
* rotted [[Squaliformes|dogfish]] or [[Shark|small shark's]] head
* generally sharp-tasting dish of several ingredients grated and pounded together
* [[silphion]] "[[laserwort]]", apparently a kind of [[giant fennel]]
* a kind of [[crab]], [[shrimp]], or [[crayfish]]
* [[honey]] poured down
* [[wrasse]] (or [[Thrush (bird)|thrush]])
* a kind of sea [[fish]] or [[common blackbird|blackbird]] as topping
* [[Common Wood Pigeon|wood pigeon]]
* [[domestic pigeon]]
* [[rooster]]
* roasted head of [[little grebe|dabchick]]
* [[hare]], which could be a kind of [[bird]] or a kind of [[sea hare]]
* [[Must|new wine boiled down]]
* [[wing]] and/or [[fin]]

==Context==
The term is used in the ultimate chorus of the play when Blepyrus (and the audience) are summoned to the first feast laid on by the new system.

== English translations ==
In English prose translation by [[Leo Strauss]] (1966), this Greek word is rendered as "oysters-saltfish-skate-sharks'-heads-left-over-vinegar-dressing-laserpitium-leek-with-honey-sauce-thrush-blackbird-pigeon-dove-roast-cock's-brains-wagtail-cushat-hare-stewed-in-new-wine-gristle-of-veal-pullet's-wings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/LeoStraussOnAristophanesEcclesiazusaeTranslation1966/StraussAristophanes-Ecclesiazusae#page/n75/mode/2up |title=Leo Strauss: On Aristophanes' Ecclesiazusae, &amp; translation [1966&amp;#93; |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English verse translation by [[Benjamin Bickley Rogers]] (1902) follows the original meter and the original way of composition:

{{poemquote|Plattero-filleto-mulleto-turboto-
-Cranio-morselo-pickleo-acido-
-Silphio-honeyo-pouredonthe-topothe-

Older English verse translation by Rev. Rowland Smith (1833) destroys the originally composed word and breaks it in several verses:

{{poemquote|All sorts of good cheer;
Limpets, oysters, salt fish,
And a skate too a dish,
Lampreys, with the remains
Of sharp sauce and birds' brains,
With honey so luscious,
Plump blackbirds and thrushes,
Cocks' combs and ring doves,
Which each epicure loves,
Also wood-pigeons blue,
With juicy snipes too,
And to close all, O rare!
The wings of jugged hare!}}

The translation edited by O'Neill, quoted above, does not translate this word and uses only a transliteration.

'''''Navio da República Portuguesa''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "Ship of the Portuguese Republic"), abbreviated as '''N.R.P.''' or '''NRP''', is a [[ship prefix]] used to identify a [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] ship of the [[Portuguese Navy]].

During the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese Monarchy era]], there was not a standard method of referring to the Royal Portuguese Navy's ships. After the [[5 October 1910 revolution|establishment of the Portuguese Republic on 5 October 1910]], all the Portuguese Navy's naval ships started to be officially referred by her name preceded by ''Navio da República Portuguesa'' or its abbreviation.

After July 1981, the Portuguese Navy's vessels not considered as naval ships came to be officially referred to by the prefix ''Unidade Auxiliar da Marinha'' (Navy's Auxiliary Unit), abbreviated as U.A.M. or UAM.

Sometimes, some of Navy Portuguese vessels are referred by alternative prefixes that indicate their function or type, as N.E. for ''Navio-Escola'' ([[training ship|school ship]]) or N.H. for ''Navio Hidrográfico'' ([[Research vessel#Hydrographic survey|hydrographic ship]]). For example, although the official name of the school ship ''[[NRP Sagres III|Sagres]]'' be N.R.P. ''Sagres'', is occasionally referred to as N.E. ''Sagres''.

The '''Network Information Service''', or '''NIS''' (originally called '''Yellow Pages''' or '''YP'''), is a [[client–server]] [[directory service]] [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] for distributing system configuration data such as user and [[host name]]s between [[computer]]s on a [[computer network]]. [[Sun Microsystems]] developed the NIS; the technology is licensed  to virtually all other [[Unix]] vendors.

Because [[British Telecom]] PLC owned the name "[[Yellow Pages]]" as a registered [[trademark]] in the [[United Kingdom]] for its paper-based, commercial [[telephone directory]], Sun changed the name of its system to NIS, though all the commands and functions still start with "yp".

A NIS/YP system maintains and distributes a central directory of user and group information, hostnames, e-mail aliases and other text-based tables of information in a computer network. For example, in a common [[Unix|UNIX]] environment, the list of users for [[Identification (information)|identification]] is placed in &lt;tt&gt;[[Passwd (file)|/etc/passwd]]&lt;/tt&gt;, and secret [[authentication]] [[Cryptographic hash function|hashes]] in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/tt&gt;. NIS adds another "global" user list which is used for identifying users on any [[Client (computing)|client]] of the NIS domain.

Administrators have the ability to configure NIS to serve password data to outside processes to authenticate users using various versions of the Unix [[Crypt (C)|crypt(3)]] hash algorithms.  However, in such cases, any NIS(0307) client can retrieve the entire password database for offline inspection. [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] was designed to handle authentication in a more secure manner.

==Successor technologies==
The original NIS design was seen to have inherent limitations, especially in the areas of scalability and security, so other technologies have come to replace it.

Sun introduced [[NIS+]] as part of [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris 2]] in 1992, with the intention for it to eventually supersede NIS.  NIS+ features much stronger security and authentication features, as well as a hierarchical design intended to provide greater scalability and flexibility.  However, it was also more cumbersome to set up and administer, and was more difficult to integrate into an existing NIS environment than many existing users wished.  [[NIS+]] has been removed from Solaris 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/end-of-notices/eonsolaris11-392732.html |title=End of Feature Notices for Oracle Solaris 11 |date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many users chose to stick with NIS, and over time other modern and secure distributed directory systems, most notably [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]] (LDAP), came to replace it. For example, &lt;code&gt;[[slapd]]&lt;/code&gt; (the standalone LDAP [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]) generally runs as a non-root user, and [[Simple Authentication and Security Layer|SASL]]-based encryption of LDAP traffic is natively supported.

On large [[LAN]]s, [[Domain name system|DNS]] servers may provide better [[nameserver]] functionality than NIS or LDAP can provide, leaving just site-wide identification information for NIS master and slave systems to serve. However, some functions{{mdashb}}such as the distribution of netmask information to clients, as well as the maintenance of e-mail aliases{{mdashb}}may still be performed by NIS or LDAP.  NIS maintains an [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]] database information file as well as so called maps.

The '''''Pergamon World Atlas''''' (in English, 1968) was originally prepared by the [[Polish Army]] Topographical Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Association for the Advancement of Science|title=Science books: a quarterly review|volume=4|year=1968|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science.|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published as the '''''Atlas Świata''''' (World Atlas) in 1962.

The [[atlas (cartography)|atlas]] contains 380 pages of maps, figures and tables along with an index of 150,000 entries. Each geographic map is accompanied by a selection of [[thematic map]]s and [[city map]]s. The ''Pergamon'' added extra maps of the United Kingdom and Canada.

The '''''Periplus of the Euxine Sea''''' ({{lang-el|Περίπλους τοῦ Εὐξείνου Πόντου}}, {{lang-la|Periplus Ponti Euxini}}) is a [[periplus]] or guidebook detailing the destinations visitors encounter when traveling about the shore of the [[Black Sea]]. It was written by [[Arrian|Arrian of Nicomedia]] from AD 130-131.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Background==
It is in the form of a letter, from Arrian to the Emperor [[Hadrian]] in [[Rome]], who was particularly attached to geographical research and had visited in person a large portion of his extensive dominions. It contains an accurate topographical survey of the coasts of the Euxine (Black Sea), from [[Trabzon|Trapezus]] to [[Byzantium]], and was written probably while Arrian held his office of legate of [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]], a short time before war broke out against the [[Alans|Alani]]; and it was doubtless at the same time that he drew up his instructions for the march of the Roman army against the barbarians, which are found in a short but imperfect fragment annexed to the ''[[Techne Taktika]]'', written, as he states himself, in the twentieth year of the reign of the emperor, and containing, after a brief account of former writers on the same subject, a description of the order and arrangement of an army in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Its purpose was to inform the emperor of the "lay of the land" and provide him with necessary information such as the distances between cities and the locations that would provide safe harbor for ships in a storm in the eventuality that Hadrian should mount a military expedition to the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

The ''Periplus'' contains, according to [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]]'s epigrammatic expression in his 42nd chapter, "whatever the governor of Cappadocia had seen from Trebizond to [[Sukhumi|Dioscurias]]; whatever he had heard, from Dioscurias to the [[Danube]]; and whatever he knew, from the Danube to Trebizond."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Prescott House Museum''' is a historic house and gardens located in [[Starr's Point, Nova Scotia]] which is part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]]. Built between 1812 and 1816 by [[Charles Ramage Prescott]] as the centrepiece of his country estate called "Acacia Grove", it is one of the best preserved [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] houses in Canada. 

==History==
Prescott, a wealthy merchant from  [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] purchased the land in 1811 when he took early retirement from his shipping and trading career. He used Acacia Grove as a base for agricultural experiments, importing a wide variety of plants, especially [[apple]] varieties which he shared freely with area growers. When Prescott died in 1859, the house was purchased and maintained for several decades by the Kaye family. However later owners neglected the house and by the 1890s, it fell into ruin. In 1931 the property was purchased by Mary Allison Prescott, the great granddaughter of Charles Prescott. She restored the house and lived in it with her two sisters until 1970. They donated the house to the Province of [[Nova Scotia]] in 1971. 

The house was designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|1152|Acacia Grove / Prescott House|22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also a Provincially Registered Property under the province's [[Heritage Property Act (Nova Scotia)|Heritage Property Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CRHP|1499|Prescott House|22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum==
The house is operated as part of the [[Nova Scotia Museum]] system and explores Prescott's life, [[Georgian architecture]], the apple industry and the lives of the Prescott sisters. Fully restored rooms depict both the Georgian period of Charles Prescott's time and the later era of the 1930s and 40s when it was restored by the Prescott sisters. Open from May to October, the museum offers guided tours of the period rooms and hosts a variety of regular events to interpret the house and its gardens for families and children.

A '''privilege log''' is a document that describes documents or other items withheld from production in a civil lawsuit under a claim that the documents are "[[Privilege (evidence)|privileged]]" from disclosure due to the [[attorney–client privilege]], [[work product doctrine]], joint defense doctrine, or some other privilege.  Rule 26(b)(5)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that a party who withholds information on grounds of privilege must (i) expressly make the claim; and (2) describe the nature of the documents, communications, or tangible things not produced or disclosed—and do so in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable other parties to assess the claim.  A party withholding privileged documents from discovery complies with Rule 26(b)(5)(A) by producing a log containing the following information for each withheld document:  the date, type of document, author(s), recipient(s), general subject-matter of the document, and the privilege being claimed (e.g., attorney-client). A production log or similar document may explain where documents on the privilege log were found, identify lawyers on the log, or provide other information.

Whenever a claim of privilege is made, the person making the claim has the burden of showing that the privilege applies. Therefore, it is generally the withholding party's burden to provide sufficient information on its privilege log to allow the opposing party to assess the claim of privilege, inquire further, or seek ''[[in camera]]'' review of the withheld documents or other Court involvement, if necessary.

A '''recipe''' is a set of instructions that describes how to prepare or make something, especially a culinary [[dish (food)|dish]]. It is also used in medicine or in information technology (user acceptance). A doctor will usually begin a [[Medical prescription|prescription]] with ''recipe'', Latin for ''take'', usually abbreviated to Rx or an equivalent symbol (℞).

==History==

===Early examples===
[[File:Apicius 1541.jpg|thumb|right|Apicius, ''De re culinaria'', an early collection of recipes.]]
The earliest known written recipes date from approximately 1600 BC and come from an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] tablet from southern [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Bottéro, ''Textes culinaires Mésopotamiens'', 1995. {{ISBN|0-931464-92-7}}; commentary at [http://www.semeia.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=703 Society of Biblical Literature]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also works in [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[hieroglyph]]s depicting the preparation of food.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Egyptian cuisine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ancient Greek recipes are known. [[Mithaecus]]'s cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost; [[Athenaeus]] quotes one short recipe in his [[Deipnosophistae]]. [[Athenaeus]] mentions many other cookbooks, all of them lost.&lt;ref name=dalby&gt;[[Andrew Dalby]], ''Food in the Ancient World from A to Z'', 2003. {{ISBN|0-415-23259-7}} p. 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman recipes are known starting in the 2nd century BCE with [[Cato the Elder]]'s [[De Agri Cultura]]. Many authors of this period described eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and in Latin.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt; Some [[Punic]] recipes are known in Greek and Latin translation.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt;

The large collection of recipes ''De re coquinaria'', conventionally titled [[Apicius]], appeared in the 4th or 5th century and is the only complete surviving cookbook from the classical world.&lt;ref name=dalby /&gt; It lists the courses served in a meal as Gustatio (appetizer), Primae Mensae (main course) and Secundae Mensae (dessert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Roman food in Britain | accessdate =  2007-05-10 | url = http://romans-in-britain.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipe begins with the Latin command "Take...," "Recipe...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Colquhoun |first1=Kate |title=Taste: The Story of Britain through its Cooking |date=2008 |origyear=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury |isbn=978-0-747-59306-5 |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabic recipes are documented starting in the 10th century; see [[Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq|al-Warraq]] and [[Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi|al-Baghdadi]].

The earliest recipe in [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] dates from the 14th century. Several recipes have survived from the time of [[Safavid]]s, including ''Karnameh'' (1521) by Mohammad Ali Bavarchi, which includes the cooking instruction of more than 130 different dishes and pastries, and ''Madat-ol-Hayat'' (1597) by Nurollah Ashpaz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-of-music.net/ppdf/nppdf/2835/p0283539930101.pdf Jaam-e Jam]&lt;/ref&gt; Recipe books from the [[Qajar]] period are numerous, the most notable being ''Khorak-ha-ye Irani'' by prince Nader Mirza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=کتاب خوراک های ایرانی | website=مجله تصویری فرهنگ غذا | date=December 3, 2016 | url=http://foodculture.ir/food-culture/%da%a9%d8%aa%d8%a7%d8%a8-%d8%ae%d9%88%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9-%d9%87%d8%a7%db%8c-%d8%a7%db%8c%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%86%db%8c-%d8%af%d8%b1-%d8%b2%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%86-%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%ac%d8%a7%d8%b1/ | language=fa | ref={{sfnref | مجله تصویری فرهنگ غذا | 2016}} | access-date=November 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King Richard II of England commissioned a recipe book called ''[[Forme of Cury]]'' in 1390,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = COMDA Calendar Co. | title = 2007 Recipe Calendar | publisher = COMDA, Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; and around the same time, another book was published entitled ''[[Curye on Inglish]]'', "cury" meaning cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hicatt | first = Constance B | author2 = Sharon Butler | title = English Culinary Manuscripts of the 14C | year = 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both books give an impression of how food for the noble classes was prepared and served [[English cuisine|in England]] at that time. The luxurious taste of the [[aristocracy]] in the [[Early Modern Period]] brought with it the start of what can be called the modern recipe book. By the 15th century, numerous manuscripts were appearing detailing the recipes of the day. Many of these manuscripts give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including [[coriander]], parsley, basil and [[rosemary]], many of which had been brought back from the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Austin | first = Thomas | title = Ashmole and other Manuscripts | year = 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern recipes and cooking advice===
[[Image:ActonFish.jpg|thumb|from ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'' by Eliza Acton (London: Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, 1871. p.48.)]]
With the advent of the [[printing press]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, numerous books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sieben | first = Ria Jansen | title = Een notable boecxtken van cokeryen | year = 1588}}&lt;/ref&gt; and England,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = anon | title = The good Huswifes handmaid for Cookerie | year = 1588 }}&lt;/ref&gt; competition grew between the noble families as to who could prepare the most lavish banquet. By the 1660s, cookery progressed to an art form and good cooks were in demand. Many families published their own books detailing their recipes in competition with their rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = May | first = Robert | title = The accomplifht Cook |  year = 1685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books have been translated and are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Medieval Cookbooks | author = Judy Gerjuoy | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | url = http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/articles/food_bibliography.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 19th century, the Victorian preoccupation for domestic respectability brought about the emergence of cookery writing in its modern form. Although eclipsed in fame and regard by [[Isabella Beeton]], the first modern cookery writer and compiler of recipes for the home was [[Eliza Acton]]. Her pioneering cookbook, ''Modern Cookery for Private Families'' published in 1845, was aimed at the domestic reader rather than the professional cook or chef. This was immensely influential, establishing the format for modern writing about cookery. It introduced the now-universal practice of listing the ingredients and suggested cooking times with each recipe. It included the first recipe for [[Brussels sprouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, ''Food For Thought: Extraordinary Little Chronicles of the World'', (2004) pg 144&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary chef [[Delia Smith]] called Acton "the best writer of recipes in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hub-uk.com/interesting/delia-british-library.htm Interview].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Modern Cookery'' long survived Acton, remaining in print until 1914 and available more recently in facsimile.

[[File:Isabella Beeton - Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management - title page.jpg|thumb|left|270x270px|Titlepage of ''Beeton's Book of Household Management'']]
Acton's work was an important influence on Isabella Beeton,&lt;ref name=Acton&gt;{{cite book|title=Acton, Eliza (1799–1859)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591300080.html|work=[[Women in World History|Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia]]|publisher=Gale Research Inc.|accessdate=8 January 2013|date=January 2002}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published ''[[Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management]]'' in 24 monthly parts between 1857 and 1861. This was a guide to running a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] household, with advice on fashion, [[child care]], [[animal husbandry]], [[poison]]s, the management of [[Domestic worker|servants]], science, religion, and industrialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/beeton/isabella/household/chapter16.html:''General Observations on the Common Hog'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tracingpaper.org.uk/2007/04/21/food-in-season-in-1861/''Food in season in April 1861'']&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 1,112 pages, over 900 contained recipes. Most were illustrated with coloured engravings. It is said that many of the recipes were plagiarised from earlier writers such as Acton, but the Beetons never claimed that the book's contents were original. It was intended as a reliable guide for the aspirant middle classes.

The American cook [[Fannie Farmer]] (1857–1915) published in 1896 her famous work ''The Boston Cooking School Cookbook'' which contained some 1,849 recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cunningham | first = Marion | title = The Fannie Farmer Cookbook (revised) | publisher = Bantam Books, New York | year = 1979 | isbn = 978-0-553-56881-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pistachio cake.png|thumb|250px|right|Recipe with ingredients integrated into the method]]
Modern culinary recipes normally consist of several components
* The name of the recipe (Origins/History of the dish)
* Yield: The number of servings that the dish provides.
* List all ingredients in the order of its use. Describe it in step by step instructions.
* Listing ingredients by the quantity (Write out abbreviations. Ounces instead of oz).
* How much time does it take to prepare the dish, plus cooking time for the dish.
* Necessary equipment used for the dish.
* Cooking procedures. Temperature and bake time if necessary.
* Serving procedures (Served while warm/cold).
* Review of the dish (Would you recommend this dish to a friend?).
* Photograph of the dish (Optional).
* Nutritional Value: Helps for dietary restrictions. Includes number of calories or grams per serving.


Earlier recipes often included much less information, serving more as a reminder of ingredients and proportions for someone who already knew how to prepare the dish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Paradowski|first1=Michał B.|title=Through catering college to the naked chef – teaching LSP and culinary translation.

Recipe writers sometimes also list variations of a traditional dish, to give different tastes of the same recipes.

==Internet and television recipes==
By the mid 20th century, there were thousands of cookery and recipe books available. The next revolution came with the introduction of the TV cooks. The first TV cook in England was [[Fanny Cradock]] with a show on the BBC. TV cookery programs brought recipes to a new audience. In the early days, recipes were available by post from the BBC; later with the introduction of [[CEEFAX]] text on screen, they became available on television.

The first Internet [[Usenet newsgroup]] dedicated to cooking was ''net.cooks'' created in 1982, later becoming ''[news:///rec.food.cooking rec.food.cooking]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Victor |last=Sack |title=rec.food.cooking FAQ and conversion file |at=sec. 6.1 |url=http://vsack.homepage.t-online.de/rfc_faq0.html#6.1 |date=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It served as a forum to share recipes text files and cooking techniques.

In the early 21st century, there has been a renewed focus on cooking at home due to the [[late-2000s recession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124148676424885935|title=Web Recipes Are Cooking With Gas |last= Holmes |first=Elizabeth |date=2009-05-05 |publisher=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television networks such as the [[Food Network]] and magazines are still a major source of recipe information, with international cooks and chefs such as [[Jamie Oliver]], [[Gordon Ramsay]], [[Nigella Lawson]] and [[Rachael Ray]] having prime-time shows and backing them up with Internet websites giving the details of all their recipes. These were joined by reality TV shows such as [[Top Chef]] or [[Iron Chef]], and many Internet sites offering free recipes, but cookery books remain as popular as ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cookbooks surge to top category at libraries | author=Andriani, Lynn | accessdate=2013-10-14| url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/cooking/article/46214-cookbooks-surge-to-top-category-at-libraries.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipe design tools==
[[Molecular gastronomy]] provides [[chef]]s with cooking techniques and ingredients, but this discipline also provides new theories and methods which aid recipe design. These methods are used by [[chef]]s, [[foodie]]s, home cooks and even [[Bartender|mixologists]] worldwide to improve or design recipes.

A '''shield law''' is legislation designed to protect [[Reporter's privilege|reporters' privilege]].  This privilege involves the right of news reporters to refuse to testify as to information and/or sources of information obtained during the news gathering and dissemination process. Currently the [[United States|U.S.]] federal government has not enacted any national shield laws, but most of the 50 states do have shield laws or other protections for reporters in place.

==Definition==
A shield law is law that gives reporters protection against being forced to disclose confidential information or sources in state court. There is no federal shield law and state shield laws vary in scope.  In general, however, a shield law aims to provide the classic protection of, "a reporter cannot be forced to reveal his or her source" law. Thus, a shield law provides a privilege to a reporter pursuant to which the reporter cannot be forced by subpoena or other court order to testify about information contained in a news story and/or the source of that information.  Several shield laws additionally provide protection for the reporter even if the source or information is revealed during the dissemination of the news story, that is whether or not the source or information is confidential. Shield laws do not ensure absolute protection.&lt;ref&gt;Graber, Doris A. ''Mass Media and American Politics''. Washington, DC: CQ, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the jurisdiction, the privilege may be total or qualified, and it may also apply to other persons involved in the news-gathering and dissemination process as well, such as an editor or a publisher.

==Origins==
The issue of whether or not journalists can be subpoenaed and forced to reveal confidential information arose in 1972 with the United States Supreme Court case ''[[Branzburg v. Hayes]]''. Paul Branzburg was a reporter for ''[[The Courier-Journal]]'' in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and wrote an article about the drug [[hashish]]. In creating the article, he came in contact with two local citizens who had created and used the drug. Because their activity was illegal, Branzburg promised the two individuals that he would not reveal their identities. After the article was published, Branzburg was subpoenaed by a local grand jury and ordered to reveal the identity of his sources. Branzburg refused and cited the provisions for freedom of the press from the First Amendment of the Constitution, in his defense.

The case eventually reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], where the court decided in a five to four decision that the press did not have a Constitutional right of protection from revealing confidential information in court. The court acknowledged, however, that the government must "convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0408_0665_ZD1.html "Branzburg v. Hayes"] on the [[Legal Information Institute]] website of [[Cornell University Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt; While this ruling did not set a precedent for journalistic rights in court, it did define a more stringent set of requirements for when a journalist could be subpoenaed in court.

This ruling was limited in nature, did not set a clear federal precedent regarding journalistic privileges from revealing confidential information, and thus has been interpreted and cited differently by courts over the years. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, for instance, has gleaned a qualified First Amendment privilege from the ''Branzburg'' decision. In ''Riley v. City of Chester'', the Court held that a reporter's right to protect his sources from disclosure could be overcome by a party who, by a preponderance of the evidence, demonstrated that he has made an effort to obtain the information elsewhere, that the only access to the information sought is through the journalist and his or her source, and that the information sought is crucial to the case. 612 F.2d 708 (3rd Cir. 1979).&lt;ref&gt;http://altlaw.org/v1/cases/545663&lt;/ref&gt;

==State laws==

States differ on their approach to protecting reporter's privilege. {{As of|2011}}, 49 states and the [[District of Columbia]] offer some form of protections&lt;ref&gt;Rozell, Mark J., and Jeremy D. Mayer. 2008. Media Power Media Politics. Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc. pg 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Forty states (plus D.C.) have passed shield laws.&lt;ref name="SPLC"&gt;{{cite web |title=State-by-State Guide to the Reporter's Privilege for Student Media |url=http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/legalresearch.asp?id=60 |work=SPLC.org |publisher=Student Press Law Center |year=2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws vary from state to state. Some protections apply to civil but not to criminal proceedings. Other laws protect journalists from revealing confidential sources, but not other information. Many states have also established court precedents which provide protection to journalists, usually based on constitutional arguments. Only Wyoming lacks both legislation and judicial precedent to protect reporter's privilege.&lt;ref name="SPLC"/&gt;

==Current issues==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
Proponents of shield laws argue that they ensure that news gatherers may do their jobs to their fullest ability and that they help avoid a dichotomy between state laws and journalistic ethics, but the differences between states' laws has raised questions regarding which laws apply where in regard to national reporting.  Proponents argue that a federal shield law should exist to eliminate contradictions between state laws.

Opponents argue that shield laws afford extra privileges to journalists and that no citizen should be able to ignore a court ordered subpoena. Opponents also cite problems with defining who is considered a journalist or news gatherer and who is not, and note that if journalists get special protection from the government, then they are getting special journalistic benefits from the government instead of acting in complete independence.  Some opponents also argue that journalists are often forced to testify by federal courts only in cases where a federal shield law likely would not protect them anyway.  Finally, the federal government may not have constitutional right to enforce a shield law on state courts.

Many journalists, however, are subpoenaed to testify in criminal and civil cases for coverage of a variety of matters that do not involve questions of national security.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, RonNell Andersen. "Avalanche or Undue Alarm? An Empirical Study of Subpoenas Received by the News Media", 93 MINN. L. REV. 585, 639–40 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, there have been bills for federal shield laws in the United States Congress; however, none of these bills have passed the Senate.  A primary objection to recent efforts to pass a federal shield law has been concern about leaks of classified information, particularly given the modern potential of such leaks to be published globally on the Internet by non-traditional recipients, such as WikiLeaks, who might claim to be "journalists" under an unqualified shield law.&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, W. Cory. "Crime That Plays: Shaping a Reporter's Shield to Cover National Security in an Insecure World", 44 WAKE FOREST L. REV. 641 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, the press is not even immune from its sources, such as when the source wishes to remain anonymous and the journalist wishes to disclose it. Such was the case in ''[[Cohen v. Cowles Media Co.]]'' (1991). The Supreme Court upheld that a source may have a right to confidentiality if an agreement was made with the reporter.  Unfortunately, the bigger issue of source disclosure gets even more confusing, since the ''Cohen'' and ''Branzburg'' decisions could allow for the possibility of a journalist being subpoenaed by a court to disclose the name of a source, and being sued by a source under promissory estoppel laws for that disclosure.  The current laws of the land, and the gray areas of forecasting potential consequences of publishing a story with confidential sources places the press in a very precarious situation.  The current shield laws in some states give the press somewhat of an upper hand. However, since federal law does not recognize reportorial privilege in most cases, it is understandable how the press might feel muzzled.

The shield law privilege may also be waived by a reporter, as the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] recently found in the case of ''In re Michael G. Venezia''.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Michael G. Venezia'', 191 ''N.J.'' 259, 922 ''A.2d'' 1263 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  In that case, a New Jersey newspaper published an article containing defamatory statements about the plaintiff.  The article attributed the statements to a source who was identified by name in the article; the source later denied making the defamatory statements.  The plaintiff filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, the reporter and the alleged source of the defamatory statements.  When the plaintiff sought to question the newspaper reporter about the article, the reporter and his newspaper refused, claiming protection under New Jersey's shield law.{{Cite NJSA|title=2A|chapter=84A|section=21|citeonly=true}}  It was discovered, however, that the reporter had already given a statement under oath concerning the article—and, most important, the alleged source of the statement and exactly what that source said—to a local county prosecutor's office.  The reporter also talked about his source and what the source said with a local municipal attorney.  The ''Venezia'' court unanimously held that, while New Jersey has arguably the most protective shield law in the United States, a reporter waives the privilege when he talks about his sources and information outside of the newsgathering process, as did the reporter in ''Venezia.''  The ''Venezia'' court stated: "The privilege holder is not permitted to step from behind the shield as he pleases, sallying forth one moment to make a disclosure to one person and then to seek the shield's protection from having to repeat the same disclosure to another person.  A reporter cannot play peek-a-boo with the privilege."  Thus, the ''Venezia'' court ordered that the reporter must submit to the plaintiff's deposition request.  ''Venezia'' is highly significant because it marks the first time that a reporter has ever been found to have waived the privilege under New Jersey's current shield law, and because it explores the issue of what is or is not a "newsgathering activity," and, thus, what activities are subject to protection under the law.

Currently, courts are struggling to define the standards for when shield laws should apply to non-traditional media outlets, particularly in the context of blogs and Internet publishing. In ''[[Obsidian Finance Group, LLC v. Cox]]'', the [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon]] found that to qualify as a reporter, a standard of professionalism  must be met, including but not limited to being associated with a traditional news print or television media outlet or obtaining a journalism degree. A subsequent opinion in the same case clarified that these were examples and not requirements; bloggers could qualify, and the denial of media status in the Cox case appears to have been largely motivated by the defendant reportedly offering to remove accusations for a substantial fee. Conversely, in ''[[The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. Implode-Explode Heavy Industries, Inc.]]'' the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] adopted a much broader definition of media that applies to blogs and website curators, reiterating that "freedom of the press is a fundamental personal right which is not confined to newspapers and periodicals."&lt;ref name="opinion"&gt;{{Cite court |litigants=The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. Implode-Explode Heavy Industries, Inc.
|vol=160 |reporter=N.H. |opinion=227 |date=2010 |url=http://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2010/2010041mortg.pdf |accessdate=19 Mar. 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the [[White House]] was pushing for a federal media shield law named the [[Free Flow of Information Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Flow of Information Act of 2009|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.448:|publisher=[[THOMAS|Thomas]]|accessdate=18 July 2013|author=Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham}}&lt;/ref&gt; authored by U.S. Senators [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Lindsey Graham]]. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public's interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a "clear and convincing" standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Charlie|title=Criticized on Seizure of Records, White House Pushes News Media Shield Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/us/politics/under-fire-white-house-pushes-to-revive-media-shield-bill.html?_r=0#h|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk. "Now, it's important to remember: virtually the only time the government subpoenas reporters, it involves leak investigations into stories by national security reporters. So it's hard to see how this bill will significantly help improve press freedom," wrote Trevor Timm, an activist with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and a board member of the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]. "Worse, there's a strong argument that passing the bill [...] will weaken rights reporters already have and make it easier for the government to get sources from reporters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obama's media shield law makes prosecuting journalists even easier|url=http://rt.com/usa/obama-shield-bill-law-453/|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=Russia Today|date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related issues ==
In recent years, a larger effort by journalists to press for federal shield laws formed following the [[Plame affair|Plame affair/CIA leak scandal]], in which reporters who released the name of [[Valerie Plame]] were asked who their sources were. One of the reporters, [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', was jailed for 85 days in 2005 for refusing to disclose her source in the government probe.

There is a question about whether journalists should be exempt from national security laws, or not.&lt;ref&gt;In "Why Journalists Are Not above the Law," Gabriel Schoenfeld talks about the Constitutional freedom of the press. She believes that journalists should not be exempt from national security laws. Schoenfeld feels that journalists should not be able to report on national security issues. Although the shield law is a form of protection, reporters are not covered when it comes to national security.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Stranger than Fiction''''' is a 2006 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[Comedy-drama|comedy-drama film]] directed by [[Marc Forster]], produced by [[Lindsay Doran]], and written by [[Zach Helm]]. The film stars [[Will Ferrell]], [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Queen Latifah]], and [[Emma Thompson]]. The main plot follows Harold Crick (Ferrell), an IRS worker who begins hearing a disembodied voice narrating his life as it happens – seemingly the text of a novel in which it is stated that he will soon die – and he frantically seeks to somehow prevent that ending. The film was shot on location in [[Chicago]], and has been praised for its innovative, intelligent story and fine performances. Ferrell, who came to prominence playing brash comedic parts, garnered particular attention for offering a restrained performance in his first starring dramatic role.

==Plot==
Harold Crick, an [[agent (law)|agent]] for the [[Internal Revenue Service]], lives his life by his wristwatch. He is assigned to audit an [[tax resistance|intentionally tax-delinquent]] baker, Ana Pascal, to whom he is attracted. On the same day, he begins hearing the voice of a woman [[omniscience|omnisciently]] narrating his life but is unable to communicate with it. Harold's watch stops working and he resets it using the time given by a bystander; the voice narrates, "little did he know that this simple, seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent death". Worried by this prediction, Harold consults a [[psychiatrist]] who attributes the voice to [[schizophrenia]], though they consider that if there really is a narrator, he should visit an expert in literature. Crick visits Jules Hilbert, a literature professor, and relates his story. When Jules recognizes aspects of a literary work in Harold's story, he encourages Harold to identify the author, first by determining if the work is a comedy or tragedy.

As Harold audits Ana, the two fall for each other, but when Harold refuses to accept cookies that Ana made for him because they could be viewed as a bribe, Ana tells him to leave, making Harold believe the story is a tragedy. On the advice of Jules, Harold spends the next day at home trying to control his destiny by doing nothing, but his apartment is partially demolished by a wrecking crew that mistook the building for an abandoned one. Jules believes that since Harold cannot control the plot, he should accept his impending death and enjoy whatever time he has left. Harold takes a vacation from work, develops his friendship with his co-worker Dave, fulfills his dream of learning to play the guitar, and dates Ana. Harold reassesses his story as a comedy. When he returns to Jules with this revelation, Harold inadvertently identifies the voice in his head from a television interview as author Karen Eiffel. Jules, an admirer of Karen's work, reveals that all of her books feature the main character's tragic death.

Karen struggles from [[writer's block]] and researches ways to kill the character Harold to complete her next book. Her publisher sends an assistant, Penny Escher, to ensure the book is completed. Harold finds Karen through her tax records. When Karen learns that Harold experiences everything she writes, she is horrified by the thought that her books may have killed real people. She tells Harold she wrote a draft of his death, but has not typed it up yet; the events in the book manifest when she strikes the period key. Penny suggests Harold read the drafted ending to get his opinion. Harold cannot bring himself to read it and gives the manuscript to Jules to review. Jules confirms its excellence, labeling it as Karen's masterpiece; Harold's death is integral to its genius. Though Harold is distressed over his fate, Jules comforts him by stating the inevitability of death: this one death, at least, will have a deeper meaning. Harold reads the manuscript, then returns it to Karen, telling her the death she has written for him is "beautiful" and she should keep it intact. He spends one last night with Ana.

The next day, Harold prepares to return to work, despite Karen's voice narrating as she types up her ending. Because Harold's watch is three minutes fast owing to the imprecise time given to him days ago, he reaches the bus stop early and watches as a young boy falls in front of the oncoming bus. Karen continues writing; Harold leaps from the curb and pushes the child out of the way, but is struck by the bus. Karen cannot complete the sentence confirming Harold's death, and Harold wakes up in a hospital, injured but alive. He learns that fragments of his wristwatch blocked the right [[ulnar artery]] in his body after the collision, saving his life. When Jules reads Karen's final manuscript, he notes that the story is weaker without Harold's death. Karen admits the flaw, but points out that the story was meant to be about a man that dies unexpectedly; with Harold sacrificing himself, the story would have lost its tragic impact. In place of Harold, his wristwatch—[[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] throughout the film—is the character who died tragically.

==Production==
===Writing===
In 2001, writer [[Zach Helm]] was working with producer Clarence Helmus on a project they called "The Disassociate".&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey Doran, "Words on a Page" bonus featurette on DVD&lt;/ref&gt; Helm came to Doran with a new idea involving a man who finds himself accompanied by a narrator that only he can hear. Helm next decided that the narrator should state that the man is going to die since, as Helm described, "There's something very poetic about the understanding of one's place in the universe, but it's far more dramatic when such understanding occurs only days before that life ends." Helm and Doran began referring to the new project as "The Narrator Project" and developed the story through a process of Helm bringing ideas and Doran asking questions. One of Helm's main ideas involved engaging the movie's form as much as its content.&lt;ref name="this original URL"&gt;SONY Pictures Entertainment (2006). [https://www.webcitation.org/5Z75o18wk?url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/stranger-than-fiction/notes.pdf "Stranger than Fiction: Production Notes"], document archived at WebCite July 6, 2008 based on the version posted at [http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies/stranger-than-fiction/notes.pdf this original URL].&lt;/ref&gt;

Helm named each of the film's chief characters after a famous scientist or scientifically influential artist, examples including [[Francis Crick|Crick]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Gustave Eiffel|Eiffel]], [[M. C. Escher|Escher]], and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]].  When the character of Dr. Hilbert tells Harold that he has devised a series of 23 questions in order to investigate the narrator, it is a playful reference to [[Hilbert's 23 problems]].  The film's title derives from a quote by Mark Twain: "Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mark Twain Calendar|year=1917|publisher=Harper and Kleinteich|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Helm, one of the film's major themes is of interconnectivity.  As Helm stated, "Each of these characters ends up doing little things to save one another.  There's an underlying theme that the things we take most for granted are often the ones that make life worth living and actually keep us alive."&lt;ref name="this original URL"/&gt;

===Photography===
The film was shot on location in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Dave's apartment, in which Harold takes residence after his own building is partially demolished, is part of the River City Condominiums.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420223/locations IMDB: Filming locations for – Stranger Than Fiction (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Hilbert's office was in a lecture hall at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. The [[CNA Center]] at 333 South Wabash Avenue in the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] served as the location for the IRS office. The bakery that Ana Pascal runs is actually located in the [[Little Village, Chicago|Little Village]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]] and is presently called ''La Catedral Cafe &amp; Restaurant''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacatedralcafe.com/ La Catedral Cafe &amp; Restaurant]&lt;/ref&gt; The movie theatre in the film is the Logan Theatre located in the [[Logan Square, Chicago|Logan Square]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelogantheatre.com/index.php/info/about-us The Logan Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; Many downtown Chicago locations were used for scenes involving Karen Eiffel, Penny Escher, and Harold Crick.&lt;ref name="imdb.com"/&gt; [[Columbia Pictures]] distributed the film.&lt;ref name="this original URL"/&gt;

The film was in part inspired by ''[[Playtime]]'' (1967), Jacques Tati's visionary comedy about modern urban life, and the cinematography and production design help create a claustrophobic sense of life in the city.&lt;ref name='McCarthy'/&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Stranger than Fiction (soundtrack)}}
The music for this film includes original scores by the collaborative effort of [[Britt Daniel]] (singer/songwriter of [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]]) and [[Brian Reitzell]] (composer for ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]'', ''[[The Bling Ring]]'' and ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]''), as well as a mix of [[indie rock]] songs from various artists including Spoon. Reitzell is also the film's music supervisor. The soundtrack includes an original recording of the song that Harold plays for Ana, "[[(I'd Go The) Whole Wide World|Whole Wide World]]" by [[Wreckless Eric]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}

==Reception==
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 72% approval rating based on 172 reviews; the average rating is 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A fun, whimsical tale about an office drone trying to save his life from his narrator, ''Stranger Than Fiction'' features a subdued performance from Will Ferrell that contributes mightily to its quirky, mind-bending affect."&lt;ref name="rt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stranger_than_fiction/|title=Stranger Than Fiction|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film holds a score of 67 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/stranger-than-fiction|title=Stranger Than Fiction|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=February 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, stating that the film was thought-provoking and moral, and that "Such an uncommonly intelligent film does not often get made...which requires us to enter the lives of these specific quiet, sweet, worthy people", and he also praised Ferrell's performance saying, "Will Ferrell stars, in another role showing that like Steve Martin and Robin Williams he has dramatic gifts to equal his comedic talent".&lt;ref name="RogerEbertReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061109/REVIEWS/611090301|title=Stranger Than Fiction Review|work=Roger Ebert|accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated the film 3 out of 4 stars, stating that though the premise of Ferrell's life being narrated is a set-up for farce, the film is "less self-reflexively clever and more intimate".&lt;ref name="rs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/7601796/review/12308730/stranger_than_fiction|title=Stranger Than Fiction Review|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Todd McCarthy in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' positively reviewed the film, praising its invention and Ferrell's performance as nuanced: first playing a tight focused caricature of the company man, then exercising more humanity and wit without being "goofy".&lt;ref name='McCarthy'&gt;McCarthy, T. [http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=print_story&amp;articleid=VE1117931559&amp;categoryid=2352 Stranger Than Fiction] ''Variety'', September 12, 2006; retrieved February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Six friends come together to try to find fame and fortune by making the world’s most innocent adult movie ever made. Although they have literally no idea what they’re doing, they keep at it and are determined to accomplish their goal...no matter what gets in the way.  

After the clueless crew finally completes the film, they screen it for the first time at the local bar. The brother of a girl whose scene ultimately was not used (besides some brief shots of her face) barges in, takes the reel off the projector, covers it in whiskey and sets it aflame.  

It is revealed that this was the only print they had and that all their work has been lost. However, the cinematographer had been videotaping the entire production process on [[mini DV]] tapes. He then edits these down into a completely innocent documentary, minus the nudity and sex scenes, about the trials and tribulations of making (and then losing) their original film. This new version is released as the titular ''The Amateurs'' which becomes a critical and financial success on the independent film circuit.

{{About|the 1980 television play|the 2014 film|The Imitation Game}}
'''''The Imitation Game''''' is a television play written by [[Ian McEwan]] and directed by [[Richard Eyre]], a BBC ''[[Play for Today]]'', first broadcast on 26 April 1980.

== Plot ==
It is 1940 in [[Frinton]] and 19-year-old Cathy Raine turns down a job at the local munitions factory and, much to the consternation of her parents and boyfriend Tony, joins the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service|ATS]]. She is assigned to a wireless listening station, transcribing [[Enigma code]]d morse transmissions from Nazi Germany and makes friends with Mary. After an altercation in a pub she is moved to [[Bletchley Park]], the centre of the code-breaking operation, only to find herself cleaning and making tea. She overhears the male staff discussing the eponymous '[[Turing test#Imitation Game|Imitation Game]]', devised by Bletchley Park's [[Alan Turing]]. Cathy is befriended by Cambridge mathematics don Turner (based loosely on Turing) and they end up in bed together but for Turner it is a failure and he accuses her of planning it all to humiliate him. Later Cathy is caught in Turner's room reading documents relating to the [[Ultra]] programme, and she is incarcerated in military prison for the remainder of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvcream.co.uk/?p=7780 TV Cream Imitation Game, The]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
Writing in 1980, [[Ian McEwan]] stated: "Initially I wanted to write a play about Alan Turing, one of the founding fathers of modern computers', but his researches provided very little material, 'by this time other facts about Bletchley Park interested me more. By the end of the war ten thousand people were working in and around Bletchley. The great majority of them were women doing vital but repetitive jobs...The ‘need to know’ rule meant that the women knew as much as was necessary to do their jobs, which was very little. As far as I could discover, there were virtually no women in at the centre of the Ultra secret. There was a widely held view at the beginning of the war that women could not keep secrets. I had come to think of Ultra as a microcosm, not only of the war but of a whole society...By having a woman at the centre of the film (I no longer thought of it as a play), I could disguise my own ignorance about Ultra as hers. The idea was to have her move from the outermost ring to the very centre, where she would be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Ian McEwan ''The Imitation Game: Three Plays for Television'', London: Picador, 1982 {{ISBN|0-330-26830-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:MyYearbook Logo with Tag.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The myYearbook logo, which was used from 2005 to 2012.]]

Two high school students, Dave and Catherine Cook, created myYearbook during their [[Spring Break]] of 2005. They persuaded their older brother Geoff, who had founded EssayEdge.com and ResumeEdge.com from his Harvard dorm room, to invest in their project. At the launch of the site, Dave was a junior and Catherine was a sophomore; the project was initially activated at [[Montgomery High School (New Jersey)|Montgomery High School]], in suburban [[New Jersey]] where they attended. The site was created entirely by developers in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/The-secrets-of-a-teens-Internet-success/2100-1038_3-6202845.html|publisher=cnet|date=2007-08-16|title=The secrets of a teen's Internet success|author=Stefanie Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''myYearbook'' partnered with casual game developer ''Arkadium'' to bring Flash based games to the site. The games incorporated Lunch Money, the myYearbook [[virtual economy|virtual currency]]. Lunch Money earned playing games was usable elsewhere on the site.

In April 2009, the site added the [[Meebo]] instant messaging client to the site in order to provide real time chat. In November 2009, ''myYearbook'' launched Chatter, a real-time stream that incorporated media sharing and gaming to help bring members together. Games playable inside the stream included Ask Me, Rate Me and 2 Truths and a Lie. These games incorporated mechanics to help myYearbook members meet each other. By April 2010 the site reported the Chatter feature surpassed one million posts per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myyearbook.com/press/release27/ |title=myYearbook's Chatter Reaches 1 Million Posts Per Day |publisher=Myyearbook.com |date=2010-04-12 |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, ''myYearbook'' rolled out a new site design aimed to appeal to an older demographic. myYearbook chose the final site design by [[crowdsourcing]] its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/01/28/myyearbook-redesign/ | title=MyYearbook Rolls Out Its Crowdsourced Redesign| publisher=[[TechCrunch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, ''myYearbook'' launched an iPhone/iPod Touch and Android application designed to bring the Chatter real time feed to mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id372648912?mt=8 |title=myYearbook: Dating &amp; Fun for Friends and Singles of Any Sex. Start Flirting Now for iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad on the iTunes App Store |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2010-09-07 |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, ''myYearbook'' announced it had agreed to be acquired by Latino social networking site Quepasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2011/07/20/facebook-for-latinos-quepasa-buys-myyearbook-for-100-million-in-cash-and-stock/ | title=MyYearbook bought by Latino social network Quepasa.| publisher=[[TechCrunch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase was finalized on November 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/quepasa-completes-purchase-myyearbook-14929433#.TsVqn3HSpLo |title=Technology and Science News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, ''myYearbook'' launched an iPad app in an attempt to reach the tablet market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/myyearbook-launches-ipad-app-2011-12-19 |date=December 19, 2011 |title=myYearbook Launches iPad App |publisher=Marketwatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the company formed from the combination of myYearbook and Quepasa was renamed MeetMe. This change is because "Yearbook" means more about meeting friends from the past while "MeetMe" would convey the meaning of users making new friends, which is what the website is intended for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myyearbook.com/apps/meetmecomingsoon |date=May 16, 2012 |title=My Yearbook soon to be MeetMe |publisher= myyearbook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebranding of the site proved to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Catherine Cook |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/01/how-to-rebrand-a-social-network-and-live-to-tell-about-it/ |title=How to Rebrand A Social Network And Live To Tell About It |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, MeetMe announced that it would acquire [[Skout]], a global mobile app for meeting new people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2016/06/meetme-to-acquire-skout.html |date=June 26, 2016 |title=MeetMe To Acquire Skout |publisher= OnlinePersonalsWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/news/2016/08/skout-acquisition-puts-meetme-on-a-path-to-100m-annual-revenues-.html |date=August 10, 2016 |title=Skout Acquisition Puts Meetme On A Path To $100M+ Annual Revenues |publisher= OnlinePersonalsWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Skout deal closed in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161004005598/en/MeetMe-Announces-Closing-Skout-Acquisition-Preliminary-Revenue |date=October 4, 2016 |title=MeetMe Announces Closing of Skout Acquisition |publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2017, MeetMe Announces Closing of if(we) Acquisition and Rebrands to The Meet Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meetme-announces-closing-acquisition-rebrands-201500402.html|title=MeetMe Announces Closing of if(we) Acquisition and Rebrands to The Meet Group|last=|first=|date=April 3, 2017|website=|publisher=Business Wire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In September 2017, Meet Group acquired German dating app [https://www.lovoo.com/ Lovoo]&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/20/german-dating-app-lovoo-is-acquired-for-70m-by-the-meet-group/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revenue model==
The Meet Group has transformed its business from being a predominantly advertising model to now generating the majority of revenue from user pay sources, which include subscriptions and in-app purchases for virtual gifts as part of its video live-streaming product. The company also derives revenue from advertising. In the second quarter of 2018, 60% of revenue was derived from user pay, versus 26% in the second quarter of 2017. Livestreaming video revenue has become an increasingly important component of revenue and growth and the product has been rolled out to all of the Company's main apps.

myYearbook derives its revenue from three sources: advertising, virtual-currency sales and monthly subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialtimes.com/2009/08/myyearbook-forgoes-freemium-reports-virtual-goods-success/ |title=myYearbook Forgoes Freemium, Reports Virtual Goods Success|date= 18 August 2009 |publisher=Socialtimes |accessdate=10 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising makes up two-thirds of its revenue, with the other sources making up the rest. It has an established sales office based in New York City and Los Angeles.

In February 2010, myYearbook reported the company ended 2009 with a $20 million run rate.&lt;ref name="revenue"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mashable.com/2010/02/26/myyearbook-revenue | title=myYearbook Revenue at $20 Million Annually and Growing| publisher=[[Mashable]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, myYearbook partnered with [[Viximo]] service to provide better gameplay opportunities for users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/12/16/viximos-game-service-reaches-100m-users-on-dozens-of-smaller-social-networks/ |title=Viximo's game service reaches 100M users on dozens of small social networks |publisher=VentureBeat |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financing==
In 2006, myYearbook raised $4.1 million from [[US Venture Partners]] and [[First Round Capital]]. In 2008, myYearbook raised $13 million in a Series B round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/07/29/teen-social-network-myyearbook-gets-13-million | title=Teen Social Network myYearbook Gets $13 Million| publisher=[[TechCrunch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable incident in the life of the ''Westmorland'' occurred shortly after she sailed for Britain from [[Livorno]] under Captain Michael Wallace late in 1778, carrying a large monetary payment for her inbound cargo of salt cod from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (Livorno was a trade hub for this commodity), food goods,&lt;ref&gt;These included almost 4000 barrels of anchovies, 129 pounds of silk, 150 crates of manna and oil, thirty-four bales of hemp, thirty-two Parmesan cheeses, twenty-two barrels of Tartar salt and medicines and five crates of artificial flowers.&lt;/ref&gt; and 57 crates of artistic objects collected by [[Grand Tour]]ists such as the [[Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh|Duke of Gloucester]], [[Sir John Henderson, 5th Baronet|Sir John Henderson]] and the [[Charles Howard, 10th Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]].&lt;ref&gt;Including Batoni's portrait of Charles Cecil Roberts and a second portrait called An English Gentleman; sculptures by [[Albacini]] and [[Christopher Hewetson]]; a marble chimney originally destined for the Duke of Gloucester; musical scores, violins, violin strings, hats (two barrels), ornamental fans, expensive books; [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] sketches; specimens of lava from [[Mount Vesuvius]] sent by [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]]; relics; paintings by [[Pompeo Batoni]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], [[Carlo Maratta]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Guercino]], among others; modern copies of [[Raphael]]'s paintings; drawings by artists working in Rome, including [[John Robert Cozens]]; 23 crates of ancient Roman marble statues and fragments, plus modern plaster casts; other carved marble mantelpieces, slabs of coloured marble for table-tops, full-sized Piranesi-like "vasi candelabri", 84 rolls of deluxe blank Genoa paper, a crate of flowering onion bulbs and seeds; boxes of pomade, sweetmeats and citrus-blossom water, four barrels of Madeira, and a double-barreled rifle.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1779,&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox. ''The English Prize: The Capture of the Westmorland, An Episode of the Grand Tour.'' New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; she was given chase by four French ships, comprising two men-of-war, the [[French ship Caton (1778)|''Caton'']] (64) and the [[French ship Destin (1778)|''Destin'']] (74), and two smaller vessels.  Wallace attempted to outsail them but, outgunned as he was, soon felt he had little option but to allow the French to board his ship. She was then allowed by Spain (then friendly with France though not yet&amp;nbsp;— in formal terms at least&amp;nbsp;— at war with Britain) to continue to [[Málaga]].

[[File:Mengs, Perseus befreit Andromeda.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Perseus And Andromeda'' by Mengs, another painting captured from the ''Westmorland'' ([[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]])]]
At Málaga her artistic contents were passed on from the French government to two trading companies with links to Ireland, despite Wallace's protests that the ship was full of "extremely precious goods" (the French had already seized her cash cargo), and the Spanish king was informed by his prime minister, the [[Count of Floridablanca]], of the arrival of the art works. Upon Spain's formal declaration of war, king [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] secretly bought the art from a syndicate of Madrid merchants for 360,000 silver [[Spanish real|reales]] (a discount on their original asking price of 600,000 gold [[doubloon]]s, but still a considerable sum) and had it brought by cart to the capital. The portraits of Basset and [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|Lord Lewisham]], meanwhile, were acquired by the Spanish Prime Minister.

Although the British consul at [[Cadiz]] had initially informed the [[British Admiralty]] that the ''Westmorland'' and her cargo had been seized as legitimate [[prize ship|prizes]], demands followed from the British ambassador, firmly backed at cabinet level, for the repatriation of the art and (in a prisoner exchange for French and Spanish prisoners taken by the [[Royal Navy]]) the crew of the ''Westmorland''. Yet to this day, all these coveted artistic treasures remain the possession of the [[Prado Museum]], the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Real Academia]], and other Spanish national collections. There were only a few, very limited exceptions: a package of Catholic relics intended for the Duke of Norfolk (which the Spanish returned unopened to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]); and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn's ''Perseus and Andromeda'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs|Mengs]], which ended up in the collection of [[Catherine the Great]] at the [[Hermitage Museum]].

In 1784, the £100,000 for which the art had been insured at Livorno were paid out in London.  The ''Westmorland'', for its part, was renamed, re-commissioned into the Spanish fleet, but eventually re-taken in the [[Caribbean]] by the British.

In 2012 an exhibition of many of the art works captured was held at the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]] and then traveled to the [[Yale Center for British Art]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|title=Revealed: Grand Tour loot of the Presa Inglesa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/20/grand-tour-loot-presa-inglesa|accessdate=21 November 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vickery|first=Amanda|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/may/04/cargo-culture-grand-tour-unpacked |title=The captured cargo that unpacks the spirit of the grand tour|accessdate=4 August 2017|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sánchez-Jáuregui and Wilcox.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">'''''Who Owns Whom''''' is a set of annual directories published by GAP Books in association with [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]] (D&amp;B).  They provide the relationship between companies worldwide showing who is the ultimate [[parent company]] and who are their [[subsidiaries]].  Details include parent name, address and telephone number, country of incorporation and [[SIC code]] for each ultimate parent company along with the names of the subsidiaries, where they are based, and who owns whom for each subsidiary.  The set of directories are broken down into seven geographic regions: UK &amp; Ireland; West Europe; North Europe; South, Central &amp; East Europe; North &amp; South America; Australasia, Asia, Africa &amp; Middle East.

''Who Owns Whom'' was first published in 1958 by D&amp;B, who still own the rights to the data.  Within the set of ten directories are listed approximately 2,500,000 [[corporate groups]], ranging from companies with hundreds of members across all continents to single-country groups with only a handful of members.

==Criteria for entry==
In order to maintain full coverage, all entries in ''Who Owns Whom'' are published entirely [[free of charge]].  Every effort is made by D&amp;B, who supply the data, to include all corporate groups within the coverage area.  The corporate group may be a vast [[multinational corporation|multinational]] with a range of subsidiaries spanning many different countries and industries, or it may consist of two companies – a parent and a subsidiary.  There is no size criterion for entry.  All corporate groups, which come to the attention of D&amp;B, are included regardless of their [[revenue|sales turnover]] or number of employees.  Companies and organisations are only included if ownership is greater than 50% by other companies or organisations.

==Coverage==
All types of industries are covered, including [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishing]], [[mining]], [[construction]], [[manufacturing]], [[transportation]], [[communication]] and [[public utilities]], [[wholesale]], [[retail]], [[finance]] and [[insurance]], [[public services|services]] and [[public administration]].  Both public and private companies are covered, along with many companies owned by official bodies such as governments, nationalised industries and state holding companies which have subsidiaries, but are not themselves independently registered.
