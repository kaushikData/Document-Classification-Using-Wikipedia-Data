The '''1953 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference''' was the sixth [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference|Meeting]] of the [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It was held in the [[United Kingdom]] in June 1953 on the occasion of the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]], and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Sir [[Winston Churchill]].

The meeting was held prior to a Three Powers conference between Churchill, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Joseph Laniel]] in [[Bermuda]] which Commonwealth leaders hoped would lead to a Four Powers summit with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wdIwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oN0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4656,2191080&amp;dq=commonwealth+prime+ministers|title=Ottawa Citizen - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice talks]] to conclude the [[Korean War]] were also discussed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vciLoneE8GYC|title=The Commonwealth at the Summit: Communiqués of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, 1944-1986|last=Secretariat|first=Commonwealth|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|isbn=9780850923179|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the security of the [[Suez Canal]] and the importance of maintaining British military installations were also discussed (see [[Suez War]]) as were the economic situation and the objectives for development and strengthening of the [[Pound sterling]] area set out at the [[1952 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Economic Conference]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Andries Teeuw''' (12 August 1921&amp;nbsp;– 18 May 2012), better known as '''A. Teeuw''' in scholarly circles and '''Hans Teeuw''' to his friends, was a Dutch critic of [[Indonesian literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/05/23/in-memoriam-hans-teeuw-ever-a-student-indonesia.html |title=In Memoriam : Hans Teeuw: Ever a student of Indonesia |publisher=The Jakarta Post |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitlv.nl/home/Spotlight?subpage_id=442 |title=Hans Teeuw (1921-2012) |publisher=KITLV |date= |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819180755/http://www.kitlv.nl/home/Spotlight?subpage_id=442 |archivedate=19 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Teeuw was born in [[Gorinchem]], [[Netherlands]], on 12 August 1921.{{sfn|Eneste|2001|pp=39-40}}

Teeuw conducted a field study of Indonesian literature in [[Yogyakarta]] between 1945 and 1947.{{sfn|Eneste|2001|pp=39-40}} While in Yogyakarta, he worked on translating the ''Bhomakhawya'', described as one of the most difficult [[kakawin]]s. Teeuw was unable to complete the translation, noting that some parts were guesswork and other [[canto]]s were indecipherable.{{sfn|Supomo|2001|pp=127-128}} In 1946 he graduated with a doctorate in literature from [[Utrecht University]], using his translation as the basis for his dissertation. In 1950 he took a position as lecturer of Malay literature at the [[University of Indonesia]], a position which he held until 1951.{{sfn|Eneste|2001|pp=39-40}} It is while at the University of Indonesia that he published his first book on Indonesian literature, entitled ''Voltooid Voorspel''. The work was later expanded and translated to Indonesian, then published under the title ''Pokok dan Tokoh'' (''Tenets and Figures'') in 1952; it was expanded again for a revised edition in 1955.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=1}}  Four years later, he took a position as Lecturer on Indonesian and Malay Language and Literature at the [[Leiden University]].{{sfn|Eneste|2001|pp=39-40}}

From 1962 until 1963, Teeuw held a position as guest lecturer at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States.{{sfn|Eneste|2001|pp=39-40}} In 1967 he published the two volume ''Modern Indonesian Literature'', which has since been reprinted several times.{{sfn|Damono 1983, Tujuh Kritik Teeuw}} The work was initially meant to be an English translation of ''Pokok dan Tokoh'', but Teeuw found his earlier book out of date.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=1}} He became head of the Department of Language and Culture at Leiden University in 1968, a position which he held until 1986.{{sfn|Eneste|2001|pp=39-40}} While in this position, Teeuw, [[Petrus Josephus Zoetmulder]], P. Galestin, Stuart Robson, and Peter Worsley translated the kakawin ''Siwaratrikalpa''; featuring notes and historical background, the translation was published as the first installment of the Bibliotheca Indonesica series, published by the [[Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies]].{{sfn|Supomo|2001|p=113}} He received an [[honorary doctorate]] from the [[University of Indonesia]] in 1975;{{sfn|Eneste|2001|pp=39-40}} that same year he established the Indonesian Studies Programme, which serves to coordinate studies in the [[humanities]] between Indonesia and the Netherlands.{{sfn|van der Meij 1994, Professor Teeuw Award}}

==Views==
According to Indonesian writer [[Sapardi Djoko Damono]], Teeuw's analyses of Indonesian literature always include the influence of the author's background; he notes that Teeuw's analysis of [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]]'s work included an in-depth biography of the novelist. He borrowed elements of [[linguistics]] in his 1980 work ''Tergantung Pada Kata'' (''Hanging on Words''), an analysis of Indonesian poetry.{{sfn|Damono 1983, Tujuh Kritik Teeuw}}

In ''History of Modern Indonesian Literature'', Teeuw wrote that modern Indonesian literature began in 1920, with the [[Indonesian National Awakening]]. He argued that Indonesian literature, despite the country only [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|becoming independent]] on 17 August 1945, was born with the concept of a united Indonesia. Teeuw further divided Indonesian literature into two periods: before independence and after independence.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|pp=15-16}}

Teeuw described [[Marah Roesli]]'s ''[[Sitti Nurbaya]]'' (1923) as the first true Indonesian novel, as the earlier ''[[Azab dan Sengsara]]'' (''Pain and Suffering''; 1920) by [[Merari Siregar]] was less developed.{{sfn|Balfas|1976|p=52}} He wrote that ''Sitti Nurbaya'', [[Abdul Muis]]' ''[[Salah Asuhan]]'' (''Wrong Upbringing''; 1928), and [[Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana]]'s ''[[Layar Terkembang]]'' (''With Sails Unfurled''; 1936) were the most important [[Indonesian National Revolution|pre-war]] novels.{{sfn|Teeuw|1980|p=93}}

==Legacy==
In 1992, the Professor Teeuw Foundation established the Professor Teeuw Award, a biannual award which is rewarded to Indonesian and Dutch persons who further academic relations between the two countries. The first award was to Indonesian journalist [[Goenawan Mohamad]], while the second was to Harry Poeze, chief editor of [[KITLV Press]].{{sfn|van der Meij 1994, Professor Teeuw Award}}

==Personal life==
By 1974, Teeuw had been married for twenty-nine years and has five children. The family often received Indonesian guests and prepared [[Indonesian cuisine]].{{sfn|Tempo 1974, A. Teeuw Menjadi}}

'''''Afro-Americans in New York Life and History''''' is an [[academic journal]] organized and distributed by [[Buffalo, New York]]'s Afro-American Historical Association of the Niagara Frontier.

==History and background==
Founded in 1977, the journal's mission statement informs readers that its purpose is "to publish analytical, historical, and descriptive articles dealing with the life and history of Afro-Americans in New York State."&lt;ref&gt;Mission/Purpose Statement, {{cite web|url=http://www.aahanf.org/aanylh.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813115828/http://aahanf.org/aanylh.htm |archivedate=2013-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles are featured that deal with methodology and trends in local and regional African-American studies, historically and currently. Additionally, documents are frequently published that have historical significance to the African-American in the state of New York, specifically. Finally, book reviews are published pertaining to aspects of the life, history, and culture of people of African descent and race relations.&lt;ref&gt;Afro-Americans in New York Life and History&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the journal's first publication, the success of [[Alex Haley]]'s novel ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]'' (1976) had created an immense, new found interest in the African-American community for the discovery, preservation, and presentation of the often-overlooked rich cultural heritage that African Americans had established in the United States.

==Relevance==
The plight of African Americans in the United States in the 20th and 21st centuries can be connected to many different issues.  The barriers of racism, economics and politics have greatly contributed to the oppression of people of color. These barriers continue to do so today. Whether purposefully or unknowingly actions in today's world due to these have left scars on society that have yet to heal. ''Afro-Americans in New York Life and History'' has played an important role in merging academic and community perspectives of African-American history and culture.

==Editors and Board of Directors==
As of July 2013, Seneca Vaught, professor of history and African Studies at [[Kennesaw State University]], is the journal's Editor, aided by Associate Editors Clarence Williams of [[CUNY]], Lillian Williams of [[SUNY at Buffalo]], and Oscar R. Williams of [[SUNY at Albany]]. A variety of scholars who are interested in furthering the field of African-American history serve as Contributing Editors.

In addition to Editorial supervision, the twenty-three member Board of Directors that oversees the Afro-American Historical Association of the Niagara Frontier also has input into the operation and contents of the journal.&lt;ref&gt;"Board of Directors and Editorial Board," ''Afro-Americans in New York Life and History'', Vol. 37 No. 2 (July 2013), p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable issues==
The issues concerning this journal are aimed towards African Americans in New York, with prevalent issues brought to light and discussed in the volumes of ''Afro-Americans in New York Life and History''. 
In 2005, the New York Historical Society held an exhibition titled ''Slavery in New York''. An issue regarding ''Slavery in Albany, New York'' by Oscar Williams, Vol. 34, No. 2 (July 2010) emphasized that slavery was not limited to the south. In 1991, human remains by construction workers in lower Manhattan raised awareness of the African Burial Ground, where slaves in New York City were buried. Slavery was practiced into the 19th century. Most studies on slavery in New York have mentioned other New York cities sparingly. There is a failure on an understanding that slavery was widespread throughout New York. The capital, Albany, houses a special relationship of slavery beginning with the establishment of the Dutch West India Company in 1621.

Another issue arose in regards to African-American prisoners as passive citizens. Themis Chronopoulos' article "Political Power and Passive Citizenship: The Implications of Considering African American Prisoners as Residents of Rural New York State Districts" explains how African-American prisoners who used to live in New York City were transferred to a rural prison, which has had critical political implications. This movement of prisoners has allowed more conservative legislators to hold a political office. State law dictates that prisoners have no rights but are still being accounted for in the population. Consequently, these conservative legislators have been generally hostile in regards to African Americans and their interest. If it was not for the urban population of upstate New York, numerous senate districts would have to be redrawn due to a lack of number of residents. The Republican Party would not be able to dominate the New York State Senate and downstate New York would be more politically powerful.&lt;ref&gt;"Political Power and Passive Citizenship: The Implications of Considering African American Prisoners as Residents of Rural New York State Districts," ''Afro-Americans in New York Life and History'', Vol. 34, No. 2 (July 2010), pp. 7-33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Slavery in Albany, New York," ''Afro-Americans in New York Life and History'', Vol. 34, No. 2 (July 2010), pp. 154-166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==
The Carter G. Woodson essay contest is a scholarship awarded to students, ranging from grades 4-12, that show significant ability in writing. These essays are themed and students must be a resident from the western New York area. Cash prizes and certificates are presented to the winner. The winners' essays will be published in ''Historically Speaking'' and read at the African American History Program.

The emergence of modern Armenian studies is associated with the foundation of the Catholic [[Mechitarists|Mechitarist order]] in the early 18th century. Until the early 20th century, Armenian studies were largely conducted by individual scholars in the Armenian communities of the Russian Empire (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, [[Nakhichevan-on-Don|New Nakhichevan]], [[Tiflis]]), Europe ([[Venice]], Vienna, Paris, London, Berlin, Leipzig), [[Constantinople]] and [[Vagharshapat]] in Armenia. After the establishment of Soviet rule, Armenian studies, and sciences in general, were institutionalized in Armenia and put under direct control of the [[Armenian National Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Soviet Armenian Encyclopedia]] Volume 6|chapter=Հայագիտություն|date=1980|pages=[https://hy.wikisource.org/wiki/%D4%B7%D5%BB:%D5%80%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B6_%D5%8D%D5%B8%D5%BE%D5%A5%D5%BF%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B6_%D5%80%D5%A1%D5%B6%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%A3%D5%AB%D5%BF%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%B6_(Soviet_Armenian_Encyclopedia)_6.djvu/130 130–133]|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, numerous publications, research centers specializing in Armenian studies exist in many parts of the world.

'''Arvo Pärt''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈɑrvo ˈpært|est}}; born 11 September 1935) is an [[Estonia]]n composer of [[classical music|classical]] and [[religious music]]. Since the late 1970s, Pärt has worked in a [[Minimal music|minimalist]] style that employs his self-invented compositional technique, [[tintinnabuli]]. Pärt's music is in part inspired by [[Gregorian chant]]. His most performed works include ''[[Fratres]]'' (1977), ''[[Spiegel im Spiegel]]'' (1978), and ''[[Für Alina]]'' (1976). Since 2011 Pärt has been the most performed living composer in the world.

== Life ==
Pärt was born in [[Paide]], [[Järva County]], Estonia and was raised by his mother and stepfather in [[Rakvere]] in northern Estonia.&lt;ref name=estonianworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estonianworld.com/culture/sounds-emanating-love-story-arvo-part/|title=Sounds emanating love – the story of Arvo Pärt|date=11 September 2015|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began to experiment with the top and bottom notes of the family's piano as the middle register was damaged.&lt;ref name="sinfinimusic"&gt;[http://sinfinimusic.com/uk/learn/composers/arvo-paert Arvo Pärt], Sinfini Music website&lt;/ref&gt; Pärt's musical education began at the age of seven when he began attending music school in Rakvere. By the time he reached his early teenage years, Pärt was writing his own compositions. His first serious study came in 1954 at the Tallinn Music Middle School, but less than a year later he temporarily abandoned it to fulfill military service, playing [[oboe]] and percussion in the army band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/arvo-p%C3%A4rt-mn0000929776/biography|title=Arvo Pärt – Biography &amp; History|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his service he attended the [[Tallinn Conservatory]], where he studied composition with [[Heino Eller]]&lt;ref name="playbill"&gt;New York City Ballet program notes in ''Playbill,'' January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was said of him, "he just seemed to shake his sleeves and the notes would fall out".&lt;ref&gt;P. Hillier, ''Arvo Pärt'', 1997, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, he produced music for film and the stage. During the 1950s, he also completed his first vocal composition, the [[cantata]] ''Meie aed'' ('Our Garden') for children's choir and orchestra. He graduated in 1963. From 1957 to 1967, he worked as a sound producer for the Estonian public radio broadcaster [[Eesti Rahvusringhääling]].

Pärt was criticized by [[Tikhon Khrennikov]] in 1962, for employing [[serialism]] in ''Nekrolog'' (1960), the first 12-tone music written in Estonia,&lt;ref name=Allison/&gt; which exhibited his "susceptibility to foreign influences". But nine months later he won First Prize in a competition of 1,200 works, awarded by the all-''Union Society of Composers'', indicating the inability of the Soviet regime to agree consistently on what was permissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Misiunas |first1=Romuald J.|last2=Rein |first2=Taagepera |year=1983 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJejwedGesMC&amp;lpg=PA170 |title=The Baltic States, Years of Dependence, 1940–1980 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-04625-0 |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, Pärt studied [[Medieval music|medieval]] and [[Renaissance music]] instead of focusing on his own composition. About this same time, he converted from [[Lutheranism]] to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Peter Quinn. [http://www.classical-music.com/topic/arvo-p%C3%A4rt Arvo Pärt], ''BBC Music Magazine'', the official website of BBC Music Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, after a prolonged struggle with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] officials, he was allowed to emigrate with his wife and their two sons. He lived first in [[Vienna]], where he took Austrian citizenship and then relocated to [[Berlin]], Germany, in 1981. He returned to Estonia around the turn of the 21st century and for a while lived alternately in Berlin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swr.de/swr2/.../swr2-musikstunde-20110427.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823164619/https://www.swr.de/swr2/.../swr2-musikstunde-20110427.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 August 2017 |title=Radio :: SWR2 – SWR.de |work=swr.online |accessdate=25 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref name = "playbill"/&gt; He currently resides in [[Laulasmaa]], about {{convert|35|km}} from Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/19/arvo-part-the-symphonies-review-epic-journey-from-modernism-to-melodicism |title=Arvo Pärt: The Symphonies review – the Parts that make the whole |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |first=Andrew |last=Clements |date=19 April 2018 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks fluent German and has German citizenship as a result of living in Germany since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;P. Hillier, ''Arvo Pärt'', 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/arvo-p%C3%A4rt-special-1-how-sacred-music-scooped-interview |title=Arvo Pärt Special 1: How Sacred Music Scooped an Interview|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Bohlman, ''The Music of European Nationalism: Cultural Identity and Modern History'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described Pärt as possibly "the world's greatest living composer" and "by a long way, Estonia's most celebrated export". But when asked how Estonian he felt his music to be, Pärt replied: "I don’t know what is Estonian... I don’t think about these things."  Unlike many of his fellow Estonian composers, Pärt never found inspiration in the country's epic poem, ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'', even in his early works. Pärt said "My Kalevipoeg is Jesus Christ."&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/classicalmusic/11273603/Arvo-Part-interview-music-says-what-I-need-to-say.html |first=John |last=Allison |title=Arvo Pärt interview: 'music says what I need to say'|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=12 December 2014|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musical development ==
Familiar works by Pärt are ''[[Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten]]'' for [[string orchestra]] and bell (1977) and the [[string quintet]] ''[[Fratres]] I'' (1977, revised 1983), which he transcribed for string orchestra and percussion, the solo violin "Fratres II" and the cello ensemble "Fratres III" (both 1980).

Pärt is often identified with the school of [[Minimalist music|minimalism]] and, more specifically, that of mystic minimalism or [[holy minimalism]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, in an essay by Christopher Norris called "Post-modernism: a guide for the perplexed," found in Gary K. Browning, Abigail Halcli, Frank Webster, ''Understanding Contemporary Society: Theories of the Present'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered a pioneer of the latter style, along with contemporaries [[Henryk Górecki]] and [[John Tavener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Adrian |authorlink=Adrian Thomas (composer) |title=Górecki |location=Oxford |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K81gRix2VAAC&amp;lpg=PA135 |publisher=Clarendon Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-19-816393-2 |page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although his fame initially rested on instrumental works such as ''[[Tabula Rasa (Pärt)|Tabula Rasa]]'' and ''[[Spiegel im Spiegel]]'', his [[choral]] works have also come to be widely appreciated.

In this period of Estonian history, Pärt was unable to encounter many musical influences from outside the Soviet Union except for a few illegal tapes and scores. Although Estonia had been an independent state at the time of Pärt's birth, the [[Soviet occupation of Estonia|Soviet Union occupied it in 1940]] as a result of the Soviet–[[Nazis|Nazi]] [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]; and the country would then remain under Soviet domination—except for the three-year period of German wartime occupation—for the next 51 years.

=== Compositions ===
[[File:Arvo Pärt, 2011.jpg|thumb|Pärt at the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Estonian Foreign Ministry]] in 2011]]
{{Main|List of compositions by Arvo Pärt}}
Pärt's works are generally divided into two periods. He composed his early works using a range of [[Neoclassicism (music)|neo-classical]] styles influenced by [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]], and [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]]. He then began to compose using [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg's]] [[twelve-tone technique]] and serialism. This, however, not only earned the ire of the Soviet establishment but also proved to be a creative dead-end. When early works were banned by Soviet censors, Pärt entered the first of several periods of contemplative silence, during which he studied choral music from the 14th to 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="playbill" /&gt; In this context, Pärt's biographer, [[Paul Hillier]], observed that "he had reached a position of complete despair in which the composition of music appeared to be the most futile of gestures, and he lacked the musical faith and willpower to write even a single note."&lt;ref&gt;P. Hillier, ''Arvo Pärt'', 1997, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spirit of [[early European Polyphony]] informed the composition of Pärt's transitional Third Symphony (1971); thereafter he immersed himself in early music, reinvestigating the roots of Western music. He studied [[plainsong]], [[Gregorian chant]] and the emergence of [[polyphony]] in the European [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]].

The music that began to emerge after this period was radically different. This period of new compositions included the 1977 works ''Fratres'', ''Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten'' and ''Tabula Rasa''.&lt;ref name="playbill" /&gt; Pärt describes the music of this period as tintinnabuli—like the ringing of bells. ''Spiegel im Spiegel'' (1978) is a well-known example which has been used in many films. The music is characterised by simple [[harmony|harmonies]], often single unadorned notes, or [[Chord (music)|triads]], which form the basis of Western harmony. These are reminiscent of ringing bells. Tintinnabuli works are rhythmically simple and do not change tempo. Another characteristic of Pärt's later works is that they are frequently settings for sacred texts, although he mostly chooses [[Latin]] or the [[Church Slavonic language]] used in Orthodox liturgy instead of his native [[Estonian language]]. Large-scale works inspired by religious texts include ''[[Passio (Pärt)|St. John Passion]]'', ''[[Te Deum (Pärt)|Te Deum]]'', and ''Litany''. Choral works from this period include [[Magnificat (Pärt)|''Magnificat'']] and ''The Beatitudes''.&lt;ref name="playbill" /&gt;

Pärt has been the most performed living composer in the world for seven consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.universaledition.com/blog/detail/sCategory/562/blogArticle/3568|title=7th year running: Arvo Pärt is the world’s most performed contemporary composer |publisher=universaledition.com |date=10 January 2018 |accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of Pärt's popularity, [[Steve Reich]] has written: "Even in Estonia, Arvo was getting the same feeling that we were all getting&amp;nbsp;... I love his music, and I love the fact that he is such a brave, talented man&amp;nbsp;... He's completely out of step with the [[zeitgeist]] and yet he's enormously popular, which is so inspiring. His music fulfills a deep human need that has nothing to do with fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Hodgkinson, Will. [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jan/02/1 "The Reich stuff"]. ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 January 2004. Retrieved, 18 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Pärt's music came to public attention in the West largely thanks to [[Manfred Eicher]] who recorded several of Pärt's compositions for [[ECM Records]] starting in 1984. Pärt wrote ''[[Cecilia, vergine romana]]'' on an Italian text about life and martyrdom of [[Saint Cecilia]], the [[patron saint]] of music, for choir and orchestra on a commission for the [[Great Jubilee]] in Rome, where it was performed, close to her feast day on 22 November, by the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]] conducted by [[Myung-whun Chung]]. 

Invited by [[Walter Fink]], Pärt was the 15th composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenporträt]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]] in 2005 in four concerts. Chamber music included ''Für Alina'' for piano, played by himself, ''Spiegel im Spiegel'' and ''Psalom'' for string quartet. The chamber orchestra of the [[Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra]] played his ''Trisagion'', ''Fratres'' and ''Cantus'' along with works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]. The [[Windsbach Boys Choir]] and soloists [[Sibylla Rubens]], [[Ingeborg Danz]], [[Markus Schäfer]] and [[Klaus Mertens]] performed ''Magnificat'' and ''Collage über B-A-C-H'' together with two [[Church cantatas (Bach)|Bach cantatas]] and one by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. The [[Hilliard Ensemble]], organist [[Christopher Bowers-Broadbent]], the [[Rostock Motet Choir]] and the Hilliard instrumental ensemble, conducted by {{ill|Markus Johannes Langer|de}}, performed a program of Pärt's organ music and works for voices (some ''a cappella''), including ''[[Pari intervallo]]'', [[De profundis (Pärt)|De profundis]], and [[Miserere (Pärt)|Miserere]].

A new composition, ''Für Lennart'', written for the memory of the Estonian President, [[Lennart Meri]], was played at Meri's funeral service on 2 April 2006.

In response to the murder of the Russian [[investigative journalism|investigative journalist]] [[Anna Politkovskaya]] in Moscow on 7 October 2006, Pärt declared that all of his works performed in 2006 and 2007 would be in honour of her death, issuing the following statement: "Anna Politkovskaya staked her entire talent, energy and—in the end—even her life on saving people who had become victims of the abuses prevailing in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007 |title=Arvo Pärt commemorates Politkovskaja |journal=Universal Edition Newsletter |issue=Winter 2006/2007 |page=13 |publisher=Universal Edition|url=http://www.universaledition.com/tl_files/News_Dateien/Newsletter_pdf/2007_01_en.pdf |accessdate=19 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arvo Pärt ja Nora Pärt.jpg|thumb|Pärt with his wife Nora in 2012]]
Pärt was honoured as the featured composer of the 2008 [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] Living Music Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.rte.ie/about/en/press-office/press-releases/2008/0218/292412-performinggroupsfeb182008/ |title=Arvo Pärt describes RTÉ Living Music Festival as 'best festival of my life' |publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Dublin, Ireland. He was also commissioned by Louth Contemporary Music Society&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louthcms.org/projects/baltic-voices-ireland-arvo-parts-world-premiere/|title=Baltic Voices in Ireland: Arvo Pärt’s World Premiere – Louth Contemporary Music Society|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to compose a new choral work based on "[[Saint Patrick's Breastplate]]", which premiered in 2008 in [[Louth, County Louth|Louth]], Ireland. The new work, ''The Deer's Cry'', is his first Irish commission, and received its debut in [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://emic.ee/premiere-of--the-deers-cry--by-arvo-part-in-ireland|title=Music News – Estonian Music Information Centre|first=Art Media Agency OÜ,|last=http://www.artmedia.ee|website=emic.ee|accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pärt's 2008 Fourth Symphony is named ''Los Angeles'' and was dedicated to [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]. It was Pärt's first symphony written since his Third Symphony of 1971. It premiered in [[Los Angeles]], California, at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] on 10 January 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120905093502/http://www.laphil.com/music/piece_detail.cfm?id=2711 In Detail: Arvo Pärt's Symphony No. 4 'Los Angeles'].

On 10 December 2011, Pärt was appointed a member of the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]] for a five-year renewable term by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/28516.php?index=28516&amp;lang=en NOMINA DI MEMBRI DEL PONTIFICIO CONSIGLIO DELLA CULTURA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107142020/http://press.catholica.va/news_services/bulletin/news/28516.php?index=28516&amp;lang=en |date=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2014, Tõnu Kaljuste, conducting the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, the Sinfonietta Riga, the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra, the Latvian Radio Choir and the Vox Clamantis ensemble, won a Grammy for Best Choral Performance for a performance of Pärt's ''[[Adam's Lament (Pärt)|Adam's Lament]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://estonianworld.com/culture/arvo-parts-adams-lament-wins-grammy-award-in-the-best-choral-performance-category/ Arvo Pärt’s “Adam’s Lament” wins Grammy Award in the Best Choral Performance category!]. Retrieved 26 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pärt has credited his second wife Nora, a trained [[musicology|musicologist]], with helping him to find his identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interlude.hk/front/art-deal-eternal-questionsarvo-nora-part/|title="Art has to deal with eternal Questions"Arvo and Nora Pärt  : Interlude.hk|website=interlude.hk|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International centre ==

The [[Arvo Pärt Centre]] is located in the Estonian village of [[Laulasmaa]], a coastal village located some {{convert|35|km}} west of Tallinn. The centre is responsible for maintaining the composer's archive. In August 2018 Estonian [[Ministry of Culture (Estonia)|Minister of Culture]] [[Indrek Saar]] invited representatives of the Ministries of Culture of eight countries to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the new centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.err.ee/852103/minister-invites-foreign-representatives-to-opening-of-arvo-part-centre|title=Minister invites foreign representatives to opening of Arvo Pärt Centre|first=|last=ERR|date=7 August 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new building of the centre, which opened to visitors on 17 October 2018, includes in addition to the archives a library, a museum, research facilities, an education centre, and a concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arvopart.ee/en/|title=Arvo Pärt Centre|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.arvopart.ee/en/arvo-part-centre/about-the-centre/|title=About the Centre – Arvo Pärt Centre|website=www.arvopart.ee|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brandenburg Gate''' ({{lang-de|Brandenburger Tor}}; {{IPA-de|ˈbʁandn̩bʊɐ̯gɐ ˈtoːɐ̯|}}) is an 18th-century [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] monument in [[Berlin]], built on the orders of [[Prussia]]n king [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] after the (temporarily) successful restoration of order during the early [[Batavian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/friedens-statt-triumph-symbol-das-brandenburger-tor-und-sein-geheimnis/10858278.html Das Brandenburger Tor und sein Geheimnis],
''Der Tagesspiegel''&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best-known landmarks of [[Germany]], it was built on the site of a former [[city gate]] that marked the start of the road from Berlin to the town of [[Brandenburg an der Havel]], which used to be capital of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].

It is located in the western part of the city centre of Berlin within [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]], at the junction of [[Unter den Linden]] and [[Ebertstraße]], immediately west of the [[Pariser Platz]]. One block to the north stands the [[Reichstag building]], which houses the German parliament (''[[Bundestag]]''). The gate is the monumental entry to Unter den Linden, the renowned boulevard of [[Tilia|linden]] trees, which led directly to the royal [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]] of the [[Prussia]]n monarchs.

Throughout its existence, the Brandenburg Gate was often a site for major historical events and is today considered not only as a symbol of the tumultuous history of Europe and Germany, but also of European [[European integration|unity]] and [[Long Peace|peace]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2014}}

=== Design and construction ===
[[Image:ZLB-Berliner Ansichten-Januar.jpg|thumb|right|Berlin in 1688:  The future site of the Brandenburg gate was near the middle left of the map, separating the [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]] from [[Unter den Linden]].  Travellers going west from the city toward [[Brandenburg an der Havel]] could pass in this direction]]
&lt;!--- {{Location map|Germany Berlin|label=Brandenburg Gate| lat_deg=52 | lat_min=30 | lat_sec=59| lon_deg=13 | lon_min=22 |lon_sec=40|position=right|float=right|caption=Location in modern Berlin}} ---&gt;
In the time of [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William]] (1688), shortly after the [[Thirty Years' War]] and a century before the gate was constructed, Berlin was a small walled city within a [[star fort]] with several named gates: [[Spandau]]er Tor, St. Georgen Tor, Stralower Tor, [[Köpenick|Cöpenicker]] Tor, Neues Tor, and [[Leipzig]]er Tor ''(see map)''.  Relative peace, a policy of religious tolerance, and status as capital of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] facilitated the growth of the city.

[[File:Karte berlin akzisemauer.png|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Customs Wall]] with its 18 gates]]
The Brandenburg Gate was not part of the old [[Berlin Fortress]], but one of 18 gates within the [[Berlin Customs Wall]] ({{lang-de|[[:de:Akzisemauer|Akzisemauer]]}}), erected in the 1730s, including the old fortified city and many of its then suburbs.

The new gate was commissioned by [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] to represent peace. The Gate was designed by [[Carl Gotthard Langhans]], the Court Superintendent of Buildings, and built between 1788 and 1791, replacing the earlier simple guardhouses which flanked the original gate in the Customs Wall. The gate consists of twelve [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, six to each side, forming five passageways. Citizens originally were allowed to use only the outermost two on each side. Atop the gate is a [[Quadriga]], a chariot drawn by four horses,  sculpted by [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]].  The new gate was originally named the Peace Gate (German: ''Friedenstor'')&lt;ref name=DenkmalBT&gt;{{cite web|title=Denkmale in Berlin. Brandenburger Tor|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl?DOK_TPL=lda_doc.tpl&amp;KEY=obj%2009065019|publisher=Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Umwelt, Berlin|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the goddess is [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]], the goddess of victory.

The gate's design is based upon the [[Propylaea]], the gateway to the [[Acropolis]] in [[Athens]], Greece, and is consistent with Berlin's history of architectural [[classicism]] (first, [[Baroque]], and then [[neo-Palladian]]). The gate was the first element of "Athens on the River Spree" by architect Langhans.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

=== 19th and early 20th centuries ===

The Brandenburg Gate has played different political roles in German history. After the 1806 Prussian defeat at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], [[Napoleon]] was the first to use the Brandenburg Gate for a triumphal procession,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/ausstellungen/staendige-ausstellung/1789-1871/objekt_en.html#objekt11 |title=Deutsches Historisches Museum |publisher=Dhm.de |date= |accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took its Quadriga to Paris.&lt;ref name="world and its people"&gt;{{cite book

  |authorlink = 
  |title = The World and Its People
  |publisher = Silver, Burdett
  |series = 
  |year = 1742
  |page = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Napoleon's defeat in 1814 and the Prussian occupation of Paris by General [[Ernst von Pfuel]], the Quadriga was restored to Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sullivan |first1=Paul |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LnSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;dq=brandenburg+gate+von+pfuel&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj67cK37cvMAhUDOBQKHZ-BBG8Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=brandenburg%20gate%20von%20pfuel&amp;f=false |title=Pocket Rough Guide Berlin |chapter=Brandenburg Gate |work=[[Rough Guides]] |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Random House]] |year=2016 |page=72 |accessdate=2016-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was now redesigned by [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] for the new role of the Brandenburg Gate as a Prussian triumphal arch; the goddess, now definitely Victoria, was equipped with the Prussian eagle and [[Iron Cross]] on her lance with a wreath of oak leaves.&lt;ref name=DenkmalBT /&gt;

The Quadriga faces east, as it did when it was originally installed in 1793. Only the royal family was allowed to pass through the central archway,&lt;ref name="world and its people"/&gt; as well as members of the [[Pfuel]] family, from 1814 to 1919.&lt;ref name="Google Books 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Berlin Feuerland | website=Google Books | date=2016-07-28 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foq7BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT104&amp;dq=von+pfuel+quadriga&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiSiq6BkbjOAhXC1BoKHZ2VDkwQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=von%20pfuel%20quadriga&amp;f=false | language=de | accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DW.COM 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=225 Jahre Brandenburger Tor | website=DW.COM | date=2016-08-04 | url=http://www.dw.com/de/225-jahre-brandenburger-tor/a-19443479 | language= | accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kaiser granted this honour to the family in gratitude to Ernst von Pfuel, who had overseen the return of the Quadriga to the top of the gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dedio |first1=Florian |last2=Dedio |first2=Gunnar |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVyEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=brandenburg+gate+von+pfuel&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEnaiW0MXMAhXD1xQKHYF6AhIQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=brandenburg%20gate%20von%20pfuel&amp;f=false |title=The Great War Diaries: Breathtaking Colour Photographs from a World Torn Apart |chapter=[[Berlin]], Germany, before the war |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[BBC Books]], [[Penguin Random House]] |year=2013 |page=50 |accessdate=2016-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the central archway was also used by the coaches of ambassadors on the single occasion of their presenting their [[Diplomatic correspondence#Letters of credence|letters of credence]] to council.

[[File:Allies at the Brandenburg Gate, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bernard Montgomery]] and Soviet Marshals [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]] and [[Konstantin Rokossovsky|Rokossovsky]] leave the Brandenburg Gate on 12 July 1945 after being decorated by Montgomery]]

When the [[Nazis]] ascended to power, they used the gate as a party symbol. The gate survived World War II and was one of the damaged structures still standing in the Pariser Platz ruins in 1945 (another being the Academy of Fine Arts). The gate was badly damaged with holes in the columns from bullets and nearby explosions.  One horse's head from the original quadriga survived, and is today kept in the collection of the [[Märkisches Museum]].

=== Cold War ===

Following Germany's surrender and the end of the war, the governments of [[East Berlin]] and [[West Berlin]] restored it in a joint effort. The holes were patched, but were visible for many years following the war.

Vehicles and pedestrians could travel freely through the gate, located in East Berlin, until the [[Berlin Wall]] was built, 13 August 1961. Brandenburg Gate border crossing was later closed on 14 August 1961. West Berliners gathered on the western side of the gate to demonstrate against the Berlin Wall, among them West Berlin's governing Mayor [[Willy Brandt]], who had spontaneously returned from a federal election campaigning tour in West Germany earlier on the same day. It was closed throughout the [[Berlin Wall]] period until 22 December 1989.

===  Post-1989 ===

[[File:Crane removed part of Wall Brandenburg Gate.jpg|thumb|A crane removes a section of the [[Berlin Wall]] near Brandenburg Gate on 21 December 1989]]

When the [[Revolutions of 1989]] occurred and the wall was demolished, the gate symbolized freedom and the desire to unify the city of Berlin. Thousands of people gathered at the wall to celebrate its fall on 9 November 1989. On 22 December 1989, the Brandenburg Gate border crossing was reopened when [[Helmut Kohl]], the West German chancellor, walked through to be greeted by [[Hans Modrow]], the East German prime minister. Demolition of the rest of the wall around the area took place the following year.

During 1990, the quadriga was removed from the gate as part of renovation work carried out by the East German authorities following the fall of the wall in November 1989. Germany was officially reunified in October 1990.

The Brandenburg Gate was privately refurbished on 21 December 2000, at a cost of six million euros. It was once again opened on 3 October 2002 following extensive refurbishment, for the 12th anniversary of [[German reunification]].

Brandenburg Gate became the main venue for the 20th-anniversary celebrations of the fall of the Berlin Wall or "Festival of Freedom" on the evening of 9 November 2009. The high point of the celebrations was when over 1000 colorfully designed foam domino tiles, each over {{convert|2.5|m}} tall, were lined up along the route of the former wall through the city centre. The domino "wall" was then toppled in stages converging here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mauerfall09.de|title=20 Jahre Mauerfall|accessdate=9 April 2009 | year=2009| publisher=Kulturprojekte Berlin GmbH|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brandenburg Gate is now again closed to vehicle traffic, and much of Pariser Platz has been turned into a [[cobblestone]] [[pedestrian zone]]. The gate, along with the broad ''[[Straße des 17. Juni]]'' avenue to the west, is also one of the large public areas in Berlin where over a million people can gather to watch stage shows or party together, watch major sport events shown on huge screens, or see fireworks at midnight on New Year's Eve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.morgenpost.de/berlin-aktuell/article112322858/Berlin-feiert-am-Brandenburger-Tor-ins-neue-Jahr-2013.html |title=Berlin feiert am Brandenburger Tor ins neue Jahr 2013 (in German) |publisher=Berliner Morgenpost |date=4 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After winning the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the [[German national football team]] held their victory rally in front of the gate.

It has also hosted street events at [[2009 IAAF World Championships in Athletics]] and will repeat its
role in [[2018 European Athletics Championships]]. It is also the usual finish line of the [[Berlin Marathon]].

==Political history==

A Soviet flag flew from a flagpole atop the gate from 1945 until 1957, when it was replaced by an East German flag. Since the reunification of Germany, the flag and the pole have been removed. During the 1953 riots in East Berlin the Soviet flag was torn off by West Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMzcpPMRHe8|title=Dramatic Scenes - Berlin Riots (1953)|first=|last=British Pathé|date=13 April 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] visited the Brandenburg Gate. The Soviets hung large red banners across it to prevent him looking into East Berlin.

In the 1980s, decrying the existence of two German states and two Berlins, West Berlin mayor [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] said: "The German question is open as long as the Brandenburg Gate is closed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1987/061287d.htm |title=Remarks on East-West Relations at the Brandenburg Gate in West Berlin |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 1987, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] spoke to the West Berlin populace at the Brandenburg Gate, demanding the razing of the Berlin Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remembering Reagan's "Tear Down This Wall" speech 25 years later |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57450779-503544/remembering-reagans-tear-down-this-wall-speech-25-years-later/ |publisher=CBS News |date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lessons from Reagan after "Tear down this wall" speech |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505267_162-57451211/lessons-from-reagan-after-tear-down-this-wall-speech/ |publisher= CBS News |date=12 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Addressing the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Reagan said, {{quote|General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate!

On 25 December 1989, less than two months after the Berlin Wall began to come down, the conductor [[Leonard Bernstein]] conducted the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] in a version of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] of [[Beethoven]] at the then newly opened Brandenburg Gate.  In the concluding choral movement of the symphony, the famous "Ode to Joy", the word ''Freude'' ("Joy") was replaced with ''Freiheit'' ("Freedom") to celebrate the fall of the Wall and the imminent reunification of [[Germany]].

On 2–3 October 1990, the Gate was the scene of the official ceremony to mark the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]].  At the stroke of midnight on 3 October, the [[flag of Germany|black-red-gold flag of West Germany]]—now the flag of a reunified Germany—was raised over the Gate.

On 12 July 1994, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] spoke at the Gate about peace in post–Cold War Europe.&lt;ref&gt;https://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga6-940712.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 November 2009, Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]], walked through Brandenburg Gate with Russia's Mikhail Gorbachev and Poland's [[Lech Wałęsa]] as part of the 20-year celebration of tearing down the Berlin Wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2009/11/09/germany-celebrates-fall-berlin-wall/ |title= Germany Celebrates Fall of the Berlin Wall |publisher=FoxNews |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/slideshow/world/2009/11/09/fall-berlin-wall#slide=28 |title=Fall of the Berlin Wall [slides/captions] |publisher=FoxNews |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 2011, Germany marked the 50th anniversary of the day the Berlin Wall started to go up with a memorial service and a minute of silence in memory of those who died trying to flee to the West.  "It is our shared responsibility to keep the memory alive and to pass it on to the coming generations as a reminder to stand up for freedom and democracy to ensure that such injustice may never happen again," Berlin Mayor [[Klaus Wowereit]] said.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel—who grew up behind the wall in Germany's communist eastern part—also attended the commemoration. German President [[Christian Wulff]] added, "It has been shown once again: Freedom is invincible at the end. No wall can permanently withstand the desire for freedom."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8699626/Germany-marks-50th-anniversary-of-Berlin-Wall.html |title=Germany marks 50th anniversary of Berlin Wall |publisher=UK Telegraph |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/08/13/germany-marks-construction-berlin-wall-1271894147/ |title=Germany Marks Construction of the Berlin Wall |agency=Associated Press |date=13 August 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2011 |work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/2011/08/11/reflecting-on-the-berlin-wall-50-years-after-its-construction/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130125070351/http://www.history.com/news/2011/08/11/reflecting-on-the-berlin-wall-50-years-after-its-construction/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=25 January 2013 |title=Reflecting on the Berlin Wall, 50 Years After Its Construction |publisher=History.com |date=11 August 2011 |accessdate=13 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 June 2013, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] spoke at the Gate about nuclear arms reduction and the recently revealed U.S. internet surveillance activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/19/obama-berlin-speech-nuclear-arms | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Dan | last1=Roberts | first2=Kate | last2=Connolly | title=Obama calls for reduction in nuclear arms in broad-brush Berlin speech | date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 5 January 2015, the lights illuminating the gate were completely shut off in protest against a protest held by far-right anti-Islamic group [[Pegida]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tagesspiegel]]: [http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/polizei-justiz/berliner-pegida-protestiert-in-mitte-baergida-und-gegendemonstrationen-beendet/11186364.html Bärgida und Gegendemonstration beendet (in German)], 5 January 2015, retrieved 20 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|RBB]]: [http://www.rbb-online.de/politik/beitrag/2015/01/bergida-pegida-berlin-brandenburger-tor-gegendemo.html Licht aus am Brandenburger Tor (in German)]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "Lights off at Brandenburg Gate", 5 January 2015, retrieved 20 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Storify: [https://storify.com/reportedly/anti-islamization-rally-in-germany-met-with-countr Anti-islamization rally in Germany met with countrywide protests], 5 January 2015, retrieved 20 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, [[Die Zeit]] noted that the gate was not illuminated in Russian colours after the [[2017 Saint Petersburg Metro bombing]]. The gate was previously illuminated after attacks in Jerusalem and Orlando. The Berlin Senate only lets the gate be illuminated for events in partner cities and cities with a special connection to Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/gesellschaft/zeitgeschehen/2017-04/berlin-brandenburger-tor-anschlag-st-petersburg-farben-russland|title=Berlin: Für St. Petersburg leuchtet das Brandenburger Tor nicht|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central American Defense Council''' ({{lang-es|Consejo de Defensa Centroamericana or Condeca}}) was an alliance of [[Central America]]n countries (El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama). It was created by a treaty signed on December 14, 1963 in [[Guatemala City]], for the common purpose of quelling the various [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] guerrilla movements that threatened stability in the region during the [[Cold War]]. [[Costa Rica]], which had no standing armed forces, participated as a member.  It is now defunct.

A '''ceremony''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|'|s|ɛ|r|ɪ|m|ə|n|i}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|s|ɛ|r|ə|ˌ|m|oʊ|n|i}}) is an event of [[ritual]] significance, performed on a special occasion. The word may be of [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] origin, via the Latin ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#caerimonia|caerimonia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimes|first=Ronald L.|editor=Willi Braun, Russell T. McCutcheon|title=Guide to the study of religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlNJQoZlGC4C&amp;pg=PA260|year=2000|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0304701769|page=260|chapter=Ritual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceremonial occasions==
A ceremony may mark a [[rite of passage]] in a human life, marking the significance of, for example:

* [[childbirth|birth]]
* [[initiation]] (college [[orientation week]])
* [[puberty]]
* social [[adulthood]] ([[Bar Mitzvah|Bar (or Bat) Mitzvah]])
* [[graduation]]
* union (marriage)
* [[award ceremony|awarding]]
* [[retirement]]
* [[death]] ([[Day of the Dead]])
* [[burial]] ([[funeral]])
* [[spirituality|spiritual]] ([[baptism]], [[Communion (Christian)|communion]])

==Celebration of events==
Other, society-wide ceremonies may mark annual or seasonal or recurrent events such as:

* vernal [[equinox]], [[winter solstice]] and other annual astronomical positions
* weekly [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]] day
* [[inauguration]] of an elected office-holder
* occasions in a [[liturgical year]] or "feasts" in a [[calendar of saints]]
* Opening and closing of a sports event, such as the [[Olympic Games ceremony|Olympic Games]]

Other ceremonies underscore the importance of non-regular special occasions, such as:

* [[coronation]] of a [[monarch]]
* victory in [[battle]]

In some Asian cultures, ceremonies also play an important social role, for example the [[tea ceremony]].

==Process==
Ceremonies may have a physical display or [[theatre|theatrical]] component: [[dance]], a [[procession]], the laying on of hands. A declaratory verbal pronouncement may explain or cap the occasion, for instance:

* I now pronounce you husband and wife.
* I swear to serve and defend the nation ...
* I declare open the games of ...
* I/We dedicate this ...  ... to ...

Both physical and verbal components of a ceremony may become part of a [[liturgy]].

'''''Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960–2010''''' is a 2012 book by  [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]], a political scientist and W.H. Brady Scholar at the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. In the book Murray describes what he sees as the [[Income inequality in the United States|economic divide]] and moral bifurcation of white Americans that has occurred since 1960. He focuses on white Americans to state that the decline he describes was not being experienced solely by minorities, whom he brings into his argument in the last few chapters of the book.

Murray describes several differences he sees forming between and causing two emerging classes—the New Upper Class and the New Lower class—among which are differences in or lack thereof in regards to religiosity, work ethic, industriousness, family, etc. Murray goes on to provide evidence that religiosity, work ethic, industriousness, family, etc., have either remained strong or have weakened minimally in the New Upper Class, whereas these same attributes have either weakened substantially or have become almost nonexistent in the New Lower Class. Much of his argument is centered on a notion of self-selective sorting that began in the 1960s and 1970s, when he argues that cognitive ability became the essential predictor of professional and financial success, and people overwhelmingly began marrying others in the same cognitive stratum and living in areas surrounded largely by others in that same stratum, leading to not only an exacerbation of existing economic divides, but an unprecedented sociocultural divide that had not existed before in America.

==Reception==
''Coming Apart'' was included in ''The New York Times''´s list of 100 Notable Books of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/100-notable-books-of-2012.html?pagewanted=2|title = 100 Notable Books of 2012|date = 2012-12-02|accessdate = 2013-07-05|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cotzumalhuapa''' archaeological culture is from the piedmont area of the [[Escuintla Department]], [[Guatemala]]. The '''Cotzumalhuapa archaeological zone''' is near the town of [[Santa Lucía Cotzumalguapa]] (the city is spelled with a ''g'' —  ''Cotzumalguapa'' — and the culture tends to be spelled with an ''h'' — ''Cotzumalhuapa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bilbao area culture, Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, Escuintla, Guatemala |url=https://www.maya-archaeology.org/Mayan_archaeology_art_museums_Guatemala_national_parks_travel_tourism/Bilbao_Cotzumalhuapa_stone_sculpture_monuments_Toltec_Teotihuacan_Aztec_trans-oceanic_influence_Etruscan_Phoenician_Greek_Mediterranean.php |website=Asociacion FLAAR Mesoamerica |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cotzumalhuapa archaeological zone is a [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mayan civilization|Maya]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] zone dating mainly to the Late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]] in [[Mesoamerica]]n chronology, although it was occupied since the Middle [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]] and there is evidence of a major development during the Late [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]].

The famous [[Stela]] 1 from [[El Baúl]] has one of the earliest inscriptions in Mesoamerica, with the earliest legible [[Maya script|hieroglyphic]] [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] date in Guatemala equaling 37 CE.

==Introduction==
Cotzumalhuapa is located on the Pacific piedmont of southern [[Guatemala]], in the [[Escuintla Department]], on the outskirts of modern Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa. During the Late Classic period, Cotzumalhuapa was a major city that extended more than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi}}. It encompassing three major compounds, known as [[El Baúl]], [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]], and El Castillo, with extensive settlements between and around them.

The Cotzumalhuapa Zone contains not only the 3 main sites, but the minor site of Golón as well as connecting stone-paved causeways and bridges.  Its main structures were made of earthen filling and carefully chosen stones. There have been found more than 200 structures and 187 sculptured monuments here dating from Pre-Classic (see Stela 1, to right, dated at 37 [[Common Era|CE]]) to the Late Classic (600-1000 CE).  In the Late Classic phase, El Baúl was one of the most important Pacific coast sites.

==Artefacts==
A corpus of more than 200 monumental sculptures are known from the city and from neighboring sites that include [[Palo Verde (Mesoamerican site)|Palo Verde]], Aguna, [[Palo Gordo (Mesoamerican site)|Palo Gordo]], and others. Examples of the Cotzumalhuapa sculptural style are found across the Pacific Coast and highlands of [[Guatemala]], and into [[El Salvador]], where [[Cara Sucia (Mesoamerican site)|Cara Sucia]] marks the southeastern limit of the Cotzumalhuapa zone.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie Hingston (1989, 2003), p. 135. {{cite web | title=Cara Sucia / El Imposible | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/207/ | publisher=[[UNESCO]] | accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
The inhabitants of Cotzumalhuapa developed an original artistic style and a [[writing system]] of their own, which remains undeciphered. Hieroglyphic signs usually are inscribed in circular cartouches, but they may also acquire complex animated forms. The number of known inscriptions is quite small.

Cotzumalhuapa people produced a large corpus of monumental sculptures. These include [[Petroglyph|rock carvings]], [[stela]]e, altars, colossal heads, and sculptures, both free-standing and as a component of the architecture (e. g. carved stairs, pillars, and pavement stones). There are also numerous portable sculptures.

Characteristic of the Cotzumalguapa style is an extraordinary degree of realism in the representation of human figures, which in many cases may be considered as individual portraits, possibly representing kings and nobles. In many cases, these individuals participate in complex scenes, where they interact with other human characters or with supernatural beings. Sacrificial scenes are frequent.

Distinctive elements of the Cotzumalguapa style include [[speech scroll]]s shaped as vines with a variety of flowers and fruits.

==Influence==
Cotzumalhuapa was most likely the seat of a powerful state, which exerted political control over a vast region of the Pacific coast. The diffusion of the sculptural style provides a measure of the geographic extension of Cotzumalguapa influence. The style is found along a 200 kilometer stretch of the Pacific coast, from the modern border between Guatemala and [[El Salvador]] to the department of [[Suchitepéquez]]. It also had strong presence in some regions of the Central and Eastern Highlands, particularly in the region of [[Antigua Guatemala]]. Some elements of the style are perceptible in sculptures from various sites located in [[Chimaltenango]] in the Central Highlands, the western Pacific Coastal area, and the [[Motagua River]] valley.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1505">In [[natural language]], a '''deferred reference''' is the [[metonymy|metonymic]] use of an expression to refer to an entity related to the conventional meaning of that expression, but not denoted by it. Several types of deferred reference have been studied in the literature.

== Examples ==
=== English ===

The following examples are from (Nunberg 1995):

* (server to a co-worker in a deli) ''The ham sandwich'' is at table 7.
* (restaurant patron to a valet, indicating a key) ''This'' is parked out back.
* ''Yeats'' is still widely read.
&lt;!--* The table is made of ''oak''. "Oak" often means "timber from an oak tree": this example is literal and not a metaphor. --&gt;

The '''Delaware languages''', also known as the '''Lenape languages''', are [[Munsee language|Munsee]] and [[Unami language|Unami]], two closely related languages of the [[Eastern Algonquian languages|Eastern Algonquian]] subgroup of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian language family]]. Munsee and Unami were spoken [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal]]ly by the [[Lenape]] people in the vicinity of the modern [[New York City]] area in the [[United States]], including western [[Long Island]], [[Manhattan Island]], [[Staten Island]], as well as adjacent areas on the mainland: [[Lower Hudson Valley|southeastern New York State]], eastern [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]], and coastal [[Delaware]].&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213; Goddard, Ives, 1997, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Munsee  are assigned to the Algonquian language family, and are analysed as members of [[Eastern Algonquian]], a subgroup of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]].

The languages of the Algonquian family constitute a group of historically related languages descended from a common source language, [[Proto-Algonquian language|Proto-Algonquian]]. The Algonquian languages are spoken across Canada from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic coast; on the American Plains; south of the Great Lakes; and on the Atlantic coast. Many of the Algonquian languages are now extinct.

The [[Eastern Algonquian languages]] were spoken on the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic coast]] from what are now called the Canadian Maritime provinces to [[North Carolina]]. Many of the languages are now extinct, and some are known only from very fragmentary records.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern Algonquian is considered a genetic subgroup within the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian family]], that is, the Eastern Algonquian languages share a sufficient number of common innovations to suggest that they descend from a common intermediate source, Proto-Eastern Algonquian. The latter proto-language 
The linguistic closeness of Munsee and Unami entails that they share an immediate common ancestor which may be called ''Common Delaware;'' the two languages have diverged in distinct ways from Common Delaware.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1997, p. 85, n.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Several shared phonological innovations support a genetic subgroup consisting of the Delaware languages and [[Mahican language|Mahican]],&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 2008, pp. 280-282&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to as ''Delawaran''.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Unami and Munsee are more closely related to each other than to Mahican. Some historical evidence suggests commonalities between Mahican and Munsee.&lt;ref&gt;Pentland, David, 1992, pp. 15, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The line of historical descent is therefore Proto-Algonquian &gt; Proto-Eastern Algonquian &gt; Delawarean &gt; Common Delaware + Mahican, with Common Delaware splitting into Munsee and Unami.

==Geographic distribution==
Lenni Lenape means "Human Beings" or the "Real People" in the Unami language.&lt;ref name=p422&gt;Pritzker 422&lt;/ref&gt; Their ([[Endonym|autonym]]) is also spelled Lennape or Lenapi, in Unami ''Lënape''&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Tribe of Indians, Lenape Talking Dictionary: [http://www.talk-lenape.org/detail.php?id=3882 Lënape] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019200607/http://www.talk-lenape.org/detail.php?id=3882 |date=2014-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Munsee ''Lunaapeew''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenape.ca Lunaapeew - Delaware Nation - Lunaapeew Language - Lenape - Moraviantown, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113093155/http://www.lenape.ca/ |date=2014-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "the people." The term "Delaware" was used by the English, who named the people for their territory by the [[Delaware River]]. They named the river in honor of [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De La Warr]], the governor of the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=p422/&gt; The English colonists used the [[exonym]] "Delaware" for almost all the Lenape people living along this river and its tributaries.

It is estimated that as late as the seventeenth century there were approximately forty Delaware local village bands with populations of possibly a few hundred persons per group. Estimates for the early contact period vary considerably, with a range of 8,000 - 12,000 given.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates for approximately 1600 AD suggest 6,500 Unami and 4,500 Munsee, with data lacking for Long Island Munsee.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 214, Table 1&lt;/ref&gt; These groups were never united politically or linguistically, and the names ''Delaware, '' ''Munsee, '' and ''Unami'' postdate the period of consolidation of these local groups.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213" /&gt; The earliest use of the term Munsee was recorded in 1727, and Unami in 1757.&lt;ref name="Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xvii"&gt;Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensity of contact with European settlers resulted in the gradual displacement of Delaware peoples from their aboriginal homeland, in a series of complex population movements involving displacement and consolidation of small local groups, extending over a period of more than two hundred years.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 213" /&gt; The currently used names were gradually applied to the larger groups resulting from this process. The ultimate result was the displacement of virtually all Delaware-speaking peoples from their homeland to Oklahoma, Kansas, Wisconsin, upstate New York, and Canada.

Two distinct Unami-speaking groups emerged in Oklahoma in the late nineteenth century, the Registered (Cherokee) Delaware in Washington, Nowata, and Craig Counties, and the Absentee Delaware of Caddo County.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 224"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently there were a small number of Unami speakers in Oklahoma, but the language is now [[extinct language|extinct]] there. Some language revitalization work is underway by the [[Delaware Nation|Delaware Tribe]] of Indians.

Equally affected by consolidation and dispersal, Munsee groups moved to several locations in southern Ontario as early as the late eighteenth century, to [[Moravian 47, Ontario|Moraviantown]], [[Munsee-Delaware Nation 1, Ontario|Munceytown]], and [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Six Nations]]. Several different patterns of migration led to groups of Munsee speakers moving to [[Stockbridge-Munsee Community|Stockbridge]], Wisconsin; [[Cattaraugus Reservation, Erie County, New York|Cattaraugus]], New York; and Kansas.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, pp. 220-224"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, pp. 220-224&lt;/ref&gt; Today Munsee survives only at Moraviantown, where there are two fluent speakers aged 77 and 90 as of 2018.

===Dialects and varieties===
Munsee and Unami are linguistically very similar. Therefore, they have been considered dialects of one language, and both together have been referred to as the language of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians, as can be seen in the ''Grammar of the language of the Lenni Lenape or Delaware Indians'', written by the Moravian missionary David Zeisberger and published in a translation from German into English by Peter Stephen du Ponceau in 1827. Zeisberger does not even mention the "dialect" names when describing varying grammatical features, while the translator refers to them in two annotations.&lt;ref&gt;Zeisberger, 1827, p. [https://archive.org/stream/grammaroflanguag00zeis#page/36/mode/2up 36], [https://archive.org/stream/grammaroflanguag00zeis#page/n57/mode/2up 57].&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their relative closeness the two are sufficiently distinguished by features of syntax, phonology, and vocabulary that speakers of both consider them not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] so that, more recently, linguists have treated them as separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. v&lt;/ref&gt;

Munsee Delaware was spoken in the central and lower [[Hudson River|Hudson River Valley]], western Long Island, the upper [[Delaware River|Delaware River Valley]], and the northern third of New Jersey.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives 1997, p. 43"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, pp. 213-214; Goddard, Ives, 1997, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; While dialect variation in Munsee was likely there is no information about possible dialectal subgroupings.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Unami Delaware was spoken in the area south of Munsee speakers in the Delaware River Valley and New Jersey, south of the [[Delaware Water Gap]] and the [[Central Jersey|Raritan Valley]].&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives 1997, p. 43" /&gt;

Three dialects of Unami are distinguished: Northern Unami, Southern Unami, and Unalachtigo.

Northern Unami, now extinct, is recorded in large amounts of materials collected by Moravian missionaries but is not reflected in the speech of any modern groups.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1971, p. 14; Goddard, Ives, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The Northern Unami groups were south of the Munsee groups, with the southern boundary of the Northern Unami area being at Tohickon Creek on the west bank of the Delaware River and between Burlington and Trenton on the east bank.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 215"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

The poorly known Unalachtigo dialect is described as having been spoken in the area between Northern and Southern Unami, with only a small amount of evidence from one group.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 215" /&gt;

Southern Unami, to the south of the Northern Unami-Unalachtigo area, was reflected in the Unami Delaware spoken by Delawares in Oklahoma, but is now extinct.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 215" /&gt;

===Ethnonyms===
Names for the speakers of Munsee and Unami are used in complex ways in both [[English language|English]] and the Delaware languages. The Unami language is sometimes called ''Delaware'' or ''Delaware proper,'' reflecting the original application of the term Delaware to Unami speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978, p. 73; Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Both Munsee and Unami speakers use ''Delaware'' as a self-designation in English.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1974, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unamis residing in Oklahoma are sometimes referred to as ''Oklahoma Delaware'', while the Munsees in Ontario are sometimes referred to as ''Ontario Delaware'' or ''Canadian Delaware.''&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Goddard, Ives, 1971, p. 11, n. 1-2; Goddard, Ives, 1974, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Munsee-speaking residents of Moraviantown use the English term ''Munsee'' to refer to residents of Munceytown, approximately {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} to the east and refer to themselves in English as ''Delaware'', and in Munsee as {{IPA|/lənáːpeːw/}} 'Delaware person, Indian'.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1971, p. 11, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Oklahoma Delawares refer to Ontario Delaware as {{IPA|/mwə́nsi/}} or {{IPA|/mɔ́nsi/}}, terms that are also used for people of Munsee ancestry in their own communities.

Some Delawares at Moraviantown also use the term [[Christian Munsee|Christian Indian]] as a preferred self-designation in English.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1974, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; There is an equivalent Munsee term ''ké·ntə̆we·s'' 'one who prays, Moravian convert'.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1978a, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Munsee speakers refer to Oklahoma Delawares as Unami in English or /wə̆ná·mi·w/ in Munsee. The [[Oklahoma]] Delawares refer to themselves in English as Delaware and in Unami as /ləná·p·e/.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1971, p. 11, n. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The name [[Lenape]], which is sometimes used in English for both ''Delaware'' languages together, is the name Unami speakers also use for their own language in English,&lt;ref&gt;Mithun, Marianne, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://delawaretribe.org/ Delaware Tribe of Indians]: [http://www.talk-lenape.org/ Lenape talking dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Munsee speakers call their language in English ''Lunaapeew''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenape.ca/ Lenape.ca - The Delaware Nation Language, Cultural &amp; Historical Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204021319/http://lenape.ca/ |date=2013-12-04 }}. Our Departments vision: To ensure Lunaapeew Language transmission for future generations.&lt;/ref&gt; Uniquely among scholars, Kraft uses Lenape as a cover term to refer to all Delaware-speaking groups.&lt;ref&gt;Kraft, Herbert, 1986, p. xviii; Kraft, Herbert, 1986a, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Munsee speakers refer to their language as /hə̀lə̆ni·xsəwá·kan/ 'speaking the Delaware language'.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, John, 1996, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sounds==
Munsee and Unami have similar but not identical inventories of consonants and vowels, and have a significant number of phonological rules in common. For example, both languages share the same basic rules for assigning syllable weight and stress.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, pp. 21, 26&lt;/ref&gt; However, Unami has innovated by regularizing the assignment of stress in some verb forms so that the penultimate syllable is stressed even when the stress assignment rule would predict stress on the antepenultimate syllable.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, pp. 21, 26, 107, 130-131&lt;/ref&gt; As well, Unami has innovated relative to Munsee by adding phonological rules that significantly change the pronunciation of many Unami words relative to the corresponding Munsee words.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

This section focuses upon presenting general information about Munsee and Unami sounds and phonology, with detailed discussion reserved for entries for each language.

Munsee and Unami have the same basic inventories of consonants, as in the following chart.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Unami is analysed as having contrastive long voiceless stops: ''p·, t·, č·, k·;'' and long voiceless fricatives: ''s·, š·, and x·.''&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, p. vi; see also Goddard, Ives, 1997, p. 45 for a consonant chart&lt;/ref&gt; The raised dot /·/ is used to indicate length of a preceding consonant or vowel. A full analysis and description of the status of the long consonants is not available, and more than one analysis of Delaware consonants has been proposed. Some analyses only recognize long stops and fricatives as predictable, i.e. as arising by rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1969; Pearson, Bruce, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The contrastive long consonants are described as having low functional yield, that is, they differentiate relatively few pairs of words, but nonetheless do occur in contrasting environments. Both languages have rules that lengthen consonants in certain environments.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979, pp. 22, xii (rule U-6); p. 26 (rule U-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

Several additional consonants occur in Munsee loan words: /f/ in e.g. ''nə̀fó·ti'' 'I vote'; /r/ in ''ntáyrəm''.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1982"&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of alternate analyses of Munsee and Unami vowels have been proposed. In one, the two languages are analysed as having the same basic vowel system, consisting of four long vowels /i· o· e· a·/, and two short vowels /ə a/.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979: 11&lt;/ref&gt; This vowel system is equivalent to the vowel system reconstructed for Proto-Eastern-Algonquian.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1979a, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative analyses reflect several differences between the two languages. In this analysis Munsee is analysed as having contrasting length in all positions, with the exception of /ə/.&lt;ref name="Goddard, Ives, 1982" /&gt; In cells with two vowels, the first is long.

Similarly, Unami vowels have also been analysed as organized into contrasting long-short pairs.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1997: 45&lt;/ref&gt; One asymmetry is that high short /u/ is paired with long /o·/, and the pairing of long and short /ə/ is noteworthy. In cells with two vowels, the first is long.

==Vocabulary==

===Loan words===

Both Munsee and Unami have loan words from European languages, reflecting early patterns of contact between Delaware speakers and European traders and settlers. The first Europeans to have sustained contact with the Delaware were Dutch explorers and traders, and loan words from Dutch are particularly common. Dutch is the primary source of loan words in Munsee and Unami.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1974a&lt;/ref&gt;

Because many of the early encounters between Delaware speakers and Dutch explorers and settlers occurred in Munsee territory, Dutch loanwords are particularly common in Munsee, although there are also a number in Unami as well.

Many Delaware borrowings from Dutch are nouns that name items of material culture that were presumably salient or novel for Delaware speakers, as is reflected in the following borrowed words.&lt;ref&gt;Examples in table are from Goddard, Ives, 1974a&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable" border="1"
|+ Munsee and Unami Words From Dutch
|-
!width="100"| Munsee	|| width="100"| Unami	|| width="250"| Dutch
|-
| hé·mpət	|| hémpəs	|| ''hemd'' [hɛmpt] "shirt, vest"
|-
| á·pə̆ləš	|| á·p·ələš	|| ''appels'' ['ɑpəls] "apples"

|-
| mó·kəl	|| mɔ́·k·əl	|| ''moker'' ['mo:kər] "maul, sledgehammer"
|}

More recent borrowings tend to be from English such as the following Munsee loan words: ''ahtamó·mpi·l'' 'automobile'; ''kátəl'' 'cutter'; ''nfó·təw'' 's/he votes'.&lt;ref&gt;Examples retranscribed using phonetic symbols, from O'Meara, John, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one known Swedish loan word in Unami: ''típa·s'' 'chicken', from Swedish ''tippa,'' a call to chickens.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1974a, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing systems==
There is no standard writing system for either Munsee or Unami. Linguists have tended to use common phonetic transcription symbols of the type found in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] or similar [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] symbols in order to represent sounds that are not consistently represented in conventional standard writing systems.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Goddard, Ives, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans writing down Delaware words and sentences have tended to use adaptations of European alphabets and associated conventions. The quality of such renditions have varied widely, as Europeans attempted to record sounds and sound combinations they were not familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;Brinton, Daniel, and Albert Anthony, 1888; Zeisberger, David, 1887&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical orthographies for both Munsee and Unami have been created in the context of various language preservation and documentation projects. A recent bilingual dictionary of Munsee uses a practical orthography derived from a linguistic transcription system for Munsee.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, John, 1996; see Goddard, Ives, 1979 for the underlying transcription system&lt;/ref&gt; The same system is also used in a recent word book produced locally at Moraviantown.&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Nation Council, 1992, pp. 57-63&lt;/ref&gt;

The online Unami [http://www.talk-lenape.org/ Lenape Talking Dictionary] uses a practical system distinct from that for Munsee. However, other practically oriented Unami materials use a writing system with conventional phonetic symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blalock, Lucy, et al., 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing system samples===
The table below presents a sample of Unami words, written first in a linguistically oriented transcription, followed by the same words written in a practical system.&lt;ref&gt;Words in linguistically oriented transcription taken from Goddard, Ives, 1997, pp. 45-47, 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenape Talking Dictionary. [http://www.talk-lenape.org/ Lenape Talking Dictionary]. Delaware Tribe of Indians. Retrieved on April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic system uses the acute accent to indicate predictable stress and a raised dot (·) to indicate vowel and consonant length. The practical system interprets the contrast between long and corresponding short vowels as one of quality, using acute and grave accents to indicate vowel quality. Stress, which as noted is predictable, and consonant length are not indicated in the practical system.

The table below presents a sample of Munsee words, written first in a linguistically oriented transcription, followed by the same words written in a practical system.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard, Ives, 1982; O'Meara, John, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic system uses a raised dot {{angbr|·}} to indicate vowel length. Although stress is mostly predictable, the linguistic system uses the acute accent to indicate predictable main stress. As well, predictable voiceless or murmured /ă/ is indicated with the breve accent {{angbr|˘}}. Similarly, the breve accent is used to indicate an ultra-short {{IPA|[ə]}} that typically occurs before a single voiced consonant followed by a vowel.&lt;ref&gt;See Goddard, Ives, 1982, p. 19 for further detail&lt;/ref&gt; The practical system indicates vowel length by doubling the vowel letter, and maintains the linɡuistic system's practices for marking stress and voiceless/ultra-short vowels. The practical system uses orthographic {{angbr|sh}} for the phonetic symbol /š/, and {{angbr|ch}} for the phonetic symbol /č/.&lt;ref&gt;O'Meara, John, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Himalaya''' is a project that was founded in December 2000 by Alan Macfarlane and [[Mark Turin]]. The main purpose of the project is to preserve old digital materials near the Himalayas, such as photographs, recordings, and journals, and make those resources available over the internet and on DVD.

==Primary objectives==
When established in 2000, Digital Himalaya project had three primary objectives:&lt;ref&gt;cf Digital Himalaya website http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/overview.php&lt;/ref&gt;

*To preserve in a digital medium archival anthropological materials from the Himalayan region that are quickly degenerating in their current forms, including films in various formats, still photographs, sound recordings, field notes, maps and rare journals.
*To make these resources available over broadband internet connections, coupled with an accurate search and retrieval system useful to contemporary researchers and students.
*To make these resources available on [[DVD]] to the descendants of the people from whom the materials were collected by making them both easily transportable and viewable in a digital medium.

==First phase==
Five ethnographic collections representing a broad range of regions, ethnic groups, time periods, and themes were selected for digitisation in the first phase of the project, along with a set of maps of [[Nepal]] and important journals on Himalayan studies.

{{One source|date=November 2010}}
[[Image:Dog-ear.jpg|thumb|A dog-eared page.]]
A '''dog ear''' is a folded down corner of a [[book]] page. The name arises from the fact that the ears of many breeds of domestic dog flap over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metaphordogs.org/Dogs/entries/dogear.html The Canine in Conversation]&lt;/ref&gt;  A '''dog ear''' can serve as a [[bookmark]].  While generally frowned upon by those that want to preserve books in their original condition, it is particularly common in use on [[paperback]]s which are designed to be cheaper and more harshly used than [[hardcover]]s{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}.  Sometimes, it is also used to keep sheets of paper together, in the absence of a stapler or paper clip.

The phrase dates back at least to the late 18th century:
{{Quote|... those opinions quoted by the Hon. Gentleman from dog's-eared pages of pamphlets ... |[[William Pitt the Younger]]|address to the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]], Feb. 3, 1799.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tn8EAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA359 Parliamentary Chronicle, Vol. XXIV], W. Stratford, London, 1799; page 359&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dog-earing is also commonly used to mark a section or phrase in a book that one finds to be important or of personal meaning.

Dog-ears can range in size from the tip of the page to half the page. Although people generally dog-ear the top section of pages (on either side), some also dog-ear on the bottom half of pages. Dog-ears work best on thin pages. Dog-ears may be unmade by folding it back into its original location and compressing the pages of the book together. Removing dog-ears is not recommended on paper that has yellowed from age, as it may cause the flap to separate from the page. Dog-earing more than one successive page can cause problems, as the flaps (depending on the thickness of the paper and the number of pages) may cause the marked sections to bulge and distort the book. Reference works are most prone to this problem.

'''Dravidian studies''' (also '''Dravidology''') is the academic field devoted to the [[Dravidian languages]], literature and [[Dravidian culture|culture]]. It is a superset of [[Tamil studies]] and a subset of [[South Asian studies]].

==Early missionaries==

The 16th to 18th century missionaries who wrote Tamil grammars or lexica include [[Henrique Henriques]], [[Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg]] and [[Constantino Giuseppe Beschi]].

| [[Henrique Henriques]] || || 1520–1600 ||  [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Jesuit]] priest and [[missionary]]. After his initial days in [[Goa]] he moved to [[Tuticorin]]. As a missionary he strongly believed that books of religious doctrines should be in local languages. He is considered to be the first European Tamil scholar. He set up the first [[Printing in Tamil language|Tamil press]] and got books printed in Tamil script. The first book printed in Tamil script was "''Thambiran Vanakkam''" (தம்பிரான் வணக்கம்) (1578), a 16-page translation of the Portuguese "[[Doctrina Christiana|''Doctrina Christam'']]". Thereby, Tamil became the first non-European language to be printed on a printing press.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

He was among the first Protestant missionaries to arrive in India at the Danish colony of [[Tranquebar]] in 1706. He translated the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]] into Tamil.  In 1708 he compiled "''Bibliothece Malabarke''", listing the 161 Tamil books he had read and described their content.

==Dravidian language hypothesis==
The recognition that the Dravidian languages were a phylogenetic unit separate from Indo-European dates to 1816, and was presented by [[Francis Whyte Ellis|F. W. Ellis]], Collector of Madras, at the College of Fort St. George.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1919">'''Fasting spittle'''&amp;nbsp;– [[saliva]] produced first thing in the morning, before breakfast&amp;nbsp;– has been used to treat a wide variety of diseases for many hundreds of years. Spittle cures are usually considered to be more effective if [[fasting]] spittle is used.{{sfnp|Roud|2006|loc=wart cures: fasting spittle|ps=none}}

An early recorded use of spittle as a cure comes from the [[Gospel of Mark|Gospel of St Mark]], believed to have been written in about 70&amp;nbsp;AD:
{{bq|text=And they bring unto him [Jesus] one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech&amp;nbsp;... And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. {{bibleverse||Mark|7:32–5}}}}
Writing at about the same time as Mark, the Roman [[natural philosopher]] [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] commented in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' that fasting spittle was efficacious in the treatment of [[ophthalmia]], and that the fasting spittle of a woman was particularly beneficial for treating bloodshot eyes.{{r|OpieTatem}}

'''''GHLL''''' (originally '''''The Green Hills Literary Lantern''''') is a literary journal published by [[Truman State University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://engling.truman.edu/publications.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1990 by Jack Smith, a professor of [[English studies|English]] and [[Philosophy]] at North Central Missouri College as an inexpensively-produced outlet for student and faculty work, the annual quickly grew to a regional and national mission. Towards the end of its existence as a print publication, the magazine typically consisted of 300 pages of [[poetry]], [[fiction]] and nonfiction [[prose]].

In 2005, due to financial issues, the journal moved to an open-access, web-only format. The first digital issue was XVII. It was among the earliest of academic literary magazines available exclusively online and quickly collected a 'Best of the Web" award &lt;ref&gt;http://www.powells.com/blog/?p=3693&lt;/ref&gt;

Listings in professional directories characterize the editorial policy as open, though with “emphasis on craft.” ''GHLL'' reviews poetry and novels from lesser-known, independent presses &lt;ref&gt;http://www.newpages.com/magazinestand/litmags/reviews_archive_2003/2003_10/oct2003.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Prose is selected by Jack Smith, verse by poet and novelist Joe Benevento. The editorial board as of 2008 consists of Geoffrey Clark, Erin Flanagan, Barry Kitterman, Robert Garner McBrearty, Midge Raymond, Doug Rennie, Jude Russell, Nat Smith, John Talbird, and Mark Wisniewkski.

''GHLL'' has a tradition of openness to first-time authors, though a number of writers have made multiple appearances, including fiction writers [[Karl Harshbarger]], [[William Eisner]], [[Ian MacMillan (author)|Ian MacMillan]], [[DeWitt Henry]] (founder of [[Ploughshares]]), [[Virgil Suarez]] and [[Walter Cummins]]. Regularly contributing poets include [[Lisa Alexander Baron]], [[Jim Thomas (poet)|Jim Thomas]], [[Joanne Lowery]], [[Lee Rossi]], [[David Lawrence (poet)|David Lawrence]], [[Mark Belair]], [[Nancy Cherry]], [[Sudie Nostrand]], [[Terry Savoie]], [[Francine Marie Tolf]], [[Fredrick Zydek]], [[William Jollif]], [[Lee Slonimsky]], [[Terry Godbey]], [[Rachel Squires Bloom]] and [[Yvette Schnoeker-Shorb]], as well as the first [[poet laureate]] of [[Missouri]], [[Walter Bargen]]. The journal is indexed by numerous directories,[http://www.missouribooks.org/node/40] including the ''American Directory of Writer's Guidelines'', ''Writers’ Market'' (various editions), the ''International Directory of Literary and Little Magazines'', ''Index of American Periodical Verse''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/poetryja.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Fadlo [[Hourani]]''' (June 3, 1913 – September 19, 1984) was a British philosopher, historian, and classicist. He is best known for his work in [[Islamic philosophy]], which focused on [[Mu'tazila|classical Islamic rationalism]] and [[Islamic ethics|ethics]].

==Biography==

George Hourani was born into a prosperous British family of [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]  [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] extraction in [[Didsbury|Didsbury, Manchester]]. He was the fourth of six children, having three older sisters and two younger brothers. His brothers were [[Albert Hourani]] and Cecil Hourani.

George spent his early years studying Greek and Latin language and literature, winning successive scholarships at the [[Mill Hill School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], and developing an interest in philosophy and international affairs. A subsequent trip to the Near East influenced his decision to pursue a doctoral degree in Oriental Studies at Princeton University, where [[Philip Hitti]] would first suggest a focus on Islamic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Marmura, Michael E. Introduction. ''Islamic Theology and Philosophy: Studies in Honor of George F. Hourani.'' Albany: SUNY Press, 1984. 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completing his dissertation on 9th and 10th century Arab seafaring, Hourani secured a lecturing position at the [[Arab College (Jerusalem)|Government Arab College]] in Jerusalem, Palestine, which he held until the end of the [[Mandatory Palestine|mandate]] in 1948. In 1950, Hourani was invited to join the newly founded Department of Near Eastern Studies at the [[University of Michigan]], where he would reside until 1967. At Michigan, Hourani began to more seriously explore ethics and Islamic philosophy, contributing the definitive ''Averroes on the Harmony of Religion and Philosophy'' and beginning to explore the [[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]] ethics of [[Abd al-Jabbar]].

This work would be continued after 1967 in the University at Buffalo Department of Philosophy, where Hourani would teach until his retirement. In 1971, his work on Abd al-Jabbar was published. That summer, however, a latent cardiac condition led to the first of two heart attacks. The second, in 1977, would require surgery. Nonetheless, Hourani continued to teach, travel, and write, becoming President of the American Oriental Society in 1978, lecturing at UCLA in 1979, and being recognized as a Distinguished Professor of Islamic Thought and Civilization in 1980. He retired in 1983 and, as a result of his heart condition, died in September 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 105, No. 1 (Jan. - Mar., 1985), pp. 3-6&lt;/ref&gt; His final book and final contribution, ''Reason and Tradition in Islamic Ethics,'' was published posthumously the next year.

[[Globalization]], the flow of information, goods, capital, and people across political and geographic boundaries, allows infectious diseases to rapidly spread around the world, while also allowing the alleviation of factors such as hunger and poverty, which are key determinants of global health.&lt;ref name= global&gt;{{cite web |author=Daulaire, N. |title=Globalization and Health |date=July 12, 1999 |work=International RoundtabResponses to Globalization: Rethinking Equity and Health’ jointly organized by the Society for International Development (SID), the World Health Organization (WHO), and The Rockefeller Foundation (RF) |url=http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622194117/http://www.globalhealth.org/assets/html/drmed3.html|archivedate=2011-06-22}} &lt;!-- same as doi:10.1057/palgrave.development.1110077 ? --&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of diseases across wide geographic scales has increased through history.  Early diseases that spread from Asia to Europe were bubonic plague, influenza of various types, and similar infectious diseases.

In the current era of globalization, the world is more interdependent than at any other time.  Efficient and inexpensive transportation has left few places inaccessible, and increased global trade in agricultural products has brought more and more people into contact with animal diseases that have subsequently jumped [[species]] barriers (see [[zoonosis]]).&lt;ref name= Well &gt;http://www.richardwellsresearch.com/richardwells/pdfs%20and%20documents/BJIC%20Oct&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization intensified during the [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]], but trading routes had long been established between Asia and Europe, along which diseases were also transmitted.  An increase in travel has helped spread diseases to natives of lands who had not previously been exposed.  When a [[Indigenous peoples|native]] population is infected with a new disease, where they have not developed [[antibodies]] through generations of previous exposure, the new disease tends to run rampant within the population.

[[Etiology]], the modern branch of [[science]] that deals with the causes of [[infectious disease]], recognizes five major modes of disease transmission: airborne, waterborne, bloodborne, by direct contact, and through [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] ([[insect]]s or other creatures that carry germs from one species to another).&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;{{cite book |first=Linda Jacobs |last=Altman |title=Plague and Pestilence: A History of Infectious Disease |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8dzZAFnHmQC |year=1998 |publisher=Enslow |isbn=978-0-89490-957-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans began traveling over seas and across lands which were previously isolated, research suggests that diseases have been spread by all five transmission modes.

==Travel patterns and globalization==
The [[Age of Discovery|Age of Exploration]] generally refers to the period between the 15th and 17th centuries.  During this time, technological advances in [[shipbuilding]] and navigation made it easier for nations to explore outside previous boundaries.  Globalization has had many benefits, for example, new products to [[European ethnic groups|European]]s were discovered, such as [[tea]], [[silk]] and [[sugar]] when Europeans developed new [[trade routes]] around [[Africa]] to [[India]] and the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]], [[Asia]], and eventually running to the [[Americas]].

In addition to trading in goods, many nations began to trade in [[slavery]].  Trading in slaves was another way by which diseases were carried to new locations and peoples, for instance, from sub-Saharan Africa to the Caribbean and the Americas.  During this time, different [[societies]] began to integrate, increasing the concentration of [[human]]s and [[animal]]s in certain places, which led to the emergence of new diseases as some jumped in mutation from animals to humans.

During this time [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]]s' and [[witch doctor]]s' treatment of disease was often focused on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[religion]], and healing the entire [[Human body|body]] and [[soul]], rather than focusing on a few symptoms like [[modern medicine]].  Early medicine often included the use of [[herbs]] and [[meditation]].  Based on archeological evidence, some prehistoric practitioners in both Europe and South America used [[trephining]], making a hole in the skull to release illness.&lt;ref&gt;"One curious method of providing the disease with means of escape from the body was by making a hole, 2.5 to five centimeters across, in the skull of the victim—the practice of trepanning, or trephining. Trepanned skulls of prehistoric date have been found in Britain, France, and other parts of Europe and in Peru. Many of them show evidence of healing and, presumably, of the patient's survival. The practice still exists among primitive people in parts of Algeria, in Melanesia, and perhaps elsewhere, though it is fast becoming extinct. "Medicine, History of",  (2006), in ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved November 22, 2006, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-35642&lt;/ref&gt;  Severe diseases were often thought of as [[supernatural]] or magical.  The result of the introduction of Eurasian diseases to the Americas was that many more native peoples were killed by disease and [[Microorganism|germs]] than by the colonists' use of guns or other weapons.  Scholars estimate that over a period of four centuries, epidemic diseases wiped out as much as 90 percent of the American indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

In Europe during the age of exploration, diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]] and [[tuberculosis]] (TB) had already been introduced centuries before through trade with Asia and Africa.  People had developed some antibodies to these and other diseases from the Eurasian continent.  When the Europeans traveled to new lands, they carried these diseases with them.  (Note: Scholars believe TB was already endemic in the Americas.)  When such diseases were introduced for the first time to new populations of humans, the effects on the native populations were widespread and deadly. The [[Columbian Exchange]], referring to [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first contact with the native peoples of the [[Caribbean]], began the trade of animals, and plants, and unwittingly began an exchange of diseases.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

It was not until the 1800s that humans began to recognize the existence and role of germs and [[microbes]] in relation to disease.  Although many thinkers had ideas about germs, it was not until [[Louis Pasteur]] spread his [[germ theory|theory about germs]], and the need for washing hands and maintaining [[sanitation]] (particularly in medical practice), that anyone listened.  Many people were quite skeptical, but on May 22, 1881 Pasteur persuasively demonstrated the validity of his germ theory of disease with an early example of [[vaccination]]. The [[anthrax]] vaccine was administered to 25 [[sheep]] while another 25 were used as a control. On May 31, 1881 all of the sheep were exposed to anthrax.  While every sheep in the [[control group]] died, each of the vaccinated sheep survived.&lt;ref name= CDCPT&gt;{{cite journal |author=Trachtman P |title=About the Cover: Experimentation du virus charbonneux: "Le Pelerin," 1922.

His findings, in conjunction with other vaccines that followed, changed the way globalization affected the world.

===Effects of globalization on disease in the modern world===
Modern modes of [[transportation]] allow more people and products to [[travel]] around the world at a faster pace; they also open the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious disease vectors.&lt;ref name=NAP&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.nap.edu/books/0309100984/html/22.html |title=''The Impact of Globalization on Infectious Disease Emergence and Control: Exploring the Consequences and Opportunities,'' Workshop Summary - Forum on Microbial Threats |publisher=Nap.edu |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the [[West Nile Virus]].  It is believed that this disease reached the [[United States]] via “mosquitoes that crossed the ocean by riding in airplane wheel wells and arrived in New York City in 1999.”&lt;ref name=NAP /&gt; With the use of air travel, people are able to go to foreign lands, contract a disease and not have any symptoms of illness until after they get home, and having exposed others to the disease along the way.

As medicine has progressed, many vaccines and cures have been developed for some of the worst diseases (plague, syphilis, typhus, cholera, malaria) which people suffer.  But, because the [[evolution]] of disease [[organisms]] is very rapid, even with vaccines, there is difficulty providing full [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to many diseases.  Finding vaccines at all for some diseases remains extremely difficult.  Without vaccines, the global world remains vulnerable to infectious diseases.

Evolution of disease presents a major threat in modern times.  For example, the current "swine flu" or [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1 virus]] is a new strain of an old form of flu, known for centuries as Asian flu based on its origin on that continent.  From 1918–1920, a post-[[World War I]] [[1918 flu pandemic|global influenza epidemic]] killed an estimated 50–100 million people, including half a million in the United States alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/reviews/reviewview.cfm?id=72 Dorothy A. Pettit and Janice Bailie, ''Before There Was Swine Flu''; Anne Sealey, Review: "A Cruel Wind: Pandemic Flu in America, 1918-1920"], eHistory, July Review, 2009; Ohio State University, accessed 26 Jan 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  H1N1 is a virus that has evolved from and partially combined with portions of avian, swine, and human flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=MacKenzie, Debora |title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic? |journal=New Scientist |issue=2706 |date=29 April 2009 |doi= |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization has increased the spread of infectious diseases from South to North, but also the risk of non-communicable diseases by transmission of culture and behavior from North to South. It is important to target and reduce the spread of infectious diseases in developing countries.  However, addressing the risk factors of non-comunicable diseases and lifestyle risks in the South that cause disease, such as use or consumption of tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy foods, is important as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ollila, Eeva |title=Global Health Priorities-Priorities of the Wealthy? |journal=Globalization and Health |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=6 |year=2005 |doi=10.1186/1744-8603-1-6 |pmid=15847685 |pmc=1143784 |url=http://www.globalizationandhealth.com/content/1/1/6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific diseases==

===Plague===
[[Bubonic plague]] is a variant of the deadly [[flea]]-borne disease [[Yersinia pestis|plague]], which is caused by the [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', that devastated human populations beginning in the 14th century.  Bubonic plague is primarily spread by fleas that lived on the [[black rat]], an animal that originated in south Asia and spread to Europe by the 6th century.  It became common to cities and villages, traveling by ship with explorers.  A human would become infected after being bitten by an infected flea.  The first sign of an infection of bubonic plague is swelling of the [[lymph nodes]], and the formation of [[buboes]].  These buboes would first appear in the groin or armpit area, and would often ooze [[pus]] or [[blood]].  Eventually infected individuals would become covered with dark splotches caused by bleeding under the skin.  The symptoms would be accompanied by a high [[fever]], and within four to seven days of infection, more than half the victims would die.&lt;ref name= Mariner&gt;http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?page=faq. Retrieved October 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14th and 15th century, humans did not know that a bacterium was the cause of plague, and efforts to slow the spread of disease were futile.

The first recorded outbreak of plague occurred in [[China]] in the 1330s, a time when China was engaged in substantial trade with western Asia and Europe.  The plague reached Europe in October 1347.  It was thought to have been brought into Europe through the port of [[Messina]], [[Sicily]], by a fleet of Genoese trading ships from [[Caffa|Kaffa]], a seaport on the [[Crimean peninsula]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;  When the ship left port in Kaffa, many of the inhabitants of the town were dying, and the crew was in a hurry to leave.  By the time the fleet reached Messina, all the crew were either dead or dying; the rats that took passage with the ship slipped unnoticed to shore and carried the disease with them and their fleas.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Within Europe, the plague struck port cities first, then followed people along both sea and land trade routes.  It raged through [[Italy]] into [[France]] and the [[British Isles]].  It was carried over the [[Alps]] into [[Switzerland]], and eastward into [[Hungary]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt; For a time during the 14th and 15th centuries, the plague would recede.  Every ten to twenty years, it would return.  Later [[epidemics]], however, were never as widespread as the earlier outbreaks, when 60% of the population died.

The plague has never died out.  From 1896–1918 the plague swept through India, taking the lives of over 12.5 million people.  Between 1906 and 1914, the Plague Research Commission was created, and published supplements to the ''Journal of Hygiene''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Catanach, I.J. |title=The "Globalization" of Disease? India and the Plague |journal=[[Journal of World History]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=131–153, See p. 131 |date=Spring 2001 |jstor=20078880 |doi=10.1353/jwh.2001.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles===
[[Measles]] is a highly contagious airborne [[virus]] spread by contact with infected oral and nasal fluids.  When a person with measles coughs or sneezes, he releases microscopic particles into the air.  During the 4- to 12-day [[incubation period]], an infected individual shows no symptoms, but as the disease progresses, the following symptoms appear: runny nose, cough, red eyes, extremely high fever and a rash.

Measles is an [[endemic disease]], meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people developed resistance.  In populations that have not been exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating.  In 1529, a measles outbreak in [[Cuba]] killed two-thirds of the natives who had previously survived smallpox.  Two years later measles was responsible for the deaths of half the indigenous population of [[Honduras]], and ravaged [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], and the [[Inca]] civilization.&lt;ref name= Mariner/&gt;

Historically, measles was very prevalent throughout the world, as it is highly contagious.  According to the National Immunization Program, 90% of people were infected with measles by age 15, acquiring immunity to further outbreaks.  Until a vaccine was developed in 1963, measles was considered to be deadlier than smallpox.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles&gt;{{cite book |author=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |chapter=Ch. 12: Measles |chapterurl=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html |veditors=Atkinson W, Wolfe S, Hamborsky J |title=Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases |publisher=Public Health Foundation |location=Washington DC |year=2012 |edition=12th |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310044843/https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/table-of-contents.html |archivedate=2017-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vaccination reduced the number of reported occurrences by 98%.  Major epidemics have predominantly occurred in unvaccinated populations, particularly among nonwhite [[Hispanic]] and [[African American]] children under 5 years old.&lt;ref name=CDCMeasles /&gt; In 2000 a group of experts determined that measles was no longer endemic in the United States.  The majority of cases that occur are among immigrants from other countries.

===Typhus===
Typhus is caused by ''[[rickettsia]]'', which is transmitted to humans through [[lice]].  The main [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for [[typhus]] is the [[Oriental rat flea|rat flea]].  Flea bites and infected flea feaces in the respiratory tract are the two most common methods of transmission.  In areas where rats are not common, typhus may also be transmitted through [[cat]] and [[opossum]] fleas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parola P, Vogelaers D, Roure C, Janbon F, Raoult D |title=Murine typhus in travelers returning from Indonesia |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=677–80 |year=1998 |pmid=9866749 |pmc=2640266 |doi=10.3201/eid0404.980423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[incubation period]] of typhus is 7–14 days.  The symptoms start with a [[fever]], then headache, [[rash]], and eventually [[stupor]].  Spontaneous recovery occurs in 80–90% of victims.

The first outbreak of typhus was recorded in 1489.  Historians believe that troops from the [[Balkans]], hired by the Spanish army, brought it to Spain with them.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; By 1490 typhus traveled from the eastern [[Mediterranean]] into [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], and by 1494, it had swept across Europe.  From 1500–1914, more soldiers were killed by typhus than from all the combined [[military]] actions during that time.  It was a disease associated with the crowded conditions of urban poverty and [[refugees]] as well.  Finally, during [[World War I]], governments instituted preventative [[delousing]] measures among the armed forces and other groups, and the disease began to decline.&lt;ref name="USAMRMC"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of [[antibiotic]]s has allowed disease to be controlled within two days of taking a 200&amp;nbsp;mg dose of [[tetracycline]].

===Syphilis===
Syphilis is a [[sexually transmitted disease]] that causes open sores, [[delirium]] and rotting skin, and is characterized by [[genital ulcer]]s.  Syphilis can also do damage to the nervous system, brain and heart.  The disease can be transmitted from mother to child.

The origins of [[syphilis]] are unknown, and some historians argue that it descended from a twenty-thousand-year-old African [[zoonosis]].  Other historians place its emergence in the [[New World]], arguing that the crews of Columbus’s ships first brought the disease to [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt; The first recorded case of syphilis occurred in [[Naples]] in 1495, after [[Charles VIII of France|King Charles VIII]] of France besieged the city of Naples, [[Italy]].  The soldiers, and the prostitutes who followed their camps, came from all corners of Europe.  When they went home, they took the disease with them and spread it across the continent.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

=== Smallpox ===
[[Smallpox]] is a highly contagious disease caused by the [[Variola virus]].  There are four variations of smallpox; variola major, variola minor, haemorrhagic, and malignant, with the most common being variola major and variola minor.  Symptoms of the disease including [[hemorrhaging]], [[blindness]], back ache, [[vomiting]], which generally occur shortly after the 12- to 17-day incubation period.  The virus begins to attack [[skin]] cells, and eventually leads to an eruption of pimples that cover the whole body.  As the disease progresses, the [[pimples]] fill up with pus or merge.  This merging results in a sheet that can detach the bottom layer from the top layer of skin.  The disease is easily transmitted through airborne pathways (coughing, sneezing, and breathing), as well as through contaminated bedding, clothing or other fabrics,

It is believed that smallpox first emerged over 3000 years ago, probably in [[India]] or [[Egypt]].  There have been numerous recorded devastating [[epidemic]]s throughout the world, with high losses of life.

Smallpox was a common disease in Eurasia in the 15th century, and was spread by [[Exploration|explorers]] and invaders.  After Columbus landed on the island of [[Hispaniola]] during his second voyage in 1493, local people started to die of a [[virulent]] [[infection]].  Before the smallpox epidemic started, more than one million indigenous people had lived on the [[island]]; afterward, only ten thousand had survived.&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;

During the 16th century, Spanish soldiers introduced smallpox by contact with natives of the [[Aztec]] capital [[Tenochtitlan]].  A devastating epidemic broke out among the indigenous people, killing thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mariner.org/exploration/index.php?type=explorersection&amp;id=200 |title=The Mariners' Museum &amp;#124; EXPLORATION through the AGES |publisher=Mariner.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, smallpox reached [[Massachusetts]], probably brought by earlier explorers to [[Nova Scotia]], [[Canada]].”&lt;ref name=Altman /&gt;  By 1638 the disease had broken out among people in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  In 1721 people fled the city after an outbreak, but the residents  spread the disease to others throughout the [[thirteen colonies]].  Smallpox broke out in six separate epidemics in the United States through 1968.

The [[smallpox vaccine]] was developed in 1798 by [[Edward Jenner]]. By 1979 the disease had been completely [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradicated]], with no new outbreaks.  The [[WHO]] stopped providing vaccinations and by 1986, vaccination was no longer necessary to anyone in the world except in the event of future outbreak.

=== Leprosy ===
[[Leprosy]], also known as Hansen’s Disease, is caused by a [[bacillus]], ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''.  It is a [[chronic disease]] with an incubation period of up to five years.  Symptoms often include irritation or erosion of the skin, and effects on the [[peripheral nerves]], mucosa of the [[upper respiratory tract]] and eyes.  The most common sign of leprosy are pale reddish spots on the skin that lack sensation.

Leprosy probably originated in [[India]], more than four thousand years ago.  It was prevalent in ancient societies in [[China]], Egypt and India, and was transmitted throughout the world by various traveling groups, including [[Roman Legion]]naires, [[Crusaders]], Spanish [[conquistador]]s, Asian [[seafarer]]s, European colonists, and Arab, African, and American slave traders.  Some historians believe that [[Alexander the Great]]'s troops brought leprosy from India to Europe during the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Leprosy - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwq4ZAH0?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761578788/Leprosy.html |archivedate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of the crusaders and other travelers, leprosy reached [[epidemic]] proportions by the 13th century.

Once detected, leprosy can be cured using multi-drug therapy, composed of two or three antibiotics, depending on the type of leprosy. In 1991 the World Health Assembly began an attempt to eliminate leprosy.  By 2005 116 of 122 countries were reported to be free of leprosy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_20070129/en/ | title=Western Pacific Regional Leprosy Situation in 2005  Fact sheet 28, January 2007 | publisher=WPRO | year=2007 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria===
On Nov. 6, 1880 [[Alphonse Laveran]] discovered that [[malaria]] (then called "Marsh Fever") was a [[protozoa]]n parasite, and that mosquitoes carry and transmit malaria.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Infectious Diseases, Division of Parasitic Diseases. "Lavaran and the Discovery of the Malaria Parasite" [article online] 2004. Available from https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/laveran.htm. Accessed on Nov. 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaria is a [[protozoan]] [[infectious disease]] that is generally transmitted to [[humans]] by mosquitoes between dusk and dawn. The European variety, known as "vivax" after the ''[[Plasmodium vivax]]'' parasite, causes a relatively mild, yet chronically aggravating disease.  The west African variety is caused by the [[sporozoan]] parasite, ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'', and results in a severely debilitating and deadly disease.

Malaria was common in parts of the world where it has now disappeared, as the vast majority of Europe (disease of African descent are particularly diffused in the Empire romain) and North America . In some parts of England, [[mortality rate|mortality]] due to malaria was comparable to that of [[sub-Saharan Africa]] today. Although [[William Shakespeare]] was born at the beginning of a colder period called the "[[Little Ice Age]]", he knew enough ravages of this disease to include in eight parts. Plasmodium vivax lasted until 1958 in the [[polder]]s of Belgium and the Netherlands.
In the 1500s, it was the European settlers and their slaves who probably brought malaria on the American continent (we know that Columbus was suffering from this disease before his arrival in the new land). The Spanish [[Jesuit missionaries]] saw the Indians bordering on Lake Loxa Peru used the [[Cinchona bark]] powder to treat fevers. However, there is no reference to malaria in the medical literature of the Maya or [[Aztecs]]. The use of the bark of the "fever tree" was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries whose Barbabe Cobo who experimented in 1632 and also exports, so that the precious powder s' also called "Jesuit powder" . A study in 2012 of thousands of genetic markers for Plasmodium falciparum samples confirmed the African origin of the parasite in South America (Europeans themselves have been affected by this disease through Africa): it borrowed from the mid-sixteenth century and the mid-nineteenth the two main roads of the slave trade, the first leading to the north of South America (Colombia) by the Spanish, the second most leading south (Brazil) by Portugueses.

Parts of the [[Third World]] are more affected by malaria than the rest of the world. For instance, many inhabitants of sub-Saharan Africa are affected by recurring attacks of malaria throughout their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaplan |first=Robert D. |chapter=The Coming Anarchy |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&amp;pg=PA40 |editor=O’Meara, P. |editor2=Mehlinger, H.D. |editor3=Krain, M. |title=Globalization and the Challenges of a New Century: A Reader |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-21355-6 |pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many areas of Africa, there is limited [[running water]].  The residents' use of wells and [[cistern]]s provides many sites for the breeding of mosquitoes and spread of the disease.  Mosquitoes use areas of [[standing water]] like [[marshes]], [[wetlands]], and water drums to breed.

===Tuberculosis===
The [[bacterium]] that causes [[tuberculosis]], ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'',  is generally spread when an infected person [[cough]]s and another person inhales the bacteria. Once inhaled TB frequently grows in the [[lungs]], but can spread to any part of the body.  Although TB is highly contagious, in most cases the human body is able to fend off the bacteria.  But, TB can remain [[dormancy|dormant]] in the body for years, and become active unexpectedly. If and when the disease does become active in the body, it can multiply rapidly, causing the person to develop many symptoms including cough (sometimes with blood), night sweats, fever, chest pains, loss of appetite and loss of weight. This disease can occur in both adults and children and is especially common among those with weak or undeveloped [[immune system]]s.

Tuberculosis (TB) has been one of history’s greatest killers, taking the lives of over 3 million people annually.  It has been called the "white plague". According to the WHO, approximately fifty percent of people infected with TB today live in [[Asia]].  It is the most prevalent, life-threatening infection among [[AIDS]] patients.  It has increased in areas where HIV [[seroprevalence]] is high.&lt;ref name=TBF&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/20120306_tuberculosis/en/index.html | title=Tuberculosis facts. | publisher=WPRO | date=March 2012 | accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Air travel]] and the other methods of travel which have made global interaction easier, have increased the spread of TB across different societies. Luckily, the [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin|BCG vaccine]] was developed, which prevents TB meningitis and [[miliary TB]] in childhood.  But, the vaccine does not provide substantial protection against the more virulent forms of TB found among adults. Most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The two antibiotics most commonly used are [[rifampicin]] and [[isoniazid]].  There are dangers, however, of a rise of antibiotic-resistant TB.  The TB treatment regimen is lengthy, and difficult for poor and disorganized people to complete, increasing resistance of bacteria.&lt;ref name=TBF /&gt; Antibiotic-resistant TB is also known as "[[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]]." "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" is a pandemic that is on the rise. Patients with MDR-TB are mostly young adults who are not infected with HIV or have other existing illness. Due to the lack of health care infrastructure in underdeveloped countries, there is a debate as to whether treating MDR-TB will be cost effective or not. The reason is the high cost of "second-line" antituberculosis medications. It has been argued that the reason the cost of treating patients with MDR-TB is high is because there has been a shift in focus in the medical field, in particular the rise of AIDS, which is now the world's leading infectious cause of death. Nonetheless, it is still important to put in the effort to help and treat patients with "multidrug-resistant tuberculosis" in poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Major Infectious Diseases in the World — To Treat or Not to Treat? | author=Farmer, P. | journal=The New England Journal of Medicine | year=2001 | month=| volume=345 | issue=3|pages=208–210 | doi=10.1056/nejm200107193450310 | pmid=11463018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HIV/AIDS===
[[HIV and AIDS]] are among the newest and deadliest diseases. According to the [[World Health Organization]], it is unknown where the [[HIV]] [[virus]] originated, but it appeared to move from animals to humans.  It may have been isolated within many groups throughout the world.  It is believed that HIV arose from another, less harmful virus, that mutated and became more virulent.  The first two AIDS/HIV cases were detected in 1981.  As of 2013, an estimated 1.3 million persons in the [[United States]] were living with HIV or AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210000903/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/International-statistics.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; almost 110,000 in the UK &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212121444/http://www.nat.org.uk/HIV-in-the-UK/HIV-Statistics/Latest-UK-statistics/People-with-HIV-in-UK.aspx |archivedate=2015-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 35 million people worldwide are living with HIV”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/hiv/data/epi_core_dec2014.png?ua=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite efforts in numerous countries, awareness and prevention programs have not been effective enough to reduce the numbers of new HIV cases in many parts of the world, where it is associated with high mobility of men, poverty and sexual mores among certain populations.  Uganda has had an effective program, however. Even in countries where the epidemic has a very high impact, such as Swaziland and South Africa, a large proportion of the population do not believe they are at risk of becoming infected. Even in countries such as the UK, there is no significant decline in certain at-risk communities. 2014 saw the greatest number of new diagnoses in gay men, the equivalent of nine being diagnosed a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nat.org.uk/Media-and-Blog/Press-Releases/2014/November/PHE_Stat_Gay_Men_Stats.aspx#sthash.pgSuiy7L.dpuf | title=Press Releases &amp;#124; National AIDS Trust - NAT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, HIV prevention methods focused primarily on preventing the sexual transmission of HIV through behaviour change. The ABC Approach - "Abstinence, Be faithful, Use a Condom". However, by the mid-2000s, it became evident that effective HIV prevention requires more than that and that interventions need to take into account underlying socio-cultural, economic, political, legal and other contextual factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avert.org/hiv-prevention-programmes.htm#sthash.8IYVPGF1.dpuf | title=HIV prevention programmes overview| date=2015-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ebola===
{{main|2014 West Africa Ebola virus outbreak}}
The [[Ebola]] outbreak, which was the 26th outbreak since 1976, started in [[Guinea]] in March 2014. The [[WHO]] warned that the number of [[Ebola]] patients could rise to 20,000, and said that it used $489m (£294m) to contain Ebola within six to nine months.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/28/ebola-cases-rise-20000-world-health-organisation-west-africa-death-toll Ebola cases in west Africa could rise to 20,000 says WHO] Lisa O'Carroll, Society, theguardian, 28 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak was accelerating. [[Medecins sans Frontieres]] has just opened a new Ebola hospital in [[Monrovia]], and after one week it is already a capacity of 120 patients. It said that the number of patients seeking treatment at its new Monrovia centre was increasing faster than they could handle both in terms of the number of beds and the capacity of the staff, adding that it was struggling to cope with the caseload in the Liberian capital. Lindis Hurum, MSF's emergency coordinator in Monrovia, said that it was humanitarian emergency and they needed a full-scale humanitarian response.&lt;ref name=guardian2014aug28EO /&gt; [[Brice de la Vinge]], MSF director of operations, said that it was not until five months after the declaration of the Ebola outbreak that serious discussions started about international leadership and coordination, and said that it was not acceptable.

===Leptospirosis===
[[Leptospirosis]], also known as '''field fever''' is an infection caused by ''Leptospira''. Symptoms can range from none to mild such as headaches, muscle pains, and fevers; to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis. ''Leptospira'' is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, most commonly by rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or by water or soil containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, eyes, mouth, or nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slack A | year = 2010 | title = Leptospirosis | url = | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 495–8 | pmid = 20628664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The countries with the highest reported incidence are located in the Asia-Pacific region (Seychelles, India, Sri Lanka and Thailand) with incidence rates over 10 per 1000,000 people s well as in Latin America and the Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Jamaica, El Salvador, Uruguay, Cuba, Nicaragua and Costa Rica)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pappas G, Papadimitriou P, Siozopoulou V, Christou L, Akritidis N | year = 2008 | title = The globalization of leptospirosis: worldwide incidence trends | url = | journal = Int J Infect Dis | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 351–357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rise in global travel and eco-tourism &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leptospirosis, Challenge Eco | year = 2000 | title = participants | url = | journal = Commun Dis Rep CDR Wkly | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has led to dramatic changes in the epidemiology of leptospirosis, and travelers from around the world have become exposed to the threat of leptospirosis. Despite decreasing prevalence of leptospirosis in endemic regions, previously non-endemic countries are now reporting increasing numbers of cases due to recreational exposure &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wasinski B, Dutkiewicz J | year = 2013 | title = Leptospirosis–current risk factors connected with human activity and the environment | url = | journal = Ann Agric Environ Med | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 239–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; International travelers engaged in adventure sports are directly exposed to numerous infectious agents in the environment and now comprise a growing proportion of cases worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bandara Medhani, Ananda Mahesha, Wickramage Kolitha, Berger Elisabeth, Agampodi Suneth | year = 2014 | title = Globalization of leptospirosis through travel and migration | url = | journal = Globalization and Health | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 61 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-communicable disease==

[[Globalization]] can benefit people with [[non-communicable diseases]] such as heart problems or mental health problems. Global trade and rules set forth by the [[World Trade Organization]] can actually benefit the health of people by making their incomes higher, allowing them to afford better health care. While it has to be admitted making many non-communicable diseases more likely as well. Also the national income of a country, mostly obtained by trading on the global market, is important because it dictates how much a government spends on health care for its citizens. It also has to be acknowledged that an expansion in the definition of disease often accompanies development, so the net effect is not clearly beneficial due to this and other effects of increased affluence. Metabolic syndrome is one obvious example. Although poorer countries have not yet experienced this and are still suffering from diseases listed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Beaglehole R, Yach D |title=Globalisation and the prevention and control of non-communicable disease: the neglected chronic diseases of adults |journal=Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9387 |pages=903–8 |date=September 2003 |pmid=13678979 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14335-8 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(03)14335-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Granule cell dispersion''' is one of the abnormal structural changes that has been shown in brains of patients with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]]. It has also been shown in different animal models, such as the [[kainic acid]] model,&lt;ref name="Murphy BL 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Brian L|author2=Rylon D. Hofacer |author3=Christian N Faulkner |author4=Andreas W Loepke |author5=Steve C Danzer |title=Abnormalities of granule cell dendritic structure are a prominent feature of the intrahippocampal kainic acid model of epilepsy despite reduced post-injury neurogenesis|journal=Epilepsia|date=May 2012|volume=53|issue=5|pages=908–921|doi=10.1111/j.1528-1167.2012.03463.x|pmid=22533643 |pmc=3340618}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[pilocarpine]] model,&lt;ref name="Mello LE (1)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mello|first=L |author2=Cavalheiro, E. |author3=Tan, A. |author4=Pretorius, J. |author5=Babb, T. |author6=Finch, D.|title=Granule cell dispersion in relation to mossy fiber sprouting, hippocampal cell loss, silent period and seizure frequency in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy|journal=Epilepsy resesarch|year=1992|volume=9|pages=51–60|pmid=1285914}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kindling model]]. But granule cell dispersion was not found by using perforant pathway stimulation.&lt;ref name="Sloviter 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sloviter|first=Robert S|author2=Friederike Kienzler |author3=Braxton A. Norwood |title=Hippocampal injury, atrophy, synaptic reorganization, and epileptogenesis after perforant pathway stimulation-induced status epilepticus in the mouse|journal=Journal of Comparative Neurology|date=10 July 2009|volume=515|issue=2|pages=181–196|doi=10.1002/cne.22059|pmid=19412934|pmc=2705826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was first described by Houser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houser|first=Carolyn R|title=Granule cell dispersion in the dentate gyrus of humans with temporal lobe epilepsy.|journal=Brain Research|date=December 1990|volume=535|issue=2|pages=195–204|pmid=1705855|doi=10.1016/0006-8993(90)91601-c}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a normal situation, the granule cells in [[dentate gyrus]] should be tightly packed. But in granule cell dispersion, the compact formation was lost, and the axons need to extend longer to reach the neighboring granule cells.

==Mechanism of formation==
There are currently two hypotheses for the mechanism. It might be a consequence of a migration disorder, and the first hypothesis considers an initial injury that release toxin(s) that affect the normal [[migration of granule cells]].  The second hypothesis concerns the role of reelin (see below).

===Reelin role in temporal lobe epilepsy===
[[Reelin]] is required for normal neuronal lamination humans, and the lack of this expression can lead to migration defect associated with temporal lobe epilepsy&lt;ref name="Haas 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hass|first=Carola A|author2=Oliver Dudeck |author3=Matthias Kirsch |author4=Csaba Huszka |author5=Gunda Kann |author6=Stefan Pollak |author7=Josef Zentner |author8=Michael Frotscher |title=Role for Reelin in the Development of Granule Cell Dispersion in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=15 July 2002|volume=22|issue=14|pages=5797–5802|pmid=12122039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has researched and written widely on religious matters, from [[Celtic Christianity]] to the future of [[spirituality]] in Britain. In addition, he has published works on the subjects of [[hymnody]], monarchy, the [[Victorian era]], [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[musical theatre]].

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Ian Bradley was born in [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], on [[Whit Sunday]] 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studia.no/vare.php?ean=9780826482822 Daily Telegraph Book of Hymns - Studia AS - Bokhandel]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the southeast of England and was educated at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[New College, Oxford]], from which he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|first-class honours degree]] in modern history.  He remained at [[Oxford|University of Oxford]] to complete a [[doctoral thesis]] on religion and politics in early nineteenth-century Britain, earning his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree.

===Career===
Bradley subsequently worked in radio and television production with the [[BBC]]. He spent five years on the staff of ''[[The Times]]'' (and was a features writer for ''The Times'' for eight years) and then combined freelance writing with teaching at [[Cranleigh School]] in [[Surrey]]. Following further study at the [[University of St Andrews]], from which he graduated with a first-class honours [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] degree in [[theology]], Bradley was ordained to the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]] and appointed Head of Religious Broadcasting for [[BBC Scotland]]. He has lived in Scotland since 1985. He sat on the committee that drafted the [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Church Hymnary, fourth edition (2005)|Church of Scotland's Hymnary (Fourth Edition)]], which was published in 2005. Bradley has taught in the areas of Christianity in contemporary Britain; hymnody, liturgy and worship; monarchy, church and state; and the theology of [[musical theatre]]. According to his profile in his 1997 book ''Abide with Me'', he was one of the first lecturers to teach an honors course on hymnology at a British University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37548665|title=Abide With Me: The World of Victorian Hymns|last=Ian|first=Bradley|date=1997|publisher=SCM Press|isbn=033402692X|location=London|oclc=37548665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having lectured on [[church history]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] for many years, Bradley was appointed to a position at the University of St Andrews in 1998, where he was later awarded a Chair in Cultural and Spiritual History in its School of Divinity, where he was previously Principal of [[St Mary's College, St Andrews]]. He retired in 2017. He is also associate minister of Holy Trinity Church, St Andrews, and honorary Church of Scotland chaplain for the university.&lt;ref name=UnivBioPage/&gt;

As a journalist, Bradley contributes frequently to ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Tablet]]'' and ''[[Life and Work (magazine)|Life and Work]]'' as well as often appearing on [[television]] and [[BBC Radio 4]]. Bradley frequently writes, broadcasts and lectures about [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and has spoken numerous times at the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]]s in [[Buxton]] and [[Harrogate]], England. He performs regularly with the University of St Andrews Gilbert and Sullivan Society, of which he is honorary life president. He is the author of more than 30 books.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.penguin.co.nz/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000004855,00.html Penguin Group Authors - New Zealand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075652/http://www.penguin.co.nz/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000004855,00.html |date=27 September 2007 }}.

'''Intimism''' ({{Lang-fr|intimisme}}) was an artistic movement in late 19th-century and early 20th-century that involved the depiction of banal yet highly personal domestic scenes, particularly those within domestic interiors. Intimism was most notably practiced by [[Édouard Vuillard]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] after the 1899 disbandment of [[Les Nabis|the Nabis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Intimism|title=Intimism {{!}} art|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dcpt/hd_dcpt.htm|title=The Nabis and Decorative Painting|last=|first=|date=|website=www.metmuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Breakfast,_Edouard_Vuillard,_1894.jpg|thumb|Breakfast, Edouard Vuillard, 1894]]French art critic [[Camille Mauclair]] defined Intimism as:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great French Painters and the Evolution of French Painting from 1830 to the Present Day|last=Mauclair|first=Camille|publisher=Duckworth|year=1903|isbn=|location=|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has served as a consultant on over 1,000 film scripts over the past three decades, and is also known for the [[screenwriting software]] program Blockbuster (originally "Storyline Pro").

Truby argues that most [[screenwriting guru|teachers of screenwriting]] emphasize inner transformation of the characters but not the moral effect their actions have on others. He is critical of [[Syd Field|Syd Field's]] [[Screenwriting theories|three-act “Paradigm”]] and has instead crafted his own 22-step outline. Truby's first book ''The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller'' was published in October, 2007 by [[Faber and Faber]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479518 The Anatomy of Story: 22 Steps to Becoming a Master Storyteller] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vOgcUsML?url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0865479518 |date=31 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screenwriting career==
In the 1980s, Truby received his first credits, writing three episodes of [[21 Jump Street]]. He later received a co-writer credit on the 2011 Disney/BBC film ''[[African Cats]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0991399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5063">'''Les Automatistes''' were a group of [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] artistic dissidents from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The movement was founded in the early 1940s by painter [[Paul-Émile Borduas]]. Les Automatistes were so called because they were influenced by [[Surrealism]] and its theory of [[surrealist automatism|automatism]]. Members included [[Marcel Barbeau]], [[Roger Fauteux]], [[Claude Gauvreau]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[Pierre Gauvreau]], [[Fernand Leduc]], [[Jean-Paul Mousseau]], and [[Marcelle Ferron]] and [[Françoise Sullivan]]. 

The movement may have begun with an exhibition Borduas gave in Montreal in 1942. However, les Automatistes were soon being exhibited in [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]] also. Though it began as a visual arts group, it also spread to other forms of expression, such as drama, poetry and dance. The title les Automatistes came from journalist [[Tancrède Marcil]] Jr., in a review of their second exhibit in Montreal (February 15 to March 1, 1947), which appeared in ''Le Quartier Latin'' (the [[Université de Montréal]]'s student journal).

In 1948 [[Paul-Émile Borduas|Borduas]] published a collective [[manifesto]] called the [[Refus global]], an important document in the cultural history of Quebec and a declaration of artistic independence and the need for expressive freedoms. Its denunciation of the Catholic Church's authority was particularly scandalous and resulted in the group's public humiliation. This ultimately lead to a kind of martyrdom but was initially devastating. Although the group dispersed soon after the manifesto was published, the movement continues to have influence, and may be considered a forerunner of the [[Quiet Revolution]]. 

Alongside [[Lyrical abstraction|Lyrical Abstract]] painters in France, the Automatistes favoured a fluid, painterly technique over the comparatively reserved, hard-edge abstraction so popular in the U.S. and Eastern Europe at the time. Much like a nonfigurative [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], they were looking to create a distinctively Canadian artistic identity. Heavily influenced by Surrealist manifestos and poetry, their work was largely stream-of-consciousness inspired, believing this to be a truer means of communicating subconscious emotions and sensory experiences; they wanted to be liberated from intention, reason, and any kind of structure, in order to communicate a universal human experience without bias. This resulted in increasingly crude or intuitive methods such as applying paint with palette knives and fingers and painting blindfolded, their efforts contradicting their claims of working without intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Automatiste Revolution|last = Nasgaard|first = Roald|publisher = D&amp;M Publishers Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Vancouver, BC|pages = |first2 = Ray|last2 = Ellenwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In 1954, the Automatistes were the subject of the NFB/CBC documentary series ''[[On the Spot (Canadian TV series)|On the Spot]]'' in an episode entitled ''Artist in Montreal.''&lt;ref name="Ohayon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2010/04/14/on-the-spot-the-nfb-in-the-early-days-of-television/|title=On the Spot: The NFB in the early days of television|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|date=April 14, 2010|work=NFB.ca|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marmotinto''''' is the art of creating pictures using coloured [[sand]] or [[marble]] dust and otherwise known as [[sand painting]].

Originating in Europe, and probably based on the Japanese craft of ''[[bonseki]]'' (aka 'tray-painting'), ''marmotinto'' was fleetingly popular in England following a 1783 dinner party given by [[George III]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E88AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=marmotinto&amp;source=web&amp;ots=dtO9Gcevrf&amp;sig=TMGohrLQRBZTcaqs7F7cM2o4MFM The Mechanics' Magazine, Museum, Register, Journal, and Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt; at Windsor Castle who was taken with a display of unfixed coloured sands, sugars and marble dust arranged under glass upon the surface of the dinner table in decorative patterns and including fruit and flowers, and exotic birds which was executed by the Bavarian table-decker [[Benjamin Zobel]] (Memmingen, 21 September 1762 - London, 24 October 1830),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=G3WN9sqAOHYC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=marmotinto&amp;source=web&amp;ots=ijXm-X-VQd&amp;sig=B3uXbIeAhwrM0vZdOEQiDGKbT7I Dictionary of artists]&lt;/ref&gt; a friend of [[George Morland]], a painter prominent in the "Isle of Wight School". The King and his courtiers was so impressed with the resulting picture, it was suggested that Zobel find a way to make his compositions permanent and hence the craft of ''marmotinto'' or sandpainting was born and proved most successful under the patronage of various members of the royal household including the then Duke of York. 

[[Woburn Abbey]] in Bedford, England possesses a fine example of the table deckers' craft in the form of an ornate folding room screen with three panels, decorated with sand pictures protected by glass. The centre one has five spaces for sweetmeat pyramid dishes while the two side leaves of the screen have three spaces for fruit trays. There are four sand pictures in each corner of the side panels of the screen, featuring 18th-century pastoral scenes, while the remaining areas of the screen are decorated with butterflies, doves, fruit, flowers, etc.  The screen would be laid upon the surface of a side table where it doubled as a serving base for elaborate porcelain dishes and glass trays containing fruits, bonbons and sweetmeats, from which the hosts and their guests could help themselves while socializing or stretching their legs between the multiple courses being served on the main table in the dining hall. This screen is believed to be the work of F. Schweikhardt, Zobel's predecessor at Windsor who specialised in still-life studies in the style of the Dutch painter Jan van Huysum.


Later the craft became popular in the early 19th century as the tourist industry began to develop on the [[Isle of Wight]] particularly at [[Alum Bay]] where coloured sands were readily available to the visitors should they wish to try their hand at creating their own souvenirs when they disembarked directly onto the beach from the decks of mainland steamers. The locals soon realised an opportunity to develop and market small framed sand pictures and also compressed sand patterns inside glass jars to supplement their meagre income. There are some examples of Alum Bay sand pictures at [[Osborne House]] and [[Carisbrook Castle]] while at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the late Queen Mary's collection of Georgian sandpaintings may be viewed by request.

Although ''marmotinto'' using coloured sands and marble dust was popular across England and on the continent for a while, it declined after an initial fashionable period. The art saw a comeback in the 20th century using natural coloured sands, supplemented by discarded, recycled and found materials.

'''Music semantics''' refers to the ability of [[music]] to convey [[semantic]] meaning. Semantics are a key feature of [[language]], and whether music shares some of the same ability to [[Priming (psychology)|prime]] and convey meaning has been the subject of recent study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|last=Koelsch| first=S|title=Music, language and meaning: brain signatures of semantic processing|journal=Nature Neuroscience|doi=10.1038/nn1197|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary antecedents==

Primate vocalizations are mainly determined by music-like features (such as [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[Amplitude modulation|amplitude]]-and [[Frequency modulation|frequency-modulations]], [[timbre]] and [[rhythm]]), and it is assumed that human musical abilities played a key [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetical]] part in the [[Origin of language|evolution of language]]. Likewise, it is assumed that, [[Ontogeny|ontogenetically]], infants’ first steps into language are based on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] information, and that musical communication in [[early childhood]] (such as maternal music) has a major role for emotional, cognitive and social development of children. The music faculty is in some respects unique to the human species; only humans [[Composer|compose]] music, learn to play [[musical instrument]]s and play instruments cooperatively together in groups. Playing a musical instrument in a group is a tremendously demanding task for the human [[brain]] that potentially engages all cognitive processes that we are aware of. It involves [[perception]], action, [[learning]], [[memory]], [[emotion]], etc., making music an ideal tool to investigate human [[cognition]] and the underlying brain mechanisms. The relatively young discipline of '[[neurocognition]] of music' includes a wide field of [[Behavioral neuroscience|biopsychological]] research, beginning with the investigation of [[psychoacoustics]] and the [[neural coding]] of sounds, and ending with brain functions underlying cognition and emotion during the perception and production of highly complex musical information.

==Semantic priming effect==
A sentence such as ''Sissy sings a song'' disburdens the neural processing of semantically related words like music, whereas it does not alleviate processing of semantically unrelated words like carpet. This effect is known as the semantic [[Priming (psychology)|priming]] effect; it refers to the highly consistent processing advantage seen for words that are preceded by a semantically related context. This semantic processing effect is [[Electrophysiology|electrophysically]] reflected by the [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] component of [[Event-related potential|event related potential (ERP)]] measurements. The N400 is a negative polarity ERP component that is maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites. It emerges at around 250 ms after the onset of word stimulation and reaches is maximal amplitude at about 400 ms. When a word is preceded by a semantic context, the amplitude of the N400 is inversely related to the degree of semantic congruousness between the word and is preceding semantic context. The processing of almost any type of semantically meaningful information seems to be associated with an N400 effect (Kutas, M. ''et al.'': Electrophysiology reveals semantic memory use in language comprehension, Trends Cogn. Sci., 2000).

Semantic information is clearly a key feature of language, but is this kind of information also an important aspect of music?

Most [[Music theory|music theorists]] posit at least four different aspects of musical meaning:

# meaning that emerges from a connection across different [[Frame of reference|frames of reference]] suggested by common patterns or forms (sound patterns in terms of pitch, [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[tempo]], timbre etc. that resemble features of objects like rushing water, for example)
# meaning that arises from the suggestion of a particular [[Mood (psychology)|mood]]
# meaning that results from extra-musical associations ([[national anthem]], for example)
# meaning that can be attributed to the interplay of formal structures in creating patterns of tension and resolution.

Most [[Linguistics|linguists]], however, would reject the notion that music can transfer specific semantic concepts (Pinker, Norton, New York 1997, How the Mind Works). Though the study of Koelsch et al. in 2004 could provide strong behavioural and electrophysiological evidence that music is able to transfer semantic information.

Intuitively, it seems plausible that certain passages of [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]´s ''[[The Planets]]'' or [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]´s [[Symphonies (Beethoven)|symphonies]] prime the word "hero", rather than the word "flea".
As primes Koelsch et al., as already mentioned above, used sentences and musical excerpts that were, with respect to their meaning, either related or unrelated to a target word. Half of the targets were abstract, the other half were concrete words. Most of the stimuli that primed concrete words resembled sounds (e.g., bird) or qualities of objects (e.g., low tones associated with basement or ascending pitch steps associated with staircase). Some musical stimuli (especially those used as primes for abstract words) resembled prosodic and possibly gestural cues that can be associated with particular words (e.g., sigh, consolation). Other stimuli presented stereotypic musical forms or styles that are commonly associated with particular words (e.g., a church anthem and the word devotion).

Importantly, participants were not familiar with the musical excerpts, so meaning could not simply be ascribed by extra-musical associations that had an explicit, direct link to language (such as titles or lyrics). As priming of words could not rely on direct associations between musical primes and target words, Koelsch et al. were enabled to investigate whether the N400 can also be elicited by stimuli that are not directly linked to language.

Behaviourally, subjects categorized 92% of the target words correctly when target words were presented after a sentence. When target words were preceded by musical excerpts, 80% of the targets were categorized correctly. Further behavioural data was collected by a pre-experiment in which the subjects had to rate the semantic relatedness between prime and target words by using a scale ranging from -5 to +5, and an additional experiment in which the subjects were instructed to choose the word semantically most closely related to the prime out of a five-word list. The Pre-experiment and the additional experiment could maintain the results of the behavioural performance during the first [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] experiment.

Semantic processing was measured using EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram). Target words elicited an N400 when elicited after semantically unrelated sentences. Likewise, an N400 effect was elicited when target words were preceded by semantically unrelated musical excerpts, showing that music can transfer semantically meaningful information by priming representations of meaningful concepts. The ERPs of the target words showed, as expected, larger N400s when the targets were presented after semantically unrelated sentences compared to those after semantically related sentences. As when preceded by the sentences, the target words also elicited larger N400s when presented after an unrelated musical excerpt compared to when presented after a related excerpt. In both, language and music, both concrete and abstract target words elicited significant N400 effects.

The N400 effect (that means, the effect of unprimed versus primed target words) did not differ between the language domain (sentences followed by target words) and the music domain (musical excerpts followed by target words), concerning [[amplitude]], [[Latency (audio)|latency]] or scalp distribution. In both domains, a bilateral N400 was maximal around 410ms over centro-parietal [[electrode]] sites.
The N400 effects did not differ between the prime-target pairs with and without balanced content, neither in the language nor in the music domain. This findings rules out the possibility that the musical excerpts merely primed an emotional state that was (in)consistent with the emotional content of the target word.

The sources of electric brain activity underlying the N400 effect did not statistically differ between the language and the music domain, neither with respect to locations, nor with respect to orientations, strengths, time point of maximum or explanation of variance. The source analysis of the N400 effect indicated generators located in the posterior portion of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG, Brodmann´s area 21/37), quite close to the superior temporal sulcus. This localization concurs with numerous studies on the functional [[neuroanatomy]] of semantic processes at the level of both words and sentences.

[[Mass media]] are the means through which information is transmitted to a large audience. This includes newspapers, television, radio, and more recently the Internet. Those who provide news and information, and the outlets for which they work, are known as the '''news media'''.

==Structure of US news media==

===Public sector news media===
The '''[[Public Broadcasting Service]]''' ('''PBS''') is the primary [[non-profit]] [[television]] service, with 349 member public broadcasters.  News and public affairs programs include ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'', and ''[[Washington Week]]''.  In September 2012, PBS rated 88% above CNN in public affairs programming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/about/background/|title=Overview - About PBS - PBS About|website=Overview - About PBS - PBS About}}&lt;/ref&gt; placing it competitively with cable news outlets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2012/10/01/cable-news-ratings-for-friday-september-28-2012/150783/|title=Page not found – TV By The Numbers by zap2it.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but far behind private broadcasters ABC, CBS, and NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/evening-news-ratings-week-of-september-24_b148194|title=Evening News Ratings: Week of September 24|website=www.mediabistro.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PBS does not produce [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour news]], but some member stations carry [[MHz WorldView]], [[NHK World]], or [[PBS World|World]] as a [[digital subchannel]].

'''[[National Public Radio]]'''  ('''NPR''') is the primary non-profit [[radio]] service, offered by over 900 stations.  Its news programming includes ''[[All Things Considered]]'' and ''[[Morning Edition]]''.

PBS and NPR are funded primarily by member contributions and corporate underwriters, with a relatively small amount of government contributions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.denverpost.com/politics-national/2012/10/big-bird-mitt-romney-and-how-pbs-is-actually-funded/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other national public television program distributors include [[American Public Television]] and NETA. Distributors of radio programs include [[American Public Media]], [[Pacifica Radio]], [[Public Radio International]], and [[Public Radio Exchange]].

==Agenda-setting==
An important role which is often ascribed to the media is that of agenda-setter. Georgetown University professor Gary Wasserman describes this as "putting together an agenda of national priorities&amp;nbsp;— what should be taken seriously, what lightly, what not at all". Wasserman calls this "the most important political function the media perform."&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Basics of American Politics (London, Longman, 2003) p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agenda-setting theory]] was proposed by McCombs and Shaw in the 1970s and suggests that the public agenda is dictated by the media agenda.

===Agenda-setting in domestic politics===
In a commercialized media context, the media can often not afford to ignore an important issue which another television station, newspaper, or radio station is willing to pick up. The media may be able to create new issues by reporting and should that should be considered seriously. Also, they can obscure issues by reporting through negligence and distraction. If persons are affected by high crime rates, or unemployment, for instance, the media can reduce the time they report on potential solutions, the nature of [[class-based society]] or other related issues. They can reduce the direct awareness of these problems on the lives of the public. The media can make the problem in essence "go away" by obfuscating it. The public can go away to another media source, so it is in the media's commercial interest to try to find an agenda which corresponds as closely as possible to peoples’ desires. They may not be entirely successful, but the agenda-setting potential of the media is considerably limited by the competition for viewers' interest, readers and listeners. It is difficult to see, for instance, how an issue which is a major story to one television station could be ignored by other television stations.

Different US media sources tend to identify the same major stories in domestic politics, which strongly implies that the media are prioritizing issues according to an exogenous set of criteria.

===Agenda-setting in foreign policy===
One way in which the media could set the agenda is if it is in an area in which very few Americans have direct experience of the issues. This applies to foreign policy. When American military personnel are involved, the media needs to report because the personnel are related to the American public. The media is also likely to have an interest in reporting issues with major direct effects on American workers, such as major trade agreements with Mexico. In other cases, it is difficult to see how the media can be prevented{{clarify|date=March 2009}} from setting the foreign policy agenda.

McKay lists as one of the three main distortions of information by the media "Placing high priority on American news to the detriment of foreign news. And when the US is engaged in military action abroad, this 'foreign news' crowds out other foreign news".&lt;ref&gt;McKay, American Politics &amp; Society (Oxford, Blackwell, 2005) pg 144&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horse race approach to political campaign coverage===
American news media are more obsessed than ever with the horse-race aspects of the presidential campaign, according to a new study. Coverage of the political campaigns have been less reflective on the issues that matter to voters, and instead have primarily focused on campaign tactics and strategy, according to a report conducted jointly by the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]], part of the [[Pew Research Center]], and the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]] at the [[Kennedy School of Harvard University]], which examined 1,742 stories that appeared from January through May 2007 in 48 news outlets. Almost two-thirds of all stories in US news media, including print, television, radio and online, focused on the political aspects of the campaign, while only one percent focused on the candidates’ public records. Only 12 percent of stories seemed relevant to voters’ decision-making; the rest were more about tactics and strategy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;"Study: Media Focused On Tactics Not Issues", October 29, 2007, https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/business/media/29coverage.html also archived at: http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/10/29/4880/&lt;/ref&gt;

The proportion of horse-race stories has gotten worse over time. Horse-race coverage has accounted for 63 percent of reports this year (2007) compared with what the study said was about 55 percent in 2000 and 2004. “If American politics is changing,” the study concluded, “the style and approach of the American press does not appear to be changing with it.”

The study found that the US news media deprive the American public of what Americans say they want: voters are eager to know more about the candidates’ positions on issues and their personal backgrounds, more about lesser-known candidates and more about debates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Commentators have pointed out that when covering election campaigns news media often emphasize trivial facts about the candidates but more rarely provide the candidates' specific public stances on issues that matter to voters.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, July 30, 2004, Paul Krugman, "Triumph of the Trivial," https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4DA113DF933A05754C0A9629C8B63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Object literacy''' is a relatively new term that has grown out of Object Based Learning (OBL), which has long been a fundamental part of museum and library work. The increasing availability of digital images and texts makes objects more accessible than ever. Now that the objects and texts are more available, there is an increasing interest in the physicality of the object or text, and a growing understanding of the need to understand objects and texts  in the fullest, most comprehensive context.

== Definitions of Object Literacy ==
* "Object literacy is a special skill gained through the process of discovery and discussion about original objects. It is a skill which, like others, must be learned. Museums have original objects, artifacts, or works of art. Therefore, museums are logical places in which to teach people to become object literate." - Sally Leahy (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Sally Leahy, “Object Literacy,” The Docent Educator 4.3 (Spring 1995): 17. http://www.museum-ed.org/object-literacy/ - retrieved 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Object literacy is also seen as "a subset of [[visual literacy]], leading to a new brand of museum literacy." - Carin Jacobs (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Carin Jacobs, "Beyond the field trip: museum literacy and higher education", ''Museum Management and Curatorship'', Vol. 24, No. 1, March 2009, 5�27 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09647770902731585 - retrieved 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Object literacy recognises "the current trend for printed material and text as a visual medium” in which people “study ways in which the physical aspects of rare books [and other objects] contribute to the understanding the text”.&lt;ref&gt;Tabitha Tuckett and Elizabeth Lawes, "Object literacy at University College London Library Services", ''Art Libraries Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 2 (Information Literacy in UK and US Art Libraries), April 2017 , pp. 99-106.   https://doi.org/10.1017/alj.2017.13 - Retrieved 25 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent projects relating to Object Literacy ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2039">An '''ordinary law''' is a normal [[law]], generally distinguished from a [[constitutional law]], [[organic law]], or other similar law. Typically, ordinary laws are subordinate to constitutional and organic laws, and are more easily changed than constitutional or organic laws, though that should not be assumed to be the case in all jurisdictions. (For example, the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] has ruled that Spain's [[Organic Law (Spain)|Organic Laws]] are not hierarchically superior to ordinary laws, but simply apply to different matters.&lt;ref&gt;Sentencia de 13 de febrero de 1981, Tribunal Constitucional de España&lt;/ref&gt;) Ordinary laws often govern areas beyond the scope of constitutional or organic laws.

Normally, in a democracy, an ordinary law must first obtain a [[majority|simple majority]] of a [[congress]], [[parliament]], or other legislature, and then be signed into law by the representative of [[executive power]]. The process leading to a legislative vote may vary vastly from one jurisdiction to another: the process may be initiated by either house of a [[bicameral legislature]] or from the sole house of a [[unicameral legislature]]; from the [[head of government]] or [[head of state]]; or by popular [[initiative]]. Different jurisdictions may allow ordinary laws to be proposed by one or all of these means, and may have restrictions on which body may take the initiative for certain types of laws (for example, in some bicameral systems, tax-related laws must begin in the lower chamber of the legislature). In some jurisdictions, the legislature has a means to override an executive [[veto]] by a [[supermajority]], or the voting populace have the means to override a law by a [[referendum]].

Under [[federalism|federal]] systems, ordinary laws may be created at the level of a [[sovereign state]] but also by its constituent components: for example, by [[states of the United States]] or [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] of [[Spain]].

'''Paramatman''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परमात्मन्, [[IAST]]: Paramātmāṇ) or '''Paramātmā''' is the Absolute [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Supreme self) in [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] philosophies in the [[Hindu]] theology. The Paramatman is the “Primordial Self” or the “Self Beyond” who is spiritually practically identical with the Absolute, identical with the [[Brahman]]. Selflessness is the attribute of Paramatman, where all personality/individuality vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Occult Glossary:A Comendium of Oriental and Theosophical Terms|author=T. Depurucker|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=130|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eRztON94euYC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word stem ''paramātma'' (परमात्मन्, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmən|}}, its nominative singular being ''paramātmā'' — परमात्मा, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmaː|}}) is formed from two words, ''parama'', meaning "supreme" or "highest", and ''ātma'', which means individual self.

The word “[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]” generally denotes the Individual Self, but by the word “Paramatman” which word also expresses Boundless Life, Boundless Consciousness, Boundless Substance in Boundless Space, is meant the Atman of all atmans or the Supreme Self or the Universal Self. The word “Atman” which literally means non-darkness or light, is Brahman the subtlest indestructible Divine existence. The word “Paramatman” refers to the Creator all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atman and Paramatman|url=http://autobiography.swami.center.org/atman-and-paramatman.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Jain theology==
{{main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], each atman or individual self is a potential Paramatman or God, both are essentially the same. It remains as atman only because of its binding [[karma|"karmic"]] limitations, until such time as those limitations are removed. As Paramatman, the atman represents the ultimate point of spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=245|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgNHE-48jNcC&amp;pg=PA245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Jain [[mysticism]] centers around Atman and Paramatman because it believes in the existence of soul, in Jainism, which accepts neither [[Vedic]] authority nor [[Monism]], all enlightened souls are referred to as Paramatman and regarded as gods. Jainism honours the soul of each man as its own eternally distinct [[Messiah|savior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The World’s Great Religions:An Anthology of Sacred Texts|author=Selwyn Gurney Champion|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=149|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wEjIX4FldtkC&amp;pg=PA149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Paramatman of Jainism is unable to create and govern the world, there is no place of God as a creator and bestower of fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Jaina Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|author=Arvind Sharma|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |p=4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BtbbLjvTkGMC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Buddhism==

Buddhism rejects a metaphysics of "ground" such as the paramatman.

==Description of Paramatman in the Upanishads==

The sage of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.4.2, though not using the word “Paramatman”, explains that at the time of release the portion (aspect) of the Paramatman and the portion (aspect) of the [[Jiva]] presiding in the right eye become unified with the Paramatman and the Jiva presiding in the heart, then the Jiva does not see, smell, taste, speak, hear, feel, touch and know; when Paramatman goes out, the Chief [[Prana]] goes out after Him, followed by the Lower Prana. Paramatman goes out riding on the Jiva following consciousness and work, knowledge of former life or natural capacity. In the [[Prashna Upanishad]] IV.11 the word “Atman” cannot refer to Jiva because the Jiva cannot of its own accord throw off its body or understand avidya, therefore, it refers to Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol. 15.

==Parable of the Two Birds==

The word, Paramatman, is not to be found in the [[Rig Veda]] but through allusion referring to Paramatman as Isha. This distinction is made because all of its mantras which in the form of prayers are addressed to gods. In its great Riddle Hymn (Sukta I.164) is the famous mantra - R.V.I.164.20, that was revealed to Rishi Deergatamaah Auchathyah and borrowed  by [[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.1.1-3, which belongs to [[Atharva Veda]], to weave the parable of the Two Birds:-Two birds.
 
:::Two birds, beautiful of wings, close companions, cling to one common tree: of the two one eats the sweet fruit of that tree; the other eats not but watches his companion. The self is the bird that sits immersed on the common tree; but because he is not lord he is bewildered and has sorrow. But when he sees that other who is the Lord and the beloved, he knows that all is His greatness and his sorrow passes away from him. When, a seer, he sees the Golden-hued, the maker, the Lord, the Spirit who is the source of Brahman, then he becomes the knower and shakes from his wings sin and virtue; pure of all stains he reaches the supreme identity.

-Translation of Verses 1-3 of Third Mundaka Upanishad by Sri Aurobindo.

Here at, [[Aurobindo]] makes the [[Spirit]] or [[Purusha]] as the Source of everything, including [[Brahman]]. He makes Purusha more fundamental. Thus, he does not have to say Brahman to be the source of inferior Brahman, and he also dismisses the sense of Reality revealed in imaginative and emotional build-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parable of Two Birds|author=Ry Deshpande|url=http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415120619/http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case of Two souls==

The Dualistic School of Philosophy initiated by Anandatirtha draws its support from  the afore-cited passage as well as from the passage of [[Katha Upanishad]] I.3.1  of an earlier Upanishad that speaks about two souls which taste the fruits of action, both of which are lodged in the recess of the human heart, and which are different from each other as light and shade, that carried the flaw – how could the Universal soul be regarded as enjoying the fruits of action? The followers of [[Madhava (Vishnu)|Madhava]] draw their support from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] XV.16 that speaks about two persons in this world, the Mutable and the Immutable; the Mutable is all these things, while the Immutable is the one who exists at the top of them, one is the Jivatman and the other, Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=151|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivatman is ''chit'', the sentient, and Paramatman is [[Isvara]], both have the same attributes; they are inseparably present together on the tree which is ''achit'', the insentient, or the gross ''Avidya'' component of existence. Jivatman and Paramatman are both seated in the heart, the former is driven by the three modes of nature and acts, the latter simply witnesses as though approving the former’s activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two birds in a tree - Soul and Supersoul|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/philosophy/two-birds-in-a-tree-soul-and-supersoul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Paramātmā, the Universal Self, and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'ātma]], the Individual Self, is likened to the indwelling God and the soul within one's heart. Paramatman is one of the many aspects of [[Brahman]]. Paramatman is situated at the core of every individual [[jiva]] in the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]]. The [[Upanishad]]s do compare Atman and Paramatman to two birds sitting like friends on the branch of a tree (body) where the Atman eats its fruits ([[karma]]), and the Paramatman only observes the Atman as a witness (sākṣin) of His friend's actions.

==Advaita==
In [[Advaita]] philosophy, individual souls are called Jīvātman, and the Highest Brahman is called Paramātman. The Jivatman and the Paramatman are known to be one and the same when the Jivatman attains the true knowledge of the Brahman (Skt. ''Brahmajñāna'')  . In the context of Advaita, the word Paramatman is invariably used to refer to [[Nirguna Brahman]], with [[Ishvara]] and [[Bhagavan]] being terms used to refer to Brahman with qualities, or [[Saguna Brahman]].

[[Brahman]] and [[Isvara]] are not synonymous words, the apparent similarity is on account of similar looking attributes imagined with regard to the impressions these two words activate. According to Advaita, Isvara is Brahman associated with Maya in its excellent aspect, as the empirical reality it is the determinate Brahman; Isvara has no reality apart from Brahman. The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] developed the conception of a personal God. The [[Katha Upanishad]] states that never has any man been able to visualise Paramatman by means of sight, heart, imagination or mind. The Anandamaya-kosha is the Isvara of the Upanishads. [[Gaudapada]] called duality Maya, and non-duality, the only reality. Maya is the Cosmic Nescience that has in it the plurality of subject and object and therefore, Isvara is organically bound with the world. Beyond the Prana or Isvara is the state of the Infinite limitless Brahman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|pages=189–197|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] VII.24, Krishna tells Arjuna – “not knowing My unsurpassable and undecaying supreme nature the ignorant believe Me to have assumed a finite form through birth.”

With regard to the cause of [[Samsāra]], as to where it resides and the means of its removal, [[Adi Shankara]] in his [[Vivekachudamani]].49. instructs that the individual self is the Paramatman in reality, the association of the individual self with ''ajnana'' i.e. with ''avidya'', which he terms as ''anatmabandhah'', bondage by the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]] or non-atman, makes it to identify itself with gross, subtle and causal bodies and from that arises [[Samsāra]] which is of the form of superimposition of qualities of ''sukha'', ''dukha'' etc., on itself, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahma Kumaris==
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion, Paramatma (Supreme Soul) is called [[Shiva]], or Shiva Baba. His form is a point of infinitesimal light and his abode is Paramdham or [[Nirvana]].

==Vaishnavism==
Paramatman is beyond knowledge and ignorance, devoid of all material attributes ([[upadhi]]). In Chapter 13 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Paramatman is described as [[Krishna]] residing in the hearts of all beings and in every atom of matter. He is the overseer and the permitter of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en Bhagavad Gita 13.23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312211826/http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en Bhagavata Purana 7.14.38] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312212902/http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramatman is different from five elements (pancha mahabhutas), the [[sense]]s, [[mind]], [[pradhana]] and jiva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en Bhagavata Purana 3.28.41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaishnavism#Vaishnava sampradayas|Vaishnava sects]] maintain that attaining knowledge of Brahman and identification of Atman with Brahman is an intermediate stage of self-realization, and only [[Bhakti Yoga]] can lead to the next step of Paramatman realization as the indwelling God, ultimately leading up to liberation ([[Moksha|Mukti]]) by God-realization.

The Viṣṇu or the deity of the ''quality of goodness'' in the material world is the puruṣa-avatāra known as [[Ksirodakasayi Vishnu|Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu]] or ''Paramātmā''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101123213949/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en]

In Bengal, Vaishnava Krishna is viewed as one endowed with his essential svarupa-shakti, he is Bhagawat in full manifestation endowed with Jivasakti and Mayasakti, he the Paramatman and Brahman. Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan are 3 gradations of the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sandhu Santidev|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
[[Time]] is described in Vedas:

{{quote|My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. ... Eternal time is the witness of all our actions, good and bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must remember that Paramātmā is our constant companion, and therefore He knows everything, past, present and future. And because the Paramātmā feature of Lord Kṛṣṇa destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move.[http://vedabase.net/sb/1/8/28/en]}}

'''Patna School of Painting''' or '''Patna Qalaam''' or '''Patna Kalam''' or '''company painting''' is a style of Indian Painting, which existed in [[Bihar]], [[India]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1upindia.com/states/bihar/culture.html Bihar Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; '''Patna Qalaam''' was world’s first independent school of painting which dealt exclusively with the commoner and his lifestyle also helped Patna Kalam paintings gain in popularity. The Principal centers were [[Patna]], [[Danapur]] and [[Arrah]].

The Patna School of Painting is facing a gradual decline and becoming a matter of past with the lapse of time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deccanherald.com/content/56522/return-patna-kalam.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pooled income fund''' is a type of charitable [[mutual fund]] created from [[securities]] or [[cash]] donated by an individual, a family or a corporation to a charity, which is then invested to provide dividends for both the donor and charity. The donations are irrevocable and tax-deductible and must be from personal assets. [[Capital gains tax]]es do not apply to securities donated to such a fund. 

After a [[Donation|donor]] dies, the balance of their donation is given to a pre-determined qualified [[501(c)(3)]] [[charitable organization]] (or several organizations). Charities typically manage their own pooled income fund, and fund their operations through the donated securities.

In addition he has written poetry, novels, and historical essays. He co-edited three editions, with Tomás Mac Síomóin, of the political, philosophical and literary journal [[Lasair]]. He began a book series in 2006 focusing on reflections on 1916. The series is called, [[Macallai na Cásca]], and there are 24 books in the series thus far.

One of his most famous books is ''[[Hidden Ulster, Protestants and the Irish language]]''. Another noted book is ''Two Godfathers of Revisionism'' (1991), which contains a discussion of [[Eugene Kamenka]]'s book on [[nationalism]] as well as a critique of the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of the [[1916 Rising]] in Irish history.&lt;ref name="list"&gt;''Two Godfathers of Revisionism: 1916 In The Revisionist Canon'' by Pádraig Ó Snodaigh. Dublin : Fulcrum Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Ó Snodaigh argues against the views of this event made by Irish historians [[F.X. Martin]] and [[Francis Shaw (historian)|Francis Shaw]] (the "two godfathers" of the book's title), whom he claims are arguing from an anti-[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="list"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Tackling the Revisionist Hierarchy" , Liam O Coileain, ''An Phoblacht'', April 9th 1992, pg.10.

He is married to the artist [[Cliodhna Cussen]]. His son  [[Aengus Ó Snodaigh|Aengus]] is a [[Sinn Féin]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]]. Three other sons, [[Rossa Ó Snodaigh|Rossa]], [[Rónán Ó Snodaigh|Rónán]], and [[Colm Ó Snodaigh|Colm]] are in the band [[Kíla]]. His other sons are Cormac and Fergus who owned and operated a security firm for 20 years until 2004.

'''Quern-stones''' are [[Rock (geology)|stone]] tools for hand-[[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]] a wide variety of materials. They are used in pairs. The lower, stationary, stone is called a '''quern''', while the upper mobile stone is called a '''handstone'''. The central hole is called the '''hopper''' and a '''handle slot''' enables the handstone to be rotated.&lt;ref name="McLaren113p106"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 113 | pages = 106 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first used in the [[Neolithic]] era to grind cereals into flour.&lt;ref name="britmus"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/q/quern_stone_for_making_flour.aspx | title=Explore/Highlights: Quern stone for making flour |publisher=The British Museum | location=London |archive-date=April 21, 2009  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421031008/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/q/quern_stone_for_making_flour.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design of quern-stones===
The upper stones were usually concave whilst the lower was convex and sometimes a [[Millrind|rind]] was present as a piece of wood etc that allowed the cereal etc to be added but still acted as a centering device. The upper stone sometimes had a cup shaped area around the hopper hole with a raised edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 106 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most handstones have a handle hole on the upper surface, however one class of quern-stones have a slot handle which indicates that a piece of wood was placed horizontally and protruded out from the edge so that the operator could turn the stone by standing and using a rod vertically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 112 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; One class of upper quern-stones has from two to three sockets for the rod used to turn them and this is thought to reflect the need to reduce wear and tear by having alternative points of contact when in active use.&lt;ref name="McLaren115"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 115 | pages = 106 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grain===

Quern-stones have been used by numerous civilizations throughout the world to grind materials, the most important of which was usually [[cereal|grain]] to make [[flour]] for [[bread]]-making. They were generally replaced by [[millstone]]s once mechanised forms of [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] appeared, particularly the [[water mill]] and the [[windmill]], although animals were also used to operate the millstones. However, in many non-Westernised, non-mechanised cultures they are still manufactured and used regularly and have only been replaced in many parts of the world in the last century or so.

In early [[Maya civilization]]s the process of [[nixtamalization]] was distinctive in that hard, ripe kernels of maize (corn) were boiled in water and lime, thus producing nixtamal which was then made into unleavened dough for flat cakes by grinding with a handstone on a quern (''metate'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D.

Quern stones were used in [[China]] at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour. The production of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Technology of Ancient China |last= Greenberger  |first= Robert |publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |year=2005 |isbn=978-1404205581 |pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their form, dimensions, and the nature of the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 6, Biology and Biological Technology, Part 5, Fermentations and Food Science |last=Huang |first=H.T. |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0521652704 |volume=6 |publication-date=November 30, 2000 |page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Archaeology of Early China: From Prehistory to the Han Dynasty |last=Shelach-Lavi |first=Gideon  |publisher= Cambridge University Press  |year=2015 |isbn=978-0521145251 |publication-date=January 26, 2015 |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other materials===
As well as grain, ethnographic evidence and [[Mesopotamian]] texts shows that a wide range of foodstuffs and inorganic materials were processed using stone querns or mortars, including nuts, seeds, fruit, vegetables, herbs, spices, meat, bark, pigments, temper and clay.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1992:87f&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, one study analysing quern-stones noted that a number of querns had traces of [[arsenic]] and [[bismuth]], unlike their source rocks, and had levels of [[antimony]] which were ten times higher than those of the rocks. The authors concluded that this was probably due to the use of these querns in the preparation of medicines, cosmetics, dyes or even in the manufacture of alloys.&lt;ref&gt;Lease et al. 2001:235&lt;/ref&gt;

Querns were widely used in grinding metals ores after mining extraction. The aim was to liberate fine ore particles which could then be separated by washing for example, prior to smelting. They were thus widely used in [[gold mining]] in antiquity.

In the [[Shetland]]s tobacco was not smoked when first introduced, but instead was ground up into [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], and inhaled up the nose. Snuff-querns consisted of an upper and lower stone, fixed together by a central iron pivot. The quern was held on the user's lap, the eye of the quern was filled with dried tobacco leaves, and then the upper-stone was turned using the handle. The friction caused by the turning ground the leaves into a fine powder that built up around the edge of the lower-stone. Many snuff-querns had a small hole or cut made near the edge of the upper-stone, into which a pointed end of a lamb's horn was placed in order to turn the stone; an alternative to using a handle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-591-022-C Snuff Quern. Accessed | 2009-11-20]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incidental uses===
[[Image:Quern-stones in China small.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A stack of quern-stones for sale in a market in [[Haikou]], [[Hainan]], [[China]]. These quern-stones are only about 30 cm wide.]]
There are, however, more surprising recorded uses of quern-stones. For example, DeBoer, in his review of the traditional gambling games of North American tribes, reports that one of the games involved bouncing a group of split canes off a quern.&lt;ref&gt;DeBoer 2001:223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violence is recorded in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:53; [[NRSV]]): “But a certain woman threw an upper-millstone on [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]]’s head, and crushed his skull.”

==Manufacture of quern-stones==
The best type of stone from which to manufacture quern-stones are [[igneous]] rocks such as [[basalt]]. These have naturally rough surfaces, but grains do not detach easily, so the material being ground does not become gritty. However, such rocks are not always available, meaning that quern-stones have been manufactured from a wide variety of rocks, including [[sandstone]], [[quartzite]] and [[limestone]]. Quernmore Crag near [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in England is named after the quarrying of millstone grit used to make quern stones in these parts.

Rutter was able to show, for the southern Levant, that basalt quern-stones were preferred to those manufactured from other rock types. Basalt quern-stones were therefore transported over long-distances, leading him to argue that, despite their every-day, utilitarian function, they were also used as a [[status symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rutter|first=Graham|title=Basaltic-rock procurement systems in the southern Levant|date=2003|publisher=PhD thesis, University of Durham|page=236|url=http://0lem.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/basalt-procurement/|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in Scotland has indicated that to a degree regional styles existed.&lt;ref name="McLaren"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 122 - 125 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Evolution of quern-stones==
[[Knocking stone]]s were used in the preparation of small quantities of cereal however the earliest forms of quern were the saddle and trough querns. The earliest quern so far discovered dates to c. 9,000 BCE and was found at Abu Hureyra, Syria.&lt;ref name="britmus"/&gt; A later development was the rotary quern, which takes several forms.

===Saddle quern===
The saddle quern is produced by rocking or rolling the handstone using parallel motions (i.e., pushing and pulling the handstone), which forms a shape looking like a [[saddle]]. These are the most ancient and widely used type of quern-stone and were superseded around the 5th to the 4th century BC by the more efficient rotary quern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 105 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The handstones for saddle querns are generally either roughly cylindrical (not unlike a [[rolling pin]]) and used with both hands, or rough hemispheres and used with one hand. This provides a crushing motion, not a grinding action and is more suitable for crushing malted grain. It is not easy to produce flour from a saddle quern with unmalted grain. The handstone is also referred to as a 'rubber' or 'mouler'.&lt;ref&gt;MacSween, A &amp; Sharp, M (1989), ''Prehistoric Scotland.'' London : B.T.Batsford. {{ISBN|0-7134-6173-X}}. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotary hand quern===
As the name implies, the rotary quern used circular motions to grind the material, meaning both the quern and the handstone were generally circular. The handstone of a rotary quern is much heavier than that of saddle quern and provides the necessary weight for the grinding of unmalted grain into flour. In some cases the grinding surfaces of the stones fit into each other, the upper stone being slightly concave and the lower one convex.

====Beehive quern====
[[File:Quern stones.JPG|left|thumb|190px|&lt;center&gt;Querns from the [[Whithorn]] Museum]]In this type the upper stone is hemispherical, or bun-shaped, with a central conical hopper to hold the grain that falls down a hole to the grinding surface. It is held in position with a pivot that fits into a central hole in the bottom stone. The upper stone also has a deep horizontal socket in its steep side in which to place the wooden peg used as a handle to rotate or oscillate the upper stone. This was the earliest type of rotary quern to appear in the British Isles. It arrived in Britain in the middle of the Iron Age (about 400-300 BC) and spread into the northern half of Ireland, probably from Scotland, some time after the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name="J.T. Koch, 2007 p. 150"&gt;J.T. Koch, ''An Atlas for Celtic Studies'' (2007), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disc quern====
[[Image:Handquern1.jpg|right|thumb|190px|&lt;center&gt;A hand quern being operated&lt;ref name="Garnett155"&gt;Garnett, T. ''Observations on a Tour through the Highlands and part of the Western Isles of Scotland, particularly Staff and Icolmkill.'' Pub. T. Cadell. The Strand. P. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The adjustable, discoid rotary quern has larger, flatter and more discoid stones than the beehive type. The lower stone was completely perforated. The long handle rotated in a shallow socket in the upper surface of the upper stone. They are thought to have originated in [[Spain]] 2,500 years ago&lt;ref name="Ritti et al. 2007, 159"&gt;{{harvnb|Ritti|Grewe|Kessener|2007|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appear to have arrived in maritime Scotland from about 200 BC with people who built the defensive homes known as [[broch]]s. This Iron Age type closely resembles the adjustable Highland quern still in use in historic times.&lt;ref&gt;E.W. MacKie, The broch cultures of Atlantic Scotland: origins, high noon and decline: part 2: The Middle Iron Age: high noon and decline c.200 BC&amp;nbsp;– AD 550, ''Oxford Journal of Archaeology'', vol. 29, no 1. (2010), pp. 89-117 (100).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Girl with ponytail-Women at the Quern.jpg|thumb|left|The quern rests on the [[earasaid]] of the woman on the right, possibly to catch grain; she feeds the stone with grain from the bowl at her left. Woodcut from [[Thomas Pennant]]'s 1772 book ''A Tour in Scotland''.]]

Garnett in his 1800 tour of Scotland describes the use of a hand quern as follows: "The quern consists of two circular pieces of stone, generally grit or granite, about twenty inches in diameter. In the lower stone is a wooden peg, rounded at the top; on this the upper stone is nicely balanced, so as just to touch the lower one, by means of a piece of wood fixed in a large hole in this upper piece, but which does not fill the hole, room for feeding the mill being left on each side: it is so nicely balanced, that though there is some friction from the contact of the two stones, yet a very small momentum will make it revolve several times, when it has no corn in it. The corn being dried, two women sit down on the ground, having the quern between them; the one feeds it, while the other turns it round, relieving each other occasionally, and singing some Celtic songs all the time."&lt;ref name="Garnett155"/&gt;

====Miniature quern====
Under 200mm in diameter and varying from roughly dressed to carefully worked, often with vertical handle sockets, a new class of querns has been identified having been overlooked in the past as weights, etc. In all respects they are like full sized quern stones and they show the typical wear signs that indicate that they were used for grinding small amounts of seeds, minerals or herbs. A suggestion that they may have been made as toys is thought to be unlikely.&lt;ref name="McLaren2008"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 119 - 122 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other types of quern stones===
Other forms of quern-stone include hopper-rubbers and Pompeian mills, both used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The larger rotary mills were usually worked by a donkey or horse via an extension arm of wood attached to the upper stone.
[[File:Roman mill.ogg|thumb|right|Sound of a Roman mill.]]
{{Commons category|Ancient Roman mills}}

==Laws against use==
There was a legal requirement in [[Scotland]] for tenants to pay for use of the baron's mill. Early leases of mills gave to the miller the legal right to break quern-stones which were being used in defiance of [[thirlage]] agreements.&lt;ref name="Gauldie"&gt;Enid Gauldie, ''The Scottish Miller 1700–1900''(John Donald 1981), {{ISBN|0-85976-067-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The obligations of thirlage eventually ceased to apply, but thirlage in Scotland was only formally and totally abolished on 28 November ([[Martinmas]]) 2004 by the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080810012035/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2000/en/00en05-a.htm ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar requirements existed and were enforced actively in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.robinthewood.co.uk/Quernsm%20-&amp;-Mill-Stones.html Querns and millstones]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917050138/http://www.robinthewood.co.uk/Quernsm%20-%26-Mill-Stones.html |date=September 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ornament and inscription==
A number of handstones have been found with extra carving however it is not always straightforward to separate decoration from practical functional purposes. The designs invest in the appearance of the handstone when it is in circular motion and the ability of the quern-stones to change seeds into flour may invoke a feeling of transformative magic that attracted both reverence and status to these household objects.&lt;ref name="McLaren119"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 119 | pages = 106 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three beehive querns found in Ireland have inscribed ornament of [[La Tène]] type,&lt;ref name="J.T. Koch, 2007 p. 150"/&gt; as do examples from England and Wales.&lt;ref name="McLaren113p117"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 113 | pages = 117 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the horizontal slot-handled quern-stones have decoration that usually follows the basic pattern of motifs that encircle the hopper and/or the handle slot. One type though has an irregular pattern of cup marks that encircle the hopper.&lt;ref name="McLaren113p106" /&gt;

A quern was discovered at [[Dunadd]] in Scotland which has a cross carved into the upper stone. The cross has expanded terminals and ultimately derives its form from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] predecessors of the fifth and sixth centuries. This example has a high quality of finishing which reflects its 'cost' and enhances its symbolic value and social significance. The cross is likely to have 'protected' the corn and the resultant flour from evil, such as fungal [[Rust (fungus)|rust]] or [[ergot]]. Various legends give miraculous power to mill-stones and several have been found which have been re-used in the construction of burial cists or as tomb stones. The association between quern stones and burial may be because they are used in the process of making bread, the staple of life. A broken or disused quern therefore can be seen as symbolic of death.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Ewan Campbell, A cross-marked quern from Dunadd and other evidence for relations between Dunass and Iona, ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', vol. 5, no. 117 (1987), pp. 105 - 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Clonmacnoise]], near [[Athlone]] in County Offaly in [[Ireland]], a quern stone was found which had been made into a tombstone, having been ornamented and the name Sechnasach, who died in 928 AD, inscribed onto it.&lt;ref name="Bord"&gt;Janet and Colin Bord, ''Mysterious Britain'' (Garnstone 1973), {{ISBN|0-85511-180-1}}. P. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; A large quern was discovered on the [[Lough Scur]] [[crannog]] in [[Ireland]].

==The Wondrous Mauchline Quern==
In the 9th century the Welsh monk [[Nennius]] wrote a history of Britain, the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', in which he lists the thirteen wonders of Britain, and included in it is the wondrous '[[Mauchline]] Quern' that ground constantly, except on Sundays. It could be heard working underground and the local placename 'Auchenbrain' may celebrate it, translating from the Gaelic as 'field of the quern''.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William J. (1926).

== Early career ==
Sténuit began [[spelunking]] at the age of seventeen. He discovered [[underwater diving|diving]] in 1953, when he began [[scuba diving]] in [[cave diving|flooded caves]] in Belgium. He subsequently became interested in [[speleology]], and went on to spend many years exploring the [[Caves of Han-sur-Lesse]].&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Sténuit |title=The Deepest Days |others=Trans. Morris Kemp |publisher=[[Coward-McCann]] |location=New York |year=1966 |lccn=66-10428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stenuit, Robert with Jasinski, Marc |title=Caves and the marvellous world beneath us |others=Trans. Harry Pearman |publisher=[[Alfred Smith Barnes|A.S. Barnes and Company]] |location=New York |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sténuit had a passion for history. At the age of 20, after reading ''600 Milliards Sous les Mers'' by [http://classicdivebooks.customer.netspace.net.au/oeclassics-a-rieseberg.html Harry Reiseberg], a work of fiction about [[shipwrecks]] and treasure diving, Sténuit left the [[Free University of Brussels]], where he was studying [[political science|political]] and [[diplomacy|diplomatic science]] in preparation for a career as a lawyer.&lt;ref name="Sténuit 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Immersed"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Sean |last=Holland |title=Salvor, Archeologist Robert Sténuit |journal=Immersed |issue=032 |pages=10–11, 14–16 |year=1999 |url=http://www.nothingtosea.com/docs/immersed_rs.pdf |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 Sténuit began looking for the treasures of the [[Spanish treasure fleet|Spanish fleet]] sunk in 1702 at the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]] by English and Dutch warships. He searched without success, finding only modern wrecks.&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Footnote 1"&gt;''Treasures of the Armada'' (Sténuit), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Footnote 2"&gt;According to Holland, Sténuit began cave diving in 1952 and treasure hunting in Vigo Bay in 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with another sunken treasure hunter, the American John Potter, Sténuit worked for the Atlantic Salvage Company, Ltd. on the specially-equipped vessel ''Dios Te Guarde'' for search and recovery of underwater [[treasure]], beginning another search for the wrecks of the 1702 Plate Fleet, which lasted two years.&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 1"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord Kilbracken |authorlink=John Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken |date=May 1963 |title=The Long, Deep Dive |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |volume=123 |issue=5 |pages=718–731 |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Sténuit worked as a professional diver for the French company SOGETRAM (Société Générale de Travaux Maritimes et Fluviaux), but eventually left SOGETRAM to become the chief diver for Edwin Link's Man in Sea project.&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HDS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Historical Diving Society – In Memory of Andre Galerne |first=Christopher |last=Swan |date=October 15, 2009 |url=http://www.hds.org/InMemory/AG/AndreGalerne.html |publisher=[[Historical Diving Society]] USA |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002931/http://www.hds.org/InMemory/AG/AndreGalerne.html |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Man in Sea project ==
From September 6–10, 1962, Sténuit participated in Man in Sea, Edwin Link's first experiment with an [[underwater habitat]], which was performed with a submersible decompression chamber (SDC) at [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] on the Mediterranean, at a depth of 200 feet (62 m).&lt;ref name="Marion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LinkColl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.binghamton.edu/specialcollections/findingaids/linkcoll_m3.html |title=Edwin A. Link 1904–1981 |first1=Martha |last1=Clark |first2=Jeanne |last2=Eichelberger |accessdate=August 26, 2011 |publisher=[[Binghamton University#Facilities and places|Binghamton University Libraries]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317171710/http://library.binghamton.edu/specialcollections/findingaids/linkcoll_m3.html |archivedate=March 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While submerged in the cylinder, Sténuit breathed a [[helium]]-[[oxygen]] mixture ([[Heliox]]). The experiment was conducted from Link's [[yacht]], the ''Sea Diver''.&lt;ref name="Marion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 1"/&gt; Sténuit remained on the sea floor for over 24 hours, becoming the world's first aquanaut.&lt;ref name="Marion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecott"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LinkColl"/&gt;

During this dive, a [[mistral (wind)|mistral]] sank the ''Reef Diver'', the ''Sea Diver'''s launch, which was carrying fifteen bottles of helium.&lt;ref name="Marion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 1"/&gt; A mistral surge also caused the cylinder to float back to the surface, where Sténuit remained safe from [[decompression sickness]] because the cylinder was still pressurized. A [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] boat brought an additional supply of helium during the night of September 7–8, allowing Sténuit to continue to be supplied with helium while [[decompression (diving)|decompressing]].&lt;ref name="Marion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;  

Edwin Link's second Man in Sea experiment was conducted in June–July 1964 in the [[Berry Islands]] (a chain in the [[Bahamas]]) with Sténuit and [[Jon Lindbergh]], one of the sons of [[Charles Lindbergh]], who made the first solo nonstop flight across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Sténuit and Lindbergh stayed in the SPID habitat (Submersible, Portable, Inflatable Dwelling) for 49 hours underwater at a depth of 432 feet, breathing a helium-oxygen mixture.&lt;ref name="Marion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LinkColl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Link |first=Edwin A. |authorlink=Edwin Albert Link |date=April 1965 |title=Outpost Under the Ocean |journal=National Geographic |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=530–533 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 3"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Sténuit |date=April 1965 |title=The Deepest Days |journal=National Geographic |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=534–547 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacInnis"&gt;{{cite book|first=Joe|last=MacInnis|authorlink=Joseph B.

MacInnis]] participated in this dive as a [[life support]] specialist.&lt;ref name="Marion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacInnis"/&gt; At the end of the two divers' decompression, a ''Sea Diver'' crew member and Sténuit's wife, Annie Sténuit, sustained minor injuries when the end of an air tank blew off. Sténuit, who had developed a case of [[Decompression sickness|the bends]] during decompression, still had some lingering symptoms afterwards in his shoulders and ankles, but these eventually dissipated.&lt;ref name="Hellwarth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hellwarth|first=Ben|title=Sealab: America's Forgotten Quest to Live and Work on the Ocean Floor|location=New York|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2012|pages=102–103|isbn=978-0-7432-4745-0|lccn=2011015725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V4sbNMwQJI4C&amp;pg=PT102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Man in Sea project was taken over by a new company, [[Ocean Systems Inc.]]&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LinkColl"/&gt; Link departed from the project, but Sténuit remained as a researcher, adviser and development engineer, conducting test dives in [[decompression chamber]]s and underwater habitats and computing new helium-oxygen [[decompression table]]s for greater depths.&lt;ref name="Sténuit 2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt; In 1966, Ocean Systems established an office in London with Sténuit in charge. His professional work at this time involved drilling on off-shore [[Oil platform|oil and gas rigs]] in the [[North Sea]], but in his spare time he began researching the wreck of the Spanish [[galleass]] ''[[Girona (ship)|Girona]]''.&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Footnote 3"&gt;''Treasures of the Armada'' (Sténuit), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underwater archeologist ==
Sténuit became involved with [[underwater archeology]] and the search for [[shipwrecks]], collaborating with [[Henri Delauze]] (president of [[Compagnie maritime d'expertises|COMEX]]).&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 4"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Sténuit |year=1969 |title=Ireland's Rugged Coast Yields Priceless Relics of the Spanish Armada |journal=National Geographic |volume=135 |issue=6 |pages=745–777 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Footnote 4"&gt;''Treasures of the Armada'' (Sténuit), pp. 7, 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGM 5"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Sténuit |year=1975 |title=The Treasure of Porto Santo |journal=National Geographic |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=260–275 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Sténuit created the "Groupe de Recherche Archéologique Sous-Marine Post-Médiévale" (Group for Underwater Post-Medieval Archaeological Research), or "GRASP". GRASP has managed the inventory of 17 merchant shipwrecks and a number of warships from the 16th century through the 19th century.&lt;ref name="ISC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Immersed"/&gt; 

Sténuit's most important underwater archaeological discoveries are:

Robert Sténuit is the author of several books on diving and underwater archeology translated into several languages. Currently, he remains an active seeker of underwater treasures' location and identification, especially in wrecks of ships that belonged to the various East India companies. He continues to direct GRASP alongside his daughter, [[archeologist]] Marie-Eve Sténuit.&lt;ref name="ISC"/&gt;

[[File:The San Pedro Mountain Mummy.jpg|framed|Photos and X-ray of the mummy]]
In October 1932, while digging for gold in the San Pedro mountains, [[Carbon County, Wyoming]], two prospectors, Cecil Mayne and Frank Carr, blasted their way through some thick rock that a large vein of gold continued into. When the dust settled, they saw they had opened up a small room, approximately 4&amp;nbsp;ft tall, 4&amp;nbsp;ft wide, and about 15&amp;nbsp;ft deep. This is where they said that they first saw the [[mummy]] of a [[little people (mythology)|tiny person]].

This first mummy was examined using X-rays which determined that it was the body of an [[Anencephaly|anencephalic infant]] "whose cranial deformity gave it the appearance of a miniature adult." A second mummy examined by University of Wyoming anthropologist George Gill and the Denver Children's Hospital in the 1990s was also shown to be an anencephalic infant. DNA testing showed it to be Native American and radiocarbon dating dated it to about 1700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loendorf|first=Lawrence L.|title=Mountain Spirit: The Sheep Eater Indians of Yellowstone|year=2006|publisher=University of Utah Press|isbn=978-0874808681|page=189|author2=Nancy Medaris Stone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a July 7, 1979, article in the ''[[Casper Star-Tribune]]'' the first mummy started debates over whether it was a hoax, a baby, or one of the legendary "[[Little people (mythology)|little people]]". The mummy ended up in [[Meeteetse, Wyoming]], at a local drug store where it was shown as an attraction for several years before it was bought by [[Ivan T. Goodman]], a [[Casper, Wyoming]] businessman. The mummy was then passed on to Leonard Wadler, a New York businessman and its present location is unknown.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/article_c77f7c03-6169-5f9f-b3a8-4350c70b8966.html|title=Man offers $10,000 for Pedro Mountain Mummy|last=Burke|first=Brendan|date=February 3, 2005|work=Casper Star-Tribune|publisher=trib.com|accessdate=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to prove evolution wrong, an offer of a $10,000 reward was made for the person who finds the missing mummy according to the Casper Star-Tribune.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Its current stated mission is to "foster biblical scholarship". Membership is open to the public, and consists of over 8,500 individuals from over 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/membership/default.aspx SBL membership], Society of Biblical Literature&lt;/ref&gt; As a scholarly organization, SBL has been a constituent society of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acls.org/sbibllit.htm SBL] @ American Council of Learned Societies official site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The eight founders of The Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis first met to discuss their new society in [[Philip Schaff]]'s study in New York City in January 1880. In June the group had their first Annual Meeting with eighteen people in attendance. The new society drew up a constitution and by-laws and discussed several papers. Membership dues were set at three dollars. By the end of the year, membership had grown to forty-five and publication of the meeting proceedings were in the planning stages. The Journal of Biblical Literature (JBL) was launched the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Ernest W. ''Searching the Scriptures: A History of the Society of Biblical Literature, 1880-1980''. SBL Biblical Scholarship in North America 8. Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1982. {{ISBN|978-0891305910}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SBL was not the first association dedicated to biblical studies in North America, but it was the first that was interdenominational.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ritchel Ames, Charles William Miller ''Foster Biblical Scholarship: Essays in Honor of Kent Harold Richards'' 2010 p68 "The Society of Biblical Literature was not the first association dedicated to the study of the Bible in North America, but it was the first group that was both interinstitutional and interdenominational.

Of the thirty-two founding fathers only one&amp;nbsp;– Ezra Abbott&amp;nbsp;– was a Unitarian, and he was educated at Bowdoin and self- trained in biblical criticism.41 Five of the fathers ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The society's development was contemporary with increasing interest in [[Ancient Near East]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;William Rainey Harper, Ernest De Witt Burton, Shailer Mathews ''The Biblical world''  1912 p39 "In the same year in which the Society of Biblical Literature was founded [[Francis Brown (theologian)|Francis Brown]] began to offer courses in Assyrian at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Seminary]].

Spanish is a part of the [[Iberian Romance languages|Ibero-Romance group of languages]], which evolved from several dialects of [[Vulgar Latin]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] after the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century. The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid-northern Iberia in the 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/11/07/castillayleon/1289123856.html | title = La RAE avala que Burgos acoge las primeras palabras escritas en castellano | language = Spanish| publisher = El mundo | place = ES | date = 7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first systematic written use of the language happened in [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], then capital of the [[Kingdom of Castile]], in the 13th century. Beginning in the early 16th century, Spanish was taken to the viceroyalties of the [[Spanish Empire]], most notably to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|the Americas]], as well as [[Spanish Empire#Territories in Africa (1885–1975)|territories in Africa]], [[Oceania]] and the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sejours-linguistiques-en-espagne.com/index.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130118163355/http://sejours-linguistiques-en-espagne.com/index.html|archivedate= 18 January 2013|title=Spanish languages "Becoming the language for trade" in Spain and |publisher=sejours-linguistiques-en-espagne.com|date=|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 75% of modern Spanish vocabulary is derived from [[Latin]].
[[Ancient Greek]] has also contributed substantially to Spanish vocabulary, especially through Latin, where it had a great impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robles|first1=Heriberto Camacho Becerra, Juan José Comparán Rizo, Felipe Castillo|title=Manual de etimologías grecolatinas|date=1998|publisher=Limusa|location=México|isbn=9681855426|page=19|edition=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Comparán Rizo|first1=Juan José|title=Raices Griegas y latinas|publisher=Ediciones Umbral|isbn=9789685430012|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caqn_7i6tvkC|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimated number of speakers ==
It is estimated that more than 437 million people speak Spanish as a [[native language]], which qualifies it as second on the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|lists of languages by number of native speakers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/size|title=Summary by language size|work=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instituto Cervantes]] claims that there are an estimated 477 million Spanish speakers with native competence and 572 million Spanish speakers as a first or second language—including speakers with limited competence—and more than 21 million students of [[Spanish as a foreign language]].&lt;ref name="InstitutoCervantes"&gt;[https://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/espanol_lengua_viva/pdf/espanol_lengua_viva_2017.pdf Cervantes.es] – [[Instituto Cervantes]] (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish is the official or national language in Spain, [[Equatorial Guinea]], and [[Hispanic America|19 countries in the Americas]]. [[Spanish language in the Americas|Speakers in the Americas]] total some 418 million. It is also an optional language in the [[Philippines]] as it was a [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colony]] from 1569 to 1899. In the [[European Union]], Spanish is the mother tongue of 8% of the population, with an additional 7% speaking it as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106183351/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish is the most popular second language learned in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0905275.html |title=Most Studied Foreign Languages in the U.S |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was estimated by the [[American Community Survey]] that of the 55 million Hispanic United States residents who are five years of age and over, 38 million speak Spanish at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/|title=American Community Survey (ACS)|author=US Census Bureau|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2011 paper by U.S. Census Bureau Demographers Jennifer Ortman and Hyon B. Shin, the number of Spanish speakers is projected to rise through 2020 to anywhere between 39 million and 43 million, depending on the assumption one makes about immigration. Most of these Spanish speakers will be Hispanic, with Ortman and Shin projecting between 37.5 million and 41 million Hispanic Spanish speakers by 2020.

{{rewrite section|date=December 2014}}

[[File:Castellano-Español.png|right|thumb|Map indicating places where the language is called ''castellano'' or ''español'']]

In Spain and in some other parts of the Spanish-speaking world, Spanish is called not only {{lang|es|[[wikt:español#Spanish|español]]}} (Spanish) but also {{lang|es|[[wikt:castellano#Spanish|castellano]]}} (Castilian), the language from the [[kingdom of Castile]], contrasting it with other [[languages of Spain|languages spoken in Spain]] such as [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] and [[Occitan Language|Occitan]].

The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] uses the term {{lang|es|castellano}} to define the [[official language]] of the whole Spanish State in contrast to {{lang|es|las demás lenguas españolas}} (lit. "the other [[languages of Spain|Spanish languages]]"). Article III reads as follows:

{{quote|{{lang|es|El castellano es la lengua española oficial del Estado.&amp;nbsp;... Las demás lenguas españolas serán también oficiales en las respectivas Comunidades Autónomas...}}&lt;br&gt;
Castilian is the official Spanish language of the State.&amp;nbsp;... The other Spanish languages shall also be official in their respective Autonomous Communities...}}
The [[Real Academia Española|Spanish Royal Academy]], on the other hand, currently uses the term {{lang|es|español}} in its publications, but from 1713 to 1923 called the language {{lang|es|castellano}}.

The {{lang|es|[[Diccionario panhispánico de dudas]]}} (a language guide published by the Spanish Royal Academy) states that, although the Spanish Royal Academy prefers to use the term {{lang|es|español}} in its publications when referring to the Spanish language, both terms—{{lang|es|español}} and {{lang|es|castellano}}—are regarded as synonymous and equally valid.&lt;ref&gt;Diccionario panhispánico de dudas, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;271–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two etymologies for {{lang|es|español}} have been suggested. The [[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española|Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary]] derives the term from the [[Occitan language|Provençal]] word {{lang|oc|espaignol}}, and that in turn from the Medieval Latin word {{lang|la|Hispaniolus}}, 'from—or pertaining to—Hispania'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/ |title=Diccionario de la lengua española |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authorities&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Menéndez Pidal, ''Manual de gramática histórica española'' (Espasa-Calpe, 1968), §66.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd A. Kasten and Florian J. Cody, ''Tentative Dictionary of Medieval Spanish'' (2nd ed., Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; attribute it to a supposed mediaeval Latin *{{lang|la|hispaniōne}}, with the same meaning.

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Spanish language}}

[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Visigothic [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Spanish Royal Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the [[Glosas Emilianenses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|title=cartularioshistoria|website=www.euskonews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Spanish language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], which was brought to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] during the [[Second Punic War]], beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called [[Paleohispanic languages]])—unrelated to Latin, and some of them unrelated even to Indo-European—were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included [[Basque language|Basque]] (still spoken today), [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]].

The first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[modern era]], the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring [[Romance languages]]—[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ([[Andalusi Romance]]), [[Navarro-Aragonese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and later, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as a minor influence from the Germanic [[Gothic language]] through the migration of tribes and a period of [[Visigoth]] rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both [[Classical Latin]] and [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin in use at that time.

According to the theories of [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], local [[sociolect]]s of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of [[Burgos]], and this dialect was later brought to the city of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Penny1&gt;{{cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see [[Iberian Romance languages]]). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of [[Al-Andalus]], much of it indirectly, through the Romance [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic dialects]] (some 4,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in the 13th to 16th centuries, and [[Madrid]], from the 1570s.&lt;ref name=Penny1 /&gt;

The development of the [[Spanish phonology|Spanish sound system]] from that of [[Vulgar Latin]] exhibits most of the changes that are typical of [[Western Romance languages]], including [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|vīta}}}} &gt; Spanish {{lang|es|vida}}). The [[Vowel breaking|diphthongization]] of Latin stressed short {{smallcaps|e}} and {{smallcaps|o}}—which occurred in [[Syllable coda|open syllables]] in French and Italian, but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese—is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish, as shown in the following table:

[[File:Linguistic map Southwestern Europe.gif|thumb|Chronological map showing linguistic evolution in southwest Europe]]
Spanish is marked by the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of the Latin double consonants {{smallcaps|nn}} and {{smallcaps|ll}} (thus Latin
{{lang|la|{{smallcaps|annum}}}} &gt; Spanish {{lang|es|año}}, and Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|anellum}}}} &gt; Spanish
{{lang|es|anillo}}).

The consonant written {{lang|la|u}} or {{lang|la|v}} in Latin and pronounced {{IPA|[w]}} in Classical Latin had probably "[[Fortition|fortified]]" to a bilabial fricative {{IPA|/β/}} in Vulgar Latin. In early Spanish (but not in Catalan or Portuguese) it merged with the consonant written ''b'' (a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones). In modern Spanish, there is [[betacism|no difference]] between the pronunciation of orthographic {{lang|es|b}} and {{lang|es|v}}, with some exceptions in Caribbean Spanish.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Peculiar to Spanish (as well as to the neighboring [[Gascon language|Gascon]] dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and attributed to a Basque [[substratum]]) was the mutation of Latin initial {{lang|la|f}} into {{lang|es|h-}} whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize. The {{lang|es|h-}}, still preserved in spelling, is now silent in most varieties of the language, although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects it is still aspirated in some words. Because of borrowings from Latin and from neighboring Romance languages, there are many {{lang|es|f}}-/{{lang|es|h}}-doublets in modern Spanish: {{lang|es|Fernando}} and {{lang|es|Hernando}} (both Spanish for "Ferdinand"), {{lang|es|ferrero}} and {{lang|es|herrero}} (both Spanish for "smith"), {{lang|es|fierro}} and {{lang|es|hierro}} (both Spanish for "iron"), and {{lang|es|fondo}} and {{lang|es|hondo}} (both Spanish for "deep", but {{lang|es|fondo}} means "bottom" while {{lang|es|hondo}} means "deep"); {{lang|es|hacer}} (Spanish for "to make") is cognate to the root word of {{lang|es|satisfacer}} (Spanish for "to satisfy"), and {{lang|es|hecho}} ("made") is similarly cognate to the root word of {{lang|es|satisfecho}} (Spanish for "satisfied").

In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its [[sibilant consonants]], known in Spanish as the {{lang|es|[[:es:Reajuste de las sibilantes del idioma español|reajuste de las sibilantes]]}}, which resulted in the distinctive velar {{IPA|[x]}} pronunciation of the letter {{angle bracket|j}} and—in a large part of Spain—the characteristic interdental {{IPA|[θ]}} ("th-sound") for the letter {{angle bracket|z}} (and for {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}). See [[History of Spanish#Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants|History of Spanish (Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants)]] for details.

The {{lang|es|[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]}}, written in [[Salamanca]] in 1492 by [[Antonio de Nebrija|Elio Antonio de Nebrija]], was the first grammar written for a modern European language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Spanish_language.aspx#1O29-SPANISH |title=Spanish Language Facts |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a popular anecdote, when Nebrija presented it to [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella I]], she asked him what was the use of such a work, and he answered that language is the instrument of empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crow |first=John A. |title=Spain: the root and the flower |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g2NKy8QCxw4C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=Nebrija+first+spanish+grammar+Isabel&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q= |year=2005 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-24496-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his introduction to the grammar, dated 18 August 1492, Nebrija wrote that "... language was always the companion of empire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Hugh |title=Rivers of Gold: the rise of the Spanish empire, from Columbus to Magellan |page=78 |year=2005 |publisher=Random House Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7055-5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b38f7b1WmOwC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Nebrija+first+spanish+grammar+Isabel&amp;d=5#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the sixteenth century onwards, the language was taken to [[Americas|America]] and the [[Spanish East Indies]] via [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of America]]. [[Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]], author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', is such a well-known reference in the world that Spanish is often called {{lang|es|la lengua de Cervantes}} ("the language of Cervantes").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=La lengua de Cervantes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |publisher=Ministerio de la Presidencia de España |format=PDF |accessdate=24 August 2008 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003083955/http://www.cepc.es/rap/Publicaciones/Revistas/2/REP_031-032_288.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, Spanish was introduced to [[Equatorial Guinea]] and the [[Western Sahara]], and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire, such as [[Spanish Harlem]] in [[New York City]].

== Grammar ==
{{Main|Spanish grammar}}
[[File:Cervantes Jáuregui.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miguel de Cervantes]], considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', widely considered the first modern European novel.]]

Most of the grammatical and [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features of Spanish are shared with the other [[Romance languages]]. Spanish is a [[fusional language]]. The [[Spanish nouns|noun]] and [[Spanish adjectives|adjective]] systems exhibit two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]], in addition articles and some [[Spanish pronouns|pronouns]] and [[Spanish determiners|determiners]] have a neuter gender in singular. There are about fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per [[verb]], with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 [[verboid]] forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. Verbs express [[T-V distinction]] by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see [[Spanish verbs]] and [[Spanish irregular verbs]].)

Spanish [[syntax]] is considered [[Branching (linguistics)|right-branching]], meaning that subordinate or [[Grammatical modifier|modifying]] [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for [[Grammatical case|case]]), and usually—though not always—places [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s, as do most other Romance languages.

The language is classified as a [[subject–verb–object]] language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] rather than by syntax. It is a "[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]", or "[[Null-subject language|null-subject]]" language—that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] unnecessary. Spanish is described as a "[[Verb framing|verb-framed]]" language, meaning that the ''direction'' of motion is expressed in the verb while the ''mode'' of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. ''subir corriendo'' or ''salir volando''; the respective English equivalents of these examples—'to run up' and 'to fly out'—show that English is, by contrast, "satellite-framed", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).

Subject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.

== Phonology ==
{{IPA notice}}
[[File:Miguel Hache - voice.ogg|thumb|Spanish spoken in Spain]]
{{Main|Spanish phonology}}

The Spanish phonemic system is originally descended from that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. Its development exhibits some traits in common with the neighboring dialects—especially [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]—as well as other traits unique to [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]. Castilian is unique among its neighbors in the aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} sound (e.g. Cast. {{lang|es|harina}} vs. Leon. and Arag. {{lang|ast|farina}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|pp=117 and 222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin initial consonant sequences {{lang|la|pl-}}, {{lang|la|cl-}}, and {{lang|la|fl-}} in Spanish typically become {{lang|es|ll-}} (originally pronounced {{IPA|[ʎ]}}), while in Aragonese they are preserved, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, and {{IPA|[ʎ]}}. Where Latin had {{lang|la|-li-}} before a vowel (e.g. {{lang|la|filius}}) or the ending {{lang|la|-iculus}}, {{lang|la|-icula}} (e.g. {{lang|la|auricula}}), Old Spanish produced {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} ({{lang|es|hijo}}, {{lang|es|oreja}}, where neighboring languages have the palatal lateral {{IPA|[ʎ]}} (e.g. Portuguese {{lang|pt|filho}}, {{lang|pt|orelha}}; Catalan {{lang|ca|fill}}, {{lang|ca|orella}}).

=== Segmental phonology ===
[[File:Spanish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Spanish vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Johnson|2010|p=227}}]]
The Spanish [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2014|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The main [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to glides—{{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively—when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.

The Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three [[nasal stop|nasal]] phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) [[lateral consonant|lateral]] phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position [[Archiphonemic|lose their contrast]] and are subject to [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following consonant; (2) three [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Plosive|stops]] and the [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/tʃ/}}; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]; (4) a set of voiced [[obstruent]]s—{{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, and sometimes {{IPA|/ʝ/}}—which alternate between [[Approximant consonant|approximant]] and [[plosive]] allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the "[[Flap consonant|tapped]]" and "[[Trill consonant|trilled]]" ''r''-sounds (single {{angle bracket|r}} and double {{angle bracket|rr}} in orthography).

In the following table of consonant phonemes, {{IPA|/ʎ/}} is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with {{IPA|/ʝ/}} in the merger called {{lang|es|[[yeísmo]]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/θ/}} is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from {{IPA|/s/}} (see {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}}), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.

The phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in [[loanwords]]. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/ʝ/}}, and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} appears to the right of a ''pair'' of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the ''voiceless'' phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the ''voiced'' ones alternate [[Allophone|allophonically]] (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.

=== Prosody ===
Spanish is classified by its [[Isochrony|rhythm]] as a [[isochrony#syllable timing|syllable-timed language]]: each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Cressey|1978|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Abercrombie|1967|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] varies significantly according to dialect but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh-questions (who, what, why, etc.) and rising tone for [[Yes–no question|yes/no questions]].&lt;ref&gt;John B. Dabor, ''Spanish Pronunciation: Theory and Practice'' (3rd ed.: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1997), Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/academic/liberal_arts/foreign/Spanish/FLSP0501/dalvofile.html |title=John B. Dalbor's Voice Files to Accompany ''Spanish Pronunciation'' |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=20 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308071525/http://www.auburn.edu/academic/liberal_arts/foreign/Spanish/FLSP0501/dalvofile.html |archivedate=8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no syntactic markers to distinguish between questions and statements and thus, the recognition of declarative or interrogative depends entirely on intonation.

Stress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word, with some rare exceptions at the fourth-last or earlier syllables. The ''tendencies'' of stress assignment are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.
* In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings {{lang|es|-n}} (for third-person-plural of verbs) and {{lang|es|-s}} (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus, regular ''verbs'' ending with {{lang|es|-n}} and the great majority of words ending with {{lang|es|-s}} are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are also stressed on the penult ({{lang|es|joven}}, {{lang|es|virgen}}, {{lang|es|mitin}}), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are stressed on their last syllable ({{lang|es|capitán}}, {{lang|es|almacén}}, {{lang|es|jardín}}, {{lang|es|corazón}}).
* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with [[clitic]] pronouns attached ({{lang|es|guardándoselos}} 'saving them for him/her/them/you').

In addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s that contrast solely on stress such as {{lang|es|sábana}} ('sheet') and {{lang|es|sabana}} ('savannah'); {{lang|es|límite}} ('boundary'), {{lang|es|limite}} ('[that] he/she limits') and {{lang|es|limité}} ('I limited'); {{lang|es|líquido}} ('liquid'), {{lang|es|liquido}} ('I sell off') and {{lang|es|liquidó}} ('he/she sold off').

The orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable. (See [[Spanish orthography]].)

In [[Africa]], Spanish is official (along with Portuguese and French) in [[Equatorial Guinea]], as well as an official language of the [[African Union]]. In Equatorial Guinea, Spanish is the predominant language when native and non-native speakers (around 500,000 people) are counted, while [[Fang language|Fang]] is the most spoken language by number of native speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Equatorial+Guinea |title=Equatorial Guinea (2000) |publisher=Ethnologue |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225145951/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=Equatorial%2BGuinea |archivedate=25 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ek.html |title=CIA World Factbook – Equatorial Guinea | date = 20 September 2007 | publisher =CIA |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish is also spoken in the integral territories of Spain in North Africa, which include the [[autonomous cities of Spain|Spanish cities]] of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], the [[Plazas de soberanía]], and the [[Canary Islands]] archipelago (population 2,000,000), located some {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} off the northwest coast of mainland Africa. In northern [[Morocco]], a former [[History of Morocco#European influence|Spanish protectorate]] that is also geographically close to Spain, approximately 20,000 people speak [[Spanish as a second language]], while Arabic is the ''de jure'' official language. A small number of Moroccan Jews also speak the Sephardic Spanish dialect [[Haketia]] (related to the [[Ladino language|Ladino]] dialect spoken in [[Israel]]). Spanish is spoken by some small communities in [[Angola]] because of the Cuban influence from the [[Cold War]] and in [[South Sudan]] among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned in time for their country's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Radio France International | language = Spanish| url = http://www.espanol.rfi.fr/africa/20110706-los-cubanos-la-elite-del-sudan-del-sur | title = Los cubanos, la élite de Sudán del Sur | accessdate = 20 December 2011 | place = FR | date = 6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western Sahara]], formerly [[Spanish Sahara]], Spanish was officially spoken during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Spanish was an official language of the [[Philippines]] from the beginning of Spanish administration in 1565 to a constitutional change in 1973. During [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish colonization]] (1565–1898), it was the language of government, trade and education, and spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos. In the mid-nineteenth century, the colonial government set up a free public education system with Spanish as the medium of instruction. This increased use of Spanish throughout the islands led to the formation of a class of Spanish-speaking intellectuals called the ''[[Ilustrados]]''. Until the Philippine independence in 1898, Spanish was spoken by around 10% of the population as their first and only language. Around 60% of the population spoke Spanish as their second or third language, that makes a total of 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| language=Spanish| url=http://buscoenlaces.es/kaibigankastila/rivera4.html |title=Estadisticas: El idioma español en Filipinas |publisher=Busco enlaces |location=ES |date=15 November 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite American administration after the defeat of Spain in the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, the usage of Spanish continued in Philippine literature and press during the early years of American administration. Gradually, however, the American government began increasingly promoting the use of English, and it characterized Spanish as a negative influence of the past. Eventually, by the 1920s, English became the primary language of administration and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20071204-104897/The_loss_of_Spanish |title=The loss of Spanish |first=[[Ambeth Ocampo|Ambeth]] |last=[[Ambeth Ocampo|Ocampo]]|date=4 December 2007 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer (INQUIRER.net)|location=Makati City, Philippines |at=Opinion |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rVMuCBJ8?url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20071204-104897/The_loss_of_Spanish |archivedate=26 July 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But despite a significant decrease in influence and speakers, Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines when it became independent in 1946, alongside English and [[Filipino language|Filipino]], a standardized version of [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

== Dialectal variation ==
[[File:Variedades principales del español.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A world map attempting to identify the main dialects of Spanish.]]
{{Main|Spanish dialects and varieties}}
There are important variations ([[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]]) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.

The variety with the most speakers is [[Mexican Spanish]]. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] or loss of [[unstressed vowel]]s, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2'', pp.154–155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=Mexican+vowels&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=Mexican%20vowels&amp;f=false URL]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lope Blanch, Juan M. (1972) ''En torno a las vocales caedizas del español mexicano'', pp.53 a 73, Estudios sobre el español de México, editorial Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, México [http://www.filos.unam.mx/LICENCIATURA/Pagina_FyF_2004/introduccion/Lope_Vocales_caedizas.pdf URL].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard, although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last 50 years. Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as [[yeísmo]] and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006 |publisher= Random House Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998 |publisher= MICRA, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQf5Tmd?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The educated Madrid variety has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= ''whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonology ===
The four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|{{IPA|/θ/}}]] ("theta"), (2) the [[debuccalization]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, (3) the sound of the spelled {{angle bracket|s}}, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|{{IPA|/ʎ/}}]] ("turned ''y''"),&lt;ref&gt;The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol "turned ''y''" (ʎ), with its "tail" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (λ), whose tail leans to the left.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The phoneme {{IPA|/θ/}} (spelled {{lang|es|c}} before {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}} and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} elsewhere), a [[voiceless dental fricative]] as in English '''''th'''ing'', is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the [[Canary Islands]], and the Americas), {{IPA|/θ/}} doesn't exist and {{IPA|/s/}} occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called {{lang|es|[[distinción]]}} in Spanish, while the merger is generally called {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}} (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as {{IPA|[s]}}) or, occasionally, {{lang|es|[[ceceo]]}} (referring to its interdental realization, {{IPA|[θ]}}, in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} is always pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]].
* The debuccalization (pronunciation as {{IPA|[h]}}, or loss) of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called "aspiration" in English, and {{lang|es|aspiración}} in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless "apico-alveolar" sibilant]] or as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.
* The sound that corresponds to the letter {{angle bracket|s}} is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless "apico-alveolar" sibilant]] {{IPA|[s̺]}} (also described acoustically as "[[Grave and acute|grave]]" and articulatorily as "retracted"), with a weak "hushing" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. In [[Andalusia]], [[Canary Islands]] and most of Hispanic America (except in the [[Colombian Spanish#Paisa dialect|Paisa region]] of Colombia) it is pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. Because /s/ is one of the most frequent phonemes in Spanish, the difference of pronunciation is one of the first to be noted by a Spanish-speaking person to differentiate Spaniards from Spanish-speakers of the Americas. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}
* The phoneme {{IPA|/ʎ/}} spelled {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]] consonant sometimes compared in sound to the sound of the {{angle bracket|lli}} of English ''million'', tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in [[Andean Spanish|highland areas of South America]]. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers, it is merged with {{IPA|/ʝ/}} ("curly-tail ''j''"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English {{IPA|/j/}} (''yod'') as in '''''y'''acht'' and spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled {{angle bracket|ll}} and the spelled {{angle bracket|y}} is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called {{lang|es|[[yeísmo]]}} in Spanish. In [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (as in English ''measure'' or the French {{angle bracket|j}}) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region ({{lang|es|zheísmo}}), or voiceless {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (as in the French {{angle bracket|ch}} or Portuguese {{angle bracket|x}}) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ({{lang|es|sheísmo}}).&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Chang, [http://www.lingref.com/cpp/wss/4/paper1755.pdf "Variation in palatal production in Buenos Aires Spanish"]. Selected Proceedings of the 4th Workshop on Spanish Sociolinguistics, ed. Maurice Westmoreland and Juan Antonio Thomas, 54–63. Somerville, MA: Cascadilla Proceedings Project, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morphology ===
The main [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns, especially those of the second [[Grammatical person|person]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[object pronoun]]s of the third [[Grammatical person|person]].

==== Voseo ====
{{Main|Voseo}}
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
[[File:Voseo-extension-real.PNG|thumb|upright=1.15|An examination of the dominance and stress of the voseo dialect in Hispanic America. Data generated as illustrated by the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]. The darker the area, the stronger its dominance.]]

Virtually all dialects of Spanish make the [[T–V distinction|distinction]] between a formal and a familiar [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] in the [[Grammatical person|second-person]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] and thus have two different [[pronoun]]s meaning "you": {{lang|es|usted}} in the formal and either {{lang|es|tú}} or {{lang|es|vos}} in the familiar (and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms), with the choice of {{lang|es|tú}} or {{lang|es|vos}} varying from one dialect to another. The use of {{lang|es|vos}} (and/or its verb forms) is called {{lang|es|[[voseo]]}}. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with {{lang|es|usted}}, {{lang|es|tú}}, and {{lang|es|vos}} denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.&lt;ref name="rae.es site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Española |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{lang|es|voseo}}, {{lang|es|vos}} is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] form ({{lang|es|vos decís}}, "you say") and the form for the object of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ({{lang|es|voy con vos}}, "I am going with you"), while the direct and indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] forms, and the [[Possessive adjective|possessives]], are the same as those associated with {{lang|es|tú}}: {{lang|es|Vos sabés que tus amigos te respetan}} ("You know your friends respect you").

The verb forms of ''general voseo'' are the same as those used with {{lang|es|tú}} except in the present [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[indicative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) verbs. The forms for {{lang|es|vos}} generally can be derived from those of {{lang|es|vosotros}} (the traditional second-person familiar ''plural'') by deleting the [[semivowel|glide]] {{IPA|[i̯]}}, or {{IPA|/d/}}, where it appears in the ending: {{lang|es|vosotros pensá'''i'''s}} &gt; {{lang|es|vos pensás}}; {{lang|es|vosotros volvé'''i'''s}} &gt; {{lang|es|vos volvés}}, {{lang|es|pensa'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) &gt; {{lang|es|pensá!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}), {{lang|es|volve'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) &gt; {{lang|es|volvé!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}) .

The use of the pronoun {{lang|es|vos}} with the verb forms of {{lang|es|tú}} ({{lang|es|vos piensas}}) is called "pronominal {{lang|es|voseo}}". Conversely, the use of the verb forms of {{lang|es|vos}} with the pronoun {{lang|es|tú}} ({{lang|es|tú pensás}} or {{lang|es|tú pensái}}) is called "verbal {{lang|es|voseo}}". &lt;br /&gt;
In Chile, for example, ''verbal voseo'' is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun ''vos'', which is usually reserved for highly informal situations.

And in Central American {{lang|es|voseo}}, one can see even further distinction.

===== Distribution in Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas =====
Although {{lang|es|vos}} is not used in Spain, it occurs in many Spanish-speaking regions of the Americas as the primary spoken form of the second-person singular familiar pronoun, with wide differences in social consideration. Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of {{lang|es|tuteo}} (the use of {{lang|es|tú}}) in the following areas: almost all of [[Mexico]], the West Indies, [[Panama]], most of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and coastal [[Ecuador]].

{{lang|es|Tuteo}} as a cultured form alternates with {{lang|es|voseo}} as a popular or rural form in [[Bolivia]], in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]]), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that {{lang|es|voseo}} can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.&lt;ref&gt;Katia Salamanca de Abreu, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/28/TH_28_001_138_0.pdf review of Humberto López Morales, ''Estudios sobre el español de Cuba''] (New York: Editorial Las Américas, 1970), in ''Thesaurus'', 28 (1973), 138–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lang|es|Tuteo}} exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar {{lang|es|voseo}} in [[Chile]], in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]], on the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], in the [[Azuero Peninsula]] in Panama, in the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], and in parts of Guatemala.

Areas of generalized {{lang|es|voseo}} include [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], eastern [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the Colombian departments of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and [[Valle del Cauca]].&lt;ref name="rae.es site" /&gt;

==== Ustedes ====
{{lang|es|Ustedes}} functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Hispanic America, the [[Canary Islands]], and some regions of [[Andalusia]]. In [[Seville]], [[Huelva]], [[Cadiz]], and other parts of western [[Andalusia]], the familiar form is constructed as {{lang|es|ustedes vais}}, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the [[T-V distinction|formal/familiar distinction]] with {{lang|es|ustedes}} and {{lang|es|vosotros}} respectively.

==== Usted ====
{{lang|es|Usted}} is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority ("you, sir"/"you, ma'am"). It is also used in a ''familiar'' context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of {{lang|es|tú}} or {{lang|es|vos}}. This usage is sometimes called {{lang|es|[[:es:Ustedeo|ustedeo]]}} in Spanish.

In Central America, especially in Honduras, {{lang|es|usted}} is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. {{lang|es|Usted}} is also used that way as well as between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.

==== Third-person object pronouns ====
Most speakers use (and the {{lang|es|[[Real Academia Española]]}} prefers) the pronouns {{lang|es|lo}} and {{lang|es|la}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''direct'' objects]] (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of [[animacy]], meaning "him", "her", or "it"), and {{lang|es|le}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''indirect'' objects]] (regardless of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[animacy]], meaning "to him", "to her", or "to it"). The usage is sometimes called "etymological", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Dative case|dative]] pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.

Deviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called "{{lang|es|[[leísmo]]}}", "{{lang|es|[[loísmo]]}}", or "{{lang|es|[[laísmo]]}}", according to which respective pronoun, {{lang|es|le}}, {{lang|es|lo}}, or {{lang|es|la}}, has expanded beyond the etymological usage ({{lang|es|le}} as a direct object, or {{lang|es|lo}} or {{lang|es|la}} as an indirect object).

=== Vocabulary ===
Some words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish {{lang|es|mantequilla}}, {{lang|es|aguacate}} and {{lang|es|albaricoque}} (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to {{lang|es|manteca}} (word used for [[lard]] in [[Peninsular Spanish]]), {{lang|es|palta}}, and {{lang|es|damasco}}, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except {{lang|es|manteca}}), Paraguay, Peru (except {{lang|es|manteca}} and {{lang|es|damasco}}), and Uruguay.

== Relation to other languages ==
{{further|Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish}}
[[File:Llengües d'Espanya.svg|thumb|Linguistic map of Spain with Spanish shown in light green. ]]
Spanish is closely related to the other [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance languages]], including [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

It is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jensen|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=501}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ginsburgh|Weber|2011|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mutual intelligibility]] of the ''written'' Spanish and Portuguese languages is remarkably high, and the difficulties of the spoken forms are based more on phonology than on grammatical and lexical dissimilarities. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' gives estimates of the [[lexical similarity]] between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%. Italian, on the other hand its phonology similar to Spanish, but has a lower lexical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and [[French language|French]] or between Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.&lt;ref name="ethnologue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|work=Ethnologue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ezglot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=spa|title=Similar languages to Spanish|work=EZGlot}}&lt;/ref&gt; And comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.

7. Romanian ''caș'' (from Latin {{smallcaps|cāsevs}}) means a type of cheese. The universal term for cheese in Romanian is ''brânză'' (from unknown etymology).&lt;ref&gt;Often considered to be a substratum word. Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin ''brandeum'' (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *''brandea''. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish ''manteca'', Portuguese ''manteiga'', probably from Latin ''mantica'' ('sack'), Italian ''formaggio'' and French ''fromage'' from ''formaticus''.

=== Judaeo-Spanish ===
{{Further|Judaeo-Spanish}}
[[File:Rashiscript.PNG|thumb|The [[Rashi script]], originally used to print Judaeo-Spanish.]]
[[File:Delacroix_letter.png|thumb|upright=0.85|An original letter in Haketia, written in 1832.]]

Judaeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino,&lt;ref name="Ladino"&gt;{{cite web |last=Alfassa |first=Shelomo |title=Ladinokomunita |url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/quickladino.html |date=December 1999 |publisher=Foundation for the Advancement of Sephardic Studies and Culture |accessdate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a variety of Spanish which preserves many features of medieval Spanish and Portuguese and is spoken by descendants of the [[Sephardi Jews]] who were [[Alhambra decree|expelled from Spain in the fifteenth century]].&lt;ref name="Ladino" /&gt; Conversely, in Portugal the vast majority of the Portuguese Jews converted and became 'New Christians'. Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the [[Yiddish language]] to [[German language|German]]. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively [[Sephardim|Sephardi]] Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.&lt;ref name="Ladino" /&gt; Judaeo-Spanish lacks the [[Amerindian languages|Native American vocabulary]] which was acquired by standard Spanish during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], French, Greek and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.

Judaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly ''olim'' (immigrants to [[Israel]]) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.

A related dialect is [[Haketia]], the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.

== Writing system ==
{{Main|Spanish orthography}}
{{Spanish language}}
Spanish is written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of the character {{angle bracket|[[ñ]]}} ({{lang|es|eñe}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|ɲ]]/}}, a letter distinct from {{angle bracket|n}}, although typographically composed of an {{angle bracket|n}} with a [[tilde]]). Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}) and {{angle bracket|ll}} ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal lateral approximant|ʎ]]/}}), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph {{angle bracket|rr}} ({{lang|es|erre fuerte}}, 'strong r', {{lang|es|erre doble}}, 'double r', or simply {{lang|es|erre}}), which also represents a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|ll}} have been treated as letter pairs for [[collation]] purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with {{angle bracket|ch}} are now alphabetically sorted between those with {{angle bracket|cg}} and {{angle bracket|ci}}, instead of following {{angle bracket|cz}} as they used to. The situation is similar for {{angle bracket|ll}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=ch Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas], 1st ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.es/ Real Academia Española], [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html Explanation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }} at [http://www.spanishpronto.com/ Spanish Pronto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002335/https://www.spanishpronto.com/ |date=14 September 2007 }} {{es icon}}, {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:

:{{lang|es|A, B, C,&lt;!-- ch considered digraph - see next references. --&gt; D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,&lt;!-- ll considered digraph - see next references. --&gt; M, N, Ñ, O, P, Q, R, &lt;!-- but not rr See previous paragraph. --&gt; S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.}}

Since 2010, none of the digraphs ({{lang|es|ch, ll, rr, gu, qu}}) is considered a letter by the Spanish Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.es/consultas/exclusion-de-ch-y-ll-del-abecedario Exclusión de ch y ll del abecedario, RAE]&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters {{lang|es|k}} and {{lang|es|w}} are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages ({{lang|es|kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi}}, etc.).

With the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as {{lang|es|[[México]]}} (see [[Toponymy of Mexico#Phonetic evolution|Toponymy of Mexico]]), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the [[syllable]] before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including {{angle bracket|y}}) or with a vowel followed by {{angle bracket|n}} or an {{angle bracket|s}}; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an [[acute accent]] on the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]].

The acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain [[homophone]]s, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a [[clitic]]: compare {{lang|es|el}} ('the', masculine singular definite article) with {{lang|es|él}} ('he' or 'it'), or {{lang|es|te}} ('you', object pronoun) with {{lang|es|té}} ('tea'), {{lang|es|de}} (preposition 'of') versus {{lang|es|dé}} ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and {{lang|es|se}} (reflexive pronoun) versus {{lang|es|sé}} ('I know' or imperative 'be').

The interrogative pronouns ({{lang|es|qué}}, {{lang|es|cuál}}, {{lang|es|dónde}}, {{lang|es|quién}}, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ({{lang|es|ése}}, {{lang|es|éste}}, {{lang|es|aquél}}, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of [[typewriter]]s and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the {{lang|es|Real Academia Española}} advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.

When {{lang|es|u}} is written between {{lang|es|g}} and a front vowel {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}}, it indicates a "[[Hard and soft G|hard g]]" pronunciation. A [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] {{lang|es|ü}} indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., {{lang|es|cigüeña}}, 'stork', is pronounced {{IPA|[θiˈɣweɲa]}}; if it were written *{{lang|es|cigueña}}, it would be pronounced *{{IPA|[θiˈɣeɲa]}}).

Interrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with [[inverted question and exclamation marks]] ({{lang|es|¿}} and {{lang|es|¡}}, respectively).

[[File:Banco Español del Río de la Plata (Madrid) 05.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cervantes Institute]] headquarters, [[Madrid]]]]
The {{lang|es|Instituto Cervantes}} (Cervantes Institute) is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branched out in over 20 different countries, with 54 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The Institute's 2015 report "El español, una lengua viva" (Spanish, a living language) estimates that there are 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Burgen, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country US now has more Spanish speakers than Spain – only Mexico has more], US News, 29 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White privilege''' (or '''white skin privilege''') is the [[Privilege (social inequality)|societal privilege]] that benefits people whom society identifies as [[white people|white]] in some countries, beyond what is commonly experienced by [[non-white]] people under the same social, political, or economic circumstances. Academic perspectives such as [[critical race theory]] and [[whiteness studies]] use the concept to analyze how [[racism]] and [[racialized society|racialized societies]] affect the lives of white or white-skinned people.

According to [[Peggy McIntosh]], whites in Western societies enjoy advantages that non-whites do not experience, as "an invisible package of unearned assets".&lt;ref name="Unpacking"/&gt; White privilege denotes both obvious and less obvious passive advantages that white people may not recognize they have, which distinguishes it from overt bias or prejudice. These include cultural affirmations of one's own worth; presumed greater social status; and [[freedom to move]], buy, work, play, and [[speak freely]]. The effects can be seen in professional, educational, and personal contexts. The concept of white privilege also implies the right to assume the universality of one's own experiences, marking others as different or exceptional while perceiving oneself as [[Normality (behavior)|normal]].&lt;ref name=Vice&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vice |first=Samantha |title=How Do I Live in This Strange Place? |journal=Journal of Social Philosophy |date=September 7, 2010 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=323–342 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2010.01496.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin-McDonald |first=K |author2=McCarthy, A |title='Marking' the white terrain in indigenous health research: literature review. |journal=Journal of advanced nursing |date=January 2008 |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=126–33 |pmid=18186904 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.2007.04438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has attracted attention as well as opposition. Some critics say that the term uses the concept of "whiteness" as a proxy for [[Social class|class]] or other social privilege or as a distraction from deeper underlying problems of inequality.&lt;ref name=Arnesen&gt;{{cite journal |first=Eric |last=Arnesen |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=92975&amp;fileId=S0147547901004380 |title=Whiteness and the Historians' Imagination |journal=International Labor and Working-Class History |volume=60 |date=October 2001 |pages=3–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartigan, 2005 pp. 1"&gt;Hartigan, ''Odd Tribes'' (2005), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Others state that it is not that whiteness is a proxy but that many other social privileges are interconnected with it, requiring complex and careful analysis to identify how whiteness contributes to privilege.&lt;ref name="Privilege"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = Lawrence | year = 2008 | title = 'White Privilege': A Mild Critique1 | url = | journal = Theory and Research in Education | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 309–321 | doi = 10.1177/1477878508095586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the concept of white privilege also propose alternative definitions of whiteness and exceptions to or limits of white identity, arguing that the concept of white privilege ignores important differences between white [[Statistical population|subpopulations]] and individuals and suggesting that the notion of whiteness cannot be inclusive of all white people.&lt;ref name="uws.edu.au"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forrest |first1=James |last2=Dunn |first2=Kevin |title='Core' Culture Hegemony and Multiculturalism |journal=Ethnicities |date=June 2006 |volume=6 |number=2 |doi=10.1177/1468796806063753 |url=http://www.uws.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/29645/A23.pdf |pages=203–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blum 309–321"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blum |first=L. |title='White privilege': A Mild Critique |journal=[[Theory and Research in Education]] |date=November 1, 2008 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=309–321 |publisher=SAGE Publications |doi=10.1177/1477878508095586 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They note the problem of acknowledging the diversity of people of color and ethnicity within these groups.&lt;ref name="Privilege"/&gt; [[Conservatism|Conservative]] critics have offered more direct critiques of the concept; [[Shelby Steele]] writes that "today&amp;nbsp;... the lives of minorities are no longer stunted by either prejudice or 'white privilege'",&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shame: How America's Past Sins Have Polarized Our Country |last=Steele |first=Shelby |authorlink= Shelby Steele|publisher=Basic Books |year=2015 |pages=26|isbn=978-0465066971}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[The Federalist (website)|Federalist]] contributor David Marcus says that the concept is an obstacle in the road to achieving an equal society.&lt;ref name=Marcus&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marcus|first1=David|title=Privilege Theory Destroys The American Ideal Of Equality|url=http://thefederalist.com/2015/03/10/privilege-theory-destroys-the-american-ideal-of-equality|website=The Federalist|date=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers have noted that the "academic-sounding concept of white privilege" sometimes elicits defensiveness and misunderstanding among white people, in part due to how the concept of white privilege was rapidly brought into the mainstream spotlight through [[social media]] campaigns such as [[Black Lives Matter]].&lt;ref name=brydum&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brydum |first1=Sunnivie |title=The Year in Hashtags: 2014 |url=http://www.advocate.com/year-review/2014/12/31/year-hashtags |accessdate=January 23, 2016 |agency=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |date=December 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cory Weinburg, writing for ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]'', has also said that the concept of white privilege is frequently misinterpreted by non-academics because it is an academic concept that has recently been brought into the mainstream. Academics interviewed by Weinburg, who have been otherwise studying white privilege undisturbed for decades, have been surprised by the seemingly-sudden hostility from [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] critics since approximately 2014.&lt;ref name=weinburg&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinburg |first1=Cory |title=The White Privilege Moment |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/28/academics-who-study-white-privilege-experience-attention-and-criticism |accessdate=January 19, 2016 |agency=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although the definition of "white privilege" has been somewhat fluid, it is generally agreed to refer to the implicit or systemic advantages that white people have relative to people who are the objects of racism; it is the absence of suspicion and other negative reactions that people who are objects of racism experience.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, H., Worthington, R., Spanierman, L. (2001). Race, Power, and Multicultural Counseling Psychology: Understanding White Privilege and Color Blind Racial Attitudes. In Ponterotto, J., Casas, M, Suzuki, L, and Alexander, C. (Eds) Handbook of Multicultural Counseling, Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is the flipside of racism and is used in discussions focused on the mostly hidden benefits that white people possess in a society where racism is prevalent and whiteness is considered normal, rather than on the detriments to people who are the objects of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2000 |last1=Pulido |first1=L. |doi=10.1111/0004-5608.00182 |title=Rethinking Environmental Racism: White Privilege and Urban Development in Southern California |journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers |volume=90 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andersen |first1=Chris |title=Critical Indigenous Studies in the Classroom: Exploring ‘the Local’ using Primary Evidence |journal=International Journal of Critical Indigenous Studies |date=2012 |volume=5 |issue=1 |url=http://www.isrn.qut.edu.au/publications/internationaljournal/documents/Final_Anderson_IJCIS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, most definitions and discussions of the concept use as a starting point McIntosh's metaphor of the "invisible backpack" that white people unconsciously "wear" in a society where racism is prevalent.&lt;ref name=Marcus2017&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marcus |first1=David |title=A Conservative Defense of Privilege Theory |url=https://www.weeklystandard.com/david-marcus/a-conservative-defense-of-privilege-theory |work=The Weekly Standard |date=6 November 2017 |language=en |quote=First described by Peggy McIntosh in the late 1980s, white privilege basically describes somewhat hidden advantages that white people in our society enjoy, that they did not earn.

==History of the concept==

===Pre-1970s===
In his 1935 ''[[Black Reconstruction|Black Reconstruction in America]]'', [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] introduced the concept of a "psychological wage" for white laborers. This special status, he wrote, divided the labor movement by leading low-wage white workers to feel superior to low-wage black workers.&lt;ref name=DuBois/&gt; Du Bois identified [[white supremacy]] as a global phenomenon, affecting the social conditions across the world by means of colonialism.&lt;ref name=Leonardo&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leonardo | first1 = Zeus | year = 2010| title = The Souls of White Folk: critical pedagogy, whiteness studies, and globalization discourse | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13613320120117180 | journal = Race Ethnicity and Education | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 2002 | doi = 10.1080/13613320120117180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, Du Bois wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It must be remembered that the white group of laborers, while they received a low wage, were compensated in part by a sort of public and psychological wage. They were given public deference and titles of courtesy because they were white. They were admitted freely with all classes of white people to public functions, public parks, and the best schools. The police were drawn from their ranks, and the courts, dependent on their votes, treated them with such leniency as to encourage lawlessness. Their vote selected public officials, and while this had small effect upon the economic situation, it had great effect upon their personal treatment and the deference shown them. White schoolhouses were the best in the community, and conspicuously placed, and they cost anywhere from twice to ten times as much per capita as the colored schools. The newspapers specialized on news that flattered the poor whites and almost utterly ignored the Negro except in crime and ridicule.&lt;ref name=DuBois&gt;W. E. B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'' (New York: Free Press, 1995 reissue of 1935 original), pp. 700–701. {{ISBN|0-684-85657-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965, drawing from that insight, and inspired by the [[civil rights movement]], [[Theodore W. Allen]] began a 40-year analysis of "white skin privilege", "white race" privilege, and "white" privilege in a call he drafted for a "John Brown Commemoration Committee" that urged "White Americans who want government of the people" and "by the people" to "begin by first repudiating their white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, "A Call . . . John Brown Memorial Pilgrimage . . . December 4, 1965," John Brown Commemoration Committee, 1965 and Jeffrey B. Perry, [http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html "The Developing Conjuncture and Some Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W. Allen on the Centrality of the Fight against White Supremacy,"] "Cultural Logic" 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The pamphlet, "White Blindspot", containing one essay by Allen and one by historian [[Noel Ignatiev]], was published in the late 1960s. It focused on the struggle against "white skin privilege" and significantly influenced the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) and sectors of the [[New Left]]. By June 15, 1969, the ''New York Times'' was reporting that the National Office of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) was calling "for an all-out fight against 'white skin privileges'".&lt;ref&gt;See Noel Ignatin (Ignatiev) and Ted (Theodore W.) Allen, [http://www.sds-1960s.org/WhiteBlindspot.pdf "'White Blindspot' and 'Can White Workers Radicals Be Radicalized?'"] (Detroit: The Radical Education Project and New York: NYC Revolutionary Youth Movement, 1969); Thomas R. Brooks, [https://www.nytimes.com/1969/06/15/archives/the-new-left-is-showing-its-age-the-new-left-is-showing-its-age.html "The New Left is Showing Its Age,"] "New York Times," June 15, 1969, p. 20; and Perry, "The Developing Conjuncture and Some Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W. Allen. . . "&lt;/ref&gt; From 1974 to 1975, Allen extended his analysis to the [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] period, leading to the publication of "Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race,"&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race] (Hoboken: Hoboken Education Project, 1975), republished in 2006 with an "Introduction" by Jeffrey B. Perry at Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook.&lt;/ref&gt; (1975) which ultimately grew into his two-volume "The Invention of the White Race" in 1994 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, The Invention of the White Race, Vol. I: Racial Oppression and Social Control (New York: Verso, 1994, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-84467-769-6}}) and Vol. II: The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America (New York: Verso, 1997, 2012 {{ISBN|978-1-84467-770-2}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work, Allen maintained several points: that the "white race" was invented as a ruling class [[social control]] formation in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century Anglo-American plantation colonies (principally Virginia and Maryland); that central to this process was the ruling-class plantation bourgeoisie conferring "white race" privileges on European-American working people; that these privileges were not only against the interests of African-Americans, they were also "poison," "ruinous," a baited hook, to the class interests of working people; that white supremacy, reinforced by the "white skin privilege," has been as the main retardant of working-class consciousness in the US; and that struggle for radical social change should direct principal efforts at challenging white supremacy and "white skin privileges".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey B. Perry, [http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html "The Developing Conjuncture and Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W. Allen on the Centrality of the Fight Against White Supremacy,"] "Cultural Logic,'" July 2010, pp. 10–11, 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Allen's work influenced Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and sectors of the "new left" and paved the way for "white privilege" and "race as social construct" study, and though he appreciated much of the work that followed, he also raised important questions about developments in those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://clogic.eserver.org/1-2/allen.html "Summary of the Argument of The Invention of the White Race", Part 1], #8, Cultural Logic, I, No. 2 (Spring 1998) and Jeffrey B. Perry, [http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html "The Developing Conjuncture and Insights from Hubert Harrison and Theodore W. Allen on the Centrality of the Fight Against White Supremacy"]. ''Cultural Logic''. July 2010, pp. 8, 80–89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In newspapers and public discourse across the United States in the 1960s, the term "white privilege" was often used to describe white areas under conditions of [[residential segregation]]. These and other uses grew out of the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|legal discrimination]] against Black Americans, and reflected the idea that white status could continue despite formal equality.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In the 1990s, the term came back into public discourse, such as in [[Robert W. Jensen|Robert Jensen]]'s 1998 opinion piece in the [[The Baltimore Sun|''Baltimore Sun'']], titled "White privilege shapes the U.S."&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;Jensen, Robert, [http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/whiteprivilege.htm "White privilege shapes the U.S."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612133025/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/whiteprivilege.htm |date=June 12, 2011 }} ''Baltimore Sun'', July 19, 1998, p.C-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s to early 2000s===

The concept of white privilege also came to be used within radical circles for purposes of self-criticism by [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] whites. For instance, a 1975 article in ''[[Lesbian Tide]]'' criticized the American feminist movement for exhibiting "class privilege" and "white privilege".  [[Weather Underground]] leader [[Bernardine Dohrn]], in a 1977 ''Lesbian Tide'' article, wrote: "... by assuming that I was beyond white privilege or allying with male privilege because I understood it, I prepared and led the way for a totally opportunist direction which infected all of our work and betrayed revolutionary principles."&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Jacob Bennett, "White Privilege: A History of the Concept", Master’s Thesis at Georgia State University, May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, the term gained new popularity in academic circles and public discourse after [[Peggy McIntosh]]'s 1987 essay [[Peggy McIntosh#Invisible knapsack|''White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack'']].&lt;ref name=newyorker&gt;{{cite news|last=Rothman|first=Joshua|title=The Origins of "Privilege"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2014/05/the-woman-who-coined-the-term-white-privilege.html|accessdate=May 14, 2014|newspaper=[[The New Yorker]]|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, McIntosh described white privilege as “an invisible weightless knapsack of assurances, tools, maps, guides, codebooks, passports, visas, clothes, compass, emergency gear, and blank checks," and also discussed the relationships between different social hierarchies in which experiencing oppression in one hierarchy did not negate unearned privilege experienced in another.&lt;ref name="Unpacking"&gt;{{cite web|first1=Peggy|last1=McIntosh|title=White privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack|url=http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/jsibbett/readings/White_Privilege.pdf}} Independent School, Winter90, Vol. 49 Issue 2, p31, 5p&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McIntosh, Peggy. ''White Privilege and Male Privilege: A Personal Account of Coming to See Correspondences Through Work in Women’s Studies.'' Wellesley: Center for Research on Women, 1988. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the theory of [[intersectionality]] also gained prominence, with black feminists like [[Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw]] arguing that black women experienced a different type of oppression from [[male privilege]] distinct from that experienced by white women because of white privilege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Sheila | last2 = Crenshaw | first2 = Kimberlé | author-link2 = Kimberlé Crenshaw | title = Intersectionality: the double bind of race and gender | work = Perspectives Magazine | date = Spring 2004 | page = 2 | publisher = [[American Bar Association]] | url = http://www.americanbar.org/publications/perspectives_magazine_home/perspectives_magazine_index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay is still routinely cited as a key influence by later generations of academics and journalists.&lt;ref name=crosley-corcoran&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crosley-Corcoran|first1=Gina|title=Explaining White Privilege to a Broke White Person|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gina-crosleycorcoran/explaining-white-privilege-to-a-broke-white-person_b_5269255.html|accessdate=January 19, 2016|agency=[[Huffington Post]]|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weinburg /&gt;

In 2003, Ella Bell and Stella Nkomo noted that "most scholars of race relations embrace the use of [the concept] white privilege".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ella L. J.|last1=Edmondson |first2=Stella M. |last2=Nkomo |title=Our Separate Ways: Black and White Women and the Struggle for Professional Identity|publisher=Harvard Business Review Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59139-189-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologists in the American Mosaic Project at the [[University of Minnesota]] reported that widespread belief in the United States that "prejudice and discrimination {{interp|in favor of whites}} create a form of white privilege." According to their 2003 poll, this view was affirmed by 59% of white respondents, 83% of Blacks, and 84% of Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=American Mosaic Project

===Social media era===
White privilege as a concept marked its transition from academia to more mainstream prominence through [[social media]] in the early 2010s, especially in 2014, a year in which [[Black Lives Matter]] formed into a major movement and the word "hashtag" itself was added to [[Merriam-Webster]].&lt;ref name=brydum /&gt; Brandt and Kizer, in their article "From Street to Tweet" (2015), discuss the American public's perception of the concept of privilege in mainstream culture, including white privilege, as being influenced by social media, but also express caution as to its limits. Commenting on [[Kira Cochrane]]'s identification of [[fourth-wave feminism]], a proposed emerging movement characterized by use of technology and social media, they note that there are "large, splashy examples" of social media activism's reach, but "on an individual level ... the influence and reach of social media is unclear".&lt;ref name="brandt-kizer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Jenn|last2=Kizer|first2=Sam|title=From Street to Tweet: Popular Culture and Feminist Activism|publisher=SensePublishers|isbn=978-94-6300-061-1|pages=115–127|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-6300-061-1_9|accessdate=February 15, 2016|doi=10.1007/978-94-6300-061-1_9|chapter=From Street to Tweet|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hua Hsu]], a [[Vassar College]] professor of English, opened his ''[[The New Yorker]]'' review of the 2015 [[MTV]] film [[White People (film)|''White People'']] with the remark: "like the robot in a movie slowly discovering that it is, indeed, a robot, it feels as though we are living in the moment when white people, on a generational scale, have become self-aware".&lt;ref name="huahsu-ny"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hsu|first1=Hua|title=The Trouble with "White People"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-trouble-with-white-people|accessdate=February 15, 2016|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that "white people have begun to understand themselves in the explicit terms of identity politics, long the province of those on the margins", Hsu ascribes this change in self-awareness to a generational change, "one of strange byproducts of the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] era". Hsu writes that discourse on the nature of whiteness "isn't a new discussion, by any means, but it has never seemed quite so animated".&lt;ref name="huahsu-ny" /&gt;

The film ''White People'' itself, produced and directed by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Jose Antonio Vargas]], is a documentary that follows a variety of white teenagers who express their honest thoughts and feelings about their whiteness on-camera, as well as their opinions on white privilege. During one moment of the film, Vargas interviews a white community college student, Katy, who attributes her inability to land a college scholarship to [[reverse racism]] against white people, before Vargas points out that white students are "40 percent more likely to receive merit-based funding".&lt;ref name="amyzimmerman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmeman|first1=Amy|title=‘White People’: MTV Takes On White Privilege|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/20/white-people-mtv-takes-on-white-privilege.html|accessdate=February 16, 2016|agency=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one review of the film, a ''[[The Daily Beast|Daily Beast]]'' writer interviews Ronnie Cho, the head of MTV Public Affairs, who acknowledges "young people as the engine behind social change and awareness", and therefore would be more likely to talk about white privilege, but also notes that at the same time, [[millennials]] (with some overlap with [[Generation Z]]) form "a generation that maybe were raised with noble aspirations to be color blind". Ronnie Cho then asserts these aspirations "may not be very helpful if we ignore difference. The color of our skin does matter, and impacts how the world interacts with us." Later in the same review, writer Amy Zimmerman notes that, "white people often don't feel a pressing need to talk about race, because they don't experience it as racism and oppression, and therefore hardly experience it at all. [[Check your privilege|Checking privilege]] is an act of self-policing for white Americans; comparatively, black Americans are routinely over-checked by the literal police."&lt;ref name="amyzimmerman" /&gt;

In January 2016, hip-hop group [[Macklemore and Ryan Lewis]] released "[[White Privilege II]]", a single from their album ''[[This Unruly Mess I've Made]]'', in which [[Macklemore]] raps about his struggle to find his place in the Black Lives Matter protest movement, conscious that his commercial success in [[hip hop]] is at least partially a product of white privilege.

==Applications in critical theory==

===Critical race theory===
:{{Main|Critical race theory}}

The concept of white privilege has been studied by theorists of [[whiteness studies]] seeking to examine the construction and moral implications of 'whiteness'. There is often overlap between critical whiteness and race theories, as demonstrated by focus on the legal and historical construction of white identity, and the use of narratives (whether legal discourse, testimony or fiction) as a tool for exposing systems of racial power.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Haney López, Ian F. ''White by Law''. 1995; Lipsitz, George. ''Possessive Investment in Whiteness''; Delgado, Richard; Williams, Patricia; and Kovel, Joel.&lt;/ref&gt; Fields such as History and Cultural Studies are primarily responsible for the formative scholarship of Critical Whiteness Studies.

[[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] such as Cheryl Harris&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Cheryl I. |last=Harris|title=Whiteness as Property |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=106 |issue=8|pages=1709–95 |date=June 1993 |doi=10.2307/1341787 |publisher=Harvard Law Review, Vol. 106, No. 8|jstor=1341787}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Lipsitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Lipsitz |first=George| title= The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit From Identity Politics|year=2006 |publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia, PA |isbn= 1-59213-493-9|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PIqUajTEfk0C&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; have said that "whiteness" has historically been treated more as a form of [[property]] than as a racial characteristic: In other words, as an object which has intrinsic value that must be protected by social and legal institutions.  Laws and [[mores]] concerning race (from [[apartheid]] and [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] constructions that legally separate different races to social prejudices against interracial relationships or mixed communities) serve the purpose of retaining certain advantages and privileges for whites. Because of this, academic and societal ideas about race have tended to focus solely on the disadvantages suffered by [[racial minorities]], overlooking the advantageous effects that accrue to whites.&lt;ref name="Lucal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lucal|first=Betsy|date=July 1996|title=Oppression and Privilege: Toward a Relational Conceptualization of Race|journal=Teaching Sociology|publisher=American Sociological Association|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=24|issue=3|pages=245–55|issn=0092-055X|oclc=48950428|doi=10.2307/1318739|jstor=1318739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Arnesen]], an American labor historian, reviewed papers from a whiteness studies perspective published in his field in the 1990s, and found that the concept of whiteness was used so broadly during that time period that it wasn't useful.&lt;ref name=Arnesen/&gt;

===Whiteness unspoken===
From another perspective, white privilege is a way of conceptualizing racial inequalities that focuses on advantages that white people accrue from their position in society as well as the disadvantages that non-white people experience.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Constraint of Race'' (2004), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; This same idea is brought to light by Peggy McIntosh, who wrote about white privilege from the perspective of a white individual. McIntosh states in her writing that, "as a white person, I realized I had been taught about racism as something which puts others at a disadvantage, but had been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects, white privilege which puts me at an advantage".&lt;ref name="McIntosh, P. 1988 p. 1"&gt;McIntosh, P. (1988). "White privilege: Packing the invisible backpack. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; To back this assertion, McIntosh notes a myriad of conditions in her article in which racial inequalities occur to favor whites, from renting or buying a home in a given area without suspicion of one's financial standing, to purchasing bandages in "flesh" color that closely matches a white person's skin tone. She further asserts that she sees
&lt;blockquote&gt;a pattern running through the matrix of white privilege, a pattern of assumptions which were passed on to me as a white person. There was one main piece of cultural turf; it was my own turf, and I was among those who could control the turf. My skin color was an asset for any move I was educated to want to make. I could think of myself as belonging in major ways, and of making social systems work for me. I could freely disparage, fear, neglect, or be oblivious to anything outside of the dominant cultural forms. Being of the main culture, I could also criticize it fairly freely.&lt;ref name="McIntosh, P. 1988 p. 1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unjust enrichment===
Lawrence Blum refers to advantages for white people as "unjust enrichment" privileges, in which white people benefit from the injustices done to people of color, and he articulates that such privileges are deeply rooted in the U.S. culture and lifestyle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When Blacks are denied access to desirable homes, for example, this is not just an injustice to Blacks but a positive benefit to Whites who now have a wider range of domicile options than they would have if Blacks had equal access to housing. When urban schools do a poor job of educating their Latino/a and Black students, this benefits Whites in the sense that it unjustly advantages them in the competition for higher levels of education and jobs. Whites in general cannot avoid benefiting from the historical legacy of racial discrimination and oppression. So unjust enrichment is almost never absent from the life situation of Whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = L. | year = 2008 | title = White privilege: A mild critique". In | url = | journal = Theory and Research in Education | volume = 6 | issue = 309| page = 311 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Spared injustice===
[[File:Boston Protester White Privilege.jpg|thumb|upright|A protester holds a sign reading "They don't shoot white women like me" at a #BlackLivesMatter protest in the wake of the non-indictment of a New York City police officer for the [[death of Eric Garner]].]]
In Blum's analysis of the underlying structure of white privilege, "spared injustice" is when a person of color suffers an unjust treatment while a white person does not. His example of this is when "a Black person is stopped by the police without due cause but a White person is not".&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Blum | first = L. | year = 2008 | title = White privilege: A Mild Critique | url =http://tre.sagepub.com/content/6/3/309.abstract | journal = Theory and Research in Education | volume = 6 | issue = 309| pages=311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies "unjust enrichment" privileges as those for which whites are spared the injustice of a situation, and in turn, are benefiting from the injustice of others. For instance, "if police are too focused on looking for Black lawbreakers, they might be less vigilant toward White ones, conferring an unjust enrichment benefit on Whites who do break the laws but escape detection for this reason."&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312"/&gt;

===Privileges not related to injustice===
Blum describes "non-injustice-related" privileges as those which are not associated with injustices experienced by people of color, but relate to a majority group's advantages over a minority group. Those who are in the majority, usually white people, gain "unearned privileges not founded on injustice."&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312" /&gt; According to Blum, in workplace cultures there tends to be a partly ethnocultural character, so that some ethnic or racial groups' members find them more comfortable than do others.&lt;ref name="Blum, L. 2008 p. 311–312" /&gt;

===Framing racial inequality===
Dan J. Pence and J. Arthur Fields have observed resistance in the context of education to the idea that white privilege of this type exists, and suggest this resistance stems from a tendency to see inequality as a black or [[Latino]] issue. One report noted that white students often react to in-class discussions about white privilege with a continuum of behaviors ranging from outright hostility to a "wall of silence."&lt;ref name="Pence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pence|first=Dan J.|author2=Fields, J. Arthur|date=April 1999|title=Teaching about Race and Ethnicity: Trying to Uncover White Privilege for a White Audience|journal=Teaching Sociology|publisher=American Sociological Association|location=Washington, D.C.|volume=27|issue=2|pages=150–8|issn=0092-055X|oclc=48950428|doi=10.2307/1318701|jstor=1318701}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pair of studies on a broader population by Branscombe ''et al.'' found that framing racial issues in terms of white privilege as opposed to non-white disadvantages can produce a greater degree of racially biased responses from whites who have higher levels of racial identification. Branscombe ''et al.'' demonstrate that framing racial inequality in terms of the privileges of whites increased levels of guilt among white respondents.  Those with high racial identification were more likely to give responses which concurred with modern [[racist]] attitudes than those with low racial identification.&lt;ref name="Branscombe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Branscombe|first=Nyla R.|author2=Schmitt, Michael T.|author3=Schiffhauer, Kristin|date=August 25, 2006|title=Racial Attitudes in Response to Thoughts of White Privilege|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|volume=37|issue=2|pages=203–15|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/112771384/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|accessdate=July 19, 2008|doi=10.1002/ejsp.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the studies' authors, these findings suggest that representing inequality in terms of [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]] disadvantage allows privileged group members to avoid the negative implications of inequality.&lt;ref name="Powell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=Adam A.|author2=Branscombe, Nyla R.|author3=Schmitt, Michael T.|year=2005|title=Inequality as Ingroup Privilege or Outgroup Disadvantage: The Impact of Group Focus on Collective Guilt and Interracial Attitudes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.|volume=31|issue=4|pages=508–21|url=http://data.psych.udel.edu/abelcher/Shared%20Documents/6%20General%20Diversity%20Issues%20%2815%29/Powell.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522013408/http://data.psych.udel.edu/abelcher/Shared%20Documents/6%20General%20Diversity%20Issues%20%2815%29/Powell.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 22, 2013|accessdate=April 15, 2013|doi=10.1177/0146167204271713|pmid=15743985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White fragility===
[[Robin DiAngelo]] created the term "white fragility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anna-kegler/the-sugarcoated-language-of-white-fragility_b_10909350.html|title=The Sugarcoated Language Of White Fragility {{!}} Huffington Post|last=Feminist|first=Anna Kegler|last2=writer|date=July 22, 2016|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=September 30, 2016|last3=Nerd|first3=Messaging}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has noted that "white privilege can be thought of as unstable racial equilibrium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiAngelo|first1=Robin|title=White Fragility|journal=The Journal of International Critical Pedagogy|date=2011|volume=3|issue=3|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this equilibrium is challenged, the resulting racial stress can become intolerable and trigger a range of defensive responses. DiAngelo defines these behaviors as white fragility. For example, DiAngelo observed in her studies that some white people, when confronted with racial issues concerning white privilege,  may respond with dismissal, distress, or other defensive responses because they may feel personally implicated in white supremacy.&lt;ref name="Waldman18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lopez17"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lopez |first1=German |title=The Charlottesville protests are white fragility in action |url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/12/16138558/charlottesville-va-white-fragility |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=Vox |date=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also writes that white privilege is very rarely discussed and that even multicultural education courses tend to use vocabulary that further obfuscates racial privilege and defines race as something that only concerns blacks. She suggests using loaded terminology with negative connotations to people of color adds to the cycle of white privilege,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is far more the norm for these courses and programs to use racially coded language such as 'urban,' 'inner city,' and 'disadvantaged' but to rarely use 'white' or 'overadvantaged' or 'privileged.' This racially coded language reproduces racist images and perspectives while it simultaneously reproduces the comfortable illusion that race and its problems are what 'they' have, not us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiAngelo|first=Robin |title= White Fragility |journal= The International Journal of Critical Pedagogy |year= 2001 |pages= 54–70 |volume= 3 |issue= 3|url= https://libjournal.uncg.edu/index.php/ijcp/article/download/249/116 |accessdate= March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She does say, however, that defensiveness and discomfort from white people in response to being confronted with racial issues is not irrational but rather is often driven by subconscious, sometimes even well-meaning, attitudes toward racism.&lt;ref name="Waldman18"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Waldman |first1=Katy |title=A Sociologist Examines the “White Fragility” That Prevents White Americans from Confronting Racism |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/a-sociologist-examines-the-white-fragility-that-prevents-white-americans-from-confronting-racism |accessdate=12 October 2018 |work=The New Yorker |date=23 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gina Crosley-Corcoran in her ''[[The Huffington Post|Huffington Post]]'' article, "Explaining White Privilege to a Broke White Person", says that she was initially hostile to the idea that she had white privilege, initially believing, "my white skin didn't do shit to prevent me from experiencing poverty", until she was directed to read [[Peggy McIntosh]]'s "Unpacking the invisible knapsack". According to Crosley-Corcoran, "the concept of [[intersectionality]] recognizes that people can be privileged in some ways and definitely not privileged in others".&lt;ref name=crosley-corcoran /&gt;

==Global==
White privilege functions differently in different places. A person's white skin will not be an asset to them in every conceivable place or situation. White people are also a global minority, and this fact affects the experiences they have outside of their home areas. Nevertheless, some people who use the term "white privilege" describe it as a worldwide phenomenon, resulting from the history of colonialism by white Western Europeans. One author states that American white men are privileged almost everywhere in the world, even though many countries have never been colonized by Western Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Jacques]], "[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/race.uk The global hierarchy of race: As the only racial group that never suffers systemic racism, whites are in denial about its impact]", ''The Guardian'', September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merryfield | first1 = Merry M. | year = 2000 | title = Why aren't teachers being prepared to teach for diversity, equity, and global interconnectedness?

==In the United States==

===History===
Some scholars attribute white privilege, which they describe as informal racism, to the formal racism (i.e. [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] followed by [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]) that existed for much of American history.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, ''Constraint of Race'' (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America'', Stephanie M. Wildman writes that many Americans who advocate a merit-based, race-free worldview do not acknowledge the systems of privilege which have benefited them. For example, many Americans rely on a social or financial inheritance from previous generations, an inheritance unlikely to be forthcoming if one's ancestors were slaves.&lt;ref name="Wildman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wildman|first=Stephanie M.|author2=Armstrong, Margalynne|author3=Davis, Adrienne D.|author4=Grillo, Trina|title=Privilege Revealed: How Invisible Preference Undermines America|publisher=NYU Press|location=New York|year=1996|isbn=0-8147-9303-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LK-aQDstH6kC&amp;dq=Privilege+Revealed:+How+Invisible+Preference+Undermines+America&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whites were sometimes afforded opportunities and benefits that were unavailable to others.

===Wealth===
According to Roderick Harrison "wealth is a measure of cumulative advantage or disadvantage" and "the fact that black and Hispanic wealth is a fraction of white wealth also reflects a history of discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/18/national/18wealth.html Study Says White Families' Wealth Advantage Has Grown]." ''New York Times'' October 18, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Whites have historically had more opportunities to accumulate wealth.&lt;ref name=wealth&gt;{{cite book|author1=Melvin L. Oliver|author2=Thomas M.

Over the past 40 years, there has been less formal [[discrimination in the United States|discrimination in America]]; the [[Racial wealth gap in the United States|inequality in wealth between racial groups]] however, is still extant.&lt;ref name=wealth/&gt; George Lipsitz asserts that because wealthy whites were able to pass along their wealth in the form of inheritances and transformative assets (inherited wealth which lifts a family beyond their own achievements), white Americans on average continually accrue advantages.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|107–8}} Pre-existing disparities in wealth are exacerbated by tax policies that reward investment over waged income, subsidize mortgages, and subsidize private sector developers.&lt;ref name="Lipsitz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsitz|first=George|date=September 1995|title=The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: Racialized Social Democracy and the "White" Problem in American Studies|journal=American Quarterly|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=47|issue=3|pages=369–87|doi=10.2307/2713291|jstor=2713291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Shapiro wrote that wealth is passed along from generation to generation, giving whites a better "starting point" in life than other races. According to Shapiro, many whites receive financial assistance from their parents allowing them to live beyond their income. This, in turn, enables them to buy houses and major assets which aid in the accumulation of wealth. Since houses in white neighborhoods appreciate faster, even African Americans who are able to overcome their "starting point" are unlikely to accumulate wealth as fast as whites. Shapiro asserts this is a continual cycle from which whites consistently benefit.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas M. |last=Shapiro |title=The Hidden Cost of Being African American; How Wealth Perpetuates Inequality |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-518138-8|date=December 12, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits also have effects on schooling and other life opportunities.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|32–3}}

Royster compared black and white males who graduated from the same school with the same skills.  In looking at their success with school-work transition and working experiences, she found that white graduates were more often employed in skilled trades, earned more, held higher status positions, received more promotions and experienced shorter periods of unemployment. Since all other factors were similar, the differences in employment experiences were attributed to race.  Royster concluded that the primary cause of these racial differences was due to [[social networking]]. The concept of "who you know" seemed just as important to these graduates as "what you know".

According to the distinctiveness theory, posited by [[University of Kentucky]] professor Ajay Mehra and colleagues, people identify with other people who share similar characteristics which are otherwise rare in their environment; women identify more with women, whites with other whites. Because of this, Mehra finds that white males tend to be highly central in their social networks due to their numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Karsten|editor1-first=Margaret Foegen|title=Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in the Workplace: Organizational practices and individual strategies for women and minorities|date=2006|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.

===Housing===
{{further|Racial inequality in the United States#Housing}}
[[Housing discrimination in the United States|Discrimination in housing policies]] was formalized in 1934 under the Federal Housing Act which provided government credit to private lending for home buyers.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|5}}  Within the Act, the Federal Housing Agency had the authority to channel all the money to white home buyers instead of minorities.&lt;ref name=possessive/&gt;{{rp|5}}  The FHA also channeled money away from inner-city neighborhoods after World War II and instead placed it in the hands of white home buyers who would move into segregated suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=Paula S. |last=Rothenberg |year=2005 |title=White Privilege |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=0-7167-8733-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These practices and others, intensified attitudes of segregation and inequality.

The "single greatest source of wealth" for white Americans is the growth in value in their owner-occupied homes. The family wealth so generated is the most important contribution to wealth disparity between black and white Americans.&lt;ref name=possessive&gt;{{cite book|author=George Lipsitz|title=The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit from Identity Politics, Revised and Expanded Edition|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PIqUajTEfk0C|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-59213-495-3|pages=32–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–33}}{{Dubious | Housing | reason = Poorly sourced.

Brown, Carnoey and Oppenheimer, in "Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society," write that the financial inequities created by discriminatory housing practices also have an ongoing effect on young black families, since the net worth of one's parents is the best predictor of one's own net worth, so discriminatory financial policies of the past contribute to race-correlated financial inequities of today.&lt;ref name=whitewashing&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael K.

African Americans are disproportionately sent to [[special education]] classes in their schools, identified as being disruptive or suffering from a learning disability. These students are segregated for the majority of the school day, taught by uncertified teachers, and do not receive high school diplomas. Wanda Blanchett has said that white students have consistently privileged interactions with the special education system, which provides 'non-normal' whites with the resources they need to benefit from the mainline white educational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchett | first1 = Wanda J. | year = 2006| title = Disproportionate Representation of African American Students in Special Education: Acknowledging the Role of White Privilege and Racism | url = http://edr.sagepub.com/content/35/6/24 | journal = Educational Researcher | volume = 35 | issue = 24| page = 2006 | doi = 10.3102/0013189X035006024 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In South Africa==
[[File:Population registration certificate South Africa 1988.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Registration certificate identifies a person as white]]
White privilege was legally enshrined in South Africa through [[apartheid]]. Apartheid was institutionalized in 1948 and lasted formally into the early 1990s. Under apartheid, racial privilege was not only socially meaningful—it became bureaucratically regulated. Laws such as the 1950 [[Population Registration Act, 1950|Population Registration Act]] established criteria to officially classify South Africans by race: White, Indian, Coloured (mixed), or Black.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Posel, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/525576 "Race as Common Sense: Racial Classification in Twentieth-Century South Africa"], ''African Studies Review'' 44 (2), September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars say that 'whiteness' still corresponds to a set of social advantages in South Africa, and conventionally refer to these advantages as "white privilege". The system of white privilege applies both to the way a person is treated by others and to a set of behaviors, affects, and thoughts, which can be learned and reinforced. These elements of "whiteness" establish social status and guarantee advantages for some people, without directly relying on skin color or other aspects of a person's appearance.&lt;ref name=Vice/&gt; White privilege in South Africa has small-scale effects, such as preferential treatment for people who appear white in public, and large-scale effects, such as the over five-fold difference in average per-capita income for people identified as white or black.&lt;ref&gt;Sally Matthews, "[http://mg.co.za/article/2011-09-12-inherited-or-earned-advantage Inherited or earned advantage?]", ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', September 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} claim white people are seen presumptively as "Australian", and as prototypical citizens.&lt;ref name=Lobo/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ganley/&gt; Catherine Koerner has claimed that a major part of white Australian privilege is the ability to be in Australia itself, and that this is reinforced by, discourses on non-white outsiders including [[asylum seekers]] and [[Illegal immigration|undocumented immigrants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koerner | first1 = Catherine | year =  | title = Whose Security?

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} have suggested that public displays of [[multiculturalism]], such as the celebration of artwork and stories of [[Indigenous Australians]], amount to [[tokenism]], since indigenous Australians voices are largely excluded from the cultural [[History wars|discourse]] surrounding the history of colonialism and the narrative of European colonizers as peaceful settlers. These scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} suggest that white privilege in Australia, like white privilege elsewhere, involves the ability to define the limits of what can be included in a "multicultural" society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Larbalestier|first=Jan|title=White Over Black: Discourses of Whiteness in Australian Culture|url=http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol3no2_2004/larbalestier_white.htm|work=Borderlands e-Journal|accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Howard-Wagner, "'[https://tasa.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Howard-Wagner.pdf Practices of Inclusiveness' in Newcastle: protocols of whiteness, Indigenous protocols and power relations]", TASA Conference, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maryrose Casey, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/177CRWS201281Casey.pdf Colonisation, Notions of Authenticity and Aboriginal Australian Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210111/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/177CRWS201281Casey.pdf |date=April 9, 2013 }}", ''Critical Race and Whiteness Studies'' [http://www.acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210015/http://acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 |date=April 9, 2013 }}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous studies in Australian universities remains largely controlled by white people, hires many white professors, and does not always embrace political changes that benefit indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredericks | first1 = Brownwyn | title = The Epistemology That Maintains White Race Privilege, Power and Control of Indigenous Studies and Indigenous Peoples' Participation in Universities | url = http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/45acrawsa518.pdf | journal = ACRAWSA e-journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130410062923/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/45acrawsa518.pdf | archivedate = April 10, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lampert | first1 = Jo | title = The Alabaster Academy: Being a Non-Indigenous Academic in Indigenous Studies | url = http://eprints.qut.edu.au/6253/1/6253.pdf| journal = Social Alternatives | volume = 22 | issue = 3| year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hart2003&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = Victor | title = Teaching Black and Teaching Back | url = http://www.geocities.ws/parentsaspartners/teachingblack.pdf| journal = Social Alternatives | volume = 22 | issue = 3| year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gunstone | first1 = Andrew | title = Whites, Indigenous People, and Australian Universities | url = http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/44acrawsa517.pdf | journal = ACRAWSA e-journal | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | year = 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150228013434/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/44acrawsa517.pdf | archivedate = February 28, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars also say that prevailing modes of Western epistemology and pedagogy, associated with the dominant white culture, are treated as universal while Indigenous perspectives are excluded or treated only as objects of study.&lt;ref name=Hart2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester-Irabinna Rigney, "[https://ncis.anu.edu.au/_lib/doc/LI_Rigney_First_perspective.pdf A first perspective of Indigenous Australian participation in science : framing Indigenous research towards Indigenous Australian intellectual sovereignty]", ''Kaurna Higher Education Journal'' 7, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aileen Moreton-Robinson, "Whiteness, epistemology, and indigenous representation", in ''Whitening Race: Essays In Social And Cultural Criticism'', ed.

Some scholars{{who|date=February 2016}} have claimed that for Australian whites, another aspect of privilege is the ability to identify with a global diaspora of other white people in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. This privilege contrasts with the separation of Indigenous Australians from other indigenous peoples in southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Perera2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holly Randell-Moon, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/editorials/54CRWSRandell-Moon2012.pdf Racial Legitimations and the Unbearable Whiteness of Being] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210109/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/editorials/54CRWSRandell-Moon2012.pdf |date=April 9, 2013 }}", ''Critical Race and Whiteness Studies'' [http://www.acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210015/http://acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=54 |date=April 9, 2013 }}, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that global political issues such as climate change are framed in terms of white actors and effects on countries that are predominantly white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = Lars | title = The whiteness of climate change | url = http://www.ub.edu/dpfilsa/jeasa22jensen9.pdf | journal = Journal of the European Association of Studies on Australia | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | year = 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131103072740/http://www.ub.edu/dpfilsa/jeasa22jensen9.pdf | archivedate = November 3, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

White privilege varies across places and situations. Ray Minniecon, director of Crossroads Aboriginal Ministries, described the city of [[Sydney]] specifically as "the most alien and inhospitable place of all to Aboriginal culture and people."&lt;ref&gt;Ray Minniecon, "[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/02/16/1076779903465.html Despair the reality for a race lost in the alien space of Redfern]", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', February 17, 2004; quoted by Suvendrini Perera, "[http://www.acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/64SuvendriniPerera.pdf 'Aussie Luck': the Border Politics of Citizenship Post Cronulla Beach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410063014/http://acrawsa.org.au/files/ejournalfiles/64SuvendriniPerera.pdf |date=April 10, 2013 }}", ''ACRAWSA e-journal'' [http://www.acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=23 3(1)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409210028/http://acrawsa.org.au/ejournal/?id=23 |date=April 9, 2013 }}, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the spectrum, anti-racist white Australians working with Indigenous people may experience their privilege as painful "stigma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kowal|first=Emma|title=THE STIGMA OF WHITE PRIVILEGE|journal=Cultural Studies|date=May 1, 2011|volume=25|issue=3|pages=313–333|doi=10.1080/09502386.2010.491159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of white privilege in Australia have increased since the late 1990s, with several books published on the history of how whiteness became a dominant identity. Aileen Moreton-Robinson's ''Talkin' Up to the White Woman'' is a critique of unexamined white privilege in the Australian feminist movement.&lt;ref name=Ganley&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ganley | first1 = Toby | title = What's all this talk about whiteness? | url = http://www.polsis.uq.edu.au/dialogue/vol-1-2-4.pdf | journal = Dialogue | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | year = 2003 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130428181555/http://www.polsis.uq.edu.au//dialogue/vol-1-2-4.pdf | archivedate = April 28, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Critical Race and Whiteness Studies Association formed in 2005 to study racial privilege and promote respect for Indigenous sovereignties; it publishes an online journal called ''Critical Race and Whiteness Studies''.&lt;ref&gt;"ACRAWSA: About", ''Australian Critical Race and Whiteness Studies Association'', updated January 30, 2012; accessed November 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
