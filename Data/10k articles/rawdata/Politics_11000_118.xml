[[File:Fonteira PT-LIS PT-OER.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The border between the municipalities of [[Lisbon]] and [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]]; shared also by the civil parishes of [[Santa Maria de Belém]] (Lisbon) and [[Algés Parish|Algés]] (Oeiras)]]

Administratively, [[Portugal]] is ''de jure'' unitary and decentralized state. Nonetheless, operationally, it is highly centralized system with administrative divisions organized into three tiers.&lt;ref name="CNS p5"&gt;Carlos Nuno Silva (2002), p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The State is organized under the principles of subsidiarity, local government autonomy, and democratic decentralization of the public service.&lt;ref name="CNS p5" /&gt;

The government structure is based on the [[Constitution of Portugal|1976 Constitution]], adopted after the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]]. In addition to defining the status of the [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] ({{lang-pt|regiões autónomas}}) [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]] (Articles 225-234), the Constitution specifically identifies the three tiers of government (Article 235-262): [[freguesia (Portugal)|civil parishes]] (''freguesias''), [[Municipalities of Portugal|municipalities]] (''municípios'') and administrative regions ({{lang|pt|regiões administrativas}}).&lt;ref name="Cons05"&gt;{{cite web|title=7th Constitutional Revision |url=http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |accessdate=13 August 2014 |publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]] |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022091934/http://app.parlamento.pt/site_antigo/ingles/cons_leg/Constitution_VII_revisao_definitive.pdf |archivedate=22 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Portuguese territory was redefined during European integration, under a system of statistical regions and subregions known as [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]]. These NUTS definitions, used for collecting statistical information, follow many of the country's border definitions. Although utilized by the Portuguese government, they do not have a legal status in law.

The current administrative divisions of [[Portugal]], are the 18 Districts and the 2 Autonomous Regions.

==Districts==

There are 18 districts in [[mainland Portugal]]:

The distribution of Portuguese districts is nominally homogeneous, although there are outliers (Beja for example is 4.6 times larger than the smallest district, Viana do Castelo).  But these divisions bely the inadequacies and disparities that exist within the country: the distribution of population and gross domestic product between territorial units are markedly different.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt; The district of Beja, for example, represents approximately 11.5% of the area of Portugal, while Viana do Castelo is less than 2.5%. But, in comparison, Beja represents only 1.6% of the population of Portugal.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt;

Portugal is primarily a seafaring nation, and traditionally human settlement has congregated along the coastline, so much so that the coastal districts, while being relatively small, were disproportionately larger by population.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt; The six largest districts (with the exception of Santarém) are the six districts with the smallest populations and common character: a frontier with Spain.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt; Of these interior districts, which represent 63.8% of the nation and have a population that is less than two million residents, is only marginally less than the population of the district of Lisbon.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt;

The district system dates back to 25 April 1835, a creation of the Liberal government, and inspired by the French ''[[départements]]'', with the objective to facilitate the action of government and permit access to the authorities.&lt;ref name=Silveira /&gt;

The district is the most relevant and historically significant subdivision of the nation's territory; it serves as the basis for a series of administrative divisions, such as electoral constituencies or [[Portuguese District Football Associations|district football associations]], as well as being a socially recognizable territorial division of the country.&lt;ref name="SOP" /&gt;
In 1976, Portugal was divided into 18 districts and two [[Autonomous regions of Portugal|autonomous regions]] (the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]]), consisting of 308 municipalities ({{lang|pt|[[concelho]]s}}), which in turn were divided into 4257 local government authorities ({{lang|pt|[[Freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]}}).

Article 291 of the 1976 Constitution defined the districts as a transitional level of administration, awaiting the formation of the administrative regions. In the period between 2003 and 2013 the whole continental territory of Portugal was subdivided into metropolitan areas and intermunicipal communities, which rendered the districts obsolete.{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}} As a consequence of these constitutional revisions the ''"district"'' has been removed from the legal framework, but remains an important and relevant division for other entities.{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}} Similarly, it is still recognized by the general public.

== Autonomous regions ==

{{Main|Autonomous regions of Portugal}}
[[File:Ponta Delgada.jpg|235px|right|thumbnail|Ponta Delgada, one of the three regional capitals of the Autonomous Region of the Azores]]
[[File:Monte - Colégio Infante.jpg|235px|thumbnail|right|Funchal, the regional capital of the Autonomous Region of Madeira]]
Since 1976, Portugal conceded political autonomy to its North Atlantic archipelagos ([[Madeira]] and [[Azores]]) due to their distance, isolation, geographical context and socio-economic circumstances. The regional autonomies have their own organic laws, regional governments and administration, overseen by a Regional Government ({{lang|pt|Governo Regional}}), that constitutes a Regional Cabinet, comprising a President ({{lang|pt|Presidente do Governo Regional}}) and several Regional Secretaries ({{lang|pt|Secretários Regionais}}).

The '''[[Azores]]''' ({{lang|pt|Açores}}) is an archipelago of nine islands and several islets that were discovered and settled by the Portuguese in the late 15th century. The Azores lies a third of the distance between Europe and North America, along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]]. The government and administration of the archipelago is distributed between the three capitals of the former districts of the Azores: the regional parliament is located in the city of [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] (on [[Faial Island]]); [[Ponta Delgada]] (on [[São Miguel Island]]) is the most populous city and home to the Regional Presidency and administration; while [[Angra do Heroísmo]] (on [[Terceira Island]]), the historical and cultural capital, is the home of the Azorean judiciary and seat of the Diocese of the Azores.

'''[[Madeira]]''' is an [[archipelago]] that includes two principal islands, Madeira and [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]], plus two uninhabited natural group of islands, the [[Desertas Islands|Desertas]] and [[Savage Islands]] ({{lang|pt|Ilhas Selvagens}}). The archipelago is located closer to Africa than Europe, is highly commercial and urbanized; its regional capital ([[Funchal]]) is developmentally comparable to urban centers in the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] or [[Balearic Islands]].

== Subdivisions ==
{{Main|Subdivisions of Portugal}}
The division of the Portuguese territory is established in title eight (Título VIII) of the Portuguese constitution: granting local authority to territorial collectivities with representative organs to affect the interests of the local populations.&lt;ref name=Cons05 /&gt; These collectivities are defined as '''autonomous regions''', '''administrative regions''', '''municipalities''' and '''civil parishes''', but reserves the right of urban areas and islands to establish other forms of local authority.&lt;ref name=Cons05 /&gt; In defining the rights and privileges of these entities, the constitution also defines sources of income, that includes local heritage, budgets and equalization transfers from the State, in addition to defining the basic role of local government at each level.&lt;ref name=Cons05 /&gt;

=== Autonomous regions ===
{{Main|Autonomous regions of Portugal}}
Since 1976, Portugal conceded political autonomy to its North Atlantic archipelagos ([[Madeira]] and [[Azores]]) due to their distance, isolation, geographical context and socio-economic circumstances. The regional autonomies have their own organic laws, regional governments and administration, overseen by a Regional Government ({{lang|pt|Governo Regional}}), that constitutes a Regional Cabinet, comprising a President ({{lang|pt|Presidente do Governo Regional}}) and several Regional Secretaries ({{lang|pt|Secretários Regionais}}).

=== Administrative regions ===

A plan to divide mainland Portugal in eight regions was defeated in a [[Portuguese regionalisation referendum, 1998|referendum in 1998]].&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt; The metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto were created in 1991.&lt;ref name=oliveira&gt;Fernanda Paula Oliveira (2009), {{PDFWayback|url=http://www.cityfutures2009.com/PDF/96_Oliveira_Fernanda_Paula.pdf|title=The Evolution and Regulation of the Metropolitan Areas in Portugal|date=20130204143458|size=677 kB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law passed in 2003 supported the creation of more metropolitan areas, urban communities and other associations of municipalities,&lt;ref name=law10&gt;{{cite web|title=Law nr. 10/2003|url=http://www.dre.pt/util/getpdf.asp?s=dip&amp;serie=1&amp;iddr=2003.110A&amp;iddip=20031317 |accessdate=13 August 2014|work=[[Diário da República]]|publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a law passed in 2008 abolished these, converting them into [[Intermunicipal communities of Portugal|intermunicipal communities]].&lt;ref name=law45&gt;{{cite web|title=Law nr. 45/2008|url=http://www.dre.pt/util/getpdf.asp?s=dip&amp;serie=1&amp;iddr=2008.165&amp;iddip=20082445 |accessdate=13 August 2014|work=[[Diário da República]]|publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oliveira /&gt; Finally in law 75/2013 of September 2013 the current two types of administrative regions were defined:&lt;ref name=law75&gt;{{cite web|title=Law nr. 75/2013|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1s/2013/09/17600/0568805724.pdf |accessdate=13 August 2014|work=[[Diário da República]]|publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Metropolitan areas in Portugal}}
The [[Metropolitan areas in Portugal|Metropolitan Areas]] are territorial units formed by grouping municipalities, in order to economize on municipal investments and services. As of 2014, there are two metropolitan areas that correspond to Level III NUTS regions:&lt;ref name=law75 /&gt;
* The [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]] (''Área Metropolitana de Lisboa''), consisting of 18 municipalities with a total population (2011 census) of 2,821,876
* The [[Metropolitan Area of Porto]] (''Área Metropolitana do Porto''), consisting of 17 municipalities with a total population (2011 census) of 1,759,524

==== Intermunicipal communities ====
{{Main|Intermunicipal communities of Portugal}}

The intermunicipal communities replaced the urban communities, the intermunicipal communities for general purposes and some [[Metropolitan areas in Portugal|metropolitan areas]] that were created in 2003,&lt;ref name=oliveira /&gt;&lt;ref name=law10 /&gt;&lt;ref name=law11&gt;{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11/2003|url=http://www.dre.pt/util/getpdf.asp?s=dip&amp;serie=1&amp;iddr=2003.110A&amp;iddip=20031318 |accessdate=13 August 2014|work=[[Diário da República]]|publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abolished in 2008.&lt;ref name=law45 /&gt;&lt;ref name=oliveira /&gt; The territories of the intermunicipal communities are (roughly) based on the [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS III]] statistical regions.

=== Municipalities ===
{{Main|Municipalities of Portugal|List of municipalities of Portugal}}
[[File:Coimbra Portugal.jpg|235px|right|thumb|View of Coimbra, one of the two oldest municipalities in Portugal.]]

Apart from the national territory, that includes mainland Portugal and the two archipelagos, the municipalities (''municípios'', colloquially known as ''concelhos'') have been the most constant territorial subdivision in the past 900 years.&lt;ref name=Silveira /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOP" /&gt;  While a term for ''municipality'' ({{lang|pt|concelho}}) appeared in the 13th century, to ''"express a community constituted in a territory of varying extensions, whose residents&amp;nbsp;– the neighbours of the municipality&amp;nbsp;– are granted major or minor administrative autonomy"'', the territorial division predates its use.&lt;ref name=ferreira&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hdl.handle.net/10216/19439|first=José António Costa|last=Ferreira|year=2005|title=O Poder Local e Regional na Assembleia Constituinte de 1975/76: As Regiões Adminsitrativas|publisher=Faculdade de Letras, Universidade do Porto|location=Porto, Portugal|language=Portuguese|pages=20–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preceding the nation's independence, the oldest of the larger municipalities still in existence [[Coimbra]] and [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] were founded in 1085 e 1095, respectively. [[São João da Pesqueira Municipality, Portugal|São João da Pesqueira]] (in the district of [[Viseu]]) is the oldest Portuguese municipality, founded in 1055.

Since the creation of a democratic local administration, in 1976, the Portuguese municipalities have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body (the [[Câmara Municipal|municipal chamber]]) and a deliberative body (the [[Assembleia Municipal|municipal assembly]]). The municipal chamber ({{lang|pt|câmara municipal}}) is the executive body, and is composed of a ''president'' of the municipality and a number of councillors whose number depends on the municipality's population. The [[Assembleia Municipal|municipal assembly]] ({{lang|pt|assembleia municipal}}) is composed of the presidents of all the civil parishes plus a number of directly elected representatives that has to be at least equal to the number of civil parish presidents plus one, and which otherwise depends on the municipal population.&lt;ref name="Cons05" /&gt;

There are 308 municipalities in Portugal. They are usually named for their biggest city, or at least, their historically most important city or town. However, the municipality is usually much larger than the city or town after which it is named. The largest in area is [[Odemira]] with 1720.60&amp;nbsp;km², the smallest is [[São João da Madeira]] with an area of 7.94&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=dgt&gt;[http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ Áreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e país]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all municipalities are subdivided into [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parishes]]. [[Barcelos, Portugal|Barcelos]] is the municipality with the largest number of civil parishes (61).&lt;ref name=law75 /&gt; There are six municipalities that have only one civil parish: [[São João da Madeira]], [[Alpiarça]], [[Barrancos]], [[Castanheira de Pera]], [[Porto Santo]] (Madeira) and [[São Brás de Alportel]].&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt;&lt;ref name=law75 /&gt; The municipality of [[Vila do Corvo|Corvo]] (comprising the [[Corvo Island]] in the Azores) is the only Portuguese municipality without a civil parish.&lt;ref name="SOP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alra.pt/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11&amp;Itemid=125|title=Political and Administrative Statute of the Autonomous Region of the Azores|publisher=|date=12 January 2009}}, Article 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil parishes ===
{{Main|Freguesia (Portugal)|List of parishes of Portugal}}
The parish, in contrast with the municipalities, had their base in the ecclesiastical divisions that ''"had its origin in the fact that neighbours professed the same religion and professed their faith and divinity in the same temple"''.&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt;  Between 1216 and 1223, [[Afonso II of Portugal]] began a process of legitimizing the Portuguese territory by conferring charters to nobles, clergy and municipal chambers (which would not be completed until after 1249 (under [[Afonso III of Portugal]]), making the parish the smallest division. From the 19th century ''freguesia'' began to refer to the civil/administrative entity, while the ''paróquia'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] and 19th-century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''parochia'') became affiliated with the religious entity.

Since the creation of a democratic local administration, in 1976, the Portuguese parishes have been ruled by a system composed by an executive body (the ''[[junta de freguesia]]'', "parish board") and a deliberative body (the ''[[assembleia de freguesia]]'', "parish assembly"). The members of the ''assembleia de freguesia'' are publicly elected every four years. The presidents of the parish boards are also members of the [[Assembleia Municipal|municipal assembly]].&lt;ref name="Cons05" /&gt;

Before the 2013 local government reforms, the 308 municipalities were subdivided into 4,259 civil parishes.&lt;ref name=greendoc&gt;{{cite web|title=Documento Verde da Reforma da Administração Local|editor=Gabinete do Ministro Adjunto e dos Assuntos Parlamentares |publisher=Governo da República |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |year=2011 |accessdate=13 August 2014 |url=http://www.portugal.gov.pt/media/132774/doc_verde_ref_adm_local.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the national government's attempt to control spending, in light of the [[sovereign debt crisis]], in 2012 the government of [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] introduced a plan to reform the administrative divisions, in order to create efficiencies and save money. The plan envisioned the reform of the management, territorial geography and political form of how Portugal functioned at the local level, including specifically at the ''freguesia'' and ''município'' levels.&lt;ref name=greendoc /&gt; In addition to the reduction of the number of representatives in the local boards, the plan also established criteria for the reduction, amalgamation or extinction of various civil parishes.&lt;ref name=greendoc /&gt; The reform was implemented according to law 11-A/2013 of January 2013, which defined the reorganization of the civil parishes,&lt;ref name=law11A&gt;{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=13 August 2014|work=[[Diário da República]]|publisher=[[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)]]|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2013 reform, there are 3,091 parishes in Portugal. The largest in area is [[Alcácer do Sal|Alcácer do Sal (Santa Maria do Castelo e Santiago) e Santa Susana]] with 888.35&amp;nbsp;km², the smallest is [[Borba, Portugal|Borba (São Bartolomeu)]] with an area of 0.20&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name=dgt /&gt;

== Historical subdivisions ==
[[File:antigas Provincias Portugal.png|thumb|150px|Historical division of Portugal into six provinces (14th to 19th centuries).]]
Portugal has a complex administrative structure, a consequence of a millennium of various territorial divisions. Unlike other European countries like Spain or France, the Portuguese territory was settled early, and maintained with stability after the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Silveira"&gt;{{cite web|first=Luís|last=Silveira|title=Origins and Evolution of the Portuguese Administrative System in Comparative Perspective|url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/hist-bound/papers/portugese_admin_system.htm|publisher=Universidade Nova de Lisboa|date=May 2000|location=Lisbon, Portugal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first division of the Portuguese territory was based exclusively on the Roman Iberian provinces of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], [[Lusitania]] and [[Hispania Baetica]], established by Emperor Augustus between 27-13 B.C.&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt; The actual territory of Portugal north of the Douro, the Province of Tarraconensis, occupied half of the peninsula, while the Province Lusitania, included the area south of the Douro. These Roman provinces were themselves subdivided into ''[[conventus iuridicus]]'': ''Conventus Bracarum'', its seat in ''Bracara Augusta'' (today the city of Braga); ''Conventus Scallabitanus'', its seat in ''Scallabis'' (today the city of Santarém); and ''Conventus Pacensis'', its seat in ''Pax Julia'' (today Beja).&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt; By the end of the third century, Emperor Diocleatian administratively reordered Tarraconesis, dividing it into three separate territories (Tarraconensis, Carthaginensis and Callaecia), the latter comprising the northern Portugal, Galizia and Austurias.&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt; These divisions remained constant even after the Visigoths controlled the Iberian peninsula.

During the period of [[Al-Andalus]] and Muslim caliphates, the Iberian peninsula was divided administratively into provinces (''kuwar'') and municipalities (''kurar''), along the lines of the Roman-Visigothic delineations.&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt; Meanwhile, the ''taifa'' of Badajoz dominated the spaces of Beiras, Estremadura and a great part of the Alentejo.&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt;

With the expansion of the Portuguese national territory, following the [[Reconquista|conquest]] of new lands, the monarchy imposed a structure that permitted permanent dominion and organization of territorial space.&lt;ref name=Silveira /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOP"&gt;Manuel Lima (2005),{{cite web|url=http://www.shapesofportugal.com/sop/divisoes/ |title=Divisões Administrativas de Portugal: Um olhar pela diversidade da divisão territorial portuguesa |accessdate=2011-03-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305072934/http://www.shapesofportugal.com/sop/divisoes/ |archivedate=2011-03-05 |df= }}  {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a tendency to demarcate lands associated with settlements or seigneurial properties; there was a constant history of [[foral]]s (the royal charters) being allocated for unorganized territories, as a means to primarily establish fielty rights and encourage medieval settlement.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt;&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt; Historically, the institution of the [[foral]] system was a way to divide the territory and to establish local administrative control (and not regional or hierarchical continuity).&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuno Valério 2001, p.27"&gt;Nuno Valério (2001), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the parish, instituted by the religious orders that dominated the country, controlled local ecclesiastical power at the local level.

During the reign of King Dinis (1279–1325), the monarch instituted a series of inquiries throughout the kingdom which resulted, a few years later, in the configuration of the territory into provinces and municipalities.&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt; This was the first official recognition of the diversity of the country, and in the King's ''Testamento do Reino de Portugal'' he recognized the five '''"regions"''' of the nation: ''Antre Douro e Minho''; ''Antre Douro e Mondego''; ''Beira'', ''Estremadura'' and ''Antre Tejo e Odiana''.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt;&lt;ref name="SOP1b"&gt;DGOTGU (2007), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Provinces ===
{{Main|Provinces of Portugal}}
[[File:Provincias Portugal legenda.png|thumb|150px|1936 provinces of Continental Portugal]]
Dinis's successor, [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] (1325–1357), instituted a system of six official [[comarcas]], that reflected a concrete definition of these regions: ''Antre Douro e Minho'', ''Antre Douro e Mondego'', ''Beira'', ''Estremadura'', ''Antre Tejo e Odiana'' and ''Algarve''.&lt;ref name=SOP /&gt;&lt;ref name=ferreira /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nuno Valério 2001, p.27" /&gt; Between the reign of Afonso IV and the 20th century there were numerous alterations to the limits of the nation, a consequence of development and population growth. Further modifications to the limits of these provinces occurred in the ''Plano de Ordenamento da Mata Nacional da Machada'' (1864), the first scientific delimiting of forest resources, and the ''Projecto Geral da Arborização dos Areais Móveis de Portugal'' (1897), which modified land usage along the coast.&lt;ref name=SOP1b /&gt;

But, until 1832, the provinces did not serve an administrative function, although they did mark the differences in habits, linguistic peculiarities and socio-cultural characteristics.  The province remained a military designation, chiefed by the ''General das Armas'' (Military Governor), expressly forbidden from influencing municipal affairs. During the Liberal regime, some of the liberal politicians conceived an administrative system where provinces were the top level tier of government, maintaining their former names, but with different frontiers.&lt;ref name=Silveira /&gt; The debate over the importance of provinces only arose from fears that there would be an excessive concentration of power in the hands of governmental officers ({{lang|pt|prefeitos}}). The adoption of the 17 districts (1835) instead of eight provinces was an attempt to dissolve such power.

In 1936, the provinces were reestablished as administrative divisions in Portugal. However, instead the six traditional provinces, 11 new ones were established: ''Minho'', ''Douro Litoral'', ''Trás-os-Montes e Alto Douro'', ''Beira Alta'', ''Beira Baixa'', ''Beira Litoral'', ''Estremadura'', ''Ribatejo'', ''Alto Alentejo'', ''Baixo Alentejo'' and ''Algarve''. These were based in the natural regions identified by the geographer Amorim Girão in several studies he published between 1922 and 1930. The [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime used the provinces to characterize traditional and rural Portugal. Each province intended to be a regional community, to which were given [[Decentralization|decentralized powers]].&lt;ref name="AtlasPoeira"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lourdes|last=Poeira|title=Políticas da Território: A administração|trans-title=Territorial Politics: The Administration|language=Portuguese|location=Lisbom, Portugal|publisher=IGP Instituto Geográfico Português|url=http://www.igeo.pt/atlas/Cap3/Cap3f_1.html|year=2011|accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the Districts continued to define administrative and political control, much like the organization of public security for the State, limiting the powers of local government.&lt;ref name=AtlasPoeira /&gt; This organizational structure for the territory resulted in a loss of the sense of regional identity, which was only kept alive by oral traditions, based on regional references of origin.&lt;ref name=AtlasPoeira /&gt;

There was a substantial difference between the European provinces and regions and the overseas colonies (the so-called ''overseas provinces'').

Following the [[Carnation Revolution]], the regions and provinces were abolished and the districts became the second level administrative regions.

==== Overseas ====
{{Main|Portuguese Empire}}
The term ''overseas province'' started to be used to designate each of the Portuguese overseas territories, instead of the previous ''overseas dominion'', during the administrative reforms of the beginning of the 19th century, following the idea that these territories were as part of Portugal as the Portuguese European provinces. In the beginning of the 20th century, most of these territories started to be referred as ''colonies'', although the term ''overseas provinces'' continued also to be used. Only after 1951, the term ''colony'' was completely dropped and the term ''overseas province'' was exalted by the government of [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] to shift the attention of anti-colonial protests in the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J. Bender (1978), p.xx&lt;/ref&gt; But the history of extra-local territories (colonies or provinces) within Portuguese administration dates back to the first settlements along the African coast, South-east Asia and Brazil, and were instituted as part of the 1832 reforms. The initiatives envisioned a comprehensive series of provinces that would have included European Portugal, archipelagos and extra-local dependencies in Southeast Asia, Africa and India. These colonies included:&lt;ref&gt;Nuno Valério (2001), p.14-23&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Portuguese West Africa]]&amp;nbsp; an overseas province between 1951 and 1975, when it became the independent nation of [[Angola]];
* [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]]&amp;nbsp;– an overseas province between 1951 and 1974, [[autonomous republic]] between 1974 and 1975, when it became an independent nation;
* [[Portuguese Guinea]]&amp;nbsp; an overseas province between 1951–1974, until unilaterally declaring independence as [[Guinea-Bissau]] in 1973 (later recognised by Portugal in 1974);
* [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]]&amp;nbsp; overseas province between 1844 and 1883; included many of the overseas provinces of South-east Asia with Portuguese Timor in the administration of [[Goa]], between 1883 and 1951); an overseas province between 1951 and 1975; special territory between 1975 and 1999, before being returned to China as a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|special administrative region]] in 1999;
* [[Portuguese East Africa]]&amp;nbsp; overseas province between 1951 and 1974); local administration between 1974 and 1975, before it became the independent nation of [[Mozambique]];
* [[Portuguese India]]&amp;nbsp; an overseas province between 1946 and 1962, it was annexed by India in 1962 (and later recognised by Portugal in 1974);
* [[Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe|São Tomé and Príncipe]]&amp;nbsp; an overseas province between 1951 and 1971); local administration between 1971 and 1975, before it became an independent nation in 1975;
* [[Portuguese Timor]]&amp;nbsp; an overseas territory between 1951 and 1961, until unilaterally declaring independence as [[East Timor]] in 1975, it was annexed by [[Indonesia]] in 1976, recognised by [[United Nations|UN]] as non-self-governing-territory under Portuguese administration between 1961–1999. After 1999 it was a United Nations protectorate until formal independence in 2002.
Initially the population of these overseas territories were made to exploit resources (minerals, spices, wood or slaves), but later there was a sense of evangelisation or ''lusotropolicalism'', that facilitated the colonization of these lands.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald J. Bender (1978), p.2-18&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant colony was [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] whose history included a period as kingdom within the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves]] (1815–1822), before a political schism would result in its independence in 1822.

== NUTS ==
{{Main|NUTS of Portugal}}
[[File:Portugal regions travel map EN.png|thumb|220px|right|Territorial map corresponding to the NUTS I and NUTS II designations]]
The [[Eurostat]]-based NUTS system subdivides the nation into three levels: NUTS I, NUTS II and NUTS III. In some European partners, as is the case with Portugal, a complimentary hierarchy, respectively LAU I and LAU II (posteriorly referred to as NUTS IV and NUTS V) is employed. The LAU, or ''Local Administrative Units'', in the Portuguese context pertains to the 308 municipalities (LAU I) and 4257 civil parishes (LAU II) respectively. In the broadest sense, the NUTS hierarchy, while they may follow some of the  borders (municipal or parish) diverge in their delineation.

'''Animal Justice Party''' ('''AJP''') is a political party in Australia representing an [[animal rights]] perspective in the Australian political arena. On 3 May 2011, the Animal Justice Party was approved by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) and AJP was federally registered as a political party under the [[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]], making the party eligible for federal funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/capital-circle/questions-for-pakistan-as-bin-laden-raid-details-emerge/story-fn59nqgy-1226049538121 |title=Questions for Pakistan as Bin Laden raid details emerge |author=Massola, James |work=[[The Australian]] |date=4 May 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/party_registration/Registration_Decisions/4032.htm |title=Application for party registration approved – Animal Justice Party |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AJP is the first political party in Australia formed to advance animal rights issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalsaustralia.org/features/animal-justice-party.php |title=A New Political Party FOR the Animals! |publisher=Animals Australia |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The [[preamble]] of the AJP [[charter]] says the party "has been formed as a response to growing public concern about the neglect of animals and animal protection issues by political parties" and states its mission is "to promote and protect the interests and capabilities of animals by providing a dedicated voice for them in [[Politics of Australia|Australia's political system]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://animaljusticeparty.org/about/charter/&lt;/ref&gt; The party aims to give animals [[Constitution of Australia|constitutional]] protection based on their [[Animal rights#Tom Regan: Subjects-of-a-life|sentience]], as opposed to their instrumental value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animaljusticeparty.org/constitution/ |title=Animal Justice Party Our Charter |publisher=Animal Justice Party |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sole purpose of the AJP is to provide a focal point for people who feel there is a lack of action taken by political figures that concerns the wellbeing of animals.

== The AJP position ==
The AJP is highly against the export of any live animals for profit, especially slaughter. They want an international ban of all live animal hauling throughout the world. "We demand an end to the export of live animals from Australia at the earliest possible time, taking into consideration any domestic welfare issues exceeding those faced overseas, that the animals previously earmarked for live export would suffer in the event of a ban" says Steve Garlick, previous president of AJP. The group realises that their government will not put a ban on the live animal export because it brings in so much money for the country even though countless instances of cruelty have been blatantly proven. The exported animals usually go to countries that have no animal welfare laws or protection codes that ensure their protection and well being.

==History==
In 2011, in the light of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s television footage showing [[Animal abuse|abuse]] and the slaughter of cattle from the [[Northern Territory]] in conditions that would not have been permitted in Australia, as well as the consequential nationwide protests by supporters of [[animal welfare]],&lt;ref name="Aussies march"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/5163119/Aussies-march-to-end-live-cattle-exports/ |title=Aussies march to end live cattle exports |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AJP, along with [[Animals Australia]], the [[Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union]] (AMIEU), [[Australian Greens|The Greens]] and a range of other NGOs sought a ban on live animal exports. Steve Garlick, president of the Animal Justice Party, said that rural Australia has been adversely affected by the export of live animals and argued that the export ban would result in economic and social benefit in the country.&lt;ref name="Aussies march"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-06-03/animal-lobby-and-meatworkers-united-against-live/2744170 |title=Animal lobby and meatworkers united against live exports |author=Jeanes, Tim |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], the party was criticised for preferencing the Liberal Party ahead of the Greens in the ACT Senate. They did this because the Greens had supported the culling of kangaroos in the ACT. This preferencing decision had no impact on the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/ill-say-sorry-to-jakarta-for-cattle-ban-tony-abbott/story-fn59niix-1226639332349 | work=The Australian | title=I'll say sorry to Jakarta for cattle ban: Tony Abbott | date=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was a member of [[Glenn Druery]]'s [[Minor Party Alliance]] but failed to win a seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/bitter-dispute-erupts-over-senate-preferences-in-queensland/4939300 Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland: ABC 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/alliance-of-micro-parties-boosts-odds-for-likes-of-one-nation-or-shooters-and-fishers-gaining-senate-spot-through-preferences/story-fnho52jp-1226713114765 Alliance of micro parties boosts odds for likes of One Nation or Shooters and Fishers gaining Senate spot through preferences: Daily Telegraph 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The AJP recorded a 0.70 percent national Senate vote.&lt;ref name=AEC&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/ Past elections: AEC]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5207">The '''Bangkok Rules''', also known as "[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/BangkokRules.pdf The United Nations Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders]", is a set of rules focused on the needs of women offenders and prisoners adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in December 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duihua.org/wp/?p=1205|title=Bangkok Rules Address the Plight of Women in Prison|publisher=Dui Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangkok Rules is the first set of rules geared towards the treatment of [[women prisoners]]. It supplements the existing international standards on the treatment of prisoners, particularly the [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]], which applies to all prisoners regardless of gender.

== Introduction ==

“In 2009, the Thai government submitted a resolution to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council, that recognized the vulnerability of women incarcerated in a system built principally for men. The resolution set in motion a series of meetings that culminated in the UN General Assembly’s December 2010 adoption of the body’s first set of rules focused on women prisoners: Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders, or the Bangkok Rules.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duihua.org/wp/?p=1205|title=Bangkok Rules Address the Plight of Women in Prison|publisher=Dui Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2011, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed a resolution to adopt the Bangkok Rules, which encourage member states "to adopt legislation to establish alternatives to [[imprisonment]] and to give priority to the financing of such systems, as well as to the development of the mechanisms needed for their implementation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CCPCJ/Crime_Resolutions/2010-2019/2010/General_Assembly/A-RES-65-229.pdf|title=Resolution adopted by the General Assembly|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, prisons and prison regimes have almost invariably been designed for the majority male prison population – from the architecture of prisons, to security procedures, to healthcare, family contact, work and training. The 70 Rules give guidance to policy makers, legislators, sentencing authorities and [[prison staff]] to reduce the imprisonment of women, and to meet the specific needs of women in case of imprisonment. The Rules cover a variety of issues, including admission procedures, healthcare, humane treatment, search procedures, children who accompany their mothers into prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penalreform.org/priorities/women-in-the-criminal-justice-system/bangkok-rules-2/|title=UN Bangkok Rules|publisher=Penal Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growing female prison population ==

Estimated to account for between 2 and 10 percent of national prison populations, women are the fastest growing prisoner demographic. In the US, for example, the number of incarcerated women has grown at roughly twice the rate for men, multiplying by almost a factor of seven in the last three decades. Chinese data is not up to date, but, between 1997 and 2002, the number of women in [[Chinese prisons]] increased at an average annual rate of 13 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duihua.org/wp/?p=1205|title=
Bangkok Rules Address the Plight of Women in Prison|publisher=Dui Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duihuahrjournal.org/2015/06/china-women-prisoner-numbers-rise-10.html|title=China: Women Prisoner Numbers Rise 10 Times Faster than Men|publisher=Dui Hua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Victims of Domestic Abuse and Alternatives to Prison ==

Women offenders are disproportionately likely to have been victims of domestic or sexual abuse. Throughout the criminal justice process, they are at risk of further abuse, violence and humiliation – from police, prison officers and fellow prisoners. For many women, custody means ill-treatment, threats of rape, touching, ‘virginity testing’, being stripped naked, invasive body searches, insults and humiliations of a sexual nature or even [[rape]]. There are also cases of women prisoners being forced into a position of providing sex for favours or preferential treatment.  Alternatives to imprisonment – such as community service – have been shown to be much more effective in reducing re-offending and in promoting lasting rehabilitation. However, in many countries alternatives to prison fail to take into account the specific requirements of women offenders. Their caretaking responsibilities and their previous history of domestic violence are often overlooked, as are gender differences in drug dependency and therefore drug treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penalreform.org/priorities/women-in-the-criminal-justice-system/issue/|title=Women in the Criminal Justice System|publisher=Penal Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[orthography]] of the [[Belarusian language]] was reformed in 1933 under [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule]].

==Differences between the old and the new orthography==
# The [[soft sign]] is no longer written when denoting assimilation of 'softness': песня, свет, instead of песьня, сьвет.
# The soft sign is no longer written between double [[consonant]]s: каханне, instead of каханьне.
# The [[grammatical particle|Particle]] не and the [[preposition]] без are written unchanged, independently of [[pronunciation]]: не быў, instead of ня быў; and без мамы, instead of бяз мамы (compare with English [[the|definite article "the"]]).
# [[Loanword]] orthography is regulated:
#* [[Akanye]] is preserved in all cases except ten words (such as рэволюцыя, совет)
#* Central-European l is transmitted as hard and not soft, as in Russian
#* The variants of writing the sound ф with letters п, хв, х, т are removed
#* The endings -тар, -дар are replaced with –тр, -др, for example: літр, instead of літар
#* The endings -ый, -iй are used where appropriate, for example: алюміній instead of алюміні.
# The orthography of [[personal name]]s is regulated so that [[vernacular]] forms are replaced with canonical [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] forms, for example: Юрый instead of Юрка, Юры, Юра or Юрась.
# In [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], the ending -а/-у denoting [[genitive case]] is regulated as -а, as in Russian, and not as -у, as in certain modern dialects. Also unified is the spelling of names in [[dative case|dative]] and [[prepositional case]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4040">A '''bio-energy village''' is a regionally oriented concept for the use of [[renewable energy]] sources in [[rural area]]s. The system uses [[biomass]] from local [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] in a [[biogas powerplant]] to meet the complete energy requirements of a village, such as electricity and [[district heating]].

These villages tend to be self-powered and independent from external [[Electrical grid|grids]], despite being connected to overland grids for feeding surplus energy. The term "bio-energy village" refers to a dependency on fresh biological material as a source of energy only whereas an "[[ecovillage]]" includes a variety of networks.

Examples of such villages are Jühnde near [[Göttingen]], Mauenheim near [[Tuttlingen]] and [[Bollewick]] near Berlin in [[Germany]].

==Energy production==
Liquid manure, grass, silage and other raw materials from agriculture are fermented in a biological gas facility. The [[biogas]] produced fuels a [[Cogeneration|combined heat and power]] plant (CHP). The heat is distributed via a district heating system while power is fed into a local electricity grid. In winter, additional heat requirements can be supplied by a supplementary heating plant, in which wood chips or straw are burned.

==Existing projects==

===Jühnde===
The first bio-energy village in Germany is Jühnde in the district of Göttingen. A project initiated by the Interdisciplinary Centre For Sustainable Development (IZNE) at the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]], and completed in January 2006, the project supplies the village with the heat that it requires and produces twice as much electricity as is used. It has been estimated that the participating households save €750 per year in energy costs.

===Mauenheim===
In Mauenheim, [[Baden-Württemberg]], a bio-energy village has been developed in Immendingen in the district of Tuttlingen, with approximately 400 inhabitants and 148 buildings. The biogas facility and wood chip heating system are supplemented by a [[solar energy]] system. The project started operation in 2006. It has been calculated that about 1900 tonnes of [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] per year will be saved.

===Rai Breitenbach===
The [[Breuberg]]er village of Rai Breitenbach in the [[Odenwald]] (approximately 890 inhabitants) is in the process of becoming a bio-energy village. At present the project is still in the planning stage. A feasibility study has been completed and a co-operative created to carry out the project, which is expected to be completed in 2008.

=== Freiamt ===
The village [[Freiamt]] in the [[Black Forest]] with 4300 inhabitants is using all forms of renewable energy. A biogas plant, Solar power, wind and water energy produce about 14 million kwh energy annually, about 3 million more than needed. Around 150 solar collectors are used for water heating.

==Considerations==

===Advantages===
* No climatically harmful waste gases are released. The risks and waste disposal problem of nuclear energy are avoided.
* The energy produced is often cheaper for consumers than conventional energy.
* Local resources are used, saving transportation energy costs.
* Energy costs are locally spent, strengthening the local economy and creating jobs.

===Disadvantages===
* Capital outlays are high (see also [[Crowdfunding]]..
* The system works only if a large majority of the inhabitants participate, and can be attached to the local heating supply network.
* The gas evolving is not constant in amount, it may differ due to insufficient raw materials.

'''Block FACT''' ({{lang-ru|Блок «Фаланга антикоммунистического тарана»|lit=Block "Phalanx of Anti-Communist Ram"}}) is part of a Russian [[far-right]] group, operating in [[St. Petersburg]] and established in the autumn of 2010.

==Publicity==
The public statements from Block FACT often represent hard [[anti-communism]]. The organization's criteria for labeling a group as [[Communism|communist]] are quite broad. For example, the regimes of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Bashar Assad]], and even the [[Kingdom of Bahrain]] were labeled as "communist" by Block FACT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brus.livejournal.com/98450.html Призраку коммунизма опять накостыляли] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130626191351/http://brus.livejournal.com/98450.html |date=2013-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Block FACT claimed responsibility for the beating of St. Petersburg [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Igor Pykhalov|ru|3=Пыхалов, Игорь Васильевич}}, setting fire to a [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] car (September 2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cprfspb.ru/7437.html Сегодня ночью подожгли автомобиль городского комитета КПРФ], burning down the official St. Petersburg`s branch site of the Russian Federation Communist Party, 11.09.2011&lt;/ref&gt; and assaulting [[magistrate]] Alexei Kuznetsov (April 2013).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novayagazeta.spb.ru/2013/27/3 Самосуд над судьей] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215535/http://www.novayagazeta.spb.ru/2013/27/3 |date=October 4, 2013 }}, Novaya gazeta, 14.04.2013&lt;/ref&gt; Block FACT claimed responsibility for beating Communist Party secretary Alexey Rusakov (August 2012),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krasnoetv.ru/node/15473 О нападении на секретаря ленинградского обкома РКРП-КПСС Алексея Русакова], Krasnoye TV, 09.08.2012&lt;/ref&gt; burning a Communist Party car (February 2012),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cprfspb.ru/8143.html Коммунистов не запугать], the official site of St. Petersburg`s branch of the [[Russian Federation Communist Party]], 09.02.2012&lt;/ref&gt; desecrating and destroying a series of Soviet memorials (plaques Lenin, Uritsky, Romanov, Trefolev, Voytik), and attacking several activists of Communist organizations.&lt;ref name="Godovikov"/&gt;

Some commentators characterized the actions of Block FACT as a relaxed variant of European [[neo-fascist]] terrorism of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgpalata.ru/reaction/0050 Кулак белой ленты], Website of the Perm Civic Chamber, июнь 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It is assumed that the activists of Block FACT attacked a former Duma deputy, [[Viktor Tyulkin]]. The leader of the St. Petersburg communist organizations, Tyulkin, was beaten on 4 October 2013, after a communist demonstration commemorating the 20th anniversary of the events of [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|October 1993]]. One of the attackers congratulated Tyulkin with "happy holidays".&lt;ref&gt;[http://sanktpeterburg.bezformata.ru/listnews/front-mog-napast-blok/14591870/ На лидера партии «Рот Фронт» мог напасть «Блок ФАКТ»], Без формата.RU, 07.10.2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bryant G. Wood''' is a [[Biblical archaeology|biblical archaeologist]] and [[young earth creationist]]. He is Research Director of Associates for Biblical Research&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblearchaeology.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt; and editor of their quarterly archaeology magazine ''Bible and Spade'', which is explicitly committed to the use of [[archaeology]] to demonstrate the [[Biblical inerrancy|historical veracity]] of the [[Old Testament|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bible and Spade Magazine |url=http://www.biblearchaeology.org/publications/bibleandspade.aspx |work=www.biblearchaeology.org |publisher=Associates for Biblical Research |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood is known for his 1990 proposed redating of the [[Battle_of_Jericho#Origins_and_historicity|destruction of Jericho]] to accord with the biblical chronology of c. 1400 BC. His proposal contradicts the dating of c. 1550 BC, as proposed by [[Kathleen Kenyon]] and confirmed by [[carbon-dating]].

== Life and career ==
Wood attended [[Syracuse University]], graduating with a B.S. in mechanical engineering, later earning a M.S. in mechanical engineering from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Troy, New York]]. He later pursued biblical and archaeological studies and received an M.A. in Biblical History from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1974 and a Ph.D. in Syro-Palestinian archaeology from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1985. Wood is a specialist in Canaanite pottery of the [[Late Bronze Age]]. He is author of ''The Sociology of Pottery in Ancient Palestine: The Ceramic Industry and the Diffusion of Ceramic Style in the Bronze and Iron Ages'' (1990), as well as numerous articles on archaeological subjects. In addition, Wood serves as editor of the quarterly publication ''[[Bible and Spade]]''.

Wood received international attention for his proposed redating of ancient [[Jericho]], arguing for the historicity of the biblical account of the capture of the city by the Israelites. He has also written on the entry of the [[Philistines]] into [[Canaan]] and on the historicity of the Biblical story of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]].

Wood is a [[young earth creationist]] who is described by [[Creation Ministries International]] as a creationist archaeologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creation scientists and other specialists of interest |url=http://creation.com/creation-scientists|publisher=Creation Ministries International|accessdate=10 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jericho ==

{{BLP sources|date=November 2015}}
According to the story in the biblical [[book of Joshua]], Jericho was the first [[Canaan]]ite city to fall to the [[Israelites]] as they began their conquest of the Promised Land - an event which the Bible's internal chronology places at around 1406 BC, based on the early 15th century BC exodus-conquest model. This is based on {{bibleverse|1|Kings|6:1|HE}}. During a series of excavations from 1930 to 1936 [[John Garstang]] found a destruction layer at Jericho corresponding to the termination of City IV which he identified with the biblical story of Joshua and dated to c. 1400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Leon James and David O'Brien, ''A Survey of Israel's History'', Zonderfan 1986, {{ISBN|978-0-310-34770-5}} p. 74 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CrBerP0thW8C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=%22John+Garstang%22+Jericho&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hHc8k2WXln&amp;sig=g7XZfN8II7f9ucJol1jMDLjno7w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt; It was therefore a shock when [[Kathleen Kenyon]] in the 1950s, using more scientific methods than had been available to Garstang, redated Jericho City IV to 1550 BC and found no signs of any habitation at all for the period around 1400 BC. Wood's 1990 reversion of City IV to Garstang's original 1400 BC therefore attracted considerable attention. In 1999, based on a reanalysis of pottery shards (a method which can provide highly accurate dates in the context of the ancient Near East), Wood argued that Jericho could have been captured in the Late Bronze Age by Joshua.&lt;ref&gt;Millard, Alan Ralph, James Karl Hoffmeier,  David Weston Baker, '''Faith, Tradition, and History''' Eisenbrauns, 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-931464-82-9}} p. 15 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qYudy66ymrUC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Bryant+Wood+Jericho&amp;ei=zzC8SIzvM4m6zASkqb33Bw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2-1tfcAanh4oOLrYYCVF9qoVWr1g#PPA15,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; Wood and Piotr Bienkowski debated this in the March/April 1990 issue of Biblical Archaeological Review, with Bienkowski writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wood has attempted to redate the destruction of Jericho City IV from the end of the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1550 B.C.) to the end of the Late Bronze I (c. 1400 BC). He has put forward four lines of argument to support his conclusion. Not a single one of these arguments can stand up to scrutiny. On the contrary, there is strong evidence to confirm Kathleen Kenyon's dating of City IV to the Middle Bronze Age. Wood's attempt to equate the destruction of City IV with the Israelite conquest of Jericho must therefore be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biblicalchronologist.org/answers/bryantwood.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wood responded that he had produced evidence to back his argument, and that any counter-claims should also be backed by fresh evidence. In 1995 fresh evidence became available in the form of charred cereal grains from the City IV destruction layer. Radiocarbon dating of these grains showed that Jericho City IV was destroyed "during the late 17th or the 16th century BC", in line with Kenyon's findings, and that "the fortified Bronze Age city at Tell es-Sultan [Jericho] was not destroyed by ca.1400 BC, as Wood (1990) suggested".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiocarbon.org/Journal/v37n2/Abstracts/213.html Bruins and Van Der Plicht, "Tell Es-Sultan (Jericho): Radiocarbon Results of Short- Lived Cereal and Multiyear Charcoal Samples From the End of the Middle Bronze Age", ''Radiocarbon'' Volume 37, Number 2, 1995.

== Khirbet el-Maqatir ==
Wood directs excavations at [[Khirbet el-Maqatir]], a city which he contends may be the biblical city of Ai.  The traditional location of Ai, [[et-Tell]], was excavated most recently by [[Joseph Callaway]] and was found to have been abandoned during the entirety of the Middle Bronze and Late Bronze Ages.  Khirbet el-Maqatir has produced pottery of the Early Bronze, Middle Bronze, Late Bronze I, Iron Age I, late Hellenistic/early Roman, and Byzantine periods.  Based on initial finds, including a small Late Bronze I fortress in areas A, D, E, and G, Wood's "preliminary conclusion is that the LB I fortress meets the Biblical requirements to be tentatively identified as the fortress 'Ai, referred to in Josh. 7-8."&lt;ref&gt;Wood (2000), 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nearby Khirbet Nisya has also been suggested, by excavator David Livingstone, as an alternative location for Ai.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13430">'''Build–operate–transfer''' ('''BOT''') or '''build–own–operate–transfer''' ('''BOOT''') is a form of project financing, wherein a private entity receives a [[concession (contract)|concession]] from the private or [[public sector]] to finance, design, construct, own, and operate a facility stated in the concession contract. This enables the project proponent to recover its investment, operating and maintenance expenses in the project.

Due to the long-term nature of the arrangement, the fees are usually raised during the concession period. The rate of increase is often tied to a combination of internal and external variables, allowing the proponent to reach a satisfactory [[internal rate of return]] for its investment.

Examples of countries using BOT are [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term used is build–own–operate–transfer (BOOT).
The first BOT was for the China Hotel, built in 1979 by the Hong Kong listed conglomerate [[Hopewell Holdings Ltd]] (controlled by Sir [[Gordon Wu]]).

Forms of [[project finance]] are listed in the sections below.

==BOT (build–operate–transfer)==

BOT finds extensive application in infrastructure projects and in [[public–private partnership]]. In the BOT framework a third party, for example the public administration, delegates to a private sector entity to design and build infrastructure and to operate and maintain these facilities for a certain period. During this period the private party has the responsibility to raise the finance for the project and is entitled to retain all revenues generated by the project and is the owner of the regarded facilities. The facility will be then transferred to the public administration at the end of the [[concession (contract)|concession agreement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BOT - PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center|  url =http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/agreements/concessions-bots-dbos|publisher=World Bank|date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; without any remuneration of the private entity involved. 
Some or even all of the following different parties could be involved in any BOT project:
*The host government: Normally, the government is the initiator of the infrastructure project and decides if the BOT model is appropriate to meet its needs. In addition, the political and economic circumstances are main factors for this decision. The government provides normally support for the project in some form. (provision of the land/ changed [[laws]])
*The concessionaire: The project sponsors who act as concessionaire create a special purpose entity which is capitalised through their financial contributions.
*Lending banks: Most BOT project are funded to a big extent by commercial debt. The bank will be expected to finance the project on "non-recourse" basis meaning that it has recourse to the special purpose entity and all its assets for the repayment of the debt.
*Other lenders: The special purpose entity might have other lenders such as national or regional development banks
*Parties to the project contracts: Because the [[special purpose entity]] has only limited workforce, it will [[subcontract]] a third party to perform its obligations under the concession agreement. Additionally, it has to assure that it has adequate supply contracts in place for the supply of raw materials and other resources necessary for the project
[[File:BOT photo.jpg|thumb|BOT model]]
A BOT Project (build operate transfer project) is typically used to develop a discrete asset rather than a whole network and is generally entirely new or greenfield in nature (although refurbishment may be involved). In a BOT Project the project company or operator generally obtains its revenues through a fee charged to the utility/ government rather than tariffs charged to consumers. A number of projects are called concessions, such as toll road projects, which are new build and have a number of similarities to BOTs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =BOT - PPP in Infrastructure Resource Center|  url =http://pppirc.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/agreements/concessions-bots-dbos|publisher=World Bank|date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In general, a project is financially viable for the private entity if the revenues generated by the project cover its [[cost]] and provide sufficient [[return on investment]]. On the other hand, the viability of the project for the host government depends on its efficiency in comparison with the economics of financing the project with public funds. Even if the host government could borrow money on better conditions than a private company could, other factors could offset this particular advantage. For example, the expertise and efficiency that the private entity is expected to bring as well as the [[risk transfer]]. Therefore, the private entity bears a substantial part of the risk. These are some types of the most common risks involved: 
*[[Political risk]]: especially in the developing countries because of the possibility of dramatic overnight political change.
*Technical risk: construction difficulties, for example unforeseen soil conditions, breakdown of equipment
*Financing risk: foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate fluctuation, [[market risk]] (change in the price of raw materials), income risk (over-optimistic cash-flow forecasts), cost overrun risk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker, Smith|first=Adrian Charles|title=Privatized infrastructure: the build operate transfer approach|year=1995|publisher=Thomas Telford|isbn=978-0-7277-2053-5|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilde Sapte LLP|first=Denton|title=Public Private Partnerships: Bot Techniques and Project Finance|year=2006|publisher=Euromoney Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84374-275-3|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra|first=R.C.|title=Modern Project Management|year=2006|publisher=New Age International|isbn=978-81-224-1616-9|pages=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BOOT (build–own–operate–transfer)==

A BOOT structure differs from BOT in that the private entity owns the works. During the concession period the private company owns and operates the facility with the prime goal to recover the costs of investment and maintenance while trying to achieve higher margin on project. The specific characteristics of BOOT make it suitable for infrastructure projects like highways, roads mass transit, railway transport and power generation and as such they have political importance for the social welfare but are not attractive for other types of private investments. BOOT &amp; BOT are methods which find very extensive application in countries which desire ownership transfer and operations including. Some advantages of BOOT projects are: 
*Encourage private investment
*Inject new foreign capital to the country
*Transfer of technology and know-how
*Completing project within time frame and planned budget
*Providing additional financial source for other priority projects
*Releasing the burden on public budget for infrastructure development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Stafano|title=Project Finance in theory and practice|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-373699-4|pages=414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BOO (build–own–operate)==

&lt;!-- Build Own Operate redirects here --&gt;
In a BOO project ownership of the project remains usually with the project company for example a [[mobile phone network]]. Therefore, the private company gets the benefits of any [[residual value]] of the project. This framework is used when the physical life of the project coincides with the concession period. A BOO scheme involves large amounts of finance and long [[payback period]]. Some examples of BOO projects come from the water treatment plants. This facilities run by private companies process raw water, provided by the public sector entity, into filtered water, which is after returned to the public sector utility to deliver to the customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis/ Grimsey|first=Mervyn/Darrin|title=Public Private Partnerships: the worldwide revolution in infrastructure provision and project finance|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1-84720-226-0|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BLT (build–lease–transfer)==

Under BLT a private entity builds a complete project and leases it to the government. On this way the control over the project is transferred from the project owner to a lessee. In other words, the ownership remains by the [[shareholders]] but operation purposes are leased. After the expiry of the [[leasing]] the ownership of the asset and the operational responsibility are transferred to the government at a previously agreed price. For foreign investors taking into account the [[country risk]] BLT provides good conditions because the project company maintains the [[property rights]] while avoiding [[operational risk]].

==DBFO (design–build–finance–operate)==

Design–build–finance–operate is a project delivery method very similar to BOOT except that there is no actual ownership transfer. Moreover, the contractor assumes the risk of financing till the end of the contract period. The owner then assumes the responsibility for maintenance and operation. Some disadvantages of DBFO are the difficulty with long term relationships and the threat of possible future political changes which may not agree with prior commitments.This model is extensively used in specific infrastructure projects such as [[toll roads]]. The private construction company is responsible for the design and construction of a piece of infrastructure for the government, which is the true owner. Moreover, the private entity has the responsibility to raise finance during the construction and the exploitation period. The [[cash flows]] serve to repay the investment and reward its shareholders. They end up in form of periodical payment to the government for the use of the infrastructure. The government has the advantage that it remains the owner of the facility and at the same time avoids direct payment from the users. Additionally, the government succeeds to avoid getting into [[debt]] and to spread out the cost for the road over the years of exploitation.&lt;ref name="http://www-esd.worldbank.org/pbc_resource_guide/Docs-latest%20edition/cases-and-pdfs/pakkalae5.pdf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pekka|first=Pakkala|title=Innovative Project Delivery Methods for Infrastructure|year=2002|publisher=Finnish Road Enterprise|isbn=978-952-5408-05-8|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DBOT (design–build–operate–transfer)==
This funding option is common when the client has no knowledge of what the project entails. Hence he contracts the project to a company to design, build, operate and then transfer it. Examples of such projects are refinery constructions. 
&lt;ref&gt;Design-Build-Approacheshttp://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_worli-haji-ali-sea-link-will-be-ready-in-4-years_1402669&lt;/ref&gt;

==DCMF (design–construct–manage–finance)==
Some examples for the DCMF model are the prisons or the public hospitals. A private entity is built to design, construct, manage, and finance a facility, based on the specifications of the government. Project cash flows result from the government's payment for the rent of the facility. In the case of the hospitals, the government has the ownership over the facility and has the price and [[quality control]]. The same [[financial model]] could be applied on other projects such as prisons. Therefore, this model could be interpreted as a mean to avoid new indebtedness of [[public finance]].

Most armed forces maintain varying [[Level of readiness|levels]] of readiness by the troops to engage in combat due to economic considerations which vary from minutes to months.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, pp.2-3&lt;/ref&gt; In modern armed forces troops designated [[special forces]] are usually those kept at the highest state of readiness for combat, and are often alerted only a few hours before being committed to combat. Where time is of the essence in [[military action (combat)|military action]] being initiated, the troops, such as pilots of [[interceptor aircraft]], may be kept in constant state of combat readiness.

'''Consent theory''' is a term for the idea in [[social philosophy]] that individuals primarily make decisions as [[Free will|free agent]]s entering into consensual relationships with other free agents, and that this becomes the basis for political governance. An early elaborator of this idea was [[John Locke]], from whom the expression "[[all men are created equal]]" can be traced. Consent theory goes back at least to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Oh, Ye Are For Anarchy!": Consent Theory in the Radical Libertarian Tradition|author=C Watner|publisher=Journal of Libertarian Studies|year=1986|url=http://mises.org/sites/default/files/8_1_9_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
One criticism is after the original administering of consent by the people, subsequent generations often only give [[tacit consent]] to the government. Without the power to refuse consent, true consent cannot be given.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The '''Coup of Kaiserswerth''' ({{lang-de|Staatsstreich von Kaiserswerth}}) in 1062 was a hitherto unprecedented action of several secular and ecclesiastical [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire]] under the leadership of Archbishop [[Anno II|Anno II of Cologne]] against [[Agnes of Poitou|Empress Agnes]], ruling on behalf of her under-age son, King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and against her chosen sub-regent, Bishop [[Henry II of Augsburg]]. By kidnapping the young king and enforcing the handover of the [[Imperial Regalia]], the group gained control of the reins of power in the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]].

== Abduction of the king ==
In early April 1062, eleven-year-old Henry IV and his mother were staying in the ''[[Kaiserpfalz|Königspfalz]]'' of [[Düsseldorf-Kaiserswerth|Kaiserswerth]] (today a quarter in [[Düsseldorf]]), erected by Agnes' late husband Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], where both met with Archbishop Anno II of Cologne. After banqueting together, Anno invited the boy to visit a magnificent ship that he had moored in the River [[Rhine]] nearby. What Henry experienced when he boarded the ship, is related by the contemporary chronicler [[Lambert of Hersfeld]] as follows:
[[File:Kaiser Heinrich IV springt.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Emperor Henry Jumps from the Boat of his Kidnappers'', acquaforte by [[Bernhard Rode]] (1781)]]
{{Quote box

But no sooner had he entered the ship when he was surrounded by the archbishop's hired accomplices, the rowers quickly gathered themselves up, threw themselves behind their oars with all their might and propelled the ship rapidly into the middle of the stream. The king, stunned by these unexpected events and unsure what was happening, could only think that they wanted to attack and murder him, and so plunged headlong into the river, and he would have drowned in the raging waters had not Count Egbert, despite the great danger in which he put himself, dived in after him, and rescued the endangered king from drowning with great difficulty and returned to the ship.
|source = Lampert von Hersfeld, ''Annalen'', p. 75&lt;ref&gt;German translation of the Latin original: ''Kaum aber hatte er das Schiff betreten, da umringten ihn die vom Erzbischof angestellten Helfershelfer, rasch stemmen sich die Ruderer hoch, werfen sich mit aller Kraft in die Riemen und treiben das Schiff blitzschnell in die Mitte des Stroms. Der König, fassungslos über diese unerwarteten Vorgänge und unentschlossen, dachte nichts anderes, als dass man ihm Gewalt antun und ihn ermorden wolle, und stürzte sich kopfüber in den Fluss, und er wäre in den reißenden Fluten ertrunken, wäre dem Gefährdeten nicht Graf Ekbert trotz der großen Gefahr, in die er sich begab, nachgesprungen und hätte er ihn nicht mit Mühe und Not vor dem Untergang gerettet und aufs Schiff zurückgebracht.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Anno then took the king up the river to his [[Cologne]] residence and blackmailed Empress Agnes to hand over the Imperial Regalia. As a consequence the power of the state fell into the hands of the rebels, who, in addition to Anno and Count [[Egbert I, Margrave of Meissen|Egbert of Brunswick]], mentioned by Lambert, also included [[Otto of Northeim]] as well as the Archbishops [[Adalbert of Hamburg|Adalbert of Bremen]] and [[Siegfried I (archbishop of Mainz)|Siegfried of Mainz]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Coup+of+Kaiserswerth&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kQNq5TpYnS&amp;sig=4Fs_A5dSFTX6tArwjdPzM1zql84&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2w53NgPfaAhVhp1kKHe3jAa4Q6AEIVDAK#v=onepage&amp;q=Coup%20of%20Kaiserswerth&amp;f=false Blumenthal, Uta-Renate. ''The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 1988, {{ISBN|9780812213867}}, p. 107]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motives of the kidnappers ==
The motives for the attack are still not entirely clear, especially as the sources for this event are extremely contradictory. The opinion of the contemporary commentators is divided. Lambert's report still seems to be relatively objective when he writes that the kidnappers and Anno, in particular, sought to "rescue the son from the influence of his mother and to seize the administration of the Empire for themselves." Lambert did not speculate on the motives of the conspirators. He points out the possibility that Anno had "acted out of political ambition", but admits that he may have also acted for the good of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert von Hersfeld, ''Annalen'', p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

The assessment of the ''Vita Heinrici IV imperatoris'', however, appears subjective and may be better understood if one assumes that the anonymous author was very close to the royal family. Here, it suggests, ''inter alia'', that the motive for the kidnapping was fear of Agnes' "maturity, wisdom and strict morals". The official reason, that it was not proper for the kingdom to be ruled by a woman, is rejected by the author. Here, he even claims that they had kidnapped the young king only to have unrestricted freedom to expand their own power.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Leben Kaiser Heinrichs IV.'', pp. 415 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno the Saxon]] even more or less states that Henry himself was to blame for his own kidnapping: young Henry "full of royal arrogance hardly [heeded] his mother's admonitions". Anno had him educated "with great care" after his kidnapping. Bruno not only entirely denies that Empress Agnes was so assertive, i.e. he considered her to be too weak (whether in terms of ensuring the proper education of the young king or in terms of her regency, is not clear), but he even praised Anno for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno, ''Sachsenkrieg'', p. 195ff&lt;/ref&gt; His criticism of Henry IV himself is probably explained by the fact that Bruno did not subsequently agree with Henry's politics and saw negative traits in the king from an early age. That he was, politically, not on Agnes' side, is obvious.

Although the sources apparently fail to report anything reliably about the motives of the kidnappers, current research now believes that both the pursuit of power (especially for Anno of Cologne), as well as concern for the neglect and the education of Henry IV were crucial to the case. The rebellion was also directed against Empress Agnes' subregent, Bishop Henry of Augsburg, who was accused of having an "unskillful and pretentious way of handling the business of government".&lt;ref&gt;Mechthild Black-Veldtrup, ''Kaiserin Agnes'', p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to the chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld, "the Empress and the bishop could not escape the suspicion of an affair, because there was a general rumour that such a confidential relationship could not develop without an illicit relationship."&lt;ref&gt;Lampert of Hersfeld, ''Annalen'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
[[File:Heinrich 4 g.jpg|thumb|Emperor Henry IV, [[St. Emmeram's Abbey]], 12th century]]
Although Anno of Cologne had to provide a justification for his actions in summer 1062 at a ''[[Hoftag]]'' assembly, he took over the education of the young king and initially retained the reins of government in his hands. Even when the young king finally ascended the throne, Anno controlled, from that moment on, the fate of the Empire. He did not hesitate to strengthen the power of his [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne electorate]]; politically, he felt himself primarily bound to church reform party. In probably his most significant political act, he headed a 1064 [[synod]] in [[Mantua]] where he reached a resolution of the papal [[Schism (religion)|schism]] between [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]] and [[Honorius II (antipope)|Honorius II]] upon the [[Papal election, 1061|election of 1061]]. According to an expertise delivered by Anno's nephew Bishop [[Burchard II (bishop of Halberstadt)|Burchard II of Halbertsadt]] the synod decided in favour of Alexander.

However, Anno found he had no personal access to Henry, unlike his co-conspirator Adalbert of Bremen, and the two archbishops soon became bitter enemies. The princes had enforced Adalbert's installation as Henry's tutor and he had quickly built up a close relationship with the king, whereby Anno's position became increasingly undermined. Nevertheless, Adalbert of Bremen also ultimately had personal interests primarily in mind and strictly pursued a policy that resulted in "dividends" for his [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen archdiocese]].

After the coup, Bishop Henry of Augsburg was stripped of all governmental powers, as was Empress Agnes. Still, her presence in the Empire continued to be required and until King Henry IV reached his majority, she remained head of the [[Salian dynasty]]. Only through her remaining in the kingdom could she claim the throne for her son. Against this background, Lambert's report that Agnes, on the advice of her counsellors, abandoned her intention to enter a nunnery, is given a firm, legal footing and thus gains in authenticity. It was not until King Henry IV came of age and an [[accolade]] ceremony was held on 29 March 1065 in [[Mainz]], that Agnes could achieve her long-held desire for life in the monastery. But first, she was able to dissuade her son from killing the hated Anno, after he had presented him with his sword.

At the beknighting of the king, imperial power returned to the hands of the rightful ruler. The nearly three-year-long period of transitional reign came to an end, though Adalbert of Bremen remained the principal adviser to Henry until January 1066 at a ''Hoftag'' in [[Trebur]], when, at the bidding of the princes, he was dismissed as counsellor.

The '''Election Funding Authority of New South Wales''' was the agency of the [[Government of New South Wales]] charged with administering the Elections Funding Act 1981. The Authority formerly distributed public funding for the purposes of campaigning by candidates in state elections and handles claims for payments from the state's Political Education Fund. On 1 December 2014 it was abolished and its functions made the responsibility of the [[NSW Electoral Commission]].&lt;ref name="abolished"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/#/view/act/2014/30/whole|title=Electoral and Lobbying Legislation Amendment (Electoral Commission) Act 2014 No 30|publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]]|date=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates for public office in New South Wales previously had obligations under the Election Funding, Expenditure and Disclosures Act 1981 to declare [[Political donations in Australia|political donations]], as well as expenditure on campaigning to the Authority. Disclosures were required to be made by 20 October each year.&lt;ref name="fmau"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/03/federal-mps-among-undeclared-nsw-political-donors |title=Federal MPs among undeclared NSW political donors |author=

The '''Endangered Species Act of 1973''' (ESA; 16 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq.) is one of the few dozens of US environmental laws passed in the 1970s, and serves as the enacting legislation to carry out the provisions outlined in The [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES).&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [http://www.fws.gov/international/cites/ "International Affairs: CITES"] Retrieved on 25 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Designed to protect critically imperiled species from extinction as a "consequence of economic growth and development untempered by adequate concern and conservation", the ESA was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on December 28, 1973.  The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] found that "the plain intent of [[U. S. Congress|Congress]] in enacting" the ESA "was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction, whatever the cost."&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/US/437/437.US.153.76-1701.html "Tennessee Valley Authority v.

==History==
The near-extinction of the [[bison]] and the disappearance of the [[passenger pigeon]] helped drive the call for wildlife conservation starting in the 1900s. Ornithologist [[George Bird Grinnell]] wrote articles on the subject in the magazine ''Forest and Stream'', while [[Joel Asaph Allen]], founder of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]], hammered away in the popular press. The public was introduced to a new concept: [[extinction]].

[[File:Grus americana Sasata.jpg|thumb|Whooping crane]]
Market hunting for the [[Hatmaking|millinery]] trade and for the table was one aspect of the problem.  The early naturalists also killed birds and other wildlife for study, personal [[wikt:curio|curio]] collections and museum pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weidensaul|first=Scott|title=Of A Feather|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2006|pages=135–6|isbn=0-15-101247-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While habitat losses continued as communities and farmland grew, the widespread use of pesticides and the introduction of non-native species also affected wildlife.

One species in particular received widespread attention—the [[whooping crane]].  The species' historical range extended from central Canada south to Mexico, and from Utah to the [[U.S. Atlantic Coast|Atlantic coast]]. Unregulated hunting and habitat loss contributed to a steady decline in the whooping crane population until, by 1890, it had disappeared from its primary breeding range in the north central United States.  It would be another eight years before the first national law regulating wildlife commerce was signed, and another two years before the first version of the endangered species act was passed. The whooping crane population by 1941 was estimated at about only 16 birds still in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/nationalcenter/Endangered/crane/crane.html American Museum of Natural History's webpage on the Whooping Crane.] accessed 7-24-09&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lacey Act of 1900]] was the first federal law that regulated commercial animal markets. It prohibited interstate commerce of animals killed in violation of state game laws, and covered all fish and wildlife and their parts or products, as well as plants. Other legislation followed, including the [[Migratory Bird Conservation Act|Migratory Bird Conservation Act of 1929]], a 1937 treaty prohibiting the hunting of right and gray whales, and the [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act|Bald Eagle Protection Act]] of 1940.  These later laws had a low cost to society–the species were relatively rare–and little opposition was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roman|first=Joe|title=Listed: Dispatches from America's Endangered Species Act|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|page=61|isbn=978-0-674-04751-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the Lacey Act dealt with game animal management and market commerce species, a major shift in focus occurred by 1963 to habitat preservation instead of take regulations. A provision was added by Congress in the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 that provided money for the "acquisition of land, waters...for the preservation of species of fish and wildlife that are threatened with extinction."&lt;ref&gt;Goble, ''Endangered Species Act at Thirty'' p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act of 1966===
The predecessor of the ESA was the Endangered Species Preservation Act of 1966 (P.L. 89-669 ). Passed by Congress, this act permitted the listing of [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] U.S. animal species as endangered and for limited protections upon those animals.

It authorized the Secretary of the Interior to list endangered domestic fish and wildlife and allowed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to spend up to $15 million per year to buy habitats for listed species. It also directed federal land agencies to preserve habitat on their lands.  The Act also consolidated and even expanded authority for the Secretary of the Interior to manage and administer the [[National Wildlife Refuge System]]. Other public agencies were encouraged, but not required, to protect species.&lt;ref&gt;"Native Fish and Wildlife Endangered Species,"  ''Federal Register'', vol. 32, no. 48, March 11, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The act did not address the commerce in endangered species and parts.&lt;ref&gt;Czech, Brian ''The Endangered Species Act'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 1967 the first list of endangered species was issued under the act. It included 14 mammals, 36 birds, 6 reptiles and amphibians and 22 fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=78 Species Listed Near Extinction; Udall Issues Inventory With Appeal to Save Them|date=March 12, 1967|publisher=''New York Times''|author=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This first list is referred to as the "Class of '67" in  ''The Endangered Species Act at Thirty'', Volume 1, which concludes that habitat destruction, the biggest threat to those 78 species, is still the same threat to the currently listed species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcove|first=David S.|author2=Margaret McMillan|title=The Endangered Species Act at Thirty |editor=Dale Goble |editor2=J. Micharl Scott |editor3=Frank W. Davis|publisher=Island Press|year=2006|volume=1|page=48|chapter=Class of '67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included only vertebrates because the Department of Interior's definition of "fish and wildlife" was limited to vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;ESA at Thirty, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; However, with time, researchers noticed that the animals on the endangered species list still were not getting enough protection, thus further threatening their extinction. The endangered species program was expanded by the Endangered Species Act of 1969.

===Amendment of 1969===
{{Main|Endangered Species Act of 1969}}
The [[Endangered Species Act of 1969|Endangered Species Conservation Act]] (P. L. 91–135), passed in December, 1969, amended the original law to provide additional protection to species in danger of  "worldwide extinction"  by prohibiting their importation and subsequent sale in the United States. It expanded the Lacey Act's ban on interstate commerce to include [[mammals]], [[reptiles]], [[amphibians]], [[mollusks]] and [[crustaceans]]. Reptiles were added mainly to reduce the rampant [[poaching]] of [[alligator]]s and [[crocodile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Douglas|author2=Joel Sartore|title=The Company We Keep|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=1996|pages=19–21|isbn=0-7922-3310-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This law was the first time that [[invertebrate]]s were included for protection.

The amendment called for an international meeting to adopt a convention or treaty to conserve endangered species.
That meeting was held in Washington, D.C., in February, 1973 and produced the comprehensive multilateral treaty known as [[CITES]] or Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.

===Endangered Species Act===
[[File:Endangered Species Act.pdf|frameless|upright=0.9|right]]

President [[Richard Nixon]] declared current species conservation efforts to be inadequate and called on the [[93rd United States Congress]] to pass comprehensive endangered species legislation.&lt;ref name=StanfordEnvLaw&gt;{{cite journal | author=Nixon. R | title= Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program | year=1972 | volume=51 | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=3731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress responded with a completely rewritten law, the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which was signed by Nixon on December 28, 1973 ({{USPL|93|205}}). It was written by a team of lawyers and scientists, including Dr. [[Russell E. Train]], the first appointed head of the [[Council on Environmental Quality]] (CEQ), an outgrowth of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) of 1969.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite webpage|title=Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.epa.gov/history/admin/agency/train.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203080442/http://www.epa.gov/history/admin/agency/train.htm |archivedate=2011-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rinde|first1=Meir|title=Richard Nixon and the Rise of American Environmentalism |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1|pages=16–29|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/richard-nixon-and-the-rise-of-american-environmentalism|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Train was assisted by a core group of staffers, including Dr. Earl Baysinger at EPA, Dick Gutting, and Dr. Gerard A. "Jerry" Bertrand, a Ph.D marine biologist by training (Oregon State University), who had transferred from his post as the scientific adviser to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, office of the Commandant of the Corps, to join the newly formed White House office.&lt;ref name=PERMIAN&gt;{{cite webpage | title=Permian Global | url=http://www.zoominfo.com/p/Gerard-Bertrand/1850081}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff, under Dr. Train's leadership, incorporated dozens of new principles and ideas into the landmark legislation, crafting a document that completely changed the direction of environmental conservation in the United States. Dr. Bertrand is credited with writing the most challenged section of the Act, the "takings" clause – Section 2. 

The stated purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to protect species and also "the ecosystems upon which they depend." California historian [[Kevin Starr]] was more emphatic when he said: "The Endangered Species Act of 1982 is the Magna Carta of the environmental movement."&lt;ref&gt;''Water on the Edge'' KVIE-Sacramento public television documentary (DVD) hosted by Lisa McRae.  The Water Education Foundation, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESA is administered by two federal agencies, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) (which includes the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]], or NMFS). NOAA handles marine species, and the FWS has responsibility over freshwater fish and all other species. Species that occur in both habitats (e.g. sea [[turtle]]s and [[Atlantic sturgeon]]) are jointly managed.

In March 2008, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that documents showed that the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]], beginning in 2001, had erected "pervasive bureaucratic obstacles" that limited the number of species protected under the act:
* From 2000 to 2003, until a [[U.S. District Court]] overturned the decision, [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|Fish and Wildlife Service]] officials said that if that agency identified a species as a candidate for the list, citizens could not file petitions for that species.
* Interior Department personnel were told they could use "info from files that refutes petitions but not anything that supports" petitions filed to protect species.
* Senior department officials revised a longstanding policy that rated the threat to various species based primarily on their populations within U.S. borders, giving more weight to populations in Canada and Mexico, countries with less extensive regulations than the U.S.
* Officials changed the way species were evaluated under the act by considering where the species currently lived, rather than where they used to exist.
* Senior officials repeatedly dismissed the views of scientific advisers who said that species should be protected.&lt;ref name="WP-23Mar08"&gt;Juliet Eilperin, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/22/AR2008032202204.html "Since '01, Guarding Species Is Harder: Endangered Listings Drop Under Bush"], ''Washington Post'', March 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the House of Representatives passed the 21st Century Endangered Species Transparency Act, which would require the government to disclose the data it uses to determine species classification.

==Preventing extinction==
The ESA's primary goal is to prevent the extinction of imperiled plant and animal life, and secondly, to recover and maintain those populations by removing or lessening threats to their survival.

===Petition and listing===
To be considered for listing, the species must meet one of five criteria (section 4(a)(1)):

1. There is the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its [[habitat]] or range.&lt;br/&gt;
2. An over utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes.&lt;br/&gt;
3. The species is declining due to disease or [[predation]].&lt;br/&gt;
4. There is an inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;
5. There are other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.

Potential candidate species are then prioritized, with "emergency listing" given the highest priority. Species that face a "significant risk to their well being" are in this category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate4.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/PDFgate.cgi?WAISdocID=602280159633+1+2+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve|title=Notice|work=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife; Final Listing Priority Guidance for FY 2000|publisher=Federal Register|pages= 27114–19|accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A species can be listed in two ways. The [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) or NOAA Fisheries (also called the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]) can directly list a species through its candidate assessment program, or an individual or organizational petition may request that the FWS or NMFS list a species. A "species" under the act can be a true [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[species]], a [[subspecies]], or in the case of vertebrates, a "[[distinct population segment]]." The procedures are the same for both types except with the person/organization petition, there is a 90-day screening period.

During the listing process, economic factors cannot be considered, but must be " based solely on the best scientific and commercial data available."&lt;ref&gt;16 U.S.C. §1533(b)(1)(A)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1982 amendment to the ESA added the word "solely" to prevent any consideration other than the biological status of the species. Congress rejected President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] [[s:12291|12291]] which required economic analysis of all government agency actions. The House committee's statement was "that economic considerations have no relevance to determinations regarding the status of species."&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The very opposite result happened with the 1978 amendment where Congress added the words "...taking into consideration the economic impact..." in the provision on [[critical habitat]] designation.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;16 U.S.C.  1533(b)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1978 amendment linked the listing procedure with critical habitat designation and economic considerations, which almost completely halted new listings, with almost 2,000 species being withdrawn from consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listing process===
After receiving a petition to list a species, the two federal agencies take the following steps, or rulemaking procedures, with each step being published in the ''[[Federal Register]]'', the US government's official journal of proposed or adopted rules and regulations:

1. If a petition presents information that the species may be imperiled, a screening period of 90 days begins (interested persons and/or organization petitions only). If the petition does not present substantial information to support listing, it is denied.

2.  If the information is substantial, a status review is started, which is a comprehensive assessment of a species' biological status and threats, with a result of :  "warranted", "not warranted," or "warranted but precluded."
* A finding of not warranted,  the listing process ends.
* Warranted finding means the agencies publish a 12-month finding (a proposed rule) within one year of the date of the petition, proposing to list the species as threatened or endangered.  Comments are solicited from the public, and one or more public hearings may be held. Three expert opinions from appropriate and independent specialists may be included, but this is voluntary.
* A "warranted but precluded" finding is automatically recycled back through the 12-month process indefinitely until a result of either "not warranted" or "warranted" is determined. The agencies monitor the status of any "warranted but precluded" species.&lt;ref&gt;16 U.S.C.  1533 (b)(3)(C)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt;
Essentially the "warranted but precluded" finding is a deferral added by the 1982 amendment to the ESA.  It means other, higher-priority actions will take precedence.&lt;ref&gt;ESA at Thirty p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, an emergency listing of a rare plant growing in a wetland that is scheduled to be filled in for housing construction would be a "higher-priority".

3. Within another year, a final determination (a final rule) must be made on whether to list the species. The final rule time limit may be extended for 6 months and listings may be grouped together according to similar geography, threats, habitat or taxonomy.

The annual rate of listing (i.e., classifying species as "threatened" or "endangered") increased steadily from the [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] administration (47 listings, 15 per year) through [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] (126 listings, 32 per year), [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] (255 listings, 32 per year), [[George H. W. Bush]] (231 listings, 58 per year), and [[William Clinton|Clinton]] (521 listings, 65 per year) before decline to its lowest rate under [[George W. Bush]] (60 listings, 8 per year as of 5/24/08).&lt;ref name=GreenwaldSuckling2006&gt;{{cite book| first = Noah| last = Greenwald |author2=K. Suckling |author3=M.

The rate of listing is strongly correlated with citizen involvement and mandatory timelines: as agency discretion decreases and citizen involvement increases (i.e. filing of petitions and lawsuits) the rate of listing increases.&lt;ref name=GreenwaldSuckling2006/&gt;  Citizen involvement has been shown to identify species not moving through the process efficiently,&lt;ref name="Puckett_etal2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puckett|first1=Emily E.|last2=Kesler|first2=Dylan C.|last3=Greenwald|first3=D.

===Public notice, comments and judicial review===
[[Public notice]] is given through legal notices in newspapers, and communicated to state and county agencies within the species'  area. Foreign nations may also receive notice of a listing.
A [[Hearing (law)|public hearing]] is mandatory if any person has requested one within 45 days of the published notice.&lt;ref&gt;U.S.C 1533(b)(5)(A)-(E)&lt;/ref&gt;
"The purpose of the notice and comment requirement is to provide for meaningful public participation in the rulemaking process." summarized the Ninth Circuit court in the case of ''Idaho Farm Bureau Federation v. Babbitt''.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Species survival and recovery==

===Critical habitat===
The provision of the law in Section 4 that establishes [[critical habitat]] is a regulatory link between habitat protection and recovery goals, requiring the identification and protection of all lands, water and air necessary to recover endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;ESA at Thirty p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
To determine what exactly is critical habitat, the needs of open space for individual and population growth, food, water, light or other nutritional requirements, breeding sites, seed germination and dispersal needs, and lack of disturbances are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford pp. 61–4&lt;/ref&gt;

As habitat loss is the primary threat to most imperiled species, the Endangered Species Act of 1973 allowed the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to designate specific areas as protected "critical habitat" zones. In 1978, Congress amended the law to make critical habitat designation a mandatory requirement for all threatened and endangered species.

The amendment also added [[Economy|economics]] into the process of determining habitat: "...shall designate critical habitat... on the basis of the best scientific data available and after taking into consideration the economic impact, and any other impact, of specifying... area as critical habitat."&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;
The congressional report on the 1978 amendment described the conflict between the new Section 4 additions and the rest of the law:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"... the critical habitat provision is a startling section which is wholly inconsistent with the rest of the legislation.  It constitutes a loophole which could readily be abused by any Secretary ... who is vulnerable to political pressure or who is not sympathetic to the basic purposes of the Endangered Species Act."-- House of Representatives Report 95-1625, at 69 (1978)&lt;ref&gt;Stanford p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978|amendment of 1978]] added economic considerations and the 1982 amendment prevented economic considerations.

Several studies on the effect of critical habitat designation on species' recovery rates have been done between 1997 and 2003.  Although it has been criticized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/04/0418_050418_endangered_2.html|title=U.S. Endangered Species Act Works, Study Finds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Taylor study in 2003&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biological Diversity, authors K.F. Suckling, J.R. Rachlinski&lt;/ref&gt; found that, "species with critical habitat were... twice as likely to be improving...."&lt;ref&gt;Stanford p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical habitats are required to contain "all areas essential to the conservation" of the imperiled species, and may be on private or public lands.  The Fish and Wildlife Service has a policy limiting designation to lands and waters within the U.S. and both federal agencies may exclude essential areas if they determine that economic or other costs exceed the benefit. The ESA is mute about how such costs and benefits are to be determined.

All federal agencies are prohibited from authorizing, funding or carrying out actions that "destroy or adversely modify" critical habitats (Section 7(a) (2)). While the regulatory aspect of critical habitat does not apply directly to private and other non-federal landowners, large-scale development, [[logging]] and [[mining]] projects on private and state land typically require a federal permit and thus become subject to critical habitat regulations. Outside or in parallel with regulatory processes, critical habitats also focus and encourage voluntary actions such as land purchases, grant making, restoration, and establishment of [[nature reserve|reserves]].&lt;ref name=SucklingTaylor2006&gt;{{cite book| first = Kieran| last = Suckling|author2=M. Taylor| year = 2006| title = The Endangered Species Act at 30: Vol. 1: Renewing the Conservation Promise| chapter = Critical Habitat Recovery | editor = D.D. Goble |editor2=J.M. Scott |editor3=F.W. Davis| page  = 77| publisher = Island Press| location = Washington, D.C.| asin = 1597260096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESA requires that critical habitat be designated at the time of or within one year of a species being placed on the endangered list. In practice, most designations occur several years after listing.&lt;ref name=SucklingTaylor2006/&gt; Between 1978 and 1986 the FWS regularly designated critical habitat. In 1986 the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] issued a [[regulation]] limiting the protective status of critical habitat. As a result, few critical habitats were designated between 1986 and the late 1990s. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a series of [[court order]]s invalidated the Reagan regulations and forced the FWS and NMFS to designate several hundred critical habitats, especially in Hawaii, California and other western states. Midwest and Eastern states received less critical habitat, primarily on rivers and coastlines. As of December, 2006, the Reagan regulation has not yet been replaced though its use has been suspended. Nonetheless, the agencies have generally changed course and since about 2005 have tried to designate critical habitat at or near the time of listing.

Most provisions of the ESA revolve around preventing extinction. Critical habitat is one of the few that focus on recovery. Species with critical habitat are twice as likely to be recovering as species without critical habitat.&lt;ref name=TaylorSuckling2005/&gt;

===Plans, permits, and agreements===
The combined result of the amendments to the Endangered Species Act have created a law vastly different from the ESA of 1973. It is now a flexible, permitting statute. For example, the law now permits "incidental takes" (accidental killing or harming a listed species). Congress added the requirements for "incidental take statement", and authorized a "incidental take permit" in conjunction with  "habitat conservation plans".

More changes were made in the 1990s in an attempt by Secretary of the Interior [[Bruce Babbitt]] to shield the ESA from a Congress hostile to the law.  He instituted incentive-based strategies such as candidate conservation agreements and "safe harbor" agreements&lt;ref&gt;ESA at 30, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; that would balance the goals of economic development and conservation.

====Recovery plan====
Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are required to create an [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan]] outlining the goals, tasks required, likely costs, and estimated timeline to recover endangered species (i.e., increase their numbers and improve their management to the point where they can be removed from the endangered list).&lt;ref&gt;The ESA does allow FWS and NMFS to forgo a recovery plan by declaring it will not benefit the species, but this provision has rarely been invoked. It was most famously used to deny a recovery plan to the [[northern spotted owl]] in 1991, but in 2006 the FWS changed course and announced it would complete a plan for the species.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ESA does not specify when a recovery plan must be completed. The FWS has a policy specifying completion within three years of the species being listed, but the average time to completion is approximately six years.&lt;ref name=GreenwaldSuckling2006/&gt; The annual rate of recovery plan completion increased steadily from the Ford administration (4) through Carter (9), Reagan (30), Bush I (44), and Clinton (72), but declined under Bush II (16 per year as of 9/1/06).&lt;ref name=GreenwaldSuckling2006/&gt;

The goal of the law is to make itself unnecessary, and recovery plans are a means toward that goal.&lt;ref name="ref_a"&gt;16 U.S.C. §1533(f)&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery plans became more specific after 1988 when Congress added provisions to Section 4(f) of the law that spelled out the minimum contents of a recovery plan. Three types of information must be included:
* A description of "site-specific" management actions to make the plan as explicit as possible.
* The "objective, measurable criteria" to serve as a baseline for judging when and how well a species is recovering.
* An estimate of money and resources needed to achieve the goal of recovery and delisting.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford pp. 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment also added [[General public|public]] participation to the process. There is a ranking order, similar to the listing procedures, for recovery plans, with the highest priority being for species most likely to benefit from recovery plans, especially when the threat is from construction, or other developmental or economic activity.&lt;ref name="ref_a" /&gt; Recovery plans cover domestic and migratory species.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exemptions====
Exemptions can and do occur.  The ESA requires federal agencies to consult with the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (FWS) or the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] (NMFS) if any project occurs in the habitat of a listed species. An example of such a project might be a [[timber harvesting|timber harvest]] proposed by the [[US Forest Service]]. If the timber harvest could impact a listed species, a biological assessment is prepared by the Forest Service and reviewed by the FWS or NMFS or both.

The question to be answered is whether a listed species will be harmed by the action and, if so, how the harm can be minimized. If harm cannot be avoided, the project agency can seek an exemption from the Endangered Species Committee, an ad hoc panel composed of members from the executive branch and at least one appointee from the state where the project is to occur. Five of the seven committee members must vote for the exemption to allow taking (to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or significant habitat modification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Species Act|url=http://www.fws.gov/cno/fire/7_ESA%20Compliance%20and%20Strategies_Vicki%20Campbell%20FWS.ppt|publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to attempt to engage in any such conduct) of listed species.&lt;ref&gt;16 U.S.C. §1536(e)&lt;/ref&gt;

Long before the exemption is considered by the Endangered Species Committee, the Forest Service, and either the FWS or the NMFS will have consulted on the biological implications of the timber harvest. The consultation can be informal, to determine if harm may occur; and then formal if the harm is believed to be likely. The questions to be answered in these consultations are whether the species will be harmed, whether the habitat will be harmed and if the action will aid or hinder the recovery of the listed species.&lt;ref&gt;50 C.F.R. §402.13(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

If harm is likely to occur, the consultation evaluates whether "reasonable and prudent alternatives" exist to minimize harm. If an alternative does not exist, the FWS or NMFS will issue an opinion that the action constitutes "jeopardy" to the listed species either directly or indirectly.  The project cannot then occur unless exempted by the Endangered Species Committee.

The Committee must make a decision on the exemption within 30 days, when its findings are published in the ''Federal Register''. The findings can be challenged in federal court. In 1992, one such challenge was the case of'' Portland Audubon Society'' v. ''Endangered Species Committee'' heard in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;ref name="Justia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/984/1534/356273/|title= Portland Audubon Society'' v. ''Endangered Species Committee''|publisher=Justia|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court found that three members had been in illegal ''[[ex parte]]'' contact with the then-President George H.W. Bush, a violation of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]]. The committee's exemption was for the [[Bureau of Land Management]]'s timber sale and "incidental takes" of the endangered northern spotted owl in Oregon.&lt;ref name="Justia" /&gt;

There have been six instances as of 2009 in which the exemption process was initiated. Of these six, one was granted, one was partially granted, one was denied and three were withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Endangered_Species_Act,_United_States Encyclopedia of Earth] accessed August 21, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Donald Baur, in ''The Endangered Species Act: law, policy, and perspectives'', concluded," ... the exemption provision is basically a nonfactor in the administration of the ESA. A major reason, of course, is that so few consultations result in jeopardy opinions, and those that do almost always result in the identification of reasonable and prudent alternatives to avoid jeopardy."&lt;ref&gt;Donald C. Baur, William Robert Irvin The Endangered Species Act: law, policy, and perspectives Published by American Bar Association. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

====Habitat Conservation Plans====
More than half of habitat for listed species is on non-federal property, owned by citizens, states, local governments, tribal governments and private organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Before the law was amended in 1982, a listed species could be taken only for [[Biology|scientific]] or research purposes. The amendment created a permit process to circumvent the take prohibition called a [[Habitat Conservation Plan]] or HCP to give incentives to non-federal land managers and private landowners to help protect listed and unlisted species, while allowing economic development that may harm ("take") the species.

The [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] defines the process as: "The purpose of the habitat conservation planning process associated with the permit is to ensure there is adequate minimizing and mitigating of the effects of the authorized incidental take. The purpose of the incidental take permit is to authorize the incidental take of a listed species, not to authorize the activities that result in take."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/Endangered/pdfs/HCP/HCP_Incidental_Take.pdf ''Habitat Conservation Plans: Section 10 of the Endangered Species Act'' p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

The person or organization submits a HCP and if approved by the agency (FWS or NMFS), will be issued an [[Incidental Take Permit]] (ITP) which allows a certain number of "takes" of the listed species. The permit may be revoked at any time and can allow incidental takes for varying amounts of time.  For instance, the San Bruno Habitat Conservation Plan/ Incidental Take Permit is good for 30 years and the Wal-Mart store (in Florida) permit expires after one year. Because the permit is issued by a federal agency to a private party, it is a federal action-which means other federal laws can apply, such as the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] or NEPA. A notice of the permit application action is published in the ''Federal Register'' and a public comment period of 30 to 90 days begins.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford pp. 147–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[US Congress]] was urged to create the exemption by proponents of a conservation plan on [[San Bruno Mountain]], California that was drafted in the early 1980s and is the first HCP in the nation. In the conference report on the 1982 amendments, Congress specified that it intended the San Bruno plan to act "as a model" for future conservation plans developed under the incidental take exemption provision and that "the adequacy of similar conservation plans should be measured against the San Bruno plan".  Congress further noted that the San Bruno plan was based on "an independent exhaustive biological study" and protected at least 87% of the habitat of the listed butterflies that led to the development of the HCP.&lt;ref&gt;(H.R. Rep. No. 835, 97th Cong., 2nd Sess. 32, 1982. pp. 31–32) [http://www.umich.edu/~esupdate/library/97.07-08/hcp.html] ''Introduction to Habitat Conservation Planning''
By: Peter Aengst, Jeremy Anderson, Jay Chamberlin, Christopher Grunewald, Susan Loucks, Elizabeth Wheatley, and Steven Yaffee accessed August 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing scientific recognition of the role of private lands for endangered species recovery and the landmark 1981 court decision in ''Palila'' v. ''Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources''  both contributed to making Habitat Conservation Plans/ Incidental Take Permits  "a major force for wildlife conservation and a major headache to the development community", wrote Robert D. Thornton in the 1991 ''Environmental Law'' article, ''Searching for Consensus and Predictability: Habitat Conservation Planning under the Endangered Species Act of 1973''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umich.edu/~esupdate/library/97.07-08/hcp.html  ''Introduction to Habitat Conservation Planning'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===="No Surprises" rule====
The "No Surprises" rule is meant to protect the landowner if "unforeseen circumstances" occur which make the landowner's efforts to prevent or mitigate harm to the species fall short. The "No Surprises" policy may be the most controversial of the recent reforms of the law, because once an Incidental Take Permit is granted, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) loses much ability to further protect a species if the mitigation measures by the landowner prove insufficient. The landowner or permittee would not be required to set aside additional land or pay more in conservation money. The federal government would have to pay for additional protection measures.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford pp. 170–1&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Safe Harbor" agreements====
The "Safe Harbor" agreement is a voluntary agreement between the private landowner and FWS. The landowner agrees to alter the property to benefit or even attract a listed or proposed species in exchange for assurances that the FWS will permit future "takes" above a pre-determined level. The policy relies on the "enhancement of survival" provision of Section  §1539(a)(1)(A). A landowner can have either a "Safe Harbor" agreement or an Incidental Take Permit, or both. The policy was developed by the Clinton Administration in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford pp168–9&lt;/ref&gt;

====Candidate Conservation Agreements====
The Candidate Conservation Agreement is closely related to the "Safe Harbor" agreement, the main difference is that the Candidate Conservation Agreements With Assurances(CCA) are meant to protect ''unlisted'' species by providing incentives to private landowners and land managing agencies to restore, enhance or maintain habitat of unlisted species which are declining and have the potential to become threatened or endangered if critical habitat is not protected. The FWS will then assure that if, in the future the unlisted species becomes listed, the landowner will not be required to do more than already agreed upon in the CCA.

====Experimental Populations====
The Experimental Population Provision encourages introductions of species into formerly occupied or new habitat without the full range of legal restrictions for endangered species.  The provision was added to the act in 1982 to encourage landowner support for species survival and recovery.  Experimental populations could be used for the [[assisted migration]] of endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shirey | first1 = P.D. | last2 = Lamberti | first2 = G.A. | year = 2010 | title = Assisted colonization under the U.S. Endangered Species Act | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/123196255/PDFSTART | journal = Conservation Letters | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 45–52 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-263x.2009.00083.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Delisting==
[[File:Glaucomys sabrinus.jpg|thumb|[[Northern flying squirrel]]]]

To delist species, several factors are considered:  the threats are eliminated or controlled, population size and growth, and the stability of habitat quality and quantity. Also, over a dozen species have been delisted due to inaccurate data putting them on the list in the first place.

There is also "downlisting" of a species where some of the threats have been controlled and the population has met recovery objectives, then the species can be reclassified to "threatened" from "endangered"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/endangered/factsheets/delisting.pdf USFWS "Delisting a Species"] accessed August 25, 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326130813/http://www.fws.gov/endangered/factsheets/delisting.pdf |date=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two examples of animal species recently delisted are: the Virginia [[northern flying squirrel]] (subspecies) on August, 2008, which had been listed since 1985, and the [[gray wolf]] (Northern Rocky Mountain DPS). On April 15, 2011, President Obama signed the Department of Defense and Full-Year Appropriations Act of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-05-05/html/2011-10860.htm|title=Federal Register, Volume 76 Issue 87 (Thursday, May 5, 2011)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A section of that Appropriations Act directed the Secretary of the Interior to reissue within 60 days of enactment the final rule published on April 2, 2009, that identified the Northern Rocky Mountain population of gray wolf (''Canis lupus'') as a distinct population segment (DPS) and to revise the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife by removing most of the gray wolves in the DPS.

The US Fish and Wildlife Service's delisting report lists four plants that have recovered:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do FWS Delisting Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728035106/http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |date=2007-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

===Positive effects===
As of September 2012, fifty-six species have been delisted; twenty-eight due to recovery, ten due to extinction (seven of which are believed to have been extinct prior to being listed), ten due to changes in taxonomic classification practices, six due to discovery of new populations, one due to an error in the listing rule, and one due to an amendment to the Endangered Species Act specifically requiring the species delisting.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] [http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/reports/delisting-report Threatened and Endangered Species System]&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five others have been down listed from "endangered" to "threatened" status.

Some have argued that the recovery of DDT-threatened species such as the [[bald eagle]], [[brown pelican]] and [[peregrine falcon]] should be attributed to the 1972 ban on [[DDT]] by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]. rather than the Endangered Species Act, however, the listing of these species as endangered was a substantial cause of Congress instituting the ban and many non-DDT oriented actions were taken on their behalf under the Endangered Species Act (i.e. captive breeding, habitat protection, and protection from disturbance).

As of October 28, 2012, there are 2,052 total (foreign and domestic)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/Boxscore.do|title=Listed Species Summary (Boxscore)|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|last=Service|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; species on the threatened and endangered lists. However, many species have become extinct while on the candidate list or otherwise under consideration for listing.&lt;ref name=GreenwaldSuckling2006/&gt;

[[File:Key deer male.jpg|thumb|[[Key deer]]]]
Species which increased in population size since being placed on the endangered list include:
* [[Bald eagle]] (increased from 417 to 11,040 pairs between 1963 and 2007); removed from list 2007
* [[Whooping crane]] (increased from 54 to 436 birds between 1967 and 2003)
* [[Kirtland's warbler]] (increased from 210 to 1,415 pairs between 1971 and 2005)
* [[Peregrine falcon]] (increased from 324 to 1,700 pairs between 1975 and 2000); removed from list 1999
* [[Gray wolf]] (populations increased dramatically in the Northern Rockies and Western Great Lakes States)
* [[Mexican wolf]] (increased to minimum population of 109 wolves in 2014 in southwest New Mexico and southeast Arizona)
* [[Red wolf]] (increased from 17 in 1980 to 257 in 2003)
* [[Gray whale]] (increased from 13,095 to 26,635 whales between 1968 and 1998); removed from list (Debated because whaling was banned before the ESA was set in place and that the ESA had nothing to do with the natural population increase since the cease of massive whaling [excluding Native American tribal whaling])
* [[Grizzly bear]] (increased from about 271 to over 580 bears in the Yellowstone area between 1975 and 2005); removed from list March 22, 2007
* [[Sea otter|California’s southern sea otter]] (increased from 1,789 in 1976 to 2,735 in 2005)
* [[Castilleja|San Clemente Indian paintbrush]] (increased from 500 plants in 1979 to more than 3,500 in 1997)
* [[Key deer|Florida's Key deer]] (increased from 200 in 1971 to 750 in 2001)
* [[Big Bend gambusia]] (increased from a couple dozen to a population of over 50,000)
* [[Hawaiian goose]] (increased from 400 birds in 1980 to 1,275 in 2003)
* [[Virginia big-eared bat]] (increased from 3,500 in 1979 to 18,442 in 2004)
* [[Black-footed ferret]] (increased from 18 in 1986 to 600 in 2006)

===Criticism===
Opponents of the Endangered Species Act argue that with over 2,000 endangered species listed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/listedPlants.jsp|title=Listed Plants|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|last=Service|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/listedAnimals.jsp|title=Listed Animals|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|last=Service|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014231847/http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/pub/listedAnimals.jsp|archivedate=14 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only 28 delisted due to recovery, the success rate of 1% over nearly three decades proves that there needs to be serious reform in their methods to actually help the endangered animals and plants.
Others argue that the ESA may encourage preemptive habitat destruction by landowners who fear losing the use of their land because of the presence of an endangered species; known colloquially as "[[Shoot, Shovel and Shut-Up]]."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/magazine/20wwln-freak-t.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=unintended%20consequences&amp;st=cse&amp;oref=slogin ''Unintended Consequences''], New York Times Magazine, 20 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  One example of such [[perverse incentive]]s is the case of a forest owner who, in response to ESA listing of the [[red-cockaded woodpecker]], increased harvesting and shortened the age at which he harvests his trees to ensure that they do not become old enough to become suitable habitat.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Stroup. [http://www.perc.org/perc.php?id=648], ''The Endangered Species Act: Making Innocent Species the Enemy''  PERC Policy Series: April 1995&lt;/ref&gt; While no studies have shown that the Act's negative effects, in total, exceed the positive effects, many economists believe that finding a way to reduce such perverse incentives would lead to more effective protection of endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Gardner M. Jr. | last2 = Shogren | first2 = Jason F. | year = 1998 | title = Economics of the Endangered Species Act | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 3–20 | doi=10.1257/jep.12.3.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research published in 1999 by Alan Green and the [[Center for Public Integrity]] (CPI), loopholes in the ESA are commonly exploited in the [[Exotic pet|exotic pet trade]].  Although the legislation prohibits interstate and foreign transactions for list species, no provisions are made for in-state commerce, allowing these animals to be sold to [[Zoo#Roadside zoos|roadside zoos]] and private collectors.  Additionally, the ESA allows listed species to be shipped across state lines as long as they are not sold.  According to Green and the CPI, this allows dealers to "donate" listed species through supposed "breeding loans" to anyone, and in return they can legally receive a reciprocal monetary "donation" from the receiving party.{{sfn|Green|The Center for Public Integrity|1999| pp=115 &amp; 120}}  Furthermore, an interview with an endangered species specialist at the US Fish and Wildlife Service revealed that the agency does not have sufficient staff to perform undercover investigations, which would catch these false "donations" and other mislabeled transactions.{{sfn|Green|The Center for Public Integrity|1999| p=120}}

Green and the CPI further noted another exploit of the ESA in their discussion of the critically endangered [[cotton-top tamarin]] (''Saguinus oedipus'').  Not only had they found documentation that 151 of these primates had inadvertently made their way from the [[Harvard College|Harvard]]-affiliated [[New England Regional Primate Research Center]] into the exotic pet trade through the aforementioned loophole,{{sfn|Green|The Center for Public Integrity|1999| pp=113–115}} but in October 1976, over 800&amp;nbsp;cotton-top tamarins were imported into the United States in order to beat the official listing of the species under the ESA.{{sfn|Green|The Center for Public Integrity|1999| p=117}}

==State endangered species lists==
Section 6 of the Endangered Species Act&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_16_00001535----000-.html&lt;/ref&gt; provided funding for development of programs for management of threatened and endangered species by state wildlife agencies.&lt;ref&gt;16 ''U.S. Code'' 1535&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, lists of endangered and threatened species within their boundaries have been prepared by each state. These state lists often include species which are considered endangered or threatened within a specific state but not within all states, and which therefore are not included on the national list of endangered and threatened species. Examples include Florida,&lt;ref&gt;[http://myfwc.com/imperiledspecies/species.htm Florida Endangered &amp; Threatened Species List]&lt;/ref&gt; Minnesota,&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/natural_resources/ets/endlist.pdf Minnesota Endangered &amp; Threatened Species List]&lt;/ref&gt; Maine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/species/endangered_species/state_federal_list.htm Compare: Maine State &amp; Federal Endangered &amp; Threatened Species Lists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207152748/http://www.maine.gov/ifw/wildlife/species/endangered_species/state_federal_list.htm |date=2008-12-07 }} [https://web.archive.org/web/20061002110422/http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/SpeciesReport.do with Maine Animals]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penalties===
There are different degrees of violation with the law. The most punishable offenses are trafficking, and any act of knowingly "taking" (which includes harming, wounding, or killing) an endangered species.

The penalties for these violations can be a maximum fine of up to $50,000 or imprisonment for one year, or both, and [[civil penalties]] of up to $25,000 per violation may be assessed. Lists of violations and exact fines are available through the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] web-site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gc.noaa.gov/schedules/6-ESA/EnadangeredSpeciesAct.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

One provision of this law is that no penalty may be imposed if, by a [[preponderance of the evidence]] that the act was in self-defense. The law also eliminates criminal penalties for accidentally killing listed species during farming and ranching activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fws.gov/Endangered/hcp/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406020407/http://www.fws.gov/Endangered/hcp/ |date=April 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to fines or imprisonment, a license, permit, or other agreement issued by a federal agency that authorized an individual to import or export fish, wildlife, or plants may be revoked, suspended or modified. Any federal hunting or fishing permits that were issued to a person who violates the ESA can be canceled or suspended for up to a year.

===Use of money received through violations of the ESA===
A reward will be paid to any person who furnishes information which leads to an arrest, conviction, or revocation of a license, so long as they are not a local, state, or federal employee in the performance of official duties. The Secretary may ''also'' provide reasonable and necessary costs incurred for the care of fish, wildlife, and forest service or plant pending the violation caused by the criminal. If the balance ever exceeds $500,000 the Secretary of the Treasury is required to deposit an amount equal to the excess into the cooperative endangered species conservation fund.

The exact scope of centrism varies from the entire [[Western world]] to only [[Europe]] or even just [[Western Europe#Cold War|Western Europe]] (especially during the [[Cold War]]).

[[File:Samir Amin.jpg|thumb|''Eurocentrism'' as the term for an ideology was coined by [[Samir Amin]] in the 1970s]]
The adjective ''Eurocentric'', or ''Europe-centric'', has been in use, in various contexts, since at least the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;The German adjective ''europa-zentrisch'' ("Europe-centric") is attested in the 1920s, unrelated to the Marxist context of Amin's usage. [[Karl Haushofer]], ''Geopolitik des pazifischen Ozeans'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;11–23, 110-113, ''passim''). The context is Haushofer's comparison of the "Pacific space" in terms of global politics vs. "Europe-centric" politics.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was popularised (in French as ''européocentrique'') in the context of [[decolonization]] and [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] in the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;A Rey (ed.) ''Dictionnaire Historique de la langue française'' (2010): ''À partir du radical de ''européen ont été composés (mil. XXe s.) ''européocentrique'' adj. (de ''centrique'') « qui fait référence à l'Europe » et ''européocentrisme'' n.m. (variante ''europocentrisme'' n.m. 1974) « fait de considérer (un problème général, mondial) d'un point de vue européen » ."&lt;/ref&gt; English usage of ''Eurocentric''  as an [[ideological]] term in [[identity politics]] was current by the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;
Hussein Abdilahi Bulhan, ''Frantz Fanon and the Psychology of Oppression'' (1985), [https://books.google.com/books?id=z55WPkZpyoYC&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 63ff]: "Fanon and Eurocentric Psychology",  where "Eurocentric psychology" refers to "a psychology derived from a white, middle-class male minority, which is generalized to humanity everywhere".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[-ism|abstract noun]] ''Eurocentrism'' (French ''eurocentrisme'', earlier ''europocentrisme'') as the term for an ideology was coined in the 1970s by the Egyptian [[Marxian economist]] [[Samir Amin]], then director of the African Institute for Economic Development and Planning of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uneca.org/fr/pages/anciens-directeurs "Anciens directeurs" (uneca.org)] ("Samir AMIN (Egypte)  1970-1980").&lt;/ref&gt; Amin used the term in the context of a global, core-periphery or dependency model of [[capitalist]] development. English usage of ''Eurocentrism'' is recorded by 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre A. Bennigsen, S. Enders Wimbush

Use of Latinate ''occido-centrism'' remains rare (e.g. Alexander Lukin, ''Political Culture of the Russian 'Democrats' '' (2000), p. 47).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==European exceptionalism==
{{Further|Great Divergence|The European Miracle|Age of Discovery|Colonialism|Western world}}

During the [[European colonialism|European colonial era]], encyclopedias often sought to give a rationale for the predominance of European rule during the [[History of colonialism|colonial period]] by referring to a special position taken by Europe compared to the other continents.

Thus, [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]], in 1741, wrote that "even though Europe is the smallest of the [[Four continents|world's four continents]], it has for various reasons a position that places it before all others.... Its inhabitants have excellent customs, they are courteous and erudite in both sciences and crafts".&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{lang-de|Obwohl Europa das kleinste unter allen 4. Teilen der Welt ist, so ist es doch um verschiedener Ursachen willen allen übrigen vorzuziehen.... Die Einwohner sind von sehr guten Sitten, höflich und sinnreich in Wissenschaften und Handwerken.}}] [http://www.zedler-lexikon.de/blaettern/zedlerband.html?bandnummer=8&amp;seitenzahl=1127 "Europa". In: ''Zedlers Universal-Lexicon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911233435/http://www.zedler-lexikon.de/blaettern/zedlerband.html?bandnummer=8&amp;seitenzahl=1127 |date=11 September 2011 }}, Volume 8, Leipzig 1734, columns 2192–2196 (citation: column 2195).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Brockhaus Enzyklopädie]]'' (''Conversations-Lexicon'') of 1847 still has an ostensibly Eurocentric approach and claims about Europe that "its geographical situation and its cultural and political significance is clearly the most important of the five continents, over which it has gained a most influential government both in material and even more so in cultural aspects".&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{lang-de|[Europa ist seiner] terrestrischen Gliederung wie seiner kulturhistorischen und politischen Bedeutung nach unbedingt der wichtigste unter den fünf Erdtheilen, über die er in materieller, noch mehr aber in geistiger Beziehung eine höchst einflussreiche Oberherrschaft erlangt hat.}}] [https://books.google.com/books?id=fK9GAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA373&amp;lpg=PA373&amp;dq=terrestrischen+Gliederung+wie+seiner+kulturhistorischen+und+politischen+Bedeutung+nach+unbedingt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OHabGFZOHV&amp;sig=vzDSLN8olz9xNfMAgQ13d4-dRAg&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6bZkT_7KBY_VgAeW_ZzNAg&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=terrestrischen%20Gliederung%20wie%20seiner%20kulturhistorischen%20und%20politischen%20Bedeutung%20nach%20unbedingt&amp;f=false ''Das große Conversations-Lexicon für die gebildeten Stände''], 1847. Vol. 1, p. 373.&lt;/ref&gt;

European [[exceptionalism]] thus grew out of the [[Great Divergence]] of the [[Early Modern period]], 
due to the combined effects of  the [[Scientific Revolution]], the [[Commercial Revolution]], and the [[First European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|rise of colonial empires]], the  [[Industrial Revolution]] and a [[Second European colonization wave (19th century–20th century)|Second European colonization wave]].

European exceptionalism is widely reflected in  popular genres of literature, especially literature for young adults (for example, [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]])'' and adventure literature in general. Portrayal of European colonialism in such literature has been analysed in terms of Eurocentrism in retrospect, such as presenting idealised and often exaggeratedly masculine Western heroes, who conquered 'savage' peoples in the remaining 'dark spaces' of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Iwerks, "Ideology and Eurocentrism in ''Tarzan of the Apes''," in: ''Investigating the Unliterary: Six Readings of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan of the Apes'', ed. Richard Utz (Regensburg: Martzinek, 1995), pp. 69-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European miracle]], a term coined by Eric Jones in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the 15th to 18th centuries, a great divergence took place, comprising the European Renaissance, [[age of discovery]], the formation of the [[colonial empire]]s, the [[Age of Reason]], and the associated leap forward in [[technology]] and the development of [[capitalism]] and early [[industrialisation]]. The result was that by the 19th century, European powers dominated [[International trade|world trade]] and [[Global politics|world politics]].

Eurocentrism is a way of dominating the exchange of ideas to show the superiority of one perspective and how much power it holds over different social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Satya|first=Laxman D.|date=2005|editor-last=Blaut|editor-first=J.

==History of the concept==
===Anticolonialism===
Even in the 19th century, [[anticolonial movements]] had developed claims about national traditions and values that were set against those of Europe. In some cases, as China, where local ideology was even more exclusionist than the Eurocentric one, [[Westernisation]] did not overwhelm longstanding Chinese attitudes to its own cultural centrality, but some would state that idea itself is a rather desperate attempt to cast Europe in a good light by comparison.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cambridge History of China, CUP,1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Orientalism]] developed in the late 18th century as a disproportionate Western interest in and idealization of Eastern (i.e. Asian) cultures.

By the early 20th century, some historians, such as [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], were attempting to construct multifocal models of world civilizations. Toynbee also drew attention in Europe to non-European historians, such as the medieval Tunisian scholar [[Ibn Khaldun]]. He also established links with Asian thinkers, such as through his dialogues with [[Daisaku Ikeda]] of [[Soka Gakkai International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McNeill |first=William |year=1989 |title=Arnold J. Toynbee: A Life |location=New York and Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=272–73 |isbn=0-19-505863-1 |author-link=William H. McNeill (historian) |quote=From Toynbee's point of view, Soka Gakkai was exactly what his vision of the historical moment expected, for it was a new church, arising on the fringes of the 'post-Christian' world....  Convergence of East and West was, indeed, what Toynbee and Ikeda sought and thought they had found in their dialogue. In a preface, written in the third person, Toynbee emphasized and tried to explain this circumstance. 'They agree that a human being ought to be perpetually striving to overcome his innate propensity to try to exploit the rest of the universe and that he ought to be trying, instead, to put himself at the service of the universe so unreservedly that his ego will become identical with an ultimate reality, which for a Buddhist is the Buddha state. They agree in believing that this ultimate reality is not a humanlike divine personality.' He explained these and other agreements as reflecting the 'birth of a common worldwide civilization that has originated in a technological framework of Western origin but is now being enriched spiritually by contributions from all the historic regional civilizations.' ... [Ikeda's] dialogue with Toynbee is the longest and most serious text in which East and West—that is, Ikeda and a famous representative of the mission field that Ikeda sees before him—have agreed with each other. In the unlikely event that Soka Gakkai lives up to its leader's hopes and realizes Toynbee's expectations by flourishing in the Western world, this dialogue might, like the letters of St. Paul, achieve the status of sacred scripture and thus become by far the most important of all of Toynbee's works.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The explicit concept of Eurocentrism is a product of the period of [[decolonisation]] in the 1960s to 1970s. Its original context is the core-periphery or dependency model of [[capitalism|capitalist development]] of [[Marxian economics]] (Amin 1974, 1988).

===Debate since 1990s===
Eurocentrism has been a particularly important concept in [[development studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Brohman, John. "Universalism, Eurocentrism, and Ideological Bias in Development Studies: From Modernization to Neoliberalism". :'Third World Quarterly'' 16.1 (1995): 121-140.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Brohman (1995) argued that Eurocentrism "perpetuated intellectual dependence on a restricted group of prestigious Western academic institutions that determine the subject matter and methods of research".&lt;ref&gt;Brohman, John. "Universalism, Eurocentrism, and Ideological Bias in Development Studies: From Modernization to Neoliberalism". ''Third World Quarterly'' 16.1 (1995): 121-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

In treatises on historical or contemporary Eurocentrism that appeared since the 1990s, Eurocentrism is mostly cast in terms of dualisms such as 
civilized/barbaric or advanced/backward, developed/undeveloped, core/periphery, implying "evolutionary schemas through which societies inevitably progress", with a remnant of an "underlying presumption of a superior white Western self as referent of analysis" (640{{clarify|date=May 2014}}).&lt;ref&gt;Sundberg, Juanita. "Eurocentrism". International Encyclopedia of Human Geography (2009): 638-643.&lt;/ref&gt; Eurocentrism and the dualistic properties that it labels on non-European countries, cultures and persons have often been criticized in the political discourse of the 1990s and 2000s, particularly in the greater context of [[political correctness]], [[race in the United States]] and [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;Green, John. Crashcourse "Eurocentrism" (2012):&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loewen, James "lies My teacher told me"(1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1990s, there was a trend of criticizing various geographic terms current in the English language as Eurocentric, such as 
the traditional [[Boundaries between continents|division of Eurasia]] into Europe and Asia&lt;ref&gt;Martin Lewis and [[Kären Wigen]] in their book, ''The Myth of Continents'' (1997):
"In physical, cultural and historical diversity, China and [[India]] are comparable to the entire European landmass, not to a single European country. A better (if still imperfect) analogy would compare [[France]], not to India as a whole, but to a single Indian state, such as [[Uttar Pradesh]]." {{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Martin W. |authorlink= |author2=Kären E.

{{cite web | last =Hanafi | first = Hassan |title=The Middle East, in whose world?

An updated and edited version has been published in Utvik and Vikør, The Middle East in a Globalized World, Bergen/London 2000, 1-9. Please quote or refer only to the published article") "The expression Middle East is an old British label based on a British Western perception of the East divided into middle or near and far".&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Eric Sheppard]], in 2005, argued that contemporary [[Marxism]] itself  has Eurocentric traits (in spite of "Eurocentrism" originating in the vocabulary of Marxian economics), because  it supposes that the [[third world]] must go through a stage of capitalism before "progressive social formations can be envisioned".&lt;ref&gt;Sheppard, Eric". [[James Morris Blaut|Jim Blaut]]'s Model of The World". Antipode 37.5 (2005): 956-962.&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some debate on whether historical Eurocentrism qualifies as "just another ethnocentrism", as it is found in most of the world's cultures, especially in cultures with imperial aspirations, as in the [[Sinocentrism]] in China; in the [[Empire of Japan]] (c. 1868-1945), or during the [[American Century]]. [[James M. Blaut]] (2000) argued that Eurocentrism indeed army beyond other ethnocentrisms, as the scale of European colonial expansion was historically unprecedented and resulted in the formation of a "colonizer's model of the world".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Morris Blaut|Blaut, James M.]] (2000), ''Eight Eurocentric Historians'', Guilford Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race and politics in the United States===
{{Main|Race and ethnicity in the United States|Racism in the United States}}
The terms [[Afrocentrism]] vs. Eurocentrism have come to play a role in the 2000s to 2010s in the context of the political discourse on [[race in the United States]] and [[critical whiteness studies]], aiming to expose [[white supremacism]] and [[white privilege]].&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Alison Bailey, "Philosophy and Whiteness" in Tim Engles (ed.) ''Towards a Bibliography of Critical Whiteness Studies''  Center on Democracy in a Multiracial Society (2006), p. 9.:
	 
"Philosophical methods are well suited for unpacking the political, ontological, and epistemological conditions that foster racism and hold white supremacy in place. However, on the whole, philosophy as a discipline has remained relatively untouched by interdisciplinary work on race and whiteness. In its quest for certainty, Western philosophy continues to generate what it imagines to be colorless and genderless accounts of knowledge, reality, morality, and human nature".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Afrocentrist]] scholars, such as [[Molefi Asante]], have argued that there is a prevalence of Eurocentric thought in the processing of much of academia on African affairs. On the other hand, in an article, 'Eurocentrism and Academic Imperialism' by Professor [[Seyed Mohammad Marandi]], from the [[University of Tehran]], states that Eurocentric thought exists in almost all aspects of academia in many parts of the world, especially in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zarcommedia.com/index.php/research-documents/6691.html |title=Eurocentrism and Academic Imperialism |publisher=ZarCom Media |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2015-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgar Alfred Bowring]] states that in the West, self-regard, self-congratulation and denigration of the ‘Other’ run more deeply and those tendencies have infected more aspects of their thinking, laws and policy than anywhere else.&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Eze, Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader (Blackwell, 1997); M. Shahid Alam, “Articulating Group Differences: A Variety of Autocentrisms,” Science and Society (Summer 2003): 206-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Luke Clossey and Nicholas Guyatt have measured the degree of Eurocentrism in the research programs of top history departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallworldhistory.org |title=It's a Small World After All |last1=Clossey |first1=Luke |last2=Guyatt |first2=Nicholas |date=2013 |website=Small World History |publisher=Simon Fraser University |access-date=24 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Southern Europe]] and [[Latin America]], a number of academic proposals to offer alternatives to the Eurocentric perspective have emerged, such as the project of the [[Epistemologies of the South]] by Portuguese scholar [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]] and those of the [[Subaltern Studies]] groups in [[India]] and Latin America (the [[Modernity/Coloniality Group]] of [[Anibal Quijano]], [[Edgardo Lander]], [[Enrique Dussel]], [[Santiago Castro-Gómez]], [[Ramón Grosfoguel]], and others.

== Georg Hegel ==
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770-1831) was the leading supporter of Eurocentrism, believing that world history started in the East but ended in the West, especially in Prussia's constitutional monarchy. His real interest in history was in Europe and Oriental culture was only one episode of world history to him. In ''Lectures on the Philosophy of History'', he claimed that world history started in Asia but shifted to Greece and Italy, and then north of the [[Alps]] to France, Germany and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Boer|first=Karin|date=2017-06-06|title=Hegel’s Lectures on the History of Modern Philosophy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.29|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199355228.013.29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=CuliwYNyvSUC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=center+o+Europe+hegel&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTvu71j-veAhXKB8AKHbeIDuoQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=center%20o%20Europe%20hegel&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hegel, India and China are stationary countries which lack inner momentum. China replaced the real historically development with a fixed, stable scenario, which makes it the outsider of world history. Both India and China were waiting and anticipating a combination of certain factors from outside until they can acquire real progress in human civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farmer|first=Edward L.|date=1985|title=Civilization as a Unit of World History: Eurasia and Europe's Place in It|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/493055|journal=The History Teacher|volume=18|issue=3|pages=345–363|doi=10.2307/493055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's ideas had a profound impact on western history.

== Max Weber ==
[[Max Weber]] (1864-1920) was considered as the most ardent supporter of Eurocentrism, and he suggested that capitalism is the specialty of Europe and Oriental countries such as India and China do not contain sufficient factors to develop capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/220409196|title=Scholarship and partisanship : essays on Max Weber|last=1916-|first=Bendix, Reinhard,|date=1980|publisher=University of California Press|others=Roth, Guenther.|isbn=0520041712|edition= California Library reprint series |location=Berkeley|oclc=220409196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber wrote many treatises to publicize the distinctiveness of Europe.

Weber regarded rationality as a proprietary article for western capitalist society.

== Andre Gunder Frank ==
[[Andre Gunder Frank]] harshly criticized Eurocentrism. He believed that most scholars were the desciples of the social sciences and history guided by Eurocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Payne|first=Anthony|title=Unequal Development|date=2005|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-05592-7_9|work=The Global Politics of Unequal Development|pages=231–247|publisher=Macmillan Education UK|isbn=9780333740729|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized some western scholars for their ideas that non-west areas lack outstanding contributions in history, economy, ideology, politics and culture compared with the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42922426|title=ReOrient : global economy in the Asian Age|last=1929-2005.|first=Frank, Andre Gunder,|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520921313|location=Berkeley|oclc=42922426}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars believed that the same contribution made by the west gives westerners an advantage of endo-genetic momentum which is pushed towards the rest of the world, but Frank believed that the Oriental countries also contributed to the human civilization in their own perspectives.

== Arnold Toynbee ==
[[Arnold J. Toynbee|Arnold Toynbee]] (1889-1975) argued that the unit for historical research is the society instead of the state. There are over 20 civilizations in the world history. In his ''A Study of History'', he gave a critical remark on Eurocentrism. He believed that although western capitalism shrouded the world and achieved a political unity based on its economy, the western countries cannot "westernize" other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16276526|title=A study of history|last=1889-1975.|first=Toynbee, Arnold,|date=1987, ©1957|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Somervell, D.

== Eurocentrism in the beauty industry==
Eurocentrism has affected the beauty realm globally. The beauty standard has become westernized and has influenced people throughout the globe. Many have altered their natural self to reflect this image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/118736/ads-around-the-world-illustrate-a-surprising-problem-with-beauty-standards?utm_campaign=social&amp;utm_medium=main&amp;utm_source=policymicTBLR#.c8TY9LlbO|title=Here's the Disastrous Effect of American Beauty Ideals in Ads Around the World|last=Zellinger|first=Julie|date=|work=MIC|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many beauty and advertising companies have redirected their products to support this idea of Eurocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thevarsity.ca/2017/03/05/for-many-south-koreans-beauty-standards-represent-a-cultural-struggle/|title=For many South Koreans, beauty standards represent a cultural struggle|date=2017-03-06|work=The Varsity|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clark doll experiment ===
{{See also|Kenneth and Mamie Clark#Doll experiments}}
In the 1940s, psychologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark held experiments called “the doll tests” to examine the psychological effects of segregation on African-American children. They tested children by presenting them four dolls, identical but different skin tone. They had to choose which doll they preferred and were asked the race of the doll. Most of the children chose the white doll. The Clark's stated in their results that the perception of the African-American children were altered by the discrimination they faced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naacpldf.org/brown-at-60-the-doll-test|title=Brown at 60: The Doll Test {{!}} NAACP LDF|website=www.naacpldf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tested children also labeled positive descriptions to the white dolls. One of the criticisms of this test is presented by Robin Bernstein, a professor of African and African American studies and women, gender, and sexuality. His argument is that "Clark's child subjects by offering a new understanding of them not as psychologically damaged dupes, but instead as agential experts in children’s culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2011/12/1/clark-dolls-research-media/|title=Professor Revisits Clark Doll Tests  {{!}} News {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|last=|first=|date=|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mexican doll experiment ===
In 2012, Mexicans recreated the doll test. Mexico’s [[National Council to Prevent Discrimination]] presented a video where children had to pick  the “good doll,” and the doll that looks like them. By doing this experiment, the researchers wanted to analyze the degree to which Mexican children are influenced modern day media accessible to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thegrio.com/2012/01/06/mexicans-recreate-black-doll-white-doll-experiment-to-measure-skin-color-preference-south-of-the-bor/|title=Mexicans recreate 'black doll-white doll' experiment to measure skin color preference south of the border - theGrio|date=2012-01-06|work=theGrio|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the children chose was the white doll because it was better. They also stated that it looked like them. The people who carried out the study noted that Euro centrism is deeply rooted in different cultures, including Latin cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rollingout.com/2012/01/03/mexicans-recreate-black-doll-white-doll-experiment-to-measure-skin-color-preference-south-of-the-border/|title=Mexicans Recreate ‘Black Doll-White Doll’ Experiment to Measure Skin Color Preference South of the Border|website=rollingout.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was back lash from this experiment because the children did not have more options other than the two dolls ( black and white). The children were half-Spanish and half-Indian descent.

=== Beauty advertisements ===
Advertisements shown throughout the world are Eurocentric and emphasize western characteristics. Caucasian models are the number one models to be hired by popular, global brands like Estee Lauder and L’Oreal. Local models in the region in Korea, Hong Kong and Japan barely made it to global brands’ ads, compared to Caucasian models who appear in  forty-four percent of Korean and fifty-four percent of Japanese ads. By demonstrating these ads, they are emphasizing that the ideal skin is  bright, transparent, white, full, and fine. On the other hand, dark skin is looked down upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=P.H.|first=Li, Eric|last2=Jeong|first2=Min, Hyun|last3=W.|first3=Belk, Russell|date=2008|title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures|url=http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/13415/volumes/v35/NA-35|journal=ACR North American Advances|language=en|volume=NA-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is skin color desired by these models, but also their physical frame, hair, and facial features.

=== Skin lightening ===
[[Skin whitening|Skin lightening]] has become a common practice throughout different areas of the globe in order to fit the Eurocentric beauty standard. Many women risk their health in order to use these products and obtain the tone they desire. A study conducted by Dr Lamine Cissé observed the female population in some African countries. They found that 26%  of women were using skin lightening creams at the time and 36% had used them at some time. The common products used were hydroquinone and corticosteroids. 75% of women who used these creams showed cutaneous adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=del Giudice|first=Pascal|last2=Yves|first2=Pinier|date=2002-02|title=The widespread use of skin lightening creams in Senegal: a persistent public health problem in West Africa|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1046/j.1365-4362.2002.01335.x|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|language=en|volume=41|issue=2|pages=69–72|doi=10.1046/j.1365-4362.2002.01335.x|issn=0011-9059}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitening products have also become popular in many areas in Asia like South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thevarsity.ca/2017/03/05/for-many-south-koreans-beauty-standards-represent-a-cultural-struggle/|title=For many South Koreans, beauty standards represent a cultural struggle|last=Eugene|first=Carol|date=2017-03-06|work=The Varsity|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of these products, research has been done to study the long term damage. Some complications experienced are exogenous ochronosis, impaired wound healing and wound dehiscence, the fish odor syndrome, nephropathy, steroid addiction syndrome, predisposition to infections, a broad spectrum of cutaneous and endocrinologic complications of corticosteroids, and suppression of hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olumide|first=Yetunde M.|last2=Akinkugbe|first2=Ayesha O.|last3=Altraide|first3=Dan|last4=Mohammed|first4=Tahir|last5=Ahamefule|first5=Ngozi|last6=Ayanlowo|first6=Shola|last7=Onyekonwu|first7=Chinwe|last8=Essen|first8=Nyomudim|date=2008|title=Complications of chronic use of skin lightening cosmetics|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showCitFormats?doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.02719.x|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|language=en|volume=47|issue=4|pages=344–353|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.02719.x|issn=0011-9059|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all these health effects it can cause, many will not give up their products.

=== South Korea ===
South Korea has been influenced by the Western beauty standard. In order to achieve a more western look, some South Koreans turn to plastic surgery to obtain those features. According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, South Korea has the highest rates of plastic surgery procedures per capita. The most asked for procedures are the blepharoplasty and rhinoplasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thevarsity.ca/2017/03/05/for-many-south-koreans-beauty-standards-represent-a-cultural-struggle/|title=For many South Koreans, beauty standards represent a cultural struggle|last=Euegene|first=Carol|date=2017-03-06|work=The Varsity|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another procedure done in Korea is having the muscle under the tongue that connects to the bottom of the mouth surgically snipped. Parents have their children to undergo this surgery in order to pronounce English better.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/asiapcf/05/19/korea.beauty/index.html|title=Plastic surgery boom as Asians seek 'western' look|last=CNN|first=By  Kyung Lah,|access-date=2018-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, cosmetic eyelid surgery is considered to be normal. Korea has close and modern ties with the U.S. which allows constant interaction with the Western culture. In order to fit in they undergo these lengths to become more westernized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/305027932|title=The moving eye: From Cold War racial subject to middle class cosmopolitan, Korean cosmetic eyelid surgery, 1955–2001 - ProQuest|last=taeyon|first=Kim|date=|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies in South Korea have focused on more race-driven beauty and have made more skin lightening products, hair straightening products and even affordable eyelid surgeries.

The '''European Youth Parliament''' is a politically unbound [[non-profit organisation]], which encourages [[Europe]]an youth to actively engage in citizenship and cultural understanding.
It involves 50,000 youngsters from all around [[Europe]] in its events and has around 5,000 active members in the different countries. It was established in 1987 in [[Fontainebleau]], [[France]].

== History ==

The European Youth Parliament was founded by Bettina Carr-Allinson, initially as a school project at the [[Lycée]] François-Ier in [[Fontainebleau]], to the south of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsterdam2012.eu/introduction/ |title=Introduction &amp;#124; Amsterdam 2012 - European Youth Parliament (EYP) |publisher=Amsterdam2012.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is there that three of the first four International Sessions were held, starting in 1988, about a year after the idea took place.

It then developed steadily for a few years until it moved to [[Witney]], [[Oxfordshire]], in 1991, and was legally recognised as the ''European Youth Parliament International Ltd.'', a [[subsidiary]] of a [[Charitable organization|charity]] created in 1992 for this purpose, the [[Fontainebleau Youth Foundation]]. 
The organisation experienced an enduring growth for the next ten years, its network counting an increasing number of National Committees and its activities becoming both larger and more numerous. The National Committees stretch beyond the scope of countries within the European Union and try to encompass all European countries.

In the years 2001 to 2004, the EYP encountered various problems of financial nature.
On November 4, 2004, however, the European Youth Parliament was reborn due to a mutual agreement between representatives of EYP's Board of National Committees, alumni and the [[Heinz-Schwarzkopf Foundation]]. The EYP's status since then has been a programme of the [[Schwarzkopf-Stiftung Junges Europa]], and is hosted in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]].

The actual activities of the EYP never faltered during this period.

Since 2004, the EYP has introduced several reforms to introduce more transparency in its institutions and further enlarged its activities.

== Management ==
At the international level, the EYP is governed by an international board, the [[Board of governors|Governing Body]]. The Governing Body has six members elected by the National Committees and by the alumni of past sessions. A representative of the Heinz-Schwarzkopf Foundation is also a member. 
The board is largely responsible for the quality assurance of the International Sessions but also takes responsibility for the overall direction of the organisation and the long-term sustainability and protection of the organisation. 
The day-to-day business of the organisation is administered by a [[hired]] [[Management|manager]] at the International Office in Berlin. [[Philipp J. Scharff]] was the manager from 2004 until 2008, Jan Phillip Beck (DE) from 2008 until 2011 and Ville Vasaramäki (FI) from 2011 until 2013. Krista Lagus (FI) has been the Executive Director of the EYP since 2013. Since 30 January 2017, Krista Lagus is on maternity leave. Lukas Fendel (DE) is taking on the role of Executive Director for the time of her leave.

At the national level, the National Committees are free to choose how to manage themselves, though the form of management must comply with basic democratic principles. It is the responsibility of the National Committees to organise and fund their own national sessions (more about them below). International Sessions can receive limited funding from EYP at the international level but are largely responsible for their economy as well. Sessions are usually funded through sponsorship from various organisations or corporations. Each session must be economically independent.

== Sessions ==
EYP organises three international nine-day sessions each year. They are organised in different countries and all European countries are invited to join, not just members of the [[European Union|EU]]. Each country's national committee selects a delegation to participate in each session, the size of the delegation depends on the country and how long time its National Committee has been part of EYP. The delegations are then spread out in different committees, each committee with a particular topic. This ensures a maximised cultural diversity in the committee and serves as a strong incentive to socialise and make friends with people from the committee.

Each international session starts with of a two-day Teambuilding part, in which delegates get acquainted with each other and start improving the group dynamics of the committee. The delegates play different games which are meant to bring the delegates from an initial shyness stage to a comfortable, open atmosphere optimal for efficient Committee work.

This is followed by four or five days for Committee Work. During this time the delegates discuss a problematic topic on current European political matters and write a resolution on how to deal with the issue. A member of the European Parliament or some alternative expert will generally visit once to answer questions and quickly discuss the topic with the Committee.

The sessions end with a General Assembly, in which the committee resolutions are looked through, altered and approved (or if the resolution is found unacceptable, not approved). If a resolution is approved it is sent on to the European Parliament, for the consideration of MEPs. General Assembly is usually held in some honorary or prestigious location, such as the host country's Houses of Parliament or the main hall of the City Council.

Additionally [[#National Committees|National Committees]] of EYP organise several national and regional sessions every year. National sessions are to select a delegation for one of the upcoming international sessions. These sessions are shorter, lasting normally three days and do not invite a member of the European Parliament to the committees. 
Regional sessions are of varying length, from 3 to 7 or 8 days, and in essence imitate international sessions. They have, however, a more constrained budget and tend to be less formal than international sessions. 
For both national and regional sessions, resolutions are not sent on to the European Parliament.

As of Autumn 2018, 89 (taking into account the Extraordinary International Session of EYP in Lillehammer, Norway, Winter 2010) international EYP sessions have taken place:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyp.org/page.1.661.List-of-International-Sessions.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504223218/http://www.eyp.org/page.1.661.List-of-International-Sessions.html |date=May 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frontage''' is the boundary between a plot of land or a building and the road onto which the plot or building fronts. Frontage may also refer to the full length of this boundary. This length is considered especially important for certain types of commercial and retail real estate, in applying zoning bylaws and property tax.  In the case of contiguous buildings individual frontages are usually measured to the middle of any party wall.  

In some parts of the United States, particularly [[New England]], a [[frontage road]] is one which runs parallel to a major road or highway, and is intended primarily for local access to and egress from those properties which line it.

A ''river frontage'' or ''ocean frontage'' is the length of a plot of land that faces directly onto a river or ocean respectively. The amount of such frontage may affect the value of the plot.

''[http://www.shepheard-walwyn.co.uk/product/the-corruption-of-economics/ The Corruption of Economics]''. London: Shepheard-Walwyn. {{ISBN|978-0-85683-244-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Michael; Feder, Kris; and Miller, George James (1994).

Georgism is concerned with the distribution of [[economic rent]] caused by [[natural monopolies]], [[pollution]], and the control of [[commons]], including [[Title (property)|title]] of ownership for [[natural resources]] and other contrived [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]] (e.g., [[intellectual property]]). Any natural resource which is inherently limited in [[Supply (economics)|supply]] can generate [[economic rent]], but the classical and most significant example of 'land monopoly' involves the extraction of common [[ground rent]] from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is [[Economic efficiency|efficient]], [[Justice|fair]], and [[Equity (economics)|equitable]]. The main Georgist policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value. Georgists argue that revenues from a [[land value tax]] (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing taxes (for example, on [[income tax|income]], [[Tariff|trade]], or [[sales tax|purchases]]) that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue back to the people by means of a [[basic income]] or [[citizen's dividend]].

Economists since [[Adam Smith]] and David Ricardo have observed that, unlike other taxes, a public levy on land value does not cause [[deadweight loss|economic inefficiency]].&lt;ref name="Adam Smith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Adam |title=The Wealth of Nations, Book V |date=1776 |chapter=Chapter 2, Article 1: Taxes upon the Rent of Houses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TidemanEngland1994"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Nicolaus |last1=Tideman |first2=Mason |last2=Gaffney|title=Land and Taxation |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=s0wgAQAAIAAJ}}|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Shepheard-Walwyn in association with Centre for Incentive Taxation|isbn=978-0-85683-162-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A land value tax also has [[progressive tax]] effects, in that it is paid primarily by the wealthy (the landowners), and it cannot be passed on to tenants, workers, or users of land.&lt;ref name="World Bank"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Binswanger-Mkhize, Hans P |author2=Bourguignon, Camille |author3=Brink, Rogier van den |title=Agricultural Land Redistribution : Toward Greater Consensus |date=2009 |publisher=World Bank |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2653 |quote=A land tax is considered a progressive tax in that wealthy landowners normally should be paying relatively more than poorer landowners and tenants.

[[Henry George]] is best known for popularizing the argument that government should be funded by a [[land value tax|tax on land rent]] rather than [[Payroll tax|taxes on labor]]. George believed that although [[scientific experiment]]s could not be performed in political economy, theories could be tested by comparing different societies with different conditions and by [[thought experiments]] about the effects of various factors.&lt;ref name="henrygeorge.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp0.htm|title=Progress and Poverty, Introduction|website=www.henrygeorge.org|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying this method, he concluded that many of the problems that beset society, such as poverty, inequality, and economic booms and busts, could be attributed to the private ownership of the necessary resource, land. In his most celebrated book, ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'', George argues that the appropriation of land for private use contributes to persistent poverty in spite of technological progress, and causes economies to exhibit a tendency toward boom and bust cycles. According to George, people justly own what they create, but that natural opportunities and [[land (economics)|land]] belong equally to all.&lt;ref name=Heavey /&gt;
{{quote|The tax upon land values is, therefore, the most just and equal of all taxes. It falls only upon those who receive from society a peculiar and valuable benefit, and upon them in proportion to the benefit they receive. It is the taking by the community, for the use of the community, of that value which is the creation of the community. It is the application of the common property to common uses. When all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community, then will the equality ordained by Nature be attained. No citizen will have an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by his industry, skill, and intelligence; and each will obtain what he fairly earns. Then, but not till then, will labor get its full reward, and capital its natural return.|author=Henry George |source=''Progress and Poverty'', Book VIII, Chapter 3}}

George believed there was an important distinction between common and collective property.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geolib.com/sullivan.dan/commonrights.html|title=Common Rights Vs. Collective Rights|website=geolib.com|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although equal rights to land might be achieved by nationalizing land and then leasing it to private users, George preferred taxing [[land value tax|unimproved land value]] and leaving the control of land mostly in private hands. George's reasoning for leaving land in private control and slowly shifting to land value tax was that it would not penalize existing owners who had improved land and would also be less disruptive and controversial in a country where land titles have already been granted.

Georgists have observed that privately created wealth is socialized via the tax system (e.g., through income and sales tax), while socially created wealth in land values are privatized in the price of land titles and bank mortgages. The opposite would be the case if land rents replaced taxes on labor as the main source of public revenue; socially created wealth would become available for use by the community, while the fruits of labor would remain private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthsharing.ca/page/poverty|title=Poverty - Earthsharing Canada|website=earthsharing.ca|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Georgists, a land value tax can be considered a user fee instead of a tax, since it is related to the market value of socially created locational advantage, the privilege to exclude others from locations.

{{Economics sidebar}}

Standard [[economics|economic]] theory suggests that a land value tax would be extremely efficient – unlike other taxes, it does not reduce economic productivity.&lt;ref name="McCluskey and Franzsen" /&gt; [[Milton Friedman]] described Henry George's tax on unimproved value of land as the "least bad tax", since unlike other taxes, it would not impose an excess burden on economic activity (leading to zero or even negative "[[deadweight loss]]"); hence, a replacement of other more distortionary taxes with a land value tax would improve economic welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Foldvary, Fred E. "Geo-Rent: A Plea to Public Economists". ''Econ Journal Watch'' (April 2005)[http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-2-issue-1-april-2005]&lt;/ref&gt; As land value tax can improve the use of land and redirect investment toward productive, non-rentseeking activities, it could even have a negative deadweight loss that boosts productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stiglitz |first1=Joseph |title=Thomas Piketty and Joseph Stiglitz |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg6UwAQJUVo?t=7948 |publisher=INETeconomics |accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because land value tax would apply to foreign land speculators, the Australian Treasury estimated that land value tax was unique in having a negative marginal excess burden, meaning that it would increase long-run living standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Re:Think.

It was Adam Smith who first noted the efficiency and distributional properties of a land value tax in his book, ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'':&lt;ref name="Adam Smith" /&gt;
{{quote|Ground-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses. A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of his ground. More or less can be got for it according as the competitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their fancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expense. In every country the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital, and it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be found. As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be disposed to pay more for the use of the ground. Whether the tax was to be advanced by the inhabitant, or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance. The more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the less he would incline to pay for the ground; so that the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent.

Both ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are a species of revenue which the owner, in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of this revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of the state, no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of industry. The annual produce of the land and labour of the society, the real wealth and revenue of the great body of the people, might be the same after such a tax as before. Ground-rents and the ordinary rent of land are, therefore, perhaps, the species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them. ... Nothing can be more reasonable than that a fund which owes its existence to the good government of the state should be taxed peculiarly, or should contribute something more than the greater part of other funds, towards the support of that government.}}

[[Ben Franklin|Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Winston Churchill]] made similar distributional and efficient arguments for taxing land rents. They noted that the costs of taxes and the benefits of public spending always eventually apply to and enrich, respectively, the owners of land. Therefore, they believed it would be best to defray public costs and recapture value of public spending by applying public charges directly to owners of land titles, rather than harming public welfare with taxes assessed against beneficial activities such as trade and labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Franklin |first1=Benjamin |title=Memoirs of Benjamin Franklin, Volume 2 |date=1840 |publisher=McCarty &amp; Davis |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HptPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA32 |accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shine |first1=Mary L. |title=Ideas of the founders of the American nation on landed property |date=1922 |publisher=University of Wisconsin |page=196 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iiNSAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry George wrote that his plan for a high land value tax would cause people "to contribute to the public, not in proportion to what they produce ... but in proportion to the value of natural [common] opportunities that they hold [monopolize]". He went on to explain that "by taking for public use that value which attaches to land by reason of the growth and improvement of the community", it would, "make the holding of land unprofitable to the mere owner, and profitable only to the user".

A high land value tax would discourage speculators from holding valuable natural opportunities (like urban real estate) unused or only partially used. Henry George claimed this would have many benefits, including the reduction or elimination of tax burdens from poorer neighborhoods and agricultural districts; the elimination of a multiplicity of taxes and expensive obsolete government institutions; the elimination of corruption, fraud, and evasion with respect to the collection of taxes; the enablement of true free trade; the destruction of monopolies; the elevation of wages to the full value of labor; the transformation of labor saving inventions into blessings for all; and the equitable distribution of comfort, leisure, and other advantages that are made possible by an advancing civilization.&lt;ref name="George 1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=George |first=Henry |title=An anthology of Henry George's thought |publisher=University of Rochester Press |location=Rochester, N.Y. |year=1997 |isbn=978-1878822819}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the vulnerability that market economies have to [[Economic bubble|credit bubbles]] and property manias would be reduced.&lt;ref name="McCluskey and Franzsen" /&gt;

===Sources of economic rent and related policy interventions===
{{See also|Pigovian tax|Severance tax}}

Income flow resulting from payments for restricted access to natural opportunities or for contrived privileges over geographic regions is termed [[economic rent]]. Georgists argue that economic rent of land, legal [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privileges]], and [[natural monopolies]] should accrue to the community, rather than private owners. In economics, "[[land (economics)|land]]" is everything that exists in nature independent of human activity. George explicitly included climate, soil, waterways, mineral deposits, laws/forces of nature, public ways, forests, oceans, air, and solar energy in the category of land.&lt;ref&gt;George, Henry (1905). ''Protection or Free Trade''&lt;/ref&gt; While the philosophy of Georgism does not say anything definitive about specific policy interventions needed to address problems posed by various sources of economic rent, the common goal among modern Georgists is to capture and share (or reduce) rent from all sources of natural monopoly and legal privilege.&lt;ref name="politicaleconomy.org"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Davies |first1=Lindy |title=The Science of Political Economy: What George "Left Out" |url=http://www.politicaleconomy.org/leftout.htm |website=Economic Science Course by the Henry George Institute |accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wealthandwant.com"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Batt |first1=H.

Henry George shared the goal of modern Georgists to socialize or dismantle rent from all forms of land monopoly and legal privilege. However, George emphasized mainly his preferred policy known as [[land value tax]], which targeted a particular form of unearned income known as [[ground rent]]. George emphasized ground-rent because basic locations were more valuable than other monopolies and everybody needed locations to survive, which he contrasted with the less significant streetcar and telegraph monopolies, which George also criticized. George likened the problem to a laborer traveling home who is waylaid by a series of highway robbers along the way, each who demand a small portion of the traveler's wages, and finally at the very end of the road waits a robber who demands all that the traveler has left. George reasoned that it made little difference to challenge the series of small robbers when the final robber remained to demand all that the common laborer had left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=George |first1=Henry |title=Protection or Free Trade |date=1886 |publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. |location=New York |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; George predicted that over time technological advancements would increase the frequency and importance of lesser monopolies, yet he expected that ground rent would remain dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=George |first1=Henry |title=An Anthology of Henry George's Thought, Volume 1 |date=1997 |publisher=University Rochester Press |page=148 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YcE19ylnJ8YC |accessdate=16 June 2014|isbn=9781878822819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; George even predicted that ground-rents would rise faster than wages and income to capital, a prediction that modern analysis has shown to be plausible, since the supply of land is fixed.&lt;ref name="econstor.eu"&gt;Mattauch, Linus; Siegmeier, Jan; Edenhofer, Ottmar; Creutzig, Felix (2013) : Financing Public Capital through Land Rent Taxation: A Macroeconomic Henry George Theorem, CESifo Working Paper, No. 4280 http://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/77659/1/cesifo_wp4280.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Common ground rent is still the primary emphasis of Georgists because of its large value and the known diseconomies of misused land. However, there are other sources of rent that are theoretically analogous to ground-rent and are debated topics of Georgists.

Pollution degrades the value of what Georgists consider to be [[commons]]. Because pollution is a negative contribution, a taking from the commons or a cost imposed on others, its value is [[economic rent]], even when the polluter is not receiving an explicit income. Therefore, to the extent that society determines pollution to be harmful, most Georgists propose to limit pollution with taxation or quotas that capture the resulting rents for public use, restoration, or a ''citizen's dividend''.&lt;ref name="politicaleconomy.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ikerd |first1=John |title=The Green Tax Shift: Winners and Losers |url=http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/Kansas%20City%20--%20George%20-%20Green%20Tax.htm |website=missouri.edu |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casal |first1=Paula |title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources |journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy |date=2011 |issue=8 |pages=307–27 |url=http://www.unipa.it/dottoratodirittocomparato/sites/default/files/20052009/Materiale%20Casal(2).pdf |accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgism is related to the school of [[ecological economics]], since both propose market based restrictions for pollution.&lt;ref name="Daly, Herman E. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Backhaus, Jurgen, and J. J. Krabbe. "Henry George's Contribution to Modern Environmental Policy: Part I, Theoretical Postulates." American Journal of Economics and Sociology 50.4 (1991): 485-501. Weborn 14 Aug. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The schools are compatible in that they advocate using similar tools as part of a conservation strategy, but they emphasize different aspects. Conservation is the central issue of ecology, whereas economic rent is the central issue of geoism. Ecological economists might price pollution fines more [[Conservation (ethic)|conservatively]] to prevent inherently unquantifiable damage to the environment, whereas Georgists might emphasize mediation between conflicting interests and human rights.&lt;ref name="wealthandwant.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cobb |first1=Clifford |title=Herman Daly Festschrift: Ecological and Georgist Economic Principles: A Comparison |url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/153482/ |accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geolibertarianism]], a market oriented branch of geoism, tends to take a direct stance against what it perceives as burdensome regulation and would like to see auctioned pollution quotas or taxes replace most [[command and control regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Roark |first1=Eric |title=Removing the Commons: A Lockean Left-Libertarian Approach to the Just Use and Appropriation of Natural Resources |date=2013 |publisher=Lexington Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QSaAAAAQBAJ |accessdate=12 June 2014|isbn=9780739174692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ecologists are primarily concerned with conservation, they tend to emphasize less the issue of equitably distributing [[economic rents|scarcity/pollution rents]], whereas Georgists insist that unearned income not accrue to those who hold title to natural assets and pollution privilege. To the extent that geoists recognize the effect of pollution or share conservationist values, they will agree with ecological economists about the need to limit pollution, but geoists will also insist that [[economic rent|pollution rents]] generated from those conservation efforts do not accrue to polluters and are instead used for public purposes or to compensate those who suffer the negative effects of pollution. Ecological economists advocate similar pollution restrictions but, emphasizing conservation first, might be willing to grant private polluters the privilege to capture pollution rents. To the extent that ecological economists share the geoist view of social justice, they would advocate auctioning pollution quotas instead of giving them away for free.&lt;ref name="Daly, Herman E. 2004" /&gt; This distinction can be seen in the difference between basic [[cap and trade]] and the geoist variation, [[cap and share]], a proposal to auction temporary pollution permits, with rents going to the public, instead of giving pollution privilege away for free to existing polluters or selling perpetual permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brebbia |first1=C.

===Revenue uses===

The revenue can allow the reduction or elimination of taxes, greater public investment/spending, or the direct distribution of funds to citizens as a pension or [[basic income]]/[[citizen's dividend]].&lt;ref name="wealthandwant.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hartzok |first1=Alanna |title=Citizen Dividends and Oil Resource Rents A Focus on Alaska, Norway and Nigeria |url=http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Hartzok_citdivs_oil.html |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gaffney |first1=Mason |title=A Cannan Hits the Mark |url=http://economics.ucr.edu/papers/papers02/02-17.pdf |accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the elimination of all other taxes implies a very great land value tax, greater than any currently existing land tax. Introducing a land value tax greater than the value of existing taxes would, at an uncertain point, inevitably cause the price of all land titles to decrease. George did not believe landowners should be compensated, and described the issue as being analogous to compensation for former slave owners. Other geoists disagree on the question of compensation; some advocate complete compensation while others endorse only enough compensation required to achieve Georgist reforms. Geoists have also long differed from George as to the degree of rent capture needed. Historically, those who advocated for public rent tax only great enough to replace other taxes were known as endorsers of ''single tax limited''.

==Synonyms and variants==

Most early advocacy groups described themselves as Single Taxers, and George reluctantly accepted "single tax" as an accurate name for his main political goal—the repeal of all unjust or inefficient taxes, to be replaced with a [[land value tax]] (LVT).

Some modern proponents are dissatisfied with the name ''Georgist''. While Henry George was well known throughout his life, he has been largely forgotten by the public and the idea of a single tax of land predates him. Some now prefer the term ''geoism'',&lt;ref name="Casal 2011 307–327" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truefreetrade.org/scg.htm Socialism, Capitalism, and Geoism] – by Lindy Davies&lt;/ref&gt; with the meaning of ''geo'' (from Greek {{lang|grc|γῆ}} ''gē'' "earth, land", as incidentally is in Greek the first compound of the name ''George'' (whence ''Georgism'') &lt; (Gr.) ''Geōrgios'' &lt; ''geōrgos'' "farmer" or ''geōrgia'' "agriculture, farming" &lt; ''gē'' + ''ergon'' "work")&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|gh{{=}}|γῆ|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|George}}&lt;/ref&gt; deliberately ambiguous.

These terms represent a difference of emphasis, and sometimes real differences about how land rent should be spent ([[citizen's dividend]] or just replacing other taxes); but all agree that land rent should be recovered from its private recipients.

Compulsory fines and fees related to land rents are the most common Georgist policies, but some geoists prefer voluntary [[value capture]] systems that rely on methods such as non-compulsory or self-assessed location value fees, [[community land trust]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Curtis |first=Mike |title=The Arden Land Trust |url=http://www.henrygeorge.org/mikerent.htm |accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and purchasing [[Covenant (law)|land value covenants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Martin |title=Sharing the Value of Land: The Promise of Location Value Covenants |url=https://medium.com/@martin_unitism/sharing-the-value-of-land-18066c10ac50 |accessdate=30 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530053734/https://medium.com/@martin_unitism/sharing-the-value-of-land-18066c10ac50 |archive-date=2014-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kent |first=Deirdre |title=Land and Money Reform Synergy in New Zealand |url=http://smarttaxes.org/2012/07/24/land-and-money-reform-synergy-in-new-zealand/ |publisher=Smart Taxes |accessdate=30 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605080303/http://smarttaxes.org/2012/07/24/land-and-money-reform-synergy-in-new-zealand/ |archivedate=5 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/wrigley-adrian_location-value-covenants-2010-06.pdf|title=Cooperative Individualism - Liberty Schools|website=www.cooperativeindividualism.org|accessdate=9 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604042754/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/wrigley-adrian_location-value-covenants-2010-06.pdf|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfrgroup.org/Home/location-value-covenants|title=Location Value Covenants - Systemic Fiscal Reform|website=www.sfrgroup.org|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foldvery |first=Fred |title=Geoanarchism A short summary of geoism and its relation to libertarianism. |url=http://www.anti-state.com/geo/foldvary1.html |accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Georgism has historically been considered as a radically [[progressivism|progressive]] or [[socialist]] ideology, some libertarians and [[Minarchism|minarchists]] take the position that limited social spending should be financed using Georgist concepts of rent [[value capture]], but that not all land rent should be captured. Today, this relatively conservative adaptation is usually considered incompatible with true [[geolibertarianism]], which requires that excess rents be gathered and then distributed back to residents. During Henry George's time, this restrained Georgist philosophy was known as "single tax limited", as opposed to "single tax unlimited". Henry George disagreed with the limited interpretation but accepted its adherents (e.g., [[Shearman &amp; Sterling|Thomas Shearman]]) as legitimate "single-taxers" [Georgists].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Charles A. |title=The Followers of Henry George |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/barker-charles_followers-of-henry-george-1953.html |publisher=Henry George News |accessdate=13 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113053410/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/barker-charles_followers-of-henry-george-1953.html |archivedate=13 January 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Milton Friedman]] in "Critical reception")

==Influence==
[[File:Henry George.png|thumb|Henry George|right|upright|[[Henry George]], whose writings and advocacy form the basis for Georgism.]]

Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early 20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas include the United States [[Commonwealth Land Party (United States)|Commonwealth Land Party]], the [[Henry George Justice Party]], the [[Single Tax League]], and Denmark's [[Justice Party of Denmark|Justice Party]].

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during 1909, the Liberal Government included a land tax as part of several taxes in the [[People's Budget]] intended to redistribute wealth (including a progressively graded income tax and an increase of inheritance tax). This caused a crisis which resulted indirectly in reform of the [[House of Lords]]. The budget was passed eventually—but without the land tax. In 1931, the minority Labour Government passed a land value tax as part III of the 1931 Finance act. However, this was repealed in 1934 by the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] before it could be implemented.

In [[Denmark]], the Georgist [[Justice Party of Denmark|Justice Party]] has previously been represented in [[Folketinget]]. It formed part of a centre-left government 1957–60 and was also represented in the [[European Parliament]] 1978–79. The influence of Henry George has waned over time, but Georgist ideas still occasionally emerge in politics. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|United States 2004 Presidential campaign]], [[Ralph Nader]] mentioned Henry George in his policy statements.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.votenader.org/issues/index.php?cid=7 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |date=2004-08-28 |accessdate=2012-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005612/http://www.votenader.org/issues/index.php?cid=7 |archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists still generally favor a land value tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Why Henry George had a point |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2015/04/land-value-tax |journal=The Economist |accessdate=29 June 2017|date=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]] publicly endorsed the Georgist land value tax as the "least bad tax".&lt;ref name="TidemanEngland1994"/&gt; [[Joseph Stiglitz]] stated that: "Not only was Henry George correct that a tax on land is non-distortionary, but in an equilibrium society … tax on land raises just enough revenue to finance the (optimally chosen) level of government expenditure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stiglitz |first1=Joseph |editor1-last=Feldstein |editor1-first=Martin |editor2-last=Inman |editor2-first=Robert |title=The Economics of Public Services |date=1977 |publisher=Macmillan Publishers |location=London |pages=274–333 |chapter=The theory of local public goods}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dubbed this proposition the [[Henry George theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Arnott |first=Richard J. |author2=Joseph E. Stiglitz |title=Aggregate Land Rents, Expenditure on Public Goods, and Optimal City Size |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |date=Nov 1979 |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=471–500 |jstor=1884466 |doi=10.2307/1884466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communities===
Several communities were also initiated with Georgist principles during the height of the philosophy's popularity. Two such communities that still exist are [[Arden, Delaware]], which was founded in 1900 by [[George Francis Stephens|Frank Stephens]] and [[Will Price]], and [[Fairhope, Alabama]], which was founded in 1894 by the auspices of the [[Fairhope Single Tax Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fairhopesingletax.com/|title=Fairhope Single Tax Corporation|website=Fairhope Single Tax Corporation|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some established communities in the United States also adopted Georgist tax policies. A Georgist in Houston, Texas, [[Joseph Jay Pastoriza|Joseph Jay "J.J." Pastoriza]], promoted a Georgist club in that city established in 1890. Years later, in his capacity as a city alderman, he was selected to serve as Houston Tax Commissioner, and promulgated a "Houston Plan of Taxation" in 1912. Improvements to land and merchants' inventories were taxed at 25 percent of appraised value, unimproved land was taxed at 70 percent of appraisal, and personal property was exempt. This Georgist tax continued until 1915, when two courts struck it down as violating the Texas Constitution in 1915. This quashed efforts in several other Texas cities which took steps towards implementing the Houston Plan in 1915: Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Galveston, San Antonio, and Waco.&lt;ref name=davis&gt;{{cite news|url=https://houstonhistorymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Stephen-Davis-Joseph-Jay-Pastoriza-and-the-Single-Tax-in-Houston-1911{{endash}}1917.pdf|title=Joseph Jay Pastoriza and the Single Tax in Houston, 1911{{endash}}1917|publisher=Houston Review: history and culture of the Gulf Coast|year=1986|last=Davis|first=Stephen|volume=8|number=2}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German protectorate of the [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] in Jiaozhou Bay, China fully implemented Georgist policy. Its sole source of government revenue was the land value tax of six percent which it levied in its territory. The German government had previously had economic problems with its African colonies caused by [[land speculation]]. One of the main reasons for using the land value tax in Jiaozhou Bay was to eliminate such speculation, which the policy achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Silagi |first1=Michael |last2=Faulkner |first2=Susan N |year= 1984|title=Land Reform in Kiaochow, China: From 1898 to 1914 the Menace of Disastrous Land Speculation was Averted by Taxation |url= |journal=[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]] |volume=43 |issue=2 |pages=167–77 |doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.1984.tb02240.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colony existed as a German protectorate from 1898 until 1914, when seized by Japanese and British troops. In 1922 the territory was returned to China.

Georgist ideas were also adopted to some degree in [[Australia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[South Africa]], [[South Korea]], and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. In these countries, governments still levy some type of land value tax, albeit with exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiststudies.org/george100years.html |title=Henry George 100 Years Later |last=Gaffney |first=M.

One exception is the town of [[Altoona, Pennsylvania]], which for a time in the 21st century only taxed land value, phasing in the tax in 2002, relying on it entirely for tax revenue from 2011, and ending it 2017; the ''[[Financial Times]]'' noted that "Altoona is using LVT in a city where neither land nor buildings have much value".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c92e084a-4300-11e4-8a43-00144feabdc0|title=Property: Land of opportunity|work=Financial Times|date=September 2014|last=Harding|first=Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.altoonamirror.com/news/local-news/2016/06/city-council-decides-to-cut-land-value-tax/|title=City council decides to cut land value tax|date=June 6, 2016|work=Altoona Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutes and organizations===

Various organizations still exist that continue to promote the ideas of Henry George. According to ''[[The American Journal of Economics and Sociology]]'', the periodical ''[[Land&amp;Liberty]]'', established in 1894, is "the longest-lived Georgist project in history".&lt;ref&gt;''The American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', vol. 62, 2003, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt; Founded during the [[Great Depression]] in 1932, the Henry George School of Social Science in New York offers courses, sponsors seminars, and publishes research in the Georgist paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Henry George School of Social Science |url=http://www.hgsss.org/about-us/ |website=hgsss.org |publisher=Henry George School of Social Science |accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the US, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy was established in 1974 based on the writings of Henry George. It "seeks to improve the dialogue about urban development, the built environment, and tax policy in the United States and abroad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lincolninst.edu/aboutlincoln/ |title=About the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy |publisher=Lincolninst.edu |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Henry George Foundation]] continues to promote the ideas of Henry George in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.henrygeorgefoundation.org |title=The Henry George Foundation |accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The IU]] is an international umbrella organisation that brings together organizations worldwide that seek land value tax reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theiu.org |author=The IU |title=The IU |accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The economist [[Alfred Marshall]] believed that George's views in ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' were dangerous, even predicting wars, terror, and economic destruction. Specifically, Marshall was upset about the idea of rapid change and the unfairness of not compensating existing landowners. In his lectures on ''Progress and Poverty'', Marshall opposed George's position on compensation while fully endorsing his ultimate remedy. So far as land value tax moderately replaced other taxes and did not cause the price of land to fall, Marshall supported [[land value taxation]] on economic and moral grounds, suggesting that a three or four percent tax on land values would fit this condition. After implementing land taxes, governments would purchase future land values at discounted prices and take ownership after 100 years. Marshall asserted that this plan, which he strongly supported, would end the need for a tax collection department of government. For newly formed countries where land was not already private, Marshall advocated implementing George's economic proposal immediately.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred. “Three Lectures on Progress and Poverty by Alfred Marshall.” The Journal of Law &amp; Economics, vol. 12, no. 1, 1969, pp. 184–226. www.jstor.org/stable/724986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Alfred, Principles of Economics. 1920. Library of Economics and Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Marx]] considered the Single Tax platform as a regression from the transition to [[communism]] and referred to Georgism as "Capitalism’s last ditch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Andelson |first=Robert V. |title=Henry George and The Reconstruction Of Capitalism |url=http://schalkenbach.org/on-line-library/works-by-robert-v-andelson/henry-george-and-the-reconstruction-of-capitalism/ |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx argued that, "The whole thing is ... simply an attempt, decked out with [[socialism]], to save capitalist domination and indeed to establish it afresh on an even wider basis than its present one."&lt;ref name="marx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/letters/81_06_20.htm|title=Letters: Marx-Engels Correspondence 1881|first=Karl|last=Marx|website=www.marxists.org|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also criticized the way land value tax theory emphasizes the value of land, arguing that, "His fundamental dogma is that everything would be all right if ground rent were paid to the state."&lt;ref name="marx" /&gt; Georgists such as [[Fred Harrison (Author)|Fred Harrison]] (2003) replied to these Marxist objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0254/is_5_62/ai_112083012/pg_1|title="Gronlund and other Marxists – Part III: nineteenth-century Americas critics", ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology''|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=9 October 2017|author=[[Fred Harrison (Author)|Fred Harrison]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard T. Ely]], known as the "Father of Land Economics",{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} agreed with the economic arguments for Georgism but believed that correcting the problem the way Henry George wanted (without compensation) was unjust to existing landowners. In explaining his position, Ely wrote that "If we have all made a mistake, should one party to the transaction alone bear the cost of the common blunder?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=George |first=Henry |title=A Response to Richard Ely On the Question of Compensation to Owners of Land |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/george-henry_a-response-to-richard-ely-on-the-question-of-compensation-to-land-owners-1887.html |accessdate=29 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529145606/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/george-henry_a-response-to-richard-ely-on-the-question-of-compensation-to-land-owners-1887.html |archivedate=29 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John R. Commons]] supported Georgist economics, but opposed what he perceived as an environmentally and politically reckless tendency for advocates to rely on a one-size-fits-all approach to tax reform, specifically, the "single tax" framing. Commons concluded ''The Distribution of Wealth'', with an estimate that "perhaps 95% of the total values represented by these millionnaire [''sic''] fortunes is due to those investments classed as land values and natural monopolies and to competitive industries aided by such monopolies", and that "tax reform should seek to remove all burdens from capital and labour and impose them on monopolies". However, he criticized Georgists for failing to see that Henry George's anti-monopoly ideas must be implemented with a variety of policy tools. He wrote, "Trees do not grow into the sky—they would perish in a high wind; and a single truth, like a single tax, ends in its own destruction." Commons uses the natural soil fertility and value of forests as an example of this destruction, arguing that a tax on the in situ value of those depletable natural resources can result in overuse or over-extraction. Instead, Commons recommends an income tax based approach to forests similar to a modern Georgist [[severance tax]].&lt;ref&gt;Commons, John R.

Other contemporaries such as [[Austrian School|Austrian]] economist [[Frank Fetter]] and [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economist [[John Bates Clark]] argued that it was impractical to maintain the traditional distinction between land and capital, and used this as a basis to attack Georgism. [[Mark Blaug]], a specialist in the history of economic thought, credits Fetter and Clark with influencing mainstream economists to abandon the idea "that land is a unique factor of production and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent" claiming that "this is in fact the basis of all the attacks on Henry George by contemporary economists and certainly the fundamental reason why professional economists increasingly ignored him".&lt;ref name="Blaug"&gt;Blaug, Mark. Interview in Andelson, Robert V.

Blackwell Publishing. 1979. p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Solow]] endorsed the theory of Georgism, but is wary of the perceived injustice of [[expropriation]]. Solow stated that taxing away expected land rents "would have no semblance of fairness"; however, Georgism would be good to introduce where location values were not already privatized or if the transition could be phased in slowly.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foldvery |first=Fred E. |title=Geo-Rent: A Plea to Public Economists |journal=Econ Watch |year=2005 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=106–32 |url=http://econjwatch.org/file_download/66/2005-04-foldvary-tyranny-statquo.pdf |accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Milton Friedman]] agreed that "the Henry George argument" is "the least bad" means of raising needed public revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNZMGdsJ2HMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Microeconomics|first1=N.

George has also been accused of exaggerating the importance of his "all-devouring rent thesis" in claiming that it is the primary cause of poverty and injustice in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critics of Henry George: An Appraisal of Their Strictures on Progress and Poverty, Vol. 1|editor-first=Robert V.|editor-last=Andelson|date=21 November 2003|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn = 978-1405118255}}&lt;/ref&gt; George argued that the rent of land increased faster than wages for labor because the supply of land is fixed. Modern economists, including [[Ottmar Edenhofer]] have demonstrated that George's assertion is plausible but was more likely to be true during George's time than now.&lt;ref name="econstor.eu" /&gt;

An early criticism of Georgism was that it would generate too much public revenue and result in unwanted growth of government, but later critics argued that it would not generate enough income to cover government spending. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] concluded his analysis of Georgism by stating that, "It is not economically unsound, except that it involves an unwarranted optimism concerning the yield of such a tax." Economists who study land conclude that Schumpeter's criticism is unwarranted because the rental yield from land is likely much greater than what modern critics such as [[Paul Krugman]] suppose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hudson |first1=Michael |title=A Philosophy for a Fair Society |date=1994 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0r2ZMHoDMAC |accessdate=18 January 2015|isbn=9780856831591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Krugman agrees that land value taxation is the best means of raising public revenue but asserts that increased spending has rendered land rent insufficient to fully fund government.&lt;ref&gt;https://psmag.com/news/this-land-is-your-land-3392 "urban economics models actually do suggest that Georgist taxation would be the right approach at least to finance city growth."/&lt;/ref&gt; Georgists have responded by citing studies and analyses implying that land values of nations like the US, UK, and Australia are more than sufficient to fund all levels of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The hidden taxable capacity of land: enough and to spare|first=|last=Mason Gaffney|date=13 March 2009|journal=International Journal of Social Economics|volume=36|issue=4|pages=328–411|doi=10.1108/03068290910947930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foldvery |first=Fred |title=The Ultimate Tax Reform: Public Revenue from Land Rent |url=http://www.foldvary.net/works/policystudy.pdf |accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven, Cord, "How Much Revenue would a Full Land Value Tax Yield?

[[Anarcho-capitalism|Anarcho-capitalist]] political philosopher and economist [[Murray Rothbard]] criticized Georgism in ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'' as being philosophically incongruent with [[subjective value theory]], and further stating that land is irrelevant in the factors of production, trade, and price systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothbard |first=Murray |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=Man, Economy, and State: A Treatise on Economic Principles |publisher=[[Van Nostrand]] |year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this critique is seen by some, including other opponents of Georgism, as relying on false assumptions and flawed reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heinrich |first1=David J |title=Murray Rothbard and Henry George |url=https://mises.org/blog/murray-rothbard-and-henry-george |website=www.mises.org |accessdate=28 August 2014|date=2004-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Austrian School|Austrian]] economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] credited early enthusiasm for Henry George with developing his interest in economics. Later, Hayek said that the theory of Georgism would be very strong if assessment challenges did not result in unfair outcomes, but he believed that they would.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andelson |first=Robert V. |title=On Separating the Landowner's Earned and Unearned Increment: A Georgist Rejoinder to F.

After studying ''Progress and Poverty'', [[Tyler Cowen]] concluded, "George had some good economic arguments, but [. . .] was politically naive. At the margin we should move in George’s direction, but ultimately landowners have to be part of the building coalitions rather than pure victims."&lt;ref&gt;Taxing Land to Pay for Trains Will Work.

==History==
HackingTeam was started by two Italian programmers: Alberto Ornaghi and Marco Valleri. Prior to the company's formal establishment, Ornaghi and Valleri (under the aliases of ALoR, and NaGA respectively), created a set of tools that could be used to monitor and remotely manipulate target computers. The program, called [[Ettercap (software)|Ettercap]], was embraced both by [[Hacker (term)|hackers]] looking to spy on people, and by companies that hoped to test the security of their own networks.

The Milan police department learned of the tools. Hoping to use Ettercap to spy on Italian citizens and listen to their [[Skype]] calls, the police contacted Ornaghi and Valleri and asked them to help modify the program. HackingTeam was born, and became "the first sellers of commercial hacking software to the police."&lt;ref name=Jeffries/&gt;

According to former employee Alberto Pelliccione, the company began as security services provider, offering [[penetration testing]], auditing and other defensive capabilities to clients.&lt;ref name=war&gt;Farivar, Cyrus (20 July 2015) [https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/italian-prosecutors-investigate-former-hacking-team-employees-for-role-in-hack/ HackingTeam goes to war against former employees, suspects some helped hackers]. ''Ars Technica''. Retrieved 26 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Pelliccione states that as malware and other offensive capabilities were developed and accounted for a larger percentage of revenues, the organization pivoted in a more offensive direction and became increasingly compartmentalized. Pelliccione claims fellow employees working on aspects of the same platform – for example, Android exploits and payloads – would not communicate with one another, possibly leading to tensions and strife within the organization.&lt;ref name=war/&gt;

In February 2014, a report from [[Citizen Lab]] identified the organisation to be using hosting services from [[Linode]], [[Telecom Italia]], [[Rackspace]], [[NOC4Hosts]] and notorious [[bullet proof hosting]] company [[Santrex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=HackingTeam's US Nexus|url=https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/hacking-teams-us-nexus/|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 2015 the company suffered a major data breach of customer data, software code, internal documents and e-mails. ''See: [[#2015 data breach|§ 2015 data breach]]''

== Controversies ==

=== Use by repressive governments ===
HackingTeam has been criticized for selling its products and services to governments with poor human rights records, including [[Sudan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=repress/&gt;

In June 2014, a United Nations panel monitoring the implementation of sanctions on Sudan requested information from HackingTeam about their alleged sales of software to the country in contravention of United Nations weapons export bans to Sudan. Documents leaked in the 2015 data breach of HackingTeam revealed the organization sold Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Service access to their "Remote Control System" software in 2012 for 960,000 Euros.&lt;ref name=repress/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/07/07/leaked-documents-confirm-hacking-team-sells-spyware-repressive-countries/|title=A Detailed Look at HackingTeam's Emails About Its Repressive Clients|last=Hay Newman|first=Lily|website=The Intercept|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the United Nations panel, the company responded in January 2015 that they were not currently selling to Sudan. In a follow-up exchange, HackingTeam asserted that their product was not controlled as a weapon, and so the request was beyond the scope of the panel. There was no need for them to disclose previous sales, which they considered confidential business information.&lt;ref name=repress&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Detailed Look at HackingTeam’s Emails About Its Repressive Clients |url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/07/07/leaked-documents-confirm-hacking-team-sells-spyware-repressive-countries/ |accessdate=7 July 2015 |first1=Cora |last1=Currier |first2=Morgan |last2=Marquis-Boire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/07/hacking-team-leaks-reveal-spyware-industrys-growth|title=HackingTeam Leaks Reveal Spyware Industry's Growth, Negligence of Human Rights|last=Myers West|first=Sarah|date=2015-07-08|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.N. disagreed. "The view of the panel is that as such software is ideally suited to support military electronic intelligence (ELINT) operations it may potentially fall under the category of 'military ... equipment' or 'assistance' related to prohibited items," the secretary wrote in March. "Thus its potential use in targeting any of the belligerents in the Darfur conflict is of interest to the Panel."&lt;ref name=repress/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/hacking-teams-lame-excuse-for-selling-digital-weapons-t-1716375503|title=HackingTeam's Lame Excuse for Selling Digital Weapons to Sudan|last=Knibbs|first=Kate|date=2015-07-08|website=Gizmodo|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2014, the Italian government abruptly froze all of HackingTeam's exports, citing human rights concerns. After lobbying Italian officials, the company temporarily won back the right to sell its products abroad.&lt;ref name=repress/&gt;

=== 2015 data breach ===
On July 5, 2015, the [[Twitter]] account of the company was compromised by an unknown individual who published an announcement of a [[data breach]] against HackingTeam's computer systems. The initial message read, "''Since [[Nothing to hide argument|we have nothing to hide]], we're publishing all our e-mails, files, and source code ...''" and provided links to over 400 [[gigabyte]]s of data, including alleged internal e-mails, invoices, and [[source code]]; which were leaked via [[BitTorrent]] and [[Mega (service)|Mega]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/hackingteam |title=Hacked Team (@hackingteam) |accessdate=2015-07-06 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706010312/https://twitter.com/hackingteam |archivedate=July 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An announcement of the data breach, including a link to the bittorrent seed, was retweeted by [[WikiLeaks]] and by many others through social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |author= [[WikiLeaks]] |user= wikileaks|number= 617865712611233792 |date= July 6, 2015 |title= Inside malware makers "HackingTeam": hundreds of gigabytes of e-mails, files, and source code |access-date= July 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimes.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hacking-team-hacked-spy-tools-sold-oppressive-regimes-sudan-bahrain-kazakhstan-1509460|title=HackingTeam hacked: Spy tools sold to oppressive regimes Sudan, Bahrain and Kazakhstan|date=2015-06-06|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=2015-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material was voluminous and early analysis appeared to reveal that HackingTeam had invoiced the [[Lebanese Army]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Twitter|SynAckPwn/status/617955067006578689}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sudan]] and that spy tools were also sold to [[Bahrain]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes.co.uk"/&gt; HackingTeam had previously claimed they had never done business with Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HackingTeam hacked, attackers claim 400GB in dumped data|url = http://www.csoonline.com/article/2943968/data-breach/hacking-team-hacked-attackers-claim-400gb-in-dumped-data.html|accessdate = 2015-07-06|first = Steve|last = Ragan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DLL is run in [[protection ring|kernel mode]], so the attack could perform [[privilege escalation]] to bypass the [[sandbox (computer security)|sandbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Look at the Open Type Font Manager Vulnerability from the HackingTeam Leak|url = http://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/a-look-at-the-open-type-font-manager-vulnerability-from-the-hacking-team-leak/|accessdate = 2015-07-08|first = Jack|last = Tang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also revealed in leaked data was HackingTeam employees' use of weak passwords, including 'P4ssword', 'wolverine', and 'universo'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HackingTeam used shockingly bad passwords|url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/no-wonder-hacking-team-got-hacked/|accessdate = 2015-07-06|first = Zack|last = Whittaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for this attack was claimed by the hacker known as "Phineas Fisher" (or Phisher) on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet | user=gammagrouppr | author=Phineas Fisher | number=617937092497178624 | title=gamma and HT down, a few more to go :) | date=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phineas has previously attacked spyware firm [[Gamma International]], who produce malware, such as [[FinFisher]], for governments and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HackingTeam: We won't 'shrivel up and go away' after cyberattack|url = http://www.zdnet.com/article/hacking-team-cyberattack-aftermath-interview/|accessdate = 2015-07-06|first = Charlie|last = Osbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Phineas published details of the attack, in Spanish and English, as a "how-to" for others, and explained the motivations behind the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2016/04/how-hacking-team-got-hacked-phineas-phisher/|title=How HackingTeam got hacked|website=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal documents revealed details of HackingTeam's contracts with repressive governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/07/07/leaked-documents-confirm-hacking-team-sells-spyware-repressive-countries/|title=A Detailed Look at HackingTeam's Emails About Its Repressive Clients|website=The Intercept|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Italian government again revoked the company's license to sell spyware outside of Europe without special permission.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/04/08/hacking-team-loses-global-license-to-sell-spyware/|title=HackingTeam loses global license to sell spyware|last=Zorabedian|first=John|date=2016-04-08|website=Naked Security|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/826|title=HackingTeam's Global License Revoked by Italian Export Authorities {{!}} Privacy International|website=www.privacyinternational.org|access-date=2016-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customer list ==
HackingTeam's clientele include not just governments, but also corporate clients such as [[Barclay's]] Bank and [[British Telecom]] (BT) of the [[United Kingdom]], as well as [[Deutsche Bank]] of [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=spies/&gt;

A full list of HackingTeam's customers were leaked in the 2015 breach. Disclosed documents show HackingTeam had 70 current customers, mostly military, police, federal and provincial governments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">The '''International Carbon Action Partnership''' (ICAP) was founded in 2007 by more than 15 government representatives as an international cooperative forum, bringing together states and sub-national jurisdictions that have implemented or are planning to implement [[Emissions trading|emissions trading systems]] (ETS). Then governor of California, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], stated at ICAP's founding ceremony:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''"This first of its kind partnership will provide more incentives for clean-tech investment and economic growth while not letting polluters off the hook. And it will help renew the health of our planet."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[José Sócrates]], the Portuguese prime minister further added that ICAP was launched in order to join carbon markets all over the world and by that be more successful in combating climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/index.php?option=com_attach&amp;task=download&amp;id=33 |title=Data |website=icapcarbonaction.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICAP includes members from the [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme]] (EU ETS), [[Western Climate Initiative]] (WCI), [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI), [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], and the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]].  [[Japan]] and [[Ukraine]] are observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icapcarbonaction.com |title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) |publisher=Icapcarbonaction.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;Member jurisdictions share best practices and discuss ETS design elements with a view to creating a well-functioning global carbon market.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/partnership/political-declaration |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027143356/https://icapcarbonaction.com/partnership/political-declaration |archivedate=2014-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind ICAP’s work is that linking carbon cap and trade systems would lead to economic, social and environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://climatestrategies.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/executive-summary-linking-final-may-09.pdf |title=Strategies |website=climatestrategies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mcc-berlin.net/fileadmin/data/pdf/Publikationen/Flachsland_Marschinski_Edenhofer_2009_To_link_or_not_to_link.pdf |title= Research |website=mcc-berlin.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
ICAP functions as an open forum of governments and public authorities working on [[Emissions trading|cap and trade]] systems. The main bodies of ICAP are the Plenary and the Steering Committee. The day-to-day work is supported by the ICAP Secretariat based in Berlin, Germany, under the guidance of the ICAP Co-Chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/partnership/about|title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)|first=Michel|last=Frerk|website=International Carbon Action Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

* Share best practices and learning from each other’s experience of ETSs
* Help policy makers recognize ETS design compatibility issues and opportunities for the establishment of an ETS at an early stage
* Facilitate possible future linking of trading programs
* Highlight the key role of cap and trade as an effective climate policy response
* Build and strengthen partnerships amongst governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icapcarbonaction.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=75&amp;Itemid=99&amp;lang=en |title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) |publisher=Icapcarbonaction.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-17 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Activities ==

ICAP’s work focuses on three pillars: technical dialog, ETS knowledge sharing and capacity building activities.

=== Technical dialog ===

Relevant topics addressed under ICAP’s technical dialog include for example linking ETS, allocation methods, [[Measurable, Reportable, Verifiable|MRV]], [[Carbon offsets|offsets]] and [[carbon leakage]]. Events under this work stream bring together representatives from ICAP jurisdictions with international and local experts to share their expertise on technical issues and to discuss measures to contribute to furthering a global carbon market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/activities/technical-dialog|title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)|first=Franz|last=Orschulik|website=International Carbon Action Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== ETS knowledge sharing ===

ICAP acts as a knowledge sharing hub, disseminating knowledge on existing and planned ETS, as well as the general benefits and design aspects of an ETS. Addressing the growing demand for reliable and detailed information on emissions trading worldwide, ICAP developed an interactive ICAP ETS Map,  which offers an up-to-date overview on existing ETSs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/ets-map|title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)|website=International Carbon Action Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the ´ICAP Status Report: Emissions Trading Worldwide`&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/component/attach/?task=download&amp;id=152|title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)|website=International Carbon Action Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;  provides factsheets on all existing and planned ETSs, and includes infographics to allow for an easy comparison of systems.  Policymakers and carbon market experts also share their insight into key milestones in setting up and running an ETS. Additionally, ICAP also runs workshops and side events at the [[Conferences of the Parties of UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol|United Nations Climate Change Conferences]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://icapcarbonaction.com/activities/unfccc-side-events]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Capacity building ===

Since 2009, ICAP has also been actively engaged in capacity building for emerging and developing countries by organizing training courses for participants from emerging and developing countries on technical issues of designing and implementing carbon cap and trade systems.  As of February 2015, the ICAP alumni community consisted of 317 course participants from 39 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://icapcarbonaction.com/activities/icap-courses|title=International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)|first=Super|last=User|website=International Carbon Action Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;    


== Current members ==
As of January 2017, ICAP had 31 full members and 4 observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== ICAP Status Report ==

ICAP's annual report, ''''[https://icapcarbonaction.com/status-report-2015 Emissions Trading Worldwide: Status Report]'''', highlights the spread of emissions trading worldwide. With 17 systems operating in jurisdictions that vary largely in their geographical scope, economic profile and energy mix, the report showcases the diversity and flexibility of emissions trading.

The '''Island of Ireland Peace Park''' and its surrounding park ({{lang-ga|Páirc Síochána d'Oileán na hÉireann}}), also called the '''Irish Peace Park''' or '''Irish Peace Tower''' in [[Mesen|Messines]], near [[Ypres]] in [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], is a [[war memorial]] to the soldiers of the island of [[Ireland]] who died, were wounded or are missing from [[World War I]], during [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland's involvement]] in the conflict. The tower memorial is close to the site of the June 1917 battle of [[Battle of Messines (1917)#Battle|Messines Ridge]], during which the [[16th (Irish) Division]] fought alongside the [[36th (Ulster) Division]].

==Development==
Because of the events of the [[Easter Rising|Easter Rebellion]] in 1916 and the partition of Ireland under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] in 1922 and the [[Irish Civil War]] that followed it, little was done in the [[Republic of Ireland]] to commemorate the Irish dead from the Great War or World War II. Those countries who were engaged in the Great War all preserve the memory of their fallen soldiers with national monuments in the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] area. This led to some ill-feeling in the already crowded emotions of the conflict on the island, and perhaps was highlighted when [[Northern Ireland]]'s community's [[Ulster Tower Thiepval]] in [[France]] was one of the first memorials erected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmatters.net/monuments/ww1_irish_mesen_1.htm Webmatters.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515223110/http://www.webmatters.net/monuments/ww1_irish_mesen_1.htm |date=15 May 2011 }} undated&lt;/ref&gt;

This Tower memorial, however, serves not to "redress the balance" but rather to recall the sacrifices of those from the island of Ireland from all political and religious traditions who fought and died in the war.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It also serves as a symbol of modern-day reconciliation. The Tower houses bronze cubicles containing record books listing the known dead, which are publicly accessible copies of the originals belonging to the [[National War Memorial, Islandbridge|National War Memorial]], Islandbridge, Dublin.

The project was initiated by a member of the Irish Parliament (Dail Eireann), Paddy Harte TD, who, together with a community activist, Glen Barr from Northern Ireland, established 'A Journey of Reconciliation Trust'. The Trust was a broad-based, cross-border, organisation with offices in Dublin.   The Trust was made up of representatives of the main churches in Ireland and professional political and representatives and community leaders from both parts of Ireland under the leadership of [[Paddy Harte]] and [[Glenn Barr]].&lt;ref name="IFA"&gt;[http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/Press_Releases/19981020/160.htm Republic of Ireland Department for Foreign Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041205004506/http://foreignaffairs.gov.ie/Press_Releases/19981020/160.htm |date=5 December 2004 }}, 20 October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish government became involved in part funding the project together wit the Northern Ireland Office. Statutory and private bodies rolled in behind the project and within two years of the initiation of the JRT the Island of Ireland Peace Park and Celtic Round tower was complete.  It was formally opened by the Irish President Mary McAleese who in the presence of Queen Elizabeth and King Albert of Belgium led the wreath laying ceremony in the afternoon of 11th of November 1998.  It was the first time an Irish State officially acknowledged the soldiers from Ireland who died in WW!.  This was also a seminal moment in Irish history when an Irish Head of State and a British Monarch met publicly in a joint ceremony. The Park is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on behalf of the Office of Public Works in Ireland.  Prior to the Island of Ireland Peace Park, no Irish government dignitary had ever attended any WW1 Remembrance Service either in Ireland or at the Menin Gate. At an official ceremony on 11th November 1998 the Irish President apologised on behalf of the Republic of Ireland to the families of the fallen for what she called the 'national amnesia' in remembering the soldiers of WW1 from the Island of Ireland.

==Design==
[[Image:Irish-peace-tower-counties-belgium.redvers.jpg|right|thumb|The counties of Ireland, &lt;br&gt;symbolically run together.]]
The {{convert|110|ft|m|adj=on}} tower&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A53707163/GPS?sid=wikipedia   |title=The Tower of Peace |work=[[World of Hibernia]] |volume=Winter 1998 |page=18 |via=[[General OneFile]] |accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is in the traditional design of an [[Irish round tower]] and is partially built with stone from a former British Army barracks in [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]], the remainder of the stone from a work-house outside [[Mullingar]], County Westmeath.

The design has a unique aspect that allows the sun to light the interior only on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, the anniversary of the armistice that ended the war and the time for the minute's silence on Remembrance Day.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/212208.stm BBC News], 11 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

A commemorative ceremony is held yearly in the park on Armistice Day in conjunction with similar ceremonies at the nearby multi-national [[Menin Gate Memorial]] in Ypres.

==Unveiling==
The tower was unveiled in the afternoon on 11 November 1998 by President [[Mary McAleese]] of Ireland, [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom and [[Albert II of Belgium|King Albert II]] of Belgium.

In her speech, President McAleese said:{{cquote|Today's ceremony at the Peace Park was not just another journey down a well-travelled path. For much of the past eighty years, the very idea of such a ceremony would probably have been unthinkable.&lt;br /&gt;Those whom we commemorate here were doubly tragic. They fell victim to a war against oppression in Europe. Their memory too fell victim to a war for independence at home in Ireland.|author=[[Mary McAleese]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.president.ie/index.php?section=5&amp;speech=172&amp;lang=eng Irish President's website]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Speaking at the Park on the anniversary of the Battle of Messines Ridge on 7 June 2004, the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Dermot Ahern]] commented that honouring the spirit of the Irish  killed in the First World War can teach how to advance the [[Northern Ireland]] peace process in Northern Ireland.  adding:{{cquote|All those untold human stories that we lost in the first World War and more recently in the conflict in Northern Ireland, must be remembered. And, in remembering, they must not be told for nothing. They must not be told to deepen divisions. They must be told to inspire us to overcome them.|author=[[Dermot Ahern]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Irish Times]]'', pg. 11 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Irish 'Peace Pledge' plaque, Messines, Belgium.jpg|thumb|160px|left|'''''Peace Pledge''''' plaque, &lt;br&gt;in the park's centre circle.]]

==Peace Pledge==
A bronze tablet on a granite pillar positioned in the centre circle of the park bears the following inscription, entitled:&lt;center&gt;'''''Peace Pledge''''' &lt;/center&gt;
{{cquote|From the crest of this ridge, which was the scene of terrific carnage in the First World War on which we have built a peace park and Round Tower to commemorate the thousands of young men from all parts of Ireland who fought a common enemy, defended democracy and the rights of all nations, whose graves are in shockingly uncountable numbers and those who have no graves, we condemn war and the futility of war. We repudiate and denounce violence, aggression, intimidation, threats and unfriendly behaviour.

As Protestants and Catholics, we apologise for the terrible deeds we have done to each other and ask forgiveness. From this sacred shrine of remembrance, where soldiers of all nationalities, creeds and political allegiances were united in death, we appeal to all people in Ireland to help build a peaceful and tolerant society. Let us remember the solidarity and trust that developed between Protestant and Catholic soldiers when they served together in these trenches.

As we jointly thank the armistice  of 11 November 1918 – when the guns fell silent along this western front - we affirm that a fitting tribute to the principles for which men and women from the Island of Ireland died in both World Wars would be permanent peace.}}

==Messines Peace Village==
The completion of the Peace Park ultimately led to the development and construction of the [http://www.peacevillage.be Messines Peace Village], an international rural hostel equipped for seminars and meetings, ideal for associations, companies, youth and school groups.

The first stone was placed on 7 June 2005 by [[Taoiseach|Taoiseach na hÉireann]] (Prime Minister of Ireland) [[Bertie Ahern]] in the presence of the Mayor of Messines, Sandy Evrard and the Flemish Minister of Administrative Affairs, Foreign Policy, Media and Tourism, Geert Bourgeois.

Only one year later, the Peace Village was officially opened. The inauguration took place on 7 June 2006 by the Irish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Dermot Ahern]], the British Minister for Northern Ireland, [[David Hanson (politician)|David Hanson]], the Flemish Minister of Administrative Affairs, Foreign Policy, Media and Tourism, Geert Bourgeois and Sandy Evrard, the Mayor of Messines.

The '''People's Party – Our Slovakia''' ({{lang-sk|Ľudová strana – Naše Slovensko}}, ĽSNS), since November 2015 officially known as '''Kotleba – People's Party Our Slovakia''' ({{lang-sk|Kotleba – Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko|links=no}}), is a [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[national populist]] [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]]&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politico.eu"/&gt; [[List of political parties in Slovakia|political party]] in [[Slovakia]].&lt;ref name="Vicenova13"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Radka |last=Vicenová |title=Slovakia: right-wing extremism on the rise |work=openDemocracy |date=19 December 2013 |url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/radka-vicenov%C3%A1/slovakia-right-wing-extremism-on-rise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first1=Miroslav |last1=Mareš |first2=Richard |last2=Stojar |title=Extreme right perpetrators |work=Understanding Lone Actor Terrorism: Past experience, future outlook, and response strategies |publisher=Routledge |year=2016 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nociar12_5s"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nociar|first=Tomáš|date=December 2012|title=Right-Wing Extremism in Slovakia|url=http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id-moe/09567.pdf|pages=5–6|work=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung International Policy Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pytlas2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bartek Pytlas|title=Radical Right Parties in Central and Eastern Europe: Mainstream Party Competition and Electoral Fortune|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOC9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA224|year=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-49586-4|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party declares that it builds on the legacy of [[Jozef Tiso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naseslovensko.net/o-nas/|title=O nás|newspaper=Kotleba - Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko|access-date=2017-02-14|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's platform includes anti-Roma rhetoric,&lt;ref name="Nociar12_5s" /&gt; immigration control, Christian morality, paternalism on economic issues, interest-free national loans, replacement of the [[euro]] currency with the [[Slovak koruna]], law and order, rejection of the idea of same-sex [[civil union]]s, and criticism of the country's current leadership and foreign policy. The party proposes to reduce the number of parliamentarians from 150 to 100 members, to widen freedom of speech, to establish a home guard, and to withdraw the Slovak military from missions abroad. Moreover, it wants Slovakia to leave the [[European Union]], [[European Monetary Union]] and [[NATO]].&lt;ref name="Nociar12_5s"/&gt;

== History ==
The origins of the party are closely related to the nationalist [[Slovak Brotherhood|Slovak Togetherness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Tomáš |last=Nociar |title=Right-Wing Extremism in Slovakia |work=Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung International Policy Analysis |date=December 2012 |pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the movement tried to run in the 2006 elections under the name ''Slovak Togetherness – National Party'', but the party was dissolved by the Supreme Court on grounds of anti-constitutional activities.&lt;ref name="Perex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/150013-najvyssi-sud-rozpustil-slovensku-pospolitost |title= Najvyšší súd rozpustil Slovenskú pospolitosť| trans-title = The Supreme Court dissolved Slovak Togetherness | website=Pravda |publisher=Perex |date=1 March 2006 |access-date=7 March 2016 |language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of founding a whole new party, members of Slovak Togetherness under the leadership of [[Marian Kotleba]] entered the tiny ''Party of Friends of Wine'' that had existed since 2000, changed its name to ''People's Party of Social Solidarity'' in May 2009 and then to ''People’s Party – Our Slovakia'' in early 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ives.sk/registre/detailuplnyps.do?action=uplny&amp;formular=&amp;id=153101 |title=Register of Political Parties and Political Movements | website=Organization for Information Technologies of Public Administration |publisher=Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic |access-date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to avoid legal difficulties with registering a new party under this name given that a different party called ''Our Slovakia'' already existed.&lt;ref name="Nociar12_5s"/&gt;

During the elections of 2016, the party nominated several candidates seen as controversial, such as an ex-singer of [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] music bands [[Krátky proces]] and [[Juden Mord]] and a candidate who openly admired [[Adolf Hitler]] and promoted Hlinka's historical [[Slovak People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnonline.sk/slovensko/592397-fanusik-hitlera-ci-spevak-juden-mordu-aj-tito-kandiduju-do-parlamentu |title=Fanúšik Hitlera či spevák Juden Mordu, aj títo kandidujú do parlamentu| trans-title= A fan of Adolf Hitler and a singer of Juden Mord - also these candidate to the parliament | website=HN Online |publisher=MAFRA Slovakia, a.s.| date=17 February 2016 |access-date=7 March 2016 |language=Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of fascism ==
The party is perceived by liberal politicians and part of the populace as being [[Fascism|fascist]]. This is due to some members of the party being connected to extremist movements such as the [[Slovak Brotherhood]] in Kotleba's case or the fact the party and its members requested a minute of silence for [[Jozef Tiso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tellmamauk.org/tag/marian-kotleba/|title=Marian Kotleba Archives - TELL MAMA|website=TELL MAMA|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; who supported and actively put laws in place during the [[Second World War]] that discriminated against Jews and made the country pay [[Nazi Germany]] to transfer [[History of the Jews in Slovakia|Slovak Jews]] into concentration camps. Under Jozef Tiso regime Slovakia attacked Poland in 1939.  Kotleba and his party was also described by both the Slovak President [[Andrej Kiska]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spectator.sme.sk/c/20133813/kiska-lets-be-clear-kotleba-is-fascist.html|title=Kiska: Let’s be clear, Kotleba is fascist|last=a.s.|first=Petit Press|newspaper=spectator.sme.sk|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Czech President [[Miloš Zeman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.novinky.cz/domaci/396911-zeman-kotlebova-lidova-strana-je-fasisticka.html|title=Zeman: Kotlebova Lidová strana je fašistická|newspaper=Novinky.cz|access-date=2017-02-14|language=cs-CZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; as fascist. The party denies any connection to fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naseslovensko.net/tlacove-konferencie/tlacova-konferencia-vznik-politickej-policie-povazujeme-za-prejav-fasizmu-vladnej-moci/|title=Tlačová konferencia: Vznik politickej polície považujeme za prejav fašizmu vládnej moci|newspaper=Kotleba - Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko|access-date=2017-02-14|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, the General Prosecutors Office of the Slovak Republic made a submission to the Supreme Court, requesting a dissolution of the party.  The General Prosecutors Office reasoned this step by alleged pro-fascist tendencies of the party, violation of the constitution of the Slovak Republic and violation of Slovak and international laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/430584-ciznar-dal-navrh-na-rozpustenie-kotlebovej-strany/|title=Čižnár dal návrh na rozpustenie Kotlebovej strany|website=Pravda|language=Slovak|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2018 during the party congress meeting, a new logo was propossed, replacing the old one that had straight winged Slovak double cross without national mountains inspired and used by [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party]] and [[Hlinka Guard]] during the [[Slovak State|First Slovak Republic]], with the new one that has classic Slovak double cross with national mountains in it. Party said that they changed the logo to distance themselves from fascism, nazism, or any form of extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.naseslovensko.net/nasa-praca/zo-zakulisia-ls-nase-slovensko-zaznam-z-celostatneho-snemu-predstavenie-noveho-loga-strany/|title=Zo zákulisia ĽS Naše Slovensko: Záznam z celoštátneho snemu, predstavenie nového loga strany|website=naseslovensko.sk|language=Slovak|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program ==
Kotleba – People's Party Our Slovakia wants a "functioning state" that is free from corruption, foreign influences and "larceny of public finance". It seeks to give the general public the power to abjure and renounce any member of the parliament and it wishes to decrease the total number of seats from 150 to 100. Additionally it wants to introduce a flat tax rate of 15% and stop the financing of campaigns for political parties from the state budget.&lt;ref name="naseslovensko.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naseslovensko.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Volebn%C3%BD-program-2016.pdf |title=Program |website=www.naseslovensko.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party sees the [[EU]] and [[NATO]] as undermining the sovereignty of the Slovak nation and wants to leave these organizations to give Slovakia full [[sovereignty]] and not be part of "[[United States war crimes|American war crimes]] and a toy in hands to foreign superpowers". ĽSNS also advocates the investigation of foreign [[NGO]]s for possible unlawful or corrupting activity and to "liberate Slovakia from the slavery of foreign bankers".&lt;ref name="naseslovensko.net"/&gt;

For internal security, the party wants to establish a home guard that can protect the people where the normal police forces are not adequate at stopping "Gypsy extremists" who "steal, rape and murder" the "Honest people" while also advocating the use of weapons for protection of personal life and private property. It also wants to make politicians responsible for any criminal or corrupt activity they partake in while being a public servant and to be punished accordingly. ĽSNS wants to make police forces train in illegal settlements inhabited by the resident Romani populace and demolish any illegal constructions whether they are "Black Settlements or Palaces of The rich". The party wants to re-establish border control on each of the country's borders and give the parliament the ability to use the army to enforce these borders if necessary. Due to the country's armed forces being small and ill-prepared, it is seen as necessary to modernize, renew, and increase the size of the army to be able to protect the nation effectively from any threats when it leaves NATO, to prevent the "hordes of Muslim immigrants" from coming to Slovakia and to protect [[Christianity]] and [[Culture of Europe|European culture]].&lt;ref name="naseslovensko.net"/&gt;

The party wants to give jobs to the long-term unemployed. These jobs consist of the maintenance of roads, schools, national memorials, hospitals and construction of housing as part of their social policy. The retirement age would be set to 60 years of age and the government would increase financial benefits for mothers with children; with rent-able housing being provided to "polite and proper families" and the cancellation of benefits to "non-working gypsy thieves". The party wants to nationalize the health care system to provide free healthcare for the citizens as written in the constitution of Slovakia and create one nationwide health insurance firm. Additionally, the party wants to return to one statewide emergency service and to make sure that every ambulance has a doctor on board to administer appropriate care. Furthermore, the party wants to rear children with traditional and Christian values, to protect them from violent media and to stop the service of gambling machines while supporting domestic media producers and artists to prevent a "degenerate society" made by "[[consumerism]] and empty [[liberalism]]".&lt;ref name="naseslovensko.net"/&gt;

In terms of the economy, the party wants to also nationalize all strategic industries such as power stations, steel manufacturing or public transport. The party wants to create energy self-sufficiency and food self-sufficiency to make the country less dependent on imports by rebuilding the agricultural industry. The party wants to get rid of bureaucracy in business to increase growth of domestic companies and it rejects the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership|TTIP agreement]]. In addition the party wants to exit the [[European Monetary Union]] and re-establish the previous currency ([[Slovak koruna]]) to give the state and the central bank authority to decide on the monetary policy. Moreover, the party also wants to protect the environment from pollution and exploitation by implementing laws and regulation and support [[alternative energy]].&lt;ref name="naseslovensko.net"/&gt;[[File:ĽSNS.png|thumb|130px|Former party logo (2010–2018)]]

== Views on Roma and migrants ==
The party sees and describes the unintegrated groups of [[Romani people]] as being a drain on the social security system due to large Roma families receiving a higher amount of benefits for children compared to ethnic Slovaks, this especially applies to illegal roma settlements, where these "gypsy extremists", as the party calls them, often live. Occasionally the party has said that it wants to stop "Gypsy terror" and uses the [[Krásna Hôrka Castle]] fire of 2012 as an example, whilst using rhetoric that describes the "gypsy extremists" as a social "parasites" and "extremists" that "steal, rape and murder".&lt;ref name="naseslovensko.net"/&gt;

According to the party, immigrants from third world countries are invaders who are supported by globalists to destroy the old continent of Europe. The party is against any acceptance of even a single refugee, stating that even one is too much, while blaming EU and Schengen for migrant invasion.&lt;ref name="naseslovensko.net"/&gt;

== Pro-Russian sentiment==
Marian Kotleba while being just a governor of the [[Banská Bystrica region]], wrote a letter on 31 January 2014 personally to [[Viktor Yanukovych]] during the unrest in Ukraine, saying to him "As a fellow Slav not to surrender his country to EU interests, markets and NATO aggression, to stay vigilant against foreign coup, and to remember what happened to Serbian national heroes such as [[Slobodan Milošević]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.topky.sk/cl/100535/1376595/Kotleba-napisal-Janukovycovi-otvoreny-list|title=Kotleba napísal Janukovyčovi otvorený list|newspaper=Topky.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August 2014, Marian Kotleba hung up a sign saying "Yankees go home! STOP NATO!" on the governor's building in [[Banská Bystrica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webnoviny.sk/slovensko/clanok/861436-marian-kotleba-vyvesil-na-urad-vlajku-s-napisom-stop-nato/|title=Kotleba dal na úrad transparent Yankees go home!

On 5 May 2016, the Kotleba party in the Banská Bystrica region hung up a Russian flag in the city of [[Banská Bystrica]] to show sympathy with the Russian community in the city and the motorcycle club the [[Night Wolves]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pluska.sk/plus-7-dni/domov/kotleba-zase-predviedol-urad-bbsk-zavesil-rusku-vlajku.html|title=Kotleba sa zase predviedol: Na Úrad BBSK zavesil ruskú vlajku, je to ťah na voličov?|newspaper=www.pluska.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came to commemorate the Russian victory over fascism. The party also sent 3 people, including 1 MP, to commemorate together at the SNP monument and museum, however party leader Marian Kotleba denounced Allied champaign in [[Slovak National Uprising]] and indirectly endorsed Axis [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|WWII Slovak Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://spravy.pravda.sk/domace/clanok/366071-kotleba-na-vyrocie-snp-vyvesil-cierne-zastavy-kanik-poda-trestne-oznamenie/|title=Kotleba vyvesil čierne zástavy.

This is one of the reasons for which the party wants Slovakia to leave NATO.

On 2 February 2017, Marian Kotleba and his party spoke against sending 152 Slovak soldiers contingent on NATO training mission in Latvia near Russian border, stating that it was a clear provocation of the Russian Federation by the NATO pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.naseslovensko.net/nase-nazory/zahranicna-politika/vladna-koalicia-s-podporou-sas-a-olano-schvalila-vyslanie-slovenskeho-vojska-na-ruske-hranice/|title=Vládna koalícia s podporou SaS a OĽaNO schválila vyslanie slovenského vojska na ruské hranice!|newspaper=Kotleba - Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt; During voting time about this issue in Slovak parliament, only his party and Sme Rodina voted against sending troops on this NATO mission, all other parties supported it. He also accused the government and opposition of acting like Nazis and Hitler in 1941 when he was preparing to attack Soviet Union, before [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aktualne.atlas.sk/slovensko/politika/do-lotysska-vysleme-152-vojakov-cvicit-budu-obranu-vychodnej-hranice-nato.html|title=Do Lotyšska vyšleme 152 vojakov.

On 2 June 2017, Party was accused of being financed by Alexander Usovskij from Belarus, after his emails were leaked to the public and German ZDF television reported about this. It is said that he was supplying money from Russian Federation to Eastern European countries, including Slovakia, to fuel pro-Russian activities, even mentioning that Usovskij is supporting ĽSNS work. Usovskij denied to be in contact with ĽSNS, but said that he sympathises with party activities, agreeing with their bid for a referendum to leave NATO. ZDF also added that he may had been looking for investors for this referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hnonline.sk/slovensko/970565-bielorus-ktory-mal-posielat-na-slovensko-peniaze-z-ruska-podporujem-myslienku-kotlebu|title=Bielorus, ktorý mal posielať na Slovensko peniaze z Ruska: Podporujem myšlienku Kotlebu|newspaper=hnonline.sk|language=sk-SK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11315">A '''Krishi Vigyan Kendra''' (KVK) is an [[agricultural extension]] center in India. The name means "farm science center". Usually associated with a local agricultural university, these centers serve as the ultimate link between the [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]] and farmers, and aim to apply agricultural research in a practical, localized setting. All KVKs fall under the jurisdiction of one of the 11 Agricultural Technology Application Research Institutes (ATARIs) throughout India.

As of October 2018, the number of KVKs in India is somewhat disputed. While one source cites 700 KVKs,&lt;ref name="ICAR_KVK_info"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Agricultural Extension Division &amp;#124; भारतीय कृषि अनुसंधान परिषद | url=https://www.icar.org.in/content/agricultural_extension_division | website=Icar.org.in | accessdate=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; another lists 695,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="ICAR KVK Info"|url=https://icar.org.in/content/krishi-vigyan-kendra}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another lists 676.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KVK Dashboard|url=https://kvk.icar.gov.in/dashboard.aspx|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first KVK was established in 1974 in [[Pondicherry]]. Since then, KVKs have been established in all states, and the number continues to grow. The Indian agricultural landscape faces many challenges, including a high percentage of smallholder farmers, lack of supply chain infrastructure, and extreme weather conditions. For a full description of these challenges, see [[Agriculture in India#Problems|Agriculture in India]]. A key strategy in addressing these issues, in addition to policy support and a functioning market, is using technology to better understand and adapt to complex challenges. However, higher-level research about modern agricultural trends, such as [[Climate Change]] and [[GMO]], takes place in universities. The practical implications of this research, or their relevance to a certain local context, are not readily apparent. For example, academic research on new crop practices or seed types often takes place in centralized testing locations, due to the ease of monitoring and evaluation. The same goes for ground-level innovations which are effective in one local context but may not be extensible to others. Especially in areas with such geographic complexity as India, agricultural extension departments such as KVKs serve to gather, test and disseminate knowledge between centralized institutions and a geographically-dispersed rural population.

In this mandate, the effectiveness of KVKs is difficult to measure, due to large number of farmers served by a single KVK and largely off-line communication between the KVK and farmers. For this reason, research over the past 20 years has focused on the capacity of KVKs to make use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] for the purpose of better managing their communications with farmers. An plethora of applications have been developed, sharing advisories such as weather information and market pricing, supplementing the KVK's communication with its beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saravanan|first1=Raj|title=Mobile Phone Applications for Agricultural Extension in India|url=http://www.fao.org/e-agriculture/sites/default/files/uploads/kb/2015/03/mextension_india_saravanan_raj_.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=10 May 2018|agency=FAO}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these initiatives are short-lasted, or have limited impact, since the teams at each KVK often do not have the capacity to maintain software applications or because farmers do not find the information useful.

While KVKs are expected to undertake their own projects, they are also expected to serve as a resource center for extending government initiatives to local areas. The current national government's program "Doubling Farmers' Income by 2022" calls for increases in agricultural productivity, development initiatives such as [[Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana]] and [[Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana]] as well as more focus on technological innovation. The government expects KVKs to aid in the dissemination of information and practices regarding these new government initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chand|first1=Ramesh|title=NITI Policy Paper No.1/2017 : Doubling of Farmers income Rationale, Strategy Prospects and Action Plan|url=http://agricoop.nic.in/sites/default/files/NITI%20Aayog%20Policy%20Paper.pdf|format=PDF|website=National Informatics Center (India)|accessdate=10 May 2018|page=21|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PM Modi: Target to double farmers’ income by 2022|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/farmers-rally-bareilly-target-to-double-farmers-income-by-2022/|website=Indianexpress.com|accessdate=10 May 2018|date=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=10th National Conference of KVK’s 2018 concludes|url=https://icar.org.in/content/10th-national-conference-kvk%E2%80%99s-2018-concludes|website=Icar.org.in|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to KVKs, there are many local institutions which also interface directly with farmers, such as the [[Agricultural produce market committee]] and the Agricultural Engineering Department. As of October 2018, there is an online dashboard which provides updates on the activity of various KVKs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KVK Dashboard|url=https://kvk.icar.gov.in/dashboard.aspx|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
A KVK can be formed under a variety of host institutions, including agricultural universities, state departments, ICAR institutes, other educational instiutions, or NGOs. The 700 KVKs in operation per the ICAR website are split into: 458 under State Agricultural Universities, 18 under Central Agricultural Universities, 64 under ICAR institutes, 105 under NGOs, 39 under state departments or other public sector undertakings, and 16 under other miscellaneous educational institutions.&lt;ref name="ICAR_KVK_info" /&gt; A KVK must own about 20 [[hectare]] of land for the purpose of testing new agricultural technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.icar.org.in/files/CriteriaforSelectionandEstablishmentofKVK.pdf | format=PDF | title=Criteria for selection and establishment | website=Icar.org.in | accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibilities ==
'''On-Farm Testing:''' Each KVK operates a small farm to test new technologies, such as seed varieties or innovative farming methods, developed by ICAR institutes. This allows new technologies to be tested at the local level before being transferred to farmers.

'''Front-line Demonstration:''' Due to the KVK's farm and its proximity to nearby villages, it organizes programs to show the efficacy of new technologies on farmer fields.

'''Capacity Building:''' In addition to demonstrating new technologies, the KVK also hosts capacity building exercises and workshops to discuss modern farming techniques with groups of farmers.

'''Multi-sector Support:''' Offer support to various private and public initiatives through its local network and expertise. It is very common for government research institutes to leverage the network of KVKs when performing surveys with a wide range of farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iari.res.in/files/Extension_events/MGMG_VOStrengthening-28022017.pdf|format=PDF|title=Strengthening Agricultural Extension Activities through IARI Partnership with KVK, Muradnagar and NGO, Foundation for Agricultural Resources Management and Environmental Remediation (FARMER) in Ghaziabad district, UP|website=Iara.res.in|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iivr.org.in/icar-iivr-varanasi-hosts-partners-private-seed-company-during-brinjal-chilli-day.html|title=ICAR-IIVR, Varanasi hosts partners from private seed company during Brinjal-Chilli Day - ICAR-Indian Institute of Vegetable Research|website=Iivr.org.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcri.org/neh.html|title=ICAR-Central Tuber Crops Research Institute - Services|website=Ctcri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advisory Services:''' Due to the growing use of [[information and communications technology|ICT]], KVKs have implemented technologies to provide farmers information, such as weather advisories or market pricing, through radio and mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icar.gov.in/content/agricultural_extension_division |title=Agricultural Extension Division &amp;#124; भारतीय कृषि अनुसंधान परिषद |website=Icar.gov.in |date=2017-02-23 |accessdate=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of these activities, the KVK focuses on crops and methods specific to the local climate and industry. Some factors which may impact this decision are: soil type, crops grown, water availability, seasonal temperatures, and allied sectors such as dairy and [[aquaculture]]. In addition to addressing local factors, KVKs are also mandated to increase adoption of practices that align with renumerative agriculture, [[climate change|climate smart agriculture]], and dietary diversification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eeslindia.org/writereaddata/05%20Krishi%20Vigyan%20Kendra%20(KVK).pdf|format=PDF|title=Role of KVK system in Agricultural Extension Programmes|website=Eeslindia.org|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some KVKs also host social activities to facilitate rapport between the institutions and the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvkdharwad.org/publications/23.%20KVK%20News%20Letter%20April-June%202017.pdf|format=PDF|title=Newsletter|website=Kvkdharwad.org|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10876">'''Lucy Randolph Mason''' (26 July 1882– 6 May1959) was a 20th-century American labor activist and suffragette.  She was involved in the union movement, the [[Consumer activism|consumer movement]] and the [[civil rights movement]] in the mid-20th century.

==Early life==

Lucy Randolph Mason was born on the [[Clarens (Alexandria, Virginia)|Clarens]] estate in Virginia near [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] July 26, 1882 and grew up near [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/mason-lucy-randolph|title=Mason, Lucy Randolph|date=2012-05-22|work=Episcopal Church|access-date=2018-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mason was one of five children born to Episcopal minister Landon Mason and his wife Lucy Ambler Mason.  She was a fifth-generation descendant of [[George Mason]], author of the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] which was the model for the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason was also related to [[John Marshall]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] (her father's second cousin).

Growing up in the Episcopal church with a clergyman father and devoted mother developed strong social convictions in Lucy and her siblings. After high school, Mason taught herself stenography while teaching Sunday school classes. It was during this time that she began to be interested in women's rights, specifically voting rights, working towards improving conditions for working people and ending racial injustice, specifically in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Career==
During her 20s while supporting herself as a stenographer, she devoted her free time to volunteer social service work and the suffragette movement.  In 1914 the Richmond [[YWCA USA|YWCA]] offered her a job as its industrial secretary, which she stayed on as until 1918.  In 1918, Mason's mother passed away and she was forced to quit in order to be able to care for her ailing father.  During the years that Mason cared for her father she continued to volunteer for the Union Label League and served as president of both the Richmond Equal Suffrage League and the Richmond League of Women Voters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1923, Mason's father passed and she returned to the YWCA as the general secretary and remained there until 1932.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Mason_Lucy_Randolph_1882-1959#start_entry|title=Mason, Lucy Randolph (1882–1959)|website=www.encyclopediavirginia.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her time as general secretary she developed a range of innovative programs that were aimed at training and the economic advancement in the lives of both white and black young women and workers in general.  With the YWCA Mason generated public support for state labor laws that ensure safe workplaces, end [[Child labour|child labor]], raise [[Minimum wage|minimum wages]], and shorten work hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mason also traveled throughout the South during this time promoting voluntary employment agreements that incorporated fair labor standards.  To aid this effort she wrote a pamphlet ''Standards for Workers in Southern Industry'' (1931), which was the first pamphlet of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

She belonged to the [[Union Label Department, AFL-CIO|Union Label League]] in Richmond and was a frequent speaker to community and labor groups about the importance of buying union made products and services. During World War I, [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) President, [[Samuel Gompers|Samuel Gompers,]] appointed Mason as the Virginia chairwoman of the [[Women in Industry Committee]], a division of the wartime [[National Advisory Committee on Labor]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/mason-lucy-randolph-1882-1959|title=Mason, Lucy Randolph (1882–1959) {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was so successful in her ventures during this time that she drew the interest of other female reformers, [[Florence Kelley|Florence Kelly]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt|First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt]].  Mason made such an impression that Kelly chose her as successor for her role as secretary of the National Consumers League (NCL).  In 1932 she was appointed as General Secretary to the NCL, and moved to New York, where she lived for five years; working closely with social workers and recruiting staff for relief and welfare agencies created under the [[New Deal]].  It was during this period she met and impressed Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom she was friends with for the rest of their lives.

From the 1900s to the 1930s, the NCL worked to pass protective labor laws and to convince consumers to buy only goods and services produced by workers who enjoyed a living wage and decent working conditions. Under Mason, the NCL won the passage of new state labor laws, lobbied for improved labor codes in the 1933 [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] and helped ensure the passage of the 1938 [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=49, 55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The South and the CIO ===

In 1937, during congressional hearings on the FLSA, Mason met [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) President, [[John L. Lewis]], who helped arrange a job for her as the CIO's public relations representative for the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1937, at age 55, Mason moved to Atlanta and started working at the Textile Workers Organizing Committee offices and became the CIO's "roving ambassador" for the next 16 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Mason, the CIO was "a training ground for citizenship" for Southern workers, a vehicle "to bring democracy to the South" and the means to alleviate the economic and racial injustices experienced by minorities and the poor. Mason traveled alone to small towns where union organizers and their sympathizers had been shot, beaten, threatened and jailed. She cornered hostile sheriffs, judges, newspaper editors, politicians and ministers, explaining workers' rights to organize and bargain under the new federal statutes and promoting an understanding of the need for unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mason|1952|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was known by friend and foe as "Miss Lucy". Her social status as a Southern lady and the daughter of an old, respected Virginia family often gained her access to political and community leaders when others were denied. &lt;blockquote&gt;You can't get much kosher than that in Virginia, but she kind of had an interest in working people that most people of that kind of background don't have...Boy, she was a power.  We would all yell for Lucy anytime that we needed help and she would come into the toughest situations and was great.  She played a tremendous role, a tremendous role. - [[Myles Horton]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Miss Lucy's success also rested on her blunt speech, her calm yet steely demeanor and her ability to bring civil liberties violations to the attention of federal officials, including President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. For example, Mason convinced Roosevelt to send a special federal investigator to Memphis in 1940 in the wake of physical attacks on the United Rubber Workers' organizers who were trying to create an interracial union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1944, Mason worked with the CIO Political Action Committee ("[[CIO-PAC]]") in the South, helping to register union members, black and white, and working for the elimination of the [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]. She also forged lasting links between labor and religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helped get the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] to adopt a resolution in 1938 recognizing "the right of labor to organize and engage in collective bargaining to the end that labor may have a fair and living wage, such as will provide not only the necessities of life, but for recreation, pleasure, and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salmond|1988|pp=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, she organized interfaith, multi-union and interracial groups in Atlanta and other Southern cities of workers dedicated to building bridges between organized labor and the churches. Eventually, these local groups formed the National Religion and Labor Foundation. Mason was dedicated to ending white supremacy in the South, where she was a founding member of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare and she was a frequent speaker at interracial gatherings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1952, Lucy Randolph Mason's autobiography was published called ''To Win These RIghts,'' which contained an introduction written but her close friend, Eleanor Roosevelt.  Then, in 1953, Mason retired from the CIO due to declining health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

In 1953, due to ill health, Mason retired from active union work. Then, in 1959, she passed away in a nursing home in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''[http://www.ecw.org/prod/186-1.pdf A Discussion and Critique of Market Transformation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524193327/http://www.ecw.org/prod/186-1.pdf |date=2010-05-24 }}, Review 186-1. Energy Center of Wisconsin, June 1999&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the value and self-sustaining presence of [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] technologies in the marketplace. It is a strategic process of market intervention which aims to alter market behavior by removing identified barriers and leveraging opportunities to further the internalization of cost-effective energy efficiency as a matter of standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aceee.org/topics/market-transformation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imt.org/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://neea.org/docs/marketing-tookits/neea_definition_of_markettransformation.pdf?sfvrsn=0 Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, ''NEEA's Definition of Market Transformation''.]&lt;/ref&gt; Market transformation has rapidly become the objective of many privately and publicly supported energy efficiency programs in the United States and other countries.

== Background ==

First coined in a paper presented at the [[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy|ACEEE]] Summer Study in 1992,&lt;ref name="Qualenergia"&gt;Nadel, Thorne, Sacks, Prindle, Elliott. ''[http://www.qualenergia.it/UserFiles/Files/Ef_Ge_01_Market_transformation_2003.pdf Market Transformation: Substantial Progress from a Decade of Work]'' American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "market transformation" is underpinned by the classic [[Economics#Markets|microeconomic model of markets]], which describes a downward-sloping demand curve and an upward-sloping, presumably short-run supply curve.&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;[http://www.energy.ca.gov/papers/2002-08-18_aceee_presentations/PANEL-06_WOODS.PDF California Energy Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; In the energy efficiency market, however, standard price and quantity equilibria are often rendered inefficient because of structural [[barriers to entry|market barriers]] like split incentives, asymmetric information, distorted market power, and hassle costs.
&lt;ref name="Qualenergia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CEC"/&gt; Market transformation targets these barriers to optimal efficiency with strategies to shift entire market sectors into a more efficient product mix.

While it recognizes and harnesses the power of market forces and players, market transformation has also been conceptualized as a holistic, market-based [[marketing strategy]], building on the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory through a strategic framework for justifying market intervention.&lt;ref name="ECW"/&gt;

== Implementation ==

Contrary to traditional energy efficiency strategies, which often focus on small-scale [[procurement]] and installation of efficient products, the goal of market transformation is to produce new patterns of "business as usual" for all actors in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmarket.net/market_transformation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724092510/http://www.tecmarket.net/market_transformation.htm |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Programs act on market inefficiencies by removing quantity or price constraints, or by lowering [[Transaction cost|transaction and uncertainty costs]].&lt;ref name="CEC"/&gt; Market transformation program strategies can resemble [[demand side management]] (DSM)  as well as supplier innovation interventions, but with the added goal of long-term energy savings and changing standard business practices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2915">'''Minimum wage in Croatia''' is regulated by the Minimum Wage Act ({{lang-hr|Zakon o minimalnoj plaći}}) and is defined as the lowest gross monthly wage for a [[full-time]] worker, based on a 40-hour work week.{{sfn|Minimum Wage Act|loc=§2}}{{sfn|Bejaković|2015|p=24}} For workers who do not work full time, minimum wage is lower, in proportion to their [[working time|working hours]].{{sfn|Minimum Wage Act|loc=§2}} Additional compensation for [[overtime]] work, night work, and work on Sundays and holidays is not included in the minimum wage.{{sfn|Minimum Wage Act|loc=§2}} Minimum wage is recalculated once a year and is effective throughout the next calendar year.{{sfn|Minimum Wage Act|loc=§4}}

As of 1 January 2018, the minimum gross monthly wage in Croatia is 3,439 [[Croatian kuna|HRK]] (c.&amp;nbsp;€460), which is equivalent to a net amount of 2,752 HRK (c.&amp;nbsp;€370), or 43% of average monthly wage.&lt;ref name="HRT"/&gt; In January 2018, minimum wage was received by 45,245 workers,&lt;ref name="VL"/&gt; down from c.&amp;nbsp;80,000 in 2014.&lt;ref name="JL"/&gt;

The '''National Nanotechnology Initiative''' is a [[United States]] federal government program for the [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[technology]] [[research and development]] for [[nanoscale]] projects. “The NNI serves as the central point of communication, cooperation, and collaboration for all Federal agencies engaged in nanotechnology research, bringing together the expertise needed to advance this broad and complex field.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the NNI {{!}} Nano|url=http://nano.gov/about-nni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiative participants (cited below) state that its four goals are to

# advance a world-class nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D) program;
# foster the transfer of new technologies into products for commercial and public benefit;
# develop and sustain educational resources, a skilled workforce, and the supporting infrastructure and tools to advance nanotechnology; and
# support responsible development of nanotechnology.

== History ==

[[Mihail C. Roco]] proposed the initiative in a 1999 presentation to the White House in the Clinton administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/eng/staff/mroco.jsp Dr. Mihail C. Roco: Senior Advisor for Nanotechnology, National Science Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411141651/https://www.nsf.gov/eng/staff/mroco.jsp |date=11 April 2010 }} at NSF Directorate of Engineering website&lt;/ref&gt;; &lt;ref&gt; M.C.

Tonn, and G. Whitesides. Convergence of Knowledge, Technology, and Society:

President [[Bill Clinton]] advocated [[nanotechnology]] development. In a 21 January 2000 speech [http://pr.caltech.edu/events/presidential_speech/] at the [[California Institute of Technology]], Clinton stated that "Some of our research goals may take twenty or more years to achieve, but that is precisely why there is an important role for the federal government."

President [[George W. Bush]] further increased funding for nanotechnology.  On December 3, 2003 Bush [[signed into law]] the '''21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act''' (Public Law 108-153 [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ153.108]), which authorizes expenditures for five of the participating agencies totaling $3.63 billion over four years.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927072326/http://www.nano.gov/html/res/Sen.AllenNational_Nanotechnology_Initiative_Conference_4.1.04.htm].  This law is an [[authorization]], not an [[Appropriation (law)|appropriation]], and subsequent appropriations for these five agencies have not met the goals set out in the 2003 Act. However, there are many agencies involved in the Initiative that are not covered by the Act, and requested budgets under the Initiative for all participating agencies in Fiscal Years 2006 - 2015 totaled over $1 billion each.

In February 2014, the National Nanotechnology Initiative released a Strategic Plan outlining updated goals and "program component areas" [http://nano.gov/sites/default/files/pub_resource/2014_nni_strategic_plan.pdf]," as required under the terms of the Act. This document supersedes the NNI Strategic Plans released in 2004 and 2007.

The NNI's budget supplement proposed by the Obama administration for Fiscal Year 2015 provides $1.5 billion in requested funding. The cumulative NNI investment since fiscal year 2001, including the 2015 request, totals almost $21 billion. Cumulative investments in nanotechnology-related environmental, health, and safety research since 2005 now total nearly $900 million. The Federal agencies with the largest investments are the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nano.gov/2015BudgetSupplement NNI Supplement to the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Voter Registration Act of 1993''' (NVRA) ({{usc|52|20501|20511}}) (formerly {{usc|42|1973gg|1973gg-10}}), also known as the '''Motor Voter Act''', is a United States federal law signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on May 20, 1993, and which came into effect on January 1, 1995. The law was enacted under the [[Elections Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]]. The law advances [[voting rights]] in the United States by requiring [[U.S. state|state governments]] to offer [[voter registration in the United States|voter registration]] opportunities to any eligible person who applies for or renews a [[driver license]] or applies for [[Public assistance|public assistance]] along with requiring the [[United States Postal Service]] to [[mail]] election materials of a state as if the state is a [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]].&lt;ref&gt;https://pe.usps.com/text/pub417/pub417_ch2_004.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The law requires states to register applicants that use a federal voter registration form to apply and prohibits states from removing registered voters from the voter rolls unless certain criteria are met.

The Act exempts from its requirements the states that have continuously, since March 11, 1993, not required voter registration for federal elections or that have offered Election Day voter registration (EDR) for federal general elections. Six states qualify for exemption from the Act: [[North Dakota]] (which does not require registration), [[Idaho]], [[Minnesota]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Wisconsin]] and [[Wyoming]]. [[Maine]] lost the exemption when it abolished EDR in 2011, although EDR was subsequently restored in that state.

==Background==
After Congress enacted the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to address rampant voting discrimination against racial minorities, voting rights advocates argued for federal legislation to remove other barriers to [[voter registration in the United States]]. The basic requirements to vote are the same in all states. A person has to be a U.S. citizen, of at least 18 years old and a resident of the state in which he or she is voting. However, initial legislative efforts to create national voter registration standards for federal elections failed. In the early 1970s, Congress considered several legislative proposals to require the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] to mail voter registration forms to every household, none of which passed. In the mid and late 1970s, legislative proposals to require certain public agency offices to make voter registration forms available and to require states to allow [[Election Day voter registration]] failed. Similar bills introduced throughout the 1980s also failed.&lt;ref name=CRS&gt;{{CRS|last=Crocker |first=Royce |date=September 8, 2013| article=The National Voter Registration Act of 1993: History, Implementation, and Effects| url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40609.pdf |daet=September 18, 2013 |format=PDF |accessdate=&lt;!--wrong way do to this, but here gets different style and can't figure out to do consistent--&gt;}} Retrieved June 8, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

Congress passed two pieces of legislation in the 1980s that made voter registration for federal elections more accessible for certain disadvantaged populations. In 1984, Congress passed the [[Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act]], which requires that states make available to elderly and handicapped voters "a reasonable number of  accessible permanent registration facilities" and registration aids. Congress also passed the [[Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act]] (1986), requiring states to mail federal voter registration forms to overseas and military voters and permit them to register by mail.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;{{rp|2}}

In light of low voter turnout in federal elections throughout the 1980s, Congress returned its attention to creating general voter registration standards in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Members of Congress introduced a series of "motor voter" bills that would require state motor vehicle agencies to offer voter registration opportunities to clients applying for driver's licenses. The first of these bills, the proposed National Voter Registration Act of 1989, passed in the House of Representatives with bipartisan support, but it stalled in the Senate. A similar bill, the proposed National Voter Registration Act of 1991, gained less bipartisan support; it passed in both the Senate and the House, but it was vetoed by President [[George H.W. Bush]]. Two years later, Congress passed a nearly identical bill: the National Voter Registration Act of 1993.&lt;ref name=CRS /&gt;{{rp|2–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gemmiti|first1=Nathan V.|title=Porsche or Pinto?

In March 1991, the American rock band [[R.E.M.]] placed a mail-away petition in support of the act on the back of the [[longbox]] of their album ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' and encouraged their fans to fill them out and mail them to [[Rock the Vote]].&lt;ref name="rem1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Whitney|title=Why R.E.M.’s Out of Time Is the Most Politically Significant Album in U.S. History|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2014/07/25/roman_mars_99_percent_invisible_r_e_m_s_out_of_time_is_the_most_politically.html|website=Slate|accessdate=30 December 2016|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock the Vote received over 100,000 such petitions from the band's fans, and subsequently delivered them to the United States Senate in April 1991.&lt;ref name="rem1"/&gt; The band's campaign has been credited with raising significant public awareness and support of the act before it was signed into law.&lt;ref name="rem1"/&gt;

==Provisions==

===Purposes===
The purposes of the Act are set out in Section 2:

* to increase the number of registered voters,
* to enhance voter participation,
* to protect election integrity, and
* to ensure states maintain accurate voter roll.&lt;ref name="at15"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.projectvote.org/images/publications/NVRA/THE%20NVRA%20at%20FIFTEEN--A%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf|title = The National Voter Registration Act at Fifteen|date = 2009|accessdate = June 2, 2014|website = |publisher = Project Vote|last = Rogers|first = Estelle H.|format = PDF}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name=NVRA-purposes&gt;{{usc|52|20501|pipe=National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C § 20501(b))}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scope and exemption===
The Act formally applies only to federal elections. However, because states have unified their voter registration systems for state and federal elections, the provisions functionally apply to both state and federal elections.&lt;ref name="at15" /&gt;{{rp|5–6}}

The Act exempts from its requirements states that have continuously, since March 11, 1993, not required voter registration for federal elections or that have offered Election Day voter registration for federal general elections. Six states satisfy these exemption requirements: North Dakota is exempt for having continuously allowed its residents to vote in federal elections without registering, while Idaho, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Wyoming have continuously offered Election Day voter registration for federal general elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://groups.law.gwu.edu/LR/ArticlePDF/78-2-Shordt.pdf|title = Not Registered to Vote?

===Voter registration of driver's license applicants===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
Section 5 requires state motor vehicle offices to provide voter registration opportunities to anyone applying for a new or renewed driver's license or state identification card.
The Act reduces costs of voting registration by accumulating individual data when applying for a drivers license or receiving social assistance.&lt;ref name=Wolfinger&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Registering and Voting with Motor Voter |first=Raymond E. |last=Wolfinger |first2=Jonathan |last2=Hoffman |journal=Political Science and Politics |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=March 2001 |pages=85–92 |publisher=American Political Science Association |jstor=1350315 |doi=10.1017/s1049096501000130 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "motor voter" nickname came from the idea that most of the NVRA data was accumulated from applicants renewing or obtaining driver's licenses.&lt;ref name=Wolfinger /&gt;

===Voter registration agencies===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
Section 7 requires state agencies that provide public assistance{{snd}}including those that administer federal assistance programs such as food stamps, Medicaid, TANF, and WIC, and disability offices{{snd}}to assist their applicants and clients in registering to vote during the application process.&lt;ref name=Delgado/&gt;

The [[Federal Voting Assistance Program]] (FVAP) is responsible for administering NVRA for U.S. citizens abroad. FVAP allows eligible citizens to register to vote at 6000 Armed Forces Recruitment Offices nationwide.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Mail voter registration===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
Section 6 allows for more accessible voter registration through mail voter registration.

In 2004, the Nu Mu Lambda chapter of [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] fraternity held a [[Voter registration campaign|voter registration drive]] in [[DeKalb County, Georgia]], from which [[Secretary of State of Georgia|Georgia Secretary of State]] [[Cathy Cox]] (Dem.) rejected all 63 voter registration applications on the basis that the fraternity did not follow correct procedures, including obtaining specific pre-clearance from the state to conduct their drive.  Nu Mu Lambda filed ''[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-11th-circuit/1062271.html Charles H. Wesley Education Foundation v. Cathy Cox]'' (''Wesley v. Cox'') on the basis that Georgia's long-standing policy and practice of rejecting mail-in voter registration applications that were submitted in bundles, by persons other than registrars, deputy registrars, or "authorized persons", violated the requirements of the National Voter Registration Act by undermining voter registration drives.  A senior [[United States federal judge|U.S. District Judge]] upheld earlier federal court decisions in the case, which also found private entities have a right, under the federal law, to engage in organized voter registration activity in Georgia at times and locations of their choosing, without the presence or permission of state or local election officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/news/0034.html |title=Cox Violated Voter Rights, Judge Declares |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829032217/http://www.atlantaprogressivenews.com/news/0034.html |archivedate=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal voter registration form===
The Act requires States to "accept and use" a uniform federal form to register voters for federal elections.&lt;ref&gt;42 U.S.C. §1973gg–4(a)(1).&lt;/ref&gt; The National Mail Voter Registration Form (commonly referred to as the "Federal Form") was developed by the federal [[Election Assistance Commission]] (EAC), and requires only that an applicant affirm, under penalty of perjury, various matters including that he or she is a citizen. (The Federal Form can be used as an alternative to any state form.)

Arizona, however, requires voter-registration officials to "reject" any application for registration, including a Federal Form, that is not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship. A group of Arizona residents and a group of nonprofit organizations challenged the Arizona law in court. Ultimately, the District Court granted Arizona summary judgment on the respondents' claim that the federal Act preempts Arizona’s requirement. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the state's documentary-proof-of-citizenship requirement is preempted by the federal Act.&lt;ref name="supremecourt"&gt;{{citation-attribution|now=n|https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-71_7l48.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 17, 2013, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled against Arizona in ''[[Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc.]]'', holding that the federal Act preempted a 2004 Arizona proposition, [[Arizona Proposition 200 (2004)]], which was a ballot initiative designed in part "to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to present proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to present identification when they vote on election day."&lt;ref&gt;''Purcell v. Gonzalez'', 549 U.S. 1, 2 (2006) (per curiam).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 7–2 decision the Court struck down the state law. Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] wrote the majority opinion, holding that the State requirements were pre-empted by the federal law, which mandates states to "accept and use" the Federal Form. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.&lt;ref name="supremecourt" /&gt;

==Impact==
Voting rights organizations argue that some states have not been complying with the National Voter Registration Act. In several states, organizations such as [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]], [[Project Vote]], [[Campaign Legal Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/08/attorneys-suspect-tens-thousands-nevadans-wrongly-stripped-right-vote/405258002/|title=Attorneys suspect tens of thousands of Nevadans wrongly stripped of right to vote|work=Reno Gazette Journal|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law]] have filed lawsuits or sent pre-litigation letters.

'''Nikolai Ivanovich Kibalchich''' ({{lang-ru|Николай Иванович Кибальчич}}, {{lang-uk|Микола Іванович Кибальчич}}, ''Mykola Ivanovych Kybalchych''; 19 October 1853 – April 3, 1881) was a Russian revolutionary of Ukrainian origin who took part in the assassination of Tsar Alexander II as the main [[explosive]] expert for [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] (the People's Will), and was also a [[rocket]] pioneer. He was the paternal uncle of revolutionary [[Victor Serge]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Korop]], [[Chernigov Governorate]] (present [[Ukraine]]) in 1853 into a clerical family,&lt;ref name="Laszslo Solymar2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Solymar |first=Laszslo |date=21 November 2013 |title=Anatomy of Assassinations: from biblical times to the end of the second millennium |url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=qeEyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=Nikolai+Rysakov+born&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=[[Author House]] |page=115 |isbn=978-1-491-88182-8 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kibalchich was the son of an Orthodox parish [[priest]].&lt;ref name="Russia IC2008" /&gt; He entered a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in 1864 but was later admitted to a seminary. But he returned to secondary school and finishing it with a silver medal several years later.&lt;ref name="Russia IC2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/education_science/gems/728/#.Wb5uSr2wrqA|title=Nikolai Kibalchich - Science for Terrorism|date=10 April 2008|publisher=Russia IC}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied medicine and later engineering at the '''Saint Petersburg Engineering College'''&lt;ref name="Laszslo Solymar2013" /&gt; and worked on experiments into pulsed [[rocket]] propulsion.

==Biography==
In October 1875, Kibalchich was arrested for lending a prohibited book to a peasant. He spent 3 years in prison&lt;ref name="Russia IC2008" /&gt; before being sentenced to 2 months imprisonment.

He went on to join [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]] in 1878,&lt;ref name="Russia IC2008" /&gt; becoming their main explosives expert.&lt;ref name="Russia IC2008" /&gt; In March 1881, he was charged with taking part in the assassination of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].

All through the night from February 28 to March 1, Mykolaj and his assistants - the Fleet Lieutenant Sukhnanov and Mikhail Grachvesky – worked without rest preparing the missile shells. The Peoples Will members had to be quick. Andrei Zhelyabov, who was to direct the missile throwers in an attempt on the life of the Emperor Alexander II, had been arrested on 27 February. If the Tsar survived the explosion, Zhelyabov was to kill him with a dagger. Zhelyabov’s arrest on the eve of the assassination attempt came as a complete surprise, although alarming rumors had appeared in February that the police were up to something. The plan was in jeopardy. There was no one to warn the Narodnaya-Volya people. Nikolai Kletochnikov, assistant to the file clerk of the Third (Security) Department, bearer of a Saint Stanislav Order, who had often warned the Narodniks about the gathering dangers, had been arrested at the end of January.

By the morning of March 1 four projectiles were ready. One of them killed Alexander II on March 1, 1881, on the embankment of the Yekaterininsky Canal in Saint Petersburg. Kibalchich was arrested on March 17.

"When his men came to see Kibalchich as his appointed counsel for the defense," said V.N Gerard in his statement to the special committee of the senate, "I was surprised above all by the fact that his mind was occupied with completely different things with no bearing on the present trial. He seems to be immersed in research on some aeronautic missile; he thirsted for a possibility to write down his mathematical calculations involved in the discovery. He wrote them down and submitted them to the authorities."
[[Image:Execution Nikolai Kibalchich.jpg|thumb|300px|Mykolaj Kybalchych being executed with other revolutionaries]]
In a note written in his prison cell, Kibalchich proposed a manned jet air-navigating apparatus. He examined the design of powder rocket engine, controlling the flight by changing engines angle, the pro note is dated March 23. He produced this scientific work truly at death's door.

On March 26, General Komarov, Chief of the Gendarmery Department, informed the Police Department: "Pursuant to the request from Nikolai Kibalchich, the son of the priest, who is accused of high treason, I have the honor to present hereby his design of an aeronautic device."

The brief written in the report said: "To be filed with the March 1 dossier and to give this to 
scientists for consideration now would hardly be expedient since this can only give rise to a lot of wanton talk. Kibalchich’s design was put in an envelope, sealed and filed. The inventor was told that his design would be handed over to scientists for examination.

Kibalchich awaited for their answer. The month of March was at an end, with two days left before execution. On March 31 Kibalchich wrote this solicitation address to the Minister of Interior: “By instruction of your Excellency my design of an aeronautic apparatus has been submitted for the consideration of technical committee; could your Excellency direct that I be allowed to meet with any of the committee members on the matter of this design not later than tomorrow morning or at least to receive a written answer from the experts who have examined my design, also no longer than tomorrow.

I also ask your Excellency for permission for me, before I die, to meet with all my comrades
in the trial or at least with Zhelyabov and Perovskaya." All the requests were ignored.

==Execution and legacy==

At 7:50 am on the sunny spring morning of April 3 two “chariots of shame” with the 
condemned prisoners rode out of the house of the detention to Shpalernaya Street. Zhelyabov was 
in the first, and by his side was Rysakov, who had tossed the first bomb at the coach of 
Alexander II and then betrayed his comrades during the interrogation. Kibalchich, Perovskaya and Mikhailov were in the second. The hands and feet of the condemned were tied to the seats. Each had on his chest a black plaque with the white colored inscription: “A regicide”.

At 9:21 am the executioner removed the foot stool from under the feet of Kibalchich. Mikhailov, Perovskaya, Zhelyabov and Rysakov were executed after him.

Thus, Kybalchych and other Narodnaya Volya plotters including [[Sophia Perovskaya]], [[Andrei Zhelyabov]], [[Nikolai Rysakov]] and [[Timofei Mikhailov]] were hanged on April 3, 1881.

The fate of the invention, mentioned in Kybalchych's last letter, proved to be as tragic as that of its 27-year-old creator. Kibalchich’s 
design was buried in the archives of Police Department, but the tsar authorities failed to consign 
the name of the inventor and his idea to oblivion. The trial and execution of the Narodniks had wide 
repercussions around the world. Much was said and written about Kibalchich’s design abroad and all
kinds of conjectures were made about the essence of the invention and its subsequent fate. In 1917, [[Nikolai Rynin]] rediscovered the manuscript in the archives and published an account of it 1918 in the historic magazine ''[[Byloye]]'' (Былое, ''The Past'').

In 1891, similar ideas were developed independently by the German engineer [[Hermann Ganswindt]]. After WWII, [[Stanislaw Ulam]] proposed a nuclear pulse propulsion scheme which was studied in [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project ORION]].

The [[IAU|International Astronomical Union]] honoured the rocketry pioneer by naming a crater on the moon Kibalchich's crater(Kibal'chich). Located at 3.0° N 146.5° W, the Moon's far side.

==Final letter==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2009}}
'''The Dream of a propulsive device by a Scientist that was stolen by death'''

"I, Nikolai Kibalchich, am writing down this design in prison with several days to go before my 
execution. I believed in the practicability of my idea and this belief sustains me in my appalling situation by scientists and specialists who show my idea to be practicable, I will feel happy in the knowledge that I have rendered an immense service to my country and mankind.  I will then calmly meet death, knowing that my idea will not die with me but will remain with mankind for which I prepared to sacrifice my life. That is why I pray to those scientists who will examine my design that they treat it with the utmost seriousness and good faith and let me know their answer as soon as possible.

First and foremost I need it necessary to note that, when at large, I did not have time to 
elaborate my design in details and prove its feasibility mathematically. Now it is, of course 
impossible for me to obtain the materials necessary for that. Consequently, this task that of 
substantiating my design with mathematical calculation will have to be done by those experts 
into whose hands my design will find its way.

Besides, I am not familiar with the mass of similar design which have, appeared lately; that is
to say I am aware of the idea behind those designs but I am not familiar with the way whereby the inventors hope to carry them out. As far as I know, however my idea has not yet been proposed by anyone else.

In my thought about an aeronautic machine I have concentrated mainly on this question: what force has to be applied in order to set such machine in motion? In my opinion it is slowly burning explosive substances that can provide such a force.

In fact, the combustion of explosive substance results with a comparative rapidity in large 
quantity of gases possessing a huge energy at the instance of their formation. But can one use 
the energy of gases, formed by explosive ignition, to perform work of any duration? This is 
possible only if the huge energy of explosive combustion, rather than last instantaneously, 
will be generated during a more or less prolonged period of time."

The party's main goal is to abolish [[Nynorsk]] as a written language in schools and the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogg.nrk.no/valgbar/archives/2009/09/sma-og-rare-partier-ett-skrift-sprak.html |title=Små og rare partier: Ett (skrift) språk. |work=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=15 September 2009 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110721153211/http://blogg.nrk.no/valgbar/archives/2009/09/sma-og-rare-partier-ett-skrift-sprak.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it ran for election in [[Akershus]], and received 100 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/krd/html/valg2009/bs5.html|title=Valg 2009 Landsoversikt - Stortingsvalget|publisher=regjeringen.no ([[Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development]])|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 September 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090926023445/http://www.regjeringen.no/krd/html/valg2009/bs5.html|archivedate=26 September 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The party was founded by [[Norwegian language]] teacher Einar Smørdal who had previously proposed such a party in a letter to the local newspaper ''[[Møre (newspaper)|Møre]]'' in [[Volda]]. The party's immediate issue was to end compulsory education in Nynorsk in grade and high school, while making [[Bokmål]] the sole language in public documents was a more long-term goal. The party emphasized that it did not oppose spoken dialects, it was having two parallel written languages which they opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rb.no/Innenriks/Politikk/article4238556.ece|title=Starter parti mot nynorsk|last=Lier|first=Lars|date=April 2, 2009|publisher=Romerikes Blad|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peaceworkers UK''' (PWUK) is part of the Peacebuilding Issues Programme of [[International Alert]]. Previously an independent [[non-governmental organisation]], PWUK became part of International Alert in 2006. PWUK focuses on raising standards in the field of conflict prevention, crisis management and peacebuilding through an integrated programme of research, training, assessment and recruitment. It is led by a Director ([[Timmon Milne-Wallis|Tim Wallis]]) who has a [[PhD]] in [[Peace Studies]] and over 20 years management experience in the field.

==History==
Peaceworkers UK began as an independent research project in 2000 to explore the phenomenon of ‘civilian peace services’ being set up in at least six other European countries. In 2001, it functioned as the secretariat for a Steering Group of other UK-based organisations exploring the feasibility of a UK Civilian Peace Service. The Steering Group, consisting of the organisations listed above, decided in 2002 to set up Peaceworkers UK as an independent entity to pursue these objectives.

==Peaceworker programme==
* Assists organisations to recruit and deploy the best people and expanding the pool of those available for this work through the  PeaceworkersRegister.
* Runs practical, hands-on training courses to help people reach the high standards they need through the PeaceworkersTraining programme.
* Develops and improves those standards and assesses people’s suitability for this work through PeaceworkersSimulations.
* Underpins all this with the latest PeaceworkersResearch into best practices and lessons learned from the field.

===PeaceworkersRegister===
The PeaceworkersRegister is an international database of people suitably qualified and potentially available for a wide range of roles needed in conflict prevention, [[crisis management]] and peacebuilding. Its primary purpose is to help both local and international organisations to find and deploy the best people meeting the highest standards of professional competence in their particular field. As a professional development tool, it also helps those who join it to identify and improve their own skills and qualifications.

===PeaceworkersTraining===
The PeaceworkersTraining programme offers practical, field-based training to prepare people for the many different roles they may play in this field. There are introductory and core skill courses as well as specialised courses in [[human rights]], conflict transformation, human security, and civil society capacity-building. Some of the more specialist courses are run under the auspices of the EU Training Project in Civilian Crisis Management.

===PeaceworkersSimulations===
PeaceworkersSimulations provide a means to assess people against commonly agreed minimum standards of professional competence. Observing people’s responses under simulated field conditions provides the basis for assessments at five levels of competency across a wide range of fieldwork categories.

===PeaceworkersResearch===
The aim of PeaceworkersResearch is to establish a body of knowledge about what has or has not "worked" in different situations of violent conflict. Research activities include field-based personnel assessments and surveys as well as in-house data analysis, tapping into a comprehensive network of individuals and organisations in the field. Why best placed: Peaceworkers UK is best placed to do this work because it has been developing this integrated programme of recruitment, training and assessment for the past five years and has built up an unparalleled understanding of the personal qualities, skills and knowledge needed to work effectively across a range of work categories in this field. It has already begun developing and obtaining wide agreement on a set of appropriate occupational standards together with a tried and tested methodology for training and assessing people against those standards. It has the capacity, the human resources and the know-how to achieve these objectives and is in the strongest possible position to help governments, [[United Nations]] agencies and [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) to make a real difference to the lives of millions unable to escape the causes and consequences of violent conflict in so many parts of the world.

==Partners==
Alert's PeaceworkersUK works with a wide range of partners in the UK and Europe as well as in the rest of the world. Our closest UK partners are [[Saferworld]], Electoral Reform International Services (ERIS), and [[RedR]]. As a member of the [[Peace &amp; Security Liaison Group]] we also work closely with a number of other UK-based organisations working for the prevention, management and resolution of violent conflict around the world.

As a member of the [[European Network of Civil Peace Services]], PWUK also works closely with partner organisations sharing similar aims in ten other European countries. We have partnerships with organisations working directly on their own situations of violent conflict or its aftermath in [[Chechnya]], [[Moldova]], [[Turkey]], [[Croatia]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Outside Europe, PWUK has a special link with the 93 member organisations of the [[Nonviolent Peaceforce]] as well as with a few specific organisations with which we have worked in [[Nepal]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

'''Pennsylvania Leadership Conference''' is an annual two-day conference organized by the Pennsylvania Leadership Council of Pennsylvania conservative activists in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;

The Pennsylvania Leadership Conference was founded in 1989 by a group of conservative activists, including [[Charlie Gerow]], Susan Staub, Jim Panyard, [[Don Eberly]], and John Fluharty, seeking to strengthen the conservative "grassroots lobby" in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{Cite web | title = History of the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference | work = Pennsylvania Leadership Conference | publisher = Pennsylvania Leadership Council | date =  | url = http://www.paleadershipconference.org/about.php | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091216235323/http://www.paleadershipconference.org/about.php | archivedate = 2009-12-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer&gt;{{cite news | last = Eshleman, Jr.| first = Russell E. | title = Harrisburg Conference Promotes Conservative Ideals and Issues | newspaper = Philadelphia Inquirer | location =Philadelphia| publisher = Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. | date = September 17, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first conference attracted 300 attendees and featured speakers including Congressmen [[Robert Smith Walker]] and [[Newt Gingrich]] and State Representatives [[Joseph R.

'''Pi Alpha Alpha''' ('''ΠΑΑ''' or '''PAA''') is the national [[honor society]] for students of [[public administration]]. It is administered by the [[National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration]] in the [[United States]].

The organization was formed to promote excellence in the study and practice of [[public administration]] and [[Public administration|public affairs]]. There are 167 Pi Alpha Alpha chapters,&lt;ref&gt;http://pialphaalpha.org/find-a-chapter/&lt;/ref&gt; with more than 30,000 members.

==Purpose==
"The purpose of Pi Alpha Alpha is to encourage and recognize outstanding scholarship and accomplishment in public affairs and administration. Its objectives, such as fostering integrity, professionalism, and effective performance, promote the advancement of quality in the education and practice of the art and science of public affairs and administration. PAA membership identifies those with the highest performance levels in educational programs preparing them for public service careers."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;http://pialphaalpha.org/about-paa/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Pi Alpha Alpha (PAA) was established in 1974 by [[NASPAA]] under the leadership of the first PAA president Don L. Bowen. This honor society began with the goal to encourage excellence and recognize students who have gone above and beyond in the study of public policy and administration.

{{Computer hacking}}
A '''security hacker''' is someone who seeks to breach defenses and [[Exploit (computer security)|exploit]] weaknesses in a [[Computer|computer system]] or [[computer network|network]]. Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit, protest, information gathering,&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Ira. ''Spies Among Us: How to Stop the Spies, Terrorists, Hackers, and Criminals You Don't Even Know You Encounter Every Day.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2005. pg. 92. {{ISBN|9780764589904}}.&lt;/ref&gt; challenge, recreation,&lt;ref name="crackdown" /&gt; or to evaluate system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is often referred to as the computer underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blomquist|first=Brian|date=May 29, 1999|url=http://archive.nypost.com/a/475198|title=FBI's Web Site Socked as Hackers Target Feds|newspaper=New York Post}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- historical precedent, takes precedence --&gt;

There is a longstanding [[Hacker|controversy]] about the term's true meaning. In this controversy, the term ''hacker'' is reclaimed by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|computer programmers]] who argue that it refers simply to someone with an advanced understanding of computers and computer networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.5.0.dos.txt|title= The Hacker's Dictionary|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and that '''''cracker''''' is the more appropriate term for those who break into computers, whether computer criminal ([[#Black hat|black hats]]) or computer security expert ([[White hat (computer security)|white hats]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://stallman.org/archives/2012-sep-dec.html#06_December_2012_%28Ecuadorian_white_hat_cracker_freed%29 Political notes from 2012: September–December]. stallman.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html |title=Jargon File: Cracker |first=Eric S. |last=Raymond |quote=Coined ca. 1985 by hackers in defense against journalistic misuse of hacker }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 article concluded that "... the black-hat meaning still prevails among the general public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yagoda |first1=Ben |title=A Short History of "Hack"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/a-short-history-of-hack |work=The New Yorker |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{tone inline|date=August 2016}}

==History==
{{Further|Timeline of computer security hacker history}}
[[File:Stering.jpg|thumb|[[Bruce Sterling]], author of ''[[The Hacker Crackdown]]'']]
In computer security, a hacker is someone who focuses on security mechanisms of computer and network systems. While including those who endeavor to strengthen such mechanisms, it is more often used by the [[mass media]] and popular culture to refer to those who seek access despite these security measures. That is, the media portrays the 'hacker' as a villain. Nevertheless, parts of the subculture see their aim in correcting security problems and use the word in a positive sense. White hat is the name given to ethical computer hackers, who utilize hacking in a helpful way. White hats are becoming a necessary part of the information security field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Tracey|title=Ethical hackers: putting on the white hat|journal=Network Security|date=22 July 2011|volume=2011|issue=7|pages=10–13|doi=10.1016/s1353-4858(11)70075-7}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 March 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They operate under a code, which acknowledges that breaking into other people's computers is bad, but that discovering and exploiting security mechanisms and breaking into computers is still an interesting activity that can be done ethically and legally. Accordingly, the term bears strong connotations that are favorable or pejorative, depending on the context.

The subculture around such hackers is termed network hacker subculture, hacker scene, or computer underground. It initially developed in the context of [[phreaking]] during the 1960s and the microcomputer [[Bulletin board system|BBS scene]] of the 1980s. It is implicated with ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]'' and the ''[[alt.2600]]'' newsgroup.

In 1980, an article in the August issue of ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (with commentary by [[Philip Zimbardo]]) used the term "hacker" in its title: "The Hacker Papers". It was an excerpt from a Stanford Bulletin Board discussion on the addictive nature of computer use. In the 1982 film ''[[Tron]]'', Kevin Flynn ([[Jeff Bridges]]) describes his intentions to break into ENCOM's computer system, saying "I've been doing a little hacking here". CLU is the [[software]] he uses for this. By 1983, hacking in the sense of breaking computer security had already been in use as computer jargon,&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.catb.org/jargon/oldversions/jarg1-81-MM-DD.txt 1981 version of the ''Jargon File''], entry "hacker", last meaning.&lt;/ref&gt; but there was no public awareness about such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer hacking: Where did it begin and how did it grow?|publisher=WindowSecurity.com|date=October 16, 2002|url=http://www.windowsecurity.com/whitepapers/Computer_hacking_Where_did_it_begin_and_how_did_it_grow_.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the release of the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that year, featuring a computer intrusion into [[NORAD]], raised the public belief that computer security hackers (especially teenagers) could be a threat to national security. This concern became real when, in the same year, a gang of teenage hackers in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], known as [[The 414s]], broke into computer systems throughout the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], including those of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center|Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] and [[Security Pacific Bank]].&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Elmer-DeWitt|first=Philip|title=The 414 Gang Strikes Again|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|page=75|date=August 29, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949797,00.html|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case quickly grew media attention,&lt;ref name = "drzmzu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=September 27, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 17-year-old Neal Patrick emerged as the spokesman for the gang, including a cover story in ''[[Newsweek]]'' entitled "Beware: Hackers at play", with Patrick's photograph on the cover.&lt;ref name = "iophas"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Beware: Hackers at play|newspaper=Newsweek|pages=42–46, 48|date=September 5, 1983|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Newsweek'' article appears to be the first use of the word ''hacker'' by the mainstream media in the pejorative sense.

Pressured by media coverage, congressman [[Dan Glickman]] called for an investigation and began work on new laws against computer hacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50606-2002Jun26.html|accessdate=2006-04-14|title=Timeline: The U.S. Government and Cybersecurity | date=2003-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"&gt;David Bailey, "Attacks on Computers: Congressional Hearings and Pending Legislation," sp, p. 180, 1984 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
Neal Patrick testified before the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on September 26, 1983, about the dangers of computer hacking, and six bills concerning computer crime were introduced in the House that year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated180"/&gt; As a result of these laws against computer criminality, white hat, [[grey hat]] and black hat hackers try to distinguish themselves from each other, depending on the legality of their activities. These moral conflicts are expressed in [[Loyd Blankenship|The Mentor]]'s "[[The Hacker Manifesto]]", published 1986 in ''[[Phrack]]''.

Use of the term hacker meaning computer criminal was also advanced by the title "Stalking the Wily Hacker", an article by [[Clifford Stoll]] in the May 1988 issue of the ''[[Communications of the ACM]]''. Later that year, the release by [[Robert Tappan Morris, Jr.]] of the so-called [[Morris worm]] provoked the popular media to spread this usage. The popularity of Stoll's book ''[[The Cuckoo's Egg]]'', published one year later, further entrenched the term in the public's consciousness.

==Classifications==
Several subgroups of the computer underground with different attitudes use different terms to demarcate themselves from each other, or try to exclude some specific group with whom they do not agree.

[[Eric S. Raymond]], author of ''[[Jargon File|The New Hacker's Dictionary]]'', advocates that members of the computer underground should be called crackers. Yet, those people see themselves as hackers and even try to include the views of Raymond in what they see as a wider hacker culture, a view that Raymond has harshly rejected. Instead of a hacker/cracker dichotomy, they emphasize a spectrum of different categories, such as [[white hat (computer security)|white hat]], [[grey hat]], [[#Black hat|black hat]] and [[script kiddie]]. In contrast to Raymond, they usually reserve the term ''cracker'' for more malicious activity.

According to Ralph D. Clifford, a ''cracker'' or ''cracking'' is to "gain unauthorized access to a computer in order to commit another crime such as destroying information contained in that system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These subgroups may also be defined by the legal status of their activities.&lt;ref name="hacker hats" /&gt;

===White hat===
{{Main article|White_hat_(computer_security)|l1=White hat}}
A [[white hat (computer security)|white hat hacker]] breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either to test their own security system, perform [[penetration test]]s, or [[vulnerability assessment]]s for a client - or while working for a security company which makes security software. The term is generally synonymous with [[Hacker ethic|ethical hacker]], and the EC-Council,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eccouncil.org/ EC-Council]. eccouncil.org&lt;/ref&gt; among others, have developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking.&lt;ref name="hacker hats"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wilhelm |first=Douglas |title=Professional Penetration Testing |year=2010 |publisher=Syngress Press |isbn=978-1-59749-425-0 |page=503 |chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black hat===
{{Main article|Black hat}}
A "black hat" hacker is a hacker who "violates computer security for little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain" (Moore, 2005).&lt;ref name="Moore2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robert|title=Cybercrime: Investigating High Technology Computer Crime|year=2005|publisher=Matthew Bender &amp; Company|isbn=1-59345-303-5|page=258}}Robert Moore&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Richard Stallman]], to contrast the maliciousness of a criminal hacker versus the spirit of playfulness and exploration in [[hacker culture]], or the ethos of the [[white hat hacker]] who performs hacking duties to identify places to repair or as a means of legitimate employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien, Marakas|first=James, George|title=Management Information Systems |year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill/ Irwin|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-07-752217-9|pages=536–537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black hat hackers form the stereotypical, illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a computer criminal".&lt;ref name="moore2006"&gt;{{cite book

===Grey hat===
{{Main article|Grey hat}}
A grey hat hacker lies between a black hat and a white hat hacker. A grey hat hacker may surf the Internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect, for example. They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee.&lt;ref name="moore2006" /&gt; Grey hat hackers sometimes find the defect of a system and publish the facts to the world instead of a group of people. Even though grey hat hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain, unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and unethical.

===Hacktivist===
A hacktivist is a hacker who utilizes technology to publicize a social, ideological, religious or political message.

[[Hacktivism]] can be divided into two main groups:
* [[Cyberterrorism]]&amp;nbsp;— Activities involving [[website defacement]] or [[denial-of-service attack]]s; and,
* [[Freedom of information]]&amp;nbsp;— Making information that is not public, or is public in non-machine-readable formats, accessible to the public.

==Attacks==
{{Main article|Computer security}}
{{Computer security}}

A typical approach in an attack on Internet-connected system is:
# [[Network enumeration]]: Discovering information about the intended target.
# [[Vulnerability (computing)|Vulnerability analysis]]: Identifying potential ways of attack.
# [[Exploit (computer security)|Exploitation]]: Attempting to compromise the system by employing the vulnerabilities found through the vulnerability analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, Ajay; Klavinsky, Thomas and Laliberte, Scott
(March 15, 2002) [http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=25916 Security Through Penetration Testing: Internet Penetration]. informit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to do so, there are several recurring tools of the trade and techniques used by computer criminals and security experts.

===Security exploits===
{{Main article|Exploit (computer security)}}

A security exploit is a prepared application that takes advantage of a known weakness.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.htbridge.com/publication/the_growing_hacking_threat_to_websites.pdf |title=The Growing Hacking Threat to Websites: An Ongoing Commitment to Web Application Security |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Chris |last2=Martinez |first2=Richard |publisher=Frost &amp; Sullivan |accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common examples of security exploits are [[SQL injection]], [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] which abuse security holes that may result from substandard programming practice. Other exploits would be able to be used through [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[PHP]], [[Secure Shell|SSH]], [[Telnet]] and some Web pages. These are very common in Web site and Web domain hacking.

===Techniques===
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
;Vulnerability scanner
:A [[vulnerability scanner]] is a tool used to quickly check computers on a network for known weaknesses. Hackers also commonly use [[port scanner]]s. These check to see which ports on a specified computer are "open" or available to access the computer, and sometimes will detect what program or service is listening on that port, and its version number. ([[Firewall (computing)|Firewalls]] defend computers from intruders by limiting access to ports and machines, but they can still be circumvented.)

;Finding vulnerabilities
:Hackers may also attempt to find vulnerabilities manually. A common approach is to search for possible vulnerabilities in the code of the computer system then test them, sometimes [[reverse engineering]] the software if the code is not provided.

;Brute-force attack
:Password guessing. This method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used, because of the time a brute-force search takes.&lt;ref&gt;Kerner, Sean Michael. "Sentry MBA Uses Credential Stuffing To Hack Sites." ''Eweek'' (2016): 8. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Password cracking
:[[Password cracking]] is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. Common approaches include repeatedly trying guesses for the password, trying the most common passwords by hand, and repeatedly trying passwords from a "dictionary", or a text file with many passwords.

;Packet analyzer
:A [[packet analyzer]] ("packet sniffer") is an application that captures data packets, which can be used to capture passwords and other [[data in transit]] over the network.

;Spoofing attack (phishing)
:A [[spoofing attack]] involves one program, system or website that successfully masquerades as another by falsifying data and is thereby treated as a trusted system by a user or another program&amp;nbsp;— usually to fool programs, systems or users into revealing confidential information, such as user names and passwords.

;Rootkit
:A [[rootkit]] is a program that uses low-level, hard-to-detect methods to subvert control of an operating system from its legitimate operators. Rootkits usually obscure their installation and attempt to prevent their removal through a subversion of standard system security. They may include replacements for system binaries, making it virtually impossible for them to be detected by checking [[Process (computing)|process tables]].

;Social engineering
:In the second stage of the targeting process, hackers often use [[Social engineering (security)|Social engineering]] tactics to get enough information to access the network. They may contact the system administrator and pose as a user who cannot get access to his or her system. This technique is portrayed in the 1995 film ''Hackers'', when protagonist Dade "Zero Cool" Murphy calls a somewhat clueless employee in charge of security at a television network. Posing as an accountant working for the same company, Dade tricks the employee into giving him the phone number of a modem so he can gain access to the company's computer system.

:Hackers who use this technique must have cool personalities, and be familiar with their target's security practices, in order to trick the system administrator into giving them information. In some cases, a help-desk employee with limited security experience will answer the phone and be relatively easy to trick. Another approach is for the hacker to pose as an angry supervisor, and when his/her authority is questioned, threaten to fire the help-desk worker. Social engineering is very effective, because users are the most vulnerable part of an organization. No security devices or programs can keep an organization safe if an employee reveals a password to an unauthorized person.

:Social engineering can be broken down into four sub-groups:
:* '''''Intimidation''''' As in the "angry supervisor" technique above, the hacker convinces the person who answers the phone that their job is in danger unless they help them. At this point, many people accept that the hacker is a supervisor and give them the information they seek.
:* '''''Helpfulness'''''  The opposite of intimidation, helpfulness exploits many people's natural instinct to help others solve problems. Rather than acting angry, the hacker acts distressed and concerned. The help desk is the most vulnerable to this type of social engineering, as (a.) its general purpose is to help people; and (b.) it usually has the authority to change or reset passwords, which is exactly what the hacker wants.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Samuel T. C. "Helping The Hacker? Library Information, Security, And Social Engineering." ''Information Technology &amp; Libraries'' 25.4 (2006): 222-225. ''Academic Search Complete''. Web. 7 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''''Name-dropping''''' The hacker uses names of authorized users to convince the person who answers the phone that the hacker is a legitimate user him or herself. Some of these names, such as those of webpage owners or company officers, can easily be obtained online. Hackers have also been known to obtain names by examining discarded documents ([[garbage picking|"dumpster diving"]]).
:* '''''Technical'''''  Using technology is also a way to get information. A hacker can send a fax or email to a legitimate user, seeking a response that contains vital information. The hacker may claim that he or she is involved in law enforcement and needs certain data for an investigation, or for record-keeping purposes.

;Trojan horses
:A [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] is a program that seems to be doing one thing but is actually doing another. It can be used to set up a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]] in a computer system, enabling the intruder to gain access later. (The name refers to the [[Trojan Horse|horse]] from the [[Trojan War]], with the conceptually similar function of deceiving defenders into bringing an intruder into a protected area.)

;Computer virus
:A [[computer virus|virus]] is a self-replicating program that spreads by inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. By doing this, it behaves similarly to a [[Virus|biological virus]], which spreads by inserting itself into living cells. While some viruses are harmless or mere hoaxes, most are considered malicious.

;Computer worm
:Like a virus, a [[computer worm|worm]] is also a self-replicating program. It differs from a virus in that (a.) it propagates through computer networks without user intervention; and (b.) does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Nonetheless, many people use the terms "virus" and "worm" interchangeably to describe any self-propagating program.

;Keystroke logging
:A [[Keystroke logging|keylogger]] is a tool designed to record ("log") every keystroke on an affected machine for later retrieval, usually to allow the user of this tool to gain access to confidential information typed on the affected machine. Some keyloggers use virus-, trojan-, and rootkit-like methods to conceal themselves. However, some of them are used for legitimate purposes, even to enhance computer security. For example, a business may maintain a keylogger on a computer used at a [[point of sale]] to detect evidence of employee fraud.

;Attack patterns
:[[Attack patterns]] are defined as series of repeatable steps that can be applied to simulate an attack against the security of a system. They can be used for testing purposes or locating potential vulnerabilities. They also provide, either physically or in reference, a common solution pattern for preventing a given attack.

'''Tools and Procedures'''
:A thorough examination of hacker tools and procedures may be found in Cengage Learning's E|CSA certification workbook.&lt;ref name="E|CSA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Penetration Testing: Procedures &amp; Methodologies |last=Press |first=EC-Council |year=2011 |publisher=CENGAGE Learning|location=Clifton, NY |isbn=1435483677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its members often advocate freedom of information, strongly opposing the principles of copyright, as well as the rights of free speech and privacy.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Writing software and performing other activities to support these views is referred to as [[hacktivism]]. Some consider illegal cracking ethically justified for these goals; a common form is [[website defacement]].

===Hacker groups and conventions===
{{Main article|Hacker conference|Hacker group}}

The computer underground is supported by regular real-world gatherings called [[hacker convention]]s or "hacker cons". These events include [[SummerCon]] (Summer), [[DEF CON]], [[HoHoCon]] (Christmas), [[ShmooCon]] (February), [[Black Hat Conference|BlackHat]], [[Chaos Communication Congress]], AthCon, Hacker Halted, and HOPE.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Local Hackfest groups organize and compete to develop their skills to send a team to a prominent convention to compete in group pentesting, exploit and forensics on a larger scale. Hacker groups became popular in the early 1980s, providing access to hacking information and resources and a place to learn from other members. Computer [[bulletin board systems]] (BBSs), such as the Utopias, provided platforms for information-sharing via dial-up modem. Hackers could also gain credibility by being affiliated with elite groups.&lt;ref name="thomas"/&gt;

===United States===

{{usc|18|1030}}, more commonly known as the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]], prohibits unauthorized access or damage of "protected computers". "Protected computers" are defined in {{USCSub|18|1030|e|2}} as:

* A computer exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution or the United States Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or the Government.
* A computer which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States;

The maximum imprisonment or fine for violations of the ''Computer Fraud and Abuse Act'' depends on the severity of the violation and the offender's history of violations under the ''Act''.

==Hacking and the media==

===Hacker magazines===
{{Main category|Hacker magazines}}
The most notable hacker-oriented print publications are ''[[Phrack]]'', ''[[Hakin9]]'' and ''[[2600: The Hacker Quarterly]]''.

It includes interviews with The Pirate Bay members [[Fredrik Neij]] (tiamo), [[Gottfrid Svartholm]] (anakata) and [[Peter Sunde]] (brokep) that were later re-used by agreement in the documentary film ''[[Good Copy Bad Copy]]'', as well as with Piratbyrån members [[Rasmus Fleischer]] (rsms), Johan (krignell) and Sara Andersson (fraux).

Thematically, ''Part 2'' "examines the technological and enforcement end of the [[copyright]] wars, and on the way that using the internet makes you a copier, and how copying puts you in legal jeopardy."&lt;ref name=Doctorow&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/12/29/steal-this-film-part.html| title=Steal This Film, Part II: the Internet makes us into copiers |publisher=Boingboing.com |first=Cory |last=Doctorow |date=29 December 2007 |accessdate=20 February 2010}} Early review.&lt;/ref&gt; It discusses [[Mark Getty]]'s assertion that 'intellectual property is the oil of the 21st century'. ''Part 2'' draws parallels between the impact of the [[printing press]] and the internet in terms of making information accessible beyond a privileged group or "controllers". The argument is made that the decentralised nature of the internet makes the enforcement of conventional [[copyright]] impossible. Adding to this the internet turns consumers into producers, by way of [[user generated content]], leading to the sharing, [[mashup (music)|mashup]] and creation of content not motivated by financial gains. This has fundamental implications for market-based media companies. The documentary asks "How will society change" and states "This is the Future – And it has nothing to do with your bank balance".

[[Boing Boing]]'s [[Cory Doctorow]] called it 'an amazing, funny, enraging and inspiring documentary series', and Part II "even better than part I."&lt;ref name=Doctorow /&gt;

==Trial Edition==

A Trial Edition (also known as '2.5' or 'Spectrial' edition) was released to coincide with the trial in 2009 of The Pirate Bay. This version includes material from ''Steal This Film I'' and ''II'' combined with new interviews shot with Peter Sunde and others during 2008, some historical background about the Pirate Bay and Dutch printers (who were also considered pirates) as well as interview clips about the legal conflict itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roettgers|first= Janko|date=18 February 2009| url=http://www.salon.com/technology/the_gigaom_network/online_video/index.html?section=online_video&amp;blog=/tech/giga_om/online_video/2009/02/17/new_steal_this_film_documentary_just_in_time_for_pirate_bay_trial | title=New Steal This Film Documentary Just in Time For Pirate Bay Trial|work=GigaOM|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Steal This Film 'Spectrial Edition''' is widely available online and it is thought to be this version that is now available to television stations and others.

===Online distribution===

The film is famous partly for being one of the most downloaded documentaries to date.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Part One was released through an arrangement with The Pirate Bay; the filesharing site marketed ''Steal This Film'' in place of its own pirate ship logo. This produced millions of downloads for the film{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} and catapulted it to wide recognition on the Internet after it hit Digg, Slashdot, Reddit and other online centres of attention.

''Steal This Film (Part 2)'' was distributed in a similar manner, but with more trackers and indexes involved, including [[Isohunt]] and [[Mininova]]. Estimates of the total current downloads of the film hover at around the 6 million mark via bittorrent &lt;!-- lowercase - the protocol, not the software --&gt;alone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Since the creators have not attempted to restrict copying, the film is also available on YouTube, Google Video and many other web-based video services.

'''Stereotype threat''' is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of conforming to [[stereotype]]s about their social group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Shih | first1 = Margaret J. | last2 = Pittinsky | first2 = Todd L. | last3 = Ho | first3 = Geoffrey C. | contribution = Stereotype boost: positive outcomes from the activation of positive stereotypes |editor-last1 = Inzlicht| editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Schmader | editor-first2 = Toni | title = Stereotype threat: theory, process, and application |pages = 5–6, 141–143 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York, New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780199732449 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_EIrkhfQLsC&amp;pg=5 Preview 1.] [https://books.google.com/books?id=G_EIrkhfQLsC&amp;pg=141 Preview 2.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Claude M.|last2=Aronson|first2=Joshua | author-link1 = Claude Steele |title=Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=5|date=November 1995 |pages=797–811 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}} [http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Good-rec2-Steele_&amp;_Aronson_95.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Since its introduction into the academic literature, stereotype threat has become one of the most widely studied topics in the field of [[social psychology]].&lt;ref name="Schmader2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmader | first1 = Toni | last2 = Johns | first2 = Michael | last3 = Forbes | first3 = Chad | title = An integrated process model of stereotype threat effects on performance | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 115 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=336–356| doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.115.2.336 |pmid=18426293|pmc=2570773}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stereotype threat has been argued to show a reduction in the performance of individuals who belong to negatively stereotyped groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M | last2 = Spencer | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Aronson | first3 = Joshua  | author-link1 = Claude Steele | contribution = Contending with group image: the psychology of stereotype and social identity threat | editor-last = Zanna | editor-first = Mark P. | title = Advances in experimental social psychology, volume 34 | pages = 379–440 | publisher = Academic Press | location = Amsterdam | isbn = 9780120152346 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Claude M. | author-link = Claude Steele |title=A threat in the air: How stereotypes shape intellectual identity and performance|journal=American Psychologist|volume=52|issue=6|year=1997|pages=613–629|issn=0003-066X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.52.6.613|pmid=9174398|citeseerx=10.1.1.318.9608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the theory, if negative stereotypes are present regarding a specific group, group members are likely to become [[Anxiety|anxious]] about their performance, which may hinder their ability to perform to their full potential. Importantly, the individual does not need to subscribe to the stereotype for it to be activated. It is hypothesized that the mechanism through which anxiety (induced by the activation of the stereotype) decreases performance is by depleting [[working memory]] (especially the phonological aspects of the working memory system).&lt;ref name="BeilockEtAl2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beilock|first1=Sian L.|last2=Rydell|first2=Robert J.|last3=McConnell|first3=Allen R.|title=Stereotype threat and working memory: Mechanisms, alleviation, and spillover|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=136|issue=2|year=2007|pages=256–276|doi=10.1037/0096-3445.136.2.256|pmid=17500650|citeseerx=10.1.1.669.9881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, studies have cautioned that stereotype threat should not be interpreted as a factor in real-world performance gaps.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sackett2004b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoet2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"/&gt; One review has voiced concerns that the effect has been over-estimated for schoolgirls and that the field likely suffers from [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name="Flore2014" /&gt;

Stereotype threat is purportedly a contributing factor to long-standing [[Race and intelligence|racial]] and [[Gender gaps in mathematics and reading|gender gaps]] in academic performance. It may occur whenever an individual's performance might confirm a negative stereotype because stereotype threat is thought to arise from a particular situation, rather than from an individual's [[personality trait]]s or characteristics. Since most people have at least one [[social identity]] which is negatively stereotyped, most people are vulnerable to stereotype threat if they encounter a situation in which the stereotype is relevant. Situational factors that increase stereotype threat can include the difficulty of the task, the belief that the task measures their abilities, and the relevance of the stereotype to the task. Individuals show higher degrees of stereotype threat on tasks they wish to perform well on and when they identify strongly with the stereotyped group. These effects are also increased when they expect [[discrimination]] due to their identification with a negatively stereotyped group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Steele | first1 = Claude M. | last2 = Spencer | first2 = Steven J. | last3 = Aronson | first3 = Joshua | doi = 10.1016/S0065-2601(02)80009-0 | title = Contending with group image: the psychology of stereotype and social identity threat | series = Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 34 | pages = 379–440 | date = 2002 | isbn = 9780120152346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated experiences of stereotype threat can lead to a [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] of diminished confidence, poor performance, and loss of interest in the relevant area of achievement.&lt;ref name="GilovichKeltner2006"&gt;{{citation|author-last1=Gilovich|author-first1=Thomas|author-last2=Keltner|author-first2=Dacher |author-last3=Nisbett|author-first3= Richard E. | contribution = Being a member of a stigmatized group: stereotype threat |editor-last1=Gilovich|editor-first1=Thomas|editor-last2=Keltner|editor-first2=Dacher |editor-last3=Nisbett|editor-first3= Richard E. | title = Social psychology | pages = 467–468 | publisher = W.W.

The opposite of stereotype threat is '''stereotype boost''', which is when people perform better than they otherwise would have, because of exposure to [[positive stereotype]]s about their social group. A variant of stereotype boost is '''stereotype lift''', which is people achieving better performance because of exposure to negative stereotypes about other social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Original study==
[[File:Stereotype threat bw.jpg|thumb|right|300px|"The Effects of Stereotype Threat on the Standardized Test Performance of College Students (adjusted for group differences on SAT)". From J. Aronson, C.M. Steele, M.F. Salinas, M.J. Lustina, ''Readings About the Social Animal'', 8th edition, ed. E. Aronson]]
In 1995, [[Claude Steele]] and Joshua Aronson performed the first experiments demonstrating that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance.&lt;ref name=SteeleAronson /&gt; They had African-American and [[European American|European-American]] college students take a difficult verbal portion of the [[Graduate Record Examination]] test. As would be expected based on national averages, the African-American students did not perform as well on the test. Steele and Aronson split students into three groups: stereotype-threat (in which the test was described as being "diagnostic of intellectual ability"), non-stereotype threat (in which the test was described as "a laboratory problem-solving task that was nondiagnostic of ability"), and a third condition (in which the test was again described as nondiagnostic of ability, but participants were asked to view the difficult test as a challenge). All three groups received the same test.

Adjusted for previous SAT scores, subjects in the non-diagnostic-challenge condition performed significantly better than those in the non-diagnostic-only condition and those in the diagnostic condition. In the first experiment, the race-by-condition interaction was marginally significant. However, the second study reported in the same paper found a significant interaction effect of race and condition. This suggested that placement in the diagnostic condition significantly impacted African Americans compared with European Americans.&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

Steele and Aronson concluded that changing the instructions on the test could reduce African-American students' concern about confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Supporting this conclusion, they found that African-American students who regarded the test as a measure of intelligence had more thoughts related to negative stereotypes of their group. Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task. They found that African Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words associated with relevant negative stereotypes (e.g., completing "__mb" as "dumb" rather than as "numb").&lt;ref name="SteeleAronson" /&gt;

==Further empirical studies==
More than 300 published papers show the effects of stereotype threat on performance in a variety of domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://diversity.arizona.edu/sites/diversity/files/stereotype_threat_overview.pdf |title=Stereotype Threat: An Overview |last1=Stroessner |first1=Steve |last2=Good |first2=Catherine |website=diversity.arizona.edu |publisher=Reducing Stereotype Threat.org |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the stereotype threat that occurs depends on how the task is framed. If a task is framed to be neutral, stereotype threat is not likely to occur; however, if tasks are framed in terms of active stereotypes, participants are likely to perform worse on the task. For example, a study on chess players revealed that female players performed more poorly than expected when they were told they would be playing against a male opponent. In contrast, women who were told that their opponent was female performed as would be predicted by past ratings of performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maass|first1=Anne|last2=D'Ettole|first2=Claudio|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|title=Checkmate?

Researchers Vishal Gupta, Daniel Turban, and Nachiket Bhawe extended stereotype threat research to [[entrepreneurship]], a traditionally male-stereotyped profession. Their study revealed that stereotype threat can depress women's entrepreneurial intentions while boosting men's intentions. However, when entrepreneurship is presented as a gender-neutral profession, men and women express a similar level of interest in becoming entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name = "Stereotype Threat and Entrepreneurial Intentions"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=V.

The mere presence of other people can evoke stereotype threat. In one experiment, women who took a mathematics exam along with two other women got 70% of the answers right, whereas women who took the same exam in the presence of two men got an average score of 55%.&lt;ref name="InzlichtBen-Zeev2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inzlicht|first1=M.|last2=Ben-Zeev|first2=T.|title=A Threatening Intellectual Environment: Why Females Are Susceptible to Experiencing Problem-Solving Deficits in the Presence of Males|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=5|year=2000|pages=365–371|issn=0956-7976|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00272|pmid=11228906|citeseerx=10.1.1.24.1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a study conducted by Desert, Preaux, and Jund in 2009 was to see if children from lower [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic groups]] are affected by stereotype threat. The study compared children that were 6–7 years old with children that were 8–9 years old from multiple elementary schools. These children were presented with the [[Raven's Progressive Matrices|Raven's Matrices]] test, which is an intellectual ability test. Separate groups of children were given directions in an evaluative way and other groups were given directions in a non-evaluative way. The "evaluative" group received instructions that are usually given with the Raven Matrices test, while the "non-evaluative" group was given directions which made it seem as if the children were simply playing a game. The results showed that third graders performed better on the test than the first graders did, which was expected. However, the lower socioeconomic status children did worse on the test when they received directions in an evaluative way than the higher socioeconomic status children did when they received directions in an evaluative way. These results suggested that the framing of the directions given to the children may have a greater effect on performance than socioeconomic status. This was shown by the differences in performance based on which type of instructions they received. This information can be useful in classroom settings to help improve the performance of students of lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desert|first=Michael|author2=Marie Preaux |author3=Robin Jund |title=So young and already victims of stereotype threat: Socio-economic status and performance of 6 to 9 years old children on Raven's progressive matrices|journal=European Journal of Psychology of Education|year=2009|volume=24|issue=2|pages=207–218|doi=10.1007/BF03173012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been studies on the effects of stereotype threat based on age. A study was done on 99 senior citizens ranging in age from 60–75 years. These seniors were given multiple tests on certain factors and categories such as memory and physical abilities, and were also asked to evaluate how physically fit they believe themselves to be. Additionally, they were asked to read articles that contained both positive and negative outlooks about seniors, and they watched someone reading the same articles. The goal of this study was to see if priming the participants before the tests would affect performance. The results showed that the control group performed better than those that were primed with either negative or positive words prior to the tests. The control group seemed to feel more confident in their abilities than the other two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Sean|author2=Joseph Baker |author3=William Pearce |author4=Janice Deakin |title=Immunity to Popular Stereotypes of Aging?

Many psychological experiments carried out on Stereotype Threat focus on the physiological effects of negative stereotype threat on performance, looking at both high and low status groups. Scheepers and Ellemers tested the following hypothesis: when assessing a performance situation on the basis of current beliefs the low status group members would show a physiological threat response, and high-status members would also show a physiological threat response when examining a possible alteration of the status quo(Scheepers &amp; Ellemers, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=Ellemers|first2=Naomi|date=March 2005|title=When the pressure is up: The assessment of social identity threat in low and high status groups|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=41 |issue=2|pages=192–200|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.06.002|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this experiment were in line with expectations. As predicted, participants in the low status condition showed higher blood pressure immediately after the status feedback, while participants in the high-status condition showed a spike in blood pressure while anticipating the second round of the task.

In 2012, Scheepers et al. hypothesized that when high social power is stimulated 'an efficient cardiovascular pattern (challenge)' is produced, whereas, 'an inefficient cardiovascular pattern' or threat is caused by the activation of low social power (Scheepers, de Wit, Ellemers &amp; Sassenberg, 2012). Two experiments were carried out in order to test this hypothesis. The first experiment looked at power priming and the second experiment related to role play. Both results from these two experiments provided evidence in support for the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheepers|first=Daan|last2=de Wit|first2=Frank|last3=Ellemers|first3=Naomi|last4=Sassenberg|first4=Kai|date=January 2012|title=Social power makes the heart work more efficiently: Evidence from cardiovascular markers of challenge and threat|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48 |issue=1|pages=371–374|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.06.014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype lift and stereotype boost==
Stereotype threat concerns how stereotype cues can harm performance. However, in certain situations, stereotype activation can also lead to performance enhancement through stereotype lift or stereotype boost. Stereotype lift increases performance when people are exposed to negative stereotypes about another group.&lt;ref name="Walton 2003 456–467"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=G.

C. |editor=Inzlicht, M. |editor2=Schmader, T.|chapter=Stereotype boost: Positive outcomes from the activation of positive stereotypes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotype boost occurs when a positive aspect of an individual's social identity is made salient in an identity-relevant domain. Although stereotype boost is similar to stereotype lift in enhancing performance, stereotype lift is the result of a negative outgroup stereotype, whereas stereotype boost occurs due to activation of a positive [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] stereotype.&lt;ref name="Shih, M. J. 2012 141–156"/&gt;

Consistent with the positive racial stereotype concerning their superior quantitative skills, [[Asian American]] women performed better on a math test when their Asian identity was [[Priming (psychology)|primed]] compared to a [[Treatment and control groups|control condition]] where no social identity was primed. Conversely, these participants did worse on the math test when instead their gender identity—which is associated with stereotypes of inferior quantitative skills—was made salient, which is consistent with stereotype threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shih|first=M|author2=Pittinsky, T.L. |author3=Trahan, A. |title=Domain-specific effects of stereotypes on performance|journal=Self and Identity|year=2006|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/15298860500338534|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/getFile.aspx?Id=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steen|first=L.

==Mechanisms==
Although numerous studies demonstrate the effects of stereotype threat on performance, questions remain as to the specific cognitive factors that underlie these effects. Steele and Aronson originally speculated that attempts to suppress stereotype-related thoughts lead to anxiety and the narrowing of [[attention]]. This could contribute to the observed deficits in performance. In 2008, [[Toni Schmader]], Michael Johns, and Chad Forbes published an integrated model of stereotype threat that focused on three interrelated factors:
# [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] arousal; 
# performance monitoring, which narrows attention; and, 
# efforts to suppress negative thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name="Schmader2008"/&gt;
Schmader et al. suggest that these three factors summarize the pattern of evidence that has been accumulated by past experiments on stereotype threat. For example, stereotype threat has been shown to disrupt working memory and [[executive function]],&lt;ref name="Working Memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmader|first1=Toni|last2=Johns|first2=Michael|title=Converging Evidence That Stereotype Threat Reduces Working Memory Capacity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=85|issue=3|year=2003|pages=440–452|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.3.440|pmid=14498781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ego depletion" /&gt; increase arousal,&lt;ref name=arousal&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ben-Zeev|first=Talia|author2=Fein, Steven|author3=Inzlicht, Michael|title=Stereotype Threat and Arousal|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=41|issue=2|pages=174–181|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Ben-Zeev,%20Fein,%20Inzlicht.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.11.007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003643/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Ben-Zeev,%20Fein,%20Inzlicht.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; increase [[self-consciousness]] about one's performance,&lt;ref name="Causal Mechanisms of Stereotype Threat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beilock|first1=S.

When a large portion of these resources are spent focusing on anxiety and performance pressure, the individual is likely to perform worse on the task at hand.

A number of studies looking at physiological and neurological responses support Schmader and colleagues' integrated model of the processes that produce stereotype threat.

With regard to performance monitoring and vigilance, studies of brain activity have supported the idea that stereotype threat increases both of these processes.

Another study used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to investigate brain activity associated with stereotype threat.

A study conducted by Boucher, Rydell, Loo, and Rydell has shown that stereotype threat not only affects performance, but can also affect the ability to learn new information. In the study, undergraduate men and women had a session of learning followed by an assessment of what they learned. Some participants were given information intended to induce stereotype threat, and some of these participants were later given "gender fair" information, which it was predicted would reduce or remove stereotype threat. As a result, participants were split into four separate conditions: control group, stereotype threat only, stereotype threat removed before learning, and stereotype threat removed after learning. The results of the study showed that the women who were presented with the "gender fair" information performed better on the math related test than the women who were not presented with this information. This study also showed that it was more beneficial to women for the "gender fair" information to be presented prior to learning rather than after learning. These results suggest that eliminating stereotype threat prior to taking mathematical tests can help women perform better, and that eliminating stereotype threat prior to mathematical learning can help women learn better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boucher|first=Kathryn L.|author2=Robert Rydell |author3=Katie Van Loo |author4=Michael Rydell |title=Reducing Stereotype threat in order to facilitate learning|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2012|volume=42|issue=2|pages=174–179|doi=10.1002/ejsp.871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long run, the chronic experience of stereotype threat may lead individuals to disidentify with the stereotyped group. For example, a woman may stop seeing herself as "a math person" after experiencing a series of situations in which she experienced stereotype threat. This disidentification is thought to be a psychological coping strategy to maintain [[self-esteem]] in the face of failure.&lt;ref name="Learning in a Man's World"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Jennifer|last2=James|first2=Jacquelyn B.|last3=Barnett|first3=Rosalind Chait|title=Learning in a Man's World: Examining the Perceptions of Undergraduate Women in Male-Dominated Academic Areas|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume=26|issue=1|year=2002|pages=46–50|issn=0361-6843|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated exposure to anxiety and nervousness can lead individuals to choose to distance themselves from the stereotyped group.

Although much of the research on stereotype threat has examined the effects of coping with negative stereotype on academic performance, recently there has been an emphasis on how coping with stereotype threat could "spillover" to dampen self-control and thereby affect a much broader category of behaviors, even in non-stereotyped domains.&lt;ref name="stereotype threat spillover"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=Kang, Sonia|title=Stereotype threat spillover: How coping with threats to social identity affects, aggression, eating, decision-making, and attention|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=99|issue=3|pages=467–481|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20&amp;%20Kang,%202010.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0018951|pmid=20649368|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003450/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/publications/Inzlicht%20%26%20Kang%2C%202010.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.600.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Michael Inzlicht]] and colleagues suggest that, when women cope with negative stereotypes about their math ability, they perform worse on math tests, and that, after completing the math test, women may continue to show deficits even in unrelated domains. For example, women might overeat, be more aggressive, make more risky decisions,&lt;ref name="stereotype threat spillover" /&gt; and show less endurance during physical exercise.&lt;ref name="ego depletion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inzlicht|first=Michael|author2=McKay, Linda|author3=Aronson, Joshua|title=Stigma as ego-depletion: How being the target of prejudice affects self-control|journal=Psychological Science|year=2006|volume=17|issue=3|pages=262–269|url=http://michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Inzlicht,%20McKay,%20&amp;%20Aronson.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01695.x|pmid=16507068|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003531/http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/research/research_articles/Inzlicht%2C%20McKay%2C%20%26%20Aronson.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perceived discrimination associated with stereotype threat can also have negative long-term consequences on individuals' [[mental health]].

==Mitigation==
Additional research seeks ways to boost the test scores and academic achievement of students in negatively stereotyped groups. There are many ways to combat the effects of stereotype threat.

# In one study, teaching college women about stereotype threat and its effects on performance was sufficient to eliminate the predicted gender gap on a difficult math test.&lt;ref name="pmid15733195"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johns M, Schmader T, Martens A |title=Knowing is half the battle: teaching stereotype threat as a means of improving women's math performance |journal=Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=175–9 |date=March 2005 |pmid=15733195 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00799.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making people aware of the fact that they will not necessarily perform worse despite the existence of a stereotype can boost their performance. However, other research has found the opposite effect. In one study, women were given a text "summarizing an experiment in which stereotypes, and not biological differences, were shown to be the cause of women's underperformance in math", and then they performed a math exercise. It was found that "women who properly understood the meaning of the information provided, and thus became knowledgeable about stereotype threat, performed significantly worse at a calculus task".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tomasetto C, Appoloni A |title=A lesson not to be learned?

# Have participants engage in [[self-affirmation]], which is a process in which participants write about a value that is important to them. In 2006, researchers Geoffrey L. Cohen, Julio Garcia, Nancy Apfel, and Allison Master found that a self-affirmation exercise (in the form of a brief in-class writing assignment) significantly improved the grades of African-American middle-school students, and reduced the racial achievement gap by 40%. Cohen et al. have suggested that the racial achievement gap could be at least partially ameliorated by brief and targeted social-psychological interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cohen GL, Garcia J, Apfel N, Master A |title=Reducing the racial achievement gap: a social-psychological intervention |journal=Science |volume=313 |issue=5791 |pages=1307–10 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16946074 |doi=10.1126/science.1128317}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such intervention was attempted with UK medical students, who were given a written assignment and a clinical assessment. For the written assignment group, white students performed worse than minority students. For the clinical assessment, both groups improved their performance maintaining the racial difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Woolf K, McManus IC, Gill D, Dace J |title=The effect of a brief social intervention on the examination results of UK medical students: a cluster randomised controlled trial |journal=BMC Medical Education |volume=9|page=35 |date=June 2009 |pmid= 19552810|doi=10.1186/1472-6920-9-35 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6920/9/35/ |pmc=2717066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Allowing participants to think about a positive value or attribute about themselves prior to completing the task seemed to make them less susceptible to stereotype threat.
# Increase participants' feelings of social belonging within the academic world. Greg Walton and Geoffrey Cohen were able to boost the grades of African-American college students, as well as eliminate the racial achievement gap over the first year of college, by telling participants that concerns about social belonging tend to lessen over time.&lt;ref name="Social belonging"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Walton, G.

If minority college students are welcomed into the world of academia, they are less likely to be influenced by the negative stereotypes of poor minority performance on academic tasks.
# Construct environments and have the physical objects in the environment not reflect one majority group. Researchers argued that individuals make decisions about group membership based on the group’s environment and proved that altering the physical objects in a room boosted minority participation.

# Increase the representation of minority groups in that field can also mitigate stereotype threat. In one study, women in the STEM related field were shown a video of a conference with either a balanced or unbalanced ratio of men to women.

==Criticism==
The stereotype threat explanation of [[achievement gap]]s has attracted criticism. According to Paul R. Sackett, Chaitra M. Hardison, and Michael J. Cullen, both the media and scholarly literature have wrongly concluded that eliminating stereotype threat could completely eliminate differences in test performance between European Americans and African Americans.&lt;ref name="Sackett2004a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On interpreting stereotype threat as accounting for African American-White differences on cognitive tests|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|pages=7–13|date=January 2004|pmid=14736315|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.7|url=http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1935-990X|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404150510/http://www2.uni-jena.de/svw/igc/studies/ss03/sackitt_hardison_cullen_2004.pdf|archivedate=2013-04-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sackett et al. have pointed out that, in Steele and Aronson's (1995) experiments where stereotype threat was removed, an achievement gap of approximately one [[standard deviation]] remained between the groups, which is very close in size to that routinely reported between African American and European Americans' average scores on large-scale standardized tests such as the SAT. In subsequent correspondence between Sackett et al. and Steele and Aronson, Sackett et al. wrote that "They [Steele and Aronson] agree that it is a misinterpretation of the Steele and Aronson (1995) results to conclude that eliminating stereotype threat eliminates the African American-White test-score gap."&lt;ref name="Sackett2004b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sackett|first1=Paul R.|last2=Hardison|first2=Chaitra M.|last3=Cullen|first3=Michael J.|title=On the Value of Correcting Mischaracterizations of Stereotype Threat Research|journal=American Psychologist|volume=59|issue=1|year=2004|pages=48–49|issn=1935-990X|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.59.1.48|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050208/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2004-sackett.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur R. Jensen]] criticised stereotype threat theory on the basis that it invokes an additional mechanism to explain effects which could be, according to him, explained by other, well-known, and well-established theories, such as test anxiety and especially the [[Yerkes–Dodson law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yerkes | first1 = Robert M. | author-link1 = Robert M.

[[File:FloreAndWicherts2015 meta analysis sex stereotype threat.png|thumb|Meta-analysis of stereotype threat on girls showing asymmetry typical of publication bias. From Flore, P. C., &amp; Wicherts, J. M. (2014)&lt;ref name="Flore2014"/&gt;]]

The strength and type of the effect has also been questioned. Flore and Wicherts concluded the reported effect is small, but also that the field is inflated by [[publication bias]]. They argue that, correcting for this, the most likely true effect size is near zero (see meta-analytic plot, highlighting both the restriction of large effect to [[Statistical power|low-powered]] studies, and the plot asymmetry which occurs when publication bias is active).&lt;ref name="Flore2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flore|first1=Paulette C.|last2=Wicherts|first2=Jelte M.|title=Does stereotype threat influence performance of girls in stereotyped domains? A meta-analysis|journal=Journal of School Psychology|volume=53|issue=1|year=2014|pages=25–44|issn=0022-4405|doi=10.1016/j.jsp.2014.10.002|pmid=25636259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier meta-analyses reached similar conclusions. For instance, Ganley et al. (2013)&lt;ref name="Ganley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ganley|first=Colleen M.|author2=Mingle, Leigh A.|author3=Ryan, Allison M.|author4=Ryan, Katherine|author5=Vasilyeva, Marina|author6=Perry, Michelle|title=An Examination of Stereotype Threat Effects on Girls' Mathematics Performance|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1 January 2013|doi=10.1037/a0031412|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf|volume=49|issue=10|pages=1886–1897|pmid=23356523|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719005546/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/85192141/2013-ganley.pdf|archivedate=19 July 2014|df=|citeseerx=10.1.1.353.4436}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined math stereotype threat in a well-powered (total N ~ 1000) multi-experiment study. This allowed examination of potential moderators such as age and implicit vs explicit methods. Significant gender differences in math were found, but "no evidence that the mathematics performance of school-age girls was impacted by stereotype threat" was found. Further, they found that evidence for stereotype threat in children reflects [[publication bias]]: large, well-controlled studies find smaller or non-significant effects, while among the many [[Statistical power|underpowered]] studies run, researchers selectively published those in which [[false-positive]] effects reached significance:&lt;ref name=Ganley2013/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;nonsignificant findings were almost always reported in an article along with some significant stereotype threat effects found either at another age (Ambady et al., 2001; Muzzatti &amp; Agnoli, 2007), only with certain students (Keller, 2007), on certain items (Keller, 2007; Neuville &amp; Croizet, 2007), or in certain contexts (Huguet &amp; Regner, 2007, Study 2; Picho &amp; Stephens, 2012; Tomasetto et al., 2011). Importantly, none of the three unpublished dissertations showed a stereotype threat effect. This observation suggests the possibility that publication bias is occurring. Publication bias refers to the fact that studies with null results are often not written up for publication or accepted for publication (Begg, 1994). This bias is a serious concern, especially if these results are being used to make recommendations for interventions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Tetrasodium pyrophosphate''', also called '''sodium pyrophosphate''', '''tetrasodium phosphate''' or '''TSPP''', is a [[color]]less [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[crystalline]] [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]]  Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a salt composed of [[pyrophosphate]]  and [[sodium]] [[ion]]s.  Toxicity is approximately twice that of [[table salt]] when ingested orally.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mk-IdNTTJB0C&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=tetrasodium+phosphate+toxicity&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UTcG2wT0y9&amp;sig=_c9T9HRdwiV7pMk01T8ZLTzFkl8#PPA260,M1 Handbook of food toxicology]'', S. S. Deshpande, page 260&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a hydrated form, Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;{{middot}}10(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name = "Perry"&gt; D.L. Perry S.L. Phillips (1995) ''Handbook of inorganic compounds''   CRC Press {{ISBN|0-8493-8671-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is used as a [[buffering agent]], an [[emulsifier]], a dispersing agent, and a [[thickening agent]], and is often used as a [[food additive]]. Common [[food]]s containing tetrasodium pyrophosphate include [[chicken nugget]]s, [[marshmallows]], [[pudding]], [[crab]] meat, [[imitation crab]], canned [[tuna]], and [[soy]]-based [[meat]] alternatives and [[cat food]]s and cat treats where it is used as a [[palatability]] enhancer. 

In [[toothpaste]] and dental floss, tetrasodium pyrophosphate acts as a [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] control agent, serving to remove [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] from [[saliva]] and thus preventing them from being deposited on [[teeth]].  Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is used in commercial dental rinses before brushing to aid in [[Dental plaque|plaque]] reduction.

Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is sometimes used in household [[detergent]]s to prevent similar deposition on [[clothing]], but due to its [[phosphate]] content it causes [[eutrophication]] of [[water]], promoting [[algae]] growth.

==Production==
Tetrasodium pyrophosphate is produced by the reaction of furnace-grade [[phosphoric acid]] with [[sodium carbonate]] to form [[disodium phosphate]], which is then heated to 450 °C to form tetrasodium pyrophosphate.

Alternatively, it can be created by the molecular dehydration of dibasic [[sodium phosphate]] at {{convert|500|C}}.

'''United Nations Security Council resolution 1209''', adopted unanimously on 19 November 1998, after recalling resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1170|1170]] (1998) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1196|1196]] (1998) on Africa, the Council addressed illicit arms flows on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Security Council, acting on Secretary-General's Africa report, adopts texts of status and treatment of refugees, illicit arms flow|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1998/19981119.sc6598.html|date=19 November 1998|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
The Security Council considered further a report by the Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] on the situation in Africa concerning the importance of stemming illegal arms flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Annan|first=Kofi|title=Report of the Secretary-General on the situation in Africa|url=https://undocs.org/S/1998/318|publisher=United Nations|date=13 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognised that illegal arms traffic was closely connected to the role of commercial and political interests. African countries did had the right to obtain weapons for reasons of [[national security]] and policing. [[Switzerland]] had offered to hold a conference in [[Geneva]] on illegal arms traffic and there were negotiations in [[Vienna]] on the elaboration of an international convention against transnational organised crime, including a protocol to combat illicit manufacturing and trafficking in [[firearm]]s. The Council commended African initiatives to address the problem of arms flows, uch as in [[Mali]] and [[Mozambique]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).

==Acts==
The Security Council was concerned about large-scale illegal arms trafficking in Africa, particularly of [[small arms]] and the threat it posed to security, development and humanitarian situation on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metz|first=Stephen|title=A Strategic Approach to African Security: Challenges and Prospects|journal=African Security Review|year=2000|volume=9|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, African countries were urged to introduce legislation on the use of arms. Member States, particularly those that manufactured [[weapon]]s, were reminded of the importance of restricting arms transfers which could provoke or prolong armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=CQ Press|title=Historic Documents of 1998|year=1999|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=978-1-56802-442-4|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution encouraged African states to participate in the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms and to establish regional and subregional registers to enhance the transparency of arms transfers. They were also instructed to look to the [[European Union]] and [[Organization of American States]] for their efforts in tackling the arms trade and to adopt similar measures.

In addition, the Secretary-General was encouraged to find ways to identify international arms dealers acting in contravention of national legislation or [[arms embargo]]es imposed by the United Nations. He was also urged to promote co-operation among Member States, to explore ways of disseminating information on arms flows and their destabilising effects and to implement voluntary weapons collection programmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brzoska|first=Michael|title=Smart sanctions: the next steps: the debate on arms embargoes and travel sanctions within the 'Bonn-Berlin process'|year=2001|publisher=Nomos|isbn=978-3-7890-7546-9|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Royal and noble ranks}}
A '''viceroy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|aɪ|s|r|ɔɪ}}) is an official who runs a [[country]], [[colony]], [[city]], [[province]], or sub-national state, in the name of and as the representative of the monarch of the territory. The term derives from the Latin prefix ''vice-'', meaning "in the place of" and the French word ''roy'', meaning "king".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=viceroy|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/viceroy |work=www.dictionary.com |accessdate=17 November 2018 |quote=Origin of viceroy 1515–25; &lt; Middle French, equivalent to vice- vice- + roy king &lt; Latin rēgem, accusative of rēx}}&lt;/ref&gt; A viceroy's territory may be called a [[viceroyalty]], though this term is not always applied. The [[adjective]] form is '''viceregal''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=viceregal|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/viceregal |work=OxfordDictionariesOnline.com |accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; less often '''viceroyal'''.&lt;ref&gt;"Viceroyal, a", ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed. 1989, OED Online, Oxford University Press, 4 April 2000 &lt;http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50277245&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''vicereine''' is sometimes used to indicate a female viceroy ''[[suo jure]]'', although viceroy can serve as a gender-neutral term.&lt;ref name="vicereine"&gt;{{cite web|title=vicereine|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/vicereine|work=OxfordDictionariesOnline.com|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vicereine is more commonly used to indicate a viceroy's wife.&lt;ref name="vicereine"/&gt;

''Viceroy'' is a form of royal appointment rather than noble rank.  An individual viceroy often also held a noble title, however, such as [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]] who was also [[Viceroy of India]].

==Spanish Empire==
The title was originally used by the [[Crown of Aragon]]; where beginning in the 14th century, it referred to the Spanish governors of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]]. After the unification, at the end of the 15th century, later [[King of Spain|kings of Spain]] came to appoint numerous viceroys to rule over various parts of the increasingly vast [[Spanish Empire]] in Europe, the Americas, and overseas elsewhere.

===In Spanish ruled Europe===
In Europe, until the 18th century, the Habsburg crown appointed viceroys of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Navarre]], [[Portugal]], [[Sardinia]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]. With the ascension of the [[House of Bourbon]] to the Spanish throne, the historic Aragonese viceroyalties were replaced by new [[Captaincy|captaincies general]]. At the end of [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the Spanish monarchy was shorn of its Italian possessions.  These Italian territories, however, continued to have viceroys under their new rulers for some time; Sardinia would have a viceroy until 1848.

*[[List of Spanish Viceroys of Sicily]]
*[[List of Spanish Viceroys of Naples]]

===In the Americas===
The Americas were incorporated into the [[Crown of Castile]]. With the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], the institution of viceroys was adapted to govern the highly populated and wealthy regions of the north overseas: [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (Mexico and Philippines) and the south overseas: [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] and South America. The viceroys of these two areas had oversight over the other provinces, with most of the North American, Central American, [[Spanish West Indies|Caribbean]] and [[Spanish East Indies|East Indian]] areas supervised by the viceroy in [[Mexico City]] and the South American ones by the viceroy in [[Lima]], (with the exception of most of today's [[Venezuela]], which was overseen by the high court, or [[Audiencia of Santo Domingo]] on the island of Hispaniola for most of the colonial period). These large administrative territories became known as ''Viceroyalties'' (Spanish term: ''Virreinatos''). There were only two [[New World]] viceroyalties until the 18th century, when the new [[Bourbon Reforms|Bourbon Dynasty]] established two additional viceroyalties to promote economic growth and new settlements on South America. New viceroyalties were created for [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] in 1717 (capital, [[Bogotá]]) and [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|the Río de la Plata]] in 1776 (capital, [[Buenos Aires]]).

[[File:Joaquín de la Pezuela y Sánchez de Aragón.jpg|thumb|[[Joaquín de la Pezuela, 1st Marquis of Viluma|Joaquín de la Pezuela]], antepenultimate [[Viceroyalty of Peru|viceroy of Peru]]]]

The viceroyalties of the Spanish Americas and the Spanish East Indies were subdivided into smaller, autonomous units, the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencias]] ([[tribunal]] with the authority to judge), and the [[Captaincy|Captaincies General]] (military districts),  which in most cases became the bases for the independent countries of modern [[Hispanic America]]. These units gathered the local provinces which could be governed by either a crown official, a [[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]] (sometimes ''alcalde mayor'') or by a [[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]] or town council. Audiencias primarily functioned as superior judicial tribunals, but unlike their European counterparts, the New World audiencias were granted by law both administrative and legislative powers. Captaincies General were primarily military districts set up in areas with a risk of foreign or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] attack, but the captains general were usually given political powers over the provinces under their command. Because the long distances to the viceregal capital would hamper effective communication, both audiencias and captains general were authorized to communicate directly with the crown through the [[Council of the Indies]]. The Bourbon Reforms introduced the new office of the [[intendant]], which was appointed directly by the crown and had broad fiscal and administrative powers in political and military issues.

===India===
The title of Viceroy being awarded to members of the nobility, Viceroys, [[Governor-general|Governors]] and Governing Commissions were many times interleaved until the last Viceroy [[Afonso, Prince Royal of Portugal]], in 1896.
From 1505 to 1896 [[Portuguese India]]&amp;nbsp;– the name "India" and the official name "Estado da India" (''State of India'') including all Portuguese possessions in the Indian Ocean, from southern Africa to Southeast Asia and Australasia, until 1752- was governed either by a Viceroy (Portuguese ''Vice-Rei'') or Governor from its headquarters, in [[Goa]] since 1510. The government started six years after the discovery of sea route to India by [[Vasco da Gama]], in 1505, under first Viceroy [[Francisco de Almeida]] (b.1450–d.1510). Initially, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] tried a power distribution with three governors in different areas of jurisdiction: a government covering the area and possessions in East Africa, [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Persian Gulf]], overseeing up [[Cambay]] (Gujarat); a second one ruling the possessions in [[India]] (Hindustan) and [[Ceylon]], and a third one from [[Malacca]] to the Far East.&lt;ref&gt;''O Secretário dos despachos e coisas da Índia pero d´Alcáçova Carneiro'', p.65, Maria Cecília Costa Veiga de Albuquerque Ramos, Universidade de Lisboa, 2009 (In Portuguese) &lt;http://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/3387/1/ulfl080844_tm.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However the post was centered by governor [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (1509–1515), who became plenipotentiary, and remained so. The duration in office was usually three years, possibly longer, given the power represented: of the thirty-four governors of India in the 16th century, only six had longer mandates.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D.

During some periods of the [[Iberian Union]], between 1580 and 1640, the [[King of Spain]], who was also [[King of Portugal]], appointed [[List of viceroys of Portugal|Viceroys to govern Portugal itself]], as the king had multiple realms throughout Europe and delegated his powers to various viceroys.

==British Empire==

===British India===

Following adoption of the [[Government of India Act 1858]], which transferred control of India from the [[British East India Company]] to the [[The Crown|British Crown]], the Governor-General as representing the Crown became known as the Viceroy. The designation "Viceroy," although it was most frequently used in ordinary parlance, had no statutory authority, and was never employed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]]. Although the Proclamation of 1858 announcing the assumption of the government of India by the Crown referred to [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]] as "first Viceroy and Governor-General," none of the Warrants appointing his successors referred to them as "viceroys," and the title, which was frequently used in warrants dealing with precedence and in public notifications, was basically one of ceremony used in connection with the state and social functions of the sovereign's representative. The Governor-General continued to be the sole representative of the Crown, and the Government of India continued to be vested in the Governor-General-in-Council.&lt;ref&gt;''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, New Edition 1909, vol 4, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The viceroys reported directly to the [[Secretary of State for India]] in London and were advised by the [[Council of India]].  They were largely unencumbered in the exercise of their authority and were among the most powerful men on earth in the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] eras, ruling over an entire [[subcontinent]] with a large military force at their disposal in the form of the [[Indian Army (1895–1947)|British Indian Army]]. Under the terms of the [[Government of India Act 1919]], viceroys shared some limited aspects of their authority with the [[Central Legislative Assembly]], one of the first steps in the establishment of Indian [[home rule]]. This process was accelerated by the [[Government of India Act 1935]] and ultimately led to the independence of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] as [[dominion]]s in 1947. Both countries finally severed complete ties with Britain when they became [[republic]]s &amp;ndash; India as a [[secularism|secular]] republic in 1950 and Pakistan as an [[Islamic republic]] in 1956.

Alongside the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], the viceroy was the public face of the British presence in India, attending to many ceremonial functions as well as political affairs.  As the representative of the [[Emperor of India|Emperors and Empresses of India]], who were also the kings and queens of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the viceroy served as the grand master of the two principal [[chivalric orders]] of British India: the [[Order of the Star of India]] and the [[Order of the Indian Empire]].
[[File:Mountbatten.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], last viceroy of India]]
During the office's history, the Governors-General of India were based in two cities: [[Calcutta]] during the 19th century and New Delhi during the 20th century.  Additionally, whilst Calcutta was the capital of British India, the viceroys spent the summer months at [[Simla, India|Simla]].  The two historic residences of the viceroys still stand: the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan|Viceroy's House]] in New Delhi and [[Raj Bhavan (West Bengal)|Government House]] in Calcutta.  They are used today as the official residences of the [[President of India]] and the [[Governor of West Bengal]], respectively.  The portraits of the Governors-General still hang in a room on the ground floor of the Presidential Palace, one of the last vestiges of both the viceroys and the British Raj.&lt;ref&gt;Nath, Aman, "Dome Over India", India Book House Ltd. {{ISBN|81-7508-352-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Governors-General of India include [[Warren Hastings]], [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|The Earl of Minto]], [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], and [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]].  Lord Mountbatten served as the last Viceroy of British India, but continued on as the first Governor-General of the [[Union of India|dominion of India]].

===Ireland===
The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lords Lieutenant of Ireland]] were often referred to as "Viceroy" after 1700 until 1922, even though the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] had been merged in 1801 into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].

==Commonwealth realms==
The term has occasionally been applied to the [[Governor-General|governors-general]] of the [[Commonwealth Realms]], for example [[Gough Whitlam]] in 1973 told the [[Australian House of Representatives]]: 'The Governor-General is the viceroy of the Queen of Australia'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bQTtYL3KKgcC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=gough+whitlam+viceroy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MsGrsHxAs_&amp;sig=4XYmpX0q8VOibvdD6n9v6PTaSww&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiXhZOxkqvOAhUJnZQKHZpyAxYQ6AEIMDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=gough%20whitlam%20viceroy&amp;f=false Gough Whitlam, The Truth of the Matter, (1979)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Governor General of Canada|governor general of Canada]], the [[Lieutenant Governor (Canada)|lieutenant governors]] of the Canadian provinces and the [[List of Governors-General of Australia|governors-general of Australia]] and [[Governors of the Australian states|governors]] of the Australian states are viceroys in terms of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]]. The [[Australia Act 1986]] also provide that all royal powers in Australia, except the actual appointment of the governor-general and the governors are exercisable by the viceregal representatives. The noun 'viceroy' is rarely used but the adjective 'viceregal' is standard usage.

==Russian Empire==

'''Namestnik''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|наме́стник}}, {{IPA-ru|nɐˈmʲesʲnʲɪk}}) was an office position in the history of the [[Russian Empire]]. It can be translated as "viceroy", "deputy", "lieutenant" (the broader sense of that word) or literally ''in place [[appointee (disambiguation)|appointee]]''. The term has two periods of usage, with different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Efron}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M.E. Sharpe"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Kli͡uchevskiĭ | first1 = V. O.

*In the 12th–16th centuries, ''namestniks'' (more correctly ''[[knyaz]] namestniks'', or "knyaz deputies") were in charge of local administration. In particular, they ruled [[uyezd]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} Тархов, Сергей, "Изменение административно-территориального деления России в XIII-XX в."

*In the 18th–20th centuries, a namestnik was a person in charge of '''namestnichestvo''', with  [[plenipotentiary]] powers. The latter has traditionally been translated as [[viceroyalty]] and "namestnik" as viceroy or [[vicegerent]] (or, as a common blunder, "viceregent"). For example, [[Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov|Mikhail Vorontsov]] was namestnik of [[Bessarabia]] (1823–44) and of the [[Caucasus]] (1844–1854).  Sometimes the term is confused with [[Governor General]] (генерал-губернатор). For example, during Vorontsov's term of office in Bessarabia, seven governor-generals were in, and at the same time he held the office of Governor General of [[New Russia]]. The following namestnik existed under the Romanov Emperors of Russia:&lt;ref name="M.E.

The [[Tsar]] [[Paul of Russia|Paul I]]'s 1799 formation of the [[Russian-American Company]] obviated viceroys in the colonization of the northwestern New World.

===Italian colonies===

In Italian ''Viceré'': The highest colonial representatives in the "federation" of [[Italian East Africa]] (six provinces, each under a governor; together [[Ethiopia]], Eritrea and [[Italian Somaliland]]) were no longer styled "High Commissioner", but "Viceroy and Governor-general" from 5 May 1936, when Italian forces occupied [[Ethiopia]], until 27 November 1941, when the last Italian administrator surrendered to the Allies. The Italian King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel]] claimed the title of "[[Emperor of Ethiopia]]" (Nəgusä nägäst, "King of Kings") and declared himself to be a successor to the [[Nəgusä nägäst]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} even though [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Emperor Haile Selassie I]] continued to hold this title while in exile, and resumed his actual, physical throne on 5 May 1941.

On 7 April 1939, Italy invaded the [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|Kingdom of Albania]] (today [[Albania]]). As '''Viceré of Albania''' of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy were the Marchese [[Francesco Jacomoni]] di San Savino and after his departure General [[Alberto Pariani]].

[[Ban Borić]] was the first ruler and Viceroy of Bosnia, appointed by [[Géza II of Hungary]] by 1154. His war affairs are documented as he fought several notable battles.&lt;ref&gt;The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century&lt;/ref&gt; He also maintained ties with knights [[Templar]] and donated lands in [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Slavonia]] to their Order.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Mary Upton-Ward, H.J.A.

===Ban of Croatia===
{{further|Ban of Croatia}}
From the earliest medieval period in the [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the position of viceroy was held by [[Ban of Croatia]] who acted as king's representative in Croatian lands and supreme commander of Croatian army. In the 18th century, Croatian bans eventually become chief government officials in Croatia. They were at the head of Ban's Government, effectively the first prime ministers of Croatia. The last ban held his position until 1941 and the collapse of Yugoslavia in World War II.

==Ancient antecedents==
An equivalent office, called the [[Exarch]], was created in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire]] towards the end of the sixth century for governors of important areas too far from the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]] to receive regular instruction or reinforcement.  The chosen governors of these provinces were empowered to act in place of the monarch (hence ex-arch) with more discretion and autonomy than was granted other categories of governor.  This was an extraordinary break from the centralized traditions of the [[Roman Empire]] and was an early example of the principle of Viceroyalty.

==Non-Western counterparts==
As with many princely and administrative titles, viceroy is often used, generally unofficially, to render somewhat equivalent titles and offices in non-western cultures.

===Africa===
In cultures all over the continent of Africa, the role of viceroy has been subsumed into a hereditary noble as opposed to strictly administrative position. In the Arabo-Berber north, for example, the title of [[Khalifa]] is often used by individuals who derive their authority to rule from someone else in much the same way as a viceroy would. Elsewhere, subordinate [[inkosi]]s under the rule of a [[paramount chief]] like the [[King of the Zulu Nation]] of [[Southern Africa]] or subordinate [[Oba (ruler)#Oba|baales]] in the realms of the reigning [[Oba (ruler)|oba]]s of [[West Africa]]n [[Yorubaland]]  continue to occupy statutorily recognized positions in the contemporary countries of [[South Africa]] and [[Nigeria]] as the customary representatives of their respective principals in the various areas that are under their immediate control.

=== Maratha Empire, India  ===
Marathas from the time of [[Shivaji ]] sent various empire insiders to run foreign parts such as Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madya Pradesh and Andra Paradesh, where the Maratha empire extended.

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Khedive]] of Egypt, especially during the reign of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] (1805–1848). This officer established an almost autonomous regime in Egypt, which officially still was under Ottoman rule. Although Mehemet Ali/Muhammad Ali used different symbols to mark his independence from the [[Sublime Porte]], he never openly declared himself independent. Adopting the title of viceroy was yet another way to walk the thin line between challenging the Sultan's power explicitly and respecting his jurisdiction. Muhammad Ali Pasha's grandson, [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail Pasha]], subsequently received the title of [[Khedive]] which was almost an equivalent to viceroy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/296116/Ismail-Pasha/296116rellinks/Related-Links Encyclopædia Britannica: Ismail Pasha, Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt and New Spain]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnamese Empire===
The post of Tổng Trấn (''governor of all military provinces'') was a political post in the early period of the [[Vietnam]]ese [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] (1802–1830). From 1802, under the reign of emperor [[Gia Long]], there were two ''Tổng Trấn'' who administered Vietnam's northern part named [[Northern Vietnam|Bắc thành]] with administrative center in [[Hanoi]] and the southern part [[Southern Vietnam|Gia Định thành]] with administrative center in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Gia Định]], while Nguyen emperors ruled only the central region [[Central Vietnam|Kinh Kỳ]] from capital [[Huế|Phú Xuân]]. ''Tổng Trấn'' is sometimes translated to English as viceroy.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Taylor (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=qzb3gdbSBksC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Viceroy+of+Gia+Dinh&amp;lr=&amp;ei=0xn6SpPWDIKKkATGua3uDw#v=onepage&amp;q=Viceroy%20of%20Gia%20Dinh&amp;f=false Goddess on the rise: pilgrimage and popular religion in Vietnam], University of Hawaii Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, emperor [[Minh Mạng]] abolished the post in order to increase the imperial direct ruling power in all over Vietnam.

===Chinese Empires===
{{main|Viceroy (China)}}
During the [[Han Dynasty|Han]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, there existed positions of viceroys having control over various provinces (e.g., [[Liangguang]] = [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]], [[Huguang]] = [[Hubei]] and [[Hunan]]).

=== Siam ===

The '''Western Somali Liberation Front''' ({{lang-so|Jabhadda Xoreynta Somali Galbeed}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''WSLF''') was a separatist rebel group fighting in eastern [[Ethiopia]] to create an independent state. It played a major role in the [[Ogaden War]] of 1977-78 assisting the invading [[Somali Army]].

==History==
[[Somalia|Somali]] guerrilla activity in the [[Ogaden]] and in the [[Haud]] area east of [[Harar]] flared sporadically after [[Somalia]] gained its independence in 1960, but the guerrilla activity remained essentially a police concern until a border war erupted in 1964. When he seized power in [[Mogadishu]] in 1969, [[Siad Barre]] thwarted attempts at an understanding between Ethiopia and Somalia. He pledged to renew efforts to establish a "[[Greater Somalia]]" that would encompass about one-third of Ethiopia's territory. Encouraged by the breakdown of authority in [[Addis Ababa]] after the 1974 overthrow of [[Haile Selassie]], Somalia provided equipment, as well as moral and organizational support to insurgent movements in the Ogaden and southern Ethiopia.

The WSLF was founded by a young captain called Yusuf Dheere Mohamed Sugaal  (Yuusuf the tall man) who was educated and trained in Syria, after finishing high school in [[Hargeisa]]. Upon his return from Syria, Yusuf Dheere has created the ''Ururka Dhalinyara Soomaali Galbeed'' or the Western Somali Youth Organization. Yusuf Dheere, who was well connected and from a noble family, met the Somali president [[Siad Barre]] in 1973 after putting the Somali elders behind his plan, and convinced the Somali President to do something about the Ogaden region. So Siad Barre gave Yusuf Dheere 2 years to give diplomacy a chance and to prepare the [[Somali National Army]], for it was still unproven. In the meanwhile, Yusuf Dheere was told to recruit about 1500 volunteers and was permitted rations for only 1500 people; in the space of a month, he recruited over 3000 soldiers, most of them were old fighters from all over the country.

Two years after the initial meeting, and after going through the UN and unsuccessful peace meeting with Emperor Haile Selassie, Yusuf Dheere was given the go ahead he wanted and was told to get control of at least 60% of the Ogaden region before the Somali army would involve itself in the fighting. The WSLF found its opportunity when the [[Derg]] overthrew Haile Selassie in 1974, and switched from American support to the Soviet Union. Two years later, when the WSLF had control of most of the Ogaden, the first time since the Second World War that all Somalia was united with the exception of the NFD region in Kenya.

The WSLF was supported in its rebellion by the [[Somali Abo Liberation Front]] (SALF), whose sphere of operations was in the provinces of [[Bale province (Ethiopia)|Bale]], [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]], and [[Arsi Province|Arsi]], where it advocated union with Somalia or the creation of an independent state. Somalia equipped both groups with Soviet arms, and later with the Somali Army. Both groups also received aid and training from various Arab and socialist states, including Cuba.

Although the Ethiopian army outnumbered the Somalis by at least 3 to 1, the Somali army had much more air-superiority than the Ethiopians and was much better equipped. However, after massive Soviet support stopped and the United States did not accept the military support that Somalia had requested, the WSLF was forced later to retreat to camps in Somalia Proper after Soviet-supported and Cuban-armed Ethiopian and Cuban soldiers pushed back the WSLF and the Somali Army.

The Somali government subsequently forbade the WSLF and its leaders to use its territory to launch attacks into Ethiopia. By 1989 the WSLF had ceased to be an effective guerrilla organization within Ethiopia. Siad Barre's decision to restrict the WSLF, led to the exile of Yusuf Dheere in 1989 and to the formation of a WSLF splinter group, the [[Ogaden National Liberation Front]] (ONLF), whose headquarters were in [[Kuwait]]. Elements of the ONLF slipped back into the Ogaden in 1988, where they still operate. However, not everyone was happy with the ONLF because of its name (Ogaden rather than Somali), therefore many of the original WSLF supporters formed the [[United Western Somali Front]] which also includes some former ONLF members.

{{Expand German|Zersetzung (Ministerium für Staatssicherheit)|date=July 2014}}

'''''Zersetzung''''' (German; variously translated as ''decomposition, corrosion, undermining, biodegradation'' or ''dissolution'') is a [[Psychological warfare|psychological warfare technique]] that was first used by [[Nazi Germany]] as part of the accusation [[Wehrkraftzersetzung|Wehrkraft''zersetzung'']] against political opponents (which typically resulted in death penalties){{dubious|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--See talk, section "Mix-up with the Nazi accusation"--&gt;. Decades later, during the [[Erich Honecker|Honecker]] era, the [[Stasi]], the [[East Germany|East German]] secret police used the accusation ''Zersetzung'' to silence political opponents by repression.

The "measures of ''Zersetzung''", defined in the framework of a directive on police procedures in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic. ''Directive No. 1/76 on the Development and Revision of Operational Procedures [http://www.bstu.bund.de/DE/Wissen/MfS-Dokumente/Downloads/Grundsatzdokumente/richtlinie-1-76_ov.html Richtlinie Nr. 1/76 zur Entwicklung und Bearbeitung Operativer Vorgänge (OV)]''&lt;/ref&gt; were used in the context of so-called "operational procedures" (in German ''Operative Vorgänge'' or ''OV'').  They replaced the overt terror of the [[Walter Ulbricht|Ulbricht]] era.

The practice of repression in ''Zersetzung'' comprised extensive and secret methods of [[Abusive power and control|control]] and [[psychological manipulation]], including personal relationships of the target, for which the Stasi relied on its network of [[Informal collaborators (East Germany)|informal collaborators]],&lt;ref&gt;Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former German Democratic Republic: [http://www.bstu.bund.de/EN/MinistryOfStateSecurity/UnofficialCollaboratorsOfMfS/_node.html The Unofficial Collaborators (IM) of the MfS]&lt;/ref&gt; (in German ''inoffizielle Mitarbeiter'' or ''IM''), the State's power over institutions, and on [[operational psychology]]. Using targeted psychological attacks the Stasi tried to deprive a dissident of any chance of a "hostile action".

The use of ''Zersetzung'' is well documented due to numerous Stasi files published after East Germany's [[Die Wende|Wende]]. Several thousands or up to 10,000 individuals are estimated to have become victims,&lt;ref name="Süß"&gt;Sonja Süß: ''Repressive Strukturen in der SBZ/DDR – Analyse von Strategien der Zersetzung durch Staatsorgane der DDR gegenüber Bürgern der DDR.''

==Definition==
The [[Stasi]], or Ministry for State Security (German: Ministerium für Staatssicherheit, MfS) by its full name, defined ''Zersetzung'' in its 1985 dictionary of political operatives as 

{{quote|... a method of operation by the Ministry for State Security for an efficacious struggle against [[subversive activities]], particularly in the treatment of operations.  With ''Zersetzung'' one can influence hostile and negative individuals across different operational political activities, especially the hostile and negative aspects of their dispositions and beliefs, so these are abandoned and changed little by little, and, if applicable, the contradictions and differences between the hostile and negative forces would be laid open, exploited, and reinforced.

The goal of ''Zersetzung'' is the fragmentation, paralysis, disorganization, and isolation of the hostile and negative forces, in order to preventatively impede the hostile and negative activities, to largely restrict, or to totally avert them, and if applicable to prepare the ground for a political and ideological reestablishment.

''Zersetzung'' is equally an immediate constitutive element of "operational procedures" and other preventive activities to impede hostile gatherings.  The principal forces to execute ''Zersetzung'' are the unofficial collaborators.  ''Zersetzung'' presupposes information and significant proof of hostile activities planned, prepared, and accomplished as well as anchor points corresponding to measures of ''Zersetzung''.

''Zersetzung'' must be produced on the basis of a root cause analysis of the facts and the exact definition of a concrete goal.  ''Zersetzung'' must be executed in a uniform and supervised manner; its results must be documented.

The political explosive force of ''Zersetzung'' heightens demands regarding the maintenance of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry for Security of State, ''Dictionary of political and operational work'', entry ''Zersetzung'': Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (Hrsg.): ''Wörterbuch zur politisch-operativen Arbeit'', 2. Auflage (1985), Stichwort: "Zersetzung", GVS JHS 001-400/81, {{p.|464}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Political context==
During its first decade of existence, the [[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR) subdued political opponents primarily through the [[penal code]], by accusing them of incitement to war or of calls of boycott.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Schröder: ''[http://www.rewi.hu-berlin.de/online/fhi/articles/0404schroeder.htm Geschichte des DDR-Rechts: Straf- und Verwaltungsrecht] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311194158/http://www.rewi.hu-berlin.de/online/fhi/articles/0404schroeder.htm |date=March 11, 2008 }}'', forum historiae iuris, 6 avril 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  To counteract the international isolation of the GDR following the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, judicial terror was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Falco Werkentin]]: ''Recht und Justiz im SED-Staat''. Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, Bonn 1998, 2. durchgesehene Auflage 2000, S. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; From the start of the [[Erich Honecker]] era in 1971 in particular, the Stasi intensified its efforts to punish [[dissident]] behaviors without using the penal code.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Pingel-Schliemann: ''Zerstörung von Biografien. Zersetzung als Phänomen der Honecker-Ära''. In: Eckart Conze/Katharina Gajdukowa/Sigrid Koch-Baumgarten (Hrsg.): ''Die demokratische Revolution 1989 in der DDR''. Köln 2009, S. 78–91.&lt;/ref&gt; Important motives were the GDR's desire for international recognition, and for [[rapprochement]] with West Germany, at the end of the 1960s. In fact the GDR was committed to adhere to the [[U.N. Charter]]&lt;ref&gt;Art. 1 Abs. 3 UN-Charta. Dokumentiert in: 12. Deutscher Bundestag: ''Materialien der Enquete-Kommission zur Aufarbeitung von Geschichte und Folgen der SED-Diktatur in Deutschland''. Band 4, Frankfurt a. M. 1995, S. 547.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Helsinki accords]],&lt;ref&gt;Konferenz über Sicherheit und Zusammenarbeit in Europa, Schlussakte, Helsinki 1975, S. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Basic Treaty, 1972]], signed with the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;Art. 2 des ''Vertrages über die Grundlagen der Beziehungen zwischen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik'' vom 21. Dezember 1972''. In: Matthias Judt (Hrsg.): ''DDR-Geschichte in Dokumenten – Beschlüsse, Berichte, interne Materialien und Alltagszeugnisse''. Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung Bd. 350, Bonn 1998, S. 517.&lt;/ref&gt; to respect human rights, or at least announce its intention to do so. Consequently, the regime of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] decided to reduce the number of political prisoners, which was compensated for by practising repression without imprisonment or court judgements.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Raschka: ''"Staatsverbrechen werden nicht genannt" – Zur Zahl politischer Häftlinge während der Amtszeit Honeckers''. In: ''Deutschlandarchiv''. Band 30, Nummer 1, 1997, S. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jens Raschka: ''Einschüchterung, Ausgrenzung, Verfolgung – Zur politischen Repression in der Amtszeit Honeckers''. Berichte und Studien, Band 14, Dresden 1998, S. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In practice==
The Stasi used ''Zersetzung'' essentially as a means of [[psychological]] oppression and persecution.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus-Dietmar Henke: Zur Nutzung und Auswertung der Stasi-Akten. In: Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte. Nummer 4, 1993, S. 586.&lt;/ref&gt; Findings of [[operational psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;Süß: Strukturen. S. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; were formulated into method at the Stasi's College of Law (''Juristische Hochschule der Staatssicherheit'', or ''JHS''), and applied to [[political opponent]]s in an effort to undermine their self-confidence and self-esteem. Operations were designed to intimidate and destabilise them by subjecting them to repeated disappointment, and to socially alienate them by interfering with and disrupting their relationships with others as in [[social undermining]]. The aim was to induce [[personal crisis|personal crises]] in victims, leaving them too unnerved and psychologically distressed to have the time and energy for anti-government activism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: Zersetzen. S. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stasi intentionally concealed their role as mastermind of the operations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Jens Gieseke: Mielke-Konzern. S. 192f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: Formen. S. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Jürgen Fuchs (writer)|Jürgen Fuchs]] was a victim of ''Zersetzung'' and wrote about his experience, describing the Stasi's actions as "[[psychosocial]] crime", and "an assault on the human soul".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Although its techniques had been established effectively by the late 1950s, ''Zersetzung'' was not rigorously defined until the mid-1970s, and only then began to be carried out in a systematic manner in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Süß: Strukturen. S. 202-204.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to determine how many people were targeted, since the sources have been deliberately and considerably redacted; it is known, however, that tactics varied in scope, and that a number of different departments implemented them. Overall there was a ratio of four or five authorised ''Zersetzung'' operators for each targeted group, and three for each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Süß: Strukturen. S. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources indicate that around 5,000 people were "persistently victimised" by ''Zersetzung''.&lt;ref name="Beleites"/&gt; At the College of Legal Studies, the number of dissertations submitted on the subject of ''Zersetzung'' was in double figures.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Förster: Die Dissertationen an der "Juristischen Hochschule" des MfS. Eine annotierte Bibliographie. BStU, Berlin 1997, Online-Quelle (Memento vom 13. Juli 2009 im Internet Archive).&lt;/ref&gt; It also had a comprehensive 50-page ''Zersetzung'' teaching manual, which included numerous examples of its practice.&lt;ref&gt;Anforderungen und Wege für eine konzentrierte, offensive, rationelle und gesellschaftlich wirksame Vorgangsbearbeitung. Juristische Hochschule Potsdam 1977, BStU, ZA, JHS 24 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementing institutions ===

Almost all Stasi departments were involved in ''Zersetzung'' operations, although first and foremost amongst these was the headquarters of the Stasi's directorate XX (''Hauptabteilung XX'') in Berlin, and its divisional offices in regional and municipal government. The function of the headquarters and ''Abteilung XX''s was to maintain surveillance of [[Christianity in East Germany|religious communities]]; cultural and media establishments; [[Bloc party (politics)|alternative political parties]]; the GDR's many political establishment-affiliated mass social organisations; sport; and [[Education in East Germany|education]] and health services - effectively covering all aspects of civic life.&lt;ref&gt;Jens Gieseke: Das Ministerium für Staatssicherheit 1950–1989/90 – Ein kurzer historischer Abriss. In: BF informiert. Nr. 21, Berlin 1998, S. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stasi made use of the means available to them within, and as a circumstance of, the GDR's closed social system. An established, politically motivated collaborative network (''politisch-operatives Zusammenwirken'', or ''POZW'') provided them with extensive opportunities for interference in such situations as the sanctioning of professionals and students, expulsion from associations and sports clubs, and occasional arrests by the ''[[Volkspolizei]]''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; (the GDR's quasi-military national police). Refusal of [[Visa (document)|permits for travel]] to [[Real socialism|socialist]] states, or denial of entry at [[Czechoslovakia]]n and [[Polish People's Republic|Polish]] border crossings where no visa requirement existed, were also arranged. The various collaborators (''Partnern des operativen Zusammenwirkens'') included branches of regional government, university and professional management, housing administrative bodies, the ''Sparkasse'' public savings bank, and in some cases head physicians.&lt;ref&gt;Hubertus Knabe: Zersetzungsmaßnahmen. In: Karsten Dümmel, Christian Schmitz (Hrsg.): Was war die Stasi? KAS, Zukunftsforum Politik Nr. 43, Sankt Augustin 2002, S. 31, PDF, 646 KB.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stasi's ''Linie III'' (''Observation''), ''Abteilung 2''6 (Telephone and room surveillance) and ''M'' (Postal communications) departments provided essential background information for the designing of ''Zersetzung'' techniques, with ''Abteilung 32'' procuring the required technology.&lt;ref&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: Zersetzen, S. 141–151.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stasi collaborated with the secret services of other Eastern Bloc countries to implement ''Zersetzung''. One such example was the Polish secret services co-operating against branches of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] organisation in the early 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dirksen |first=Hans-Hermann |date=19 August 2006 |title='All over the world Jehovah's Witnesses are the touchstone for the existence of true democracy': Persecution of a religious minority in the German Democratic Republic |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09637490600624808?src=recsys&amp;journalCode=crss20 |journal=Religion, State and Society |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=127–143 |doi=10.1080/09637490600624808 |publisher=Routledge |access-date=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would come to be known&lt;ref&gt;Waldemar Hirch: Zusammenarbeit zwischen dem ostdeutschen und dem polnischen Geheimdienst zum Zweck der "Zersetzung" der Zeugen Jehovas. In: Waldemar Hirch, Martin Jahn, Johannes Wrobel (Hrsg.): Zersetzung einer Religionsgemeinschaft: die geheimdienstliche Bearbeitung der Zeugen Jehovas in der DDR und in Polen. Niedersteinbach 2001, S. 84–95.&lt;/ref&gt; as "''innere Zersetzung''"&lt;ref&gt;Aus einem Protokoll vom 16. Mai 1963, zit. n. Sebastian Koch: Die Zeugen Jehovas in Ostmittel-, Südost- und Südeuropa: Zum Schicksal einer Religionsgemeinschaft. Berlin 2007, S. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; (internal subversion).

===Against individuals===
The Stasi applied ''Zersetzung'' before, during, after, or instead of incarcerating the targeted individual.  The implementation of ''Zersetzung'' — euphemistically called ''Operativer Vorgang'' ("operational procedure") – generally did not aim to gather evidence against the target in order to initiate criminal proceedings.  Rather, the Stasi considered ''Zersetzung'' as a separate measure to be used when official judiciary procedures were undesirable for political reasons, such as the international image of the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;''Richtlinie 1/76 zur Entwicklung und Bearbeitung Operativer Vorgänge vom 1. Januar 1976''. Dokumentiert in: David Gill, Ulrich Schröter: ''Das Ministerium für Staatssicherheit. Anatomie des Mielke-Imperiums''. S. 390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehrmaterial der Hochschule des MfS: ''Anforderungen und Wege für eine konzentrierte, rationelle und gesellschaftlich wirksame Vorgangsbearbeitung.'' Kapitel 11: ''Die Anwendung von Maßnahmen der Zersetzung in der Bearbeitung Operativer Vorgänge'' vom Dezember 1977, BStU, ZA, JHS 24 503, S. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in certain cases, the Stasi did attempt to entrap individuals, as for example in the case of [[Wolf Biermann]]: The Stasi set him up with minors, hoping that they could then pursue criminal charges.&lt;ref name="mielkekonzern_195f"&gt;Gieseke: ''Mielke-Konzern''. S. 195f.&lt;/ref&gt;  The crimes targeted for such entrapment were non-political, such as drug possession, trafficking, theft, financial fraud, and rape.&lt;ref name="ps_phaenomen_82f"&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: ''Phänomen''. S. 82f.&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#E9F7FF; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 25%;" cellspacing="5"
|style="text-align: left;"| …the Stasi often used a method which was really diabolic. It was called Zersetzung, and it's described in another guideline. The word is difficult to translate because it means originally "biodegradation." But actually, it's a quite accurate description. The goal was to destroy secretly the self-confidence of people, for example by damaging their reputation, by organizing failures in their work, and by destroying their personal relationships. Considering this, East Germany was a very modern dictatorship. The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident. It preferred to paralyze them, and it could do so because it had access to so much personal information and to so many institutions.

Directive 1/76 lists the following as tried and tested forms of ''Zersetzung'', among others:

{{quote|a systematic degradation of reputation, image, and prestige on the basis of true, verifiable and discrediting information together with untrue, credible, irrefutable, and thus also discrediting information; a systematic engineering of social and professional failures to undermine the self-confidence of individuals; ... engendering of doubts regarding future prospects; engendering of mistrust and mutual suspicion within groups  ...; interrupting respectively impeding the mutual relations within a group in space or time ..., for example by ... assigning geographically distant workplaces.|Directive No. 1/76 of January 1976 for the development of "operational procedures".&lt;ref&gt;Roger Engelmann, Frank Joestel: ''Grundsatzdokumente des MfS''.

Teil V/5, Berlin 2004, S. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beginning with intelligence obtained by espionage, the Stasi established "sociograms" and "psychograms" which it applied for the psychological forms of ''Zersetzung''.  They exploited personal traits, such as homosexuality, as well as supposed character weaknesses of the targeted individual — for example a professional failure, negligence of parental duties, pornographic interests, divorce, alcoholism, dependence on medications, criminal tendencies, passion for a collection or a game, or contacts with circles of the extreme right — or even the veil of shame from the rumors poured out upon one's circle of acquaintances.&lt;ref name="knabe_jhs1978"&gt;Knabe: ''Zersetzungsmaßnahmen''. S. 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arbeit der Juristischen Hochschule der Staatssicherheit in Potsdam aus dem Jahr 1978, MDA, MfS, JHS GVS 001-11/78. In: Pingel-Schliemann: ''Formen''. S. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; From the point of view of the Stasi, the measures were the most fruitful when they were applied in connection with a personality; all "schematism" had to be avoided.&lt;ref name="knabe_jhs1978" /&gt;

Moreover, methods of ''Zersetzung'' included espionage, overt, hidden, and feigned; opening letters and listening to telephone calls; encroachments on private property; manipulation of vehicles; and even poisoning food and using false medications.&lt;ref&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: ''Zersetzen''. S. 266–278.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain collaborators of the Stasi tacitly took into account the suicide of victims of ''Zersetzung''.&lt;ref&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: ''Zersetzen''. S. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has not been definitely established that the Stasi used X-rays to provoke long-term health problems in its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: ''Zersetzen'', S. 280f.&lt;/ref&gt; That said, Rudolf Bahro, Gerulf Pannach, and Jürgen Fuchs, three important dissidents who had been imprisoned at the same time, died of cancer within an interval of two years.&lt;ref&gt;Der Spiegel 20/1999: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13395385.html In Kopfhöhe ausgerichtet]'' ([http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=13395385&amp;aref=image019/E9920/SP199902000420044.pdf&amp;thumb=false PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518060908/http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=13395385&amp;aref=image019/E9920/SP199902000420044.pdf&amp;thumb=false |date=May 18, 2013 }}, 697&amp;nbsp;KB), S. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;  A study by the Federal Commissioner for the Records of the State Security Service of the former GDR (''Bundesbeauftragte für die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik'' or ''BStU'') has meanwhile rejected on the basis of extant documents such as fraudulent use of X-rays, and only mentions isolated and unintentional cases of the harmful use of sources of radiation, for example to mark documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stiftung-hsh.de/curriculum_old/einsatz_von_roentgenstrahlen_und.htm Kurzdarstellung] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726090101/http://www.stiftung-hsh.de/curriculum_old/einsatz_von_roentgenstrahlen_und.htm |date=July 26, 2014 }} des Berichtes der Projektgruppe "Strahlen" beim BStU zum Thema: "Einsatz von Röntgenstrahlen und radioaktiven Stoffen durch das MfS gegen Oppositionelle – Fiktion oder Realität?", Berlin 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the name of the target, the Stasi made little announcements, ordered products, and made emergency calls, to terrorize him/her.&lt;ref&gt;[[Udo Scheer]]: ''Jürgen Fuchs – Ein literarischer Weg in die Opposition''. Berlin 2007, S. 344f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mielkekonzern_196f"&gt;Gieseke: ''Mielke-Konzern''. S. 196f.&lt;/ref&gt; To threaten or intimidate or cause psychoses the Stasi assured itself of access to the target's living quarters and left visible traces of its presence, by adding, removing, and modifying objects.&lt;ref name="ps_phaenomen_82f" /&gt;

===Against groups and social relations===
The Stasi manipulated relations of friendship, love, marriage, and family by anonymous letters, telegrams and telephone calls as well as compromising photos, often altered.&lt;ref&gt;Gisela Schütte: ''[https://www.welt.de/die-welt/regionales/hamburg/article8770512/Die-unsichtbaren-Wunden-der-Stasi-Opfer.html Die unsichtbaren Wunden der Stasi-Opfer]''. In: ''Die Welt''. 2. August 2010, eingesehen am 8. August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, parents and children were supposed to systematically become strangers to one another.&lt;ref&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: ''Zersetzen'', S. 254–257.&lt;/ref&gt; To provoke conflicts and extramarital relations the Stasi put in place targeted seductions by Romeo agents.&lt;ref name="mielkekonzern_195f" /&gt;

For the ''Zersetzung'' of groups, it infiltrated them with unofficial collaborators, sometimes minors.&lt;ref&gt;Axel Kintzinger: ''[http://www.zeit.de/1998/41/Ich_kann_keinen_mehr_umarmen „Ich kann keinen mehr umarmen“]''. In: ''Die Zeit''. Nummer 41, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of opposition groups was hindered by permanent counter-propositions and discord on the part of unofficial collaborators when making decisions.&lt;ref name="ps_358f"&gt;Pingel-Schliemann: ''Zersetzen'', S. 358f.&lt;/ref&gt; To sow mistrust within the group, the Stasi made believe that certain members were unofficial collaborators; moreover by spreading rumors and manipulated photos,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stefan Wolle]]: ''Die heile Welt der Diktatur. Alltag und Herrschaft in der DDR 1971–1989''. Bonn 1999, S. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; the Stasi feigned indiscretions with unofficial collaborators, or placed members of targeted groups in administrative posts to make believe that this was a reward for the activity of an unofficial collaborator.&lt;ref name="mielkekonzern_195f" /&gt; They even aroused suspicions regarding certain members of the group by assigning privileges, such as housing or a personal car.&lt;ref name="mielkekonzern_195f" /&gt; Moreover, the imprisonment of only certain members of the group gave birth to suspicions.&lt;ref name="ps_358f"/&gt;

===Methods===
{{further|Sneak and peek warrant}}
Tactics employed under ''Zersetzung'' generally involved the disruption of the victim's private or family life. This often included psychological attacks, such as breaking into homes and subtly manipulating the contents, in a form of [[gaslighting]] – moving furniture, altering the timing of an alarm, removing pictures from walls or replacing one variety of tea with another. Other practices included property damage, sabotage of cars, purposely incorrect medical treatment, [[smear campaign]]s including sending falsified compromising photos or documents to the victim's family, [[False accusation|denunciation]], [[Agent provocateur|provocation]], [[psychological warfare]], [[psychological subversion]], [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping]], [[Covert listening device|bugging]], mysterious phone calls or unnecessary deliveries, even including sending a [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]] to a target's wife.

Returning items from the trash to the home, releasing mice or poisonous snakes (especially those whose poison works on contact and need not be [[envenomation|injected]]) in walls or basements and alluding to topics referenced in tapped phone conversations is also popular, as is filling both the salt and pepper shakers with 'pepper'; (in a controlled or export economy, as in times of economic hardship generally, ersatz pepper is typically made of sawdust-type substitutes such as bark or for example '[[winter's bark|winter pepper]]'; see especially '[[Itching powder|witzpulver]]' but also '[[monk's pepper]]').  Usually, victims had no idea that the Stasi were responsible and indeed, it is probable that they not always were. Many thought that they were losing their minds, and mental breakdowns and suicide could result. The 'dissolution' is likely at least occasionally intended to carry the same connotation as in such uses as '[[dissolution of marriage]],' 'breakdown of the traditional family unit,' etc.  It should perhaps be noted further that no one had a monopoly on monitoring communications, whether in East Germany or anywhere else.

==Target groups for measures==
The Stasi used ''Zersetzung'' tactics on individuals and groups. There was no particular homogeneous target group, as opposition in the GDR came from a number of different sources. Tactical plans were thus separately adapted to each perceived threat.&lt;ref&gt;Kollektivdissertation der Juristischen Hochschule der Staatssicherheit in Potsdam. In: Pingel-Schliemann: Zersetzen. S. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stasi nevertheless defined several main target groups:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

* associations of people making collective visa applications for travel abroad
* artists' groups critical of the government
* religious opposition groups
* youth subculture groups
* groups supporting the above (human rights and peace organisations, those assisting illegal departure from the GDR, and expatriate and defector movements).

The Stasi also occasionally used ''Zersetzung'' on non-political organisations regarded as undesirable, such as the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watchtower Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Mike Dennis: Surviving the Stasi: Jehovah's Witnesses in Communist East Germany, 1965 to 1989. In: Religion, State and Society. Band 34, Nummer 2, 2006, S. 145-168&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent individuals targeted by ''Zersetzung'' operations included [[Jürgen Fuchs (writer)|Jürgen Fuchs]], Gerulf Pannach, Rudolf Bahro, [[Robert Havemann]], Rainer Eppelmann, [[Reiner Kunze]], husband and wife Gerd and [[Ulrike Poppe]], and [[Wolfgang Templin]].

== Social and juridicial process ==
Once aware of his own status as a target, GDR opponent Wolfgang Templin tried, with some success, to bring details of the Stasi's ''Zersetzung'' activities to the attention of western journalists.&lt;ref name="Gieseke: Mielke-Konzern. S. 196f"&gt;Gieseke: Mielke-Konzern. S. 196f.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' published a five-part article series, "''Du sollst zerbrechen!''" ("You're going to crack!"), by the exiled Jürgen Fuchs, in which he describes the Stasi's "operational psychology". The Stasi tried to [[Disinformation|discredit]] Fuchs and the contents of similar articles, publishing in turn claims that he had a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] view of its function,&lt;ref&gt;Scheer: Fuchs. S. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; and intending that ''Der Spiegel'' and other media would assume he was suffering from a persecution complex.&lt;ref name="Gieseke: Mielke-Konzern. S. 196f"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treffbericht des IMB "J. Herold" mit Oberleutnant Walther vom 25. März 1986 über ein Gespräch mit dem "abgeschöpften" SPIEGEL-Redakteur Ulrich Schwarz. Dok. in Jürgen Fuchs: Magdalena. MfS, Memphisblues, Stasi, Die Firma, VEB Horch &amp; Gauck – Ein Roman. Berlin 1998, S. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; This, however, was refuted by the official Stasi documents examined after ''[[Die Wende]]'' (the political power shift in the GDR in 1989-90).

Because the scale and nature of ''Zersetzung'' were unknown both to the general population of the GDR and to people abroad, revelations of the Stasi's malicious tactics were met with some degree of disbelief by those affected.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Vgl. Interviews mit Sandra Pingel-Schliemann (PDF; 114 kB) und Gisela Freimarck (PDF; 80 kB).&lt;/ref&gt; Many still nowadays express incomprehension at how the Stasi's collaborators could have participated in such inhuman actions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Since ''Zersetzung'' as a whole, even after 1990, was not deemed to be illegal because of the principle of ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (no penalty without law), actions against involvement in either its planning or implementation were [[Law enforcement|not enforceable by the courts]].&lt;ref&gt;Interview mit der Bundesbeauftragten für die Stasi-Unterlagen Marianne Birthler im Deutschlandradio Kultur vom 25. April 2006: Birthler: Ex-Stasi-Offiziere wollen Tatsachen verdrehen, eingesehen am 7. August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Because this specific legal definition of ''Zersetzung'' as a crime didn't exist,&lt;ref&gt;Renate Oschlies: Die Straftat "Zersetzung" kennen die Richter nicht. In: Berliner Zeitung. 8. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; only individual instances of its tactics could be reported. Acts which even according to GDR law were offences (such as the violation of ''[[Secrecy of correspondence|Briefgeheimnis]]'', the secrecy of correspondence) needed to have been reported to the GDR authorities soon after having been committed in order not to be subject to a statute of limitations clause.&lt;ref&gt;Hubertus Knabe: Die Täter sind unter uns – Über das Schönreden der SED-Diktatur. Berlin 2007, S. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the victims experienced the additional complication that the Stasi was not identifiable as the originator in cases of personal injury and misadventure. Official documents in which ''Zersetzung'' methods were recorded often had no validity in court, and the Stasi had many files detailing its actual implementation destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk: Stasi konkret – Überwachung und Repression in der DDR, München 2013, S. 211, 302f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless they had been detained for at least 180 days, survivors of ''Zersetzung'' operations, in accordance with §17a of a 1990 rehabilitation act (the ''Strafrechtlichen Rehabilitierungsgesetzes'', or ''StrRehaG''), are not eligible for financial compensation. Cases of provable, systematically effected targeting by the Stasi, and resulting in employment-related losses and/or health damage, can be pursued under a law covering settlement of torts (''Unrechtsbereinigungsgesetz'', or ''2. SED-UnBerG'') as claims either for occupational rehabilitation or rehabilitation under administrative law. These overturn certain administrative provisions of GDR institutions and affirm their unconstitutionality. This is a condition for the social equalisation payments specified in the ''Bundesversorgungsgesetz'' (the war victims relief act of 1950). Equalisation payments of pension damages and for loss of earnings can also be applied for in cases where victimisation continued for at least three years, and where claimants can prove need.&lt;ref&gt;Stasiopfer.de: Was können zur Zeit sogenannte "Zersetzungsopfer" beantragen?, PDF, 53 KB, eingesehen am 24. August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The above examples of seeking justice have, however, been hindered by various difficulties victims have experienced, both [[Philosophic burden of proof|in providing proof]] of the Stasi's encroachment into the areas of health, personal assets, education and employment, and in receiving official acknowledgement that the Stasi was responsible for personal damages (including psychic injury) as a direct result of ''Zersetzung'' operations.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Siegmund: Die Verbesserung rehabilitierungsrechtlicher Vorschriften – Handlungsbedarf, Lösungskonzepte, Realisierungschancen, Bundesstiftung Aufarbeitung, Symposium zur Verbesserung der Unterstützung der Opfer der SED-Diktatur vom 10. Mai 2006, PDF (Memento vom 28. November 2010 im Internet Archive), 105 KB, S. 3, eingesehen am 24. August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of similar techniques in other countries==
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the American [[FBI]] came to fully appreciate and utilize Zersetzung against perceived "subversives". [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] was a regular target of public scorn, innuendo and other active measures by [[J. Edgar Hoover|Edgar Hoover]]'s FBI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/encyclopedia/enc_federal_bureau_of_investigation_fbi/], Stanford.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Russia]]'s security and intelligence agencies were reported to use similar actions against foreign diplomats and journalists in Russia and other [[Post-Soviet states|ex-USSR states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/aug/4/russia-uses-dirty-tricks-despite-us-reset/#pagebreak Russia uses dirty tricks despite U.S. 'reset']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/23/russia-targeting-western-diplomats Russian spy agency targeting western diplomats], The Guardian, 2011-7-23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=As applied by the Stasi, Zersetzung is a technique to subvert and undermine an opponent. The aim was to disrupt the target's private or family life so they are unable to continue their "hostile-negative" activities towards the state. Typically, the Stasi would use collaborators to garner details from a victim's private life. They would then devise a strategy to "disintegrate" the target's personal circumstances – their career, their relationship with their spouse, their reputation in the community. They would even seek to alienate them from their children. Pingel-Schliemann cites the case of Herr J. First Herr J lost his driver's licence. Months later he found anonymous notes insulting him hanging on the trees of his village. Then rumours circulated that he was cheating on his wife. At work Herr J faced growing problems. Finally, the police arrested him and sentenced him for a theft he didn't commit. To Herr J, these events were disturbing, random and inexplicable. He had no inkling that the Stasi were behind them. The security service's goal was to use Zersetzung to "switch off" regime opponents. After months and even years of Zersetzung a victim's domestic problems grew so large, so debilitating, and so psychologically burdensome that they would lose the will to struggle against the East German state. Best of all, the Stasi's role in the victim's personal misfortunes remained tantalisingly hidden. The Stasi operations were carried out in complete operational secrecy. The service acted like an unseen and malevolent god, manipulating the destinies of its victims.|sign=Luke Harding|source=Mafia State: How one reporter became an enemy of the brutal new Russia}}

In 2016, Zersetzung-like harassment was reported by the American press as carried out by Russia's [[List of intelligence agencies#Russian Federation|secret services]] against U.S. diplomats posted in Moscow as well as in unspecified "several other European capitals"; the U.S. government's efforts to raise the issue with the Kremlin were said to have brought no positive reaction.&lt;ref name="harass"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/russia-is-harassing-us-diplomats-all-over-europe/2016/06/26/968d1a5a-3bdf-11e6-84e8-1580c7db5275_story.html?tid=ss_fb|title=Russia is harassing U.S. diplomats all over Europe|last=Rogin|first=Josh|date=2016-06-26|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Embassy's reply was cited by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as implicitly admitting and defending the harassment as a response to what Russia called U.S. provocations and mistreatment of Russian diplomats in the United States.&lt;ref name="harass" /&gt; The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)|Russian Foreign Ministry]]'s spokesperson in turn accused the U.S.' FBI and CIA of provocations and "psychological pressure" vis-a-vis the Russian diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/russian/news-36652455 Захарова: ФБР и ЦРУ постоянно провоцируют российских дипломатов] BBC, 28 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
