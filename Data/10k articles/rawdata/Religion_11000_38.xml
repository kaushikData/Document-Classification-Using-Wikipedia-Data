The choice of black as the colour of the Abbasid Revolution was already motivated by the "black standards out of Khorasan" tradition associated with the [[Mahdi]]. The contrast of white vs. black as the Umayyad vs. Abbasid dynastic colour over time developed in white as the colour of Shia Islam and black as the colour of Sunni Islam: "The proselytes of the ʿAbbasid revolution took full advantage of the eschatological expectations raised by black banners in their campaign to undermine the Umayyad dynasty from within. Even after the ʿAbbasids had triumphed over the Umayyads in 750, they continued to deploy black as their dynastic colour; not only the banners but the headdresses and garments of the ʿAbbasid caliphs were black [...] The ubiquitous black created a striking contrast with the banners and dynastic color of the Umayyads, which had been white [...] The Ismaili Shiʿite counter-caliphate founded by the Fatimids took white as its dynastic color, creating a visual contrast to the ʿAbbasid enemy [...] white became the Shiʿite color, in deliberate opposition to the black of the ʿAbbasid 'establishment'."

{{History of the Arab States}}
The '''Abbasid Caliphate''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|b|æ|s|ɪ|d|}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|b|ə|s|ɪ|d|}} {{lang-ar|ٱلْخِلافَةُ ٱلْعَبَّاسِيَّة}}, ''{{transl|ar|al-Khilāfatu al-ʿAbbāsiyyah}}'') was the third of the [[Islam]]ic [[caliphates]] to succeed the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]]. It was founded by a dynasty descended from Muhammad's uncle, [[Abbas ibn Abdul-Muttalib]] (566–653 CE), from whom the dynasty takes its name.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} They ruled as [[caliphs]] for most of the caliphate from their capital in [[Round city of Baghdad|Baghdad]] in modern-day [[Iraq]], after having overthrown the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the [[Abbasid Revolution]] of 750 CE (132&amp;nbsp;[[anno Hegirae|AH]]).

The Abbasid Caliphate first centred its government in [[Kufa]], modern-day Iraq, but in 762 the caliph [[Al-Mansur]] founded the city of Baghdad, near the ancient [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] capital city of [[Ctesiphon]]. The Abbasid period was marked by reliance on [[Greater Iran|Persian]] [[bureaucrat]]s (notably the [[Barmakids|Barmakid]] family) for governing the territories as well as an increasing inclusion of [[Mawla|non-Arab Muslims]] in the ''[[ummah]]'' (national community). [[Persianate customs]] were broadly adopted by the ruling elite, and they began patronage of artists and scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canfield|first1=Robert L.|title=Turko-Persia in Historical Perspective|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521522915|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baghdad became a centre of science, culture, philosophy and invention in what became known as the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]].

Despite this initial cooperation, the Abbasids of the late 8th century had alienated both non-Arab ''[[mawali]]'' (clients)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ABŪ MOSLEM ḴORĀSĀNĪ – Encyclopaedia Iranica|url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-moslem-abd-al-rahman-b|website = www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151122132055/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abu-moslem-abd-al-rahman-b#|archive-date = 22 November 2015|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Iranian bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The History of Government from the Earliest Times: Volume II: The Intermediate Ages p.720|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AhEab85xHAMC|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 1999-01-01|isbn = 9780198207900|first = S.

The political power of the caliphs largely ended with the rise of the Iranian [[Buyids]] and the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq Turks]], which each captured Baghdad in 945 and 1055 respectively. Although Abbasid leadership over the vast [[Islamic empire]] was gradually reduced to a ceremonial religious function, the dynasty retained control over its [[Mesopotamian]] domain. The Abbasids' period of cultural fruition ended in 1258 with the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|sack of Baghdad]] by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] under [[Hulagu Khan]]. The Abbasid line of rulers, and Muslim culture in general, re-centred themselves in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] capital of [[Cairo]] in 1261. Though lacking in political power, the dynasty continued to claim religious authority until after the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|conquest of Egypt]] in 1517.{{sfn|Holt|1984}}

==History==

===Abbasid Revolution (750–751)===
{{main article|Abbasid Revolution}}
The Abbasid caliphs were [[Arab people|Arab]]s descended from [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]], one of the youngest uncles of Muhammad and of the same [[Banu Hashim]] clan. The Abbasids claimed to be the true successors of Prophet Muhammad in replacing the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] descendants of [[Umayya ibn Abd Shams|Banu Umayya]] by virtue of their closer bloodline to Muhammad.

The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking their moral character and administration in general. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], "The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of [[Merv]] with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]".{{sfn|Lapidus|2002|p=54}} The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the kinship-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. [[Mohammad ibn Ali Abbasi|Muhammad ibn 'Ali]], a great-grandson of Abbas, began to campaign in [[Greater Persia|Persia]] for the return of power to the family of Prophet Muhammad, the [[Hashimites]], during the reign of [[Umar II]].

During the reign of [[Marwan II]], this opposition culminated in the rebellion of Ibrahim the Imam, the fourth in descent from Abbas. Supported by the province of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] (Eastern Persia), even though the governor opposed them, and the Shia Arabs,{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}} he achieved considerable success, but was captured in the year 747 and died, possibly assassinated, in prison.

On 9 June 747 (15 Ramadan AH 129), [[Abu Muslim]], rising from Khorasan, successfully initiated an open revolt against Umayyad rule, which was carried out under the sign of the [[Black Standard]]. Close to 10,000 soldiers were under Abu Muslim's command when the hostilities officially began in [[Merv (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Merv]].{{sfn|Lewis|1995|p=102}} [[Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i|General Qahtaba]] followed the fleeing governor [[Nasr ibn Sayyar]] west defeating the Umayyads at the Battle of Gorgan, the Battle of Nahāvand and finally in the Battle of Karbala, all in the year 748.{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}}

The quarrel was taken up by Ibrahim's brother Abdallah, known by the name of [[As-Saffah|Abu al-'Abbas as-Saffah]], who defeated the Umayyads in 750 in the [[Battle of the Zab|battle near the Great Zab]] and was subsequently proclaimed [[caliph]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Abbasids|volume=1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this loss, Marwan fled to Egypt, where he was subsequently assassinated. The remainder of his family, barring one male, were also eliminated.{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}}

Immediately after their victory, As-Saffah sent his forces to [[Central Asia]], where his forces fought against [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] expansion during the [[Battle of Talas]]. The noble Iranian family [[Barmakids]], who were instrumental in building [[Round city of Baghdad|Baghdad]], introduced the world's first recorded [[paper mill]] in the city, thus beginning a new era of intellectual rebirth in the Abbasid domain. As-Saffah focused on putting down numerous rebellions in Syria and Mesopotamia. The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] conducted raids during these early distractions.{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}}

[[File:Battle of Talas.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Battle of Talas]], 751]]
The first change the Abbasids, under [[Al-Mansur]], made was to move the empire's capital from [[Damascus]], in Syria, to Baghdad in Iraq. This was to both appease as well to be closer to the Persian ''mawali'' support base that existed in this region more influenced by Persian history and culture, and part of the Persian mawali demand for less Arab dominance in the empire. Baghdad was established on the [[Tigris River]] in 762. A new position, that of the [[vizier]], was also established to delegate central authority, and even greater authority was delegated to local emirs.&lt;ref name="AHGC"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This eventually meant that many Abbasid caliphs were relegated to a more ceremonial role than under the Umayyads, as the viziers began to exert greater influence, and the role of the old Arab aristocracy was slowly replaced by a Persian bureaucracy.&lt;ref name="AHGC"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Al-Mansur's time control of [[Al-Andalus]] was lost, and the Shia revolted and were defeated a year later at the [[Alid revolt of 762–763|Battle of Bakhamra]].{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}}

The Abbasids had depended heavily on the support of Persians{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} in their overthrow of the Umayyads. Abu al-'Abbas' successor, [[Al-Mansur]] welcomed non-Arab Muslims to his court. While this helped integrate Arab and Persian cultures, it alienated many of their Arab supporters, particularly the [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasanian]] Arabs who had supported them in their battles against the Umayyads.

These fissures in their support led to immediate problems. The Umayyads, while out of power, were not destroyed. The only surviving member of the Umayyad royal family, which had been all but annihilated, ultimately made his way to Spain where he established himself as an independent [[Emir]] ([[Abd ar-Rahman I]], 756). In 929, [[Abd ar-Rahman III]] assumed the title of Caliph, establishing [[Al Andalus]] from [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] as a rival to Baghdad as the legitimate capital of the Islamic Empire.

In 756, the Abbasid Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] sent over 4,000 Arab mercenaries to assist the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] in the [[An Shi Rebellion]] against [[An Lushan]]. The Abbasides or "Black Flags," as they were commonly called, were known in Tang dynasty chronicles as the ''hēiyī Dàshí'', "The Black-robed Tazi", ({{lang|zh|黑衣大食}}) ("Tazi" being a borrowing from Persian ''[[wikt:تازی|Tāzī]]'', the word for "Arab").{{refn|group=nb|Wade states "Tazi in Persian sources referred to a people in that land, but was later extended to cover Arab lands. The Persian term was adopted by Tang China (Dàshí :大食) to refer to the Arabs until the 12th century."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|2012|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|Marshall Broomhall writes, "With the rise of the Abbasides we enter upon a somewhat different phase of Muslim history, and approach the period when an important body of Muslim troops entered and settled within the Chinese Empire. While the Abbasids inaugurated that era of literature and science associated with the Court at Bagdad, the hitherto predominant Arab element began to give way to the Turks, who soon became the bodyguard of the Caliphs, ‘until in the end the Caliphs became the helpless tools of their rude protectors.’

Several embassies from the Abbaside Caliphs to the Chinese Court are recorded in the T'ang Annals, the most important of these being those of (A-bo-lo-ba) Abul Abbas, the founder of the new dynasty, that of (A-p'u-cKa-fo) Abu Giafar, the builder of Bagdad and that of (A-lun) Harun al Raschid, best known, perhaps, in modern days through the popular work, Arabian Nights. The Abbasides or 'Black Flags,' as they were commonly called, are known in Chinese history as the Heh-i Ta-shih, 'The Black-robed Arabs.'

Five years after the rise of the Abbasides, at a time when Abu Giafar, the second Caliph, was busy plotting the assassination of his great and able rival Abu Muslim, who is regarded as "the leading figure of the age" and the de facto founder of the house of Abbas so far as military prowess is concerned, a terrible rebellion broke out in China. This was in 755, and the leader was a Turk or Tartar named An Lu-shan. This man, who had gained great favour with the Emperor Hsuan Tsung, and had been placed at the head of a vast army operating against the Turks and Tartars on the north-west frontier, ended in proclaiming his independence and declaring war upon his now aged Imperial patron. The Emperor, driven from his capital, abdicated in favour of his son, Su Tsung (756–763), who at once appealed to the Arabs for help.

The Caliph Abu Giafar, whose army, we are told by Sir William Muir, 'was fitted throughout with improved weapons and armour,' responded to this request, and sent a contingent of some 4000 men, who enabled the Emperor, in 757, to recover his two capitals, Sianfu and Honanfu. These Arab troops, who probably came from some garrison on the frontiers of Turkestan, never returned to their former camp, but remained in China, where they married Chinese wives, and thus became, according to common report, the real nucleus of the naturalised Chinese Mohammedans of to-day.

While this story has the support of the official history of the T'ang dynasty, there is, unfortunately, no authorised statement as to how many troops the Caliph really sent. The statement, however, is also supported by the Chinese Mohammedan inscriptions and literature. Though the settlement of this large body of Arabs in China may be accepted as probably the largest and most definite event recorded concerning the advent of Islam, it is necessary at the same time not to overlook the facts already stated in the previous chapter, which prove that large numbers of foreigners had entered China prior to this date."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Broomhall|1910|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|Frank Brinkley says, "It would seem, however, that trade occupied the attention of the early Mohammedan settlers rather than religious propagandism; that while they observed the tenets and practised the rites of their faith in China, they did not undertake any strenuous campaign against either Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, or the State creed, and that they constituted a floating rather than a fixed element of the population, coming and going between China and the West by the oversea or the overland routes. According to Giles, the true stock of the present Chinese Mohammedans was a small army of four thousand Arabian soldiers, who, being sent by the Khaleef Abu Giafar in 755 to aid in putting down a rebellion, were subsequently permitted to settle in China, where they married native wives.

The numbers of this colony received large accessions in the 12th and 13th centuries during the conquests of Genghis, and ultimately the Mohammedans formed an appreciable element of the population, having their own mosques and schools, and observing the rites of their religion, but winning few converts except among the aboriginal tribes, as the Lolos and the Mantsu. Their failure as propagandists is doubtless due to two causes, first, that, according to the inflexible rule of their creed, the Koran might not be translated into Chinese or any other foreign language; secondly and chiefly, that their denunciations of idolatry were as unpalatable to ancestor-worshipping Chinese as were their interdicts against pork and wine. They were never prevented, however, from practising their faith so long as they obeyed the laws of the land, and the numerous mosques that exist throughout China prove what a large measure of liberty these professors of a strange creed enjoyed. One feature of the mosques is noticeable, however: though distinguished by large arches and by Arabic inscriptions, they are generally constructed and arranged so as to bear some resemblance to Buddhist temples, and they have tablets carrying the customary ascription of reverence to the Emperor of China – facts suggesting that their builders were not entirely free from a sense of the inexpediency of differentiating the evidences of their religion too conspicuously from those of the popular creed. It has been calculated that in the regions north of the Yangtse the followers of Islam aggregate as many as ten millions, and that eighty thousand are to be found in one of the towns of Szchuan. On the other hand, just as it has been shown above that although the Central Government did not in any way interdict or obstruct the tradal operations of foreigners in early times, the local officials sometimes subjected them to extortion and maltreatment of a grievous and even unendurable nature, so it appears that while as a matter of State policy, full tolerance was extended to the Mohammedan creed, its disciples frequently found themselves the victims of such unjust discrimination at the hand of local officialdom that they were driven to seek redress in rebellion. That, however, did not occur until the 19th century. There is no evidence that, prior to the time of the Great Manchu Emperor Chienlung (1736–1796), Mohammedanism presented any deterrent aspect to the Chinese. That renowned ruler, whose conquests carried his banners to the Pamirs and the Himalayas, did indeed conceive a strong dread of the potentialities of Islamic fanaticism reinforced by disaffection on the part of the aboriginal tribes among whom the faith had many adherents. He is said to have entertained at one time the terrible project of eliminating this source of danger in Shensi and Kansuh by killing every Mussulman found there, but whether he really contemplated an act so foreign to the general character of his procedure is doubtful. The broad fact is that the Central Government of China has never persecuted Mohammedans or discriminated against them. They are allowed to present themselves at the examinations for civil or military appointments, and the successful candidates obtain office as readily as their Chinese competitors."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brinkley|1902|pp=149–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|It states in Moule's book, "though the actual date and circumstances of the introduction of Islam into China cannot be traced with certainty further back than the 13th century, yet the existence of settlements of foreign Moslems with their Mosques at Ganfu (Canton) during the T'ang dynasty (618–907) is certain, and later they spread to Ch'uan-chou and to Kan-p'u, Hangchow, and perhaps to Ningpo and Shanghai. These were not preaching or proselytising inroads, but commercial enterprises, and in the latter half of the 8th century there were Moslem troops in Shensi, 3,000 men, under Abu Giafar, coming to support the dethroned Emperor in 756. In the 13th century the influence of individual Muslims was immense, especially that of the Seyyid Edjell Shams ed-Din Omar, who served the Mongol Khans till his death in Yunnan in 1279. His family still exists in Yunnan, and has taken a prominent part in Moslem affairs in China.

The present Muslim element in China is most numerous in Yunnan and Kansu; and the most learned Muslims reside chiefly in Ssuch'uan, the majority of their books being printed in the capital city, Ch'eng-tu. Kansu is perhaps the most dominantly Mohammedan province in China, and here many different sects are found, and mosques with minarets used by the orthodox muezzin calling to prayer, and in one place veiled women are met with. These, however, are not Turks or Saracens, but for the most part pure Chinese. The total Moslem population is probably under 4,000,000, though other statistical estimates, always uncertain in China, vary from thirty to ten millions; but the figures given here are the most reliable at present obtainable, and when it is remembered that Islam in China has not been to any great extent a preaching or propagandist power by force or the sword, it is difficult to understand the survival and existence of such a large number as that, small, indeed, compared with former estimates, but surely a very large and vigorous element."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moule|1914|p=317}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|In Giles book, he writes "Mahomedans: IEJ Iej.

The first mosque was built at Canton, where, after several restorations, it still exists. Another mosque was erected in 742, but many of these M. came to China simply as traders, and by and by went back to their own country. The true stock of the present Chinese Mahomedans was a small army of 4,000 Arabian soldiers sent by the Khaleef Abu Giafar in 755 to aid in putting down a rebellion. These soldiers had permission to settle in China, where they married native wives; and three centuries later, with the conquests of Genghis Khan, largo numbers of Arabs penetrated into the Empire and swelled the Mahomedan community."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giles|1886|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Al-Rashid sent embassies to the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] and established good relations with them.&lt;ref name="Dennis Bloodworth, Ching Ping Bloodworth 2004 214"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Giles also writes, "In 789 the Khalifa Harun al Raschid dispatched a mission to China, and there had been one or two less important missions in the seventh and eighth centuries; but from 879, the date of the Canton massacre, for more than three centuries to follow, we hear nothing of the Mahometans and their religion. They were not mentioned in the edict of 845, which proved such a blow to Buddhism and Nestorian Christianity perhaps because they were less obtrusive in the propagation of their religion, a policy aided by the absence of anything like a commercial spirit in religious matters."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Giles|1915|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{refn|group=nb|Giles also writes, in the same book, "The first mosque was built at Canton, where, after several restorations, it may still be seen.

There must at that time have been a considerable number of Mahometans in Canton, thought not so many as might be supposed if reliance could be placed on the figures given in reference to a massacre which took place in 879. The fact is that most of these Mahometans went to China simply as traders; they did not intend to settle permanently in the country, and when business permitted, they returned to their old haunts. About two thousand Mussulman families are still to be found at Canton, and a similar number at Foochow; descendants, perhaps, of the old sea-borne contingents which began to arrive in the seventh and eighth centuries.

===Abbasid Golden Age (775–861)===

The Abbasid leadership had to work hard in the last half of the 8th century (750–800), under several competent caliphs and their viziers to overcome the political challenges created by the far flung nature of the empire, and the limited communication across it and usher in the administrative changes needed to keep order.&lt;ref name = "Brauer"&gt;{{harvnb|Brauer|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also during this early period of the dynasty, in particular during the governance of  [[al-Mansur]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], and [[al-Ma'mun]], that the reputation and power of the dynasty was created.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}

Al-Mahdi [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|restarted the fighting]] with the Byzantines and his sons continued the conflict until [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]] pushed for peace.{{sfn|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=233}} After several years of peace, [[Nikephoros I]] broke the treaty, then fended off multiple incursions during the first decade of the 9th century. These attacks pushed into the [[Taurus Mountains]] culminating with a victory at the [[Battle of Krasos]] and the [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (806)|massive invasion of 806]], led by Rashid himself.&lt;ref name=DD1&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rashid's navy also proved successful as he took [[Cyprus]]. Eventually, the momentum turned and much of the land gained was lost. Rashid decided to focus on the rebellion of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]] in Khorasan and died while there.&lt;ref name="DD1"/&gt; While the [[Byzantine Empire]] was fighting Abbasid rule in Syria and [[Anatolia]], military operations during this period were minimal, as the caliphate focused on internal matters, its governors exerting greater autonomy and using their increasing power to make their positions hereditary.&lt;ref name = "AHGC"/&gt;

At the same time, the Abbasids faced challenges closer to home. Harun al-Rashid turned on the [[Barmakids]], a Persian family that had grown significantly in power within the administration of the state and killed most of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meisami|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, several factions began either to leave the empire for other lands or to take control of distant parts of the empire away from the Abbasids. The reign of al-Rashid and his sons were considered to be the apex of the Abbasids.&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{harvnb|Magnusson|Goring|1990|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbasid Dinar - Al Amin - 195 AH (811 AD).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Gold dinar]] minted during the reign of [[al-Amin]] (809–813)]]
After Rashid's death, the empire was split by a [[Fourth Fitna|civil war]] between the caliph [[al-Amin]] and his brother [[al-Ma'mun]] who had the support of Khorasan. This war ended with a [[Siege of Baghdad (812–813)|two-year siege]] of Baghdad and the eventual death of al-Amin in 813.&lt;ref name=DD1/&gt; Al-Ma'mun ruled for 20 years of relative calm interspersed with a rebellion supported by the Byzantines in [[Iranian Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]] by the [[Khurramites]]. Al-Ma'mun was also responsible for the creation of an autonomous Khorasan, and the continued repulsing of Byzantine forays.&lt;ref name=DD1/&gt;

[[Al-Mu'tasim]] gained power in 833 and his rule marked the end of the strong caliphs. He strengthened his personal army with Turkish mercenaries and promptly restarted the war with the Byzantines. His military excursions were generally successful culminating with a resounding victory in the [[Sack of Amorium]]. His attempt at seizing [[Constantinople]] failed when his fleet was destroyed by a storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|dupuy|1986|pp=265–266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantines restarted the fighting by [[Sack of Damietta (853)|sacking Damietta]] in Egypt.

==Fracture to autonomous dynasties (861–945)==
[[File:Abbasid Caliphate 891-892.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map of the fragmented Abbasid empire, with areas still under direct control of the Abbasid central government (dark green) and under autonomous rulers (light green) adhering to nominal Abbasid suzerainty, {{circa|892}}]]

Even by 820, the [[Samanid]]s had begun the process of exercising independent authority in [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan]], as had the [[Twelver]]-Shia [[Hamdanid]]s in Northern Syria, and the succeeding [[Tahirid]] and [[Saffarid]] dynasties of Iran. The Saffarids, from Khorasan, nearly seized Baghdad in 876, and the [[Tulunid]]s took control of most of Syria. The trend of weakening of the central power and strengthening of the minor caliphates on the periphery continued.&lt;ref name=mag /&gt;

An exception was the 10-year period of [[Al-Mu'tadid]]'s rule. He brought parts of Egypt, Syria, and Khorasan back into the Abbasid's control. Especially after the "[[Anarchy at Samarra]]", the Abbasid central government was weakened and centrifugal tendencies became more prominent in the Caliphate's provinces. By the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control of Iraq to various [[amir]]s, and the caliph [[al-Radi]] was forced to acknowledge their power by creating the position of "Prince of Princes" (''[[amir al-umara]]'').&lt;ref name=mag /&gt;

[[Al-Mustakfi]] had a short reign from 944–946, and it was during this period that the Persian faction known as the [[Buyids]] from [[Daylam]] swept into power and assumed control over the bureaucracy in Baghdad. According to the history of [[Miskawayh]], they began distributing [[iqta]]s ([[fief]]s in the form of tax farms) to their supporters. This period of localized secular control was to last nearly 100 years.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} The loss of Abbasid power to the Buyids would shift as the Seljuks would take over from the Persians.&lt;ref name=mag /&gt;

At the end of the eighth century the Abbasids found they could no longer keep a huge polity larger than that of Rome together from Baghdad. In 793 the [[Zaydi]]-Shia dynasty of [[Idrisids]] set up a state from Fez in Morocco, while a family of governors under the Abbasids became increasingly independent until they founded the Aghlabid Emirate from the 830s. Al-Mu'tasim started the downward slide by utilizing non-Muslim mercenaries in his personal army. Also during this period officers started assassinating superiors with whom they disagreed, in particular the caliphs.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}}

By the 870s Egypt became autonomous under [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]. In the East as well, governors decreased their ties to the center. The [[Saffarids]] of Herat and the [[Samanids]] of Bukhara had broken away from the 870s, cultivating a much more [[Persianate culture]] and statecraft. By this time only the central lands of Mesopotamia were under direct Abbasid control, with Palestine and the Hijaz often managed by the Tulunids. Byzantium, for its part, had begun to push Arab Muslims farther east in Anatolia.

By the 920s, the situation had changed further, as North Africa was lost to the Abbasids. An Shia sect only recognizing the first five Imams and tracing its roots to Muhammad's daughter Fatima took control of Idrisid and then Aghlabid domains.&lt;ref name=mag /&gt; Called the [[Fatimid dynasty]], they had advanced to Egypt in 969, establishing their capital near Fustat in Cairo, which they built as a bastion of Shia learning and politics. By 1000 they had become the chief political and ideological challenge to Sunni Islam in the form of the Abbasids. By this time the latter state had fragmented into several governorships that, while recognizing caliphal authority from Baghdad, did mostly as they wanted, fighting with each other. The Caliph himself was under 'protection' of the Buyid Emirs who possessed all of Iraq and western Iran, and were quietly Shia in their sympathies.

Outside Iraq, all the autonomous provinces slowly took on the characteristic of de facto states with hereditary rulers, armies, and revenues and operated under only nominal caliph suzerainty, which may not necessarily be reflected by any contribution to the treasury, such as the [[Soomro]] [[Emir]]s that had gained control of [[Sindh]] and ruled the entire province from their capital of [[Mansura, Sindh|Mansura]].&lt;ref name="Brauer" /&gt; [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] took the title of sultan, as opposed to the [[Emir|"amir"]] that had been in more common usage, signifying the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]]'s independence from caliphal authority, despite Mahmud's ostentatious displays of Sunni orthodoxy and ritual submission to the caliph. In the 11th century, the loss of respect for the caliphs continued, as some Islamic rulers no longer mentioned the caliph's name in the Friday [[khutba]], or struck it off their coinage.&lt;ref name="Brauer" /&gt;

The [[Isma'ili]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty of Cairo contested the Abbasids for even the titular authority of the Islamic [[ummah]]. They commanded some support in the Shia sections of Baghdad (such as [[Karkh]]), although Baghdad was the city most closely connected to the caliphate, even in the Buyid and Seljuq eras. The Fatimids' green banners contrasted with Abbasids' black, and the challenge of the Fatimids only ended with their downfall in the 12th century.

===Buyid and Seljuq control (945–1118)===
Despite the power of the [[Buyids|Buyid]] amirs, the Abbasids retained a highly ritualized court in Baghdad, as described by the Buyid bureaucrat [[Hilal al-Sabi']], and they retained a certain influence over Baghdad as well as religious life. As Buyid power waned after the death of [[Baha' al-Daula]], the caliphate was able to regain some measure of strength. The caliph [[al-Qadir]], for example, led the ideological struggle against the Shia with writings such as the ''[[Baghdad Manifesto]]''. The caliphs kept order in Baghdad itself, attempting to prevent the outbreak of [[fitna (word)|fitnas]] in the capital, often contending with the ''[[ayyarun]]'

With the Buyid dynasty on the wane, a vacuum was created that was eventually filled by the dynasty of [[Oghuz Turks]] known as the [[Seljuqs]]. By 1055, the Seljuqs had wrested control from the Buyids and Abbasids, and took any remaining temporal power.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} When the amir and former slave [[Basasiri]] took up the Shia [[Fatimid]] banner in Baghdad in, the caliph [[al-Qa'im (caliph)|al-Qa'im]] was unable to defeat him without outside help. [[Toghril Beg]], the Seljuq sultan, restored Baghdad to Sunni rule and took Iraq for his dynasty.

Once again, the Abbasids were forced to deal with a military power that they could not match, though the Abbasid caliph remained the titular head of the Islamic community. The succeeding sultans [[Alp Arslan]] and [[Malikshah]], as well as their vizier [[Nizam al-Mulk]], took up residence in Persia, but held power over the Abbasids in Baghdad. When the dynasty began to weaken in the 12th century, the Abbasids gained greater independence once again.

===Revival of military strength (1118–1258)===
[[File:Abbasids Baghdad Iraq 1244.JPG|thumb|upright|220px|Coin of the Abbasids, Baghdad, 1244]]
While the Caliph [[al-Mustarshid]] was the first caliph to build an army capable of meeting a Seljuk army in battle, he was nonetheless defeated in 1135 and assassinated. The Caliph [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|al-Muqtafi]] was the first Abbasid Caliph to regain the full military independence of the Caliphate, with the help of his vizier [[Awn ad-Din ibn Hubayra|Ibn Hubayra]]. After nearly 250 years of subjection to foreign dynasties, he successfully defended Baghdad against the Seljuqs in the [[siege of Baghdad (1157)]], thus securing Iraq for the Abbasids. The reign of [[al-Nasir]] (d. 1225) brought the caliphate back into power throughout Iraq, based in large part on the [[Sufi]] [[futuwwa]] organizations that the caliph headed.&lt;ref name=mag/&gt; [[Al-Mustansir (caliph)|Al-Mustansir]] built the [[Mustansiriya School]], in an attempt to eclipse the Seljuq-era [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad|Nizamiyya]] built by [[Nizam al-Mulk]].

===Mongol invasion (1206–1258)===
[[File:DiezAlbumsFallOfBaghdad a.jpg|thumb|upright|220px|[[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Siege of Baghdad]] by the Mongols led by [[Hulagu Khan]] in 1258]]
In 1206, [[Genghis Khan]] established a powerful dynasty among the [[Mongol]]s of [[central Asia]]. During the 13th century, this [[Mongol Empire]] conquered most of the Eurasian land mass, including both China in the east and much of the old Islamic caliphate (as well as [[Kievan Rus']]) in the west. [[Hulagu Khan]]'s [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|destruction of Baghdad]] in 1258 is traditionally seen as the approximate end of the Golden Age.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Yue|2008|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mongols feared that a supernatural disaster would strike if the blood of [[Al-Musta'sim]], a direct descendant of Muhammad's  uncle [[Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib]],&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;{{harvnb|Glassé|Smith|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the last reigning Abbasid caliph in Baghdad, was spilled. The Shia of [[Persia]] stated that no such calamity had happened after the death of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] in the [[Battle of Kerbala]]; nevertheless, as a precaution and in accordance with a Mongol taboo which forbade spilling royal blood, Hulagu had Al-Musta'sim wrapped in a carpet and trampled to death by horses on 20 February 1258. The Caliph's immediate family was also executed, with the lone exceptions of his youngest son who was sent to Mongolia, and a daughter who became a slave in the [[harem]] of Hulagu.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frazier|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbasid Caliphate of Cairo (1261–1517)===
{{Main article |Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)}}
In the 9th century, the Abbasids created an army loyal only to their caliphate, composed of non-Arab origin people, known as [[Mamluks]].&lt;ref name="István Vásáry 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Vásáry|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Isichei 1997 192"&gt;{{harvnb|Isichei|1997|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="T.

The Mamluk army, though often viewed negatively, both helped and hurt the caliphate. Early on, it provided the government with a stable force to address domestic and foreign problems. However, creation of this foreign army and al-Mu'tasim's transfer of the capital from Baghdad to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]] created a division between the caliphate and the peoples they claimed to rule. In addition, the power of the Mamluks steadily grew until [[al-Radi]] (934–41) was constrained to hand over most of the royal functions to [[Muhammad ibn Ra'iq]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The Mamluks eventually came to power in Egypt. In 1261, following the devastation of Baghdad by the Mongols, the Mamluk rulers of Egypt re-established the Abbasid caliphate in [[Cairo]]. The first Abbasid caliph of Cairo was [[Al-Mustansir II of Cairo|Al-Mustansir]]. The Abbasid caliphs in Egypt continued to maintain the presence of authority, but it was confined to religious matters.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Abbasid caliphate of Cairo lasted until the time of [[Al-Mutawakkil III]], who was taken away as a prisoner by [[Selim I]] to Constantinople where he had a ceremonial role. He died in 1543, following his return to Cairo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

The Abbasid historical period lasting to the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Mongol conquest of Baghdad]] in 1258 CE is considered the Islamic Golden Age.&lt;ref name="Tahir Abbas"&gt;{{harvnb|Abbas|2011|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Golden Age was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid [[Caliphate]] and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to Baghdad.&lt;ref name="Vartan"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregorian|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as "the ink of a scholar is more holy than the blood of a martyr" stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the Muslim world became an intellectual center for science, philosophy, medicine and education as &lt;ref name="Vartan" /&gt; the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the [[House of Wisdom]] in Baghdad; where both Muslim and non-Muslim scholars sought to translate and gather all the world's knowledge into [[Arabic language|Arabic]].&lt;ref name="Vartan" /&gt; Many classic works of antiquity that would otherwise have been lost were translated into Arabic and Persian and later in turn translated into Turkish, Hebrew and Latin.&lt;ref name="Vartan" /&gt; During this period the Muslim world was a cauldron of cultures which collected, synthesized and significantly advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], Chinese, [[History of India|Indian]], [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], North African, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Byzantine]] civilizations.&lt;ref name="Vartan" /&gt; "In virtually every field of endeavor—in astronomy, alchemy, mathematics, medicine, optics and so forth—the Caliphate's scientists were in the forefront of scientific advance."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huff|2003|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Mustansiriya University]] in [[Baghdad]]]]The reigns of [[Harun al-Rashid]] (786–809) and his successors fostered an age of great intellectual achievement. In large part, this was the result of the schismatic forces that had undermined the Umayyad regime, which relied on the assertion of the superiority of [[Arab culture]] as part of its claim to legitimacy, and the Abbasids' welcoming of support from non-Arab Muslims. It is well established that the Abbasid caliphs modeled their administration on that of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibb|1982|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harun al-Rashid's son, [[Al-Ma'mun]] (whose mother was [[Persian people|Persian]]), is even quoted as saying:

A number of medieval thinkers and scientists living under Islamic rule played a role in transmitting [[Islamic science]] to the Christian West. In addition, the period saw the recovery of much of the [[Alexandria]]n mathematical, geometric and astronomical knowledge, such as that of [[Euclid]] and Claudius [[Ptolemy]]. These recovered mathematical methods were later enhanced and developed by other Islamic scholars, notably by [[Persian people|Persian]] scientists [[Al-Biruni]] and [[Abu Nasr Mansur]].

[[Christians]] (particularly [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the [[Ummayads]] and the Abbasids by translating works of [[Greek philosophers]] to [[Syriac Language|Syriac]] and afterwards to [[Arabic Language|Arabic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brague|2009|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nestorians played a prominent role in the formation of Arab culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010a|p=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Jundishapur]] school being prominent in the late [[Sassanid]], [[Umayyad]] and early Abbasid periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Söylemez|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, eight generations of the Nestorian [[Bukhtishu]] family served as private doctors to caliphs and sultans between the eighth and eleventh centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonner|Ener|Singer|2003|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruano|Burgos|1992|p=527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is thus considered to be the father of algebra by some,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eglash|1999|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Greek mathematician [[Diophantus]] has also been given this title.

[[File:Hazan.png|thumb|220px|[[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]], "the father of [[Optics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verma|1969}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Arab]] scientist [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) developed an early [[scientific method]] in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' (1021). The most important development of the scientific method was the use of experiments to distinguish between competing scientific theories set within a generally [[empiricism|empirical]] orientation, which began among Muslim scientists. Ibn al-Haytham's [[empirical]] proof of the intromission theory of light (that is, that light rays entered the eyes rather than being [[emission theory (vision)|emitted by them]]) was particularly important. Alhazen was significant in the [[history of scientific method]], particularly in his approach to experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been referred to as the "world’s first true scientist".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Khalili|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Medicine in medieval Islam]] was an area of science that advanced particularly during the Abbasids' reign. During the 9th century, Baghdad contained over 800 doctors, and great discoveries in the understanding of anatomy and diseases were made. The clinical distinction between [[measles]] and [[smallpox]] was described during this time. Famous Persian scientist [[Ibn Sina]] (known to the West as [[Avicenna]]) produced treatises and works that summarized the vast amount of knowledge that scientists had accumulated, and was very influential through his encyclopedias, ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' and ''[[The Book of Healing]]''. The work of him and many others directly influenced the research of European scientists during the [[Renaissance]].

[[Astronomy in medieval Islam]] was advanced by [[Al-Battani]], who improved the precision of the measurement of the [[precession]] of the Earth's axis. The corrections made to the [[geocentric model]] by al-Battani,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Averroes]],{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], [[Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi]] and [[Ibn al-Shatir]] were later incorporated into the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican heliocentric]] model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rabin|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astrolabe]], though originally developed by the Greeks, was developed further by Islamic astronomers and engineers, and subsequently brought to medieval Europe.

[[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Muslim alchemists]] influenced medieval European alchemists, particularly the writings attributed to [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (Geber). A number of [[chemical process]]es such as [[distillation]] techniques were developed in the Muslim world and then spread to Europe.

[[File:More tales from the Arabian nights-14566176968.jpg|right|thumb|Illustration from ''More tales from the Arabian nights'' (1915)]]

The best known fiction from the Islamic world is ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'', a collection of fantastical folk tales, legends and parables compiled primarily during the Abbassid era. The collection is recorded as having originated from an Arabic translation of a Sassanian era Persian prototype, with likely origins in Indian literary traditions. Stories from [[Arabic literature|Arabic]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], [[Mesopotamia]]n, and [[Egyptian literature|Egyptian]] folklore and literature were later incorporated. The epic is believed to have taken shape in the 10th century and reached its final form by the 14th century; the number and type of tales have varied from one manuscript to another.&lt;ref name="arabianNights"&gt;{{Harvnb | Grant | Clute | 1999 | p = 51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All Arabian [[fantasy]] tales were often called "Arabian Nights" when translated into English, regardless of whether they appeared in ''The Book of One Thousand and One Nights''.&lt;ref name="arabianNights"/&gt; This epic has been influential in the West since it was translated in the 18th century, first by [[Antoine Galland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|de Camp|1976|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many imitations were written, especially in France.&lt;ref name="arabianNights2"&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|Clute|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various characters from this epic have themselves become cultural icons in Western culture, such as [[Aladdin]], [[Sinbad]] and [[Ali Baba]].

A famous example of Islamic poetry on [[romance (love)|romance]] was ''[[Layla and Majnun]]'', an originally [[Arabic]] story which was further developed by [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] and other poets in [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clinton|2000|pp=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Tragedy|tragic]] story of undying love much like the later ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Arabic poetry reached its greatest height in the Abbasid era, especially before the loss of central authority and the rise of the Persianate dynasties. Writers like [[Abu Tammam]] and [[Abu Nuwas]] were closely connected to the caliphal court in Baghdad during the early 9th century, while others such as [[al-Mutanabbi]] received their patronage from regional courts.

===Philosophy===
{{Main article |Islamic philosophy|Early Islamic philosophy}}
{{Further information |Logic in Islamic philosophy|Kalam|Avicennism|Averroism|Illuminationist philosophy|Transcendent Theosophy}}
One of the common definitions for "Islamic philosophy" is "the style of philosophy produced within the framework of Islamic culture."&lt;ref name="RoutledgeEoP"&gt;{{harvnb|Leaman|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic philosophy, in this definition is neither necessarily concerned with religious issues, nor is exclusively produced by Muslims.&lt;ref name="RoutledgeEoP" /&gt; Their works on [[Aristotle]] was a key step in the transmission of learning from ancient Greeks to the Islamic world and the West. They often corrected the philosopher, encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of [[ijtihad]]. They also wrote influential original philosophical works, and their thinking was incorporated into [[Christian philosophy]] during the Middle Ages, notably by [[Thomas Aquinas]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Three speculative thinkers, [[al-Kindi]], [[al-Farabi]], and [[Avicenna]], combined [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]] with other ideas introduced through Islam, and [[Avicennism]] was later established as a result. Other influential Abbasid philosophers include [[al-Jahiz]], and [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhacen).

===Architecture===
[[File:Baghdad-Zumurrud-Khaton.jpg|thumb|[[Zumurrud Khatun Mosque|Zumurrud Khatun Tomb]] (1200 CE), in cemetery at [[Baghdad]]]]
As the power shifted from the Umayyads to the Abbasids, the architecture styles changed also. The Christian styles evolved into a style based more on the [[Sasanian Empire]] utilizing mud bricks and baked bricks with carved stucco.&lt;ref name=wil&gt;{{harvnb|Wilber|1969|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major development was the creation or vast enlargement of cities as they were turned into the capital of the empire. First, starting with the creation of Baghdad, starting in 762, which was planned as a walled city with a mosque and palace in the center. The walls were to have four gates to exit the city. Al-Mansur, who was responsible for the creation of Baghdad, also planned the city of [[Raqqa]], along the [[Euphrates]]. Finally, in 836, al-Mu'tasim moved the capital to a new site that he created along the [[Tigris]], called [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. This city saw 60 years of work, with race-courses and game preserves to add to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=wil/&gt; Due to the dry remote nature of the environment, some of the palaces built in this era were isolated havens. [[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] is a fine example of this type of building which has stables, living quarters, and a mosque, all surrounding inner courtyards.&lt;ref name=wil/&gt; Other mosques of this era, such as the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]], in [[Cairo]], and the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in [[Tunisia]] while ultimately built during the Umayyad dynasty, it was substantially renovated in the 9th century. This renovation was so extensive as to ostensibly be a rebuild, was in the furthest reaches of the Muslim world, in an area that the [[Aghlabids]] controlled; however the styles utilized were mainly of the Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilmer|1969|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesopotamia only has one surviving [[mausoleum]] from this era, in Samarra. This octagonal dome is the final resting place of [[al-Muntasir]].&lt;ref name=wil2&gt;{{harvnb|Wilber|1969|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other architectural innovations and styles were few, such as the [[four-centred arch|four-centered arch]], and a dome erected on [[squinch]]es. Unfortunately, much was lost due to the ephemeral nature of the stucco and luster tiles.&lt;ref name=wil2/&gt;

===Glass and crystal===
The Near East has, since Roman times, been recognized as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups utilized for domestic use. Decorations on these domestic items include molded flutes, honeycomb patterns, and inscriptions.&lt;ref name=dim&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other styles seen that may not have come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or [[Kufic]] inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, have been found in [[Nishapur]], along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===
[[File:British Museum Harem wall painting fragments 2.jpg|thumb|9th-century [[harem]] wall painting fragments found in [[Samarra]]]]
Early Abbasid painting has not survived in great quantities, and sometimes harder to differentiate; however Samarra is a good example as it was built by the Abbasids and abandoned 56 years later. The walls of the principal rooms of the palace that has been excavated show wall paintings and lively carved stucco [[Dado (architecture)|dadoes]]. The style is obviously adopted with little variation from Sassanian art, as not only the styles is similar with harems, animals, and dancing people, all enclosed in scrollwork, but also the garments are Persian.&lt;ref name=dim2&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969a|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nishapur]] had its own school of painting. Excavations at Nishapur show artwork both monochrome and polychrome from the 8th and 9th centuries. One famous piece of art consists of hunting nobles with falcons and on horseback, in full regalia; the clothing identifies him as [[Tahirid]], which was again, a sub-dynasty of the Abbasids. Other styles are of vegetation, and fruit in nice colors on a four foot high dedo.&lt;ref name=dim2/&gt;

===Pottery===
[[File:Bowl with Kufic Inscription.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bowl with [[Kufic]] Inscription, 9th century, [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Whereas painting and architecture were not areas of strength for the Abbasid dynasty, pottery was a different story. The Islamic culture as a whole and the Abbasid's, in particular, were at the forefront of new ideas and techniques. Some examples of their work were pieces engraved with decorations and then colored with yellow-brown, green, and purple glazes. Designs were diverse with geometric patterns, Kufic lettering, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] scrollwork, along with rosettes, animals, birds, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbasid pottery from the 8th and 9th centuries have been found throughout the region, as far as Cairo. These were generally made with a yellow clay and fired multiple times with separate glazes to produce metallic luster in shades of gold, brown, or red. By the 9th century, the potters had mastered their techniques and their decorative designs could be divided into two styles. The Persian style would show animals, birds, humans, along with Kufic lettering in gold. Pieces excavated from [[Samarra]] exceed in vibrancy and beauty any from later periods. These predominantly being made for the Caliphs use. Tiles were also made utilizing this same technique to create both monochromic and polychromic luster tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969b|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textiles===
Egypt being a center of the textile industry was part of the Abbasid cultural advancement. [[Copt]]s were employed in the textile industry and produced linens and silks. [[Tinnis]] was famous for its factories and had over 5,000 looms. Kasab, a fine linen for turbans and badana for garments of the upper class to name a couple. In a town named [[Tuna (Egypt)|Tuna]] near Tinnis, was made the [[kiswah]] for the [[kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. Fine silk was also made in [[Dabik]] and [[Damietta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest is the stamped and inscribed fabrics. Not only did they utilize inks but also liquid gold. Some of the finer pieces were colored in such a manner as to require six separate stamps to achieve the proper design and color. This technology spread to Europe eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimand|1969c|pp=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
{{Main article |Inventions in medieval Islam|Arab Agricultural Revolution|Timeline of Islamic science and technology}}
[[File:Wasseruhr Harun al Raschid.jpg|thumb|Illustration showing a [[water clock]] given to [[Charlemagne]] by [[Harun al-Rashid]]]]
In technology, the Abbasids adopted [[papermaking]] from China.&lt;ref name= Lucas/&gt; The use of paper spread from China into the caliphate in the 8th century CE, arriving in [[al-Andalus]] (Islamic Spain) and then the rest of Europe in the 10th century. It was easier to manufacture than [[parchment]], less likely to crack than [[papyrus]], and could absorb ink, making it ideal for making records and making copies of the Koran. "Islamic paper makers devised assembly-line methods of hand-copying manuscripts to turn out editions far larger than any available in Europe for centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cotter|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was from the Abbasids that the rest of the world learned to make paper from linen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunn|2003|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The knowledge of [[gunpowder]] was also transmitted from China via the caliphate, where the formulas for pure [[potassium nitrate]] and an [[explosive]] gunpowder effect were first developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances were made in [[irrigation]] and farming, using new technology such as the [[windmill]]. Crops such as [[almond]]s and [[citrus]] fruit were brought to Europe through [[al-Andalus]], and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted by the Europeans. Apart from the [[Nile]], [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]], navigable rivers were uncommon, so transport by sea was very important. Navigational sciences were highly developed, making use of a rudimentary [[sextant]] (known as a kamal). When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast. Abbasid sailors were also responsible for reintroducing large three masted merchant vessels to the [[Mediterranean]]. The name [[caravel]] may derive from an earlier Arab ship known as the ''qārib''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schwarz|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century. [[Ormus|Hormuz]] was an important center for this trade. There was also a dense network of trade routes in the [[Mediterranean]], along which Muslim countries traded with each other and with European powers such as [[Venice]], [[Genoa]] and [[Catalonia]]. The [[Silk Road]] crossing Central Asia passed through Abbasid caliphate between China and Europe.

[[File:Bruges Belgium Windmill-Bonne-Chiere-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Windmills]] were among Abbasid inventions in technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFhGW3MxgPMC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=abbasid+windmill&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yiXW-ylj9P&amp;sig=CaGANbKLrDixUhkv86wphrUzhZo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=abbasid%20windmill&amp;f=false|title=Syria|last=Phillips|first=Douglas A.|last2=Gritzner|first2=Charles F.|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438132389|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;|left]]

Engineers in the Abbasid caliphate made a number of innovative industrial uses of [[hydropower]], and early industrial uses of [[tidal power]], [[wind power]], and petroleum (notably by distillation into [[kerosene]]). The industrial uses of [[watermill]]s in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-[[Water wheel|wheeled]] and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. By the time of the Crusades, every province throughout the Islamic world had mills in operation, from [[al-Andalus]] and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. These mills performed a variety of agricultural and industrial tasks.&lt;ref name=Lucas&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbasid engineers also developed machines (such as pumps) incorporating [[crankshaft]]s, employed [[gear]]s in mills and water-raising machines, and used dams to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.&lt;ref name=Hassan&gt;{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such advances made it possible for many industrial tasks that were previously driven by [[manual labour]] in [[ancient times]] to be [[Mechanization|mechanized]] and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. It has been argued that the industrial use of waterpower had spread from Islamic to Christian Spain, where fulling mills, paper mills, and forge mills were recorded for the first time in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of industries were generated during the [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]], including early industries for textiles, sugar, rope-making, matting, silk, and paper. [[Latin translations of the 12th century]] passed on knowledge of chemistry and instrument making in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|al-Hassan|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The agricultural and [[handicraft]] industries also experienced high levels of growth during this period.&lt;ref name = Labib&gt;{{harvnb|Labib|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of women===
In contrast to the earlier era, women in Abbasid society were absent from all arenas of the community's central affairs.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|pp=112–15}} While their Muslim forbearers led men into battle, started rebellions, and played an active role in community life, as demonstrated in the [[Hadith]] literature, Abbasid women were ideally kept in seclusion. Conquests had brought enormous wealth and large numbers of slaves to the Muslim elite. The majority of the slaves were women and children,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Morony, Michael G. Iraq after the Muslim conquest. Gorgias Press LLC, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom had been dependents or harem-members of the defeated [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanian]] upper classes.&lt;ref name="Abbott, Nabia 1946"&gt;Abbott, Nabia. Two queens of Baghdad: mother and wife of Hārūn al Rashīd. University of Chicago Press, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the conquests an elite man could potentially own a thousand slaves, and ordinary soldiers could have ten people serving them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Nabia Abbott]], preeminent historian of elite women of the Abbasid Caliphate, describes the lives of harem women as follows.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The choicest women were imprisoned behind heavy curtains and locked doors, the strings and keys of which were entrusted into the hands of that pitiable creature – the [[eunuch]]. As the size of the harem grew, men indulged to satiety. Satiety within the individual harem meant boredom for the one man and neglect for the many women. Under these conditions ... satisfaction by perverse and unnatural means crept into society, particularly in its upper classes.&lt;ref name="Abbott, Nabia 1946"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The marketing of human beings, particularly women, as objects for sexual use meant that elite men owned the vast majority of women they interacted with, and related to them as would masters to slaves.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=85}} Being a slave meant relative lack of autonomy during this time period, and belonging to a harem caused a wife and her children to have little insurance of stability and continued support due to the volatile politics of harem life.

Elite men expressed in literature the horror they felt for the humiliation and degradation of their daughters and female relatives. For example, the verses addressed to Hasan ibn al-Firat on the death of his daughter read:
:: To Abu Hassan I offer condolences.
:: At times of disaster and catastrophe
:: God multiplies rewards for the patient.
:: To be patient in misery
:: Is equivalent to giving thanks for a gift.
:: Among the blessings of God undoubtedly
:: Is the preservation of sons
:: And the death of daughters.{{sfn|Ahmed|1992|p=87}}

Even so, courtesans and princesses produced prestigious and important poetry. Enough survives to give us access to women's historical experiences, and reveals some vivacious and powerful figures, such as the Sufi mystic [[Rabia Basri|Raabi'a al-Adwiyya]] (714–801 CE), the princess and poet [['Ulayya bint al-Mahdi]] (777–825 CE), and the singing-girls [[Shāriyah]] ({{circa|815}}–70 CE), [[Fadl Ashsha'ira]] (d. 871 CE) and [[Arib al-Ma'muniyya]] (797–890 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|format=PDF |last=Qutbuddin |first=Tahera |editor=Josef W.

===Arabization===
While the Abbasids originally gained power by exploiting the social inequalities against non-Arabs in the Umayyad Empire, during Abbasid rule the empire rapidly Arabized, particularly in the [[Fertile Crescent]] region (namely [[Mesopotamia]] and [[the Levant]]) as had begun under Umayyad rule. As knowledge was shared in the Arabic language throughout the empire, many people from different nationalities and religions began to speak Arabic in their everyday lives. Resources from other languages began to be translated into Arabic, and a unique Islamic identity began to form that fused previous cultures with Arab culture, creating a level of civilization and knowledge that was considered a marvel in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ochsenwald|Fisher|2004|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
In Baghdad there were many Abbasid military leaders who were or said they were of [[Arab]] descent. However, it is clear that most of the ranks were of [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] origin, the vast majority being from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxania]], not from western Iran or Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baghdad-iranian-connection-1-pr-Mongol |title=BAGHDAD i.

the standing army of the Muslims in Khurasan was overwhelmingly Arab, The unit organization of the Abbasids was designed with the goal of ethnic and racial equality among supporters.

==Decline of the empire==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
Abbasids found themselves at odds with the [[Shia]] Muslims, most of whom had supported their war against the Umayyads, since the Abbasids and the Shias claimed legitimacy by their familial connection to Prophet Muhammad; once in power, the Abbasids had disavowed any support for Shia beliefs in favor of [[Sunni]] Islam. Shortly thereafter, Berber [[Kharijite]]s set up an independent state in North Africa in 801. Within 50 years the [[Idrisid]]s in the [[Maghreb]] and [[Aghlabid]]s of [[Ifriqiya]] and a little later the [[Tulunid]]s and [[Ikshidid]]s of [[History of Muslim Egypt|Misr]] were effectively independent in Africa. The Abbasid authority began to deteriorate during the reign of [[al-Radi]] when their Turkic Army generals, who already had de facto independence, stopped paying the Caliphate. Even provinces close to Baghdad began to seek local dynastic rule. Also, the Abbasids found themselves to often be at conflict with the Umayyads in Spain. The Abbasid financial position weakened as well, with tax revenues from the [[Sawād]] decreasing in the 9th and 10th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/12137429/_State_Land_Tax_and_Agriculture_in_Iraq_from_the_Arab_Conquest_to_the_Crisis_of_the_Abbasid_Caliphate_Seventh-Tenth_Centuries_in_Studia_Islamica_3_2012_35-80|title=State, Land Tax and Agriculture in Iraq from the Arab Conquest to the Crisis of the Abbasid Caliphate (Seventh-Tenth Centuries)|first=Campopiano,|last=Michele|publisher=|volume=107|journal=|access-date=19 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913114643/http://www.academia.edu/12137429/_State_Land_Tax_and_Agriculture_in_Iraq_from_the_Arab_Conquest_to_the_Crisis_of_the_Abbasid_Caliphate_Seventh-Tenth_Centuries_in_Studia_Islamica_3_2012_35-80#|archive-date=13 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separatist dynasties and their successors==
The Abbasid Caliphate differed from others in that it did not have the same borders and extent as Islam. Particularly, in the west of the Caliphate, there were multiple smaller caliphates that existed in relative peace with them.{{sfn|Hoiberg|2010|p=10}} This list represents the succession of Islamic dynasties that emerged from the fractured Abbasid empire by their general geographic location. Dynasties often overlap, where a vassal emir revolted from and later conquered his lord. Gaps appear during periods of contest where the dominating power was unclear. Except for the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in Egypt, recognizing a Shia succession through [[Ali]], and the Andalusian Caliphates of the [[Caliphate of Córdoba|Umayyads]] and [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], every Muslim dynasty at least acknowledged the nominal suzerainty of the Abbasids as Caliph and Commander of the Faithful.

==Abbasid Khanate of Bastak==
In 656 AH/1258 CE, the year of the fall of Baghdad, and following the sack of the city, a few surviving members of the Abbasid dynastic family led by the eldest amongst them, Ismail II son of Hamza son of Ahmed son of Mohamed,{{refn|group=nb|For his full genealogy all the way back to Al-Abbas bin Abdulmuttalib, the paternal uncle of the Prophet Mohamed, please see: Al-Abbasi's book ''Nader al-Bayan fi Dhikr Ansab Baniabbassian''&lt;ref name=Alabb&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Abbasi|1986}}{{Page needed | date = January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} made their way into the region of [[Fars Province|Fars]] in Southern [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They settled in the city of [[Khonj]], then a great centre for learning and scholarship. Shaikh Abdulsalam Khonji (b. 661 AH – d. 746 AH) son of Abbas son of Ismail II was born in Khonj only five years after the fall of Baghdad and the arrival of his grandfather in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bosworth|Van Donzel|Lewis|Pellat|1983|p=671}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a great religious scholar and [[Sufi]] [[saint]], held in high esteem by the local populace. His tomb still stands in Khonj and is a site visited by people from near and far.

The descendants of Shaikh Abdulsalam Khonji were religious scholars and figures of great respect and repute for generation after generation. One such scholar and direct descendant of Shaikh Abdulsalam Khonji in the male line, Shaikh Mohamed (d. around 905 AH) son of Shaikh Jaber son of Shaikh Ismail IV, moved to [[Bastak]].&lt;ref name=Alabb/&gt;{{Page needed | date = January 2014}}  His grandson, Shaikh Mohamed the Elder (d. 950 or 975 AH) son of Shaikh Nasser al-Din Ahmed son of Shaikh Mohamed, settled in Khonj for a time. But in 938 AH, in response to growing [[Safavid]] power, Shaikh Mohamed the Elder moved permanently to Bastak as his grandfather had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His own grandson, Shaikh Hassan (d. 1084 AH) (also called Mulla Hassan) son of Shaikh Mohamed the Younger son of Shaikh Mohamed the Elder, is the common ancestor of all the Abbasids of Bastak and its neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaikh Hassan’s grandsons, Shaikh Mohamed Saeed (b. 1096 AH – d. 1152 AH) and Shaikh Mohamed Khan (b. 1113 AH – d. 1197 AH) son of Shaikh Abdulqader son of Shaikh Hassan, became the first two Abbasid rulers of the region. In 1137 AH, Shaikh Mohamed Saeed began gathering support for an armed force. Following the capture of [[Lar, Iran|Lar]], he ruled the city and its dependencies for 12 or 14 years before dying in 1152 AH.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|pp=112–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki, his brother, was meanwhile the ruler of Bastak and the region of Jahangiriyeh. In 1161 AH, Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki departed for Didehban Fortress, leaving Bastak and its dependencies in the hands of his eldest son Shaikh Mohamed Sadeq and his cousin Agha Hassan Khan son of Mulla Ismail.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shaikh Mohamed Khan ruled Jahangiriyeh from Didehban Fortress for a period of roughly 20 to 24 years, for which reason he has been referred to as Shaikh Mohamed "Didehban".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|pp=142, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He eventually returned to Bastak and continued to reign from there up to the time of his death. At the height of his rule, the Khanate of Bastak included not only the region of Jahangiriyeh, but its power also extended to Lar and [[Bandar Abbas]] as well as their dependencies, not to mention several islands in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960|pp=152–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b674&gt;{{harvnb|Bosworth|Van Donzel|Lewis|Pellat|1983|p=674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Floor|2010|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Floor|2011|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1979|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki was the first Abbasid ruler of Bastak to hold the title of "Khan" ([[Persian language|Persian]]: خان, [[Arabic]]: الحاكم), meaning "ruler" or "king", which was bestowed upon him by [[Karim Khan Zand]].&lt;ref name=b674/&gt; The title then became that of all the subsequent Abbasid rulers of Bastak and Jahangiriyeh, and also collectively refers in plural form – i.e., "Khans" ([[Persian language|Persian]]: خوانين) - to the descendants of Shaikh Mohamed Khan Bastaki.

The last Abbasid ruler of Bastak and Jahangiriyeh was Mohamed A’zam Khan Baniabbassian son of Mohamed Reza Khan "Satvat al-Mamalek" Baniabbasi. He authored the book ''Tarikh-e Jahangiriyeh va Baniabbassian-e Bastak'' (1960),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baniabbassian|1960}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which is recounted the history of the region and the Abbasid family that ruled it. Mohamed A’zam Khan Baniabbassian died in 1967, a year regarded as marking the end of the Abbasid reign in Bastak.

==Biography==
Born in 985 CE, Abu `Ali "Mansur" was the first Fatimid ruler to have been born in [[Egypt]]. Abu `Ali "Mansur" had been proclaimed as heir-apparent (wali al-‘ahd) in 993 CE and succeeded his father [[Al-Aziz|Abū Mansūr Nizār al-Azīz]] (975–996) at the age of eleven on 14 October 996 with the caliphal title of ''al-Hakim Bi-Amr Allah''. Al-Ḥākim had [[Eye color#Blue|blue eyes]] flecked with reddish gold.&lt;ref name="Jestice2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phyllis G. Jestice|title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC&amp;pg=PA341|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-355-1|pages=341–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lineage===
Al-Ḥākim was born on Thursday, 3 [[Rabi' al-awwal|Rābi‘u l-Awwal]] in 985 (375 [[Islamic calendar|A.H.]]). His father, Caliph [[Abu Mansur Nizar al-Aziz Billah|Abū Mansūr al-‘Azīz bil-Lāh]], had two consorts. One was an ''[[Ma malakat aymanukum and sex#Rules|umm al-walad]]'' who is only known by the title ''as-Sayyidah al-‘Azīziyyah'' or ''al-‘Azīzah'' (d. 385/995).&lt;ref name="Cortese"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and the Fatimids in the World of Islam|author=Delia Cortese and Simonetta Calderini|year=2006|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=0-7486-1733-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a [[Melkite]] Christian whose two brothers were appointed [[patriarch]]s of the [[Melkite]] Church by Caliph al-‘Azīz.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt; Different sources say either one of her brothers or her father was sent by al-‘Azīz as an ambassador to [[Sicily]].&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt;

Al-‘Azīzah is considered to be the mother of [[Sitt al-Mulk]], one of the most famous women in Islamic history, who had a stormy relationship with her half-brother al-Ḥākim and may have had him murdered.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt; Some, such as the Crusader chronicler [[William of Tyre]], claimed that ''al-‘Azīzah'' was also the mother of Caliph al-Ḥākim, though most historians dismiss this {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. William of Tyre went so far as to claim that al-Ḥākim's destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 1009 was due to his eagerness to disprove taunts that he was a Christian born of a Christian woman.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt; By contrast, the chronicler [[al-Musabbihi]] recounts that in 981, al-Ḥākim's Muslim mother sought the aid of an imprisoned Islamic sage named ibn al-Washa and asked him to pray for her son who had fallen ill. The sage wrote the entire [[Qur'an]] in the inner surface of a bowl and bade her wash her son out of it. When al-Ḥākim recovered, she demanded the release of the sage in gratitude. Her request was granted and the sage and his associates were freed from prison.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt;

Druze sources claim that al-Ḥākim's mother was the daughter of ‘Abdu l-Lāh, one of [[Al-Muizz Lideenillah|al-Mu‘īzz li Dīn al-Lāh]]'s sons and therefore al-‘Azīz's niece.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt; Historians such as Delia Cortese are critical of this claim:{{Quote|[I]t is more likely that this woman was in fact a wife of al-Hakim, rather than his mother. It could be argued that the Druzes' emphasis on al-Hakim's descent from an [[wiktionary:endogamy|endogamic]] union served the doctrinal purpose of reinforcing the charisma genealogically transmitted with the "holy family", thereby enhancing the political and doctrinal status they bestow upon al-Hakim.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt;}}

===Rise to power===
In 996, al-Ḥākim's father Caliph al-‘Azīz began a trip to visit [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] (which was held by the Fatimids only by force of arms and was under pressure from the Byzantines). The Caliph fell ill at the beginning of the trip at [[Bilbeis]] and lay in sickbed for several days. He suffered from "stone with pains in the bowels." When he felt that his end was nearing he charged [[Qadi]] Muhammad ibn an-Nu‘man and General [[al-Hasan ibn Ammar|Abū Muhammad al-Hasan ibn ‘Ammar]] to take care of al-Ḥākim, who was then only eleven. He then spoke to his son. Al-Ḥākim later recalled the event:

{{Quote|"I found him with nothing on his body but rags and bandages. I kissed him, and he pressed me to his bosom, exclaiming: "How I grieve for thee, beloved of my heart," and tears flowed from his eyes. He then said: "Go, my master, and play, for I am well." I obeyed and began to amuse myself with sports such as are usual with boys, and soon after God took him to himself. [[Barjawan]] [the treasurer] then hastened to me, and seeing me on the top of a sycamore tree, exclaimed: "Come down, my boy; may God protect you and us all." When I descended he placed on my head the turban adorned with jewels, kissed the ground before me, and said: "Hail to the Commander of the faithful, with the mercy of God and his blessing." He then led me out in that attire and showed me to all the people, who kissed the ground before me and saluted me with the title of Khalif."&lt;ref name="Short History"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Short History of the Fatimid Khalifate|first=De Lacy |last=O'Leary|authorlink=De Lacy O'Leary|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} On the following day, he and his new court proceeded from Bilbays to Cairo, behind the camel bearing his father's body, and with the dead Caliph's feet protruding from the litter.&lt;ref name="Short History" /&gt; They arrived shortly before evening prayer and his father was buried the next evening next to the tomb of his predecessor al-Mu‘īzz. Al-Ḥākim was sworn in by [[Barjawan]], a "white eunuch whom al-‘Azīz had appointed as ''Ustad'' 'tutor'."&lt;ref name="Short History" /&gt;

Because it had been unclear whether he would inherit his father's position, this successful transfer of power was a demonstration of the stability of the [[Fatimid]] dynasty.

Nevertheless, the [[Kutama]] Berbers seized the chance to recover their dominant position in the state, which had eroded under al-Aziz due to the influx of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] and [[Daylamite]] mercenaries from the Islamic East (the ''Mashāriqa'', "Easterners"). They compelled the underage al-Hakim to dismiss the Christian [[vizier]] [[Ibn Nasturis]] (who was executed shortly after) and appoint their leader Ibn Ammar to head the government, with the title of ''[[Wasita (title)|wāsiṭa]]'' ("intermediary") rather than full vizier.{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=344–346}}{{sfn|Daftary|1992|pp=186–187}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=327–328}} Ibn Ammar's rule quickly descended into a Berber tyranny: he immediately began staffing the government with Berbers, who engaged in a virtual pillaging of the state coffers. The Berbers' attempts to exclude the other interest groups from power—not only the Turks and the other ethnic contingents of the army, but also the civilian bureaucracy, whose salary was cut—alienated not only the ''Mashāriqa'', but alarmed Barjawan as well. Barjawan contacted the Fatimid governor of [[Damascus]], the Turk [[Manjutakin]], and invited him to march onto Egypt and depose Ibn Ammar. Manjutakin accepted, but was defeated by Ibn Ammar's troops under [[Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Falah]] at [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and taken prisoner. Barjawan however soon found a new ally, in the person of the Kutama leader [[Jaysh ibn Samsam]], governor of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], whom Ibn Falah dismissed and replaced with his own brother. Jaysh and Barjawan gathered a following of other dissatisfied Berber leaders, and launched an uprising in [[Cairo]] in October 997. Ibn Ammar was forced to flee, and Barjawan replaced him as ''wāsiṭa''.{{sfn|Daftary|1992|p=187}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=328}}{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=345–346}}

During his predominance, Barjawan managed to balance the two factions, fulfilling the demands of the  ''Mashāriqa'' while taking care of the Kutama as well. In this vein, he pardoned Ibn Ammar and restored him his monthly salary of 500 [[gold dinar]]s. After Bajarwan's murder on 26 March 1000, however, Caliph al-Hakim assumed the reins of government and launched a purge of the Fatimid elites, during which Ibn Ammar and many of the other Kutama leaders were executed.{{sfn|Daftary|1992|p=187}}{{sfn|Lev|1987|pp=345–346}} To ensure his own power, Hakim limited the authority and terms of office of his wasitas and viziers, of whom there were more than 15 during the remaining 20 years of his caliphate.

===Political intrigue===
Al-Ḥākim's father had intended the eunuch Barjawan to act as regent until Al-Ḥākim was old enough to rule by himself. Ibn ‘Ammar and the Qadi Muhammad ibn Nu‘man were to assist in the guardianship of the new caliph. Instead, [[al-Hasan ibn 'Ammar]] (the leader of the [[Kutama]]) immediately seized the office of ''wasīta'' "chief minister" from ‘Īsa ibn Nestorius. At the time the office of ''sifāra'' "secretary of state" was  also combined within that office. Ibn ‘Ammar then took the title of ''Amīn ad-Dawla'' "the one trusted in the empire".&lt;ref name="Short History" /&gt; This was the first time that the term "empire" was associated with the Fatimid state.&lt;ref name="Short History" /&gt;

===Political rivalries and movements===

[[File:AHMosque.jpg|right|thumb|200px| [[Al-Ḥākim Mosque]]]]
Al-Ḥākim's most rigorous and consistent opponent was the [[Abbasid|Abbāsid]] Caliphate in [[Baghdad]], which sought to halt the influence of [[Ismailism]]. This competition led to the [[Baghdad Manifesto]] of 1011, in which the Abbāsids claimed that the line al-Ḥākim represented did not legitimately descend from ‘Alī.

Al-Ḥākim also struggled with the [[Qarmatian|Qarmatiyya]] rulers of [[Bahrain (historical region)|Bahrain]], an island in the [[Persian Gulf]] as well as territory in Eastern Arabia. His diplomatic and missionary vehicle was the [[Ismaili|Ismā'īlī]] ''[[Dawah|da‘wah]]'' "Mission", with its organizational power center in [[Cairo]].

Al-Ḥākim's reign was characterized by a general unrest. The Fatimid army was troubled by a rivalry between two opposing factions, the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and the [[Berber people|Berbers]]. Tension grew between the Caliph and his viziers (called ''wasīta''s), and near the end of his reign the [[Druze]] movement, a religious sect centered around al-Ḥākim, began to form. Members of that sect were reported to address prayers to al-Ḥākim, whom they regarded as "a manifestation of God in His unity."&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Edward, ''Faith and Power: The Politics of Islam'', Vintage Books, 1982, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Baghdad Manifesto===
Alarmed by the expansion of the Fatimid dominion, the ‘Abbasid caliph [[Al-Qadir]] of [[Baghdad]] adopted retaliatory measures to halt the spread of Ismailism within the very seat of his realm. In particular, in 1011 he assembled a number of [[Sunni]] and [[Twelver|Twelver Shiite]] scholars at his court and commanded them to declare in a written document that Hakim and his predecessors lacked genuine descent from [[Ali]] and [[Fatimah|Fatima]]. This so-called [[Baghdad Manifesto]] was read out in Friday mosques throughout the ‘Abbasid domains accusing the Fatimids of Jewish ancestry.  In addition, because of Al-Hakim's alleged Christian mother, he was accused of being over-sympathetic to non-Muslims, giving them more privileges than they should have been given under Islamic rule.  Such accusations were manifested through poetry criticizing the Fatimids. Qadir also commissioned several refutations of Ismaili doctrines, including those written by the [[Mu'tazila|Mu‘tazili]] ‘Ali b. Sa‘id al-Istakri (1013).&lt;ref name="Daftary"/&gt;

===Foreign affairs===
Hakim confronted numerous difficulties and uprisings during his relatively long reign. While he did not lose any important territories in [[North Africa]], the Ismaili communities there were attacked by [[Sunni]] fighters led by their influential [[Maliki]] jurists. Relations between the Fatimids and the [[Qarmatians]] of Bahrain also remained hostile. On the other hand, Hakim's Syrian policy was successful as he managed to extend Fatimid hegemony to the emirate of [[Aleppo]]. Above all, the persistent rivalries between the various factions of the Fatimid armies, especially the [[Berber people|Berbers]] and the [[Turkish people|Turks]], overshadowed the other problems of Hakim's caliphate.

Al-Ḥākim upheld diplomatic relations between the Fatimid Empire and many different countries. Skillful diplomacy was needed in establishing a friendly if not neutral basis of relations with the [[Byzantine Empire]], which had expansionary goals in the early 11th century. Perhaps the farthest reaching diplomatic mission of al-Ḥākim's was to [[Song Dynasty]] era China.&lt;ref name="shen 158"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shen, Fuwei|year=1996|title=Cultural flow between China and the outside world|publisher=Beijing: Foreign Languages Press|isbn=7-119-00431-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fatimid Egyptian sea captain known as [[Domiyat]] traveled to a [[Buddhist]] site of pilgrimage in [[Shandong]] in the year 1008&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="shen 158" /&gt; It was on this mission that he sought to present to the Chinese [[Emperor Zhenzong of Song]] gifts from his ruling Caliph al-Ḥākim.&lt;ref name="shen 158" /&gt; This reestablished diplomatic relations between Egypt and China that had been lost during the collapse of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in 907.&lt;ref name="shen 158" /&gt;

===Disappearance===
In the final years of his reign, Hakim displayed a growing inclination toward [[asceticism]] and withdrew for meditation regularly. On the night of 12/13 February 1021 and at the age of 36, Hakim left for one of his night journeys to the [[Mokattam]] hills outside of [[Cairo]], and never returned.  A search found only his donkey and bloodstained garments. The disappearance has remained a mystery.&lt;ref name="Daftary"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iis.ac.uk/view_article.asp?ContentID=104798 |title=al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah |work=Encyclopaedia Iranica, Vol. 11, pp. 572-573, ed.

Al-Ḥākim was succeeded by his young son [[Ali az-Zahir]] under the regency of his sister [[Sitt al-Mulk]].

== [[Sobriquet]] in Western literature==
In Western literature he has been referred to as the "Mad Caliph".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/252121/al-Hakim Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4QwwnrZgvbEC&amp;pg=PA16 The First Crusade: A New History, Thomas Asbridge]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j2MIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA604 Britannica 1810]&lt;/ref&gt; This title is largely due to his erratic and oppressive behavior concerning religious minorities under his command, as historian Hunt Janin relates: al-Hakim "was known as the 'Mad Caliph' because of his many cruelties and eccentricities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pursuit of Learning in the Islamic World, 610-2003|author=Hunt Janin|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company Inc|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Michael Bonner points out that the term is also used due to the dramatic difference between al-Hakim and his predecessors and his successors while also pointing out such persecution is an extreme rarity in Islam during this era. "In his capital of Cairo, this unbalanced (and, in the view of most, mad) caliph raged against the Christians in particular...On the whole such episodes remained exceptional, like the episodes of forced conversion to Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jihad in Islamic History: Doctrines and Practice|author=Michael Bonner|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Michael Foss also notes this contrast "For more than three hundred and fifty years, from the time when the Caliph Omar made a treaty with the Patriarch Sophronius until 1009, when mad al-Hakim began attacks on Christians and Jews, the city of Jerusalem and the Holy Land were open to the West, with an easy welcome and the way there was no more dangerous than a journey from Paris to Rome....Soon [after al-Hakim] the panic was over. In 1037 al-Mustansir came to an amicable agreement with Emperor Michael IV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=People of the First Crusade: The Truth About the Christian-Muslim War Revealed|author=Michael Foss|year=1997|publisher=Arcade Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one prominent journal has noted, al-Ḥākim has attracted the interest of modern historians more than any other member of the Fatimid dynasty because: &lt;blockquote&gt;"His eccentric character, the inconsistencies and radical shifts in his conduct and policies, the extreme austerity of his personal life, the vindictive and sanguinary ruthlessness of his dealing with the highest officials of his government coupled with an obsession to suppress all signs of corruption and immorality in public life, his attempted annihilation of [[Christians]] and call for the systematic destruction of all Christian holy places in the middle east culminating in the destruction of the most holy [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Church of the Resurrection]] in [[Jerusalem]], his deification by a group of extremist [[Ismaili|Isma'li]] missionaries who became the forerunners and founders of the [[Druze]] religion, [which] all combine to contrast his reign sharply with that of any of his predecessors and successors and indeed of any Muslim ruler.... The question is to what extent his conduct can be explained as rationally motivated and conditioned by the circumstances rather than as the inscrutable workings of an insane mind."&lt;ref name="JNE 37"&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Near Eastern Studies: Vol. 37, No. 3, Pg. 280|author=Wilferd Madelung|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The claim that al-Hakim was mad and the version of events around him is disputed as mere propaganda by some scholars, such as Willi Frischaue, who states: "His enemies called him the 'Mad Caliph' but he enhanced Cairo's reputation as a centre of civilization."&lt;ref name="Aga"/&gt; The writing of historian [[Heinz Halm]] attempts to dispel "those distorted and hostile accounts, stating that the anti-Fatimid tradition tried to make a real monster of this caliph."&lt;ref name="Poonawala"/&gt;

==Al Hakim and Shia Ismailism==
{{see also|Ismailism}}
Hakim maintained a keen interest in the organization and operation of the Fatimid Ismaili da‘wa (preaching) centred in Cairo. Under his reign it was systematically intensified outside the Fatimid dominions especially in [[Iraq]] and [[Persia]]. In Iraq, the da‘is now concentrated their efforts on a number of local [[amir]]s and influential tribal chiefs with whose support they aimed to uproot the [[Abbasids]]. Foremost among the Fatimid da‘is of this period operating in the eastern provinces was [[Hamid al-Din Kirmani]], the most accomplished Ismaili theologian-philosopher of the entire Fatimid period. The activities of Kirmani and other da‘is soon led to concrete results in Iraq: in 1010 the ruler of [[Mosul]], [[Kufa]] and other towns acknowledged the suzerainty of Hakim.&lt;ref name="Daftary"/&gt;

===House of Knowledge===
In the area of education and learning, one of Hakim's most important contributions was the founding in 1005 of the ''[[House of Knowledge|Dar al-Alem]]'' (House of Knowledge) or ''Dar al-Hikma'' (House of Wisdom).&lt;ref&gt;Maqrizi, 1853–54, 1995; Halm, 1997, pp. 71–78&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of subjects ranging from the Qur'an and [[hadith]] to [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]] were taught at the Dar al-alem, which was equipped with a vast library. Access to education was made available to the public and many Fatimid da‘is received at least part of their training in this major institution of learning which served the Ismaili da‘wa (mission) until the downfall of the Fatimid dynasty.&lt;ref name="Daftary"/&gt;

In 1013 he completed the [[mosque]] in [[Cairo]] begun by his father, the [[Al-Hakim Mosque|Masjid al-Hākim]] "Hākim's Mosque" whose official name is "Jame-ul-Anwar". Over time the mosque fell to ruins. In the 1970s the Bohras Mission group (who claim to be descendants of the Fatimid dynasty) under [[Mohammed Burhanuddin|Dr. Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin]], attempted a restoration of the then dilapidated Al-Hakim Mosque. Their attempts received strong criticism from academics, conservators, and art historians who saw the effort as entirely reconstructing to "a new building" rather than restoration. In response to the criticism the Bohras group ceased attempts at any more building restorations in Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page= 225|journal=Building Peace by Intercultural Dialogue|title="Islamic Cairo imagined: from a historical city slum to a time machine for tourism?"|author=Susanna Myllylä|url=http://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/68235/building_peace_by_intercultural_dialogue_2008.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sessions of Wisdom===
Hakim made the education of the Ismailis and the Fatimid da‘is a priority; in his time various study sessions (''majalis'') were established in Cairo. Hakim provided financial support and endowments for these educational activities. The private ‘wisdom sessions’ (majalis al-hikma) devoted to [[esoteric]] Ismaili doctrines and reserved exclusively for initiates, now became organized so as to be accessible to different categories of participants. Al Hakim himself often attended these sessions which were held at the Fatimid palace.&lt;ref name="Daftary"/&gt; The name (majalis al-hikma) is still adopted by the Druze and Taiyabi Ismailis as the name of the building in which their religious assembly and worship is carried, it's often abbreviated as Majlis (session).

===Druze===
Al-Hakim is a central figure in the history of the [[Druze]] religious sect.&lt;ref name="Daftary"/&gt;

==Interreligious relationships==
According to the religious scholar [[Nissim Dana]], al-Ḥākim's relationship with other monotheistic religions can be divided into three separate stages.&lt;ref name="Dana"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nissim Dana|title=The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=2003|isbn=1-903900-36-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First period===
From 996 to 1006 when most of the executive functions of the Khalif were performed by his advisors, the [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] al-Ḥākim "behaved like the Shiite khalifs, who he succeeded, exhibiting a hostile attitude with respect to [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Muslims, whereas the attitude toward '[[People of the Book]]' – Jews and Christians – was one of relative tolerance, in exchange for the [[jizya]] tax."&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt;

In 1005, al-Ḥākim ordered a public posting of curses against the first three Caliphs ([[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]] and [[Uthman]]) and against [[Aisha]], wife of [[Muhammad]], for denying the caliphate to Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law ‘Alī, who according to Shia beliefs, was the rightful prophetic successor.

According to historian Nissîm Dānā, al-Ḥākim ordered that "curses were registered against the warrior [[Muawiyah I]], founder of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], and against others in the inner circle of Muhammad from the [[Sahabah]] - the compatriots of Muhammad in the way of Islam."&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt; This was in accordance with Shia practice, as laid out by Muslim scholar Ayatollah Haydari "the followers of [[Ahl al-Bayt]] [Shias] say 'O Allah curse all of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Banu Umayya]]'."&lt;ref name="Kawthar"/&gt; The Shia maintain that out of hatred for ‘Alī, Mu‘awiyah ordered the [[Talbiyah]] not be said (as it was promoted by ‘Alī) and ordered people to curse him ([[Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas]] refused to do so). The Shia hold that Mu‘awiyah and all of the Umayyid caliphs (with the possible exception of [[Umar II]]) were [[Nasibi]] who "are the hypocrites for whom hatred of ‘Alī is their religion...They don't just hate ‘Alī, but they worship Allah and seek closeness to Him by hating ‘Alī."&lt;ref name="Kawthar"&gt;{{cite video|people=Ayatollah Seyyid Kamal Haydari|work=Al-Kawthar tv|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHaGoerzUsg&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=Muawiya ibn Abi Sufyan's hatred for Imam Ali- Seyyid Kamal Haydari ENG SUBS|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;!-- copyvio video? Does not appear to be authorized by the TV network Al-Kawthar tv. --&gt;{{dubious|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After only two years of posting the curses, al-Ḥākim ended the practice.&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt; During this era, al-Ḥākim ordered that the inclusion of the phrase ''as-salāh khayr min an-nawm'' "prayer is preferable to sleep", which followed [[fajr prayer]], be stopped – he saw it as a Sunni addition. In its place he ordered that ''ḥayyi ‘alā khayr al-‘amal'' "come to the best of deeds" should be said after the summons was made. He further forbade the use of two prayers – ''Salāt at-Tarāwih'' and ''Salāt ad-Duha'' as they were believed to have been formulated by Sunni sages.&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt;

====Religious minorities and the law of differentiation====
In 1004 Al-Hakim decreed that the Christians could no longer celebrate [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] or [[Easter]].&lt;ref name="Robert Ousterhout 1989 pp. 66-78"&gt;Robert Ousterhout, "Rebuilding the Temple: Constantine Monomachus and the Holy Sepulchre" in ''The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians'', Vol. 48, No. 1 (March, 1989), pp.
66–78&lt;/ref&gt;  He also outlawed the use of wine ([[Islamic dietary laws#Alcohol|''nabidh'']]) and even other intoxicating drinks not made from grapes (''fuqa'') to both Muslims and non-Muslims alike.&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt; This produced a hardship for both Christians (who [[Christian views on alcohol#Alcohol in Christian history and tradition|used wine in their religious rites]]) and Jews (who [[Kosher wine#Role of wine in Jewish holidays and rituals|used it in their religious festivals]]).

In 1005, al-Ḥākim ordered that Jews and Christians follow ''ghiyār'' "the law of differentiation" – in this case, the ''mintaq'' or ''zunnar'' "belt" (Greek ζωνάριον) and ''‘imāmah'' "turban", both in black. In addition, Jews must wear a wooden calf necklace and Christians an iron cross. In the public baths, Jews must replace the calf with a bell. In addition, women of the [[People of the Book]] had to wear two different coloured shoes, one red and one black. These remained in place until 1014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Following contemporary Shiite thinking, during this period al-Ḥākim also issued many other restrictive ordinances (''sijillat''). These ''sijill'' included outlawing entrance to a public bath with uncovered loins, forbidding women from appearing in public with their faces uncovered, and closing many clubs and places of entertainment.&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt;

===Second period===
From 1007 to 1012 "there was a notably tolerant attitude toward the Sunnis and less zeal for Shiite Islam, while the attitude with regard to the 'People of the Book' was hostile."&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt;  On 18 October 1009, al- Hakim ordered the destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Holy Sepulchre]] and its associated buildings, apparently outraged by what he regarded as the fraud practiced by the monks in the "miraculous" Descent of the [[Holy Fire]], celebrated annually at the church during the Easter Vigil.  The chronicler Yahia noted that "only those things that were too difficult to demolish were spared." Processions were prohibited, and a few years later all of the convents and churches in Palestine were said to have been destroyed or confiscated.&lt;ref name="Robert Ousterhout 1989 pp. 66-78" /&gt; It was only in 1042 that the [[Byzantine]] [[Emperor]] [[Constantine IX]] undertook to reconstruct the Holy Sepulchre with the permission of Al-Hakim's successor.

===Third period===
al-Ḥākim ultimately allowed the unwilling Christian and Jewish converts to Islam to return to their faith and rebuild their ruined houses of worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O45CAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+walker+arnold+preaching |title=The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith |author= Sir Thomas Walker Arnold |page=343 |publisher=A.

Ironically he developed a particularly hostile attitude with regard to the Muslim Shiites. It was during this period, in the year 1017, that the unique religion of the [[Druze]] began to develop as an independent religion based on the revelation (''[[Kashf]]'') of al-Ḥākim as divine.&lt;ref name="Dana" /&gt;}}

While it is clear that [[Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad|Hamza ibn Ahmad]] was the Caliph's chief ''dāʿī''; there are claims that al-Ḥākim believed in his own divinity.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito]], ''Islam: the Straight Path'', p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nissim Dana |title=The Druze in the Middle East: Their Faith, Leadership, Identity and Status |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2nCWIsyZJxUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3 |page= 3 | publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year= 2003 |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Mordechai Nisan]] |title=Minorities in the Middle East: A History of Struggle and Self-expression |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=keD9z1XWuNwC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95  |page=95 |publisher= McFarland |year= 2002 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cherine Badawi |title=Egypt |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9-_tLE0saAC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96 |page=96 |publisher=Footprint |year= 2004|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zeidan Atashi |title=Druze and Jews in Israel: A Shared Destiny? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DescF3BhLIC&amp;pg=PA12 |page=12 |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |year=1997 |accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars disagree with this assertion of direct divinity, particularly the Druze themselves, noting that its proponent was [[ad-Darazi]], who (according to some resources) al-Ḥākim executed for ''shirk''. Letters show that ad-Darazi was trying to gain control of the ''Muwahhidun'' movement and this claim was an attempt to gain support from the Caliph, who instead found it heretical.&lt;ref name="Dix"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Druze find this assertion offensive; they hold ad-Darazi as the first apostate of the sect and their beliefs regarding al-Ḥākim are complex. Following a typical Isma'ili pattern, they place a preeminent teacher at the innermost circle of divinely inspired persons. For the Druze, the exoteric is taught by the Prophet, the esoteric by his secret assistants, and the esoteric of the esoteric by Imām al-Ḥākim.

Confusion and slander by opponents of the Druze were generally left uncorrected as the teachings of the sect are secret and the Druze preferred [[taqiyya]] when independence was impossible.

==Spouses and children==
The mother of al-Ḥākim's heir [[Ali az-Zahir|‘Alī az-Zāhir]] was the ''umm al-walad'' Amīna Ruqayya, daughter to the late prince ‘Abdu l-Lāh, son of al-Mu‘īzz. Some see her as the same as the woman in the prediction reported by al-Hamidi which held "that in 390/1000 al-Ḥākim would choose an orphan girl of good stock brought up his father al-Aziz and that she would become the mother of his successor."&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt; While the chronicler al-Maqrizi claims that al-Ḥākim's stepsister Sitt al-Mulk was hostile to Amīna, other sources say she gave her and her child refuge when they were fleeing al-Ḥākim's persecution.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt; Some sources say al-Ḥākim married the ''jariya'' (young female servant) known by the title as-Sayyidah but historians are unsure if this is just another name for Amīna.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt;

Besides his son, al-Ḥākim had a daughter named Sitt Misr (d. 455/1063) who was said to be a generous patroness and of noble and good character.&lt;ref name="Cortese" /&gt;

==In literature==
The story of Hakim's life inspired (presumably through [[Antoine Isaac Silvestre de Sacy]]) the French author [[Gérard de Nerval]] (1808-1855) who recounted his version of it (“Histoire du Calife Hakem”: ''History of the Caliph Hakem'') as an appendix to his ''[[Voyage to the Orient]]'' (1851). He is a major character in ''The Prisoner of Al-Hakim'' by American novelist [[Bradley Steffens]], which recounts the ten-year imprisonment of [[Ibn al-Haytham]] under Al-Hakim's rule.&lt;ref&gt;The Prisoner of Al-Hakim.

===Krishna Janmashtami===
[[Krishna Janmashtami]] or Gokul Ashtami is a Hindu festival celebrating the birth of Lord [[Krishna]], an avatar of Hindu deity Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Srinivasan2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Srinivasan|title=Hinduism For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GnvXy2RlqrcC&amp;pg=PA241|accessdate=19 May 2012|series='''Krishna Janmashtami'''|date=12 July 2011|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-0-470-87858-3|pages=241–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna Janmashtami is observed on the Ashtami tithi, the eighth day of the dark half or Krishna Paksha of the month of Bhaadra in the Hindu calendar, when the Rohini Nakshatra (called Aldebaran in the West) is ascendant. Rasa lila or dramatic enactments of the life of Krishna are a special feature in regions of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], and [[Vrindavan]], [[Nalbari]] and regions following Vaishnavism in Manipur.&lt;ref name="Wilhelm"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernst Wilhelm|title=Classical Muhurta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zMPFJy6YygC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=19 May 2012|series='''Ashtami'''|publisher=Kala Occult Publishers|isbn=978-0-9709636-2-8|pages=36–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trilochana Ashtami or Trilochanashtami (त्रिलोचन अष्टमी), is a [[Hindu]] auspicious day dedicated to Lord [[Shiva]] and Goddess [[Parvati]] celebrated in [[Odisha]] and different parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dharm.raftaar.in/Religion/Hinduism Hindu Dharma Festivals]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tri''(त्रि) means Three and ''lochan''(लोचन) means Eye. Hence one who having three eyes is called as Trilochan (त्रिलोचन) literally means to [[Lord Shiva]], three-eyed, that is, indication of the present, past and future.&lt;ref name="Sharma2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal Prashad Sharma|title=Maṇimahesh Chambā Kailāsh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFUa0rH0yUcC&amp;pg=PA135|accessdate=19 May 2012|series='''Trilochanashtami (त्रिलोचन अष्टमी)'''|date=1 August 2001|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=978-81-7387-118-4|pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Slavic mythology]], '''bolotnik''' ({{lang-rus|болотник, literally «swamp man», translit. bolotnik}}), Belarusian '''balotnik''' ({{lang-be|балотнiк}}), Ukrainian '''bolotyanik''' ({{lang-uk|болотяник}}) is a male swamp spirit. There are many descriptions of bolotnik. Usually he was portrayed  as a man or an old man who has big, frog-like eyes, a green beard and long hair. His body is covered with dirt, algae and fish scales. Other legends says, that a bolotnik is dirty, fat, eyeless creature that motionlessly sits at the bottom of the swamp. In some legends bolotnik is also said to have long arms and a tail. Like the [[Vodyanoy|vodyanoy]] or [[Rusalka|rusalka]], he lures and drags people into the water if they get close to the edge. It is believed that bolotnik has neither wife nor children; in the other legends he is married on bolotnitsa (or bolotnica),&lt;ref name="Новичкова"&gt;{{cite book| author = Новичкова Т. А. | chapter = Болотник| chapter-url = | format = |url =  | title = Русский демонологический словарь | orig-year = | agency =  | edition =  {{nowrap|4100 экз}} |location= СПб. |year= 1995 |publisher= Петербургский писатель |at=  |volume=  |issue = | pages = 59| page =  | series =  | isbn = 5-265-02803-X| ref = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a female swamp spirit, similar to a rusalka.

== Name ==
Bolotnik has a lot of names: bolotny (Russian: болотный; literally «swampy»), bolotny dedko (Russian: болотный дедко; «swamp oldman»), shut bolotny (Russian: шут болотный; «swamp jester»), bolotny chert (Russian: болотный чёрт; «swamp demon»), bolotny [[Leshy|leshy]] (Russian: болотный леший), tsar bolotny (Russian: царь болотный), boloto (Russian: болото; «swamp»), ancibal (Russian: анцибал),&lt;ref name="Новичкова"/&gt; ancibul (Russian: анцибул), ancibalka (Russian: анцибалка), ancibalit (Russian: анцибалит), anchibal (Russian: анчибал), anchibol (Russian: анчибол), Belarusian balotnik (Belarusian: балотнiк), Ukrainian bolotyanik (Ukrainian: болотяник), ocheretyanik (Russian: очеретяник).

== Behavior ==
It is believed that bolotnik and bolotnitsa lured people or animals to the swamp, where they would die.

To lure people to the swamp, a bolotnik quacked like a duck, mooed like a cow, gurgled like a black cock or screamed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Виноградова, Людмила Николаевна|Виноградова Л.

When a person is already in the quagmire, bolotnik grabs him by the feet and slowly, but inevitably drags him to the depths.

== Bolotnitsa ==
In the Russian North it is believed, that '''bolotnitsa''' (bolotnica) is the mistress of the swamp and tundra.&lt;ref name="Новичкова"/&gt; Like the bolotnik, there are many different descriptions of her. In one legend she is a rusalka (or a rusalka's sister). It was believed, for example, that a girl, who had died in a swamp or was carried away by an unclean spirit, could turn into the bolotnitsa. In some places bolotnitsa was considered to be more like a spirit that had no connections with the human race. Bolotnitsa was portrayed as a beautiful young girl with pale-white skin and goose legs instead of normal legs. To hide them, bolotnitsa would sit on a giant water lily, putting her legs under her. She lured people into the swamp with a loud cry for help and pretending that she was drowning. If they were charmed by her beauty, people would get close to her. She would then pounce on them and slowly pull them to the bottom of the swamp. It was believed that bolotnitsa liked to sing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Brougher V.

Bolotnitsas also can cause [[Storm|storm]]s, [[Rain|rain]] and [[Hail|hail]].

'''Buddhism in Hungary''' exists since 1951 when [[Ernő Hetényi]] founded Buddhist Mission in [[Germany]] as a member of the Arya Maitreya Mandala Buddhist order ([[Mahayana]] school). However, the first [[Sangha|Buddhist community]] had been founded in the 1890s in [[Sighetu Marmației|Máramarossziget]] (today Sighetu Marmației, part of [[Romania]]). [[József Hollósy]] took [[Refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] and he wrote ''Buddhista Kátét'' (1893) the first Buddhist [[catechism]] in Hungarian. According to this [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] has been present in Hungary for more than a century. In 1933 [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] philologist and Orientalist, author of the first [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]-[[English language|English]] dictionary and grammar book [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]] was recognised as a [[bodhisattva]] in [[Japan]]. In Hungary József Hollósy is regarded as the second bodhisattva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkbe.hu/emlekoldal/hollosy-jozsef www.tkbe.hu - Hollósy József]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hungary Buddhism has several forms, all of them with their own independent school of thought. The different organisations coexist fairly harmoniously, but active communication between them is rather feeble.&lt;ref&gt;[http://terebess.hu/keletkultinfo/karpaty.html www.terebess.hu - Kárpáty Ágnes: Buddhizmus Magyarországon]&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially seven [[stupa]]s have been inaugurated in Hungary: two in [[Budapest]], and one in [[Budakeszi]], [[Bükkmogyorósd]] ([[Csernely]]), [[Zalaszántó]], [[Tar, Hungary|Tar]], and Becskén. The Peace Stupa in Zalaszántó is the biggest Buddhist shrine in Europe with a 30 meter height and 24 meter width.&lt;ref&gt;[http://turizmus.zalatermalvolgye.hu/node/280 www.turizmus.zalatermavolgye.hu - Buddhista sztúpa]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hungary has a Buddhist high-school named after [[B. R. Ambedkar]]&lt;ref name="www.ambedkar.hu"&gt;http://www.dzsajbhim.hu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ambedkar.hu/|title=Dr. Ámbédkar Iskola|accessdate=2016-06-01|work=www.ambedkar.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a college ([[Dharma Gate Buddhist College]]).&lt;ref name="www.tkbf.hu"&gt;[http://www.tkbf.hu/ www.tkbf.hu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Beginning===
[[File:Travel route and timeline of Sándor Kőrösi Csoma.svg|thumb|left|250px|Route travelled by Körösi Csoma]]
The ancient religion of Hungarian tribes was [[shamanism]] but presumably they had come across Buddhism during their westward migration and some of them had probably adopted Buddhism as their religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://letezes.keresztesattila.hu/blog/kinai-japan-osi-magyar-kereszteny-es-buddhista-vallas-es-pszichologia-egysege-isten-segit-isten-hata-mogott-van-e-isten-isten-neve-szeretete-igeje-szava/ www.keresztesattila.hu - A bölcsesség győkere az ősvallásokban]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to religious tolerance of Buddhism it was possible to practice two or more traditions at the same time, just like in the case of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Mongols|Mongolian]] tribes. In the 15th century a Geleotti, humanist philosopher, running away from [[inquisition]] found refuge at the court of [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[king of Hungary]]. Galeotti called the [[Gautama Siddhartha|Buddha]] an "Indian sage" and he thought that the capital of the country, [[Buda]] was named after him.

[[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]], in the hope of finding the ancient homeland of the Hungarians, wanted to travel to [[India]] via [[Afghanistan]], and further on to [[Mongolia]] via [[Tibet]]. Eventually he only got to reach [[Ladakh]] in Northern India. During this period at [[Zanskar]] (he was the first European to visit the valley), he was immersed in an intense sixteen-month study of the Tibetan language and the Indo-Tibetan Buddhism at the core of its literature, with a local lama, Sangs-rgyas-phun-tshogs. He was one of the first Europeans to master the Tibetan language and read two of the great encyclopaedias of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist literature the [[Kangyur]] (100 volumes) and the [[Tengyur|bsTan-'gyur]] (224 volumes) which contained translations of Buddhist books brought from India.&lt;ref&gt;Saint-Hilaire, J.-B. ''Buddha and his Religion''. Twickenham: Tiger Books International, 1998 {{ISBN|1-85170-540-6}} p19&lt;/ref&gt;
Kőrösi Csoma was given bodhisattva title in Tokyo in 1933 at the Taishyo Buddhist University as Csoma Bosatsu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddha-tar.hu/hu/korosi_a_megvilagosult www.buddha-tar.hu - A megvilágosult]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osmagyaregyhaz.hu/kocsoma.html www.osmagyaregyhaz.hu - Kőrösi Csoma Sándor]&lt;/ref&gt;

===After Kőrösi Csoma===
Buddhism appeared first in Hungary in the end of the 1890s, when [[József Hollósy]], brother of painter [[Simon Hollósy]], took refuge and wrote ''Buddhista Káté'' (1893).

[[László Mednyánszky]] was working on the sketches of the [[Arrival of the Hungarians]], painting of [[Árpád Feszty]], in [[Máramarossziget]]. József Hollósy lead a Buddhist circle which became a great influence for Mednyánszky. As a result, he dedicated the rest of his life to Buddhism. Mednyánszky was the first Hungarian artist to represent Buddhism with his choice of colours and themes.&lt;ref name="www.tkbe.hu - Mednyánszki László"&gt;[http://www.tkbe.hu/emlekoldal/mednyanszki-laszlo www.tkbe.hu - Mednyánszki László]&lt;/ref&gt;
There was another Buddhist community in Budapest between 1931 and 1935. The main figures were [[László Vágó]] wholesaler and [[Tibor Boromisza]] painter. Their seals represented Buddha under a [[székely gate]] (ornate door) surrounded by an epigraph: „Magyar Buddhisták”  (Hungarian Buddhists).&lt;ref&gt;[http://buddhapestujsag.blog.hu/2010/06/12/dr_hetenyi_erno_es_a_magyarorszagi_buddhizmus_hoskora www.buddhapestujsag.blog.hu dr. Hetényi Ernő és a magyarországi buddhizmus hőskora]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Géza Gárdonyi]] also believed in [[reincarnation]] and there was a time when he wanted to convert to Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhapest.hu/2012/02/gardonyi-geza-lelekvandorlas.html www.buddhapest.hu - Gárdonyi Géza - Lélekvándorlás]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tudasbazis.sulinet.hu/hu/magyar-nyelv-es-irodalom/irodalom/irodalom-6-osztaly/a-szerzo-es-kora/gardonyi-geza-es-eger www.tudasbazis.sulinet.hu - Gardonyi Géza és Eger]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official Sangha in Hungary was founded in 1951-ben by [[Ernő Hetényi]] who was ordained in Germany in 1938. The actual date of the foundation of the Hungarian Buddhist Mission is 18 February 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkbe.hu/emlekoldal/dr-hetenyi-erno-lama-dharmakirti-padmavadzsra www.tkbe.hu - dr Hetényi Ernő - Láma Dharmakirti Padmavadzsra ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Arya Maitreya Mandala German Buddhist order was founded by [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]], German traveller, philosopher, painter, and poet. This order belongs to Mahayana and its rites follow the Tibetan tradition. Ernő Hetényi was the third person who graduated from this order. In 1956 the Buddhist Mission was declared Eastern European centre to promote Buddhism in the neighbouring countries. The mission aimed at representing all Buddhist schools without partiality. The foundation of [[Kőrösi Csoma Sándor International Buddhology Institute]] in [[Berlin]] was aimed to achieve the same goal. During his eastern travels Hetényi visited monasteries in [[India]], [[Mongolia]], [[Buryatia]], and [[Laos]]. He received [[Empowerment (Vajrayana)|empowerment]] from Tibetan and Mongolian lamas and in 1982 he was blessed by [[Tenzin Gyatso|the 14th Dalai Lama]] whom he met three times.

In 1990, due to several issues, the Kőrösi Csoma Sándor Institute was closed, but later, two great historical figures of Hungarian Buddhism, Dobosy Antal and Takács László, reorganised and reopened it. After this Buddhist orders and schools were open throughout the country. The sudden liberty and the large number of institutions also involved some degree of drop in quality. New books appeared which were mainly translations from English. A large part of the works of [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]] remain untranslated to this day.

He spent the night in the guest house of government of the Hungarian Peoples Republic. He was welcomed on behalf of the government by [[József Marjai]], chief prime minister of Hungary. At the airport waiting lounge he met the Mongolian ambassador, and [[Ernő Hetényi]], founder and leader of the Hungarian Buddhist Mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gerlo.hu/hvall/enci/magyarbuddha.html|publisher= Gerlo.hu|title= A buddhizmus Magyarországon|accessdate= 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama was invited by several Hungarian Buddhist institutions and he paid a visit to Hungary between 25 and 30 April 1990. During his stay he gave [[Chenrezig]] empowerment at the [[Corvinus University of Budapest|Marx Károly University of Economics]] (today [[Corvinus University of Budapest]]), and he gave sermon in [[St. Stephen's Basilica]] together with [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[László Paskai]] and other representatives of the historically important churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mtva.hu/en/sajto-es-fotoarchivum/25-eve-toertent-a-magyarorszagi-rendszervaltozas-1990-aprilis-27-majus-3-kronologia|publisher= MTVA.hu|title= 25 éve történt a magyarországi rendszerváltozás, 1990. április 27-május 3. - KRONOLÓGIA|accessdate= 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 20 and 25 July 1992 he paid visit to Hungary for the invitation of [[Chan Buddhism|Csan Buddhist Church]] amongst others. His public speech in [[Budapest Sportcsarnok]] was attended by 4000 people, his teaching at [[Corvinus University of Budapest]] was also great success amongst the students. His Holiness also travelled to [[Tar, Hungary|Tar]] village to give his blessings to a newly built 13-meter-high stupa dedicated to the 150th anniversary of the death of Sándor Kőrösi Csoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tarrdaniel.com/documents/WebDesign/DalaiLamaBudapest/rendezveny.html|publisher= Tarr Dániel| title= Őszentésge a Dalai Láma látogatása Budapesten|accessdate= 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; One year later the Dalai Lama consecrated the 36-meter-high stupa in [[Zalaszántó]] which became the highest such building in Europe. The Dalai Lama visited Hungary on 27 and 28 October 1996 and he met several politicians, religious leaders, scientists and artists. He signed the Proclamation of Planetary Mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bocs.hu/eletharm/bp-club3.htm|publisher= Bocs.hu| title= KIÁLTVÁNY A PLANETÁRIS TUDATRÓL|accessdate= 2015-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a public speech in the Congressional Centre of Builders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5269">'''Clarence Bertrand Thompson''' (1882 - 1969) was an American business academic, chemist, business consultant and Unitarian minister. He was the first [[African-American]] graduate of the [[University of Southern California Law School]], known for his work on [[scientific management]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wren, Daniel A.]], et al. "C. Bertrand Thompson and management consulting in Europe, 1917-1934." ''Journal of Management History'' 21.1 (2015): 15-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson was the brother of Black newspaperman Noah Davis Thompson whose wife was [[Eloise Bibb Thompson]]. Thompson was also the uncle of [[Anita Thompson Dickinson Reynolds]].

== Biography ==
Thompson was born in Denver, where his father, a former Union Navy soldier, worked as jeweler. At the age of 8 his parents got divorced, and he moved with his mother, the daughter of an escaped slave, to Los Angeles. He studied law at the [[University of Southern California]], attending a law degree at the age of 18.&lt;ref name="JAB 2004"&gt;John A. Buehrens. "Famous consultant and forgotten minister: Grandson of a slave, Clarence Bertrand Thompson was a Unitarian minister, management expert, and biochemist." in: ''UU World,'' January/February 2004. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation in 1900 Thompson in Los Angeles joined an independent liberal congregation, called The Fellowship, where he became assistant minister in 1905. That year he moved to Massachusetts, where he served as minister of the Unitarian Church of Peabody, and started his studies at Harvard. In 1906 he obtained his BA in law, and in 1907 his MA in sociology and economics in 1907.&lt;ref name="JAB 2004"/&gt;
 
In 1908 he resigned from the Unitarian Church, and started working at the Boston Chamber of Commerce, where he was introduced by [[Edward Filene]]. He was an early proponent of the techniques developed by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. In 1910 Harvard opened a new Business School, where he was appointed lecturer on manufacturing. He became a proponent of scientific management, and started working as business consultant.&lt;ref name="JAB 2004"/&gt; With the death of Taylor in 1914 Thompson became one of the best known speakers on Taylors methods.

In 1940 Thompson put an end to his business career, and started to study biochemistry at Harvard and Berkeley. Until his retirement he was researcher in cellular biochemistry at Berkeley. He died at the age of 87 in Montevideo, Uruguay.&lt;ref name="JAB 2004"/&gt;

'''Diocese  of Armavir''' ({{lang-hy|Արմավիրի թեմ}} ''Armaviri t'em''), is a diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] covering the [[Armavir Province]] of [[Armenia]]. The name is derived from the historic city of [[Armavir (ancient city)|Armavir]] which served as the capital of the ancient [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] between 331 and 210 BC. 

The diocese was officially founded on May 30, 1996, by Catholicos [[Karekin I]]. The seat of the diocese is the Cathedral of Saint Gregory of Narek in the town of [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://armaviritem.am/?page_id=7#.WSUj2bWTVBo|title=Արմավիրի թեմ|publisher=Diocese of Armavir}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Sion Adamyan is currently the primate of the diocese, serving since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://armaviritem.am/?page_id=9#.WSU2EbWTVBo Primates of Armavir Diocese]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Being home to many of the most important churches and monasteries of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the territory of Armavir has been the spiritual centre of the Armenian nation. Throughout the history, the territory has been regulated by several dioceses of the Armenian Church, including the diocese of Amberd, Hovhannavank and Bjni.

The territory remained an active religious centre of the Armenian church with the inauguration of many churches and monastic complexes during the medieval period. During the 7th century, the churches of [[Saint Hripsime Church|Saint Hripsime]], [[Saint Gayane Church|Saint Gayane]], [[Zvartnots Cathedral|Zvartnots]] and [[Targmanchats monastery, Aygeshat|Targmanchats]] were built.

After the independence of Armenia, the Diocese of Armavir was officially founded upon a ''[[kontakion]]'' issued by Catholicos [[Karekin I]] on May 30, 1996. The church of [[Holy Mother of God Church, Vagharshapat|Holy Mother of God]] in Vagharshapat has served as the seat of the diocese until 2014, when it was moved to the newly-built Saint Gregory of Narek Church in the town of Armavir.

Currently, the diocese has 26 churches under its jurisdiction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://armaviritem.am/?page_id=13#.WSUhcrWTVBo Churches of the Diocese of Armavir]&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]] and the churches of Hripsime, Gayane, [[Shoghakat Church|Shoghakat]], and [[Church of the Holy Archangels, Vagharshapat|the Holy Archangels]] are under the direct regulation of the [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin|Mother See]].

{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}

'''Earthseed''' is a [[religion]] based on the idea that "[[God]] is Change."  It is the creation of [[Octavia E. Butler]], as revealed by her character Lauren [[Oya]] Olamina in the books: ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'' and ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]''.  (A third book of the trilogy, ''Parable of the Trickster'', was not completed before Butler's death.)

== Background ==

''Parable of the Sower'' is a futuristic, dystopian, science-fiction novel.  In its reality, the United States has devolved into states and/or city-states warring for the few remaining resources.  Life is cheap, and the economy is becoming reborn as [[company towns]].

The main character in ''Parable of the Sower'', Lauren Olamina, is the daughter of a Baptist minister who serves their walled-in neighborhood.  Because of her mother's addiction to a prescription  drug, Olamina suffers from ''hyperempathy'', which causes her to share pain or perceived pain with any living creature she sees.  When her community is attacked, burned, and looted, seventeen-year-old Olamina barely escapes with her life.  She travels, at great danger, into northern California in search of a haven where she and others can build the first Earthseed community.

The beliefs of Earthseed are recorded in the fictional book ''Earthseed: The Books of the Living''.  Olamina "writes" in short, poetic passages.  Portions of this text are presented at the beginning of each section, some chapters, and occasionally throughout the text.  The philosophy of Earthseed also underlies the motivations of some of the characters in these novels.

== Central tenets ==

The word "Earthseed" comes from the idea that the seeds of all life on Earth can be transplanted, and through adaptation will grow, in many different types of situations or places.  "The Books of the Living" is chosen in direct contrast to many other religions' use of the phrase "The Books of the Dead".  Earthseed is a religion of the present and the future, of the living, not of the dead or the past.

Although Olamina is raised as a Baptist, she does not feel comfortable with "her father's God."  Instead, she develops ideas that seem to better fit the reality she knows.

Because "God is Change", humans are able to direct God's malleability. Believers are enjoined to "shape God".  By shaping themselves, they can save themselves.  Believers are to accept the central tenet that "God is Change" primarily so that they will recognize their own power to affect and direct Change/God.  Only by conscious effort can they avoid being God's victims.

Earthseed also promotes the belief that "The Destiny of Earthseed / '''Is''' to take root among the stars" (''The Parable of the Sower'', Octavia E. Butler).  The Destiny is necessary because, eventually, we will outgrow [[Earth]] (i.e., use up its natural resources).

The central verse of Earthseed is given in the following:

{{quote|
Consider:  Whether you're a human being, an insect, a microbe, or a stone, this verse is true.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;All that you touch
You Change.

All that you Change
Changes you.

The only lasting truth
Is Change.

God
Is Change.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|Octavia E. Butler|''Parable of the Sower''
}}

The central paradox of Earthseed is:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Why is the universe?
To shape God.

Why is God?
To shape the universe.&lt;/poem&gt;
|Octavia Butler|''Parable of the Sower''
}}

== Influence ==

While the religion began as fiction, it has inspired several real-world movements.

The [[Terasem Movement]] seeks the development of humanity through technology, and to bridge the gap between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/66536/terasem-trascendence-religion-technology/ |title=The Rapture of the Nerds|first=Jessica |last=Roy |work=Time |date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Terasem'' comes from the Latin ''[[wikt:Terra|Terra]]'' ('earth') and ''[[wikt:semen#Latin|sēmen]]'' ('seed').  Like the fictional Earthseed, Terasem Movement attempts to "shape God", but through technology.

There is also a [[Modern Paganism|humanistic pagan]] website called Earthseed, and a social movement named SolSeed.

'''Eli Jaxon-Bear''' (born Elliot J. Zeldow in 1947) is an American spiritual teacher and author.  He lives in [[Ashland, Oregon]] with his wife, fellow spiritual teacher [[Gangaji]].&lt;ref name="leelacommunity.org"&gt;[http://www.leelacommunity.org Leela Community with Eli&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Before he met his teacher, Sri [[H.W.L. Poonja]], in 1990, he was best known for his work on the spiritual dimension of the [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]].  Following his meeting with Poonjaji he continued to teach, carrying his teacher's message to the West.&lt;ref&gt;Wake Up and Roar: Satsang with H.W.L. Poonja, Editor (2002), ({{ISBN|978-0-963219-41-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jaxon-Bear was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He attended the [[University of Pittsburgh]], graduating in 1968. In 1965 he was part of a group of students who went to Montgomery, Alabama to take part in the civil rights marches.&lt;ref&gt;University of Pittsburgh Yearbook, 1965, page 91-93. Jaxon-Bear is shown boarding the bus with other students: http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittyearbooks;cc=pittyearbooks;idno=1965e49702;q1=Zeldow;node=1965e49702%3A12;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=97;page=root;size=s&lt;/ref&gt; Later he wrote of this experience, "Getting on the bus represented a much deeper commitment than simply enduring a few weeks of dangerous adventure. Finally, I had to give my life fully to getting on the bus for freedom without a thought of getting off." &lt;ref&gt;Sudden Awakening p11-13&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating he became a community organizer in Chicago and Detroit. Freedom of Information documents show that the FBI began a file on Jaxon-Bear after his arrest during the Democratic Convention in the summer of 1968.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, January 8, 1969 https://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch?query=Elliot+Zeldow&amp;more=date_all&lt;/ref&gt; After six months of working in a steel mill in Homestead, Pennsylvania, he was awarded a fellowship for a doctorate at the Graduate School for International Studies at the [[University of Denver]]. He was part of the student strike committee that shut down the university in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;University of Denver Magazine Summer 2009 http://blogs.du.edu/today/magazine/dus-woodstock-of-the-west&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual path==
Jaxon-Bear's eighteen-year spiritual path began after the [[1971 May Day Protests]], when he became a federal fugitive during the [[Vietnam War]]. As he described, "I was brought face-to-face with death. Through grace, I passed to the other side: I awoke to the truth of my own nature as empty, immortal consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Sudden Awakening, Preface, page xiii-xiv&lt;/ref&gt; This experience led him on a spiritual search that took him around the world and into many traditions and practices. In 1978, [[Kalu Rinpoche]] appointed him the president of Kagyu Minjur Choling, the first [[Kagyu]] Tibetan Buddhist dharma center in Marin County. In 1982, he was presented with a Zen Teaching Fan at Cho Sho-ji Zen Temple in Beppu, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Journal, January 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the 1980s, Jaxon-Bear ran a Clinical Hypnosis and Neurolinguistics certification program at the [[Esalen Institute]]. Also during that time, he studied the ancient Sufi wisdom teachings of the [[Enneagram of Personality|Enneagram]]. His first writings and teachings on the Enneagram emerged in 1989. He was a keynote speaker at the first International Enneagram Conference at Stanford University in August, 1994. His talk was entitled "The Enneagram and Self-Realization".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conferencerecording.com/conflists/enn94.htm Enneagram Conference&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 in India, Jaxon-Bear met the teacher Sri [[H.W.L. Poonja]], who is called "Papaji" by his followers. A few months later, he took his wife, Antoinette Varner, to meet Papaji. She too became a devotee and Papaji named her [[Gangaji]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gangaji.org Gangaji&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent to the meeting with Papaji, both Jaxon-Bear and Gangaji were allowed to teach satsang in the West, and given conditional permission to publish ''Wake Up and Roar''.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated September 28, 1992 in which Papaji asked Jaxon-Bear to hold [[Satsang]] in the USA http://www.leelacommunity.org/eli-jaxon-bear/lineage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core teaching==
Jaxon-Bear's teaching focuses on the nature of egoic suffering in support of self-realization.  Today, Jaxon-Bear offers the living transmission of silence received from his teacher Papaji. He also helps students address egoic identification using the Enneagram as a vehicle for self-inquiry and realization of true freedom. What Papaji called "stopping the mind," Jaxon-Bear called "ending the fixation." He wrote, "The great gift of the Enneagram is that it describes who you are not. It shows the veiling of pure, pristine consciousness by habits of egoic identification."&lt;ref&gt;''From Fixation to Freedom: The Enneagram of Liberation'' Intro, page xii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and publications==
In 1990, Jaxon-Bear established the Pacific Center Press to publish books and videos. Volume One of ''Wake Up and Roar'', a compilation of spiritual dialogues with Papaji edited by Jaxon-Bear, was published in 1992. The second volume of ''Wake Up and Roar'' followed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;''Wake Up and Roar: Satsang with H.W.L. Poonja'', Editor (2002), ({{ISBN|978-0-963219-41-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, he wrote ''From Fixation to Freedom: The Enneagram of Liberation''&lt;ref&gt;''From Fixation to Freedom: The Enneagram of Liberation'' (2006), ({{ISBN|978-1-893840-26-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; to reflect the evolution of his teaching of the Enneagram in light of his teacher's transmission.

In 2004, Jaxon-Bear wrote ''Sudden Awakening Into Direct Realization''. "In this book, I offer you the gift of awakening that was given to me by my teacher, Sri H.W. L. Poonja, a fully awakened satguru called Papaji. Awakening is real: it is actually the only reality. Awakening is permanent: it doesn't come and go."&lt;ref&gt;Sudden Awakening, Preface, page XV&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, a new edition of Wake Up and Roar: Satsang with Papaji was released by New Morning Books.

In 2018, An Outlaw Makes It Home: The Awakening of a Spiritual Revolutionary was released by New Morning Books.

==Leela Foundation==
Jaxon-Bear established the Leela Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The organization offers events, books, videos, audios, and outreach programs dedicated to world peace and freedom through universal self-realization.&lt;ref name="leelacommunity.org"/&gt; Jaxon-Bear holds public meetings and retreats in the US, Europe and Australia.

==Personal life==
In 1975, Jaxon-Bear met his life-partner, Antoinette Roberson Varner (born Merle Antoinette ("Toni") Roberson) in [[Berkeley, California]]. They spent their first five years together living on a small farm in [[Bolinas, California]]. In 1989, they were married in a cave in [[Haleakala Crater]] on [[Maui]].

===Affair===
In October 2005, Jaxon-Bear admitted to his wife Gangaji that he had recently ended a three-year affair with an adult female student who was at the time employed as the executive director of his organization, the Leela Foundation. After a brief separation, Jaxon-Bear and Gangaji reconciled in December 2005. In October 2006, he disclosed the extramarital relationship to the Gangaji Foundation board of directors and staff. Subsequently the executive director and board of foundation issued an open letter stating, "What was initially seen as a matter between two adults is now recognized to be a betrayal of the teacher/student relationship and an abuse of power".&lt;ref name="Denempont"/&gt; The letter added: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The repercussions of this betrayal are reverberating in ways that were never imagined, but are very painful. The deepest truths do not excuse or justify our failures and betrayals as human beings. Gratefully though, without minimizing or spiritualizing the damage done, love remains and sustains all. It is only in love that we can truly meet the pain that comes with being human. Ever more so, we can commit ourselves to the compassion that love provides and to tell the truth more clearly and honestly to others and ourselves.&lt;ref name="Denempont"&gt;Denempont, Barbara. [http://gangaji.tribe.net/tribe/servlet/m/thread/e7b6401a-94e3-4f1c-89f2-9a5b18512aa0?tribeId=efb66575-a3a8-49e8-aa9a-b2392e13294c&amp;threadid=e7b6401a-94e3-4f1c-89f2-9a5b18512aa0&amp; Letter from Boards of Leela &amp; Gangaji Foundations], The Gangaji Foundation, October 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the disclosure, Jaxon-Bear publicly apologized for the pain he had caused his wife, the woman he became involved with, and his community. At that time, Jaxon-Bear resigned from teaching. He and Gangaji held open meetings to heal the wounds experienced in their spiritual community, as well as holding retreats on the subjects of disillusionment, betrayal and relationship.

Subsequently, in an interview with Bertrand Coquoz of ''Wegweiser Magazin'' in Germany, Jaxon-Bear said of his affair, "My worst mistake thus far in this flawed life was allowing myself to be in an intimate relationship with two women at the same time. They were the two loves of my life and they both loved me deeply and truly. But it was an impossible situation for all three of us. I caused suffering to the two people that I loved most deeply. That first mistake led to my lying about my affair. This was a great mistake. I had never lied to my partner over our thirty years together and it was a terrible mistake. It was shocking to see that I was capable of this. Bearing having caused suffering and falling into the trap of lying was the greatest pain that I have ever experienced in my life. It burned a holy fire in a place that had not yet burned. As I tried to satisfy my obligations to both my partner and my lover I continued to make many mistakes."&lt;ref&gt;"Heilige Vollkommenheit und menschliche Irrtümer" Wegweiser Magazin (http://www.wegweiser-magazin.de/Archiv/01-09/aktuellesmagazin/artikel/artikel1.html), translated as "Saints, Sinners and Self-Realization", http://www.leelacommunity.org/library/interviews-and-articles-/saints-sinners-and-self-realization.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness===
In 2007, after suffering severe bone pain, Jaxon-Bear was diagnosed with last stage [[multiple myeloma]], a severe form of blood cancer that attacks the bones. He underwent surgery for multiple fractures of his spine and participated in an experimental treatment protocol that included tandem stem cell transplants at the Myeloma Institute in Little Rock, Arkansas. He continues with maintenance level chemotherapy. In January 2008, Jaxon-Bear reestablished the Leela Foundation and returned to teaching.&lt;ref name="leelacommunity.org"/&gt;

'''Eparchy''' is an [[anglicize]]d [[Greek language|Greek]] word ({{lang|grc|[[Wiktionary:επαρχία|ἐπαρχία]]}}), authentically [[Latinization (literature)|Latinized]] as '''''eparchia''''', which can be loosely translated as the rule or [[ecclesiastical jurisdiction|jurisdiction]] over something, such as a province, prefecture, or territory.  It has specific meanings both in politics, history and in the hierarchy of the [[Eastern Churches|Eastern Christian]] churches.

'''In secular use''', the word eparchy denotes an administrative district in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] / [[Byzantine Empire]], or in modern [[Greece]] or [[Cyprus]].

'''In ecclesiastical use''', an eparchy is a territorial [[diocese]] governed by a [[bishop]] of one of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]], who holds the title of eparch. It is part of a [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]].  Each eparchy is divided into [[parish]]es in the same manner as a diocese of western Christendom.  In the [[Catholic Church]], an archieparchy equivalent to an [[archdiocese]] of the [[Roman Rite]] and its [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] is an archieparch, equivalent to an archbishop of the Roman Rite.

==Secular jurisdictions==
=== Imperial Roman administration ===
{{see|Roman province}}
Originally '''eparchy''' (ἐπαρχίᾱ, ''eparchia'') was the Greek equivalent of the Latin term ''[[provincia]]'', one of the districts of the [[Roman Empire]]. As such it was used, chiefly in the eastern parts of the Empire, to designate the [[Roman province]]s. The term '''eparch''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|ἔπαρχος}}}}, ''eparchos'') however, designating an eparchy's governor, was most usually used to refer to the [[praetorian prefect]]s (singular in Greek: {{lang|grc|ἔπαρχος τοῦ πραιτωρίου}}, "eparch of the praetorium") in charge of the Empire's [[praetorian prefecture]]s, and to the [[Eparch of Constantinople]], the city's urban prefect. 

====Byzantine administration====
The [[Dominate]]-period administrative system was retained In the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] of the Empire until the 7th century. As Greek became the Empire's main administrative language, replacing Latin, in the latter 6th century even the provinces of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], in reconquered [[Italy]], were termed ''eparchiae'' in Greek as well as in Latin.

In the latter half of the 7th century, the old provincial administration was replaced by the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|thematic system]]. Even after that however, the term ''eparchos'' remained in use until the 840s for the senior administrative official of each ''thema'', under the governing ''[[strategos]]''. Thereafter, eparchs are evident in some cases as city governors, but the most important by far amongst them was the [[Eparch of Constantinople]], whose office had wide-ranging powers and functioned continuously until the 13th century.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956}}

===Modern Greece and Cyprus===
{{details|Provinces of Greece}}
The term ''eparchia'' was revived as one of the administrative sub-provincial units of post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] independent [[Greece]], the country being divided into [[prefectures of Greece|''nomoi'']] ("Prefectures"), of which in turn some were subdivided into ''eparchies''. From 1887, the ''eparchies'' were abolished as actual administrative units, but were retained for some state services, especially finance services and education, as well as for electoral purposes. Before the [[Second World War]], there were 139 ''eparchies'', and after the war, with the addition of the [[Dodecanese]] Islands, their number grew to 147. The provinces were abolished in the mainland (but retained for the islands), in the wide-ranging administrative reform implemented in 1997 (the "Kapodistrias Project") and replaced by enlarged [[Municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (''demoi'').

In [[Cyprus]], the term ''eparchia'' is used to refer to the [[Districts of Cyprus]].

==Church hierarchy==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] --&gt;
{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}
The [[Christian Church]] (before the split into [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]]) adopted elements of political, administrative system of the late [[Roman Empire]], as introduced by the reforms of [[Diocletian]] (284-305). Adopted elements included both organizational structure and terminology.

Notwithstanding the primacies of the [[Apostolic See]]s of [[Pope|Rome]], [[Patriarch of Alexandria|Alexandria]] and [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]], the bishoprics of each civil province were grouped in one [[ecclesiastical province]], also called eparchy, under the supervision of the [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], usually the bishop of the provincial capital. The [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 accepted this arrangement and orders that: "the authority [of appointing bishops] shall belong to the metropolitan in each eparchy" (can. iv), i.e., in each such civil eparchy (province) there shall be a metropolitan bishop who has authority over the others.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989}}

Since the use of the term eparchy was originally linked to metropolitan rights, later in [[Eastern Christianity]], after a process of [[Job title inflation|title-inflation]] and multiplying the numbers of metropolitans by elevating local bishops to honorary metropolitan rank without giving them any real metropolitan powers, the use of the word "eparchy" was gradually modified and came to refer to [[diocese]]s of such "metropolitan" bishops, and later to dioceses in general. This process was initially promoted in the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], and later the new usage of term "eparchy" became prevalent in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the ancient [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Churches]], and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the name eparchy is not commonly used as the usual term for a diocese except in the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian]], [[Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church|Czechoslovak]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]], and [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]] Orthodox Churches. The Russian Orthodox Church in the early 20th century counted 86 eparchies, of which three ([[Kiev]], [[Moscow]], and [[St. Petersburg]]) were ruled by bishops who always bore the title "Metropolitan."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

'''Erich Šlomović''' ({{lang-sr-Latn|Erih Šlomović}}, also known as '''Erich Chlomovitch''') (1915–1942) was a [[Jewish]] art collector in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Defined as such in a Dutch source in English: http://www.garyschwartzarthistorian.nl/schwartzlist/?id=66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In French rendered as "juif yougoslave": http://www.artcult.fr/_Judaica/Fiche/Art-0-1249411.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was an assistant and protégé of [[Ambroise Vollard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/kontroverzna-diplomatska-po%C5%A1iljka-s-ciljem-beograd/a-5745327|title=Kontroverzna diplomatska pošiljka s ciljem - Beograd|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2010-06-30|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Šlomović was born in [[Đakovo]] ([[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) in 1915 to a [[Jew]]ish family of Bernard and Roza Šlomović. He had a brother, Egon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D’Arcy|first=David|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/darcy/darcy1-10-07.asp|title=The Mysterious Mr. Slomovic|work=[[artnet]]|quote=|date=|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hakol"&gt;{{hr icon}} Ha-Kol (Glasilo Židovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Vesna Domany Hardy; ''O zbirci Ericha Šlomovića''; stranica 43, 44, 45, 46; broj 103, siječanj / veljača 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/slike-koje-je-1939--hrvat-spasio-od-hitlera-idu-na-najvecu-aukciju-godine/737775/|title=Slike koje je 1939.

== Career ==
In the 1930s, Šlomović moved to Paris, where he was befriended by legendary art collector [[Ambroise Vollard]].  Through Vollard, Šlomović met the greatest artists of the age, including Picasso, Matisse, Cocteau, Rouault among others, and was able to amass an impressive personal collection of some 600 works.  Vollard died in a car accident in July 1939.  Shortly after that, with France on the brink of Nazi invasion, Šlomović decided to return to Yugoslavia, where the war had not yet spread. He left about 200 artworks in a vault in the Société Générale in Paris, and the rest he had shipped via diplomatic pouch to Belgrade.  These were exhibited at a highly acclaimed exhibition in Zagreb in 1940.&lt;ref name="hakol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Collection Erich Chlomovitch" Musee National de Belgrade, published by Muzejsko - galerijski centar, Zagreb, Croatia, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
During [[World War II]], with the [[Independent State of Croatia]] establishment in 1941, Šlomović and his family moved to [[Bačina]] in [[Serbia]] in an attempt to save themselves.&lt;ref name="hakol"/&gt;
While in Bačina, Šlomović hid the paintings he brought with him.&lt;ref name="hakol"/&gt; Later, as a part of the German reprisals of 100 Serbian men shot for every German soldier killed, Bernard, Erich and Egon were taken to detention camp in [[Ćuprija]]. Soon after, they were all killed. Erich's mother Rosa and female cousin Mara were not touched and neither was his collection. They both survived the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] hidden by the local population.&lt;ref name="hakol" /&gt;

==Legacy==
After his death, Šlomović mother donated his collection to the [[National Museum of Serbia]]. In 1989 [[Veljko Bulajić]] directed ''[[Donator]]'', a movie dedicated to Šlomović's tragic life while in 2004 [[Momo Kapor]] wrote a book about his life. The paintings in the Société Generale bank were discovered in 1979 when the bank was allowed to open the vault to recover unpaid storage fees. There is a legal dispute over the ownership of those paintings.&lt;ref name="hakol"/&gt;

'''''Ezekiel's Vision''''' is a c. 1518 painting by [[Raphael]] showing the prophet [[Ezekiel]]'s [[Merkabah|vision of God in majesty]]. It is housed in the Palatine Gallery of [[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], central Italy.

==History==
The work is remembered by Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] as property of a [[Bologna|Bolognese]] nobleman, Vincenzo Ercolani. There is trace of payment by him to Raphael for 8 [[ducat (Italian coin)|ducats]] in 1510, but this is generally considered just a down payment, since stylistically the work (inspired for example by [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]) cannot be dated before 1518.

In Florence since as early as 1589, it was ceded to [[Francesco I de' Medici]] and was placed at the [[Uffizi]]. The painting is known to be at Palazzo Pitti in 1697. In 1799 it was robbed by the French, who kept it in Paris until returning it back in 1816.

The work was once considered to be by the hand of [[Giulio Romano]], with Raphael providing only the drawing. However, it has been subsequently assigned to Raphael.

'''Haḍḍa''' ({{lang-ps|هډه}}) is a [[Greco-Buddhist]] archeological site located in the ancient region of [[Gandhara]], ten kilometers south of the city of [[Jalalabad]], in the [[Nangarhar Province]] of eastern [[Afghanistan]].

==Background==
Some 23,000 Greco-Buddhist sculptures, both clay and plaster, were excavated in Hadda during the 1930s and the 1970s. The findings combine elements of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]] in an almost perfect Hellenistic style.

[[Image:HaddaBodhisattva.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Bodhisattva]] and [[Chandeka]], Hadda, 5th century CE]]
{{History of Afghanistan}}
Although the style of the artifacts is typical of the late Hellenistic 2nd or 1st century BCE, the Hadda sculptures are usually dated (although with some uncertainty), to the 1st century CE or later (i.e. one or two centuries afterward). This discrepancy might be explained by a preservation of late Hellenistic styles for a few centuries in this part of the world.  However it is possible that the artifacts actually were produced in the late Hellenistic period.

Given the antiquity of these sculptures and a technical refinement indicative of artists fully conversant with all the aspects of Greek sculpture, it has been suggested that Greek communities were directly involved in these realizations, and that "the area might be the cradle of incipient Buddhist sculpture in [[Indo-Greek]] style".&lt;ref&gt;John Boardman, ''The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity'' ({{ISBN|0-691-03680-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of many of the works at Hadda is highly Hellenistic, and can be compared to sculptures found at the [[Bassae|Temple of Apollo in Bassae, Greece]].

The [[toponym]] Hadda has its origins in [[Sanskrit]] haḍḍa n. m., "a bone", or, an unrecorded *haḍḍaka, adj., "(place) of bones". The former - if not a fossilized form - would have given rise to a Haḍḍ in the subsequent vernaculars of northern India (and in the [[Old Indic]] loans in modern Pashto). The latter would have given rise to the form ''Haḍḍa'' naturally and would well reflect the belief that Hadda housed a bone-relic of Buddha. The term haḍḍa is found as a loan in [[Pashto language|Pashto]] haḍḍ, n., id. and may reflect the linguistic influence of the original pre-Islamic population of the area.

==Works of art==
A sculptural group excavated at the Hadda site of Tapa-i-Shotor represents [[Buddha]] surrounded by perfectly Hellenistic [[Herakles]] and [[Tyche]] holding a [[cornucopia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg See image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731041835/www.fao.org/afghanistan/Data/Mapsystem/Archeological_Sites/html/img/19.jpg |date=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only adaptation of the Greek iconography is that Herakles holds the thunderbolt of [[Vajrapani]] rather than his usual club.

Other attendants to the Buddha have been excavated which display manifest Hellenistic styles, such as the "Genie au Fleur", today in Paris at the [[Guimet Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1906/19060665.jpg See image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130103001644/www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1906/19060665.jpg |date=2013-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist scriptures==
It is believed the oldest surviving Buddhist manuscripts-indeed the oldest surviving Indian manuscripts of any kind-were recovered around Hadda. Probably dating from around the 1st century CE, they were written on bark in [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]] using the [[Kharoṣṭhī]] script, and were unearthed in a clay pot bearing an inscription in the same language and script. They are part of the long-lost canon of the [[Sarvastivadin]] Sect that dominated [[Gandhara]] and was instrumental in Buddhism's spread into central and east Asia via the [[Silk Road]]. The manuscripts are now in the possession of the [[British Library]].

==Destruction==
Hadda is said to have been almost entirely destroyed in the fighting during the civil war in [[Afghanistan]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
There were also many works of art lost as a result of the civil war. One of the worst of the casualties was the loss of two statues. The Red Mountain range in Bamiyan that once housed two giant statues of the Buddha, on cliff faces, besides smaller structures of archaeological significance. The two big statues, dating back to the 5th or 6th century CE, were the largest of all Buddhist statues so far attested in the world. Only remnants of these statues were left behind.

The '''history of Dianetics''' possibly begins in the 1920s. Its originator [[L. Ron Hubbard]] claimed that his ideas of [[Dianetics]] originated in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account, he spent a great deal of time in the [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's]] library, where he would have encountered the work of Freud and other [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]]. In April 1950, Hubbard and several others established the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related for the forthcoming publication. Hubbard first introduced Dianetics to the public in the article ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]'' published in the May 1950 issue of the magazine ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref name="Creation"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | title = The Creation of 'Religious' Scientology | publisher = Religious Studies and Theology | accessdate = 2006-05-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070312004725/http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/creation.htm?FACTNet#txtref02 | archivedate = 2007-03-12 | df =  }} Originally published by Stephen A. Kent in December, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard wrote ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;"L.R.H. Biography," Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, 31 October 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of selling ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' brought in a flood of money, which Hubbard used to establish Dianetics foundations in six major American cities. The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, viewing it with bemusement, concern, or outright derision. Complaints were made against local Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation.

Hubbard explained the backlash as a response from various entities trying to co-opt Dianetics for their own use. Hubbard blamed the hostile press coverage in particular on a plot by the [[American Communist Party]]. In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as he believed it secretly controlled most of the world's governments.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Ron's Journal 67," taped message of 20 September 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

By the autumn of 1950, financial problems had developed, and by November 1950, the six Foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Dianetics and the Professions'', A.E. van Vogt, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation's work, and relations between the board members became strained, with several leaving, even to support causes critical of Dianetics. One example was [[Harvey Jackins]], founder of [[Re-evaluation Counseling#Origins of RC as an adaptation of Dianetics|Re-evaluation Counselling]], originally a sort of discrete reworking of Dianetics, which L Ron Hubbard later declared [[Suppressive Person|suppressive]] to Scientology.

In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation'', Elizabeth, NJ. January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation closed its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts. Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from [[Wichita, Kansas]], offered a brief respite from bankruptcy, but the Foundation's finances failed again in 1952.&lt;ref name="barefaced"&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard | publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co | location=New York | edition=First American | year=1987 | isbn=0-8050-0654-0 | pages = 305–306 | url = http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfmconte.htm |chapter=11. Bankrolling and Bankruptcy | chapterurl=http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfm11.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a sale of assets resulting from the bankruptcy, Hubbard no longer owned the rights to the name "Dianetics",&lt;ref name="barefaced"/&gt; but its philosophical framework still provided the seed for [[Scientology]] to grow. Scientologists refer to the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' as "Book One." In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as "Scientology, a religious philosophy." Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas. Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his [[reactive mind]] [[engram (Dianetics)|engrams]], the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential.

In 1978, Hubbard released ''New Era Dianetics'' (NED), a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time. The course consists of 11 [[rundown (Scientology)|rundowns]] and requires a specifically trained auditor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.auditing.org/13-ned.htm| title=New Era Dianetics Auditing| accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run (processed) exactly like Standard Dianetics (once very widely practiced before the advent of NED) except the pre-clear (parishioner) is encouraged to find the "postulate" he made as a result of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;L. Ron Hubbard ''New Era Dianetics Series 7RA'', HCOB 28 June 1978RA revised 15 September 1978, Hubbard Communications Office (HCO).&lt;/ref&gt;  ("Postulate" in Dianetics and Scientology has the meaning of "a conclusion, decision or resolution made by the individual himself; to conclude, decide or resolve a problem or to set a pattern for the future or to nullify a pattern of the past"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientology.ie/p_jpg/wis/wiseng/gloss.htm#p |title=The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary |publisher=Scientology.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428234523/http://www.scientology.ie/p_jpg/wis/wiseng/gloss.htm#p |archivedate=2009-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to its conventional meanings.)

==Origins==
{{see also|Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)}}
The ideas of [[Dianetics]] originated in unpublished research [[L. Ron Hubbard]] supposedly performed in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foundingchurch.scientology.org/dc15.htm |title=The History of Dianetics and Scientology in Washington, DC |accessdate=2007-01-23 | publisher = Church of Scientology International}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1930s. He recorded the results and his conclusions in an unpublished 1938 manuscript, ''[[Excalibur (L. Ron Hubbard)|Excalibur]]'', the contents of which formed the basis for some of his later publications.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "The Anatomy Of Thought". Hubbard Communication Office Policy Letter 26 April 1970R, revised 15 March 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hubbard's service in the [[United States Navy]] during World War II, he was admitted to the [[Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]] in [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientology.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/founder/pg018.html | title=Early Clinical Research | first=L.

==The emergence of Dianetics==

In January 1949, Hubbard informed his literary agent, [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], that he was writing a book on the "cause and cure of nervous tension", which he was going to call either ''The Dark Sword'' or ''Excalibur'' or ''Science of the Mind'', and assured Ackerman that the book had "more selling and publicity angles than any book of which I have ever heard." In the same month, he told ''Writers' Markets and Methods'' magazine that he was working on a "book of psychology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard | publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co | location=New York | edition=First American | year=1987 | isbn=0-8050-0654-0 | page = 144 | url = http://www.religio.de/books/bfm/bfmconte.html |chapter=8. The Mystery Of The Missing Research | chapterurl=http://www.religio.de/books/bfm/bfm08.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1949, Hubbard told the Gerontological Society at Baltimore City Hospital that he was preparing a paper with the somewhat unwieldy title of ''Certain Discoveries and Researches Leading to the Removal of Early Traumatic Experiences Including Attempted Abortion, Birth Shock and Infant Illnesses and Accidents with an Examination of their Effects Physiological and Psychological and their Potential Influence on Longevity on the Adult Individual with an Account of the Techniques Evolved and Employed.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dianetics.lronhubbard.org/page14.htm "Letters from the Birth of Dianetics - L. Ron Hubbard - The Dianetics Letters"], Church of Scientology International.&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's letter was "politely received", but the Society apparently declined involvement. He also wrote to the [[American Medical Association]] and the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/page14.htm "Ron the Philosopher: The Birth of Dianetics"], Church of Scientology International&lt;/ref&gt; These letters, and their responses, have not been published, though Hubbard later said that they had been negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=L. Ron | last= Hubbard | url=http://www.ronthephilosopher.org/page75.htm | title=My Only Defense For Having Lived | year = 1966 | publisher=Church of Scientology International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Hubbard told his friend [[John W. Campbell]], the editor of [[Astounding Magazine|''Astounding Science Fiction'' magazine]] and publisher of many of Hubbard's short stories, about his work. Campbell had been one of Hubbard's early test subjects and believed that Hubbard's techniques had cured his persistent [[sinusitis]], so he was an enthusiastic supporter. In a letter to one of ''Astounding's'' contributors, Jack Williamson, he wrote: "I know dianetics is one of, if not the greatest, discovery of all Man's written and unwritten history. It produces the sort of stability and sanity men have dreamed about for centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Jack Williamson, ''Wonder's Child: my life in science fiction''. Bluejay Books, New York (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1949, Campbell wrote to another contributor, [[Joseph A. Winter]], a physician from [[Michigan]]. Winter was intrigued by Campbell's claims about Hubbard's work, but initially skeptical; Hubbard sent him what he called "an operator's manual for your use" which convinced Winter that Dianetics had some promise. Winter later wrote:

:With cooperation from some institutions, some psychiatrists, he {{interp|Hubbard}} has worked on all types of cases. Institutionalized schizophrenics, apathies, manics, depressives, perverts, stuttering, neuroses - in all, nearly 1000 cases. But just a brief sampling of each type; he doesn't have proper statistics in the usual sense. But he has one statistic. He has cured every patient he worked with. He has cured ulcers, arthritis, asthma.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1949, Winter, Hubbard, and Campbell met at Hubbard's home in [[Bay Head, New Jersey]] to continue work. Winter attempted to interest some medical colleagues and psychiatrists in Dianetics, with little success, and suggested to Hubbard that he publish an article to stimulate interest in his work. Perhaps mindful of the rejection of his earlier efforts, Hubbard told Winter that "the articles you suggest would be more acceptable coming from another pen than mine."&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, in late 1949, Winter wrote a paper "giving a brief resumé of the principles and methodology of dianetic therapy" which he submitted informally to an editor of the ''Journal of the American Medical Association''. However, the editor told Winter that "the paper as written did not contain sufficient evidence of efficacy to be acceptable and was, moreover, better suited to one of the journals which dealt with psychotherapy." He revised the paper, added case histories provided by Hubbard, and submitted it to the ''American Journal of Psychiatry'', which rejected it on the same grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Church of Scientology, Hubbard issued his early research in the form of a manuscript entitled ''Dianetics: The Original Thesis'' in 1948; Hubbard gives the year as 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Dianetics: its background". HCO Bulletin of May 22, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Auditor attitude and the bank", lecture of October 10, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; It received a wider public release in 1951 and is now published as the book ''The Dynamics of Life''. The original text is not available for comparison with the 1951 publication, but it may have comprised the "operator's manual" written by Hubbard for Winter, which is the first independently attested codification of Dianetics.

At the end of 1949, Hubbard and Campbell agreed to announce Dianetics in the upcoming May issue of ''Astounding'', to be followed by a full-length book.  Campbell arranged for Hermitage House, a small [[New York City]] medical and psychiatric textbook publisher, to publish the book. Hubbard also published an article in ''The Explorers Journal'' called "Terra Incognita: The Mind."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ "Terra Incognita: The Mind"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204155459/http://www.dianetics.org/en_US/l-ron-hubbard/articles/terra/ |date=2006-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dianetics was not quite finished at this stage; engrams were called ''comanomes'', a [[neologism]] proposed by Winter that was later abandoned.

In April 1950, Hubbard, Campbell, Winter and several others established a Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]] to coordinate work related to the forthcoming publication. Hubbard wrote ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' at that time, allegedly completing the 180,000-word book in six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;"L.R.H. Biography", Sea Org Flag Information Letter 67, October 31, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This work was published on 9 May 1950 and quickly sold out its first run of 8,000 copies. Only two months after the book's publication, ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that over 55,000 copies had been sold and enthusiasts had established 500 Dianetics clubs across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"BOOKS Industry: Best Seller", ''Newsweek'', No. 36, August 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In July, [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] reported that it was climbing the U.S. bestseller lists.&lt;ref name=TwoMinds&gt;{{cite web | title = Of Two Minds | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,812852,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1950-07-24 | accessdate = 2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell reported in the August 1950 ''Astounding'' that the magazine was receiving up to a thousand letters a week about Dianetics. Sales reached 150,000 copies by the end of the year.

Campbell's endorsement had proven invaluable; ''Astounding Science Fiction'' had over 150,000 readers, many of whom were familiar with Hubbard's [[science fiction]] and had a strong interest in new scientific discoveries. Among the wider population, Dianetics gained popularity as a cheaper, simpler and apparently more effective means of self-improvement than conventional psychotherapies. Hubbard's optimistic view that Dianetics could alleviate the Cold War climate of tension and fear also struck a chord. One of his supporters, [[Frederick L. Schuman]], wrote in a letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'' that "History has become a race between Dianetics and catastrophe".

The success of Dianetics brought in a flood of money. Hubbard offered teaching courses for Dianetic "auditors" through the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, costing $500 per person for four to six weeks of instruction and thirty-six hours of Dianetic therapy. Hubbard recruited his friend and fellow science fiction writer [[A. E. van Vogt]] to act as the Foundation's treasurer, and five other Foundations were soon established in [[Washington, DC]], [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], [[Los Angeles]] and [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dianetics: Science or Hoax?", ''Look'', December 5, 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation's Los Angeles property alone was valued at $4.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Russell | authorlink=Russell Miller| title=Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L.

==Opposition to Dianetics==

The scientific and medical communities were far less enthusiastic about Dianetics, viewing it with bemusement, concern, or outright derision.  Nobel Prize–winning physicist [[Isidor Isaac Rabi|I.I. Rabi]], reviewing ''Dianetics'' for ''[[Scientific American]]'', declared that "this volume probably contains more promises and less evidence per page than has any publication since the invention of printing." He noted that the publication of ''Dianetics'' had coincided with that of ''[[Worlds in Collision]]'', a notorious work of pseudoscience by [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], with which ''Dianetics'' shared the top of the best-seller lists. This, Rabi said, illustrated "the most frightening proof of the confusion of the contemporary mind and its tendency to fall prey to pseudo-scientific concepts."&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Isidor Rabi, Review of Dianetics, ''Scientific American'', January 1951&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Nation'' pointed out the lack of documentation in ''Dianetics'': "No case histories are offered to substantiate his claims, nor is there documentation of any kind to indicate that any previous thinker, medical or otherwise, ever made a significant contribution to the subject of human behavior." The ''Individual Psychology Bulletin'' also criticized Hubbard for "not offer{{interp|ing}} any other evidence than a vague reference to hundreds of cured patients, without furnishing case histories or other specific data. The book is crammed with bragging and swaggering, pseudoscientific bombast, platitudes and vulgarities, and a great deal of sheer nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Deutsch, ''Individual Psychology Bulletin'', 9:1 (1951) p.38-9&lt;/ref&gt; British health minister [[Kenneth Robinson]], among others, expressed concern at the possible dangers of unskilled amateurs practicing therapy on patients, and skepticism about Hubbard's claims that Dianetics could be effective in dealing with illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atack|first1=Jon|title=A Piece of Blue Sky|date=August 19, 1990|publisher=Lyle Stuart Books, Carol Publishing Group|isbn=0-8184-0499-X|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1950, the [[American Psychological Association]] issued a resolution calling on psychologists not to use Hubbard's methods for treatment purposes unless and until they had been shown effective through scientific testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/about/division/cpmscientific.html#4 "M. Scientific Affairs - IV. DIANETICS"], ''APA Council Policy Manual'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints were made against local Dianetics practitioners for allegedly practicing medicine without a license. This eventually prompted Dianetics advocates to disclaim any medicinal benefits in order to avoid regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lebron|first1=Robyn|title=Searching for Spiritual Unity...can There be Common Ground?|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard explained the backlash as a response from various entities trying to co-opt Dianetics for their own use. He claimed that "just about the time {{interp|Dianetics}} hit the stands" (i.e. April–May 1950), a "very high-ranking officer" of the US Navy had approached him to sound him out about "using what you know about the mind to make people more suggestible." Hubbard apparently avoided this by resigning from the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "The National Academy of American Psychology", lecture of 31 December 1957&lt;/ref&gt; He also told the FBI in a 1952 interview that "the Soviets apparently realized the value of Dianetics because as early as 1938 an official of [[Amtorg]] {{interp|the Soviet trade organization}}, while at The Explorers Club in New York, contacted him to suggest that he go to Russia and develop Dianetics there." The FBI agent conducting the interview was not convinced, describing Hubbard as "a mental case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Russell|title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard|date=October 26, 1987|publisher=Michael Joseph Ltd|isbn=978-0718127640|page=181|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf/miller/bfm.txt.gz|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard blamed the hostile press coverage in particular on a plot by the [[American Communist Party]], working through the Authors League of America. According to Hubbard,

:These people in the early days of Dianetics said, "We can use Dianetics." They were all my friends. Everywhere I looked, every writer I knew who had ever been a member of the Communist Party was right there alongside of me pumping my hand, saying, "Good going, Ron. We knew you had it in you." ... And when they finally got it through their thick skulls in October 1950 that I didn't care to have Dianetics and Scientology covertly used by any other organization on Earth for their own special purposes, Dianetics and Scientology in the public presses had it.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Final Lecture", lecture of November 8, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Hubbard decided that the psychiatric profession was the origin of all of the criticism of Dianetics, as he believed it secretly controlled most of the world's governments.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Ron's Journal 67", taped message of September 20, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Current church head [[David Miscavige]] has also propagated this theory:

:At stake were all of {{interp|psychiatrists'}} vested interest dollars. How could they get research grants? Millions, or even billions - if the problems of the mind were already solved? And how could they hide the fact of LRH's discoveries if the whole country was talking about them? Their initial attacks have been mentioned over the years by us. First they got "technical reviews" by psychiatrists hatcheting Dianetics. They published these critical reviews in their psychiatric trade magazines ... Then they took these published reviews and handed them out to the press where they were promptly requoted as authority in magazines like "Slime" and "Tripe" {{interp|i.e. ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' and ''[[Life magazine|Life]]''}}.&lt;ref&gt;David Miscavige, speech to the [[International Association of Scientologists]], October 8, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fragmentation and transformation==

By the autumn of 1950, financial problems had developed. Book sales, lectures and auditor training still generated revenue, but financial controls were lax; Hubbard described the situation as "something on the accounting system of dumping it all in a barrel outside the door and hauling the barrel down to a bank every once in a while..."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Review of progress of Dianetics and dianetic business", lecture of 25 February 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's treasurer, A. E. van Vogt, said that Hubbard personally withdrew large sums from Foundation accounts, apparently without any prior notice or explanation of his purpose;&lt;ref&gt;A.E. van Vogt interview with Russell Miller, quoted in Miller, ''Bare Faced Messiah'' p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; van Vogt calculated that, by November 1950 the six Foundations had spent around one million dollars and were more than $200,000 in debt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Matters were not improved by Hubbard's experiments with a cocktail of [[benzedrine]], [[vitamins]] and [[glutamic acid]], called GUK after the rifle cleaning fluid used by the [[US Marine Corps]], which he believed would provide a chemical alternative to auditing.&lt;ref name=Departure&gt;{{cite web | title = Departure in Dianetics | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821638,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] | date = 1951-09-03 | accessdate = 2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forrest Ackerman interview with Russell Miller, quoted in Miller, ''Bare Faced Messiah'' p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation purchased a 110-room building in Los Angeles for the project, but Winter writes that it proved a "dismal, expensive failure."&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'' p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Disagreements emerged over the direction of the Dianetic Foundation's work, and relations between the board members became strained. Hubbard's interest in [[past lives]] was a particular cause of tension, as he noted in his 1951 book ''[[Science of Survival]]'':

:The subject of past deaths and past lives is so full of tension that as early as last July (1950-Ed) the board of trustees of the Foundation sought to pass a resolution banning the entire subject. And I have been many times requested to omit any reference to these in the present work or in public for fear that a general impression would get out that Dianetics had something to do with spiritualism.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, ''Science of Survival'', footnote p. 61. Hubbard College of Scientology, East Grinstead (1967 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Winter recorded his dissatisfaction with the state of affairs, believing that "Foundation dianetics was becoming crystallized, ritualistic and sterile", characterized by a "none-too-subtle antagonism towards the medical profession in general and the psychiatric field in particular." He commented that "any attempts to force the medical profession to accept it solely on the basis of the affirmation, "It works!" and deriding those who request more conclusive proof, is more than likely to jeopardize whatever possible benefits there might be." Having failed to steer the Foundation onto "a more reasoned and conservative basis", he resigned in October 1950.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, ''Dianetics: A Doctor's Report'' pp. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; Art Ceppos, the publisher of ''Dianetics'', also resigned at this time, cutting off the Foundation's supply of books; he went on to publish Winter's critical book on Dianetics.

John W. Campbell became dissatisfied as well, accusing Hubbard of "dogmatism and authoritarianism" after the latter insisted that only the Hubbard-approved "Standard Procedure" of Dianetics be used and condemned all other methods as dangerous "Black Dianetics".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, letter in ''The Arc Light'', 25 (May 1952), pp. 6-8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a departure from Hubbard's previously liberal outlook, when he had rejected any attempt to monopolise Dianetics. Campbell resigned from the board in March 1951; although he remained interested in Dianetics for several years afterwards, he eventually moved on to other causes.

The most serious breach occurred with Hubbard's wife Sara, the Foundation's librarian and formerly his personal auditor and research subject. According to Barbara Klowdan, his public relations assistant, both had had affairs—Sara with Miles Hollister, a Dianetics instructor in Los Angeles, and Hubbard with Klowdan herself. Sara was suspended from the Foundation's board of directors and her official post. She filed divorce papers in March 1951, and her claims of "systematic torture" allegedly suffered at Hubbard's hands attracted widespread media attention.&lt;ref&gt;"Dianetics Inventor Sued for Divorce, Wife's Complaint Charges He Subjected Her To 'Scientific Torture Experiments'", ''Los Angeles Times'', April 24, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, Hubbard told the FBI that Sara had tried to kill him: "I was knocked out, had a needle thrust into my heart to give it a jet of air to produce "coronary thrombosis" and was given an electric shock with a 110 volt current."&lt;ref name="xenu.net"&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-110.html letter to FBI of May 14 1951]&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard later characterized the suit as "a gal I wasn't even married to was suing me for divorce."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "SOP 5 long form step III - spacation", lecture of January 19, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubbard appears to have believed that his organization was under sustained attack from Communist interests. From March 2, 1951, all employees of the Dianetic Foundations were "requested to sign a strong oath of loyalty to the U.S. government, a denial of Communism and that their fingerprints be taken and forwarded to the F.B.I." Those who had left the organization, he claimed, were Communist agents; he called Winter a "psycho-neurotic discharged officer of the US Army Medical Corps... Winter seemed to have Communist connections." In one letter to the FBI, he claimed that Ceppos was "connected with Communists"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-92.html Memo from F. J. Baumgardner to M.H. Holm] March 7, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; and had tried to obtain the Foundation's mailing list of sixteen thousand names for purposes of distributing Communist literature:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-100.html Letter to Director FBI from SAC Newark], March 21, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; in another, he denounced Sara Hubbard and Miles Hollister as "Communist Party members or suspects", describing Hollister as having a "broad forehead, rather Slavic."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, [http://www.xenu.net/archive/FBI/fbi-89.html letter to FBI of March 3 1951]&lt;/ref&gt;  He complained that "the Communist Party or members of the Communist Party have in the past year wiped out a half a million operation for me, have cost me my health and have considerably retarded material of interest to the United States Government."&lt;ref name="xenu.net"/&gt;

In January 1951, the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners instituted proceedings against the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Elizabeth for teaching medicine without a licence.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation'', Elizabeth, New Jersey. January 1951&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation closed its doors, causing the proceedings to be vacated, but its creditors began to demand settlement of its outstanding debts.

==Dianetics in Kansas==

A temporary respite from financial difficulties was provided in April 1951 by Don Purcell, a millionaire Dianeticist from [[Wichita, Kansas]]. Purcell bankrolled a new Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Wichita and paid to print a new edition of ''Dianetics'', along with several new Dianetics books -- ''Self Analysis'', ''[[Science of Survival]]'', ''Notes on the Lectures'', ''Advanced Procedure and Axioms'' and ''[[Child Dianetics]]''—and a range of other Dianetics pamphlets and publications.

The new Foundation soon found itself pursued by creditors, however, as the other Foundations collapsed under the weight of unpaid debts. The income of the Wichita Foundation was far more modest than the earlier Foundations had enjoyed, as public interest in Dianetics had waned. Only 112 people attended the first major conference held at Wichita, and only 51 students attended a subsequent lecture series in October 1951.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, Helen. ''Dianetics in Limbo''. Whitmore, Philadelphia (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] observed that "the dianetics craze seems to have burned itself out as quickly as it caught fire".&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Martin. ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]''. 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, creditors forced the Wichita Foundation into bankruptcy. Hubbard sold his holdings to Purcell for a nominal sum and established a "Hubbard College" on the other side of Wichita, leaving Purcell to sort out the bankruptcy proceedings. The remaining assets of the Foundation, comprising the copyright of all the tapes, books, techniques, processes and paraphernalia of Dianetics, including the name, went to the auction block; Purcell bought them outright, but Hubbard's financial straits were not improved. One of his staff, James Elliot, sent out an appeal on his behalf: "Somehow Mr. Hubbard must get funds to keep Dianetics from being closed down everywhere. ... He is penniless", and wrote of Hubbard's wish to establish a "free school in Phoenix for the rehabilitation of auditors."&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, James. Circular letter of April 21, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; This school was launched around April 1952 as the Hubbard Association of Scientologists; he could not use the name "Dianetics", as he no longer owned it.

In May 1952, Purcell's Foundation sent its members a set of accounts showing that it had earned $141,821 but was overspent by $63,222.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell circular letter of May 21, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard responded angrily, alleging that the American Medical Association had paid Purcell $500,000 to wreck Dianetics.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Anatomy of the Theta Body", lecture of March 1952&lt;/ref&gt; He later claimed that the Communist Party had paid Purcell "to do in a Central Organization".&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "E-meter", lecture of May 19, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; On December 16, 1952, Hubbard was arrested in the middle of a lecture for failing to return $9,000 withdrawn from the Wichita Foundation. He eventually settled the debt by paying $1,000 and returning a car that he had borrowed from Purcell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jon | last=Atack | authorlink=Jon Atack | title=[[A Piece of Blue Sky]] | publisher=[[Lyle Stuart]] | location= | year=1990 | editor= | isbn=0-8184-0499-X | page=135 | chapter=Part 3, Chapter 4. Knowing How to Know | chapterurl=http://www.religio.de/books/atack/bs3-4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purcell finally tired of pursuing Hubbard over the bankruptcy and handed back the Dianetics copyrights in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;"Dianetics and Scientology Organizations United Again", ''The Journal of Scientology'', issue 36-G, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

==From Dianetics to Scientology==

Dianetics provided the seed from which the philosophical framework of [[Scientology]] grew.  Scientologists refer to the book ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health'' as "Book One". Hubbard created his own calendar based on the publication date of ''Dianetics''; a date of "A.D. 13" signifies "Year 13 After Dianetics", or 1963.

In 1952, Hubbard published a new set of teachings as "Scientology, a [[religious philosophy]]". Scientology did not replace Dianetics but extended it to cover new areas, augmenting the Dianetic axioms with new, additional, Scientology axioms. Where the goal of Dianetics is to rid the individual of his reactive mind engrams, the stated goal of Scientology is to rehabilitate the individual's spiritual nature so that he may reach his full potential.

In 1975, "Dianetics Today" was published, an all-inclusive volume of over 1000 pages. The book introduced the use of the [[E-Meter]], the Original Assessment or standardized interview and a rote routine (Referred to as "R3R") for the application of Dianetics. This was known as Standard Dianetics.

In 1978, Hubbard released "New Era Dianetics", a revised version supposed to produce better results in a shorter period of time; "Preclears who might have needed over 2,000 hours of auditing to achieve the highest results obtainable from 1950 technology might now achieve comparable gains in a tenth of that time with modern Dianetics and Scientology auditing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neweradianetics.org.uk/page03.htm "About New Era Dianetics Auditing"]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of Scientology]] practices and disseminates both the original Dianetics and New Era Dianetics, and views Dianetics as an introduction to Scientology. As of 2001, the Church of Scientology continued to run television [[advertising|advertisements]] promoting ''Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health''.  In spite of this, an analysis of the approximate annual sales of Dianetics that was based on the Church's published data indicated that 2002 sales of Dianetics were similar to sales levels of the book in the early 1970s, and sales of the book reached its peak in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lermanet.com/howmany.htm "Dianetic Sales Drop to 1971 Levels"]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps indicative of the reason for that peak, ''[[Time Magazine]]'', in 1991, alleged that the Church asked its members to purchase large quantities of the book with their own money, or with money supplied by the Church, for the sole purpose of keeping the book on the [[New York Times Best Seller list]].&lt;ref&gt;Behar, Richard. "The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power", ''Time'', May 6, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3947">:''NB: The Native American community is sensitive to [[cultural appropriation]] of their traditions.  This article summarizes an [[anthropological]] perspective and does not provide specific guidance on authentic ceremonies.''

The '''''I-ni-pi''''' ceremony ([[Lakota language|lakota]]: ''ini-'' from ''inyan'', rock + ''-pi'', lodge), a type of [[sweat lodge]], is a [[Lakota people|Lakota]] purification ceremony, and one of the Seven Sacred Rites of the Lakota people.&lt;ref name="poc1"&gt;[http://www.123hjemmeside.dk/indianerforedrag/5945831 "Looking Horse Proclamation on the Protection of Ceremonies"], March 13, 2003. Retrieved April 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is an ancient and sacred ceremony of the Lakota people and has been passed down through the generations of Lakota.

The full ceremony is not taught to non-Lakotas, but in rough detail it involves an ''I-ni-pi'' lodge - a frame of saplings covered with hides or blankets. Stones are heated in a fire, then placed into a central pit in the lodge. Water is then poured on the stones to create hot steam. Traditional prayers and songs are offered in the Lakota language.

Those who have inherited and maintained these traditions have issued statements about the standards to be observed in the ''I-ni-pi''.&lt;ref name="poc1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dow1"&gt;[http://www.aics.org/war.html "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality"] June 10, 1993. Retrieved April 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the March 2003 meeting it was agreed among the spiritual leaders and Bundle Keepers of the Lakota, Dakota, Nakota, Cheyenne and Arapahoe Nations that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I-ni-pi (Purification Ceremony): Those that run this sacred rite should be able to communicate with Tun-ca-s'i-la (our Sacred Grandfathers) in their Native Plains tongue. They should also have earned this rite by completing Han-ble-c'i-ya and the four days and four years of the Wi-wanyang wa-c'i-pi.&lt;ref name="poc1"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This also follows upon the decisions made at the Lakota Summit V, an international gathering of US and Canadian Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations, where about 500 representatives from 40 different tribes and bands of the Lakota unanimously passed a "Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality." The declaration was unanimously passed on June 10, 1993. Among other things, it specifies that these ceremonies are only for those of the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota Nations.&lt;ref name="dow1"/&gt;

One concern about outsiders trying to perform these ceremonies is that, not only does it go against the express wishes of the traditional healers who have inherited these ceremonies, but that those who do not know how to do them properly have in some cases caused [[dehydration]] and [[heat stroke]], resulting in injury and even deaths.&lt;ref name="Dehydration and heat-related death"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Byard RW, Riches KJ |title=Dehydration and heat-related death: sweat lodge syndrome |journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=236–9 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16121078 |doi= 10.1097/01.paf.0000163838.92053.fb|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0195-7910&amp;volume=26&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 die in new-age sweat lodge"&gt;{{cite news|first=Suzanne|last=Herel|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Communications]]|title=2 seeking spiritual enlightenment die in new-age sweat lodge|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/06/27/BA212763.DTL|date=2002-06-27|accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isidorus''' (born c. 139) was a native ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[priest]] in the 2nd century during the [[Roman Egypt|Roman rule in Egypt]]. He led the native Egyptian [[revolt]] against [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule during the reign of [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]].&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html, Epitome 72]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
According to the Roman historian [[Dio Cassius]], Isidorus surpassed all his contemporaries in bravery while leading the Egyptians in this revolt, most often called the [[Bucolic War]]. It broke out in 172&amp;ndash;173 as a result of oppressive [[taxation]] in the [[Boucolia marshes]] of the [[Nile Delta]]. At first the Egyptians were successful, having defeated the Romans in a pitched battle. After this victory, they almost captured [[Alexandria]], and probably would have taken the city if [[Avidius Cassius]], the governor of [[Syria]], had not been sent against them from the place he governed. Cassius did not dare to attack the rebels while they were united, knowing that they were too numerous and powerful to be defeated; however, he managed to destroy them by separating them from one another. Thus, the [[Rebellion|rebels]] were finally subdued only when they fell to quarreling.

The revolt had bad consequences for Egypt: it caused great damage to the Egyptian economy and marked the beginning of Egypt's economic decline.

[[File:Meslier.jpg|thumb|Jean Meslier|250px]]
'''Jean Meslier''' ({{IPA-fr|melje|lang}}; also '''Mellier'''; 15 June 1664&lt;ref&gt;See Morehouse (1936, p. 12) and Meslier (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; – 17 June 1729), was a French Catholic priest ([[abbé]]) who was discovered, upon his death, to have written a book-length philosophical essay promoting [[atheism]] and [[materialism]]. Described by the author as his "testament" to his parishioners, the text [[Criticism of religion|criticizes and denounces all religions]].

==Life==
Jean Meslier was born in [[Mazerny]] in the [[Ardennes]]. He began learning [[Latin]] from a neighborhood priest in 1678 and eventually joined the [[seminary]]; he later claimed, in the Author's Preface to his ''Testament'', this was done to please his parents. At the end of his studies, he took [[Holy Orders]] and, on 7 January 1689, became priest at [[Étrépigny]], in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]].

One public disagreement with a local nobleman aside, Meslier was to all appearances generally unremarkable, and he performed his office without complaint or problem for 40 years. He lived like a pauper, and every penny left over was donated to the poor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6MFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR36&amp;dq=%22jean+meslier%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html 1864 introduction to Meslier's ''Testament'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When Meslier died in Étrépigny, there were found in his house three copies of a 633-page [[octavo (book)|octavo]] [[manuscript]] in which the village [[curate]] denounces organized religion as "but a [[wikt:castle in the air|castle in the air]]" and theology as "but ignorance of natural causes reduced to a system".

==Thought==
In his ''Testament'', Meslier repudiated not only the God of conventional Christianity, but even the generic God of the [[natural theology|natural religion]] of the [[deists]].&lt;ref name="antognazza"&gt;[[Maria Rosa Antognazza]] (2006). "Arguments for the existence of God: the continental European debate", pp. 734–735, '''in''' Haakonssen, Knud. ''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy'', vol. 2. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Meslier, the [[problem of evil|existence of evil]] was incompatible with the idea of a good and wise God.&lt;ref name="fonnesu"&gt;Fonnesu, Luca (2006). "The problem of theodicy", pp. 766, '''in''' Haakonssen, Knud. ''The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-century Philosophy'', vol. 2. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He denied that any spiritual value could be gained from suffering,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Byrne, James Leslie Houlden (1995), ''Companion Encyclopedia of Theology'', p. 259. Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the deist's [[argument from design]] against god, by showing the evils that he had permitted in this world.&lt;ref&gt;J. O. Lindsay, (1957), ''The New Cambridge Modern History'', p. 86. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To him, religions were fabrications fostered by ruling elites; although the [[Early Christianity|earliest Christians]] had been exemplary in sharing their goods, Christianity had long since degenerated into encouraging the acceptance of suffering and submission to tyranny as practised by the [[List of French monarchs|kings of France]]: injustice was explained away as being the will of an all-wise Being.&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;John Hedley Brooke (1991), ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'', p. 171. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the arguments used by Meslier against the existence of God were original. In fact, he derived them from books written by orthodox theologians in the debate between the [[Jesuits]], [[Cartesianism|Cartesians]], and [[Jansenism|Jansenists]]. Their inability to agree on a proof for God's existence was taken by Meslier as a good reason not to presume that there were compelling grounds for belief in God.&lt;ref name="antognazza"/&gt;

Meslier's philosophy was that of an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="france1"&gt;Peter France, (1995), ''The new Oxford companion to literature in French'', page 523. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; He also denied the existence of the [[soul]] and dismissed the notion of [[free will]]. In Chapter V, the priest writes, "If God is incomprehensible to man, it would seem rational never to think of Him at all". Meslier later describes God as "a [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]]" and argues that the supposition of God is not prerequisite to morality. In fact, he concludes that "[w]hether there exists a God or not [...] men's moral duties will always be the same so long as they possess their own nature".

[[File:Étrépigny, église20050515.jpg|thumb|200 px|Church of [[Étrépigny]]]]
In his most famous quote, Meslier refers to a man who "...wished that all the great men in the world and all the nobility could be hanged, and strangled with the guts of the priests."&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meslier, ''Testament'', ch. 2: «''Il souhaitait que tous les grands de la Terre et que tous les nobles fussent pendus et étranglés avec les boyaux des prêtres.''»&lt;/ref&gt; Meslier admits that the statement may seem crude and shocking, but comments that this is what the priests and nobility deserve, not for reasons of revenge or hatred, but for love of justice and truth.&lt;ref&gt;George Huppert (1999), ''The style of Paris: Renaissance origins of the French Enlightenment'', p. 108. Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equally well-known is the version by [[Diderot]]: "And [with] the guts of the last priest let's strangle the neck of the last king."&lt;ref&gt;Diderot, ''Dithrambe sur Féte des Rois'': «''Et des boyaux du dernier prêtre serrons le cou du dernier roi.''»&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[May 1968 events in France|political unrest of May 1968]], the radical students of the [[Sorbonne Occupation Committee]] paraphrased Meslier's epigram, stating that "humanity won’t be happy till the last capitalist is hung with the guts of the last bureaucrat."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/telegrams.html "Telegrams"], ''Situationist International Online'', accessed 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Social Criticism}}
Meslier also vehemently attacked social injustice and sketched out a kind of rural proto-communism.&lt;ref name="france1"/&gt; All the people in a region would belong to a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]] in which wealth would be held in common, and everybody would work. Founded on love and brotherhood, the communes would ally to help each other and preserve peace.&lt;ref&gt;"Utopianism in the Renaissance and Enlightenment", in Donald F. Busky (2002), ''Communism in History and Theory'', pp. 54–55. Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voltaire's ''Extrait''==
Various edited abstracts (known as "extraits") of the ''Testament'' were printed and circulated, condensing the multi-volume original manuscript and sometimes adding material that was not written by Meslier. Abstracts were popular because of the length and convoluted style of the original.

[[Voltaire]] often mentions Meslier (referring to him as "a good priest") in his correspondence, in which he tells his daughter to "read and read again" Meslier's only work, and says that "every honest man should have Meslier's ''Testament'' in his pocket." However, he also described Meslier as writing "in the style of a carriage-horse".

Voltaire published his own expurgated version as ''Extraits des sentiments de Jean Meslier'' (first edition, 1762).&lt;ref name="fonnesu"/&gt; Voltaire's edition changed the thrust of Meslier's arguments (or drew on other Extraits which did this)&lt;ref&gt;See Wade (1933) for a discussion of the different versions and Extraits of the manuscript of the ''Testament''.&lt;/ref&gt; so that he appeared to be a [[deism|deist]]—like Voltaire—rather than an atheist.

The following passage is found at the end of Voltaire's ''Extrait'', and has been cited in support of the view that Meslier was not really an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: McGrath, Alister (2004). ''The Twilight of Atheism'' (p. 24).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the passage does not appear in either the 1864 complete edition of the ''Testament'', published in Amsterdam by Rudolf Charles,&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse (1936, pp. 26–27); see also Wade (1933, p. 387, but especially p. 393-394).&lt;/ref&gt; or in the complete works of Meslier published 1970–1972.&lt;ref&gt;Deprun et al (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I will finish by begging God, so outraged by that sect, to deign to recall us to natural religion, of which Christianity is the declared enemy. To that simple religion that God placed in the hearts of all men, which teaches us that we only do unto others what we want to have done unto us. Then the universe will be composed of good citizens, of just fathers, of submissive children, of tender friends. God gave us this religion in giving us reason. May fanaticism no longer pervert it! I die more filled with these wishes than with hopes. This is the exact summary of the in-folio testament of Jean Meslier. We can judge how weighty is the testimony of a dying priest who asks God's forgiveness.}}

Another book, ''Good Sense'' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Le Bon Sens}}),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftarchives.net/holbach/good/gcontents.htm Baron d'Holbach – ''Good Sense'']&lt;/ref&gt; published anonymously in 1772, was long attributed to Meslier, but was in fact written by [[Baron d'Holbach]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftarchives.net/holbach/good/gsabout.htm Baron d'Holbach – ''Good Sense: Transcription Notes''].
"Holbach published ''Le Bon Sens'' anonymously in 1772. The book was mistakenly identified as the work of Jean Meslier (1664–1729), a Catholic priest who had renounced Christianity in a posthumously published Testament. As late as the 20th century English translations of ''Le Bon Sens'' were still being published under Meslier's name, often bearing such titles as ''Common Sense and Superstition in All Ages''. Editions ascribed to Meslier frequently include an abstract of his ''Testament'' together with Voltaire's correspondence regarding Meslier."&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete ''Testament'' of Meslier was published in English translation (by Michael Shreve) for the first time in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament: Memoir of the Thoughts and Sentiments of Jean Meslier''. Prometheus Books, 2009. {{ISBN|1-59102-749-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In his book ''In Defense of Atheism'' (2007) the  atheist philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] describes Meslier as the first person to write an entire text in support of atheism:

{{quote|text=For the first time (but how long will it take us to acknowledge this?) in the history of ideas, a philosopher had dedicated a whole book to the question of atheism. He professed it, demonstrated it, arguing and quoting, sharing his reading and his reflections, and seeking confirmation from his own observations of the everyday world. His title sets it out clearly: ''Memoir of the Thoughts and Feelings of Jean Meslier''; and so does his subtitle: ''Clear and Evident Demonstrations of the Vanity and Falsity of All the Religions of the World''. The book appeared in 1729, after his death. Meslier had spent the greater part of his life working on it. The history of true atheism had begun.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Onfray, ''In Defence of Atheism'', translation by Jeremy Leggatt, Arcade Publishing, 2007, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Prior to announcing Meslier as the first atheist philosopher, Onfray considers and dismisses [[Cristóvão Ferreira]], a Portuguese and former Jesuit who renounced his faith under Japanese torture in 1633 and went on to write a book titled ''The Deception Revealed''. However, Onfray decides that Ferreira was not such a good candidate as Meslier, since Ferreira converted to [[Zen Buddhism]].

The [[Situationist International|Situationist]] cultural theorist [[Raoul Vaneigem]] praised Meslier's resistance to hierarchical authority, claiming that "the last full-fledged exemplars of priests genuinely loyal to the revolutionary origins of their religion were Jean Meslier and [[Jacques Roux]] fomenting [[jacquerie]] and riot".&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Vaneigem, ''The Revolution of Everyday Life'', trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith, PM Press, 2012, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Colin Brewer (2007), who co-produced a play about Meslier's life,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Historians argue about who was the first overt, post-Classical atheist but Meslier was arguably the first to put his name to an incontrovertibly atheist document. That this important event is largely unrecognised (Meslier was absent from both [[Richard Dawkins]]’ and [[Jonathan Miller]]'s recent TV series on atheism) is due partly to Voltaire who published, in 1761, a grossly distorted "Extract" that portrayed Meslier as a fellow-deist and entirely suppressed Meslier's anti-monarchist, proto-communist opinions.

The '''''Journal of Moral Theology''''' is a [[Academic journal|journal]] that publishes [[peer-reviewed]] scholarly articles in the field of [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] moral [[theology]]. The journal is published [[semiannual|semi-annually]], with regular issues in January and June, that cover theological treatments of related topics in [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[political philosophy]], and [[psychology]]. Articles published in the journal undergo at least two double blind peer reviews before being selected for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Moral Theology|volume=6|issue=2|url=http://digitalarchives.msmary.edu/digital/collection/JMT/id/68/rec/1 |title=Engaging Disability|accessdate=December 4, 2017|publisher=[[Mount St. Mary's University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The journal was established by David Matzko McCarthy of [[Mount St. Mary's University]], then the Fr. James M. Forker Professor of [[Catholic Social Teaching]]. He received considerable assistance from Joshua Hochschild, who was the Mount’s Dean of the College of [[Liberal Arts]] at that time, and from David Cloutier and William Mattison III, who edited the inaugural issue (January 2012). McCarthy’s work on the journal started in early in 2009, and by the end of the year, an intrepid editorial board was formed.
 
The initial board membership was constituted by Melanie Barrett, University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary; Joseph Capizzi, The Catholic University of America; David Cloutier, The Catholic University of America; Kelly Johnson, University of Dayton; M. Therese Lysaught, Loyola University Chicago; Bryan Massingale, Fordham University; William C. Mattison III, University of Notre Dame; Jeanne Heffernan Schindler, John Paul II Institute; Christopher P. Vogt, St. John’s University. The affiliations noted are current (not 2012). David McCarthy is the Associate Provost at Mount St. Mary’s University.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, David M. ''The History of the Journal of Moral Theology.'' [[Mount St. Mary's University]]. December 4, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Jason King took on the role of associate editor, and in 2017, he became the editor. Dr. King is the chair of the Department of Theology, St. Vincent College, Latrobe, PA. The managing editor is Kathy Criasia, Dean's Assistant, the College of Liberal Arts, Mount St. Mary's University. William College is the associate editor; he is Emeritus Professor of Theology and Philosophy, Mount St. Mary's University.

'''Bhai Kahn Singh Nabha''' (30 August 1861 – 24 November 1938) was a [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] [[Sikh]] [[lexicographer]] and [[encyclopedist]]. His most influential work, [[Mahan Kosh]], inspired generations of scholars after him.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; He also played a role in the [[Singh Sabha movement]].

==Biography==
He was born to Narain Singh and Har Kaur at the village of Sabaz Banera, located in what was then [[Patiala State]].&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; His father, Narain Singh succeeded to the charge of [[Gurdwara]] Dera Baba Ajaypal Singh at [[Nabha]], after the death of his grandfather Sarup Singh in 1861.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; Kahn Singh was the eldest of three brothers (the other two being Meehan Singh and Bishan Singh) and one sister (Kahn Kaur).{{cn|date=November 2016}}

He did not attend any school or college for formal education, but studied several branches of learning on his own. By the age of 10 he was able to quote freely from the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and [[Dasam Granth]].&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; In  [[Nabha]], he studied [[sanskrit]] classics with local [[pandit]]s and studied under the famous [[musicologist]] Mahant Gajja Singh.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; In [[Delhi]], he studied [[persian language|persian]] with [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|Mawlawi]]s.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;

In 1883, he continued his study of [[Persian language|persian]] for two years and assisted [[Bhai Gurmukh Singh]], a leader in the [[Singh Sabha Movement]], in publishing ''Sudhararak''.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; In 1887, he was appointed the tutor to [[Ripudaman Singh]], [[heir apparent]] to [[Nabha State]]. He continued to serve [[Nabha State]] in several capacities, from the personal secretary of [[Hira Singh of Nabha|Maharaja Hira Singh]] to judge of the High Court. Between 1915-17, he served [[Patiala State]].&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;

In 1885, he had a chance meeting with [[Max Arthur Macauliffe]] which led to a lifelong friendship as well as scholarly collaboration between the two. When Max Arthur Macauliffe was researching his six volume work entitled "The Sikh Religion", Kahn Singh helped Macauliffe in his study of [[Sikh scriptures]] and the history of early Sikhism.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; When it was published by the [[Clarendon Press]] Kahn Singh was assigned the copyright of the work.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt;

==Works and compositions==
His books ''Gurmat Prabhakar'' and ''Gurmat Sudhakar'' are the standard guide books for understanding [[Sikhism]]. His work, ''[[Mahan Kosh]]'' (known as the Sikh encyclopedia), is his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]. He published magazine ''Khalsa Gazette'' and is also regarded as one of the founders of the weekly newspaper, ''Khalsa Akhbar''. Works from the period 1882-1911 include: 
*''Raj Dharam'' - This was his first book written at a time when he was serving with Maharaja Hira Singh. This was published and distributed on government expense.
*''[[Ham Hindu Nahin]] (We are not Hindus)'' - First published in 1898,&lt;ref name="hhn"&gt;{{cite book|title=ਹਮ ਹਿੰਦੂ ਨਹੀਂ|publisher=Singh Brothers|author=Nabha, Kahn Singh|authorlink=Kahn Singh Nabha|year=2011|location=[[Amritsar]]|page=128|isbn=978-81-7205-051-1|language=Punjabi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="se"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/literature-in-the-singh-sabha-movement/ham-hindu-nahin|title=Ham Hindu Nahin|publisher=TheSikhEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the book is a critique on the distinction of the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion and identity. Bhai Kahn Singh stressed upon the distinct identity of the Sikhs; separate from any other, specially [[Hinduism]]. Initially published in Hindi, it was later translated into [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}
*''Gurmat Prabhakar'' - This book was published in 1898.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Studded with beautiful examples from Sri Guru Granth Sahib, this book condemns the superstitions prevailing in the Indian society. Difficult words have been made simpler through special commentaries at different places in the book.
*''Gurmat Sudhakar'' - Published in 1899, this book contains evidences from [[Dasam Granth]], Works of [[Bhai Gurdas]], Janam Sakhi [[Guru Nanak]], Gurbilas, Guru Nanak Prakash, Suraj Prakash, Panth Prakash, Sau Sakhi (Guru Ratan Mala), Rehatnama, etc. supporting the various practices and beliefs of [[Sikhism]].
*''Sad Parmarth''
*''Gurchhand Diwakar''
*''Gur Shabdalankar''
*''Roop Deep Pingal''
*''[[Guru Shabad Ratnakar Mahan Kosh]]'' - An encyclopedia of Sikh literature started in 1912, this beautiful masterpiece was accomplished in 1926 after 14 years of research and painstaking effort and finally published by the princely state of [[Patiala]]. The state spent Rs.51,000 on its publishing. At 3338 pages, the book was divided into four volumes and was priced at Rs.110. It still serves as one of the most reliable reference material for research on Sikh faith and beliefs and also on the [[Punjabi culture]].
*''Gurmat Martand''
*''Gur Mahima Sangraha'' - This book contained the biographies and important works reflecting the Sikh thought of some of the most famous Punjabi and Hindi poets. It is considered as a very important Historical document and still remains unpublished.

A '''khanqah''' or '''khaniqah''' (also transliterated as '''''khankahs ''''', '''''khaneqa''''', '''''khanegah''''' or '''''khaneqah''''' ({{lang-fa|خانقاه}})), also known as a '''ribat''' ({{lang|fa|رباط}}) – among other terms – is a building designed specifically for gatherings of a [[Sufism|Sufi brotherhood]] or ''[[tariqa]]'' and is a place for spiritual retreat and character reformation. In the past, and to a lesser extent nowadays, they often served as hospices for [[salik]]s (Sufi travelers), [[Murid]]s (initiates) and [[talibe|talibs]] (Islamic students). Khanqahs are very often found adjoined to [[dargah]]s (shrines of Sufi saints), [[mosque]]s and [[madrasa]]s (Islamic schools). 

In the [[Arab world]], especially [[North Africa]], the khanqah is known as a '''[[Zawiya (institution)|zāwiyah]]''' ({{lang-ar|زاویه}}, plural ''zāwiyāt''; also transliterated as ''zawiya'', ''zāwiya'' or ''zaouia''). In [[Turkey]], [[Iran]] and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman areas]] like [[Albania]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], they are locally referred to as '''tekije''' (تكيه; also transliterated as '''''tekke''''', ''[[tekyeh]]'', ''teqe'' or ''takiyah''). In South Asia, the words ''khanqah'' and ''dargah'' are used interchangeably for Sufi shrines. In addition, there are lodges in Central and South Asia often referred to as Qalander Khane that serve as rest houses for the unaffiliated [[Qalandariyya|malang]], [[dervish]]es and [[fakir]]s.

Khanqahs later spread across the Islamic world, from [[Morocco]] to [[Indonesia]].

== First Khanqah in India ==
The first khanqah in India is located in Maner sharif. It is established approx more than 800 years ago. Khanquah Maner Sharif has been the centre of fourteen sufi's Order. Of them  - Soharvardia order(silsila) and Firdausia order(silsila) have spread vastly throughout the Indian sub-continent. The Khanqah Maner Sharif still exists and are following on the path shown by Imam Taj Faqih and Sultan-ul-Makhdoom.

All khanqahs, regardless of size, feature a large central hall. The daily ritual prayers incumbent on all [[Muslim]]s, [[salat]], are held in this hall, as are the specifically Sufi forms of [[dhikr]], meditation and celebration of the divine.

Large khanqahs often grew up around the dargah of a tariqa's founder or of a Sufi saint.

Some khanqahs include dwellings for the Sufi sheikh or pir, and his family, or cells for Sufis who wish to pursue their dhikr in quiet and isolation. They may also include lodgings for traveling Sufis and pilgrims and premises for charities such as hospitals.

Sufi movements have been banned in some Muslim-majority countries such as [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Saudi Arabia]], or the [[communism|communist]] and post-communist states of [[Central Asia]]. In these countries, khanqahs have been converted to other purposes, turned into museums or mosques. In other countries, Sufism survives and the old khanqahs are still in use.

[[Image:Kesubah.JPG|thumb|A modern [[Ketubah]] (Jewish wedding contract).]]

The '''Lieberman clause''' is a clause included in a [[ketubah]], a Jewish wedding document, created by and named after Talmudic scholar and [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] professor [[Saul Lieberman]], that stipulates that [[divorce]] will be adjudicated by a modern [[Bet Din]] (rabbinic court) in order to prevent the problem of the [[agunah]], a woman not allowed to remarry because she had never been granted a religious divorce.  It was first introduced in the 1950s by [[rabbi]]s in [[Judaism]]'s [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]]. 

== Background ==

According to [[Halakha]] (Jewish law) when a couple gets divorced it is the man who has to present the woman with a bill of divorce, called a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]''.  Without one the couple is still viewed as married, whether a civil divorce is obtained or not. In the past, if a woman was refused a divorce because a man would not give his wife a ''get'', the rabbis of the local Jewish community were authorized, under certain circumstances, to force the husband to do so (e.g., his refusal to be intimate with his wife as well as not giving the ''get'', or other such serious matters). However since the [[Haskalah]], local Jewish communities lost their autonomous status, and were subsumed into the nation in which they existed. The Jewish community lost its civil powers to enforce marriage and divorce laws. The unintended result was that rabbis lost the power to force a man to give his wife a ''get'', and Jewish law does not allow a woman to give a ''get'' to the husband. Without a ''get'', a Jewish woman is forbidden to remarry and is therefore called an ''agunah'' (literally "an anchored woman").

For decades traditional voices within the Rabbinical Assembly counseled that Conservative Jews should take no unilateral action on this issue, and should wait for solutions from the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox community]], or joint action with the Orthodox community.  While numerous solutions were offered, none were accepted. Eventually liberal voices within the Rabbinical Assembly won out, and the movement authorized unilateral action.

Lieberman developed a clause to be added to the [[Jewish view of marriage|ketubah]] (Jewish wedding document). In effect, it was an arbitration agreement used in the case of a divorce; if the marriage dissolved and the woman was refused a ''get'' from her husband, both the husband and wife were to go to a rabbinic court authorized by the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] and heed their directives, which could (and usually did) include ordering a man to give his wife a ''get''. 

According to leaders of the Conservative movement, a meeting was held between the leaders of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] (RA), representing the Conservative movement, and the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA), the largest organization of Orthodox rabbis, in an effort to find agreement that the clause was valid from the standpoint of Jewish law, and would be included in both Orthodox and Conservative documents.&lt;ref name="MR"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/agunot.html Meyer E. Rabinowitz (Chairman, Joint Bet Din of the Conservative Movement), ''Agunot (Abandoned Wives),'' 1998, adapted from his comments to the 1998 Agunot Conference, in Jerusalem.]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time this clause was proposed it had some support in the Modern Orthodox community, and Orthodox leader Rabbi [[Joseph Soloveitchik]] gave this proposal his approval. However, the Orthodox movement never acted to include the clause, and eventually most Orthodox rabbis seem to have united in their rejection of the clause as a violation of Jewish law. As a result, it has only been used for wedding documents and ceremonies in some (but not all) non-Orthodox [[denominations of Judaism]].

== Changes in Conservative usage ==

This clause is still used in many ''ketubot'' (wedding documents) used by Conservative Jews today. However, in the intervening years there has been growing concern regarding the legal validity of this clause due to the United States stand on the [[separation of church and state]].  For that reason, state courts have disagreed in terms of recognition of this clause, in a religious document, in a civilian legal setting.

As a response to this concern, a separate letter was drawn up, and signed by the prospective bride and groom, acknowledging that the conditions of the ''ketuba'' had been explained to them, and that this letter would be recognized by them as a separate civil document, enforceable in U.S. courts. 

However, even some Conservative rabbis grew to have misgivings about the religious validity of this approach, eventually leading the Joint Bet Din (rabbinical court) of the Conservative Movement to develop [[Agunah#Conservative_Judaism|alternative approaches]] to the problem of the ''agunah'', which include but are not limited to ''hafka'at kiddushin'', retroactive annulment of the marriage.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt;

{{Lingayatism}}
{{Saivism}}
{{Hinduism}}

'''Lingayatism''' is a [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] Hindu religious tradition in [[India]].{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=208-209}}{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=6}}&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt; Initially known as ''[[Veerashaivas]]'', since the 18th century adherents of this faith are known as ''Lingayats''.

The terms ''Lingayatism'' and ''[[Veerashaivism]]'' have been used synonymously,{{refn|group=note|name=Lingayatism-Veerashaivism}} but ''Veerashaivism'' may refer to the broader ''Veerashaiva'' philosophy which predates Lingayatism,{{sfn|Blake Michael|1992|p=18, note 1}} to the historical community now called ''Lingayats'',{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=71}} and to a contemporary (sub)tradition within Lingayatism with Vedic influences.&lt;ref name=thehindu_2017_03_23 group=web/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Panchacharyas_dating}} Meanwhile, ''Lingayatism'' may refer to the whole Lingayat community, but also to a contemporary (sub)tradition dedicated to Basava's original thought, and to a movement within this community which strives toward recognition as an independent religion. While some Vedic oriented Veerashaivas consider the two contemporary (sub)traditions to be "one and the same community" belonging to Hinduism,&lt;ref name=BS_2018 group=web/&gt;

Lingayatism was founded, or revived,{{refn|group=note|name=Panchacharyas_dating}} by the 12th-century philosopher and statesman [[Basava]] in Karnataka.{{sfn|Ishwaran|1981|p=76-78}} Lingayat scholars thrived in northern Karnataka during the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] (14th-18th century). In the 21st century, some Lingayats have sought legal recognition as a religion distinct from Hinduism and Veerashaivas,{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=175}}&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=separate_identity}} a request which gained support from the Congress-led Karnataka government in 2018.&lt;ref name=BS_2018 group=web/&gt;&lt;ref name=thehindu_2017_03_23 group=web/&gt;

Lingayatism is generally considered a Hindu sect as{{sfn|Levinson|Christensen|2002|p=475}}&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Hindu_sect}} their beliefs include many Hindu elements.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=175}}{{refn|group=note|name=shared_beliefs}} Worship is centred on [[Shiva]] as the universal god in the iconographic form of ''Ishtalinga''.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=208-209}}{{refn|group=note|name=Dalal_linga|Roshen Dalal (2010): "The linga is worshipped by all Shaivites, but it is the special emblem of the Lingayats or Virashaivas, a Shaivite sect."{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=208-209}}}} Lingayatism emphasises [[qualified monism]], with philosophical foundations similar to those of the 11th–12th-century South Indian philosopher [[Ramanuja]].&lt;ref group=web name=EB_Lingayat/&gt; Lingayatism rejects any form of social discrimination including the caste system.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|pp=52-56}}

Contemporary Lingayatism is influential in [[South India]], especially in the state of [[Karnataka]].{{sfn|Gall|Hobby|2009|p=567–570}} Lingayats celebrate anniversaries (''jayanti'') of major religious leaders of their tradition, as well as Hindu festivals such as the [[Shivaratri]] and [[Ganesh Chaturthi]].&lt;ref name=Patil34/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbell149/&gt;&lt;ref name="Srinivas1995p158"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.N.

==Etymology==
Lingayatism is derived from the Sanskrit root ''[[linga]]'' (Shiva icon) and suffix ''ayta''.&lt;ref name="Iyer1965"/&gt; The adherents of Lingayatism are known as ''Lingayats''. In historical literature, they are sometimes referred to as Lingawants, Lingangis, Lingadharis, Sivabhaktas, Virasaivas or Veerashaivas.&lt;ref name="Iyer1965"&gt;{{cite book|author=L.K.A. Iyer|title=The Mysore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9jbqGLH7ioC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1965|publisher=Mittal Publications|pages=81–82|id=GGKEY:HRFC6GWCY6D}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Lingayat is based on the practice of both genders of Lingayats wearing an ''iṣṭaliṅga'' contained inside a silver box with a necklace all the time. The ''istalinga'' is an oval-shaped emblem symbolising [[Parashiva]], the absolute reality and icon of their spirituality.&lt;ref name="Iyer1965"/&gt;

Historically, ''Lingayats'' were known as ''Virashaivas'',{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=71}} or "ardent, heroic worshippers of Shiva."{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=1-5}} According to Blake Michael, the term ''Veerashaivism'' refers both to a "philosophical or theological system as well as to the historical, social and religious movement which originated from that system." ''Lingayatism'' refers to the modern adherents of this religion.{{sfn|Blake Michael|1992|p=18, note 1}} The term Lingayats came to be commonly used during the British colonial period.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=71}}

In 1926, the Bombay High Court ruled that "the Veerashaivas are not Shudras; they are Lingi Brahmins [Brahmins who wear the Linga] of
the highest order." While the administrators of the 1931 Census "were instructed to list them as Lingi Brahmins," the term was not being used by Lingayats to describe themselves.{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=145, note 7}}

==Lingayatism and Veerashaivism==
The origins of Lingayatism is traced to the 11th- and 12th-century CE in a region that includes northern Karnataka and nearby districts of South India. This region was a stronghold of [[Jainism]] and [[Shaivism]]. According to Iyer and other scholars, the Lingayatism theology emerged as a definitive egalitarian movement in this theological milieu, grew rapidly beyond north Karnataka. The Lingayats, states Burjor Avari quoting Jha, were "extremely anti-Jain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Burjor Avari|title=India: The Ancient Past: A History of the Indian Subcontinent from c. 7000 BCE to CE 1200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XziTDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT285|year=2016|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-23672-6|page=285}}, Quote: "In the long run, however, their [Jain] influence in Karnataka waned owing to the rise of the Lingayat sect of the Virashaivas, led by a saint known as Basav. The Lingayats were extremely anti-Jain."&lt;/ref&gt; The Veerashaiva philosophy enabled Lingayats to "win over the Jains to Shiva worship".&lt;ref name="Iyer1965"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Kuiper |title=The Culture of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c8PJFLeURhsC |year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-61530-149-2|pages=147–148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lingayats were also anti-Brahamin as evidenced by the polemics against the Brahmins in early Veerashaiva literature, much like the periodic anti-Brahmin polemics found in South Indian Hindu literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=D.

According to a tradition which developed after Basava's time,{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=5}}&lt;!-- **START OF NOTE** --&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Panchacharyas_dating|Dating of ''Panchacharyas'' tradition:&lt;br&gt;* Schouten (1995): "The death of Basava certainly did not bring the Virasaiva movement to an end [...] Virasaivism gained a firm foothold in Hindu culture. In this process of consolidation, it was felt to be appropriate to emphasize the agreements, rather than the deviations, with the dominant religion. Hence, the Virasaivas tended to present themselves as pure Hindus who shared the age-old religious tradition. This went so far that the role of Basava as the founder of the movement was downplayed. Virasaivas even claimed that their school of thought already existed long before Basava. In their imagination, they sometimes traced the history of Virasaivism back to primordial times. Legends arose among them which related that five teachers, sprung from the five faces of Siva, descended to earth, in each of the ages of the world under different names, in order to preach the eternal truth of Virasaivism. Basava would have been nothing more than a reviver of this religion which had existed from times immemorial."{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=5}}&lt;br&gt;* Bairy: "[Venkatrao, in 1919 the president of the Karnataka History Congress], mentions that many Lingayaths took objections to him mentioning Basava as the founder of Veerashaivism in his writings. Finding that very strange and unfathomable, he asks a Lingayath friend about the reasons for this. The friend tells him how that very question - of whether Basava is the founder of Veerashaivism (accepting which would not only mean that it is dated to as recent as the twelfth century but also subverts the Panchacharya tradition which claimed a more antiquarian past) or just a reformer - was a major bone of contention between the two sections of Lingayaths.{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=147-148}}&lt;br&gt;* According to Aditi Mangaldas, in the 14th century ''Veerashaivism'' developed as a sub-sect of Lingayatism.{{sfn|Mangaldas|Vaidyanathan|2014|p=55}}}}&lt;!-- **END OF NOTE** --&gt;  ''Veerashaivism'' was transmitted by five ''Panchacharyas'', namely Renukacharya, Darukacharya, Ekorama, Panditharadhya, and Vishweswara, and first taught by Renukacharya to sage [[Agasthya]], a Vedic seer.&lt;ref name=Wire_2017 group=web/&gt; A central text in this tradition is [[Siddhanta Shikhamani]], which was written in Sanskrit, and gives an elaboration of "the primitive traits of Veerashaivism [found] in the Vedas and the Upanishads" and "the concrete features given to it in the latter parts (Uttarabhaga) of the Saivagamas."&lt;ref name=Amazon group=web/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSS"&gt;M. Sivakumara Swamy, translator (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; While Veerashaivas regard the ''Siddhanta Shikhamani'' to predate Basava, it may actually have been composed in the 13th or 14th century, post-dating Basava.&lt;ref name=Wire_2017 group=web/&gt;

According to [[Gauri Lankesh]],{{refn|group=note|name=Lankesh}} "Lingayats are followers of Basavanna," while Veerashaivism is a Vedic Shaiva tradition, which "accepts the Vedic texts and practices like caste and gender discrimination."&lt;ref name=Wire_2017 group=web/&gt; Basava's reform movement attracted Shaivite Brahmins from Andhra Pradesh; a century after Basava, "their descendants started mixing practices from their former religion with Lingayatism."&lt;ref name=Wire_2017 group=web/&gt; Basava's teachings also got mixed-up with Vedic teachings because much sharana literature was lost after the exile of sharana authors from the Bijjala kingdom.&lt;ref name=Wire_2017 group=web/&gt;

According to Gauri Lankesh,{{refn|group=note|name=Lankesh}} Veerashaivism is preserved and transmitted by five peethas (Rambhapuri, Ujjaini, Kedar, Shreeshail, Kashi), which play an essential role in the Veerashaiva tradition.&lt;ref name=Wire_2017 group=web/&gt; In contrast, the ''virakta'' monastic organisation upheld "the ideals of Basava and his contemporaries."{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=15}}{{refn|group=note|According to Chandan Gowda, these five mathas "predate Basava."&lt;ref name=thehindu_2018_03_23 group=web/&gt; Yet, according to Schouten, monasteries of the older Saiva schools, "such as the [[Kalamukha]]," were taken over by the Virasaivas.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=14}} Two kinds of monastic orders developed, the more conservative''gurusthalada'' monasteries, and the ''viraktas'' which were faithful to "the ideals of Basava and his contemporaries."{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=15}}}} According to Bairy, the ''virakta'' tradition criticised "[t]he Panchacharya tradition, the Mathas which belonged to it and the (upper) castes which owed their allegiance to them" for their support of Brahmins and their deviation from Basava's ideals.{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=145-146 (note 8)}}{{refn|group=note|Bairy: "The Panchacharya tradition, the Mathas which belonged to it and the (upper) castes which owed their allegiance to them were accused by those espousing the Viraktha tradition of actively collaborating with the Brahmins in order to defame the 'progressive' twelfth century movement, which apparently spoke against caste distinctions and often incurred the displeasure of the upper castes within the Lingayath fold."{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=145-146 (note 8)}}}}

According to Sri Sharanbasava Devaru of Charanteshwar Mutt, interviewed in 2013, Lingayatism is a separate religion, distinct from the Hindu cultural identity, while Veerashaivism is a Shaivite sect "based on Vedic philosophy."&lt;ref name=thehindu_2017_Sharanbasava group=web/&gt; Sri Sharanbasava Devaru further states that Veerashaivism "started gaining importance only after 1904 with some mutts mixing Veerashaivism with Lingayatism."&lt;ref name=thehindu_2017_Sharanbasava group=web/&gt;

According to India Today, while "Veerashaivas' claim that the two communities are one and the same," orthodox Lingayats claim that they are different.&lt;ref name=India_Today group=web/&gt; Lingayats claim that Veerashaivas do not truly follow Basava, accept Vedic literature, and "worship idols of Lord Shiva."&lt;ref name=India_Today group=web/&gt; Veerashaivas further "owe allegiance to various religious centres (mutts), [while] the Lingayats mostly follow their own gurus."&lt;ref name=India_Today group=web/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Lingayatism}}

===Basava (12th century)===
{{See also|Basava}}
[[File:Basava Gaint Statue 108 feet, Basava Kalyana.JPG|thumb|right|[[Basava]], the influential leader of Lingayatism&lt;ref group=web name=EB_Basava/&gt;]]

The [[Vachana sahitya|Sharana-movement]], which started in the 11th century, is regarded by some as the start of Veerashaivism.{{sfn|Shiva Prakash|1997|p=168-169}} It started in a time when [[Kalamukha]] Shaivism, which was supported by the ruling classes, was dominant, and in control of the monasteries.{{sfn|Shiva Prakash|1997|p=168}} The Sharana-movement was inspired by the [[Nayanars]], and emphasised personal religious experience over text-based dogmatism.{{sfn|Shiva Prakash|1997|p=169}}

The traditional legends and hagiographic texts state Basava to be the founder of the Lingayats and its secular practices.{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=239–240}}{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=52-53}}&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt; He was a 12th-century Hindu philosopher, [[politician|statesman]], [[Kannada]] poet in the Shiva-focused [[Bhakti movement]] and a [[Social reformers of India|social reformer]] during the reign of the [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalachuri]] king [[Bijjala II]] (reigned 1157–1167) in [[Karnataka]], India.{{sfn|Ishwaran|1981|p=76}}&lt;ref group=web name=EB_Basava/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Encyclopedia Britannica: "Basava, (flourished 12th century, South India), Hindu religious reformer, teacher, theologian, and administrator of the royal treasury of the Kalachuri-dynasty king Bijjala I (reigned 1156–67)."&lt;ref group=web name=EB_Basava/&gt;}}

Basava grew up in a [[Brahmin]] family with a tradition of Shaivism.{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=52-53}}{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=2-3}} As a leader, he developed and inspired a new devotional movement named ''Virashaivas'', or "ardent, heroic worshippers of Shiva". This movement shared its roots in the ongoing Tamil [[Bhakti movement]], particularly the Shaiva [[Nayanars]] traditions, over the 7th- to 11th-century. However, Basava championed devotional worship that rejected temple worship with rituals led by Brahmins, and emphasized personalised direct worship of Shiva through practices such as individually worn icons and symbols like a small [[linga]].{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=1-5}}

Basavanna spread social awareness through his poetry, popularly known as ''Vachanaas''. Basavanna rejected gender or social discrimination, and caste distinctions,{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=52}} as well as some extant practices such as the wearing of sacred thread,{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=239–240}} and replaced this with the ritual of wearing ''[[Ishtalinga]]'' necklace, with an image of the [[Lingam|Shiva Liṅga]],{{sfn|Bunce|2010|p=983}} by every person regardless of his or her birth, to be a constant reminder of one's [[bhakti]] (loving devotion) to god Shiva. As the chief minister of his kingdom, he introduced new public institutions such as the ''Anubhava Mantapa'' (or, the "hall of spiritual experience"),{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=2-3}} which welcomed men and women from all socio-economic backgrounds to discuss spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.{{sfn|Das|2005|p=161-162}}

After initially supporting Basava, king Bijjala II disagreed with Basava's rejection of caste distinctions. In 1167 the Veerashaivas were repressed, and most of them left Kalyāna, Bijjala's new capital, spreading Basava's teachings into a wider area in southern India. The king was assassinated by the Veerashaivas in 1168.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|pp=5-6}}

===Consolidation (12th–14th century)===
After Basava's death, Shaivism consolidated its influence in southern India, meanwhile adjusting to Hindu orthodoxy.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=6}} Basava's nephew Channabasava organised the community and systematised Virasaiva theology, moving the Virashaiva community toward the mainstream Hindu culture.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=14-15}} Basava's role in the origins of Shaivism was downplayed, and a mythology developed in which the origins of Veerashaivism were attributed to the five Panchacharyas, descending to earth in the different world-ages to teach Shaivism. In this narrative, Basava was regarded as a reviver of this ancient teaching.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=6}}{{refn|group=note|According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, "According to South Indian oral tradition, he was the actual founder of the Lingayats, but study of Kalachuri inscriptions indicates that, rather than founding a new sect, he in fact revived an existing one."&lt;ref group=web name=EB_Basava/&gt;{{dubious|date=March 2018}}}}

Monasteries of the older Saiva schools, "such as the [[Kalamukha]]," were taken over by the Virasaivas.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=14}} Two kinds of monastic orders developed. Due to their roots in the traditional schools, the ''gurusthalada'' monasteries were more conservative, while the ''viraktas'' "constituted the true Virasaiva monastic organisation, shaped by the ideals of Basava and his contemporaries."{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=15}}

===Vijayanagara Empire (15th–17th century)===
In the 14th-15th century, a Lingayat revival took place in northern Karnataka in the [[Vijayanagara Empire]].{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=15}}{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=64}} The Lingayats likely were a part of the reason why Vijayanagara succeeded in territorial expansion and in withstanding the Deccan Sultanate wars. The Lingayat text ''[[Sunyasampadane]]'' grew out of the scholarly discussions in an Anubhava Mantapa, and according to Bill Aitken, these were "compiled at the Vijayanagara court during the reign of Praudha Deva Raya".{{sfn|Aitken|1999|p=109–110, 213–215}} Similarly, the scripture of Lingayatism ''[[Basava Purana]]'' was completed in 1369 during the reign of Vijayanagara ruler [[Bukka Raya I]].{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=64}}

===Ikkeri Nayakas, Keladi dynasty (16th-18th century)===
The Virasaivas were an important part of the Vijayanagara empire army. They fought the Bijapur Sultans, and the Virasaiva leader Sadasiva Nayaka played a key role in leading the capture of Sultanate fortress such as at Gulbarga.&lt;ref name="Stein1989p84"/&gt; This success led to Nayaka being appointed as the governor of the coastal Karnataka Kanara region. This emerged as a Lingayat dynasty, called the [[Nayakas of Keladi]]. Another group of Virasaivas merchants turned warriors of the Vijayanagara empire were successful in defeating the Deccan Sultanates in the [[Lepakshi]] region (Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border region).&lt;ref name="Stein1989p84"/&gt; After the collapse of the Vijayanagara empire, the Lingayat Keladi/Ikkeri dynasty ruled the coastal Karnataka till the invasion and their defeat by Hyder Ali seeking a Mysore-based Sultanate.&lt;ref name=shastry1982/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kodancha Gujjadi Vasantha Madhava|title=Western Karnataka: Its Agrarian Relations A.D. 1500-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0AaAAAAIAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Navrang|isbn=978-81-7013-073-4|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caste status debates (19th–20th century)===
In early decades of the 19th-century, the Lingayats were described by British officials such as Francis Buchanan as a conglomeration of Hindu castes with enormous diversity and eclectic, egalitarian social system that accepted converts from all social strata and religions.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|pp=78-81}} However, the British officials also noted the endogamous tradition and hereditary occupations of many Lingayats, which made their classification difficult.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|pp=81-84}} In the 1871 and the 1881 colonial era census of British India, Lingayats were listed as ''[[shudras]]''.{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=143}}{{refn|group=note|According to S.M. Jamdar, "who is spearheading the demand" in 2017/2018 for recognition of Lingayats as a separate religion, and M.B.

N.

After being placed in the shudra category in the 1881 census, Lingayats demanded a higher caste status.{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=143}} This was objected and ridiculed by a Brahmin named Ranganna who said that Lingayats were not Shaiva Brahmins given their eclectic occupations that included washermen, traders, agriculture and others, as well as their exogamous relationships with the royal family.{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=144}} Lingayats persisted in their claims for decades,{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=143}} and their persistence was strengthened by Lingayat presence within the government, and a growing level of literacy and employment in journalism and the judiciary.{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=145}} In 1926, the Bombay High Court ruled that "the Veerashaivas are not Shudras."{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=145, note 7}}

According to Schouten, in the early 20th century Lingayats tried to raise their social status, by stressing the specific characteristics of their history and of their religious thought as being distinctive from the Brahmin-dominated Hindu-culture.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=16}} In the 1910s, the narrative of Basava and Allama as the "founding pillars" of the Lingayats gained new importance for the identity of parts of the Lingayat-community, with other parts responded with rejection of this "resurrection."{{sfn|Bairy|2013|p=145}}

===Separate religious identity (21st century)===
According to Ramanujan, "A modern attempt was made to show Lingayats as having a religion separate from Hindu when Lingayats received discrete entry in the Indian constitution of 1950."{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=175}}&lt;ref name=thehindu2000 group=web/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt; Individuals and community leaders have made intermittent claims for the legal recognition of either being distinct from Hinduism or a caste within Hinduism.{{refn|group=note|name=separate_identity|Separate identity:&lt;br&gt;* Ramanuja (1973): "A modern attempt was made to show Lingayats as having a religion separate from Hindu when Lingayats received discrete entry in the Indian constitution of 1950.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=175}}&lt;br&gt;* The Hindu (Dec. 11, 2000): "Mallaradhya, who became a prominent politician after his retirement from the IAS, had laid claim to the non-Hindu tag in the mid-Seventies at a time when the Devaraj Urs government had appointed the First Karnataka Backward Class Commission, headed by Mr. L.G.Havanur."&lt;ref name=thehindu2000 group=web/&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Encyclopedia Britannica: "In the early 21st century some Lingayats began to call for legal recognition by the Indian government as a religion distinct from Hinduism or, alternatively, as a caste within Hinduism."&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt;}}

In 2000, the ''Akhila Bharatha [All India] Veerashaiva Mahasabha'' started a campaign for recognition of "Veerashaivas or Lingayats" as a non-Hindu religion, and a separate listing in the Census.

==Characteristics==
Lingayatism is often considered a Hindu sect.{{sfn|Levinson|Christensen|2002|p=475}}{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=175}}&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt;{{refn|group=note|name=Hindu_sect|Hindu sect:&lt;br&gt;* Encyclopedia Britannica: "Lingayat, also called Virashaiva, member of a Hindu sect"&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt;&lt;br&gt;* Levinson &amp; Christensen (2002): "The Lingayats are a Hindu sect"{{sfn|Levinson|Christensen|2002|p=475}}}} because it shares beliefs with Indian religions,{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=175}}{{refn|group=note|name=shared_beliefs|Shared beliefs:&lt;br&gt;Ramanujan (1973): "But we believe Lingayats to be Hindus because their beliefs are syncretistic and include an assemblage of many Hindu elements, including the name of their god, Shiva, who is one of the chief figures of the Hindu pantheon."}} and "their [Lingayats] beliefs are syncretistic and include an assemblage of many Hindu elements, including the name of their god, Shiva, who is one of the chief figures of the Hindu pantheon."{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=175}} Its worship is centred on [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] as the universal god in the iconographic form of ''Ishtalinga''.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=208-209}}{{refn|group=note|name=Dalal_linga}} They believe that they will be reunited with Shiva after their death by wearing the ''lingam''.{{sfn|Sinha|Saraswati|1978|p=107}}

===Ishtalinga===
[[File:Akkamahadevi Udathadi1.JPG|thumb|right|An idol of [[Akka Mahadevi]] holding ''Ishta Linga'' in her left hand]]

Lingayatism worship is centred on the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] as the universal god in the iconographic form of ''Ishtalinga''.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=208-209}}{{refn|group=note|name=Dalal_linga}} The Lingayats always wear the ''Ishtalinga'' held with a necklace.&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt; The Istalinga is made up of small blue-black stone coated with fine durable thick black paste of cow dung ashes mixed with some suitable oil to withstand wear and tear. The ''Ishtalinga'' is a symbolism for Lord Shiva.&lt;ref name=EB_Lingayat group=web/&gt; It is viewed as a "living, moving" divinity with the Lingayat devotee. Everyday, the devotee removes this personal linga from its box, places it in left palm, offers puja and then meditates about becoming one with the linga, in his or her journey towards the ''atma-linga''.&lt;ref name="WaghorneCutler1996p184"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joanne Punzo Waghorne|author2=Norman Cutler|author3=Vasudha Narayanan|title=Gods of Flesh, Gods of Stone: The Embodiment of Divinity in India |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LD91JTIl8uIC&amp;pg=PA184 |year=1996|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-10777-8|pages=184 note 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soteriology===

====Shatsthala====
Lingayatism teaches a path to an individual's spiritual progress, and describes it as a six-stage ''Satsthalasiddhanta''. This concept progressively evolves:{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10}}
* the individual starts with the phase of a devotee, 
* the phase of the master, 
* the phase of the receiver of grace, 
* Linga in life breath (god dwells in his or her soul), 
* the phase of surrender (awareness of no distinction in god and soul, self), 
* the last stage of complete union of soul and god (liberation, [[moksha|mukti]]).

Thus bhakti progresses from external icon-aided loving devotional worship of Shiva to deeper fusion of awareness with abstract Shiva, ultimately to advaita (oneness) of one's soul and god for ''moksha''.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10, 111-112}}

====Mukti====
While they accept the concept of transmigration of soul (metempsychosis, reincarnation),{{sfn|Curta|Holt|2016|p=575}} they believe that Lingayats are in their last lifetime,{{sfn|Curta|Holt|2016|p=575}}{{sfn|Malik|0000|p=263}} and believe that will be reunited with Shiva after their death by wearing the ''lingam''.{{sfn|Sinha|Saraswati|1978|p=107}}{{sfn|Curta|Holt|2016}}{{sfn|Malik|0000|p=263}} Lingayats are not cremated, but "are buried in a sitting, meditative position, holding their personal linga in the right hand."{{sfn|Curta|Holt|2016}}

Indologist F. Otto Schrader was among early scholars who studied Lingayat texts and its stand on metempsychosis.&lt;ref name=schrader313/&gt; According to Schrader, it was Abbe Dubois who first remarked that Lingayatism rejects metempsychosis – the belief that the soul of a human being or animal transmigrates into a new body after death. This remark about "rejecting rebirth" was repeated by others, states Schrader, and it led to the question whether Lingayatism is a religion distinct from other Indian religions such as Hinduism where metempsychosis and rebirth is a fundamental premise.&lt;ref name=schrader313&gt;{{cite journal|author= F. Otto Schrader|title= Lingāyatas and Metempsychosis|journal= Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes|volume= 31|year= 1924| pp= 313–317|publisher= University of Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schrader, Dubois was incorrect and Lingayat texts such as ''Viramahesvaracara-samgraha'', ''Anadi-virasaivasara-samgraha'', ''Sivatattva ratnakara'' (by Basava), and ''Lingait Paramesvara Agama'' confirm that metempsychosis is a fundamental premise of Lingayatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= F. Otto Schrader|title= Lingāyatas and Metempsychosis|journal= Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes|volume= 31|year= 1924| pp= 314–315|publisher= University of Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schrader, Lingayats believe that if they live an ethical life then this will be their last life, and they will merge into Shiva, a belief that has fed the confusion that they do not believe in rebirth.&lt;ref name=schrader313/&gt; According to R. Blake Michael, rebirth and ways to end rebirth was extensively discussed by Basava, Allama Prabhu, Siddharameshawar and other religious saints of Lingayatism.{{sfn|Blake Michael|1992|pp=102-114}}

===Shiva: non-dualism and qualified monism===
{{Main|Panchachara|Ashtavarana|Shatsthala}}
[[File:Necklace with Shiva's Family LACMA M.85.140.jpg|thumb|A necklace with pendant containing linga symbol of Shiva are worn by Lingayats. [[Rudraksha]] beads (shown above) and ''Vibhuti'' (sacred ash on forehead) are other symbols adopted as a constant reminder of one's principles of faith.{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=244}}]]

====Qualified non-dualism====
''Shunya'', in a series of Kannada language texts, is equated with the Virashaiva concept of the Supreme. In particular, the ''[[Shunyasampadane|Shunya Sampadane]]'' texts present the ideas of [[Allama Prabhu]] in a form of dialogue, where ''shunya'' is that void and distinctions which a spiritual journey seeks to fill and eliminate. It is the described as state of union of one's soul with the infinite Shiva, the state of blissful moksha.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|Schuhmacher|1994|p=202}}

This Lingayat concept is similar to ''shunya Brahma'' concept found in certain texts of [[Vaishnavism]], particularly in [[Odia language|Odiya]], such as the poetic ''Panchasakhas''. It explains the ''Nirguna Brahman'' idea of Vedanta, that is the eternal unchanging metaphysical reality as "personified void". Alternate names for this concept of Hinduism, include ''shunya purusha'' and ''Jagannatha'' in certain texts.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|Das|1994|p=9, 101–112}} However, both in Lingayatism and various flavors of Vaishnavism such as ''Mahima Dharma'', the idea of ''Shunya'' is closer to the Hindu concept of metaphysical ''[[Brahman]]'', rather than to the ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' concept of Buddhism.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}} However, there is some overlap, such as in the works of Bhima Bhoi.{{sfn|Dalal|2010|p=388-389}}{{sfn|Bäumer|2010}}

Sripati, a Veerashaiva scholar, explained Lingayatism philosophy in ''Srikara Bhashya'', in [[Vedanta]] terms, stating Lingayatism to be a form of qualified non-dualism, wherein the individual [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul) is the body of God, and that there is no difference between Shiva and Atman (self, soul), Shiva is one's Atman, one's Atman is Shiva.{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=244}} Sripati's analysis places Lingayatism in a form closer to the 11th century [[Vishishtadvaita]] philosopher [[Ramanuja]], than to [[Advaita]] philosopher [[Adi Shankara]].{{sfn|Olson|2007|p=244}}

====Qualified monism====
Other scholars state that Lingayatism is more complex than the description of the Virasaiva scholar Sripati. It united diverse spiritual trends during Basava's era. Jan Peter Schouten states that it tends towards monotheism with Shiva as the godhead, but with a strong awareness of the monistic unity of the [[Brahman|Ultimate Reality]].{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10}} Schouten calls this as a synthesis of Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita and Shankara's Advaita traditions, naming it ''Shakti-Vishishtadvaita'', that is monism fused with Shakti beliefs.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=9-10}} But Basava's approach is different than [[Adi Shankara]], states Schouten, in that Basava emphasises the path of devotion, compared to Shankara's emphasis on the path of knowledge—a system of monistic [[Advaita]] philosophy widely discussed in Karnataka in the time of Basava.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=111-112}}

===Ethical conduct===

====Panchacharas====
[[File:Kudala Sangama.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kudalasangama]] in [[Bagalkot district]], a temple and pilgrimage site linked to Guru Basavanna]]

The ''Panchacharas'' describe the five codes of conduct to be followed by the Lingayats. The ''[[Panchachara]]s'' include:{{sfn|Klostermaier|2010}}
* Lingāchāra&amp;nbsp;– Daily worship of the individual Ishtalinga icon, one to three times day.
* Sadāchāra&amp;nbsp;– Attention to vocation and duty, and adherence to the seven rules of conduct issued by [[Basavanna]]:
**''kala beda'' (Do not steal)
**''kola beda'' (Do not kill or hurt)
**''husiya nudiyalu beda'' (Do not utter lies)
**''thanna bannisabeda'' (Do not praise yourself* i.e. practice humility)
**''idira haliyalu beda'' (Do not criticize others)
**''muniya beda'' (shun anger)
**''anyarige asahya padabeda'' (Do not be intolerant towards others)
* Sivāchāra&amp;nbsp;– acknowledging [[Shiva]] as the supreme divine being and upholding the equality and well-being of all human beings.
* Bhrityāchāra&amp;nbsp;– Compassion towards all creatures.
* Ganāchāra&amp;nbsp;– Defence of the community and its tenets.

====Ashtavarana====
The ''Ashtavaranas'', the eight-fold armour that shields the devotee from extraneous distraction and worldly attachments. The ''[[Ashtavarana]]s'' include:{{sfn|Klostermaier|2010}}
* [[Guru]]&amp;nbsp;– obedience towards Guru, the Mentor;
* [[Linga]]&amp;nbsp;– wearing the ''Ishtalinga'' on your body at all times;
* [[Jangama]]&amp;nbsp;– reverence for Shiva ascetics as incarnations of divinity;
* [[Pādodaka]]&amp;nbsp;– sipping the water used for bathing the Linga;
* [[Prasāda]]&amp;nbsp;– sacred offerings;
* [[Vibhuti]]&amp;nbsp;– smearing holy ash on oneself daily;
* [[Rudrāksha]]&amp;nbsp;– wearing a string of ''rudraksha'' (holy beads, seeds of [[Elaeocarpus ganitrus]]);
* [[Mantra]]&amp;nbsp;– reciting the mantra of "Namah Shivaya: (salutation to Shiva)"

====''Kāyakavē Kailāsa'' doctrine and karma====
[[File:Kailaasa.png|thumb|''Kayakave Kailasa'' in [[Kannada]]]]
''Kayakave kailasa'' is a slogan in Virasaivism. It means "work is heaven" or "to work [''Kayakave''] is to be in the Lord's Kingdom [''Kailasa'']". Some scholars translate ''Kayaka'' as "worship, ritual", while others translate it as "work, labour". The slogan is attributed to Basava, and generally interpreted to signify a work ethic for all social classes.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|p=35-36}}

Lingayat poet-saints accepted the concept of ''[[karma]]'' and repeatedly mention it in their Shiva poetry. For example, states Ramanujan, Mahadeviyakka mentions karma and resulting chain of rebirths that are cut short by bhakti to Shiva.{{sfn|Ramanujan|1973|pp=116-117 with footnote 45 on p. 194}} Lingayatism has the concepts of karma and dharma, but the Lingayatism doctrine of karma is not one of fate and destiny. Lingayats believe in ''kayaka'' (work) and the transformative potential of "one's work in the here and now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karigoudar Ishwaran|title= A Populistic Community and Modernization in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nNYUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA25|year=1977 |publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=90-04-04790-5|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schouten, Siddharama and Allama debated the doctrine of karma as the law of work and merit, but Allama persuaded Siddharama that such merit is a low level mechanism, and real mystical achievement transcends "the sphere of works and rewards" and is void of self-interest.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=105-106, 114}} These ideas, states Schouten, are similar to those found in Bhagavad Gita which teaches "work must be done without any attachment to the results".{{sfn|Schouten|1995|pp=106-107}}{{refn|group=note|According to Venugolan, the Lingayatism views on karma and free will is also found in some early texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Venugopal | first=C. N. | title=Reformist Sects and the Sociology of Religion in India | journal=Sociological Analysis | publisher=Oxford University Press | volume=51 | year=1990 | doi=10.2307/3711676 | pages=S.77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Dāsoha doctrine====
''Dasoha'' is the purpose and result of ''Kāyakavē Kailāsa'' in Lingayatism.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=111–113, 120, 140–141}} ''Dasoha'' means "service", and more specifically "service to other Lingayats" including the ''[[Jangam]]a''. Regardless of one's vocation, Lingayatism suggests giving and donating a part of one's time, effort and income to one's community and to religious mendicants.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=111–113, 120, 140–141}}{{sfn|Blake Michael|1992|p=40–45}}

According to Virasaivism, skilful work and service to one's community, without discrimination, is a means to experiencing the divine, a sentiment that continues to be revered in present-day Virasaivas.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=138–141}} According to Jan Peter Schouten, this doctrine is philosophically rooted in the more ancient [[Soham (Sanskrit)|So'ham]] Sanskrit [[advaita|oneness]] mantra related to [[Shiva]], and which means "I am He".{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=113–114}} This social ethic is also found among other Hindu communities of South India, and includes community provisioning of grains and sharing other essentials particularly with poorer members of society and those affected by natural or other disasters.{{sfn|Vasavi|1999|p=71–76, 79–81}}

===Lingadharane===
''Lingadharane'' is the ceremony of initiation among Lingayats. Though ''lingadharane'' can be performed at any age, it is usually performed when a fetus in the womb is 7–8 months old. The family Guru performs [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]] and provides the ishtalinga to the mother, who then ties it to her own ishtalinga until birth. At birth the mother secures the new ishtalinga to her child. Upon attaining the age of 8–11 years, the child receives ''[[Diksha]]'' from the family Guru to know the proper procedure to perform pooja of ishtalinga. From birth to death, the child wears the Linga at all times and it is worshipped as a personal ishtalinga. The ''Linga'' is wrapped in a cloth housed in a small silver and wooden box. It is to be worn on the chest, over the seat of the indwelling deity within the heart. Some people wear it on the chest or around the body using a thread.

===Vegetarianism===
Lingayats are strict [[vegetarian]]s. Devout Lingayats do not consume beef, or meat of any kind including fish.{{sfn|Ishwaran|1983|p=119–120}} The drinking of [[alcohol]] is prohibited.&lt;ref name=cultural.maharashtra.gov group=web/&gt;

===Militancy===
The early Lingayat literature, including the Basava Purana, highly praises militant action against anyone who persecutes a fellow Lingayat or their ability to practice their Shiva-bhakti traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sivalingayya Channabasavayya Nandimath|title=A handbook of Vīraśaivism|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4w0aAAAAMAAJ|year =1979|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ishwaran pp. 72–82"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ishwaran | first=K. | title=Bhakti Tradition and Modernization: The Case of Lingayatism | journal=African and Asian Studies | publisher=Brill | volume=15 | issue=1 | year=1980 | doi=10.1163/156852180x00068 | pages=72–82}}, Quote: "From the point of view of the emergence of Lingayatism as a militant religious movement, the reign of one of these kings of Karnataka, Bijjala II (1100-1167) is significant.

However, states Schouten, the early texts of Lingayats give different accounts on who ordered the assassination leading to doubts about the trustworthiness of these historic texts.{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=5 with footnote 3}}

===Temples and rites-of-passage===
Virashaivas believe that the human body is a temple. In addition, they have continued to build the community halls and Shaiva temple traditions of South India. Their temples include Shiva linga in the sanctum, a sitting Nandi facing the linga, with mandapa and other features. However, the prayers and offerings are not led by [[Brahmin]] priests but by Lingayat priests.&lt;ref name="Srinivas1998p42"/&gt; The temple format is simpler than those of Jains and Hindus found in north Karnataka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Julia A.

===Lingayat literature===
[[File:Akkamahadevi Vachana2.JPG|thumb|right|A vachana (poem) by [[Akka Mahadevi]]]]
Several works are attributed to the founder of Lingayatism movement, Basava, and these texts are revered in the Lingayat community. In particular, these include various ''Vachana'' (literally, "what is said"){{sfn|Olson|2007|p=239–240}} such as the ''Shat-sthala-vachana'', ''Kala-jnana-vachana'', ''Mantra-gopya'', ''Ghatachakra-vachana'' and ''Raja-yoga-vachana''.{{sfn|Rice|1982|p=53–54}} Saints and Sharanas like Allamaprabhu, Akka Mahadevi, [[Siddarama]] and Basava were at the forefront of this development during the 12th century.

Other important Lingayat literature includes:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
* [[Shunyasampadane]]
* [[Mantra Gopya]]
* [[Shunyasampadane|Shunya Sampadane]]
* [[Karana Hasuge]]

The ''[[Basava Purana]]'', a Telugu biographical epic poem which narrates the life story of Basava, was written by [[Palkuriki Somanatha]] in 13th-century, and an updated 14th century Kannada version was written by [[Bhima Kavi]] in 1369. Both are sacred texts in Lingayatism.{{sfn|Rao|Roghair|2014|p=21–23}}

===Vedas and shastras===
Lingayat (Veerashaiva) thinkers rejected the custodial hold of Brahmins over the [[Veda]]s and the [[shastra]]s, but they did not outright reject the Vedic knowledge.{{sfn|Prasad|2012|p=104}}{{sfn|Rao|Roghair|2014|p=7}}{{sfn|Rao|Roghair|2014|p=7}} The 13th-century Telugu Virashaiva poet [[Palkuriki Somanatha]], author of [[Basava Purana]]—a scripture of Veerashaivas, for example asserted, "Virashaivism fully conformed to the [[Vedas]] and the shastras."{{sfn|Prasad|2012|p=104}}{{sfn|Rao|Roghair|2014|p=7-8}} Somanatha repeatedly stated that "he was a scholar of the four Vedas".{{sfn|Rao|Roghair|2014|p=7}}

Lingayatism considers the Vedas as a means, but not the sanctimonious end.{{sfn|McCormack|1963}} It rejected various forms of ritualism and the uncritical adherence to any text including the Vedas.{{sfn|Ishwaran|1980|p=72-76}}

===Anubhava Mantapa===
The ''Anubhava Mantapa'' literally means the "hall of spiritual experience".{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=1-5}} It has been a Lingayat institution since the time of Basava, serving as an academy of mystics, saints and poet-philosophers for discussion of spiritual and mundane questions of life, in open.{{sfn|Das|2005|p=161-163}} It was the fountainhead of all religious and philosophical thought pertaining to the Lingayata. It was presided over by the mystic Allamaprabhu, and numerous sharanas from all over Karnataka and other parts of India were participants. This institution also helped propagate Lingayatism religious and philosophical thought. Akka Mahadevi, Channabasavanna and Basavanna himself were participants in the [[Anubhava Mantapa]].{{sfn|Schouten|1995|p=1-5}}

==Demographics==
Lingayats today are found predominantly in the state of [[Karnataka]], especially in North and Central Karnataka with a sizeable population native to South Karnataka. Lingayats have been estimated to be about 20% of Karnataka's population.{{sfn|Levinson|Christensen|2002|p=475}}{{refn|group=note|Levinson &amp; Christensen (2002): "The Lingayats are a Hindu sect concentrated in the state of Karnataka (a southern provincial state of India), which covers 191,773 square kilometres. The Lingayats constitute around 20 percent of the total population in that state."{{sfn|Levinson|Christensen|2002|p=475}}}}
&amp; in the state of Maharastra forming for about 9% of state population.

Significant populations are also found in parts of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] bordering Karnataka, as well as [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Gujarat]]. The Lingayat diaspora can be found in countries around the world, particularly the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=Economist_2017_medievalpoet group=web/&gt;

Today, the Lingayat community is a blend of various [[caste]]s, consisting of [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|SC]], [[Other Backward Class|OBC]], [[working class]]es and various [[Vaishya]] castes, that have come together to form the single political entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/mar/23/lingayat-scs-obcs-may-not-welcome-minority-tag-1791248.html|title=Lingayat SCs, OBCs may not welcome minority tag|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taiwan Grand Shrine.jpg|thumb|[[Taiwan Grand Shrine]] was the most notable Shinto shrine in Taiwan. Unfortunately it was destroyed by conflagration in 1944 when a [[cargo plane]] crashed in its vicinity. Today the [[Grand Hotel (Taipei City)|Grand Hotel]] stands in its place.]]
[[Image:Yoshihisa Kitasirakawanomiya.jpg|thumb|Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa.]]

On June 17, 1895&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.twhistory.org.tw/20010618.htm | title = Japanese-era "Dominion Day" | publisher = Taiwan History Association (臺灣歷史學會)| author = Tsai Chin-tang (蔡錦堂) |date= 2001-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Meiji period|Meiji]] 28), [[Taiwan]] came under the rule of the [[Empire of Japan]]. In the following year on December 3, 1896,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dcc.ndhu.edu.tw/trans/dilcis/query2/browse.php?itemno=16 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120707111202/http://dcc.ndhu.edu.tw/trans/dilcis/query2/browse.php?itemno=16 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-07 | script-title = zh:運動休閒歷史事件 | publisher = Digital Culture Center, National Dong Hwa University | language = zh }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Shinto shrine]] was created in Taiwan. This was actually an already existing {{Interlanguage link multi|Koxinga Shrine|zh|3=延平郡王祠}} located in [[Tainan]] but renamed {{nihongo|[[Kaizan Shrine]]|開山神社}}.

Since then, Shinto shrines were built in the major cities between the Meiji and [[Taishō period]], while the majority of Shinto shrines in Taiwan were built from the late 1930s until Japan's defeat in World War II. In total, 204 shrines were built in Taiwan–66 of which were officially sanctioned by the Japanese Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://big5.chinataiwan.org/web/webportal/W5268122/Uzhanglx/A229786.html | script-title = zh:台灣神社 | publisher = 中國台灣網 | date = April 6, 2006 | language = zh | title = Archived copy | access-date = 2007-04-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070410125055/http://big5.chinataiwan.org/web/webportal/W5268122/Uzhanglx/A229786.html | archive-date = 2007-04-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many shrines in the {{nihongo4|exterior territories|外地|gaichi}} such as [[Hokkaidō]] had {{nihongo4|enshrined deities|祭神|Saijin}} such as the {{nihongo4|Three Kami Deities of Cultivation|開拓三神|Kaitaku Sanjin}} which consisted of {{nihongo4||大国魂命|Ōkunitama no Mikoto}}, {{nihongo4||大己貴命|[[Ōkuninushi|Ōnamuchi no Mikoto]]}} and {{nihongo4||少彦名命|Sukunahikona no Mikoto}}; the Sun Goddess [[Amaterasu]]; [[Meiji Emperor]] etc., in Taiwan, most shrines had [[Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa|Prince Yoshihisa]] as a ''Saijin''. Prince Yoshihisa was sent to Taiwan to subjugate the [[Japanese Invasion of Taiwan (1895)|anti-Japanese rebellion]] but fell ill and died from [[malaria]] in Tainan in 1895. This fate was so similar to that of the legendary Prince [[Yamato Takeru]] that Prince Yoshihisa was made a {{nihongo4|[[tutelary deity]]|鎮護の神|chingo no kami}} of Taiwan. In 1901 (Meiji 34), the Taiwan Shrine (later [[Taiwan Grand Shrine]]) was built and Prince Yoshihisa along with the Three Kami Deities of Cultivation were enshrined. Amaterasu was later included in the shrine. The shrines in Taiwan followed in its lead and Prince Yoshihisa became a ''Saijin'' in most shrines throughout Taiwan. Furthermore, in [[Tainan]], the place of Prince Yoshihisa's demise, the [[Tainan Shrine]] was built.

After Japan's defeat in World War II, the shrines were either abandoned, destroyed or converted into Chinese Martyr Shrines.

==List of shrines==
Below is a list of Shinto shrines which were built during Japanese colonial rule. The shrines were ranked according to their importance such as Grand Shrine (官幣大社 ''kokuhei taisha''), Small Shrine (国幣小社 ''kokuhei shōsha'') and Martyr Shrine (護国神社 ''gokoku jinja''), the last of which was designated by the [[Governor-General of Taiwan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13633">There have been various notable [[prediction]]s made throughout history, including those by [[scientists]] based on the [[scientific method]], predictions of [[social]] and [[technological]] change of [[futurologists]], [[Economic forecasting|economic forecasts]], religious [[prophecy|prophecies]] and the fictional imaginings of [[author]]s and [[science fiction]]. Science fiction author [[Arthur C. Clarke]] wrote [[Clarke's three laws|three laws of prediction]].

{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}

==Economic forecasting==
{{Main|Economic forecasting}}
* In 1987, [[Ravi Batra]] predicted an economic depression in his best-selling book, ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]].'' He subsequently wrote other books on surviving economic upheaval.
* In 1996, economist [[Alan Greenspan]] famously stated that there was [[irrational exuberance]] in the stock market on Dec 5, 1996, and indeed, may well have contributed to it as a result of his policies as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. His warning went unheeded and the stock market continued to boom in the late 1990s until the stock market downturn of 2000 and 2001, when it became evident that the warning had been correct.

==Scientific prediction==
{{Main|Prediction}}
* The existence of [[Neptune]] was predicted through [[mathematical model]]ling based on [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of gravity]]
* [[Radio waves]] were predicted by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]
* [[Final anthropic principle]] - highly contentious prediction bordering on [[philosophy]]
* [[Antimatter]] was predicted by [[Paul Dirac]] on the basis of his formulation of [[relativistic quantum mechanics]].
* [[Unipolarity]] was predicted by [[Fichte]] on the basis of his analysis of the challenge of [[Napoleon]] and by [[K'ang Yu-wei]] on the basis of the macro-historical trend and global closure.
* The [[Cold War]] was predicted by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] on the basis of the expansion of Russia and America.
* [[World Wars]] were predicted by [[K'ang Yu-wei]] and George [[Vacher de Lapouge]] on the basis of the macro-historical trend and global closure.
* American [[unipolarity]] was predicted by George [[Vacher de Lapouge]] on the basis of combination of macro-historical trend, global closure and racial theory and by [[H. G. Wells]] on the basis of the development level.
* The dissolution of the [[USSR]] was predicted by [[Emmanuel Todd]] on the basis of economic and national factors.

==Futurism==
{{main|Futures studies}}
* [[Doomsday equation]] (1960): Heinz von Foerster extrapolated historical population data to predict an infinite human population for 2026.
* ''[[Future Shock]]'' (1970) by [[Alvin Toffler]]  considered change moving too fast for humans to cope.
* ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (1986) by [[K. Eric Drexler]] which involves [[molecular nanotechnology]] changing the world, and introduces the [[grey goo]] scenario.
* ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992, by [[Francis Fukuyama]]) heralded the arrival of the "end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government."  Its thesis has since been disavowed by its author.
* ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]'' by [[Samuel P. Huntington]], published in ''Foreign Affairs'', Volume 72, Number 3, Summer 1993 and later expanded into a book, states "the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. [[Nation state]]s will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future."
* ''The Coming [[technological singularity|Technological Singularity]]'' (1993, by [[Vernor Vinge]]) - a prediction of imminent acceleration of progress caused by increasing speed of computers and developments in AI.
* ''An Illustrated Speculative Timeline of Future Technology and Social Change'' (1993-2008, by J.R. Mooneyham)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrmooneyham.com/future_history_timeline.html How advances in technology may reshape humanity an illustrated speculative timeline of future technology and social change&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.jrmooneyham.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ray Kurzweil]] is concerned with the idea of the [[Technological singularity|singularity]] and many more optimistic technological and transhumanist predictions.
* "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]" (April 2000) - an essay warning about the dangers of [[robotics]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[nanotechnology]] to humanity. The essay has achieved wide exposure because of [[Bill Joy]]'s prominence.
* [[Arthur C. Clarke]]:
{{blockquote|No one can see into the future. What I try to do is outline possible "futures" - although totally expected inventions or events can render predictions absurd after only a few years. The classic example is the statement, made in the late 1940s, by the then chairman of IBM that the world market for computers was five. I have more than that in my own office.

Perhaps I am in no position to criticise: in 1971 I predicted the first Mars Landing in 1994; now we'll be lucky if we make it by 2010. On the other hand, I thought I was being wildly optimistic in 1951 by suggesting a mission to the moon in 1978. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin beat me by almost a decade.

Still, I take pride in the fact that communications satellites are placed exactly where I suggested in 1945, and the name "Clarke Orbit" is often used (if only because it's easier to say than "geostationary orbit").

Some of the event listed here, particularly the space missions, are already scheduled. I believe all the other events could happen, although several, I hope, will not. Check me for accuracy - on December 31, 2000.|&lt;ref name=Predictions&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke|first=Arthur C.|title=Sir Arthur C. Clarke's Predictions|url=http://www.arthurcclarke.net/?scifi=3|publisher=Readers Digest|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Visions of the World to Come''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpi.edu/News/Events/Future/transcript.pdf Imagining the Future]&lt;/ref&gt; (November 2001, by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]) - Clarke presents a speculative timeline of the 21st century.}}
* ''Tomorrow Now: Imagining the Next 50 Years'' by [[Bruce Sterling]] in 2002. A popular science approach on futurology, reflecting technology, politics and culture of the next 50 years.
* ''[[Our Final Hour]]'' by [[Martin Rees]] in 2003. The book presents the notion that the Earth and human survival are in far greater danger from the potential effects of modern technology than is commonly realised. Hence the 21st century may be a critical moment in history when humanity's fate is decided. Rees gained controversy, and notoriety, by estimating that the probability of [[Human extinction|extinction]] before 2100 AD is around 50%. This is based on the possibility of malign or accidental release of destructive technology and gained some attention as he is a well-regarded [[astronomer]].
* ''[[Dark Age Ahead]]'' by [[Jane Jacobs]] in 2004. As it implies the book warns of a pessimistic future, in this case caused by a decay in science, community, and education.

* ''[[Looking Backward|Looking Backward: 2000-1887]]'' was written by [[Edward Bellamy]] in 1888. The novel imagined that by 2000, the United States would be a socialist [[utopia]], with far shorter work weeks for menial laborers and far greater leisure time for all workers. His novel predicted things such as skyscrapers, debit cards, and a device used to hear and view concerts in the home that resembles a modern television.
* ''[[The Population Bomb]]'' by [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] in 1968 predicted disasters due to [[Neo-Malthusian]] concerns.
* ''[[Limits to Growth|The Limits to Growth]]'' (1972, by [[Club of Rome]]) was often erroneously accused of predicting the inevitable exhaustion of [[natural resources]].

* ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1948, by [[George Orwell]]) - a [[dystopia]]n book set in Oceania, a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] that emerged in the [[Americas]] and the [[British Empire]]. The book extrapolates the reality of contemporary [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] Russia and [[Nazi Germany]]. The main [[protagonist]] is [[Winston Smith]] whose job involves supporting the [[historical revisionism]] and [[propaganda]] of the [[political regime]]. Many original concepts from the book, such as [[doublethink]], [[thought crime]] and [[newspeak]] have since entered popular consciousness.
* [[Foundation series]] by [[Isaac Asimov]]. The new science of [[psychohistory]] can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.
* The author [[H.G. Wells]] wrote several works predicting future scientific advances and often exploring the problems technology cause humanity. He was especially adept at predicting the future role of airplanes in warfare. His 1901 book, ''Anticipations'' imagined trains, cars, sexual freedom, and [[eugenics]]. In ''[[The World Set Free]]'', published in 1914, he eerily predicted the creation of the atom bomb. His 1933 work, ''Shape of Things to Come'', foresaw the extensive use of aerial bombardment in warfare. This was later adapted into the widely seen and critically important [[Alexander Korda]] science fiction film ''[[Things to Come]]''.
* ''[[Paris in the Twentieth Century]]'' is a science fiction novel by [[Jules Verne]] written in 1863 that features detailed descriptions of a world of glass skyscrapers, high-speed trains, automobiles, calculators, and a worldwide communications network.

'''Marxist ethics''' is a doctrine of [[morality]], i.e. [[ethics]] that is based on, or derived from, [[Marxist philosophy]]. [[Marxism–Leninism]] believes that morality, like other forms of [[ideology]], is of a class character and is manifested in people’s behaviour in different ways in different historical conditions in accordance with the interests of what classes or social strata a person advocates.&lt;ref&gt;"What is What? A Concise Dictionary of Social and Political Terms." Translated from the Russian by Margaret Webley. Compiled by Sofia Kholod. Moscow: [[Progress Publishers]], 1988, {{ISBN|5-01-000448-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}

The main methodological principles of Marxist ethics are [[materialism]] and [[dialectics]]. Marxist–Leninist ethics is materialist: the ideals, standards and virtues prevailing in society are interpreted as a reflection of actually existing interpersonal (value) relations, an expression of interests and requirements of social groups and classes. Morality is not reduced to an ethical ideology that has isolated itself from the world and lays claim to absolute value. Marxist ethics describes morality as a property of man’s behaviour conditioned by his social and historical existence as those moral values that bring together (or force apart) living individuals. 

Marxist–Leninist ethics is dialectical, i.e. it maintains that like morality as a whole, each of its manifestations, each standard and virtue, is in perpetual motion, emerging, developing, disappearing, passing from one qualitative state to another. Torn out of the concrete historical process, morality in general simply does not exist. Each type of morality is socially and historically conditioned—this is the fundamental tenet of Marxist ethics. The objective core of morality conveys the character of definite [[social relations]]—relations of ownership of the [[means of production]], interaction of the various classes and social groups and the forms of distribution and exchange. It follows from this that morality has class content. If the nature of social bonds determines the essence of morality (and in a class society these bonds manifest themselves, first and foremost, in the relations between classes), then the morality reflecting them has a class stamp.

== History ==

The [[Muslim Students' Association of Hawaii]] was originally composed of students from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. They were members of the [[East West Center]] and came from various parts of the world: [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and from the [[Middle East]]. They prayed at a cottage in the East West center prior to the purchase of the Manoa building, which became the Muslim Association of Hawaii in 1990.  It was the first organization to represent Hawaii's Muslim population. [[Mohammad Asad Khan]] was a founding member of the Muslim Students' Association.&lt;ref name ="islam2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Muslim Association of Hawai’i – The History of the Muslim Association of Hawai’i|url=https://islaminpacific.wordpress.com/2012/01/16/the-muslim-association-of-hawaii-the-history-of-the-muslim-association-of-hawaii/|accessdate=March 16, 2017|date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the MSA [[incorporation (association)|incorporated]] becoming the first official organization to represent Muslims in Hawaii.&lt;ref name ="islam2012"/&gt;
The group helped form the mosque, which is near the [[University of Hawaii]].&lt;ref name ="islam2012"/&gt;
The majority of Muslim converts in Hawaii are military personnel.

== Financial support ==
In 2011, it was reported that the organization receives funds from Prince [[Abdulaziz Bin Fahad Al-Faisal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] and that Ouansafi said, “foreign money ... come(s) with strings attached.”&lt;ref name="Walden2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walden|first1=Andrew|title=Hakim “Islam Day” Ouansafi to Direct Hawaii Public Housing Agency|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/5668/Hakim-Islam-Day-Ouansafi-to-Direct-Hawaii-Public-Housing-Agency.aspx|website=Hawaii Free Press|accessdate=March 16, 2017|date=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents ==
In 2010, [[Abdel Hameed Shehadeh]], freshman at [[Kapiolani Community College]] was arrested for devising a plan to travel to [[Pakistan]] to join the [[Taliban]] or a similar [[terrorist]] group. The student was pursuing a liberal arts degree and frequented the Hawaii Islamic center to worship.

'''Pawnee mythology''' is the body of [[oral history]], cosmology, and myths of the [[Pawnee people]] concerning their gods and heroes.  The Pawnee are a [[federally recognized tribe]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], originally located on the [[Great Plains]] along tributaries of the [[Missouri]] and [[Platte River|Platte]] Rivers in [[Nebraska]] and [[Kansas]] and now are currently in [[Oklahoma]]. They traditionally speak [[Pawnee language|Pawnee]], a [[Caddoan]] language. The Pawnees lived in villages of [[earth lodge]]s. They grew corn and went on long bison hunts on the open plains twice a year. The tribe has four bands: the Skidi and "the South Bands" consisted of the Chawi, the Kitkahahki and the Pitahawirata Pawnee.

There were some differences in the mythology of the Skidi and the South Bands.&lt;ref name=MurieII&gt;Murie, James R. (1981b): "Ceremonies of the Pawnee. Part II. The South Bands." ''Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology''. No. 27. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|465}} The Skidis were "the great star specialists",&lt;ref name=MurieII/&gt;{{rp|465}} with a belief system focusing on visible objects on the night sky. Stars east of the Milky Way were regarded as male gods, while the female powers reigned in the western sky.&lt;ref name=MurieI&gt;Murie, James R. (1981a): "Ceremonies of the Pawnee. Part I. The Skiri." ''Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology''. No. 27. Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40}} The South Bands acknowledged the creative powers of some celestial objects and meteorological phenomena, but largely counted upon animals for support and guidance.&lt;ref name=MurieII/&gt;{{rp|186}}

==Deities and spirit animals==
Atius Tirawa, which means "Father Above" in the Pawnee language (often translated, inaccurately, as "Great Spirit"),&lt;ref name="Tirawa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.native-languages.org/morelegends/tirawa.htm |title=Legendary Native American Figures: Tirawa (Atius Tirawa)|website=http://www.native-languages.org/home.htm |accessdate=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the [[creator god]]. Other terms used, and perhaps most used, are Tirawahat or Tirawahut.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|38 and 179}} &lt;ref name=Blaine1990&gt;Blaine, Martha R. (1990): ''Pawnee Passage, 1870-1875''. Norman and London.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}} He was believed to have taught the Pawnee people [[tattoo]]ing, fire-building, hunting, agriculture, speech and clothing, religious rituals (including the use of [[tobacco]] and sacred bundles), and sacrifices. He was associated with most natural phenomena, including stars and planets, wind, lightning, rain, and thunder. The wife of Tirawa was [[Atira (goddess)|Atira]], goddess of the Earth. Atira (literally, Mother Corn) was associated with corn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atira|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/atira.php|work=The Dinner Party|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male Morning Star in the East was believed to be created first. Being the [[war god]]&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|158}} he wore the dress of a warrior.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|38}} After him came the female Evening Star in the West.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|39}} She resisted the divine plan to create humankind. Morning Star had to fight and overcome a number of forces in the western sky with his fireball&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|126}} to finally mate with her. The first human being thus created was a girl.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Six major stars represented other gods controlled by Tirawahut. Two of them were the female Southwest and Northwest Stars. The male stars were the North, the Northeast, the Southeast and the South Stars. Some had specific tasks to fulfill:
*The North Star was the son of South Star. He watched over the people and had to [[Polaris|keep his post]].&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|40}}
*Northeast Star (or Big Black Meteoric Star) controlled the animals, in particular the bison. He was also in charge of the shift from day to night.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|39}} According to some Skidis, this unidentified and enigmatic star was a buffalo bull carrying the heaven on his back.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|42}} The mythology of the South Bands does not mention this god at all and only a number of the other star gods.&lt;ref name=MurieII/&gt;{{rp|465}}
*Southeast Star (or Red Star) regulated the coming of day and had authority among the animals.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|39}}
*South Star rose sometimes on the heaven to see if his son (North Star) remained on his fixed position. South Star ruled in the land of the dead. He received no prayers and no ceremony was held in his name.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|39}} Paths in the Milky Way guided the dead human beings to his dominion.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|42}}

The Thunder, the Lightning, the Cloud and the Wind were four great powers in the west. They obeyed the Evening Star. By means of constant song they generated the Earth&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|42}} on which the first girl (the child of Evening and Morning Stars) was placed.

The solar and lunar deities were Shakuru and Pah, respectively. They were the last of all gods placed in the heavens.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|41}} Their offspring was a boy, and he was put on Earth, too. Aside from this, the Sun and the Moon are of relatively minor standing in the Skidi Pawnee mythology.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|39}}

[[Meteorite]]s brought good fortune to the finders. They were seen as the children of Tirawahut sent down to Earth.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|67}}

While the Skidi Pawnee relied a great deal on the powers and the aid of stars and other objects in [[cosmos]], the South Bands came through foremost by the assistance and advice of a number of animals.&lt;ref name=MurieII/&gt;{{rp|465}} Yet, the gods in heaven existed, and the animals acted as [[intermediary|go-betweens]] when they instructed and guided the South Bands.&lt;ref name=MurieII/&gt;{{rp|186}}

The White [[Beaver]] ceremony of the Chawi served nearly the same purpose as the renewing or restarting Spring Awakening ceremony (Thunder ceremony) of the Skidi. However [[Hibernation|hibernating]] animals were revitalized through this rite rather than the renewal of corn crops.&lt;ref name=MurieII/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Tirawa conferred miraculous powers on certain animals.  These spirit animals, the ''nahurac'', would act as Tirawa's messengers and servants, and could intercede with him on behalf of the Pawnee. The nahurac had five dwellings or lodges:&lt;ref name=grinnell&gt;Grinnell, George Bird (1893).

It now lies beneath the waters of [[Waconda Reservoir]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glenelder.com/waconda_springs.htm "The History of Waconda".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825003215/http://www.glenelder.com/waconda_springs.htm |date=2010-08-25 }}  [http://www.glenelder.com/index.htm Glen Elder, Kansas.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110129001100/http://glenelder.com/Index.htm |date=2011-01-29 }}  Retrieved 2010-09-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The fifth lodge of the nahurac was known to the Pawnee as [[Guide Rock (hill)|Pahur]] (/pa'hur/, translated as "hill that points the way" or "guide rock").&lt;ref name=grinnell /&gt;{{rp|xxi, 359}}

==Celestial observation==
The Pawnee seasonal rituals were tied to the observation of the stars and planets. Their earthwork lodges were built at the same time as observatories and as "microcosm" (scale-model of the universe).
Each lodge "was at the same time the universe and also the womb of a woman, and the household activities represented her reproductive powers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-16v2uEgO6EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Gene+Weltfish&amp;hl=de&amp;ei=H6fOTc-aKcfHtAbrqsipCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Weltfish, ''The Lost Universe: Pawnee Life and Culture''], Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, 1965; reprint 1977, p 64&lt;/ref&gt; 
The lodge also represented the universe in a more practical way. The physical construction of the house required setting up four posts to represent the four [[cardinal directions]], "aligned almost exactly with the north&amp;ndash;south, east&amp;ndash;west axis."&lt;ref&gt;Patricia J. O'Brien, "Prehistoric evidence of Pawnee Cosmology", ''American Anthropologist'' (New Series) Vol. 88, No. 4 (Dec 1986), pp 939–946&lt;/ref&gt;
A Pawnee observatory-lodge also required an  unobstructed view of the eastern sky. The lodge's axis would be oriented east&amp;ndash;west in such a way that the sunrise of [[vernal equinox]] would cast light on the altar. The dimensions of the lodge's smoke hole and door would be designed to allow observation of the sky, e.g. with the smoke-hole aligned to enable observation of the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;'Weltfish, p. 942&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one Skidi-band Pawnee man at the beginning of the twentieth century, "The Skidi were organized by the stars; these powers above made them into families and villages, and taught them how to live and how to perform their ceremonies.  The shrines of the four leading villages were given by the four leading stars and represent those stars which guide and rule the people."&lt;ref&gt;Alice C. Fletcher, "Star Cult among the Pawnee: A Preliminary Report",  ''American Anthropologist'' (New Series)  Vol 4, No 4 (Oct 1902), pp. 730–736&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular ceremonies were performed before major events, such as semi-annual [[American Bison|buffalo]] hunts. Kawaha, an often-besought god of good luck, was closely connected to buffalo hunts.&lt;ref name=MurieII/&gt;{{rp|71–72}} Many other important activities of the year were started with a ceremony, such as sowing seeds in the spring and harvesting in the fall .

The most important ceremony of the Pawnee culture, the Spring Awakening ceremony, was meant to awaken the earth and ready it for planting. It can be tied to celestial observation, held at the time when the priest first tracked "two small twinkling stars known as the Swimming Ducks in the northeastern horizon near the [[Milky Way]]." and then heard a rolling thunder from the West.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|14 and 53}} (See above for the role of Thunder in the [[Creation myth]]).&lt;ref&gt;"The position of the stars was an important guide to the time when this ceremony should be held.  The earth-lodge served as an astronomical observatory and as the priests sat inside at the west, they could observe the stars in certain positions through the smokehole and through the long east-oriented entranceway.  They also kept careful watch of the horizon right after sunset and just before dawn to note the order and position of the stars." Weltfish,   p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The Morning Star ceremony was a ritual [[human sacrifice]] of a young girl, performed only by a single village (Village Across a Hill)&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|32}} of the [[Skidi]] band of the Pawnee.  It was connected to the Pawnee creation narrative, in which the mating of the male Morning Star with the female Evening Star created the first human being, a girl.
 
The Skidi Pawnee practiced the Morning Star ritual regularly, although seemingly not annually,&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|14}}  through the 1810s. In June 1818, the ''Missouri Gazette'' reported a sacrifice "some time ago". The newborn of a captive [[Comanche]] woman was sacrificed after the woman herself had managed to escape on a stolen horse.&lt;ref name=Thurman1983&gt;Thurman, Melburn D.: "The Timing of the Skidi-Pawnee Morning Star Sacrafice." ''Ethnohistory'', Vol. 30 (1983), No. 3, pp. 155-163.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}} However, two members of the [[Long Expedition]] in 1820 believed that the young Pawnee man [[Petalesharo]] had rescued the Comanche girl. Edwin James gave the year for this action as 1817, while John R. Bell placed it around 1815.&lt;ref name=Thurman1983/&gt;{{rp|159}}

US [[Indian agents]] sought to convince chiefs to suppress the ritual,&lt;ref name=Jones1969&gt;Jones, Dorothy V.: "John Dougherty and the Pawnee Rite of Human Sacrifice: April, 1827." ''Missouri Historical Review'', Vol. 63 (1969), pp. 293-316.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|294}} and major leaders, such as Knife Chief and his relative Petalesharo or Man Chief,&lt;ref name=Jones1969/&gt;{{rp|294–295}} worked to change the practices objected to by the increasing number of American settlers on the Plains. An additional aim of the agents could have been to protect the [[fur trade]] by reducing intertribal animosity.&lt;ref name=Thurman1970a&gt;Thurman, Melburn D.: "The Skidi Pawnee Morning Star Sacrifice of 1827." ''Nebraska History''. 1970, pp. 268-280.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|276}}&lt;ref name=Thurman1983/&gt;{{rp|161}}

The custom came to the wider attention of the public in the Eastern United States in 1820 due to reports of a young Pawnee warrior, Man Chief, who risked his life to rescue a Comanche girl from the sacrificial scaffold in defiance of the Skidi Pawnee priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Weltfish, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Agent John Dougherty and some influential Pawnees tried without luck to save the life of a [[Cheyenne]] girl before mid-April&amp;nbsp;1827.&lt;ref name=Jones1969/&gt; The last known sacrifice was of Haxti, a 14-year-old [[Oglala Lakota]] girl on April 22, 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Hyde (historian)|Hyde, George]]. ''The Pawnee Indians''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1974. {{ISBN|0-8061-2094-0}}
 pp. 19–359&lt;/ref&gt; (A later stated 1833 sacrifice was confused with the one in April&amp;nbsp;1827).&lt;ref name=Thurman1970b&gt;Thurman, Melbrun D.: "A Case of Historical Mythology: The Skidi Pawnee Morning Star Sacrifice of 1833." ''Plains Anthropologist''. Vol. 50 (1970), pp. 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Identity of the Morning Star===
The identity of the Morning Star is not clear. "The earliest accounts specified [[Venus]] as Morning Star, while most ethnographers favored [[Mars]]", given it was said to be red.&lt;ref name=Thurman1983/&gt;{{rp|155}} [[Jupiter]] is also a candidate.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|41}}

During the known 1827 and 1838 ceremonies, calculations show that Venus rose on the morning sky.&lt;ref name=Thurman1983/&gt;{{rp|158}}

===Human sacrifice===
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}
The ceremony was performed  in spring, in years when "[[Mars]] was [[wikt:Special:Search/morning star|morning star]]" (see above: The identity of the Morning Star), but usually not as an actual [[human sacrifice]], but merely as a symbolic ceremony. However, one source states, "Several or more years frequently elapsed between occurrences of the Morning Star Ceremony".&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|14}} An actual human sacrifice would be performed only when a man of the village dreamed that the Morning Star had come to him and told him to perform the proper ceremony.  He would then  consult with the keeper of the Morning Star [[sacred bundle|bundle]], receiving from him a warrior costume. At the first instruction, both the visionary and the [[priest]] would cry, knowing that the mission put upon them by the Morning Star was wrong to carry out.&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|115}} The man, aided by volunteers, then had to carry out an attack on an enemy village and capture a girl of suitable age.&lt;ref&gt;"The sacrifice was performed only in years when Mars was morning star and usually originated in a dream in which the Morning Star appeared to some man and directed him to capture a suitable victim.  The dreamer went to the keeper of the Morning Star bundle and received from him the warrior's costume kept in it.  He then set out, accompanied by volunteers, and made a night attack upon an enemy village.  As soon as a girl of suitable age was captured the attack ceased and the party returned.  The girl was dedicated to the Morning Star at the moment of her capture and was given into the care of the leader of the party who, on its return, turned her over to the chief of the Morning Star." Ralph Linton, "The origin of the Pawnee Morning Star Sacrifice", ''American Anthropologist''.(New Series) Vol 28, No 3 (July 1926), pp 457–466&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to the village, the captured girl would be handed over to the servant (priest) of the Morning Star. The people in contact with the girl treated her with respect, but kept her isolated from the rest of the tribe.  When it was time for the spring sacrifice, she was [[Ritual purification|ritually cleansed]].  A five-day ceremony then began with the priest singing songs describing the advancing stages in the rite, and the girl was symbolically transformed from human to celestial form, as the ritual representation of the Evening Star. On the final day of the ceremony, a procession of men, boys and male infants carried by their mothers accompanied the girl outside the village to a [[gallows|scaffold]].&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|124}} The scaffold was made of sacred woods and skins, representing "Evening Star's garden in the west, the source of all animal and plant life."&lt;ref&gt;Linton, 1926, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;

The priests removed her clothing and she was left alone on the scaffold at the moment of the rising of the Morning Star (Mars). Symbolizing the Morning Star and his [[fireball (meteor)|fireball]]s, two men would come from the east and touch flaming branches to her armpits and groin. She would then be touched with [[gunstock war club|war clubs]] by four other men.  A sacred arrow from the Skull bundle was shot through her heart by the man who captured her while simultaneously another man struck her over the head with the war club from the Morning Star bundle. The dead girl's chest would then be cut open by the priest with a flint knife while her captor caught her blood on dried meat. ("A very small cut is made ... The heart is not exposed or removed.")&lt;ref name=MurieI/&gt;{{rp|123}} All male members of the tribe would then press forward and shoot arrows into the dead body, then circle the scaffold four times and disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote="The procession was timed so that she would be left alone on the scaffold at the moment the morning star rose.  When the morning star appeared, two men came from the east with flaming brands and touched her lightly in the arm pits and groins.  Four other men then touched her with war clubs.  The man who had captured her then ran forward with the bow from the Skull bundle and a sacred arrow and shot her through the heart while another man struck her on the head with the war club from the Morning Star bundle. The officiating priest then opened her breast with a flint knife and smeared his face with the blood while her captor caught the falling blood on dried meat.  All the male members of the tribe then pressed forward and shot arrows into the body.  They then circled the scaffold four times and dispersed." |last=Linton|year=1926|page=459|title=The origin of the Pawnee Morning Star Sacrifice|work=American Anthropologist.|volume=28|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=To fulfill the creation of life, the men of the village would take on the role of the Morning Star, which is why two men would come from the east with flaming brands, representing the sun.  The men  acted out the violence which had allowed the Morning Star to mate with the Evening Star (by breaking her vaginal teeth) in their creation story, with a "meteor stone." |last=Weltfish|title=The Lost Universe: Pawnee Life and Culture|year=1965|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By shooting arrows into her body, the village men, as embodiments of Morning Star, were symbolically mating with her. Her blood would drip down from the scaffolding and onto the ground which had been made to represent the Evening Star's garden of all plant and animal life.  They took her body and lay the girl face down on the prairie, where her blood would enter the earth and fertilize the ground.  The spirit of the Evening Star was released and ceremony ensured the Skidi Pawnee participants of the success of the crops, all life on the Plains, and the perpetuation of the Universe.

{{conversion}}

'''Religious conversion''' is the adoption of a set of beliefs identified with one particular [[religious denomination]] to the exclusion of others. Thus "religious conversion" would describe the abandoning of adherence to one denomination and affiliating with another. This might be from one to another denomination within the same religion, for example, from [[Baptist]] to [[Catholic]] Christianity or from [[Shia Islam|Shi’a]] to [[Sunni Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney and Roger Finke. "Acts of Faith: Explaining the Human Side of Religion." University of California Press, 2000. p.114. {{ISBN|978-0-520-22202-1}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, religious conversion "marks a transformation of religious identity and is symbolized by special rituals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = When There Is No Conversion: Spiritualists and Personal Religious Change | journal = Anthropologica | first = Deirdre | last = Meintel | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 149–162 | accessdate = 2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People convert to a different religion for various reasons, including active conversion by free choice due to a change in beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;Falkenberg, Steve. "Psychological Explanations of ''Religious'' Socialization." Religious Conversion. Eastern Kentucky University. August 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[secondary conversion]], [[deathbed conversion]], conversion for convenience, [[marital conversion]], and [[forced conversion]].

Conversion or reaffiliation for convenience is an insincere act, sometimes for relatively trivial reasons such as a parent converting to enable a child to be admitted to a good school associated with a religion, or a person adopting a religion more in keeping with the [[social class]] they aspire to.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/im-posh-let-me-in-602284.html The Independent newspaper]: "... finding religion – is there anything middle-class parents won't try to get their children into the 'right' schools?"&lt;/ref&gt; When people marry, one spouse may convert to the religion of the other.

Forced conversion is adoption of a different religion under duress. The convert may secretly retain the previous beliefs and continue, covertly, with the practices of the original religion, while outwardly maintaining the forms of the new religion. Over generations a family forced against their will to convert may wholeheartedly adopt the new religion.

''[[Proselytism]]'' is the act of attempting to convert by persuasion another individual from a different religion or belief system. (See [[proselyte]]).

[[Apostasy|Apostate]] is a term used by members of a religion or denomination to refer to someone who has left that religion or denomination.

==Abrahamic religions==
===Bahá'í Faith===
{{Further|Bahá'í Faith}}
In sharing their faith with others, Bahá'ís are cautioned to "obtain a hearing" – meaning to make sure the person they are proposing to teach is open to hearing what they have to say. "[[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í pioneers]]", rather than attempting to supplant the cultural underpinnings of the people in their adopted communities, are encouraged to integrate into the society and apply Bahá'í principles in living and working with their neighbors.

Bahá'ís recognize the divine origins of all revealed religion, and believe that these religions occurred sequentially as part of a divine plan (see [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|Progressive revelation]]), with each new revelation superseding and fulfilling that of its predecessors. Bahá'ís regard their own faith as the most recent (but not the last), and believe its teachings – which are centered around the principle of the oneness of humanity – are most suited to meeting the needs of a global community.

In most countries conversion is a simple matter of filling out a card stating a declaration of belief. This includes acknowledgement of [[Bahá'u'llah]] – the Founder of the Faith – as the Messenger of God for this age, awareness and acceptance of his teachings, and intention to be obedient to the institutions and laws he established.

Conversion to the Bahá'í Faith carries with it an explicit belief in the common foundation of all revealed religion, a commitment to the unity of mankind, and active service to the community at large, especially in areas that will foster unity and concord. Since the Bahá'í Faith has no clergy, converts are encouraged to be active in all aspects of community life. Even a recent convert may be elected to serve on a local [[Spiritual Assembly]] – the guiding Bahá'í institution at the community level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Momen |first = M. |year = 1997 |title = A Short Introduction to the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = One World Publications |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 1-85168-209-0 |url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_short_introduction_bahais }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Christianity conversion refers variously to three different phenomena: a person becoming Christian who was previously not Christian; a Christian moving from one Christian denomination to another;  a particular spiritual development, sometimes called the "second conversion", or "the conversion of the baptised".&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c2a4.htm retrieved 24 Mar 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversion to Christianity is the religious conversion of a previously non-Christian person to some form of Christianity. Some Christian sects require full conversion for new members regardless of any history in other Christian sects, or from certain other sects. The exact requirements vary between different churches and [[Christian denominations|denominations]]. [[Baptism]] is traditionally seen as a sacrament of admission to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Britannica|title=Baptism, Christianity}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christian baptism has some parallels with Jewish immersion by ''[[mikvah]]''.

In the [[New Testament]], Jesus commanded his disciples in the [[Great Commission]] to "go and make disciples of all nations" ({{bibleref2c|Matthew|28:19}}, {{bibleref2c|Mark|16:15}}). [[Evangelization]]—sharing the Gospel message or "Good News" in deed and word, is an expectation of Christians.&lt;ref&gt;"Evangelization." Evangelization.

{{Main|Baptism in Mormonism}}
[[File:Mormon baptism circa 1850s.png|thumb|right|200px|Latter Day Saint baptism ceremony, circa the 1850s]]
Much of the theology of Latter Day Saint baptism was established during the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]] founded by [[Joseph Smith]]. According to this theology, baptism must be by [[Immersion baptism|immersion]], for the remission of [[sin]]s (meaning that through baptism, past sins are forgiven), and occurs after one has shown faith and repentance. Mormon baptism does not purport to remit any sins other than personal ones, as adherents do not believe in [[original sin]]. Latter Day Saints baptisms also occur only after an "[[age of accountability]]" which is defined as the age of eight years.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|68|25|27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theology thus rejects [[infant baptism]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|Moroni|moro|8|4|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Latter Day Saint theology requires that baptism may only be performed with one who has been called and ordained by God with [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] authority.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/gs/baptism-baptize |title= Guide to the Scriptures: Baptism, Baptize: Proper authority |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement operate under a lay priesthood, children raised in a Mormon family are usually baptized by a father or close male friend or family member who has achieved the office of [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priest]], which is conferred upon worthy male members at least 16 years old in the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/priest |title= Gospel Topics: Priest |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baptism is seen as symbolic both of [[Jesus]]' death, burial and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{citation |contribution-url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/baptism |contribution= Baptism |title= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]]: [[Bible Dictionary (LDS Church)|LDS Bible Dictionary]] |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also symbolic of the baptized individual putting off of the natural or sinful man and becoming spiritually reborn as a disciple of Jesus.

Membership into a Latter Day Saint church is granted only by baptism whether or not a person has been raised in the church. Latter Day Saint churches do not recognize baptisms of other faiths as valid because they believe baptisms must be performed under the church's unique authority. Thus, all who come into one of the Latter Day Saint faiths as converts are baptized, even if they have previously received baptism in another faith.

When performing a Baptism, Latter Day Saints say the following prayer before performing the ordinance:

{{quote|Having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|3 Nephi|3-ne|11|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Baptisms inside and outside the temples are usually done in a [[baptistry]], although they can be performed in any body of water in which the person may be completely immersed. The person administering the baptism must recite the prayer exactly, and immerse every part, limb, hair and clothing of the person being baptized. If there are any mistakes, or if any part of the person being baptized is not fully immersed, the baptism must be redone. In addition to the baptizer, two priesthood holders witness the baptism to ensure that it is performed properly.&lt;ref name="Performing Priesthood Ordinances"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://www.lds.org/manual/duties-and-blessings-of-the-priesthood-basic-manual-for-priesthood-holders-part-b/priesthood-and-church-government/lesson-5-performing-priesthood-ordinances |contribution= Performing Priesthood Ordinances |title= Duties and Blessings of the Priesthood: Basic Manual for Priesthood Holders, Part B |year= 2000 |publisher= LDS Church |pages= 41–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following baptism, [[Latter Day Saint]]s receive the [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|Gift of the Holy Ghost]] by the [[laying on of hands]] of a [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] holder.&lt;ref name="Performing Priesthood Ordinances" /&gt;

Latter Day Saints hold that one may be baptized after death through the vicarious act of a living individual, and holders of the Melchezidek Priesthood practice baptism for the dead as a missionary ritual. This doctrine answers the question of the righteous non-believer and the unevangelized by providing a post-mortem means of repentance and salvation.

{{Further|Spread of Islam|List of converts to Islam|Al-Baqara 256|Islamic missionary activity|Conversion to Islam in prisons}}
There are [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars]], or foundations, of [[Islam]] but the primary, and most important is to believe that there is only one [[God in Islam|God]] and creator, referred to as [[Allah]] (the word for God in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) and that the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]], [[Muhammad]], is God's final messenger. The time of a person's conversion is counted from the moment they sincerely make this ''[[Profession (religious)|declaration of faith]]'', called the [[shahada]]h in front of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Vincent J.

The majority clerical opinion holds that circumcision is not a condition for entering Islam. The [[Shafi`i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools regard it as [[fard|obligatory]], while the [[Maliki]] and [[Hanafi]] schools regard it as only recommended. However, it is not a precondition for the acceptance of a person's Islamic practices,{{what?|date=August 2016}} nor is choosing to forgo circumcision considered a sin.

{{Main|Conversion to Judaism|List of converts to Judaism}}

Conversion to Judaism is the religious conversion of [[gentile|non-Jews]] to become members of the [[Judaism|Jewish religion]] and Jewish [[ethnoreligion|ethnoreligious community]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The procedure and requirements for conversion depend on the sponsoring [[Jewish denominations|denomination]]. A conversion in accordance with the process of a denomination is not a guarantee of recognition by another denomination.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Converting to Judaism|date=July 12, 2011|newspaper=BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/beliefs/conversion.shtml|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal conversion is also sometimes undertaken by individuals whose Jewish ancestry is questioned, even if they were raised Jewish, but may not actually be [[Who is a Jew?|considered Jews]] according to [[halakha|traditional Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So You Want to Convert to Judaism?

As late as the 6th century the Eastern [[Byzantine Empire|Roman empire]] and [[Umar|Caliph Umar ibn Khattab]] were issuing decrees against conversion to [[Judaism]], implying that this was still occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pact-umar.asp|title=Internet History Sourcebooks Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a person may forgo a formal conversion to Judaism and adopt some or all beliefs and practices of Judaism. However, without a formal conversion, many highly observant Jews will reject a convert's Jewish status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.convert.org/Movements_in_Judaism.html |title=www.convert.org |publisher=www.convert.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritism ===
There are no rituals or dogmas, nor any sort of procedures in conversion to [[Spiritism]]. The doctrine is first considered as science, then philosophy and lastly as a religion. [[Allan Kardec]]'s [[Spiritist Codification|codification]] of Spiritism occurred between the years 1857 and 1868. Currently there are 25 to 60 million people{{specify|date=October 2018|reason=That's a VERY large range.}}{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} studying Spiritism in various countries, mainly in Brazil, through its [[Spiritist Codification|essential books]], which include ''[[The Spirits Book]]'', ''[[The Book on Mediums]]'', ''[[The Gospel According to Spiritism]]'', ''[[Heaven and Hell (Allan Kardec)|Heaven and Hell]]'' and ''[[The Genesis According to Spiritism]]''.   

[[Chico Xavier]] wrote over 490 additional books, which expand on the [[Spiritism|spiritualist doctrine]].  

As explained in the first of the 1,019 questions and answers in ''The Spirits Book'':  
&lt;blockquote&gt;1. What is God? Answer: "God is the Supreme Intelligence-First Cause of all things."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.allankardec.com/Allan_Kardec/Le_livre_des_esprits/lesp_us.pdf|title=The Spirits Book|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The consensus in Spiritism is that God, the Great Creator, is above everything, including all human things such as rituals, dogmas, denominations or any other thing.

=== Buddhism ===
Persons newly adhering to Buddhism traditionally "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|take Refuge]]" (express [[faith in Buddhism|faith]] in the [[Three Jewels]]—[[Buddhahood|Buddha]], [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]], and [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]]) before a monk, nun, or similar representative, with often the sangha, the community of practitioners, also in ritual attendance.

Throughout the [[timeline of Buddhism]], conversions of entire countries and regions to Buddhism were frequent, as Buddhism spread throughout Asia.  For example, in the 11th century in [[Burma]], king [[Anoratha]] converted his entire country to [[Theravada]] Buddhism. At the end of the 12th century, [[Jayavarman VII]] set the stage for conversion of the [[Khmer people]] to Theravada Buddhism.  Mass conversions of areas and communities to Buddhism occur up to the present day, for example, in the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]] in India there have been [[Dalit Buddhist movement#Organized mass conversions|organized mass conversions]].

Exceptions to encouraging conversion may occur in some Buddhist movements. In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], for example, the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|current Dalai Lama]] discourages active attempts to win converts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cephas-library.com/na/buddhism_dalai_lama_against_prosylitizing.html Dalai Lama opposed to practice of conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209125201/http://www.cephas-library.com/na/buddhism_dalai_lama_against_prosylitizing.html |date=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawei, Bei (2012).

[[File:Bodhinatha-samaya-diksha.JPG|thumb|240px|A yajna initiation to Hinduism ceremony in progress.]]
Since 1800 CE, religious conversion from and to [[Hinduism]] has been a controversial subject within Hinduism. Some have suggested that the concept of missionary conversion, either way, is contrary to the precepts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="arvindsharma"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Arvind|authorlink=Arvind Sharma|title=Hinduism as a Missionary Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3J7qJA7L4xwC&amp;pg=PA31|date=22 April 2011|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|location=[[Albany, New York]]|isbn=978-1-4384-3211-3|pages=31–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious leaders of some of Hinduism sects such as [[Brahmo Samaj]] have seen Hinduism as a non-missionary religion yet welcomed new members, while other leaders of Hinduism's diverse schools have stated that with the arrival of missionary Islam and Christianity in India, this "there is no such thing as proselytism in Hinduism" view must be re-examined.&lt;ref name=arvindsharma/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauri Viswanathan (1998), Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691058993}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious conversion to Hinduism has a long history outside India. Merchants and traders of India, particularly from Indian peninsula, carried their religious ideas, which led to religious conversions to Hinduism in Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Burma.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], The Indian Religions in Pre-Islamic Indonesia and their survival in Bali, in {{Google books|X7YfAAAAIAAJ|Handbook of Oriental Studies.

For example, [[Arya Samaj]], [[Saiva Siddhanta Church]], [[BAPS]], and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] accept those who have a desire to follow their sects of Hinduism, and each has its own religious conversion procedure.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [https://archive.org/stream/IskconLawBook#page/n0/mode/2up ISKCON Law Book], International Society for Krishna Consciousness, GBC Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades, mainstream Hinduism schools have attempted to systematize ways to accept religious converts, with an increase in inter-religious mixed marriages.&lt;ref name=subramuni/&gt; The steps involved in becoming a Hindu have variously included a period where the interested person gets an informal ''ardha-Hindu'' name and studies ancient literature on spiritual path and practices (English translations of Upanishads, Agamas, Epics, ethics in Sutras, festivals, [[yoga]]).&lt;ref&gt;SS Subramuniyaswami (2000), How to become a Hindu, 2nd Edition, Himalayan Academy, {{ISBN|0945497822}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt; If after a period of study, the individual still wants to convert, a ''Namakarana Samskaras'' ceremony is held, where the individual adopts a traditional Hindu name. The initiation ceremony may also include ''[[Yajna]]'' (i.e., fire ritual with Sanskrit hymns) under guidance of a local Hindu priest.&lt;ref name="subramuni"&gt;SS Subramuniyaswami (2000), How to become a Hindu, 2nd Edition, Himalayan Academy, {{ISBN|0945497822}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these places are ''mathas'' and ''asramas'' (hermitage, monastery), where one or more ''gurus'' (spiritual guide) conduct the conversion and offer spiritual discussions.&lt;ref name=subramuni&gt;SS Subramuniyaswami (2000), How to become a Hindu, 2nd Edition, Himalayan Academy, {{ISBN|0945497822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools encourage the new convert to learn and participate in community activities such as festivals ([[Diwali]] etc.), read and discuss ancient literature, learn and engage in rites of passages (ceremonies of birth, first feeding, first learning day, age of majority, wedding, cremation and others).&lt;ref&gt;SS Subramuniyaswami (2000), How to become a Hindu, 2nd Edition, Himalayan Academy, {{ISBN|0945497822}}[javascript:]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
[[Jainism]] accepts anyone who wants to embrace the religion. There is no specific ritual for becoming a Jain. One does not need to ask any authorities for admission. One becomes a Jain on one's own by observing the five vows (''vratas'')&lt;ref name=pshah&gt;Pravin Shah, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas) of Jainism] Jainism Literature Center, Harvard University Archives (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The five main vows as mentioned in the ancient [[Jain texts]] like [[Tattvarthasutra]] are:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=93}}{{sfn|Sangave|2001|p=67}}
# ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]'' - Not to injure any living being by actions and thoughts.
# ''[[Satya]]'' - Not to lie or speak words that hurt others.
# ''[[Asteya]]'' - Not to take anything if not given.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=99}}
# ''[[Brahmacharya]]'' - Chastity for householders / [[Celibacy]] in action, words and thoughts for monks and nuns.
# ''[[Aparigraha]]'' ([[Non-possession]])- non-attachment to possessions.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=100}}

Following the five vows is the main requirement in Jainism. All other aspects such as visiting temples are secondary. [[Jain monasticism|Jain monks and nuns]] are required to observe these five vows strictly.&lt;ref name=pshah /&gt;

In the 1960s  sociologist [[John Lofland (sociologist)|John Lofland]] lived with [[Unification Church]] [[missionary]] [[Young Oon Kim]] and a small group of American church members in [[California]] and studied their activities in trying to promote their beliefs and win converts to their church.  Lofland noted that most of their efforts were ineffective and that most of the people who joined did so because of personal relationships with other members, often family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/conversion.htm Conversion], [http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/Unification.htm Unification Church], ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Society'', Hartford Institute for Religion Research, [[Hartford Seminary]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Lofland published his findings in 1964 as a doctoral thesis entitled "The World Savers: A Field Study of Cult Processes", and in 1966 in book form by [[Prentice-Hall]] as ''[[Doomsday Cult: A Study of Conversion, Proselytization, and Maintenance of Faith]]''. It is considered to be one of the most important and widely cited studies of the process of religious conversion, and one of the first modern sociological studies of a new religious movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: African diaspora traditions and other American innovations'', Volume 5 of Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America, W.

Research in the [[United States]] and the [[Netherlands]] has shown a [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|positive correlation]] between areas lacking mainstream churches and the percentage of people who are a member of a new religious movement. This applies also for the presence of [[New Age]] centres.&lt;ref&gt;Schepens, T.

Bainbridge ''The future of religion: secularization, revival and cult formation'' (1985) Berkeley/Los Angeles/London: University of California press&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other end of the scale are religions that do not accept any converts, or do so very rarely. Often these are relatively small, close-knit minority religions that are ethnically based such as the [[Yazidi]]s, [[Druze]], and [[Mandaeans]]. [[Zoroastrianism]] classically does not accept converts, but this issue has become controversial in the 20th century due to the rapid decline in membership.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese traditional religion]] lacks clear criteria for membership, and hence for conversion. The [[Shakers]] and some Indian [[Eunuch (court official)#India|eunuch]] brotherhoods do not allow procreation, so that every member is a convert.

==International law==
The [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] defines religious conversion as a [[human rights|human right]]: "Everyone has the right to [[freedom of thought]], conscience and [[freedom of religion|religion]]; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief" (Article 18). Despite this UN-declared human right, some groups forbid or restrict religious conversion (see below).

Based on the declaration the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR) drafted the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], a legally binding treaty. It states that "Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice" (Article 18.1). "No one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice" (Article 18.2).

The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UNCHR]] issued a General Comment on this Article in 1993: "The Committee observes that the freedom to 'have or to adopt' a religion or belief necessarily entails the freedom to choose a religion or belief, ''including the right to replace one's current religion or belief with another'' or to adopt atheistic views [...] Article 18.2 bars coercion that would impair the right to have or adopt a religion or belief, including the use of threat of physical force or penal sanctions to compel believers or non-believers to adhere to their religious beliefs and congregations, to recant their religion or belief ''or to convert''." (CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.4, General Comment No. 22.; emphasis added)

Some countries distinguish voluntary, motivated conversion from organized proselytism, attempting to restrict the latter. The boundary between them is not easily defined: what one person considers legitimate evangelizing, or witness-bearing, another may consider intrusive and improper. Illustrating the problems that can arise from such subjective viewpoints is this extract from an article by Dr. C. Davis, published in [[Cleveland State University]]'s ''Journal of Law and Health'': "According to the [[Union of American Hebrew Congregations]], [[Jews for Jesus]] and [[Hebrew Christians]] constitute two of the most dangerous cults, and its members are appropriate candidates for [[deprogramming]]. Anti-cult evangelicals ... protest that 'aggressiveness and proselytizing ... are basic to authentic Christianity,' and that Jews for Jesus and [[Campus Crusade for Christ]] are not to be labeled as cults. Furthermore, certain [[Hassidic]] groups who physically attacked a meeting of the Hebrew Christian 'cult' have themselves been labeled a 'cult' and equated with the followers of [[Reverend Moon]], by none other than the President of the Central Conference of American Rabbis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/cult_art.htm|title=Joining a Cult: Religious Choice or Psychological Aberration?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the collapse of the former [[Soviet Union]] the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] has enjoyed a revival. However, it takes exception to what it considers illegitimate proselytizing by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Salvation Army]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and other religious movements in what it refers to as its ''canonical territory''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Greece]] has a long history of conflict, mostly with [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], but also with some [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]], over its laws on proselytism. This situation stems from a law passed in the 1930s by the dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. A Jehovah's Witness, [[Minos Kokkinakis]], won the equivalent of $14,400 in damages from the Greek state after being arrested for trying to preach his faith from door to door. In another case, ''Larissis v. Greece'', a member of the Pentecostal church also won a case in the [[European Court of Human Rights]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==Islamic exclusivism==
{{Further|Islam and other religions|Divisions of the world in Islam|Islamism}}

[[Muslim]]s believe that [[Islam]] is the original and primordial faith, or [[fitrah]], that was revealed by [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopædia Britannica "Islam"  http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295507/Islam] Accessed July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims maintain that [[Prophets in Islam|previous messages and revelations]] have been [[Tahrif|partially changed or corrupted]] over time&lt;ref name="Distorted"&gt;Accad (2003): According to Ibn Taymiya, although only some Muslims accept the textual veracity of the entire Bible, most Muslims will grant the veracity of most of it.&lt;/ref&gt; and consider the [[Quran]] to be the unaltered and the [[Khatam an-Nabiyyin|final revelation]] from Allah. Religious concepts and practices include the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars of Islam]], which are basic concepts and obligatory acts of worship, and following [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which touches on virtually every aspect of life and society, encompassing everything from [[Islamic banking|banking]] and [[zakāt|welfare]], to [[Islamic military jurisprudence|warfare]] and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp.111, 112, 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Shari'ah | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam began its history with an exclusivist attitude toward [[polytheist]] religions, but an inclusivist attitude toward monotheists, including Christians and Jews. Believers in the oneness of God were given the status of ''[[dhimmi]]'', conferring on them certain rights, including the right to practice their religions openly and not to be pressured to accept [[Islam]]. 

In practice, however, neither the inclusion of Jews and Christians nor militant exclusivism toward "pagans" was always practiced. Trinitarian Christians were accused of [[idolatry]] because of their veneration of [[icon]]s and were also sometimes treated as polytheists because of the doctrines of the [[Trinity]] and the [[Incarnation]]. As strict monotheists, Jews generally fared better than Christians under Islamic rule. Jews and Christians are viewed largely favorably as compared to any other religion.

The basic attitude of Islam toward other religions remains unchanged today, and certain Islamic nations, such as [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iran]], are more exclusivistic toward other religions than are others, such as [[Indonesia]] and [[Egypt]].

Islam does accept sincere [[Jew]]s, [[Christian]]s, and [[Sabians]] as [[People of the Book|people "of the Book"]] along with [[Muslim]]s.

==Judaism==

Although most Jews are pluralist or inclusivist some [[Jews]] believe that the [[God in Judaism|God]] of [[Abraham]] is the [[Monotheism|one true God]]. The Jews believe the God of Abraham entered into a [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with the ancient [[Israelites]], marking them as his [[Jews as the chosen people|Chosen People]], giving them a mission to spread the concept of monotheism. Jews do not consider their chosenness to be a mark of superiority to other nations, but a responsibility to be an example of behavior for other nations to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judaism.about.com/od/judaismbasics/a/jewsaschosenpeople.htm "What Does It Mean For Jews to Be the Chosen People?" Pelaia, Ariela.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
Buddhist religious exclusivism may be seen in the implication that those who do not accept the teachings of the Buddha, such as the [[Eightfold Path]], are destined to repeat the cycle of suffering through endless reincarnations; while those who practice the true way can reach enlightenment. Neo-Buddhist groups sometimes consider their tradition the true path to enlightenment and engage in strong evangelical efforts to influence those they consider to be in darkness. Several sects associated with{{Clarify|date=March 2009}} [[Nichiren Buddhism]] may be included in this category.

However, many followers of [[Eastern religion]]s are not exclusivist. For example, there are millions of [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] who would also consider themselves to follow [[Confucianism]] or [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://byustudies.byu.edu/showtitle.aspx?title=7154|title=Testing Stark's Thesis:Is Mormonism the First New World Religion since Islam?|author=Gerald R.

'''Saint Rita of Cascia''' (Born '''Margherita Lotti''' 1381 – 22 May 1457) was an [[Italy|Italian]] widow and [[Augustinian nuns|Augustinian nun]] venerated as a saint in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Rita was married at an early age. The marriage lasted for eighteen years, during which she is remembered for her [[Christian values]] as a model wife and mother who made efforts to convert her husband from his abusive behavior. Upon the murder of her husband by another feuding family, she sought to dissuade her sons from revenge.

She subsequently joined an [[Augustinian]] community of [[nuns|religious sisters]], where she was known both for practicing [[mortification of the flesh]]&lt;ref name=mershman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13064a.htm|title=''Catholic Encyclopedia'': St. Rita of Cascia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the efficacy of her prayers. Various miracles are attributed to her intercession, and she is often portrayed with a bleeding wound on her forehead, which is understood to indicate a partial [[stigmata]].

[[Pope Leo XIII]] [[Canonization|canonized]] Rita on 24 May 1900. Her feast day is celebrated on May 22. At her canonization ceremony she was bestowed the title of ''Patroness of Impossible Causes'', while in many [[Catholic countries]], Rita came to be known to be as the [[patroness]] of abused wives and heartbroken women.

[[File:Rita-Roccap.jpg|thumb|left|Sanctuary of Saint Rita at [[Roccaporena]], [[Italy]].]]
[[File:CasciaBasilicaSantaRita1.jpg|thumb|left|Basilica of Saint Rita at [[Cascia]].]]

Saint Rita (Margherita Lotti) was born in 1381 in the city of [[Roccaporena]] a small suburb of Cascia (near [[Spoleto]], [[Umbria]], [[Italy]])&lt;ref name=digregorio&gt;[http://www.saintritashrine.org/life-of-saint-rita/ DiGregorio OSA, Michael. ''The Precious Pearl/The Story of Saint Rita of Cascia'', National Shrine of St. Rita of Cascia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; where various sites connected with her are the focus of pilgrimages. Her parents, Antonio and Amata Ferri Lotti, were known to be noble, charitable persons, who gained the epithet ''Conciliatore di Cristo'' (English: ''Peacemakers of Christ'').&lt;ref name=mershman /&gt;
&lt;!-- Please do not change her age below (twelve) back to eighteen, without first reading its discussion on the Discussion page. If you disagree with the age of twelve, or have further evidence that she was eighteen from a reputable source, please post it on the Discussion page first so that it may be debated properly --&gt;
According to pious accounts, Rita was originally pursued by a [[notary]] named ''Gubbio'' but she resisted his offer. She was married at age twelve to a nobleman named Paolo Mancini. Her parents arranged her marriage, a common practice at the time, despite her repeated requests to be allowed to enter a [[convent]] of religious sisters.  Her husband, Paolo Mancini, was known to be a rich, quick-tempered, immoral man, who had many enemies in the region of [[Cascia]]. Rita had her first child at the age of twelve.

Rita endured his insults, physical abuse, and infidelities for many years. According to popular tales, through humility, kindness, and patience, Rita was able to convert her husband into a better person, more specifically renouncing a family [[feud]] known at the time as ''La Vendetta''. Rita eventually bore two sons, Giangiacomo (Giovanni) Antonio, and Paulo Maria, and brought them up in the Christian faith. As time went by and the family feud between the Chiqui and Mancini families became more intense, Paolo Mancini became congenial, but his allies betrayed him and he was violently stabbed to death&lt;ref name=digregorio /&gt; by Guido Chiqui, a member of the feuding family.

Rita gave a public pardon at Paolo's funeral to her husband's murderers.&lt;ref name=digregorio /&gt; Paolo Mancini's brother, Bernardo, was said to have continued the blood [[family feud]] and hoped to convince Rita's sons to seek revenge. Bernardo convinced Rita's sons to leave their [[manor]] and live at the Mancini [[villa]] ancestral home. As her sons grew, their characters began to change as Bernardo became their tutor. Rita's sons wished to revenge their father's murder. Rita, fearing that her sons would lose their souls, tried to persuade them from retaliating, but to no avail. Accordingly, she petitioned God to take her sons rather than submit them to possible [[mortal sin]] and [[murder]]. Her sons died of [[dysentery]] a year later, which pious Catholics believe was God's answer to her prayer, taking them by natural death rather than risk them committing a mortal sin punishable by [[Hell]].

After the deaths of her husband and sons, Rita desired to enter the [[monastery]] of [[Mary Magdalene|Saint Mary Magdalene]] in [[Cascia]] but was turned away. Although the convent acknowledged Rita's good character and piety, the nuns were afraid of being associated with her due to the scandal of her husband's violent death. However, she persisted in her cause and was given a condition before the convent could accept her: the task of reconciling her family with her husband's murderers. She implored her three patron saints ([[John the Baptist]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], and [[Nicholas of Tolentino]]) to assist her, and she set about the task of establishing peace between the hostile parties of Cascia.&lt;ref name=parish&gt;{{cite web|url=http://st-rita.org/the-story-of-st-rita-of-cascia/|title=The Story of St. Rita of Cascia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular religious tales recall that the [[bubonic plague]], which ravaged Italy at the time, infected Bernardo Mancini, causing him to relinquish his desire to feud any longer with the Chiqui family. She was able to resolve the conflicts between the families and, at the age of thirty-six, was allowed to enter the monastery.&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/rita_di_cascia.pdf St. Rita di Cascia] from [[Alban Butler|Fr.

Pious Catholic legends later recount that she was transported into the monastery of Saint Magdalene via [[levitation]] at night into the garden courtyard by her three patron saints. She remained at the monastery, living by the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Augustinian Rule]], until her death from tuberculosis on 22 May 1457.&lt;ref name=rotelle&gt;[http://www.osa-west.org/saintrita.html Rotelle, John.

[[File:Rita-sep.jpg|thumb|Saint Rita's tomb with her [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt body]] at the Basilica of [[Cascia]].]]

The ''"Acta''" or life story of Saint Rita was compiled by the [[Augustinian]] priest, Father Jacob Carelicci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/arquidiocesis_morelia/docs/sanisidro|title=San Isdiro Labrador|author=Arquidiócesis de Morelia|work=Issuu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rita was [[Beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Urban VIII]] in 1626.&lt;ref name=foley&gt;[http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Saints/saint.aspx?id=1391 Foley O.F.M., Leonard. ''Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast'', (revised by Pat McCloskey O.F.M.), Franciscan Media] {{ISBN|978-0-86716-887-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope's private secretary, [[Fausto Poli|Cardinal Fausto Poli]], had been born some fifteen kilometers (nine miles) from her birthplace and much of the impetus behind her cult is due to his enthusiasm. She was [[Canonization|canonized]] on May 24, 1900&lt;ref name=mershman /&gt; by [[Pope Leo XIII]]. Her [[feast day]] is May 22. On the 100th anniversary of her canonization in 2000, [[Pope John Paul II]] noted her remarkable qualities as a Christian woman: “Rita interpreted well the 'feminine genius' by living it intensely in both physical and spiritual motherhood.”&lt;ref name=cna&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint.php?n=464|title=ST. RITA OF CASCIA :: Catholic News Agency (CNA)|work=Catholic News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has acquired the reputation, together with St. Jude, as a saint of impossible cases. She is also the patron saint of sterility, abuse victims, loneliness, marriage difficulties, parenthood, widows, the sick, bodily ills, and wounds.&lt;ref name=cna /&gt;

Her body, which has remained incorrupt over the centuries, is venerated today in the shrine at Cascia, which bears her name.&lt;ref name=rotelle /&gt; Many people visit her tomb each year from all over the world.&lt;ref name=foley /&gt; French painter [[Yves Klein]] had been dedicated to her as an infant. In 1961, he created a Shrine of St. Rita, which is placed in Cascia Convent.&lt;ref&gt;Weitemeier, Hannah, Yves Klein, Taschen, Köln 2001, S. 70–71, {{ISBN|3-8228-5643-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
[[File:S.Rita da Cascia.jpg|thumb|A popular religious depiction of Saint Rita during her partial [[Stigmata]], though historically inaccurate, she is wearing a black [[Augustinian]] habit instead of the brown robe and white veil of Monastery of Saint Mary Magdalene from the 13th century.]]

Various religious symbols are related to Saint Rita. She is depicted holding a thorn (symbol of her penance and stigmata), holding a large [[Crucifix]], holding a Palm leaf with three crowns (representing her two sons and husband), flanked by two small children (her sons), holding a Gospel book, holding a skull (a symbol of mortality) and holding a [[flagellation|flagella]] whip (a symbol of her [[mortification of the flesh]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

=== The forehead wound ===
When St. Rita was approximately sixty years of age, she was meditating before an image of Christ crucified. Suddenly, a small wound appeared on her forehead, as though a thorn from the crown that encircled Christ’s head had loosened itself and penetrated her own flesh. For the next fifteen years she bore this external sign of union with Christ.

=== Roses ===
It is said that near the end of her life Rita was bedridden at the convent. While visiting her, a cousin asked if she desired anything from her old home. Rita responded by asking for a rose from the garden. It was January, and her cousin did not expect to find one due to the season. However, when her relative went to the house, a single blooming rose was found in the garden, and her cousin brought it back to Rita at the convent.&lt;ref name=parish /&gt; St. Rita is often depicted holding roses or with roses nearby. On her feast day churches and shrines of St. Rita  provide roses to the congregation that are blessed by the priest during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

=== The Bees ===
[[File:Novena to Saint Rita of Cascia (Tagalog).jpg|thumb|A [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] [[novena]] to Saint Rita, published by Catholic Trade Manila in 1981.]]

In the parish church of [[Laarne]], near [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], there is a statue of St. Rita in which several [[bee]]s are featured. This depiction originates from the story of her [[baptism]] as an infant. On the day after her baptism, her family noticed a swarm of white [[bee]]s flying around her as she slept in her crib. However, the [[bee]]s peacefully entered and exited her mouth without causing her any harm or injury. Instead of being alarmed for her safety, her family was mystified by this sight. According to Butler, this was taken to indicate that the career of the child was to be marked by industry, virtue, and devotion.&lt;ref name=butler /&gt;

== Legacy ==
A large sanctuary of St. Rita was built in the early 20th century in Cascia. The sanctuary and the house where she was born are among the most active pilgrimage sites of [[Umbria]].

French singer [[Mireille Mathieu]] adopted St. Rita as her [[patron saint]] on the advice of her [[paternal grandmother]]. In her autobiography, Mathieu describes buying a candle for St. Rita using her last [[franc]]. Though Mathieu claims that her prayers did not always come true, she testifies that they inspired her to become a strong and determined woman.&lt;ref name="mimi autobiography"&gt;Mathieu, Mireille; Cartier, Jacqueline. Oui Je Crois. First Edition, Paris: Robert Laffont Publisher, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, ''[[Rita of Cascia (film)|Rita of Cascia]]'', a film based on St. Rita's life, was made starring [[Elena Zareschi]]. The story of St. Rita increased in popularity due to a 2004 film ''Santa Rita da Cascia'', filmed in [[Florence, Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianfilmdatabase.com/review/rita-da-cascia-saint-rita/|title=Saint Rita (Rita da Cascia)|work=Christian Movies All in One Place, Easy to Find! CFDb!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter film altered the facts of St. Rita's early life.

St. Rita is often credited as also being the unofficial patron saint of [[baseball]] due to a reference made to her in the 2002 film ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crzblue.mlblogs.com/2011/06/03/patron-saint-of-baseball/|title=Patron Saint of Baseball|work=Dodger Blue World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''S'chach''' (סכך) is the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name for the material used as a roof for a [[sukkah]], used on the [[Jewish holidays|Jewish holiday]] of [[Sukkot]].

S'chach has to derive from things that have "grown from the ground", such as [[Arecaceae|palm]] leaves, [[bamboo]] sticks and [[pine tree]] branches. Some types of wooden slats and other types of [[organic material]] can be used for s'chach, unless they were processed for a different use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/seasonal/428/undercover-the-halachos-of-schach/|title=Undercover: The Halachos of Schach|website=www.star-k.org|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The s'chach must have been disconnected from the ground so, for example, placing a sukkah under the boughs of a tree would render it not valid. As a minimum, the s'chach must be thick enough that it provides more shade than light in the sukkah. As a maximum, there is a concept of being able to see the stars through the s'chach, but the absolute maximum is that rain should be able to penetrate into the sukkah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oohY_3hMFS8C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=s'chach&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sdOBTs3IL87Zsgby8ciiDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=s'chach&amp;f=false|title=Gateway to Judaism: The What, how and why of Jewish Life|first=Mordechai|last=Becher|date=5 May 2018|publisher=Mesorah Publications|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If the sukkah is kept year round, the s'chach must be replaced no more than 30 days before Sukkos. It is not necessary to completely remove the s'chach; it would be sufficient to lift each piece of s'chach up one foot or more into the air, and then put it back down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beingjewish.com/yomtov/sukkos/build.html|title=How Do We Make a Sukkah?|website=www.beingjewish.com|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tagin''' is one of the major tribe of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], a member of the larger designation of [[Tani Tribes]], the descendants of Abu Tani. Mostly Tagins are in [[Upper Subansiri district]] but are also found to be dispersed among the adjoining districts especially in [[West Siang]] and [[Papum Pare]].

==Religion==

Originally the traditional [[Donyi-Poloism]] as a religion was being followed all around. Which follows the cult of animism and ritualistic nature worshipping in the form of spiritual deities. Where particular kind of animals or bird are sacrificed at the alter (Nyúgè-made out of the bamboos and woods with particular leaves or vines in stuffed shape) to please the spirits, more likely not anger them and keep them in their kind form. Priest or Nyibu [[shaman]] who are born with their powers are the one's who communicate and negotiate between the other world. They are the in between messager from this world to other world. 

Although recent years has seen mass conversion in local community into Christianity. Which has intensified Western influx in the culture, with more and more of the  people embracing western culture. Thus has lead them to leave their  tradition and cultural even the dialect.

==Festivals==
The most important festival of the Tagins is the [[Si-Donyi Festival]], involves the veneration of the earth (si) and the sun (donyi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Social Movements in North-East India|author=Mahendra Naran Karna|publisher=Indus Publishing|year=1998|isbn=81-212-0334-1|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Si-Donyi is celebrated from 4 to 7 January every year. It is celebrated as New Year, Where the Nyibu (local priest) presides over and performs all the rituals with chanting of Uuyu Benam (celestial chantings). And sacrifice of Mithun ([[Gayal]]) for peace and prosperity in the community as a whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5443">'''Techno-animism''' is a culture of technological practice where [[technology]] is imbued with human and spiritual characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Casper|date=2013|title=Techno-animism in Japan: Shinto Cosmograms, Actor-network Theory, and the Enabling Powers of Non-human Agencies|url=http://www.sagepub.net/tcs/|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes that technology, humanity and religion can be integrated into one entity. As an anthropology theory, techno-animism examines the interactions between the material and the spiritual aspects of technology in relation to humans. Techno-animism is often studied in the context of Japan since techno-animism traces most of its roots to the [[Shinto]] religion.

== Background and history ==
[[File:Japan - Miyajima - Mount Misen (2).jpg|thumb|The deity of roads and borders represented in a human form.]]
The practice of instilling human and spiritual characteristics into physical objects has always been part of the Shinto religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/862745839|title=A Japanese view of nature : the world of living things|last=1902-1992.|first=Imanishi, Kinji,|last2=1902-1992.|first2=今西, 錦司,|others=Asquith, Pamela J., 1951-|isbn=9781136131141|location=London|oclc=862745839}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deity|Deities]] in the Shinto religion often symbolizes objects of the physical world and their statues often take human forms. With these practices, people form tighter bonds with physical objects. In [[Japanese Culture|Japanese culture]], the interaction between humans and non-human objects is critical to the harmonious coexistence of men and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/704272999|title=Difference and modernity : social theory and contemporary Japanese society|last=R.|first=Clammer, J.|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203841365|location=London|oclc=704272999}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prime example of this type of interaction is that before meals, Japanese people always say "[[itadakimasu]]" which expresses gratitude for the ingredients of the meal may it be animals or plants.

Techno-animism builds upon the practices of the Shinto religion by instilling human and spiritual characteristics into technology. As for representation, techno-animism is often embodied in the engineering design of objects and the way that people interact with those objects. In a larger social context, Techno-animism provides a means for technology to be integrated into the human society because new technology can always be instilled with traditional values.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tsurumi, K. (1992) Animism and Science. Research Papers series A-58, Institute of International Relations, Sophia University, Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:HONDA ASIMO.jpg|thumb|A humanoid robot designed by Honda |193x193px]]
[[File:Charge of the fembots Robot Restaurant, Shinjuku Tokyo.jpg|thumb|Robots "dancing" and "singing" at a show|165x165px]]
The design of certain objects can have human-related traits that illustrate techno-animism. A robot designed by Honda called [[ASIMO]] takes the form of an astronaut wearing a spacesuit. The form factor along with the spiritual values associated with space exploration makes ASIMO an embodiment of techno-animism. In addition, ASIMO can also communicate with humans through language and gestures. Communication is a defining factor of determining whether something is an individual being or not.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, F. (2004) ‘Who is afraid of the humanoid? Investigating cultural differences in the acceptance of robots’, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics. 1(3): 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the [[robot]] industry offers a wide range of functions from talking robots to [[Sex robot|sex robots]]. Conversation and sexual relationships used to be concepts that only belonged to humans. However, technological advancements and techno-animism are breaking down that barrier with engineering designs that embodies human and spiritual characteristics. 

Beyond the design of objects, the way that people choose to interact with objects could also demonstrate techno-animism. In [[Shinjuku]], [[Tokyo]], there is a restaurant where the waiters are robots instead of humans. Rather than talking to another person, customers only interact with machines throughout the dining process. In this process, customers accept the fact that technology has become part of the human society and has a unique way of interacting with humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Social implications ==
Japanese culture and legislation are generally supportive of the techno-animism trend. Considering that Japan's modernization took place in a relatively short period of time in comparison to western nations, techno-animism is seen as a major reason why Japan has been one of the world's centers of technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868914617|title=Themes and theories in modern Japanese history : essays in memory of Richard Storry|others=Henny, Sue, 1947-, Lehmann, Jean-Pierre, 1945-|isbn=9781780939698|location=London|oclc=868914617}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, acceptance of techno-animism is the current attitude in Japan both culturally and legislatively.

[[File:Tecpatl.jpg|thumb|Técpatl (18th month of the [[Aztec calendar]]) (Image from the [[Codex Magliabechiano]])]]
In the [[Aztec]] culture, a '''tecpatl''' was a [[flint]] or [[obsidian]] knife with a [[lanceolate]] figure and double-edged blade, with elongated ends. Both ends could be rounded or pointed, but other designs were made with a blade attached to a handle. It can be represented with the top half red, reminiscent of the color of [[blood]], in representations of [[human sacrifice]] and the rest white, indicating the color of the flint blade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicos1.blogspot.mx/2013/06/los-mexicasy-el-sacrificio-humano-antes.html ''El sacrificio humano en los Mexicas.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the sign of the eighteenth day, the twentieth day of the month of the [[Aztec calendar]] and the beginning of one of the twenty [[trecena]]s of the [[tonalpohualli]].

The Tecpatl knife was traditionally used for human sacrifice by the Aztecs, but it also was the short-range weapon of the [[jaguar warrior]]s. Although it may have seen only limited use on the battlefield, its sharp edges would have made it an effective sidearm.

==Mythical origin of Tecpatl==
[[File:Xipe Totec 1.jpg|thumb|[[Xipe Totec]], carrying a bloody tecpatl. ([[Codex Borgia]])]]
Tecpatl, is one of the most complex [[iconographic]] symbols of [[Aztec mythology]]. This knife expresses multiple meanings that carry a complex view of the world which are closely associated with the notions of origin and [[human sacrifice]].

The Tecpatl (Flint) was born in the height of heaven shaped as a knife, and was thrown down by his brother, and it was destined to descend from heaven to earth. It falls in [[Chicomoztoc]](The Place of the Seven Caves) primary array of peoples, fragmenting into 1600 pieces, and from those fragments a thousand and six hundred gods emerge,  the first gods here on earth. These gods emerging from the Seven Caves are the [[Centzonmimixcoa]] (four snakes clouds). This is confirmed by another version of the myth where the Flint serves as a temporary event marker, appearing as a calendar date, as a carrier of the year Centzonmimixcoa are born: "In year 1 Tecpatl Centzonmimixcoa were born, Iztac [[Chalchiuhtlicue]] (She of the Jade Skirt) begat the fourhundreth mixcohua. Then they went into a cave; and upon entering, their mother gave birth to five more Mimixcoa".''&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"&gt;[http://piedradelsol.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/capitulo-4-tecpatl_-origen-y-sacrificio.pdf ''TECPATL: ORIGEN Y SACRIFICIO.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the version of the Legend of the [[Five Suns]], Tecpatl becomes temporal marker of the birth of the Centzonmimixcoa, and the name of the mother goddess switches to Iztac [[Chalchiuhtlicue]](She of the Jade Skirt).

According to [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] and [[Diego Durán]] they present the homology between this myth and ritual. "Among the ornaments worn by the women representing [[Cihuacoatl]] at parties, they also brought a crib on their back, so to bring your child in it, and stood in the [[tianguis]] among the other women, and disappearing left the crib there . When the other women looked at what was in it, it was a flint and iron were sandeel , with which they killed those whom they sacrificed." Meanwhile,  Duran tells his priests" sought a child cot and put into it a flint knife with which they sacrificed the one they called the son of Cihuacoatl."

In the version where the Centzonmimixcoa are born from the Tecpatl, the mother's name is [[Citlalinicue]]. In the version that is temporary marker Tecpatl birth, the mother is Iztac [[Chalchiuhtlicue]], and in rites the mother of Tecpatl is Cihuacoatl. Three different invocations of the primordial mothers: skirt stars, She of the Jade Skirt, the snake woman who is at once a warrior deity, Tecpatl mother of the fourhundreth Centonmimixcoa born, the first gods on earth, in [[Chicomoztoc]], the womb of the peoples.&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"/&gt;

==Tecpatl in Aztec mythology==
[[File:Signo Técpatl.png|thumb|400px|Tecpatl (sacrificial knife), image based on the [[Codex Borgia]]]]
In [[Aztec mythology]], the tecpatl was sometimes drawn as a simple flint blade, sharpened with some notches on the edge, in the [[Codex Borgia]] it appears red.&lt;ref name="Instituto Cultural Quetzalcoatl"&gt;[http://www.samaelgnosis.net/calendario_azteca/18_tecpatl_cuchillo.html ''Día 18. Tecpatl(Cuchillo).'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Tecpatl was associated with Northern [[Cardinal direction|cardinal]] point ([[Mictlan]]).,&lt;ref name="Tlacatiliztonalli"&gt;[http://www.omeacatl.org/tlamatiliztli/?p=976 ''Tlacatiliztonalli ‘Energía de nacimiento’ .'']&lt;/ref&gt; the dark place of eternal stillness and rest of the dead.

The ancient [[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anahuac]], considered the Tecpatl as a symbol of [[Xiuhtecuhtli]] tletl (fire protector of the grass or fire protector of the year), being the oldest method to produce sparks(and fire) by colliding two flints. It also relates to [[Ehecatl]], since in the codices it's represented by high winds, meaning that the air cuts like razor, so it represented xopantla ( spring ), the time of high winds. According to [[Diego Durán]], the former [[Anahuac (Aztec)|Anahuac]] considered the tecpatl as the worst sign of the zodiac, because the men and women born under this sign were happy but prone to infertility.&lt;ref name="Tlacatiliztonalli"/&gt;

==Tecpatl as calendrical symbol==

The image of the tecpatl was a [[Moon|lunar]] symbol and therefore ruled agricultural events. Their patron gods were: [[Chalchiuhtotolin]] and [[Tezcatlipoca]].

In the [[trecena]] of Ce Tecpatl(One Flint), the gods were [[Tonatiuh]] and [[Mictlantecuhtli]]. On day Ce Tecpatl(One Flint), there was a festival dedicated to [[Huitzilopochtli]], patron god of [[Tenochtitlan]].&lt;ref name="tenochtitlan"&gt;[http://tenochtitlan.8k.com/pagina/tonalli/tecpatl.htm ''Tenochtitlan.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Tecpatl Year 1 (1168): the Aztec people left their place of origin, [[Aztlán]], to undertake a long and difficult journey through the arid northern lands, part of what is now known as [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="Germán Fregolent"&gt;[http://www.homohominisacrares.net/php/articulos.php?num_revista=13&amp;cod_articulo=116 ''El Sacrificio Humano entre los aztecas.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tecpatl as a tool for human sacrifice==
[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141).jpg|thumb|300px|Sacrifice of a war captive (Image based on the [[Codex Magliabechiano]])]]
The tecpatl or sacrificial knife, was an important element in Aztec rituals. The tecpatl was used by Aztec priests to open the chest of the victims of [[human sacrifice]] to extract the heart that would feed the gods, in the hope that the offerings would bring blessings to mankind.&lt;ref name="MANUEL AGUILAR-MORENO"&gt;[http://www.famsi.org/spanish/research/aguilar/Aguilar_Art_Text_es.pdf ''ARTE AZTECA.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The most widespread sacrificial procedure among Aztecs, was removal of the heart ([[cardiectomy]]).&lt;ref name="Germán Fregolent"/&gt;

There were different types of knives, some of them allude to human sacrifice, being carved as a skull silhouette, where the nose was used as the cutting edge of the weapon.&lt;ref name="El sacrificio humano en los Mexicas"&gt;[http://historicos1.blogspot.mx/2013/06/los-mexicasy-el-sacrificio-humano-antes.html ''El Sacrificio Humano entre los aztecas.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the few técpatls that have survived, there are some representations of deities in their handles. A famous pre-Columbian example is the carved image of a figure using circular plugs in its ears and a big bow ornament made out of feathers, which associates this figure with [[Tonatiuh]], the sun god. Tonatiuh's arms appears to be holding the knife's blade. This particular knife, emphasizes the importance of human sacrifices to feed the gods, especially the sun god, who illuminates the earth and sustains life.&lt;ref name="MANUEL AGUILAR-MORENO"/&gt;

==Tecpatl in the Sunstone==
[[File:Flower,Wind,Flint,Earthquake.jpg|thumb|300px|Representations of the tecpatl in the sun stone]]
The flint knife, is also represented in the following sections of the [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]]:

# The tongue of the central face representing [[Tonatiuh]].
# The date Ce Tecpatl (one flint), sculpted between the central solar ray and the image of Nahui Ocelotl(4 Jaguar). Here the flint carries a [[glyph]] of [[Tezcatlipoca]].
# The glyph Tecpatl, carved within the circle of twenty days.
# The tongues sticking out of the anthropomorphic faces in profile emerging from the jaws of the two [[xiuhcoatl]] in the outer ring of the monument.
# On the outside edge of the stone, alternating with star glyphs. Each of the latter also uses the tecpatl to represent rays of light (or fire) emitted by the stars.
# On the Xihuitzolli (the royal [[diadem]]), sculpted between the central solar ray and the image of Nahui Ehecatl (4 Wind) quad. The center of the headband has a very similar shape to the knife that can be seen on other representations of the monument, and the tecpatl is commonly found in other representations of this device.&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"/&gt;

==Nahui Ollin and Tecpatl==

In the accounts written by Fray [[Gerónimo de Mendieta]] on the origin of Tecpatl: The [[Centzonmimixcoa]] were the first man-gods, "they shall be as gods who created mankind and subsequently be slaughtered at [[Teotihuacan]], some by jumping into fire, the others by opening their chest with a [[flint]] knife, this in order that the new Sun has movement and life".&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"/&gt;

This story is related to two main [[iconographic]] elements from [[Aztec calendar stone|Sunstone]]: one is the Flint Knife (Tecpatl), and the other is the glyph: Four Movement ([[Five Suns|Nahui Ollin]])&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"/&gt;
[[File:Aztec or Mixtec sacrificial knife 2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Aztec or Mixtec sacrificial knife, probably for ceremonial use only, in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/k/knife_with_a_mosaic_handle.aspx Website of the British Museum.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020114944/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aoa/k/knife_with_a_mosaic_handle.aspx |date=2015-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Tecpatl and Mixcoatl – Tezcatlipoca==

In the version of the Legend of the [[Five Suns]], as well as the fourhundreth, five more [[Centzonmimixcoa]] are born. The Sun god ([[Tonatiuh]]) sends these five Centzonmimixcoa to destroy their older siblings, but they do not offer any of their kill to the Sun god, or the Earth Lord([[Tlaltecuhtli]]) . Among these five is [[Mixcoatl]], who after destroying the fourhundreth Mimixcoa is given a white flint that came gushing out of [[Itzpapalotl]]'s body. It was burned (dedicated to [[Itzpapalotl]]) and broken several times. From there first came the azure flint; the second time flowed white flint. They took the white and wrapped it in a blanket. The third time sprouted yellow flint; neither took only saw. The fourth time flowed red flint; neither took . The fifth time sprang the black flint; neither took. Mixcoatl worshiped the gods by offering the white flint, which he wrapped in another blanket; and carried it on his back and went to fight in the place named Comallan, carrying it as an affering to his god, Itzpapalotl.&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"/&gt;

In [[Aztec codices]], the myth goes that [[Tezcatlipoca]] changed his name to Mixcoatl in the second year after the flood and makes fire from two pieces of flint. Which would explain the reason why, in the [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]], the Tecpatl is carrying the glyph of [[Tezcatlipoca]]. The Tecpatl, linked to the origin of the fire, is also identified as a symbol of the sun and stars.&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"/&gt;

==Tecpatl associated with the moon==
[[File:Tecpatl Codex Borgia page 18.jpg|thumb|Técpatl represented on the moon [[Codex Borgia]] page 18.]]
In the codices, the moon is usually shown on a framework of dark night, as a kind of vessel cross-cut and usually filled with a liquid form. The vessel appears to be formed by a crooked bone, and inside is almost always the figure of a rabbit, a tecpatl or sometimes a small snail. Sometimes the moon is represented in the same way as the sun, with rays, but with different colors and with a snail or tecpatl in the center.&lt;ref name="Yólotl González Torres"&gt;[http://www.historicas.unam.mx/publicaciones/revistas/nahuatl/pdf/ecn10/131.pdf ''Algunos aspectos del culto a la luna en el México antiguo.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Codex Borgia]], the flint knife is imposed inside the lunar glyph replacing the rabbit. This substitution, undoubtedly refers to the relationship between the moon and death. The Legend of the [[Five Suns]], the name of the moon god is Nahui be Tecpatl (Four-Flint knife).

==Anthropomorphizing Tecpatl==
[[File:Íxquac.JPG|thumb|Aztec sacrificial knife made out of [[flint]], exhibit from Museo del [[Templo Mayor]], in [[Mexico City]].]]
In other more elaborate representations in addition to the basic form, the tecpatl can appear [[anthropomorphized]], with two to seven teeth and an eye in the central region, which has a pupil center and an eyebrow on top; this eye is similar to that shown in the image of [[mizquitli]] (death).&lt;ref name="Tlacatiliztonalli"/&gt; Other times it was built into an elaborate handle made of wood or stone inlaid with turquoise and shell.

Other times, the flint was represented deified bristling with teeth or fangs and jaws with one eye.&lt;ref name=" Fernando Díaz Infante"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U9cQ5GowA10C&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=tecpatl+azteca&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qjF2_POgJI&amp;sig=eeTyc167xU3SBXPceP3xKjaDCWE&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NXF6Uq7BK9LekQec1oHwCw&amp;ved=0CGwQ6AEwDw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''La Estela De Los Soles O Calendario Azteca.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A knife found in the [[Templo Mayor]] of [[Tenochtitlan]], shows a profile of a face that presumably represents the carrier of the tecpatl year(a minor deity). Its teeth and eyes were accented with inlaid white flint and obsidian, a volcanic rock. As it is a sacred sacrificial knife it is symbolically related to [[Mictlan]], the lower part of the universe where the emaciated beings live . Mictlan was associated with the color black and the tecpatl (sacrificial knife). This knife is associated with the black god [[Tezcatlipoca]], who embodies an obsidian knife representing the black wind. As sacrificial knife, it is also associated with the North (the direction of death) and the [[Flaying|flayed]]
god [[Xipe Totec]].&lt;ref name="MANUEL AGUILAR-MORENO"/&gt;

==Tecpatl represented as tongue or nose==
[[File:Mictlantecuhtli Codex Borgia page 18.jpg|thumb|[[Mictlantecuhtli]] with tecpatls representing his nose and tongue ([[Codex Borgia]], page 18).]]
The knife inserted into the nasal cavity symbolizes "cut the air", which is a vital element in symbolizing death.&lt;ref name="mexico-tenoch"&gt;[http://www.mexico-tenoch.com/magico/sala8.html ''Mexico-tenoch.'']&lt;/ref&gt; The tongue in the form of an obsidian knife (tecpatl) exposed to outside, indicates the need to be fed with the magical substance that was human blood flowing from the heart.&lt;ref name="Los Aztecas 2"&gt;[http://www.monografias.com/trabajos/aztecas2/aztecas2.shtml ''Los Aztecas II.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In excavations of the [[Templo Mayor]], 33 skull-masks representing [[Mictlantecuhtli]] (god of death) were found; made out of the [[Anatomical terms of location|rostral]] portion of human skulls, adorned with shell and pyrite to represent the eyes, and sacrificial knives to simulate nose and tongue.&lt;ref name="Alfredo lópez Austin, leonardo lópez luján"&gt;[http://www.mesoweb.com/about/articles/AM103.pdf ''El sacrificio humano entre los mexicas.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Codex Borbonicus]], [[Xolotl]]'s tongue is made out of [[flint]] and he is carrying another knife with his right hand. [[Tlaltecuhtli]] (Lord of the Earth), is found in various sculptures and manuscripts, with tecpatl representing the tongue of the deity. In the [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]], the tongue of the central face of [[Tonatiuh]] is a tecpatl. In the Codex Borgia, [[Mictlantecuhtli]] (lord of the underworld) appears as an active sacrificer armed with an ax or a técpal, ready to draw the hearts of his victims, his nose and tongue accuse the form of sharp knives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taringa.net/posts/ciencia-educacion/14893357/Mictlantecuhtli-y-el-mundo-de-los-muertos.html ''Mictlantecuhtli y el mundo de los muertos.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tecpatl in Mexica worldview==

The Tecpatl was in the middle of [[Aztec mythology]], it is in the center of the [[Aztec calendar stone|Sun Stone]], and it was instrumental in the ritual to bring out the heart of the sacrificial victim, which allowed light to reach the heart of the victim and therefore, was a mediator between life and death, between the divine realm and the human, between heaven, earth and the underworld. Since flint had the potential to make fire, it was considered an expression of celestial starlight on earth.&lt;ref name="Piedradelsol"/&gt;

The '''Temple of All Religions''' ({{lang-ru|Храм всех религий}}, {{lang-tt|Барлык диннәр гыйбәдәтханәсе}}) or the '''Universal Temple''' ({{lang-ru|Вселенский храм}}) is a unique architectural complex in the Staroye Arakchino [[Microdistrict]] of [[Kazan]], [[Tatarstan]], [[Russia]]. It consists of several types of [[religious architecture]] including an [[Orthodox church (building)|Orthodox church]], a [[mosque]], and a [[synagogue]], among others. It is currently under construction since 1992, started by local artist and philanthropist [[Ildar Khanov (artist)|Ildar Khanov]].&lt;ref name=kazan24.ru&gt;[https://archive.is/20120715103305/http://kazan24.ru/articles/44414.html Ракурсы. Творчество Ильдара Ханова] at kazan24.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure serves as a cultural center and a residence for Khanov and his assistants.

Khanov is known for his efforts in the treatment of [[alcoholism]], [[drug addiction]], and various other diseases.&lt;ref name=kazan24.ru/&gt; His former and current patients help him to maintain and develop the Temple, either by direct involvement in the construction work or through sponsorship.

The structure is not an active temple of any religion, but rather, as Khanov describes its mission, a "temple of culture and truth". It has become a popular landmark in the city of Kazan, which takes pride in the peaceful combination of different cultures ([[Islam]]ic [[Tatars|Tatar]] culture, [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russians|Russian]], and others). The Temple is visited both by tourists and by people seeking Khanov's help.

Khanov says that eventually the structure will have 16 [[cupola]]s, corresponding to the 16 major [[world religion]]s including past religions that are no longer practiced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100607022502/http://gokazan.ru/webcard/view/70/270.htm Temple of the Universe] at the [[Kazan]] tourist portal {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17145">The '''Huron Feast of the Dead''' was a mortuary custom of the [[Wyandot people]] of what is today [[central Ontario]], [[Canada]], which involved the disinterment of deceased relatives from their initial individual graves followed by their reburial in a final communal grave.
A time for both mourning and celebration, the custom became spiritually and culturally significant.

Early in the custom's development, as whole villages moved to a new location, other Wyandot would travel to join them in arranging mass reburials of their dead, who were transported to the new location. The people would take dead bodies out of their first graves and clean the remains in preparation for reburial in a new location. Customs evolved over the centuries as populations migrated and increased. They continued to follow traditional beliefs about the [[afterlife]]. The arrival of Europeans added new aspects to the process. The Huron adopted a practice of exchanging material gifts as a central part of these festivals. Some among the Wyandot criticized these practices. The French missionary [[Jean de Brébeuf]] discussed such a ceremony which he saw in 1636 at the Wyandot capital of ''Ossossané.'' (now in [[Simcoe County, Ontario]]). Twentieth-century archeological excavations revealed and confirmed information about these traditions.

==Mortuary customs in the Pre-Contact era==
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Wyandot communities rapidly expanded in population and in the territory they occupied. Settlements were small compared to later standards and their [[ossuary|ossuaries]] were small. Ceremonies were carried out independently as each village would separately rebury their dead when they moved. In contrast to later examples, no ossuary ever held more than thirty individuals. The survivors left modest grave offerings made of non-durable materials.&lt;ref name=Seeman60&gt;Seeman, Erik. ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press 2011), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Burials were communal, a characteristic that persisted as other aspects of Wyandot culture changed.&lt;ref&gt;Williamsonn Ronald. ''Bones of the Ancestors: The Archeology and Osteography of the Moatfield Ossuary'' (Gatineau, Canadian Museum of Civilisation, 2003) p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1500s Wyandot population growth began to stabilize. With this demographic change, well before European arrival, the traditional mortuary customs started evolving into what are more recognizable as Feasts of the Dead. With the increase of population, it became the norm to wait for a period of several years between the first and the second burial. This change considerably increased the size of the ossuaries, as the extended period meant that graves  held several hundred individuals.&lt;ref name=Seeman60 /&gt;

Huron communities changed the location of their village every ten to fifteen years. They believed that they had to protect their dead when they moved, and they started to rebury them every time a large village migrated.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce. ''The Huron: Farmers of the North'', (Orlando, Saunders College Publishing, 1990) p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremonies occurred at the end of the winter months, before the Huron had to undertake tasks associated with agriculture and spring hunting. The symbolism of the end of winter and start of spring fit into their beliefs that separated the living and the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman, Erik. ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', (Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press 2011), p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

By the period when the Wyandot migrated to [[Wyandot people|Wendake]] (on the south shore of [[Georgian Bay]] in modern-day [[Simcoe County, Ontario|Simcoe]] and [[Grey County, Ontario|Grey]] counties in [[Ontario]]), these mortuary rituals came to represent the unity and friendship of Wyandot bands. Multiple villages would gather together for combined ceremonies and to exchange gifts. The exchange of gifts and the symbolism of a united burial ground became defining elements of the Feasts of the Dead.&lt;ref name=Seeman61&gt;Seeman (2011), ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gabriel Sagard]], a French missionary writing in the 1620s, described the purpose of the rituals:

{{quote|"By means of these ceremonies and gatherings they contract new unions and friendships amongst themselves, saying that, just as the bones of their deceased relatives and friends are gathered together and united in one place, so also they themselves ought during their lives to live all together in the same unity and harmony, like good kinsmen and friends."&lt;ref name=Seeman61 /&gt;}}

These ceremonies of remembrance and celebration fostered a [[sense of community]] among the people. They continued as an important [[community building]] practice through the seventeenth century.

==Effect of European contact on traditional mortuary customs==
[[Wyandot people#European contact and Wendat dispersal|Contact with Europeans]] introduced new goods and materials that were extremely useful in everyday life. The acquisition of these goods transformed Wyandot society and by extension, the nature of their mortuary customs as well. In the pre-contact era, material grave offerings had been minimal, but the quantity and quality of material goods offered to the deceased became a sign of reverence. Significant grave offerings were expected as they demonstrated the generosity and wealth of the giver, as well as theoretically guaranteeing the goodwill of the deceased souls.&lt;ref name="Seeman, Erik 2011 p. 95"&gt;Seeman (2011), ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

This increase was not only due to the circulation of European goods of more durable materials. Archaeological excavations and historical accounts indicate that it became customary to offer a great number of Indigenous items too. The [[fur trade]] increased the circulation of goods between native groups, and new tools facilitated craftsmanship. The people used their new material wealth to demonstrate devotion to the most sacred of traditional customs.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman (2011), ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', pp. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

The feast had evolved into a way to strengthen alliances, but after European contact, this became all the more important. It was customary to invite friends and relatives from other tribes to promote Huron unity. All communities were warned when a feast was to take place, and the dead were transported from great distances so friends and relatives could be buried together.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger (1990), ''The Huron'', pp. 126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of other native groups were often invited, in order to confirm powerful bonds, but combined burials among different tribes were rare. It was in this period that the Feasts of the dead were most impressive. The ties were reaffirmed by many gifts, and the presence of foreigners encouraged the Huron to impress their visitors. This change in customs both encouraged and required the fur trade, as the process of renewal of alliances was a key part of the Feasts. In 1636 [[Jesuit missions in North America|French missionaries]] were invited to a ceremony to ally with, and impress, the Europeans. There was also a secondary motivation to confirm the ties that maintained the fur trade.&lt;ref name="Seeman, Erik 2011 p. 95"/&gt;

==1636 Feast of the Dead at Ossossané==
[[Jean de Brébeuf]], a Jesuit missionary, was invited in the spring of 1636 to a large Feast of the Dead outside the village of ''[[Ossossané]],'' the capital of Wendake. His first-person account provided insight into contemporary Huron mortuary customs and has remained the most cited source on the topic. The Huron dispersal occurred in 1650, following [[epidemics]], and conflict with the more powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. Their cultural traditions changed after this upheaval. Brébeuf's account is a unique view of a notable feast that occurred at the height of Huron mortuary customs just before their rapid decline.

The Feast of the Dead took place over a period of ten days. During the first eight days, the participants gathered and prepared the bodies for the reburial. Relatives of the deceased took out their remains, and the corpses, in various degrees of putrefaction, were clothed with [[beaver]] robes.&lt;ref&gt;Greer, Allan. ''The Jesuit Relation: Natives and Missionaries in Seventeenth Century North America''. (Boston, Bedford St. Martins, 2000) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Flesh and skin were removed from the corpses and the bones were individually cleaned. They were wrapped again in another set of beaver furs. Generally women carried out this task, and any sign of revulsion was traditionally discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger (1990), ''The Huron'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;
Wrapped in fur packages, the bones were returned to the homes of relatives, where a feast was held in memory of the dead. Gifts and offerings were placed next to these packages, and visitors were welcomed and treated generously. This was a time to feast, and gather the food and offerings to be used for the main burial event.&lt;ref&gt;Tooker, Elisabeth. ''An Ethnography of the Huron Indians 1615-1649'' (N.A, Syracuse University Press, 1991) p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The village leader announced when all families should transport the bodies. The journey to the new site was often long (possibly several days) and was a time for public mourning, punctuated by sharp cries of the participants. When the chief decided and everyone was present, all would gather around the burial pit for the main ceremony.

[[File:Huron Feast of the Dead by J.-F. Lafitau in Moeurs des sauvages amériquains II 1724.JPG|thumb|alt=Huron Feast of the Dead, where ancestral remains were disinterred and reburied|1724 engraving depicting the traditional Huron Feast of the Dead.]]
Brébeuf described the scene:

{{quote|"There was in the middle of it a great pit, about ten feet deep and five fathoms in diameter. (...) Above rose many poles, trimmed and well arranged, with cross poles to attach the bundles of souls. (...)They laid on the ground their parcels (...) They unfolded also their bundles of robes and all the presents they had brought, and placed them upon poles (...) in order to give foreigners time to view the wealth and magnificence of the country."&lt;ref&gt;Reuben Gold Thwaites, ''The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents'' Vol. 10&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He noted there were 15 to 20 baptized Huron among the dead (rings with Christian symbols were later found at the site.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yT8OAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=ossossane+bone+pit&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9gqJc5BDhK&amp;sig=VMjQhT1h0AqZ0M6bKX2XGLiwIXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dh4pUtHvHYqtqgGbsICQAQ&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ossossane%20bone%20pit&amp;f=false Andrew Frederick Hunter, ''Notes of Sites of Huron Villages in the Township of Tiny (Simcoe County) and Adjacent Parts)'', Warwick Bros. &amp; Rutter, printers, 1899, p. 36]&lt;/ref&gt; That evening, the bodies were lowered into the pit with three kettles, which were to help the souls reach the after life. If a bundle fell, it was time for everything else (bundles, gifts, corn, wooden stakes and sand) to be thrown in as well. As the pit was filled and covered over, the crowds screamed and sang.&lt;ref&gt;Tooker (1991), ''An Ethnography of the Huron'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Brébeuf described the scene as emotional and chaotic, representing the Huron’s perception of mortality and life in general.

The following and final morning consisted of gift giving among the living; it was a time for celebration. Those who had made the journey were thanked, and ties were reaffirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Greer (2000), ''The Jesuit Relation'', p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of the Feasts==
A high rate of mortality from infectious European diseases and warfare due to the fur trade increased the frequency and size of the Feasts of the Dead until the Wyandot dispersal in the middle of the seventeenth century. The last reported Feast of the Dead occurred in 1695. It was held jointly by the Wyandot and [[Odawa people|Ottawa nation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger (1990), ''The Huron'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeology==
[[Modern archaeology]] has revealed significant data about Huron mortuary customs. It has revealed otherwise unattainable details about pre-contact or undocumented burial sites. Archaeological evidence has also been used to verify claims made by Brébeuf about the 1636 feast.

Archaeological finds from burial sites began in the early nineteenth century. Originally these finds were often accidental. As farmers moved into the region north of [[Lake Ontario]], they unintentionally plowed up areas that had once been Huron ossuaries. The bones and grave goods  had otherwise been untouched since they had been ritually buried. First amateurs, and later professionals documented the finds and conducted excavations. The gathered information has provided answers to several questions.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman (2011), ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-contact era finds have been used to interpret burial practices and understand how customs changed over the course of three centuries.

Comparison with more recent finds confirmed the continued evolution of mortuary customs.

===Ossossané excavation===
Between 1947 and 1948, archaeologists from the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] uncovered the ossuary burial site of Ossossané, which Brébeuf had described in his account. Led by Kenneth E. Kidd, the excavation was hailed by contemporaries for its use of modern and efficient scientific techniques. These added to and confirmed knowledge of Huron feasts of the Dead. The [[3-Inch method]] was a way to preserve the layers, and showed the order of individuals in graves and what burial goods were placed with them. The lavish nature of grave offerings was confirmed, as were other details from Brébeuf’s account. The Jesuit’s estimates concerning size of the pit, the scaffolding, and contents proved to be relatively accurate. Comparisons with older sites highlighted the evolution of these traditions. It also showed a dramatic decline in the average age of the dead, from 30 to 21, believed to be evidence of disease epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman (2011), ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern controversies and conclusion==
The 1947 excavation at Ossossané was carried out without any consultation with the Wyandot,  which proved to be a later source of controversy.

In 1990, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]], which provided modern-day descendants of American native groups the right to demand the return of human remains from museums and other institutions. Its effects were felt in Canada as well. In 1999 the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] bowed to pressure and agreed to return the Ossossané remains to the Huron groups for reburial according to their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman (2011), ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', pp. 140-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony was held in Midland Ontario, a few miles away from Brébeuf’s grave. The dispersed Wyandot peoples were reunited on the morning of August 29, 1999. The human remains were lowered into a pit, with the items that had been dug up by Kenneth Kidd and his team.&lt;ref&gt;Seeman (2011), ''The Huron-Wendat Feast of the Dead'', pp. 142-144&lt;/ref&gt; These were covered by earth, over which cement was poured, to ensure the remains were never disturbed again.

{{Jainism}}
The '''''Vira Nirvana Samvat''''' (era) is a [[calendar era]] beginning on 15 October 527 BCE. It commemorates the [[nirvana]] of [[Mahavira]], the 24th [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]]. This is one of the oldest system of chronological reckoning which is still used in [[India]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=24}}

== History ==

The earliest text to mention 527 BCE as the year of [[Mahavira]]'s [[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]] is [[Yati-Vrishabha]]'s ''[[Tiloya-Pannatti]]'' (5th century CE).{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=84}} Subsequent works such as [[Jinasena]]'s ''[[Harivamsa Purana|Harivamśa]]'' (783 CE) mention the Vira Nirvana era, and give the difference between it and the [[Shaka era]] (beginning in 78 CE) as 605 years and 5 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=D. C. Sircar |title=Indian Epigraphy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXMB3649biQC&amp;pg=PA321 |year=1965 |publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |isbn=978-81-208-1166-9 |pages=321–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 October 1974 the 2500th Nirvana Mahotsava was celebrated by the Jains throughout India.&lt;ref name="N. Upadhye, Review 1982 pp. 231-232"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mahavira and His Teachings|first=A.

New York Times, 18 Dec 1973]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==

The Jain year Vira Nirvana Samvat is obtained by adding 470 years to the Kartikadi Vikram samvat. For example, The Vira Nirvana Samvat 2544 started right after Diwali of October 20, 2017 on Vikram 2074, Kartika Krishna Amavasya (Chaitradi and Purnimanta).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinejainpathshala.com/images/jf/gallery/tithi_darpan_2018.jpg  Jain Tithi Darpan, Vir Nirvan Samvat 2044]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herenow4u.net/fileadmin/pics/ext/fb/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/15591324_1219042171509416_2745373736079847221_o.jpg___aHR0cHM6Ly9zY29udGVudC54eC5mYmNkbi5uZXQvdi90MzEuMC04LzE1NTkxMzI0XzEyMTkwNDIxNzE1MDk0MTZfMjc0NTM3MzczNjA3OTg0NzIyMV9vLmpwZw==___.jpg  Shri Guru Pushkar Jain Devendra Calendar, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The new Chaitradiadi Vikram samvat (common in North India) starts seven months earier in Chaitra, thus during Chaitra-Kartika Krishna, the difference between Vikram and Vir Nivana samvat is 469 years.

The Jain business people traditionally started their accounting year from Diwali. The relationship between the Vir and Shaka era is given in Titthogali Painnaya and Dhavalaa by Acharya Virasena:&lt;ref&gt;Jain Sahitya aur Itihas par Vrihad Prakash, Jugalkishor Mukhtar, July 1956 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|पंच य मासा पंच य वास छच्चेव होन्ति वाससया &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;
परिणिव्वुअस्स अरिहितो तो उप्पन्नो सगो राया &lt;nowiki&gt;||&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

Thus the Nirvana occurred 605 years and 5 months before the Saka era.

==Jain Calendar==
The Jain calendar ([[Panchangam|Panchāng]]) is a [[lunisolar calendar]], just like the traditional Vikarm or Saka calendars .  The months based on the position of the [[Moon]] with respect to the Earth and it is adjusted by adding an extra month (adhika masa) once every three years, to coincide with the [[Sun]] to bring month in phase with the season.  Its day or date which is known as Tithi, indicates the moon phase and the month indicates the approximate season of the [[solar year]].

The [[lunisolar calendar]] has the following arrangement:
A regular or normal year has 12 months; a leap year has 13 months.
A regular or normal year has 353, 354, or 355 days; a leap year has 383, 384, or 385 days.

The average number of days in a month is 30 but the average number of days in a Lunisolar year is 354 and not 360 (12 months in a year) because it takes the Moon about 29.5 days (not 30 days) to complete the circle around the Earth.  Hence one Tithi is eliminated in about duration of two months.
The [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]], [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] lunar, [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]], and [[Tibetan calendar|Tibetan]] calendars are all lunisolar, and so were the Japanese calendars until 1873 and the Chinese calendars until 1912.

The Islamic calendar is a pure Lunar Calendar because its date (Tithi) indicates the moon phase but its months are not in phase with the time of the solar year or the season.  It does not adjust its calendar to coincide with the sun or the season.  Hence no extra month is added every three years.

[[Gregorian calendar|The Gregorian calendar]] (English CE) is a pure [[Solar calendar|Solar Calendar]] and its date indicates the time of the solar season but not the moon phase.

'''Wabokieshiek''' (translated '''White Cloud''', '''The Light''' or '''White Sky Light''' in English,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prophetstownpowwow.com/2.html ''Prophetstown Pow Wow'']&lt;/ref&gt; though ''Waapakiishik'' in the [[Fox language|Sauk language]] means "White Sky"{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}) (c. 1794 &amp;ndash; c. 1841) was an important [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] of the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago) and [[Sac (tribe)|Sauk]] tribes in 19th century [[Illinois]], playing a key role in the [[Black Hawk War]] of 1832.  Known as a [[medicine man]] and [[prophet]], he is sometimes called the '''Winnebago Prophet'''.

Wabokieshiek was born as ''Poweshiek'' to a Sauk father and a Ho-Chunk mother in the vicinity of [[Prophetstown, Illinois]], which is named after him.  Like his father, he was considered a Sac chief, and was also very influential among the Ho-Chunk, and he was known for his promotion of a traditional way of life among the local tribes. However, his influence waned after he promised/prophesied to Sauk/Fox chief [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]] that the British and other tribes (such as the Ho-Chunk and [[Potawatomi]]) would aid him against the United States in what became the Black Hawk War, a prediction that proved false.  At the end of the war, on August 27, 1832, Wabokieshiek was taken prisoner along with the remnant of Black Hawk's band. The prisoners were sent to [[Washington D.C.]] (meeting with [[Andrew Jackson]]) and then to [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]] in April, 1833.  On June 5, 1833, they were sent back West to be released; Wabokieshiek and his son were released at [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin]].  After this time, he lived quietly until he died circa 1841.

Wabokieshiek is sometimes confused with [[Red Cloud]], a [[Lakota people|Lakota]] chief, and [[Mahaska (Native American leader)|Mahaska]], an [[Ioway]] also called White Cloud.
