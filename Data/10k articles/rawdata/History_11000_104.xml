'''Agnes Baldwin Brett''' (née Baldwin 1876 – 1955) was an American [[numismatist]] and [[archaeologist]] who worked as the Curator at the [[American Numismatic Society]] from 1910 to 1913. She was the first curator at the [[American Numismatic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnes Baldwin Brett |url=http://numismatics.org/Archives/Baldwinbrettbio |website=American Numismatic Society |accessdate=4 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308091415/http://numismatics.org/Archives/Baldwinbrettbio |archivedate=8 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She made important contributions to the study of ancient coinage, medals, and sculpture, whose work (particularly on coinage) was used by later archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shear|first=Theodore Leslie|date=1925|title=Excavations at Corinth in 1925|jstor=497960|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=29|issue=4|pages=381–397|doi=10.2307/497960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett was also a visiting lecturer of archaeology at [[Columbia University]] in 1936.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">The '''Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910''' was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that aimed to improve the protection afforded to ancient monuments in Britain. 

==Details==

The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had begun the process of establishing legal protection for some of Britain's ancient monuments; these had all been prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] had continued this process, empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. In 1908 a royal commission concluded that there were gaps between these two pieces of legislation, and in 1910 the Ancient Monuments Protection Act was passed, allowing the Commissioners and Councils to receive ancient monuments as gifts, and making damaging the wider set of ancient monuments described in 1900 legislation a criminal offence in the same way as those covered by the 1882 legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

The operation of the combined legislation was felt to be unwieldy, and three years later the act was repealed, being replaced with the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Alexander Johann Milchhöfer''' (21 March 1852 – 7 December 1903) was a German [[archaeologist]] born in [[Kutuzovo, Krasnoznamensky District, Kaliningrad Oblast|Schirwindt]], [[East Prussia]], a village in the easternmost corner of the German Reich. He specialized in studies of [[Greek Antiquity]], and is remembered for his [[Topography as the study of place|topographical]] research of ancient [[Attica]].  
 
He studied in [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] and at the [[University of Munich]], where he was a student of [[Heinrich Brunn]] (1822–1894). Subsequently, he became an assistant to [[Ernst Curtius]] (1814–1896) in Berlin, and in 1883 was habilitated for [[archaeology]] at the [[University of Göttingen]]. Later on, he was an associate professor at the [[University of Münster]], where he was also in charge of the library of [[classical archaeology]]. In 1895 he became a professor of archaeology at the [[University of Kiel]].

== Published works ==
In his 1883 book "''Die Anfänge der Kunst in Griechenland''" (The Origins of Art in Greece), he was the first to suggest that [[Crete]] was the center of [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean culture]]. Other noted works on [[ancient Greece]] by Milchhöfer include:
* ''Die Stadtgeschichte von Athen'' (The history of the city of [[Athens]]), (1891); with [[Ernst Curtius]] (1814–1896).
* ''Karten von Attika'' (Charts of Attica), (1881–1903); with Curtius and [[Johann August Kaupert]] (1822–1899).

'''Astronomical year numbering''' is based on [[Anno Domini|AD]]/[[Common Era|CE]] year numbering, but follows normal [[decimal]] [[integer]] numbering more strictly. Thus, it has a [[0 (year)|year 0]]; the years before that are designated with [[negative number]]s and the years after that are designated with positive numbers.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html|title=Year Dating Conventions|last=Espenak|first=Fred|work=NASA Eclipse Web Site|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 February 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090208212742/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/dates.html| archivedate= 8 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomers use the [[Julian calendar]] for years before 1582, including the year 0, and the [[Gregorian calendar]] for years after 1582, as exemplified by [[Jacques Cassini]] (1740),&lt;ref name=Cassini&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA10 Tables Astronomiques]'' (1740), Explication et Usage pp. 5 (PA5), 7 (PA7), Tables pp. 10 (RA1-PA10), 22 (RA1-PA22), 63 (RA1-PA63), 77 (RA1-PA77), 91 (RA1-PA91), 105 (RA1-PA105), 119 (RA1-PA119). {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Newcomb]] (1898)&lt;ref&gt;Simon Newcomb, [https://archive.org/details/06AstronomicalPapersPreparedForTheUse "Tables of the Motion of the Earth on its Axis and Around the Sun"] in ''Astronomical Papers Prepared for the Use of the American Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac, Volume&amp;nbsp;VI: Tables of the Four Inner Planets'', (United States Naval Observatory, 1898), pp.&amp;nbsp;27 &amp;amp; 34&amp;ndash;35.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred Espenak]] (2007).&lt;ref name=Espanak&gt;Fred Espenak, [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html Phases of the Moon: −99 to 0 (100 to 1 BCE)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605101653/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases-0099.html |date=5 June 2009 }} ''NASA Eclipse web site''&lt;/ref&gt;

The prefix AD and the suffixes CE, BC or BCE (Common Era, Before Christ or Before Common Era) are dropped.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; The year 1 BC/BCE is numbered 0, the year 2 BC is numbered −1, and in general the year ''n'' BC/BCE is numbered "−(''n'' − 1)"&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; (a negative number equal to 1 − ''n''). The numbers of AD/CE years are not changed and are written with either no sign or a positive sign; thus in general ''n'' AD/CE is simply ''n'' or +''n''.&lt;ref name="nasa-eclipses" /&gt; For normal calculation a [[0 (number)|number zero]] is often needed, here most notably when calculating the number of years in a period that spans the [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]; the end years need only be subtracted from each other.

The system is so named due to its use in [[astronomy]]. Few other disciplines outside [[history]] deal with the time before year 1, some exceptions being [[dendrochronology]], [[archaeology]] and [[geology]], the latter two of which use '[[Before Present|years before the present]]'. Although the absolute numerical values of astronomical and historical years only differ by one before year 1, this difference is critical when calculating astronomical events like [[eclipses]] or [[planetary conjunction]]s to determine when historical events which mention them occurred.

==Year zero usage==
{{Main|Year zero}}
In his [[Rudolphine Tables]] (1627), [[Johannes Kepler]] used a prototype of year zero which he labeled ''Christi'' (Christ's) between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (Before Christ) and ''Post Christum'' (After Christ) on the mean motion tables for the Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler, ''[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae]'' (1627) Pars secunda, 42 (Zu Seite 191), 48 (197), 54 (203), 60 (209), 66 (215), 72 (221), 78 (227). (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1702, the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), and immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae - Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4. (Latin)&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick Teresi, [https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm "Zero"], ''The Atlantic'', July 1997 (see under Calendars and the Cosmos).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, [http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html "Calendars"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210184836/http://charon.nmsu.edu/~lhuber/leaphist.html |date=10 February 2012 }}, ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', ed. P. Kenneth Seidelmann, (Sausalito, California: University Science Books, 1992/2005) 579.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of Julian years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (before Jesus Christ or BC), and immediately before Julian years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (after Jesus Christ or AD).&lt;ref name=Cassini/&gt;

Cassini gave the following reasons for using a year 0:&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Cassini, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVIVAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PT30 Tables Astronomiques]'', Explication et Usage 5, translated by Wikipedia from the French:&lt;br&gt; "L'année 0 est celle dans laquelle on suppose qu'est né J. C. que plusieurs Chronologistes marquent 1 avant la naissance de J. C. &amp; que nous avons marquée 0, afin que la somme des années avant &amp; après J. C. donne l'intervalle qui est entre ces années, &amp; que les nombres disibles par 4 marquent les années bissextiles tant avant qu'après J. C."&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|The year 0 is that in which one supposes that Jesus Christ was born, which several chronologists mark 1 before the birth of Jesus Christ and which we marked 0, so that the sum of the years before and after Jesus Christ gives the interval which is between these years, and where numbers divisible by 4 mark the leap years as so many before or after Jesus Christ.|Jacques Cassini}}

Fred Espanak of [[NASA]] lists 50 phases of the moon within year 0, showing that it is a full year, not an instant in time.&lt;ref name=Espanak/&gt; Jean Meeus gives the following explanation:&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms'' (Richmod, Virginia: Willmann-Bell, 1991) 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is a disagreement between astronomers and historians about how to count the years preceding year 1. In [''Astronomical Algorithms''], the 'B.C.' years are counted astronomically. Thus, the year before the year +1 is the year zero, and the year preceding the latter is the year −1. The year which historians call 585 B.C. is actually the year −584.
The astronomical counting of the negative years is the only one suitable for arithmetical purpose. For example, in the historical practice of counting, the rule of divisibility by 4 revealing Julian leap-years no longer exists; these years are, indeed, 1, 5, 9, 13, ... B.C. In the astronomical sequence, however, these leap-years are called 0, −4, −8, −12, ..., and the rule of divisibility by 4 subsists.|Jean Meeus, ''Astronomical Algorithms''}}

==Signed years without year 0==
Although he used the usual French terms "avant J.-C." (before Jesus Christ) and "après J.-C." (after Jesus Christ) to label years elsewhere in his book, the Byzantine historian [[Venance Grumel]] used negative years (identified by a minus sign, −) to label BC years and unsigned positive years to label AD years in a table. He did so possibly to save space and put no year 0 between them.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1958) 30. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Version 1.0 of the [[XML Schema (W3C)|XML Schema language]], often used to describe data interchanged between computers in [[XML]], includes built-in primitive datatypes '''date''' and '''dateTime'''. Although these are defined in terms of [[ISO 8601]] which uses the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] and therefore should include a year 0, the XML Schema specification states that there is no year zero. Version 1.1 of the defining [[W3C recommendation|recommendation]] realigned the specification with ISO 8601 by including a year zero, despite the problems arising from the lack of [[backward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;Biron, P.V. &amp; Malhotra, A. (Eds.). (28 October 2004). [http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime ''XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes'' (2nd ed.).] World Wide Web Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Axum''' or '''Aksum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|k|s|uː|m}}; {{lang-ti|ኣኽሱም}} ''Ak̠ʷsəm''; {{lang-am|አክሱም}} ''Ak̠sum'') is a city in the northern part of [[Ethiopia]]. The town has a population of 56,500 residents (2010) and is governed as an urban [[Districts of Ethiopia|wäräda]].

The original capital of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], it is [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation#Africa|one of the oldest continuously inhabited places]] in Africa. Axum was a naval and trading power that ruled the region from about 400 BCE into the 10th century. In 1980, [[UNESCO]] added Axum's archaeological sites to its list of [[World Heritage Site]]s due to their historic value.

Axum is located in the [[Mehakelegnaw Zone]] of the [[Tigray Region]], near the base of the [[Adwa]] mountains. It has an elevation of {{convert|2131|m|ft}} and is surrounded by [[La'ilay Maychew]] ''wäräda''.

==History==
{{details|topic=the early history of Axum|Kingdom of Aksum}}
[[File:NE 565ad.jpg|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Aksum]] and other polities in 565]]
Axum was the centre of the marine trading power known as the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite Kingdom]], which predated the earliest mentions in [[ancient Rome|Roman-era]] writings. Around 356 CE, its ruler was converted to [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Christianity]] by [[Frumentius]]. Later, under the reign of [[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]], Axum was a quasi-ally of [[Byzantium]] against the [[Sasanian Empire]] which had adopted [[Zoroastrianism]]. The historical record is unclear, with ancient church records the primary contemporary sources.

It is believed it began a long and slow decline after the seventh century due partly to the Persians and then the Arabs contesting old [[Red Sea]] trade routes. Eventually Aksum was cut off from its principal markets in [[Alexandria]], Byzantium and [[Southern Europe]] and its trade share was captured by Arab traders of the era. The Kingdom of Aksum was finally destroyed by Empress [[Gudit]]{{Cn|date=July 2014}}, and eventually some of the people of Aksum were forced south and their old way of life declined. As the kingdom's power declined so did the influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline, similar to Rome and other cities thrust away from the flow of world events. The last known (nominal) king to reign was crowned in about the 10th century, but the kingdom's influence and power ended long before that.

Its decline in population and trade then contributed to the shift of the power center of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] south to the [[Agaw people|Agaw]] region as it moved further inland. The city of Axum was the administrative seat of an empire spanning one million square miles. Eventually, the alternative name (Ethiopia) was adopted by the central region, and subsequently, the present modern state.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mokhtar, ''UNESCO General History of Africa, Vol. II, Abridged Edition'' (Berkeley: University of Aksum Press, 1990), pp. 215-35. {{ISBN|0-85255-092-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Aksumite Kingdom and Ethiopian Church==
[[File:Church Our Lady Mary Zion Axum Ethio.jpg|thumb|250px|Dome and Belltower of the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]]]]
The Kingdom of Aksum had its own written language, [[Ge'ez]], and developed a distinctive architecture exemplified by giant obelisks, the oldest of which (though much smaller) date from 5000–2000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha'' (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 871.&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was at its height under King [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]], baptized as Abreha, in the 4th century (which was also when it officially embraced [[Christianity]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fage, J. D., ''A History of Africa'' (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 53–4. {{ISBN|0-415-25248-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Chapel of the Tablet]]
The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] claims that the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in Axum houses the Biblical [[Ark of the Covenant]], in which lie the [[Tablets of Stone]] upon which the [[Ten Commandments]] are inscribed.&lt;ref name=Hodd&gt;Hodd, Mike, ''Footprint East Africa Handbook'' (New York: Footprint Travel Guides, 2002), p. 859. {{ISBN|1-900949-65-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethiopian traditions suggest that it was from Axum that Makeda, the [[Queen of Sheba]], journeyed to visit King [[Solomon]] in Jerusalem and that the two had a son, [[Menelik I|Menelik]], who grew up in Ethiopia but traveled to Jerusalem as a young man to visit his father's homeland. He lived several years in Jerusalem before returning to his country with the Ark of the Covenant. According to the Ethiopian Church and Ethiopian tradition, the Ark still exists in Axum. This same church was the site where Ethiopian emperors were crowned for centuries until the reign of [[Fasilides]], then again beginning with [[Yohannes IV]] until the end of the empire. Axum is considered to be the holiest city in Ethiopia and is an important destination of pilgrimages.&lt;ref name=Hodd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Kay Davidson and David Gitlitz ''Pilgrimage, from the Ganges to Graceland: an Encyclopedia'' (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2002), 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Significant religious festivals are the [[Timkat]] festival (known as [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] in western Christianity) on 19 January (20 January in leap years) and the [[Festival of Maryam Zion]] on November 24.

In 1937, a 24-metre (79-foot) tall, 1,700-year-old [[Obelisk of Axum]], broken into five parts and lying on the ground, was found and shipped by [[Italy|Italian]] soldiers to [[Rome]] to be erected. The obelisk is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of engineering from the height of the Axumite empire. Despite a 1947 [[United Nations]] agreement that the obelisk would be shipped back, Italy balked, resulting in a long-standing diplomatic dispute with the Ethiopian government, which views the obelisk as a symbol of national identity. In April 2005, Italy finally returned the obelisk pieces to Axum amidst much official and public rejoicing; Italy also covered the $4 million costs of the transfer.  UNESCO assumed responsibility for the re-installation of this stele in Axum, and by the end of July 2008 the obelisk had been reinstalled (see panographic photos in external links below). It was unveiled on 4 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ethiopia unveils ancient obelisk |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7597589.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0016/001631/163173e.pdf |title=The Reinstallation of the Axum Obelisk |date=10 October 2008 |work= |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Axum and Islam==
The Kingdom of Aksum has a longstanding relationship with [[Islam]]. According to [[ibn Hisham]],&lt;ref&gt;ibn Hisham, ''The Life of the Prophet''&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Muhammad]] faced oppression from the [[Quraysh]] clan, he sent a small group that included his daughter [[Ruqayya]] and her husband [[Uthman]] to Axum. [[Sahama]], the Aksumite king,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nimer, Ph.D. |first=Muḥammad |title=Exegesis, Social Science and the Place of the Jews in the Qur’an |url=http://iiit.org/Research/ScholarsSummerInstitute/TableofContents/ExegesisSocialScienceandthePlaceoftheJews/tabid/246/Default.aspx |accessdate=23 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731091754/http://iiit.org/Research/ScholarsSummerInstitute/TableofContents/ExegesisSocialScienceandthePlaceoftheJews/tabid/246/Default.aspx |archivedate=31 July 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; gave them refuge and protection. He refused the requests of the Quraish clan to send these refugees back to Arabia. These refugees did not return until the sixth [[Hijri year]] (628), and even then many remained in Ethiopia, eventually settling at [[Negash]] in what is now the [[Misraqawi Zone]].{{Cn|date=July 2014}}

There are different traditions concerning the effect these early Muslims had on the ruler of Axum. The Muslim tradition is that the ruler of Axum was so impressed by these refugees that he became a secret convert.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq, ''The Life of Muhammad'' (Oxford, 1955), 657–58.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Arabic historians and Ethiopian tradition state that some of the Muslim refugees who lived in Ethiopia during this time converted to Orthodox Christianity. There is also a second Ethiopian tradition that, on the death of Ashama ibn Abjar, Muhammed is reported to have prayed for the king's soul, and told his followers, "Leave the Abyssinians in peace, as long as they do not take the offensive."&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 42f&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sights==
[[File:Axoum partie moderne.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Street in Axum]]
The major Aksumite monuments in the town are [[stele]]s. These obelisks are around 1,700 years old and have become a symbol of the Ethiopian people's identity.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Mission accomplished: Aksum Obelisk successfully reinstalled |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/456 |date=1 August 2008 |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number are in the [[Northern Stelae Park]], ranging up to the 33-metre-long (3.84 metres wide, 2.35 metres deep, weighing 520 tonnes) [[Great Stele]], believed to have fallen and broken during construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillipson |first=David W. |year=2003 |title=Aksum: An archaeological introduction and guide |journal=Azania: Archaeological Research in Africa |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=1–68 |doi=10.1080/00672700309480357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Obelisk of Axum]] (24.6 metres high, 2.32 metres wide, 1.36 metres deep, weighing 170 tonnes) was removed by the Italian army in 1937, and returned to Ethiopia in 2005 and reinstalled July 31, 2008.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; This stele was already broken into pieces before being shipped. The next tallest is the 24-metre (20.6 metres high above the front baseplate, 2.65 metres wide, 1.18 metres deep, weighing 160 tonnes) [[King Ezana's Stela]]. Three more stelae measure 18.2 metres high, 1.56 metres wide, 0.76 metres deep, weighing 56 tonnes; 15.8 metres high, 2.35 metres wide, one metre deep, weighing 75 tonnes; 15.3 metres high, 1.47 metres wide, 0.78 metres deep, weighing 43 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre, Chris ''Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World'' 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The stelae are believed to mark [[grave]]s and would have had cast metal discs affixed to their sides, which are also carved with architectural designs. The [[Gudit Stelae]] to the west of town, unlike the northern area, are interspersed with mostly 4th century [[tomb]]s.

[[File:Aksum-139457.jpg|thumb|Dungur]]
The other major feature of the town are the old and new [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]]. The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion was built in 1665 by Emperor [[Fasilides]] and said to have previously housed the Ark of the Covenant. The original cathedral, said to have been built by Ezana and augmented several times after was believed to have been massive with 12 naves. It was burned to the ground by Gudit, rebuilt, and then destroyed again during the [[Abyssinian–Adal war]] of the 1500s. It was again rebuilt by Emperor [[Gelawdewos]] (completed by his brother and successor Emperor [[Menas of Ethiopia|Minas]]) and Emperor Fasilides replaced that structure with the present one.  Only men are permitted entry into the Old St. Mary's Cathedral (some say as a result of the destruction of the original church by Gudit). The New Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion stands next to the old one, and was built to fulfill a pledge by Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] to Our Lady of Zion for the liberation of Ethiopia from the Fascist occupation.  Built in a neo-Byzantine style, work on the new cathedral began in 1955, and allows admittance to women. Emperor Haile Selassie interrupted the state visit of Britain's Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to travel to Axum to attend the dedication of the new Cathedral and pay personal homage, showing the importance of this church in the Ethiopian Empire. The Queen visited the Cathedral a few days later.  Between the two cathedrals is a small chapel known as The Chapel of the Tablet built at the same time as the new cathedral, and which is believed to house the Ark of the Covenant. Emperor Haile Selassie's consort, Empress [[Menen Asfaw]], paid for its construction from her private funds. Admittance to the chapel is closed to all but the guardian monk who resides there. Entrance is even forbidden to the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, and to the Emperor of Ethiopia during the monarchy. The two cathedrals and the chapel of the Ark are the focus of pilgrimage and considered the holiest sites in Ethiopia to members of its Orthodox Church.

Other attractions in Axum include archaeological and ethnographic museums, the [[Ezana Stone]] written in [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]], Ge'ez and [[Ancient Greek]] in a similar manner to the [[Rosetta Stone]], [[King Bazen's Tomb]] (a [[megalith]] considered to be one of the earliest structures), the so-called [[Queen of Sheba's Bath]] (actually a [[reservoir]]), the 4th-century [[Ta'akha Maryam]] and 6th-century [[Dungur]] palaces, [[Pentalewon Monastery]] and [[Abba Liqanos]] and the [[Lioness of Gobedra]] [[rock art]]

Local legend claims the Queen of Sheba lived in the town.

{{italic title}}
[[File:Reichsparteitagnov1935.jpg|thumb|Adolf Hitler reviewing [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] members in 1935. He is accompanied by the ''Blutfahne'' and its bearer [[SS]]-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Jakob Grimminger]].]]

The '''''Blutfahne''''' ({{IPA-de|bluːtˈfaːnə|pron}}), or '''Blood Flag''', is a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] ''Hakenkreuz'' ([[swastika]]) flag that was carried during the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in [[Munich]], Germany on 9 November 1923, during which it became soaked in the blood of one of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] men who died. It subsequently became one of the most revered objects of the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi Party). It was used in ceremonies in which new flags for party organizations were consecrated by the Blood Flag when touched by it.

==Beer Hall Putsch==
{{main|Beer Hall Putsch}}
The flag was that of the 5th [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] ''Sturm'', which was carried in the march towards the ''[[Feldherrnhalle]]''. When the Munich police fired on the Nazis, the flagbearer Heinrich Trambauer was hit and dropped the flag. [[Andreas Bauriedl]], an SA man marching alongside the flag, was killed and fell onto it, staining the flag with his blood.&lt;ref name = hoff&gt;[[Hilmar Hoffmann]], ''The Triumph of Propaganda: Film and National Socialism, 1933-1945, Volume 1'', pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There were two stories about what happened to the flag in the aftermath of the [[Putsch]]: one was that the wounded flagbearer Heinrich Trambauer took the flag to a friend where he removed it from its staff before leaving with it hidden inside his jacket and later giving it to a Karl Eggers for safekeeping. The other story was that the flag was confiscated by the Munich authorities and was later returned to the Nazis via Eggers. In the mid-1930s, after a myth emerged that Bauriedl had been carrying the flag, an investigation by Nazi archivists concluded that Trambauer was the standard-bearer and that the flag had been concealed by an SA man, not taken by the police, though they had confiscated other flags which they later returned.&lt;ref&gt;Jay W. Baird, ''To Die for Germany: Heroes in the Nazi Pantheon'', Indiana University Press, 1992, p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of which story was the correct one, after [[Adolf Hitler]] was released from [[Landsberg prison]] (having served nine months of a five-year prison sentence for his part in the putsch), Eggers gave the flag to him.

==Sacred Nazi symbol==
After Hitler received the flag, he had it fitted to a new staff and [[finial]]; just below the finial was a silver dedication sleeve which bore the names of the 16 dead participants of the putsch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trueman|first1=Chris|title=The Beer Hall Putsch of 1923|url=http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/beer_hall_putsch_of_1923.htm|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauriedl was one of the 16 honorees.  In addition, the flag was no longer attached to the staff by its original sewn-in sleeve, but by a red-white-black intertwined cord which ran through the sleeve instead.

In 1926, at the second Nazi Party congress at Weimar, Hitler ceremonially bestowed the flag on [[Joseph Berchtold]], then head of the SS.&lt;ref name= hoff/&gt; The flag was thereafter treated as a sacred object by the Nazi Party and carried by [[SS]]-''[[Sturmbannführer]]'' [[Jakob Grimminger]] at various Nazi Party ceremonies. One of the most visible uses of the flag was when Hitler, at the Party's annual [[Nuremberg]] rallies, touched other Nazi banners with the ''Blutfahne'', thereby "sanctifying" them.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Denis G.G. Lepage, ''An Illustrated Dictionary of the Third Reich'', McFarland, 24 Dec 2013, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This was done in a special ceremony called the "flag consecration" (''Fahnenweihe'').&lt;ref name = hoff/&gt;

When not in use, the ''Blutfahne'' was kept at the headquarters of the Nazi Party in Munich (the [[Brown House, Munich, Germany|Brown House]]) with an SS guard of honour. The flag had a small tear in it, believed to have been caused during the Putsch, that went unrepaired for a number of years.

==Disappearance==
The ''Blutfahne'' was last seen in public at the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' induction ceremony on 18 October 1944 (''not'', as frequently reported, at ''[[Gauleiter]]'' [[Adolf Wagner]]'s funeral six months previously). This ceremony was conducted by [[Heinrich Himmler]] and attended by [[Wilhelm Keitel]], [[Heinz Guderian]], [[Hans Lammers]], [[Martin Bormann]], [[Karl Fiehler]], [[Wilhelm Schepmann]] and [[Erwin Kraus]].

After this last public display, the ''Blutfahne'' vanished. Its current whereabouts are unknown. However, it is speculated to have been destroyed by fire during the destruction of the Brown House in Munich in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Brian L. Davis, ''Flags of the Third Reich (3): Party &amp; Police Units'', Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Martin's original academic field was stratospheric modelling and numerical methods. He has published extensively about the social dynamics and politicisation of controversial scientific topics. His topics of inquiry have included the globalization of polarised science such as the [[origin of HIV/AIDS]] {{cn|date=June 2018}}. He argues that there are situations in which scientific research that threatens vested interests can be suppressed. He identifies a number of direct and indirect mechanisms through which this can occur, ranging from the denial of funds and the denial of promotion and tenure, through to the creation of a "general climate of fear".&lt;ref&gt;Hess, David J. (1997). ''Science Studies: An Advanced Introduction'', NYU Press (U.S.A.). {{ISBN|9780814735640}}. p152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin has been criticised for being a supporter of the now-discredited [[OPV AIDS hypothesis|theory of OPV-AIDS]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Tools for Critical Thinking in Biology |last=Jenkins |first=Stephen H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-19-998104-5 |location=New York |pages=217–219}} text= "Although Hooper and Martin are still promoting the tainted polio vaccine hypothesis, recent genetic work has convincingly disproven it... Worobey's team published their genetic comparison of HIV samples in 2008, but Brian Martin continued to promote the tainted polio vaccine hypothesis for the origin of AIDS as late as 2010 in a paper called "How to Attack a Scientific Theory and Get Away with It (Usually)..." p 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/debunked-polio-vaccine-and-hiv-link |title=Debunked: The Polio Vaccine and HIV Link |date=21 January 2016 |website=College of Physicians of Philadelphia - historyofvaccines.org |access-date=12 March 2016 |author=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hammar |first=Lawrence |date=1 April 2004 |title=Dephlogistication, Imperial Display, Apes, Angels, and the Return of Monsieur Emile Zola |url=http://www.uow.edu.au/~bmartin/dissent/documents/AIDS/Hammar04.pdf |journal=Papua New Guinea Medical Journal |volume= 47| issue = 1–2|pages=120, 124 |access-date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis was first popularised in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine by way of journalist Curtis and AIDS activist Elswood in 1992, and was later further promoted by the journalist/writer Hooper and Martin,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Curtis, Tom |title=The Origin of AIDS: A startling new theory attempts to answer the question, 'Was it an act of God or an act of man? |work=[[Rolling Stone]] magazine |issue=626 |pages=54–9, 61, 106, 108 |date=19 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Hooper crediting Martin for giving the OPV-AIDS link hypothesis "further publicity and credibility".&lt;ref name="hooper-river"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The River: A Journey Back to the Source of HIV and AIDS |last=Hooper |first=Edward |publisher=Little Brown and Company |year=1999 |isbn=0-316-37261-7 |location=(U.S.A.) |pages=797}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin disputes the claim that he has been a supporter of the hypothesis, instead saying that he has "never argued in favour of the OPV theory", but has instead stated "that it was and remains worthy of consideration yet in many ways has been unfairly dismissed".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Brian. (16 May 2016). "[http://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/AIDS/Martin16.pdf Critical thinking about the origin of AIDS: Comments on Stephen Jenkins’ account]". Retrieved 26 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 article in ''[[The Australian]]'' described Martin's 2010 paper as claiming "that medical researchers had colluded to silence the theory that the AIDS virus was caused by contaminated polio vaccines in 1950s Africa."&lt;ref name="Australian-spruik" /&gt;

Martin has been active in the criticism of university systems. He has been critical of conflicts of interest within universities where they are managing internal investigations which may lead to bad publicity, and recommends having independent groups investigating allegations of misconduct;&lt;ref name=abc-unsw&gt;{{cite news |title=PM: Investigations mounting into research at University of New South Wales |author=Colvin, Mark |work=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Radio]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2014/s3988043.htm |date=17 April 2014 |accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; he has written about the unauthorised use of research produced by students and junior researchers by senior academics;&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, David. (22 October 2015). "[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/papers-retracted-after-authors-used-unauthorised-data-from-junior-researchers Papers retracted after authors used unauthorised data from junior researchers]", ''[[Times Higher Education]]'', London.

Martin believes that if complainants go through the official channels the outcome is very predictable, in that organisation's internal grievance procedures or making a complaint to the relevant ombudsman doesn't work.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; He also believes whistleblower laws also don't work, saying; "Not only are whistleblower laws flawed through exemptions and in-built weaknesses but in their implementation they are rarely helpful".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.topsecretwriters.com/2014/12/whistleblower-protection-act-really-protect/ |title=Who Does The Whistleblower Protection Act Really Protect? |author=Pickard, Gabrielle |date=25 December 2014 |website=Top Secret Writers |location=(U.S.A.) |language=en-US |access-date=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Martin has been criticised for his role in the [[Judith Wilyman PhD controversy]]&lt;ref name="australian-conference"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/university-paid-for-anti-vaccine-student-to-attend-conference/story-e6frgcjx-1226811558843 |title=University paid for anti-vaccine student to attend conference |last=Morton |first=Rick |date=28 January 2014 |access-date=22 January 2016 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; where medical academics and the [[Australian Medical Association|AMA]] raised concerns of whether Professor Martin had the necessary knowledge&lt;ref name="TheAus-MartinMartin"/&gt; to assess the topic of [[vaccine]] science.&lt;ref name="Australian-spruik"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/antivaccination-activists-spruik-phd-thesis-as-proof-of-conspiracy/news-story/d74552da1a6875e2b0eea290094b590b |title=Anti-vaccination activists spruik PhD thesis as proof of conspiracy |last=Loussikian |first=Kylar |date=16 January 2016|work=[[The Australian]] |access-date=17 January 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Gorski]] has criticised Martin, claiming that he is not distinguishing between [[Vaccine controversies|dissent]] based on facts, science and logic as opposed to dissent based on pseudoscience and misinformation,&lt;ref name="Scienceblogs2016-01-14"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brian Martin and Judy Wilyman: Promoting antivaccine pseudoscience as "dissent" |url=http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2016/01/14/brian-martin-and-judy-wilyman-promoting-antivaccine-pseudoscience-as-dissent/ |author=Gorski, David |website=[[Science Blogs]] |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Australian]]'' has criticised him as not recognising [[academic rigour]] over [[academic freedom]].&lt;ref name="TheAus-MartinMartin"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/high-wired/when-fulltime-isnt-quite-that-and-queenslands-vet-goes-to-kerala/news-story/f142aded8b41660201b71f41b96243c1 |title=When fulltime isn't quite that, and Queensland's VET goes to Kerala |date=2 February 2016 |work=[[The Australian]] |access-date=2 February 2016 |author=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Martin published a paper characterizing criticism of [[Andrew Wakefield]]'s [[MMR vaccine controversy|discredited claims about vaccines and autism]] as being "suppression of vaccination dissent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Brian|title=On the Suppression of Vaccination Dissent|journal=[[Science and Engineering Ethics]]|date=2015|volume=21|issue=1|pages=143–157|doi=10.1007/s11948-014-9530-3|url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/15see.html}} Published online: 23 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016 ''[[:fr:Agence Science-Presse|Agence Science Presse]]'', reporting on the Wilyman matter, said that Martin "also defends the idea of a vaccine-autism link."&lt;ref name="Lapointe"&gt;{{Cite news |title=L'anti-vaccination à l'université |url=http://www.sciencepresse.qc.ca/actualite/2016/01/15/lanti-vaccination-luniversite |last=Lapointe |first=Pascal |work=[[:fr:Agence Science-Presse|Agence Science Presse]] |date=15 January 2016 |access-date=17 March 2016 |location=Quebec, CA}} translation= "The professor she chose as supervisor, Brian Martin, is known for his belief in a conspiracy to silence and hide the study that the AIDS virus was caused by the polio vaccine. And he also defends the idea of a vaccine-autism link."&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Martin disputes this claim stating, "I have never defended this idea."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Brian|date=June 2018|title=Persistent Bias on Wikipedia: Methods and Responses|journal=Social Science Computer Review|volume=36|issue=3|pages=379–388|doi=10.1177/0894439317715434}} [http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/17sscr.html Author's preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016 the [[Australian Skeptics]] criticised Martin's supervision of Wilyman by presenting Martin, Wilyman and the Social Sciences Department of the University of Wollongong the satirical [[Bent Spoon Award]] for awarding "a PhD thesis riddled with errors, misstatements, poor and unsupported 'evidence' and conspiratorial thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Skeptics awards – Spoon to Wilyman, Skeptic of the Year to Harvey and Vickers|url=http://www.skeptics.com.au/2016/11/28/2016-skeptics-awards-spoon-to-wilyman-skeptic-of-the-year-to-harvey-and-vickers/|website=www.skeptics.com.au|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptics name winners of Bent Spoon award|url=http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/News/Skeptics-name-winners-of-Bent-Spoon-award|website=pharmacynews.com.au|accessdate=28 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129082741/http://www.pharmacynews.com.au/News/Skeptics-name-winners-of-Bent-Spoon-award|archivedate=29 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Byzantine law''' was essentially a continuation of [[Roman law]] with increased [[Christian]] influence. Most sources define ''Byzantine law'' as the Roman legal traditions starting after the reign of [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century and ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the 15th century.

Though during and after the [[European Renaissance]] Western legal practices were heavily influenced by ''[[Justinian's Code]]'' (the ''Corpus Juris Civilis'') and Roman law during classical times,&lt;ref&gt;http://globalconnections.champlain.edu/2015/04/17/the-justinian-code-and-its-influence/&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine law nevertheless had substantial influence on Western traditions during the [[Middle Ages]] and after.

The most important work of Byzantine law was the [[Ecloga]], issued by [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], the first major Roman-Byzantine legal code issued in Greek rather than Latin. Soon after the ''Farmer's Law'' was established regulating legal standards outside the cities. While the Ecloga was influential throughout the Mediterranean (and Europe) because of the importance of Constantinople as a trading center, the Farmer's Law was a seminal influence on Slavic legal traditions including [[Law of Russia|those of Russia]].

==Influences and sources==
Byzantium inherited its main political, cultural and social institutions from Rome. Similarly, Roman law constituted the basis for the Byzantine legal system. For many centuries, the two great codifications of Roman law, carried out by [[Theodosius II]] and [[Justinian I|Justinian]] respectively, were the cornerstones of Byzantine legislation. Of course, over the years these Roman codes were adjusted to the current circumstances, and then replaced by new codifications, written in Greek. However, the influence of Roman law persisted, and it is obvious in codifications, such as ''[[Basilika]]'', which was based on ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''. In the 11th century, [[Michael Psellos]] prides himself for being acquainted with the Roman legal legacy ("Ἰταλῶν σοφία").&lt;ref&gt;A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the late Roman legal tradition, the main source of law (''fons legum'') in Byzantium remained the enactments of the emperors. The latter initiated some major codifications of the Roman law, but they also issued their own "new laws", the ''Novels'' ("Novellae", "Νεαραὶ"). In early Byzantine (late Roman) era the legislative interest of the emperors intensified, and laws were now regulating the main aspects of public, private, economic and social life.&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Fögen, "Legislation in Byzantium", pp. 53&amp;ndash;54; R. Morris, "Dispute Settlement", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 399&amp;ndash;400.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Constantine I]] was the first to regulate divorce and Theodosius I intervened in faith issues, imposing a specific version of the [[Apostles' Creed|Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;M.T. Fögen, "Legislation in Byzantium", pp. 56, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Diocletian]] to [[Theodosius I]], namely during approximately 100 years, more than 2,000 laws were issued. Justinian alone promulgated approximately 600 laws. Gradually, the legislative enthusiasm receded, but still some of the laws of later emperors, such as [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo III]]'s ''Novels'', are of particular importance.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cameron, ''The Byzantines'', p. 153; M.T. Fögen, "Legislation in Byzantium", pp. 53&amp;ndash;54.&lt;/ref&gt; Custom continued to play a limited role as a secondary source of law, but written legislation had a precedence.&lt;ref&gt;R. Morris, "Dispute Settlement", 126; G. Mousourakis, ''Context of Roman Law'', pp. 401&amp;ndash;402.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Byzantine period ==
There is no definitively established date for when the so-called ''Byzantine'' period of Roman history begins. During the 4th, 5th, and 6th centuries the Empire was split and united administratively more than once. But it was during this period that Constantinople was first established and the East gained its own identity administratively; thus, it is often considered the ''early'' Byzantine period. Despite this, though, the legal developments during this period are typically considered part of ''Roman'' Law, as opposed to ''Byzantine'' Law, in part because legal documents during this period were still written in Latin. These developments, nevertheless, were key steps in the formation of Byzantine Law.

===Codex Theodosianus===
{{main article|Codex Theodosianus}}

In 438, Emperor Theodosius published the [[Codex Theodosianus]], which consisted of 16 books, containing all standing laws from the age of [[Constantine I]] till then.

=== Corpus Iuris Civilis ===
{{main article|Corpus Iuris Civilis}}

Soon after his accession in 527, [[Justinian]] appointed a commission to collect and codify existing Roman law. A second commission, headed by the jurist [[Tribonian]], was appointed in 530 to select matter of permanent value from the works of the jurists, to edit it and to arrange it into 50 books. In 533 this commission produced the ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digest]]a''.

Although Law as practiced in Rome had grown up as a type of case law, this was not the "Roman Law" known to the Medieval, or modern world. Now Roman law claims to be based on abstract principles of justice that were made into actual rules of law by legislative authority of the emperor or the Roman people. These ideas were transmitted to the Middle Ages in the great codification of Roman law carried throughout by the emperor Justinian. The [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]] was issued in Latin in three parts: the [[Institutes of Justinian|Institutes]], the Digest (Pandects), and the Code (Codex). It was the last major legal document written in Latin.

Two of the world's most widespread legal systems, [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] are based on the Corpus (in, for instance, most of Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa, [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Quebec law|Quebec]] and [[Louisiana law|Louisiana]]).

== Middle Byzantine period ==
Following Justinian's reign the Empire entered a period of rapid decline partially enabling the Arab conquests which would further weaken the Empire. Knowledge of Latin, which had been in decline since the fall of the West, virtually disappeared making many of the old legal codices almost inaccessible. These developments contributed to a dramatic weakening of legal standards in the Empire and a substantial drop in the standards of legal scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mousourakis|first=George|title=The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law|isbn=0-7546-2108-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qE1zFHyGXoC|pages=402–403}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal practice would become much more ''pragmatic'' and, as knowledge of [[Latin language|Latin]] in the Empire waned, direct use of Justinian's ''"Corpus Juris Civilis"'' would be abandoned in favor of summaries, commentaries, and new compilations written in [[Medieval Greek|Greek]].

=== Ecloga ===
The changes in the internal life of the empire which occurred in the years following the publication of Justinian's code called for a review of the legislation, so as for the requirements of the times should be met. Within the framework of the reforms [[Leo III the Isaurian]], (the first [[Isauria]]n emperor), introduced, he provided also for the modification of current laws. In 726 he issued the "Ecloga", that bore his name as well as the name of his son Constantine.
"Ecloga", referring to both the civil and criminal law, constituted, as was declared in the title a "rectification (of the Justinian legislation) towards a more philanthropic version". The membership of the editing committee is not known, but its primary mission, however, was, on the one hand, to modify those dispositions not in step with the times and, on the other, to provide judges with a concise legal handbook to help them dispense justice properly.

The dispositions of "Ecloga", influenced by the Christian spirit, as well as by the [[common law]], protected and supported the institution of marriage, increased the rights of wives and legal children, and introduced the equality of all citizens before the law. On the other hand, the penalties of amputation and blindness were introduced, reflecting the Byzantine concept in this period of changes{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}. By means of his "Ecloga" Leo addressed the judges also, inviting them ''"neither the poor to despise nor the ones unjust to let uncontrolled"''. Besides, in his effort to deter bribery in the execution of their duties he made their payment local and payable by the imperial treasury. "Ecloga" constituted the basic handbook of justice dispensation up to the days of the Macedonian emperors, that also assumed legislative activity, whereas later it influenced the ecclesiastic law of the Russian Orthodox Church. Formerly the researchers attributed the juridical collections ''"Farmer's Law", "Rhodian Sea Law"'' and ''"Military Laws"'' to [[Leo III the Isaurian]]. These views, however, are no longer valid.

=== The Farmer's Laws ===
With the exception of a few cities, and especially [[Constantinople]], where other types of urban economic activities were also developed, Byzantine society remained at its heart agricultural.  An important source regarding law, which reflects in a particularly characteristic way the internal life of the Byzantine villages during the Middle Byzantine Era (7th – end of 12th century) is the ''Nomos Georgikos'', also known as the ''Lex Rustica'' or ''Farmer's Law''. Due to its importance, the ''Farmer's Law'' roused the interest of researchers from a very early stage. Ever since it has been one of the most discussed texts concerning the internal history of Byzantium. It has been suggested that, because of the major influences caused by the influx of Slavs into the Empire at the time the Farmer's Law was established, Slavic traditions were in fact an important influence of the Farmer's Law, both in terms of why it was developed and its content.&lt;ref&gt;J. Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century'', pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a private collection, continuously enriched, and refers to specific cases relevant to rural property within the framework of the Byzantine rural "community". As evident by the dispositions of the "Law", peasants were organized in "communities" and collectively responsible for the payment of the total tax the "community" was liable for, being obliged to pay as well the amounts corresponding to indebted members of the community. As for the chronology of its writing, since the text itself bears no specific date, it is placed somewhere in between the second half of the 6th century and the middle of the 14th. Very early on, it was acknowledged as a legal handbook of great importance and greatly influenced much of the law of the Slavic countries and especially [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Russia]].

=== The Sea Laws ===
Dating  problems, similar to the ones of the ''"Farmer's Law"'', presents a code of equal character, the "Rhodian Sea Law" (''Nomos Rhodion Nautikos''). Written probably between 600 and 800, it is a collection of [[maritime law]] regulations divided into three parts. The first part refers to the ratification of the "Naval Law" by the Roman emperors. The second specifies the participation of the crew in maritime profits and the regulations valid on the ship, while the third and largest refers to maritime law, as for example to the apportionment of responsibility in case of theft or damage to the cargo or the ship. The ''"Naval Law"'' was included in the ''Basilika'' of [[Leo VI the Wise]] as a complement to book 53.

=== Ecclesiastical law ===
In accordance with the model of the secular legal associations, the canons of the ecclesiastic councils concerned ecclesiastic issues and  regulated the conduct of the clergy, as well as of the secular as concerned matters of belief. The "In Trullo" or "Fifth-Sixth Council", known for its canons, was convened in the years of Justinian II (691-692) and occupied itself exclusively with matters of discipline. The aim of the synod was to cover the gaps left in canon law by the previous Fifth (553)and Sixth [[Ecumenical Councils]].

This collection of canons was divided into four parts:

a) The canons ratifying the doctrinal decisions of the first six ecumenical councils along with the teachings of the Fathers of the Church.

b) The canons specifying the obligations of the ministrational clergy.

c) The canons referring to the monks.

d) The canons referring to the secular. The influence of these canons carried on in the future and they were extensively annotated by Balsamon, Zonaras and Aristenos, the three great ecclesiastic jurists of the 12th century.

There were also other [[Ancient Church Orders]] no longer extant in Greek. Later, more-scientific collections emerged, including:

* The ''[[Nomocanon]]'' of [[John Scholasticus]], from the 6th century 
* The ''Nomocanon'' in 14 titles of [[Heraclius]], from the 7th century
* The ''Nomocanon'' of [[Photios]], from the 9th century
* The ''Syntagma'' of [[Theodore Balsamon]] and his ''Scholia'' to the ''Nomocanon'' of Photios, from the 12th century
* The ''Synopsis Canonum'' by [[Alexios Aristenos]], from the 12th century

All of these books were compiled later by the [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] monk Saint [[Nicodemus the Hagiorite]] and became the basis of the modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] law, his ''[[Pedalion]]''.

== Later Byzantine law ==
The following legal texts were prepared in the later Byzantine Empire:
* The ''Prochiron'' of Basil the Macedonian, c. 870&lt;ref name="Mears"&gt;Lambert Mears, Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, pp. 64-66&lt;/ref&gt; or 872,&lt;ref name="Laiou"&gt;Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; which invalidates parts of the ''Ecloga'' and restores Justinians Laws, as well as Hellenising arcane Latin expressions.
* The ''Epanagoge'' (repetita proelectio legis),&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt; also of [[Basil I|Basil the Macedonian]], together with his sons, a second edition of the Prochiron, c.879 - 886&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;
* The ''Eisagoge'' of Photios, which includes novel law, c.880&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt;
* The ''[[Basilika|Basilicae]]'' (repurgatio veterum legum) or ''Basilics'' of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo the Philosopher]], together with his brother [[Alexander (Byzantine emperor)|Alexander]] and [[Constantine VII]], c.900&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt; or 906-11,&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt; which attempts to synthesise 6th century commentaries and glosses on Justinians laws by headings, and remove contradictions.  By the 11th century, the Basilics had replaced Justinian's laws as the primary source of Roman law.
* The ''Synopsis (Basilicorum) maior'', an abridgment of the ''Basilika'' from the late 9th century&lt;ref&gt;G. Mousourakis, Roman Law and the Origins of the Civil Law Tradition, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Epitome Legum'', later known as the Epitome ad Prochiron mutata, a synthesis of Justinian and the Epanagoge, c. 920-1&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt;
* The ''Epanagoge aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Epanagogue from c.11th century.&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;
* The ''Prochiron aucta'', a revision of the 9th century Prochiron from c.13th century.&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt;
* The ''Hexabiblos'', a 14th-century compilation of the above books made by [[Constantine Harmenopoulos]], a judge in [[Thessalonica]]
* The ''Hexabiblos aucta'', a late 14th century revision of Harmenopoulos' work by  Ioannes Holobolos
Other jurists (including at least one Emperor) prepared private collections of cases and commentaries,&lt;ref name="Mears" /&gt; but these did not form the body of law used by jurists at large.  It is held that the ''113 Novels of Leo the Wise'' fall into this category.&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt;

Lokin&lt;ref name="Laiou" /&gt; argues that while later legal texts tended to rearrange or explain the 6th century work of Justinian, rather than create new law, they did alter the locus of authority for law (''legis vigor'') from the Emperor to God.  In Justinian's work, Mosaïc Law and God's authority ''support'' the Emperor, and are consultative, but do not temper his absolute authority.  This process has already begun in the  ''Ecloga'', which states law is God-given by way of Isaiah 8:20, and is made explicit first in the Prochiron.&lt;ref&gt;Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;  There was, however, 'legislative creep' over this period, where the redaction of old laws and case law created new laws in effect, although not explicitly cited as such.&lt;ref&gt;Laiou and Simon (eds), Law and Society in Byzantium: Ninth-twelfth Centuries, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
During the early Middle Ages Roman/Byzantine Law played a major role throughout the Mediterranean region and much of Europe because of the economic and military importance of the Empire.

The [[Syro-Roman law book]], a Syriac translation of a Greek original from the 5th century, was highly influential in eastern Christian communities after the early Muslim conquests. It was based on Roman case law and imperial statutes from the east of the empire.

After the Islamic conquests of the Eastern Mediterranean, the Islamic caliphates gradually codified their legal systems using Roman/Byzantine law as an important model. It has been suggested in fact that it was the publication of the Ecloga that spurred the first major codification of Islamic imperial law.&lt;ref&gt;B. Jokisch, ''Islamic Imperial Law: Harun-Al-Rashid's Codification Project'', pp. 484-485.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavic legal traditions, including countries ranging from [[Bulgaria]] to [[Russia]], were substantially influenced by the Farmer's Law. To a lesser extent the Ecloga and other Byzantine codices influenced these areas as well. During the 18th and 19th centuries, as Russia increased its contact with the West, Justinian's Code began to be studied thus bringing in this influence.

In Western Europe, following the fall of the Roman Empire, the influence of Roman/Byzantine law became more indirect though always significant during much of the Middle Ages. During the European Renaissance, Western scholars embraced Justinian's Code as a basis for jurisprudence, shunning many of the later legal developments of the Byzantine Empire such as the Ecloga. This was to a great extent affected by the East/West ([[Roman Catholic]] vs. [[Eastern Orthodox]]) split in the Church. The perception in the West was that Roman law that was recorded in Latin was truly ''Roman'' whereas later laws written in Greek was distinct and foreign.

'''Frederick Bligh Bond''' (30 June 1864 – 8 March 1945),&lt;ref name='ans'&gt;{{Cite web| title=Frederick Bligh Bond | work=Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3403800726.html| accessdate=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; generally known by his second given name ''Bligh'',  was an English [[architect]], [[illustrator]], [[archaeologist]] and [[Parapsychology|psychical researcher]].

==Early life==
Bligh Bond was the son of the Rev. Frederick Hookey Bond. He was born in the [[Wiltshire]] town of [[Marlborough, Wiltshire|Marlborough]]. His family was related to [[William Bligh]], through his nephew [[Francis Godolphin Bond]], Bligh Bond's grandfather. He was also a cousin of [[Sabine Baring-Gould]].&lt;ref name='fortean'&gt;{{Cite web|title=Glastonbury Enigma |work=Fortean Times |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/143_blighbond.shtml |accessdate=2007-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030727035211/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/143_blighbond.shtml |archivedate=27 July 2003 |df= }} (Free registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home by his father, who was headmaster of the [[Marlborough Royal Free Grammar School]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Rediscovery of Glastonbury: Frederick Bligh Bond Architect of the New Age'' by Tim Hopkinson-Ball, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural practice==
[[Image:Cossham Memorial Hospital, Bristol.jpg|thumb|Bligh Bond's Cossham Memorial Hospital]]
He practised as an architect in [[Bristol]] from 1888. His work includes schools, such as the [[board school]]s in [[Barton Hill, Bristol|Barton Hill]], [[Easton, Bristol|Easton]], and [[Southville, Bristol|Southville]], Greenbank Elementary School and St George's School. He designed the schools of medicine and engineering at [[Bristol University]] and the Music School of [[Clifton College]]. He also undertook a number of domestic commissions for the [[King's Weston]] estate of [[Philip Napier Miles]], including a number of substantial houses in [[Shirehampton]], the Miles Arms public house in Avonmouth, the now-demolished King's Weston estate office and the public hall in Shirehampton.&lt;ref name='digbris'&gt;{{Cite web| title=A 'Colourful' Bristol Architect | work=Digital Bristol | url=http://www.digitalbristol.org/members/shireweb/blighbnd.htm | accessdate=2007-05-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512153133/http://www.digitalbristol.org/members/shireweb/blighbnd.htm|archivedate=12 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cossham Memorial Hospital]] is also an example of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Handel Cossham Memorial Hospital    | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379950 | accessdate=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style of his mature works in the Edwardian years might be described as English Baroque or Queen Anne Revival. In addition he oversaw the restoration of a number of churches, became an acknowledged authority on the history of church architecture, and in 1909 published, with Dom [[Bede Camm]], a two-volume treatise entitled ''Roodscreens and Roodlofts''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=Select bibliography: churches, their furnishings, and use| work=The Ecclesiological Society| url=http://www.ecclsoc.org/selectbibliography.html| accessdate=2007-05-10| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809123109/http://www.ecclsoc.org/selectbibliography.html| archivedate=9 August 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glastonbury excavations==

[[Image:Glastonburyabbey.jpg|thumb|Glastonbury Abbey]]

As early as 1899 Bligh Bond had expressed his belief that the dimensions of the buildings at Glastonbury Abbey were based on [[gematria]],&lt;ref name='digbris'/&gt; and in 1917 he published, with Thomas Simcox Lea, ''Gematria, A Preliminary Investigation of the Cabala contained in the Coptic Gnostic Books and of a similar Gematria in the Greek text of the New Testament'', which incorporated his own previously published paper, ''The Geometric Cubit as a Basis of Proportion in the Plans of Mediaeval Buildings''.&lt;ref name='ans'/&gt;

In 1908 the [[Church of England]] appointed him director of excavations at [[Glastonbury Abbey]].&lt;ref name='digbris'/&gt; Before he was dismissed by Bishop [[Armitage Robinson]] in 1921, his excavations rediscovered the nature and dimensions of a number of buildings that had occupied the site.&lt;ref name='fortean'/&gt;&lt;ref name='digbris'/&gt; Bond's work at Glastonbury Abbey is one of the first documented examples of [[psychic archaeology]]. Bond with the retired navy Captain John Allan Bartlett ("John Alleyne") as a medium claimed to have contacted through [[automatic writing]] dead monks and the builder of the Edgar Chapel at Glastonbury, who advised him where to excavate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering Glastonbury Abbey - the psychic way|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/somerset/content/articles/2008/06/04/glastonbury_abbey_archeology_feature.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feder 1996"&gt;[[Kenneth Feder|Feder, Kenneth]]. ''Archaeology and the Paranormal''. In [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 32-43. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams 2002"&gt;Williams, William F. (2000). ''[[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience|Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy]]''. Facts on File Inc. p. 39. {{ISBN|1-57958-207-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919 he published ''The Gates of Remembrance'', which revealed that he had employed psychical methods to guide his excavation of the Glastonbury ruins. As a consequence of these revelations his relations with his employers, who strongly disapproved of [[spiritualism]], deteriorated and he was sacked in 1921.&lt;ref name="Williams 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland &amp; Company. p. 11. {{ISBN|978-0-7864-2770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists and [[Skepticism|skeptics]] have found Bond's claims dubious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joe Nickell|Nickell, Joe]]. (2007). ''Adventures in Paranormal Investigation''. University Press of Kentucky. pp. 48-49. {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph McCabe]] suggested that Alleyne and Bond had "steeped themselves, all through the year 1907, in the literature of the subject. They read all that was known about Glastonbury, and lived for months in the medieval atmosphere."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe Joseph]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/isspiritualismba00mccarich#page/141/mode/2up ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined'']. London Watts &amp; Co. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 Rev. H. J. Wilkins published a detailed criticism of Bond's psychical claims. Wilkins concluded "there is absolutely nothing supermundane in the whole of the script... All that is true in the script could be gathered from historical data or reasonably conjectured by intelligent observation of existing facts and conditions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/10th-june-1922/19/false-psychical-claims "False Psychical Claims"]. The Spectator. 9 June, 1922. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologist [[Kenneth Feder]] commented that the "tall church towers, whose existence and locations we are to believe were provided by spirits, actually were recorded and located in a historical document Bond almost surely had already seen. Beyond this, an early drawing of the abbey, and even structural remains visible on the surface, provided clues as to the location of these towers."&lt;ref name="Feder 1996"/&gt;

Feder also noted that "there was no scientific controls whatsoever" and that it is impossible to tell whether he was actually advised by [[spirit]]s or whether his expertise in church architecture and information from early drawings helped him locate the chapels he discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Feder|Feder, Kenneth]]. (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum''. Greenwood. pp. 43-44.  {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fantastic Archaeology"&gt;{{cite book | title=Fantastic Archaeology: the Wild Side of North American Prehistory| last=Williams| first=Stephen| year=1991| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press| location=Philadelphia| isbn=0-8122-1312-2| chapter=Psychic Archaeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychical research==
Bligh joined the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] in 1889, the [[Theosophical Society]] in 1895, the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1902, the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] in 1909&lt;ref&gt;'Will the real Bligh Bond stand up?' by Tim Hopkinson Ball, in ''Avalon Magazine'', No. 37, Autumn/Winter 2007, pp 26-30&lt;/ref&gt; and [[the Ghost Club]] in 1925.

From 1921 to 1926 he was editor of ''Psychic Science'' (then named ''Quarterly transactions of the British College of Psychic Science'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coates|first1=Richard|title=A brief account of the extraordinary life of Frederick Bligh Bond, FRIBA|url=http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/25679/3/FBB4.docx|publisher=University of the West of England|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 Bligh Bond emigrated to the USA, where he was employed as education secretary of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] and worked as editor on their magazine, ''Survival''.&lt;ref name='ans'/&gt; Bligh Bond broke with the ASPR and returned to [[UK|Britain]] in 1936,&lt;ref name='fortean'/&gt; also rejoining the Ghost Club in the process, after supporting accusations against the medium [[Mina Crandon]] that she had fraudulently produced thumbprints on wax that she presented as being produced by the spirit of her dead brother, Walter.&lt;ref name='ans'/&gt;

During his time in the USA Bond was ordained, and in 1933 consecrated as a bishop, in the [[Old Catholic Church]] of America.&lt;ref name='ans'/&gt;

==Later life==
He returned to the United Kingdom in 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Bond arrived in Southampton from New York City on 20 December 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; spending his time in [[London]] and [[Dolgellau]], [[Merionethshire]], where he died of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Monk helped Bristol architect solve abbey mystery...from beyond the grave |url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Monk-helped-Bristol-architect-solve-abbey-mystery/story-23649846-detail/story.html|accessdate=12 November 2015|work=Bristol Post|date=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frederick Bligh Bond|url=http://www.wanhs.org/FrederickBlighBond.html|publisher=Weston-super-Mare Archaeological and Natural History Society|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Bond is mentioned as part of the background to [[Deborah Crombie]]'s mystery novel ''A Finer End'' (Bantam, 2001). {{ISBN|0-553-57927-4}}

On 30 December 2008 Bligh Bond was the subject of a [[Channel 4]] documentary, ''The Ghosts of Glastonbury'', hosted by [[Tony Robinson]], which examined Bligh Bond's claims that he received archaeological information through [[automatic writing]] from deceased monks.

The '''Guisborough Helmet''' is a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[cavalry]] bronze helmet found in 1864 near [[Guisborough]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], England. It was originally fitted with a pair of protective cheek-pieces, which have not survived; the holes by which they were attached can be seen in front of the helmet's ear guards. It is lavishly decorated with incised, punched and embossed figures, indicating that it was probably used for displays or cavalry tournaments, though it may well have been intended to be worn in battle as well. The helmet was found in what appears to have been a carefully arranged deposition in a bed of gravel, distant from any known Roman sites. After it was recovered during road works it was donated to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], where it was restored and is currently on display.&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1363194&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=guisborough&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=2 British Museum collection database]. Accessed 17 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and origins==

Made from [[bronze]] - a [[copper]] alloy - in the 3rd century AD, the [[helmet|helmet's]] brow band is engraved and embossed with representations of shrines ([[aedicula]]e) housing the deities [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and [[Minerva (mythology)|Minerva]], all of whom were associated with war. Prancing horsemen are depicted between the figures. The brow band has three [[diadem]]-like peaks bordered by writhing snakes whose heads meet at the centre, forming an arch above the central figure of Mars. Two bosses stand out at the rear of the helmet, at the centre of embossed flowers. The sides and top of the helmet are embossed with feathers and a feather-like pattern.&lt;ref name="Dixon1"&gt;Dixon, Karen R.; Southern, Pat. ''The Roman cavalry: from the first to the third century AD'', p. 112. Routledge, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-415-17039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, H. Russell. ''The armour of imperial Rome'', p. 102. Scribner, 1975. {{ISBN|978-0-684-13956-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is similar to others found in [[Worthing, Norfolk]] and [[Chalon-sur-Saône]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;A visual comparison of the Chalon and Guisborough Helmets, which are extremely similar, can be found in Jochen Garbsch, ''Römische Paraderüstungen'' (Beck, Munich, 1978), plate 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its relative thinness and lavish decoration, it is thought that such helmets would have been used in battle as well as in parades or ''[[hippika gymnasia]]'' (cavalry tournaments).&lt;ref name="Dixon2"&gt;Dixon, Karen R.; Southern, Pat. ''The late Roman army'', pp. 91-92. Routledge, 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-7134-7047-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet remains something of an enigma. It was buried in a compressed and folded state in complete isolation from any other objects of the same period and at some remove from any known Roman sites; how and why it came to be deposited remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Jenny; Rowe, Peter. ''[http://www.teesarchaeology.com/document_library/documents/roman_booklet.pdf Roman Teesside - Archaeological Booklet No. 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716203048/http://www.teesarchaeology.com/document_library/documents/roman_booklet.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}'', p. 22. Tees Archaeology, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; There is no closely associated fort or fortress in the vicinity. However, the Dutch historian Johan Nicolay has identified a "lifecycle" for Roman military equipment in which ex-soldiers took items home with them as a reminder of their service and occasionally disposed of them away from garrison sites, for instance by votive deposition or burial with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolay, Johan.

Amsterdam University Press - Amsterdam Archaeological Studies, 2008. {{ISBN|978-90-5356-253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Roman cavalry helmet, known as the [[Crosby Garrett Helmet]], was discovered in [[Cumbria]] in May 2010 in a broadly similar context – away from any known settlements but folded before burial – suggesting that it may have been a votive offering or loot that had been hidden for safe-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;Worrell, Sally.

==Discovery and restoration==

[[File:Guisborough helmet findsite.jpg|right|thumb|The Guisborough Helmet was found at this spot during the construction of a road leading under the [[Cleveland Railway (England)|Cleveland Railway]]'s now-demolished line, of which the abutments can still be seen]]
The helmet was discovered on 19 August 1864 at Barnaby Grange Farm, about 2 miles west of Guisborough town centre. It was found buried deep in a bed of gravel during road works carried out for the [[Cleveland Railway (England)|Cleveland Railway Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Elgee, Frank. ''Romans in Cleveland'', p. 13. Hood, 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Christopher Atkinson]] described the circumstances of its discovery in an article for ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' in September 1864:

{{quote|A short time since it was found expedient to supersede the existing accommodation-road to Barnaby Grange Farm, which crosses the Cleveland Railway on the level, by a new one carried beneath the line. While prosecuting the necessary excavation, and after reaching a depth of a few feet, a variety of [animal] bones, most of them in exceedingly good preservation, and with an abundance of earthy phosphate of iron investing them, were dug upon. These were carefully collected, and have now accumulated to a mass of considerable extent ... But the most remarkable of the non-osseus matters was a folded and doubled metal plate, embossed and engraved.&lt;ref name="Atkinson"&gt;Atkinson, J.C. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=BugIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA304 Further Discovery of Relics connected with the Remote Occupants of Cleveland]", pp. 304-308. ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', vol. 217, 1864&lt;/ref&gt;}}

No other artefacts were found at the site and the bones appeared to have no connection with the helmet. They had apparently been deposited naturally by the prehistoric stream that had laid down the gravel bed. Atkinson noted that the artefact was in a strikingly good condition despite its obvious antiquity and the damage done to it:

{{quote|Apart from the folding and doubling to which it has been subjected, it is in remarkably good preservation. It is scarcely corroded in any perceptible degree in any visible part, but is as bright as on the day it was consigned to its place of concealment. Neither is it bruised or dented, except where the workman's pick happened to strike; indeed, it is not even scratched.&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt;}}

[[File:Guisborough helmet Mars.jpg|right|thumb|Detail of the figure of Mars on the front of the helmet]]
He commented that the find appeared to have been "deliberately buried in a hole dug for the purpose, just where it was found; and the unbattered, and even unscratched condition of its entire visible surface seems amply to confirm the inference."&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt; Its crushed condition meant that it was not initially recognisable as a helmet, though its ornamentation was clearly visible. Atkinson described the outer decoration:

{{quote|The chief ornamentation seems to depend on the effigies of two snakes in strong relief and wrought hollow, with their heads meeting ... The bodies of the snakes slightly descending thence, and diverging, seem then to have taken an upward direction so as to enclose or enfold the central portion of the plate. But these details cannot be ascertained so long as the object remains in its present condition. Besides the snakes, on which the scales are represented by regular series of curved lines carefully engraved, several raised boss-like projections, which themselves, as well as the plate around their bases, are rather elaborately chased or engraved, are observable; and the outlines of certain figures, apparently armed in a fashion rather resembling a Greek soldier's defensive equipment, are visible on another part of the surface. Besides these figures and ornaments, other minor ornamental engravings are worked in here and there.&lt;ref name="Atkinson" /&gt;}}

It was at first incorrectly identified as a breastplate of unknown origin (Atkinson thought it to be of "Oriental workmanship") and age. Thomas Richmond, a local historian, erroneously assigned it in 1868 to "a late Celtic, or early Anglo-Saxon period".&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Thomas. ''The local records of Stockton and the neighbourhood'', p. 268. William Robinson, 1868&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Frederick B. Greenwood, who owned the land on which the helmet had been found, presented it to the British Museum. It was restored at the museum by Robert Cooper Ready, resulting in the discovery that it was in fact a Roman helmet.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London''. Volume 7, p. 391. 1876.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently on display in the British Museum's Roman Britain section in Room 49. Similar helmets have been found elsewhere in Europe; the closest continental parallel is a helmet found in the River [[Saône]] at [[Chalon-sur-Saône]] in [[France]] in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Jocelyn M. C. ''Art in Britain under the Romans'', p. 264. Clarendon Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guisborough Helmet represents a distinct form of cavalry helmet, dubbed the "Guisborough type", which can be distinguished by three peaked scallops on the brow band.&lt;ref name="Dixon1" /&gt;

'''Jonathan Charles Douglas Clark''' (born 28 February 1951) is a British historian of both [[History of the British Isles|British]] and [[History of the United States|American history]]. He received his undergraduate degree at [[Downing College, Cambridge]]. Having previously held posts at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] and [[All Souls College, Oxford]] into 1996, he has since held the Joyce C. and Elizabeth Ann Hall Distinguished Professorship of British History at the [[University of Kansas]].

==Achievement==
Clark began as a leading [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] historian of 17th- and 18th century [[History of the British Isles|British history]]. He is notable for arguing against both the [[Marxist historiography|Marxist]] and [[Whig history|Whiggish]] interpretations of the late 17th and 18th centuries. Instead, Clark emphasises the unities and coherences of the [[List of time periods|period]] between 1660 and 1832. It was he who dubbed it the "long eighteenth century," a periodisation which is now widely accepted in historical academia.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''English Society'', p. x, where he also acknowledges that his "programmatic idea" had its "precursor" in [[Betty Kemp]], ''King and Commons 1660–1832'' (London: Macmillan, 1957;1984).&lt;/ref&gt; Clark maintains the period was one of [[Anglican]]-[[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[hegemony]], marked by popular acceptance of the monarchy and the [[Church of England]] as symbols of national unity. This edifice was characterised by the dominance of an aristocratic-[[gentry]] [[oligarchy]] and a sense of national identity (preceding 19th century nationalism), that was firmly underpinned by a shared history and religious allegiance. In Clark's model, Britons embraced the official entrenchment of these parameters, which was challenged primarily by religious dissent.

Clark has also framed an explanation of the [[American Revolution]] as, in part, a "war of religion", triggered by the [[Christian denomination|denomination]]al conflicts still endemic at that time within the English-speaking North Atlantic world.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Language of Liberty'', p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clark has frequently maintained that too often the 18th century has been interpreted teleologically in the light of the 19th; he sees his mission as an historian to explain the long 18th century in its own terms. Clark criticised Marxists such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[E.P. Thompson]] for advancing what he argued was an incorrect interpretation.

In 1994 Clark published ''Samuel Johnson: Literature, Religion, and English Cultural Politics from the Restoration to Romanticism'', in which he argued that Johnson was not only a [[Tory]] but also a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] and a [[nonjuring schism|nonjuror]] (one who declined or avoided loyalty oaths to the Hanoverians). The thesis proved controversial. Clark and the Cambridge-based literary scholar Howard Erskine-Hill debated American literary scholars, chiefly [[Donald Greene]] and Howard Weinbrot, in two successive volumes of ''The Age of Johnson'' (Volumes 7 and 8) and an issue of ''Studies in English Literature.'' Clark and Erskine-Hill produced an edited volume on Johnson's political views in 2002 and two additional volumes on the subject in 2012.

Clark is now primarily interested in the history of religion, and his chief achievement is the reintroduction of a religious dimension into the agendas formerly set by [[positivist]], [[structural functionalism|functionalist]] and [[reductionist]] historians.

'''Jacob Festus Adeniyi Ajayi''', commonly known as '''J. F. Ade Ajayi''', (26 May 1929 – 9 August 2014) was a Nigerian historian and a member of the [[Ibadan school]], a group of scholars interested in introducing African perspectives to [[African history]] and focusing on the internal historical forces that shaped African lives. Ade Ajayi favours the use of historical continuity more often than focusing on events only as powerful agents of change that can move the basic foundations of cultures and mould them into new ones.&lt;ref name="Dibua"&gt;J. I. Dibua The Idol, Its Worshippers, and the Crisis of Relevance of Historical Scholarship in Nigeria, History in Africa, Vol. 24 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead, he sees many critical events in African life, sometimes as weathering episodes which still leave some parts of the core of Africans intact. He also employs a less passionate style in his works, especially in his early writings, using subtle criticism of controversial issues of the times.

==Biography==
Ajayi was born in Ikole-Ekiti on 26 May 1929,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thenationonlineng.net/web2/articles/5563/1/Professor-J-F-Ade-Ajayi-is-80/Page1.html Professor J. F. Ade Ajayi is 80]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; his father was a personal assistant of the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]] of Ikole during the era of Native Authorities. He started education at St Paul's School, Ikole, at the age of five. He then proceeded to Ekiti Central School (now [[Christ's School Ado Ekiti]]) for preparation as a pupil teacher. However, after hearing from a friend about [[Igbobi College]] in [[Lagos]], he decided to try his luck and applied. Thereafter, he gained admission into the college, and equipped with a scholarship from the Ikole Ekiti Native authority, he went to Lagos for secondary education. After completing his studies at Igbobi, he gained admission to the University of Ibadan, where he was to pick between History, Latin or English for his degree. He chose History.&lt;ref name="The News"&gt;A Historian at 75, The News, 10 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he travelled abroad and studied at [[Leicester University]], under the tutelage of Professor [[Jack Simmons (historian)|Jack Simmons]], a brilliant [[Oxford]]-trained historian. In 1956 he married [[Christie Ade Ajayi]] ''née'' Martins.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/10/jf-ade-ajayi JF Ade Ajayi obituary in ''The Guardian'', 10 Sep 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation, he was a research fellow at the Institute of Historical Research, London from 1957–1958. He later returned to Nigeria and joined the history department of the [[University of Ibadan]].

In 1964, he was made Dean of Arts at the University and later promoted a deputy Vice-Chancellor. After his stint as deputy Vice-Chancellor, he was made the Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of Lagos]] in 1972. During his tenure, several buildings were constructed and improvements were made to student accommodation. King Jaja hall was built in 1973 and extensions were made to Queen Amina and Queen Moremi halls respectively.&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.com.ng/quicklinkss/politics/item/15077-ade-ajayi-architect-of-modern-unilag/15077-ade-ajayi-architect-of-modern-unilag|title=Ade Ajayi: Architect of modern UNILAG|publisher=The Nigerian Tribune|author=Tayo Popoola|accessdate=March 2, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008050233/http://tribune.com.ng/quicklinkss/politics/item/15077-ade-ajayi-architect-of-modern-unilag/15077-ade-ajayi-architect-of-modern-unilag|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twilight of his career as Vice-Chancellor was a controversial one, the then [[Obasanjo]] regime had introduced some student fees to the dismay of the students, who demanded free education. Students then decided to riot, a situation which was termed Ali must go. During the protest and riots, a student named Akintunde Ojo was shot by the police. At the time his mother was rumoured to be a mistress of Obasanjo. The ensuing protest by students against the killing led opportunists to seize the situation and cause mayhem. In 1978, he was arbitrarily relieved of his position and returned to Ibadan, where he continued his effort in historical scholarship.

In 1993, Ajayi was awarded the "Distinguished Africanist Award" by the [[African Studies Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.africanstudies.org/p/cm/ld/fid=16 |title="Distinguished Africanist Award 2009" African Studies Association |access-date=12 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728122432/http://www.africanstudies.org/p/cm/ld/fid%3D16 |archive-date=28 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he became an Honorary Fellow of [[SOAS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOAS Honorary Fellows|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/about/fellows/|publisher=SOAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 August 2014, he died at the age of 85 and was buried in his native Ikole Ekiti.&lt;ref name=tribune/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.punchng.com/news/ade-ajayi-former-unilag-vc-dies-at-85-2/ Ade Ajayi, former UNILAG VC, dies at 85] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903120532/http://www.punchng.com/news/ade-ajayi-former-unilag-vc-dies-at-85-2/ |date=3 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==An Early Writer of African history==
As an early writer of Nigerian and African history, though not a pioneer like [[Kenneth Dike]], Ajayi brought considerable respect to the [[Ibadan]] School and African research. He is known for the arduous research and rigorous effort he puts into his work. By extensive use of [[Oral tradition|oral]] sources in some of his works such as pre-twentieth century [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] history, he was able to weigh, balance and assay each and all of his sources, uncovering a pathway towards facts in the period which was scarce in written and non-prejudiced forms.&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;Robert A. Hess, J. F. Ade Ajayi and the New Historiography in West Africa, African Studies Review  &gt; Vol. 14, No. 2, pp 1–4 (Sep. 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Ajayi also tries to be dispassionate in his writings, especially when writing about controversial or passionate subjects in African history. In an article on the history of Yoruba writing, he was able to appraise critically and with resignation, [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], a hero to Ade Ajayi. His style of rigorous research presented new pathways in African historiography and augmented awareness among scholarly circles outside the continent to African methodologies and perceptions. By weighing sources both written and oral, he was able to find new issues of interest that formed the basis of [[British Empire|British]] colonisation of Lagos, balancing official British documentation of the event with additional material.

Another theme in many of his works is nationalism. Ajayi sees religious currents as setting the foundation for modern Nigerian nationalism. The [[Fulani War|Fulani Jihad]] of the early twentieth century set a basis for a common front, while Christian missionaries such as CMS, had laid the foundation for a movement towards unity in the south. The missionaries also established schools that created a new educated class who later broke with the Europeans and fought for a new social and political order. However, the new order embraced European contemporary social, political and economic structures as ideals of the new society.

Ajayi, however, with gradation has expressed a much more critical stance on the need to embrace [[Pan-Africanism]] as the foundation of nationalism.

'''John MacDonald MacKenzie''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRHistS|FRSE}} (born 2 October 1943) is a British historian of [[imperialism]] who pioneered the study of popular and [[cultural imperialism]], as well as aspects of [[environmental history]]. He has also written about Scottish migration and the development of museums around the world. He is Emeritus Professor of imperial history at Lancaster University and founder of the Manchester University Press ‘Studies in Imperialism’ series (1984).

==Biography==

He is the son of Alexander MacKenzie and Hannah (née Whitby) and was schooled in [[Glasgow]] (Scotland) and [[Ndola]] (Zambia), before completing his Ph.D (1969) in [[Vancouver]] (British Columbia) and [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;‘John M MacKenzie’, Debrett’s ''People of Today''&lt;/ref&gt; This cosmopolitan upbringing developed his interest in the history of the [[British Empire]], a subject he has written about in ''Echoes of Empire''&lt;ref&gt;‘Analysing Echoes of Empire in Contemporary Context: the Personal Odyssey of an imperial historian (1970s-present)’, in Kalypso Nikolaidis, Berny Sebe and Gabrielle Maas (eds.), ''Echoes of Empire: Memory, Identity and Colonial Legacies'' (I.B. Tauris, London 2015), pp. 189-206.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''How Empire Shaped Us'',&lt;ref&gt;‘Empire From Above and From Below’ in Antoinette Burton and Dane Kennedy (eds.), ''How Empire Shaped Us'' (Bloomsbury, London 2016), pp. 37-47.
&lt;/ref&gt; and he has travelled extensively throughout its former territories. Among his non-academic posts and responsibilities, he was also chairman of governors of two schools in Morecambe, Lancashire, and was a magistrate of the Lancaster petty sessions (1990-2000). He retired from Lancaster University in 2002 and now lives in Perthshire, Scotland.

==Academic career==

At the beginning of his career he taught at the University of British Columbia, and subsequently at the University of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), the University of Liverpool, and  Wilfrid Laurier University, Ontario. His principal post from 1968 was at the [[University of Lancaster]], where he held the chair of imperial history from 1991 to 2002. He was also successively Principal of the County College, Dean of Arts and Humanities and Dean of Education. He holds (or has held) honorary professorships of the Universities of [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]] and [[University of Stirling|Stirling]], and is an [[Honorary fellow|honorary professorial fellow]] of the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 2016 he became Visiting Professor at the University of the Highlands and Islands. He is a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].

His early work, the subject of his Ph.D, was on labour migration and pre-colonial technology and trade in Central Africa. He conducted oral research throughout Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1973-74 and this gave him a keen awareness of the traditional relationships between African communities and their environments. He was also influenced by his experiences as an archaeologist both in Scotland and in Africa, which served to emphasise his belief that historical evidence is to be found in sources other than documents.  This helped lead to his pioneering development of the study of the popular culture of imperialism in his books ''Propaganda and Empire'' (1984) and (edited) ''Imperialism and Popular Culture'' (1986), in which he argued that empire had just as significant effects upon the dominant as upon the subordinate societies. He used a wide range of materials from cultural sources, including ephemera. This proved to be controversial since some elements of the historical Establishment considered that British domestic history was somehow little connected with its empire. 

In the  [[Porter–MacKenzie debate]] his ideas were challenged by Bernard Porter in the latter’s ''The Absent-Minded Imperialists'',&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Porter, ''The Absent-Minded Imperialists. Empire, Society and Culture in Britain'' (Oxford U.P. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; although Porter never actually confronted MacKenzie's evidence head-on. However, MacKenzie’s followers have mounted a vigorous fight-back, not least in the many books (well over 100) in the [[Manchester University Press]] ‘Studies in Imperialism’ series which he edited between 1984 and 2014.

His next book, ''The Empire of Nature'' (1988)'','' was an early contribution to the environmental history of empire, particularly charting the human relationship with animals, through both hunting and conservation, in the imperial take-over of Africa and India. His wider ideas on environmental history were set out in the Thomas Callander Memorial Lectures at the University of Aberdeen in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Later published as: ''Empires of Nature and the Nature of Empires : Imperialism, Scotland and the Environment,'' the Callander Lectures 1995, University of Aberdeen (Tuckwell, East Linton 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to open up a major field to which many other scholars have contributed.

He once again entered the realm of controversy with his critique of Edward Said's ''Orientalism'',&lt;ref&gt;Edward Said, ''Orientalism'' (New York, Pantheon, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1995, which was badly received by post-Saidians and post-colonialists, although many of his early publications pioneered their later work. Said's strict binarism and concentration on concepts of the 'other' were countered by MacKenzie's insistence that Orientalism could, in certain circumstances, involve constructive cross-cultural influences, notably in the arts. These notions were later accepted and developed by other scholars.  His interest in the visual arts was reflected in his chapter the subject in the ''Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire'' (1996)&lt;ref&gt;'Art and the Empire' in P.J. Marshall (ed.), ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire'' (Cambridge U.P. 1996), pp.296-316.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in ''Exhibiting the Empire'' (2015)''.''

His 1991 professorial inaugural lecture ‘Scotland and the British Empire’&lt;ref&gt;Later published as: ‘Essay and Reflection: on Scotland and the Empire’, in ''The International History Review'' (Simon Fraser University), Vol.XV, No.4, Nov. 1993, pp.714-739.&lt;/ref&gt; was well received and opened up new fields for him, including various aspects of work on the Scottish Diaspora.  This led to his book ''The Scots in South Africa'' (with Nigel R. Dalziel) of 2007 (while associated with to the Research Institute of Irish and Scottish Studies at Aberdeen University) and a number of edited works. These analysed notions of sub-British ethnicity and identity, not least in their associational, religious and cultural manifestations. He then developed the concept of the four nations and empire, extending the arguments of J.G.A. Pocock to the British Empire, suggesting that it was not so much ‘British’ as a combination of Irish, Scottish, Welsh and English empires, reflecting a range of ethnic skill sets,  cultures and identities which in turn influenced British domestic history.

His lifelong interest in museums produced ''Museums and Empire'' (2009), a work resulting from a Leverhulme Trust Emeritus Fellowship which examined the dispersal of the idea of the museum in Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, India and elsewhere. This embedded the development of these institutions within the colonial bourgeois public spheres while reflecting contemporary interests in natural history and ethnography which in turn served to develop the individual identities of various colonies. In recent years he has become particularly interested in comparative empires and the manner in which such parallel studies can illuminate the history of the British Empire.

Andrew S. Thompson’s edited book ''Writing Imperial Histories''&lt;ref&gt;Andrew S. Thompson (ed.), ''Writing Imperial Histories'' (Manchester University Press 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2013 celebrating the significance and influence of his ‘Studies in Imperialism’ series. The same year Karl S. Hele’s edited ''The Nature of Empires and the Empires of Nature'',&lt;ref&gt;Karl S. Hele (ed.), ''The Nature of Empires and the Empires of Nature. Indigenous Peoples and the Great Lakes Environment'' (Wilfred Laurier University Press 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; consciously echoing the title of his own earlier book of 1997, examined his environmental work while greatly extending it, notably in Canada.

He has also been an editor of major reference works, including ''Peoples, Nations and Cultures'' (2005) and the four-volume ''Encyclopaedia of Empire'' (2016), and has contributed many articles and reviews to journals as well as chapters in books. He was editor of the journal ''Environment and History,'' 2000-2005 and is editor-in-chief of ''Britain and the World, the Journal of the British Scholar Society.''

He has given BBC Radio talks, has appeared on television programmes relating to the British Empire, and has written for The Scotsman and other newspapers. He was historical adviser for exhibitions at the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the Royal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh (both on David Livingstone, 1997) and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London ('Inventing New Britain: The Victorian Vision', 2001).

It includes both hoards that were buried with the intention of retrieval at a later date (personal hoards, [[Foundry|founder's]] hoards, merchant's hoards, and hoards of loot), and also hoards of [[votive offering]]s which were not intended to be recovered at a later date, but excludes [[grave goods]] and single items found in isolation.  Hoards of Celtic coins dating from the time of the Roman occupation of Britain are also included here.

The '''long 18th century''' is a phrase used by many British historians to cover a more ''natural'' historical period than the simple use of the standard calendar definition. They expand the century to include larger British historical movements, with their subsequent "long" 18th century typically running from the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 to the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Olsen |first1=John Andreas |first2=Colin S. |last2=Gray | title=The Practice of Strategy: From Alexander the Great to the Present |publisher=Oxford University Press| year=2011 | isbn=9780199608638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baines&gt;{{cite book | last = Baines | first = Paul | title = The Long 18th century | publisher=Arnold | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-340-81372-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions, perhaps those with a more social or global interest, extend the period further to, for example, 1660–1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=O'Gorman, Frank | title=The Long Eighteenth Century: British Political and Social History 1688–1832 (The Arnold History of Britain Series) |publisher=Hodder Arnold| year=1997 | isbn=978-0-340-56751-7 | oclc=243883533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baines&gt;{{cite book | last = Baines | first = Paul | title = The Long 18th century | publisher=Arnold | location = London | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-340-81372-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Marshall |first=P.

'''Manuel María Uribe Angel''' (4 September 1822 – 16 June 1904) was a Colombian physician, geographer and politician, he has been called the "''father of medicine of Antioquia''" for his contributions to the advances of the practice of [[medicine in Colombia]] and the [[Antioquia Department]]. He was also known outside the realm of medicine for his studies and works on the [[geography of Colombia|geography]] and [[history of Colombia]]. He also served as President of the then [[Sovereign State of Antioquia]] and as [[Senator of Colombia]].

==Life==
Manuel María Uribe Angél&lt;ref name="academia"&gt;{{cite book |title= Un siglo de gobierno en Antioquia|year=1990 |publisher= Academia Antioqueña de Historia |location= Medellín |oclc= 25004846 |page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="varones"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mejía Montoya |first1=Alfonso |authorlink1= |last2=Piedrahita Echeverri |first2=Javier |first3=Humberto |last3=Bronx|title=Varones ilustres de Antioquia |year=1979 |publisher=Academia Antioqueña de Historia |location=Medellín |language=Spanish|oclc=6815674 |page=327 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born on 4 September 1822 in ''la Magnolia'',&lt;ref name="mua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mua.edu.co/mua/content/view/19/32/ |title=Historia de la Institución |accessdate=29 May 2009 |language=Spanish |publisher=Institución Educativa Manuel Uribe Ángel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120125850/http://mua.edu.co/mua/content/view/19/32/ |archivedate=20 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hacienda]] of his parents José María Uribe Arango and María Josefa Ángel Uribe,&lt;ref name="varones"/&gt; both from an educated and well to do family in the town of [[Envigado]], in what was then the Province of Antioquia, now [[Antioquia Department]], during the First Republic or [[Gran Colombia]]. As customary in those times, he was baptized the following day in the [[parish church]] of [[Gertrude the Great|Saint Gertrude]] in Envigado by Felipe de Restrepo.&lt;ref name="academia"/&gt; And years later [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmed in the Roman Catholic faith]] by the 1st Bishop Antioquia Mariano Garnica y Dorjuela.&lt;ref name="lea"/&gt;

===Education===
His education began in his home town and first taught by Alejo Escobar, and during his youth worked as secretary of the doctor Nicolás de Villa Tirado; the lack of proper education in Antioquia given the fresh independence of the nation, forced Uribe to depart to the capital of the country, [[Bogotá]] where he began his studies on 18 October 1836 at the [[Our Lady of the Rosary University|High College of Our Lady of the Rosary]], where he was a student of both his brother Wenceslao, and his uncle Pedro Uribe Arango who were professors at the institution. After graduating from Our Lady of the Rosary, he moved on to study Medicine at the [[Central University (Colombia)|Central University of the Republic]], from where he graduated in 1844 as [[Doctor of Medicine|Doctor in Medicine]] and [[surgeon|Surgery]].&lt;ref name="boletin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Academia Nacional de Historia|editor1-first=Pedro M.|editor1-last=Ibañez|title=Boletín de historia y antigüedades |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZqzNAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 May 2009 |year=1904|publisher=Imprenta Nacional |location=Bogotá|language=Spanish |issn=0006-6303 |oclc=1606508|pages=271–280 |volume=II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating he moved for a short time back to Antiquia, but soon began a life of travelling, living in [[Quito]], [[Ecuador]] where he received an honorary degree in Medicine from the [[Central University of Ecuador]], from then to [[Peru]], the United States, and finally to Paris, France, where he lived for two years specializing his medical training.&lt;ref name="boletin"/&gt;
Upon his return to Antioquia he married Magdalena Urreta Saldarriaga in 1854, and remained in the country for a good time, practicing medicine, now a renowned man in his field.

Manuel Uribe Ángel developed a renowned fame not only as a doctor, but as a versatile and all-around intellectual socialite. In 1871, after the creation of the Department of Medicine of the [[University of Antioquia]], he joined the institution as a faculty professor of medicine, French, [[Gross anatomy|Gross Human Anatomy]], [[Physics]], [[Residency (medicine)|Residency]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carrasquilla |first1=Tomás |authorlink1=Tomás Carrasquilla |last2=Bernal Villegas |first2=Leticia |editor1-first=Leticia |editor1-last=Bernal Villegas|others=Ministerio de Cultura : Gobernación de Antioquia |title=Obra escogida |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mtKvSVE_pqMC |accessdate=29 May 2009 |edition=1st |series= |year=2008|publisher=Editorial Universidad de Antioquia |location=Medellín |language=Spanish |isbn=978-958-714-124-5 |oclc=248399354|page=297|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a founder member, 1st and 3rd President of the Academy of Medicine of Medellín,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Botero Restrepo |first1=Juan |title=La Academia de Medicina de Medellín, fundadores y presidentes|year=1988 |location=Medellín |language=Spanish|oclc=23770427|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during the first National Congress of Medicine of Colombia was designated honorary president of the congregation.

===Politics===
In 1875, he traveled again to the United States, this tine not only as a mere tourist but as representative of his Government to the United States for the occasion of the Centenary of the death of [[Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]].&lt;ref name="udea"/&gt; On this occasion he also travelled to [[Mexico]], and the [[Antilles]], but on his return to the country due to the events of the [[Colombian Civil War of 1876]], and the similar wars from then on, he began to venture in to the realm of politics as a member of the [[Colombian Liberal Party]].

In 1877, Uribe participated as [[Deputy (legislator)|Deputy]] of Antioquia during the [[constituent assembly]], becoming its President, and on 10 April 1877 Uribe was elected President of the [[Sovereign State of Antioquia]],&lt;ref name="lea"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Osorio Lozano |first1=Nelson |last2=Jaramillo Alzate |first2=José |editor1-first=José María |editor1-last=Bravo Betancur |others=Gobernacion de Antioquia, Academia Antioqueña de Historia, Asociación de Exgobernadores y Exdiputados de Antioquia|title=Gobernantes de Antioquia|url=http://www.lea.org.co/Uploads/documentosCompletos/GOBERNANTES%20DE%20ANTIOQUIA.pdf |accessdate=30 May 2009|date=December 2007|publisher=La Enciclopedia de Antioquia |location=Medellín |language=Spanish|pages=389–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[State (administrative division)|state]] in the [[United States of Colombia]]. His administration was challenged by the growing tensions between Liberals and [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservatives]], Antioquia being a Conservative state was under attack by the Liberal Federal government and under the Military lead of [[Julián Trujillo Largacha]], who succeeded Uribe on 31 October 1877&lt;ref name="lea"/&gt; in power after crushing of Conservative forces.

Uribe Ángel was sent to the [[Sovereign State of Panama]] to Represent Antioquia at the [[groundbreaking]] ceremony for the [[Panama Canal]] on 1 January 1880.&lt;ref name="boletin"/&gt;

In 1882, as a member of the Liberal party, Uribe Ángel was elected [[Senator of Colombia]].&lt;ref name="lea"/&gt;

'''Martín Alonso Pinzón''', ({{IPA-es|maɾˈtin aˈlonso pinˈθon}}; [[Palos de la Frontera]], [[Huelva]]; c. 1441 – c. 1493)&lt;ref name="Catholic - death" /&gt; was a [[Spain|Spanish]] mariner, shipbuilder, navigator and [[exploration|explorer]], oldest of the [[Pinzón brothers]]. He sailed with [[Christopher Columbus]] on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|first voyage]] to the [[New World]] in 1492, as [[captain (nautical)#Master|captain]] of the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Martín Alonso Pinzón}}&lt;/ref&gt; His youngest brother [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]] was captain of the ''[[Niña]]'', and the middle brother [[Francisco Martín Pinzón]] was ''maestre'' (first mate) of the ''Pinta''.

==The Pinzón family of Palos==
{{Main|Pinzón brothers#The Pinzón family of Palos}}
The Pinzón family was among the leading families of Palos de la Frontera in the late 15th century. There are several conflicting theories about the origin of the family and of their name (''see [[Pinzón brothers#The Pinzón family of Palos|Pinzón family]]''). His grandfather was as sailor and diver known as ''Martín''; it is not clear whether that was a first or last name, and whether in his generation ''Pinzón'' was a surname or an [[epithet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|Tomo III, p. 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "juliobreve"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://es.geocities.com/julioil/breve.htm|title = Breve historia de Palos de la Frontera|accessdate = 2008-10-03|author = Izquierdo Labrado, Julio|authorlink = Julio Izquierdo Labrado|year = 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227025859/http://es.geocities.com/julioil/breve.htm|archivedate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a sailor named Martín Pinzón; his mother was named Mayor Vicente.&lt;ref name=parents /&gt;

==Life==
Born in Palos around 1441, it appears that at quite a young age Pinzón shipped out on a locally based [[caravel]] as a ''grumete'' (cabin boy). His home, now the [[Casa Museo de Martín Alonso Pinzón]], was on the old royal road to the [[Monastery of La Rábida]].&lt;ref name="Duro1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="casapinzon"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/cultura/iaph/bdi/resumen.do?id=i247536|title= Casa de Martín Alonso Pinzón|author= Instituto Andaluz del Patrimonio Histórico, [http://www.juntadeandalucia.es Junta de Andalucía]|accessdate= 2008-10-26}}

Leonor, the youngest, suffered frequent attacks of what was then called "''gota coral''" and would now be called [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref name = "JulioPinzón" /&gt;

A French tradition holds that Alonso Pinzón sailed to the New World with the navigator [[Jean Cousin (navigator)|Jean Cousin]], and that together they discovered the continent in 1488, four years before Colombus.&lt;ref name="Shipley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wintroub"/&gt; Back in [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], Pinzón left Cousin in a dispute, and is claimed to have left for Spain, from where he advised Columbus on his westward sail.&lt;ref name="Shipley"&gt;''The English Rediscovery and Colonization of America'' by Marie A. Shipley p.5  [https://books.google.com/books?id=POKossFY9JEC&amp;pg=PA3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wintroub"&gt;''A savage mirror: power, identity, and knowledge in early modern France'' Michael Wintroub p.21 [https://books.google.com/books?id=MBEjEjq7pmoC&amp;pg=PA21]&lt;/ref&gt; Pinzon is known to have displayed a remarkable confidence in guiding Columbus in his discovery of the New World.&lt;ref name="Shipley"/&gt; No indisputable written records remain, however, to support this early claim to discovery.&lt;ref name="Wintroub"/&gt;

His nautical experience and his leadership remained patent in the 1508–1536 lawsuits known as the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'' ("Columbian lawsuits"), where the witnesses indicated him as the leader of the ''[[comarca]]'' (a region comparable to a [[shire]]). He was also famous for his battles against [[Kingdom of Portugal|the Portuguese]] in the [[War of the Castilian Succession]].&lt;ref&gt;Relevant passages from the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'' are cited in {{Harvnb|Ortega|1980|loc=Tomo III, p. 47}} and quoted in the notes for the article [[Pinzón brothers]]. One witness said of him "neither on sea nor land the King had no other man so valiant nor brave as him".&lt;/ref&gt; It is probable that even while in Portugal before coming to Spain, Columbus was aware of Martín Alonso, because he was known for his participation in the war, as well as for his incursions into the Afro-Atlantic waters in the wake of the Portuguese, traveling to the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]], with their rich fisheries and the commercial possibility of trade in gold, spices, and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pulido Robio, José|year=1952|title=Algunas consideraciones sobre unos documentos referentes a Palos, inmediatos al descubrimiento|publisher=Anuario de Estudios Americanos.|volume= IX|pages=Art. 2, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations for the voyage of discovery==
On 23 May 1492 a royal provision was read out to the residents of Palos,&lt;ref name="realprovision"&gt;[http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/documentos/conquista_y_colonia/real_provision_reyes_catolicos.phpReal Provisión de los [[Reyes Católicos]] que mandaron a Diego Rodríguez Prieto y a otros compañeros, vecinos de la villa de Palos, para que tuvieran preparadas dos carabelas al servicio de Cristóbal Colón.

The sailors of Palos had no confidence in embarking on this adventure with Columbus, who was largely unknown to them. Independent of their greater or lesser credence in his ideas, the men of Palos found it difficult to support the [[Genoa|Genovese]] sailor if he was not accompanied by a mariner known and respected in the town. The venture—risky and, above all, of uncertain profit—did not present great attractions. Opposition or indifference to Columbus's project was general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Ibarra y Rodríguez, Eduardo|title = Don Fernando el Católico y el descubrimiento de América|url= https://archive.org/stream/dfernandoel00lbarrich#page/n7/mode/2up|publisher = Imprenta de Fortaner, Madrid| year = 1892| pages= [https://archive.org/stream/dfernandoel00lbarrich#page/180/mode/2up 180–184]}} The link is to archive.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no record of any written agreement between Columbus and Pinzón, and the terms of any agreement are lost to history. However, we do have the writings of Fray [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] and the testimony of some witnesses. According to Fernández Duro, de las Casas says Columbus offered Pinzón equal honors in the voyage and half the profits, and Diego Pinzón Colmenero testified the same in the ''pleitos colombinos''; Francisco Medel testified that he heard him offer Pinzón "whatever he asked for and desired".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/53/mode/2up p. 53-54]}}. The original of the quoted phrase is ''"quanto pidiese y quisiese"'' heard his say he would treat him like a brother&lt;/ref&gt;

As a strong sign of his commitment to Columbus's plan, Pinzón put up half a million (''"medio cuento"'') [[Spanish maravedí|maravedís]] in coin toward the cost of the voyage, half of the amount that had been put up by the monarchy.&lt;ref name = "LascasasPinzón" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "asensiopinzón"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asensio|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/martbinalonsopi00asenrich#page/66/mode/2up p. 66–68.]}}

===The voyage out===
On 3 August 1492, the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'', and ''[[Niña]]'' left Palos on their voyage of discovery. Admiral Columbus captained the flagship ''Santa María'', Pinzón was captain of the ''Pinta''; his middle brother Francisco was master. It was from the ''Pinta'' that [[Rodrigo de Triana]] would be the first to sight land in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:wikisource:es:Diario de a bordo del primer viaje de Cristóbal Colón: texto completo|Diario de a bordo del primer viaje de Cristóbal Colón: texto completo]] (complete text of the Ship's diary of Columbus's first voyage, as assembled by Fray [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]. Hereafter, "''Ship's Diary''") 11 October [1492] "And because the caravela Pinta had more sail and went ahead of the Admiral, it found land and made the sign the Admiral had ordered. This land was seen first by a sailor named Rodrigo de Triana." ''"Y porque la carabela Pinta era más velera e iba delante del Almirante, halló tierra e hizo las señas que el Almirante había mandado. Esta tierra fue vista primero por un marinero que se decía Rodrigo de Triana"''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the voyage, Pinzón demonstrated on several occasions his gifts as an expert mariner and as a leader. When the tiller of the ''Pinta'' broke ''en route'' to the Canary Islands, Columbus, who could not get close enough to help from the ''Santa María'':
{{quote|...was a bit less worried knowing that Martín Alonso Pinzón was a vigorous and ingenious person.  ...he resolved the problem of the broken tiller of the Pinta and was able to continue sailing.&lt;ref&gt;''Ship's Diary'', 6 August [1492]&lt;br /&gt;
{{quote|''Lunes, 6 de agosto&lt;br /&gt;...Viose allí el Almirante en gran turbación por no poder ayudar a la dicha carabela sin su peligro, y dice que alguna pena perdía con saber que Martín Alonso Pinzón era persona esforzada y de buen ingenio. En fin, anduvieron entre día y noche veintinueve leguas. Durante la travesía, demostró sus habilidades de marinero cuando resolvió el problema de la rotura del timón de La Pinta y pudo seguir navegando.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} When, between 6 and 7 October 1492 Columbus was unable to reestablish discipline among the tired and discouraged crew of the ''Santa María'', Martín Alonso with his gift of command managed to resolve the situation. As the Hernán Pérez Mateos would testify over forty years later:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;as they did not discover land, those who went with the said Columbus wanted to mutiny and rise against him, saying they were lost, and then the said Columbus had said to Martín Alonso what was going on among these people, and what it seemed to him they ought to do; and that the said Martín Alonso Pinzón had responded to him; «Sir; hang half a dozen of them and throw them into the sea, and if you dare not, I and my brothers will get up close to them and do it, that an armada that left with the mandate of such high princes not have to return without good news.» And that he knew that with that they would regain their spirits; and the said Columbus had said; «Martin Alonso; lets make things good with these gentlemen and travel another eight days, and if in that time we don't find land, we will give another order on what we ought to do.» ...&lt;ref&gt;Testimony in the ''pleitos colombinos'' by Hernán Pérez Mateos, former pilot of Palos, age 80, given in [[Santo Domingo]] 26 January 1536. [[Archivo General de Indias]]. Sección: Patronato. Signatura: PATRONATO,12,N.2,R.14.{{quote|''...&amp;nbsp;como no descubrían tierra, los que venían con el dicho Colón se querían amotinar y alzar contra el, diciendo que iban perdidos, y entonces el dicho Colón había dicho a Martín Alonso lo que pasaba con aquella gente, y que qué le parescía que debían hacer; e que el dicho Martín Alonso Pinzón le había respondido; «Señor; ahorque vuesa merced a media docena dellos e échelos al mar, y si no se atreve, yo e mis hermanos barloaremos sobre ellos y lo haremos, que armada que salio con mandato de tan altos principes no ha de volver atras sin buenas nuevas.» Y que sabe que con esto se animaron; y el dicho Colón había dicho; «Martin Alonso; con estos hidalgos hayamonos bien y andemos otros ocho días, e si en estos no hayamos tierra, daremos otra orden en lo que debemos hacer.» ...''}}

Then went forty leagues between day and night; he told the people thirty-three leagues. That night Martín Alonso said it would be set course southwest by west; and to the Admiral it seemed that this Martín Alonso said this because of the island of [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipango]] (Japan), and the Admiral saw that if they missed it they could not soon find land quickly and that it would be better off to go first to the mainland and later to the islands.}}{{quote|''Sábado, 6 de octubre.&lt;br /&gt;Navegó su camino al Oeste o Güeste, que es lo mismo. Anduvieron cuarenta leguas entre día y noche; contó a la gente treinta y tres leguas. Esta noche dijo Martín Alonso que sería bien navegar a la cuarta del Oeste, a la parte del Sudoeste; y al Almirante pareció que no decía esto Martín Alonso por la isla de Cipango, y el Almirante veía que si la erraban que no pudieran tan presto tomar tierra y que era mejor una vez ir a la tierra firme y después a las islas.''|[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01383853166915529202802/ima0046.htm ''Diario de la primera navegación.''] Narrative assembled by Bartolomé de las Casas.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change brought the expedition to landfall on [[Guanahani]] on 12 October 1492.

These and other acts by Pinzón and by his brothers, especially Vicente, have led historians to see the brothers as "co-discoverers of America",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Manzano y Manzano|1988|loc=Vol. III. p. 5}}, {{Harvnb|Arranz Márquez|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=YerxcpDT_vsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA208,M1 p. 208]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that without their help, support, and courage, Columbus probably could not have achieved his enterprise of discovery, at least not in that time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gould|1984|loc=[https://books.google.es/books?id=3YktZjeEVnYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA93,M1 p. 93]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/45/mode/2up p. 45-47.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José María Asensio quoted in {{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/125/mode/2up p. 125]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point during the ''pleitos colombinos'', a royal prosecutor argued that Pinzón had played a more important role in the discovery of the Indies the Columbus himself.&lt;ref name="Villapolos Salas 300"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Villapolos Salas|first=Gustavo|title=La naturaleza procesal de los Pleitos Colombinos|journal=Anuario Jurídico|volume=III-IV|year=1976–1977|publisher=Biblioteca Jurídica Virtual|url=http://www.bibliojuridica.org/libros/5/2119/13.pdf|accessdate=2009-08-14|page=300 (p. 16 of PDF)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728033610/http://www.bibliojuridica.org/libros/5/2119/13.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation in the Caribbean===
All evidence—the remarks in Columbus's diary, the testimony in the ''pleitos colombinos''—is that on the outward voyage, relations between Columbus and Pinzón remained positive. Once among the Caribbean islands, that began to change.

On 21 November 1492, off the coast of [[Cuba]], Pinzón failed to follow a direct order of Columbus to change course.&lt;ref&gt;José María Asensio quoted in {{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/67/mode/2up p. 67 ''et. seq.'']}}&lt;/ref&gt; He probably sailed off on his own trying to make individual discoveries and to find treasure,&lt;ref name=Catholic /&gt; although Cesáreo Fernández Duro argues that the initial separation may have been accidental, a matter of missed signals. (Asensio takes Fernández Duro strongly to task for not adequately explaining the length of the separation;&lt;ref&gt;José María Asensio quoted in {{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/73/mode/2up p. 73 ''et. seq.'']}} In this passage, Fernández Duro is quoting Asenio quoting Fernández Duro himself.&lt;/ref&gt; Fernández Duro responds that Pinzón simply continued the prior course, and if Columbus wanted, he should have had a pretty fair idea where to find him over the next several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892}}, especially [https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/91/mode/2up p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt;) During his separate travels he discovered new land; while all of the island geography of the first voyage is open to question,&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, John W. (1941) The Ocean Navigation of Columbus on His First Voyage. The [[American Neptune]], I 209-240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Douglas T.

19th-century historian José María Asensio, at least, blamed Pinzón's absence for the fact that on 25 December, the ''Santa María'' was wrecked on a shoal;&lt;ref&gt;José María Asensio quoted in {{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/72/mode/2up p. 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinzón's brother Vicente in command of the ''Niña'' played a key part in rescuing the sailors and Columbus himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Ship's Diary'', 25 December [1492].&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus, giving up on Pinzón, began sailing homeward 4 January, leaving behind 38 men,&lt;ref&gt;''Ship's Diary'', 2 January [1493], 4 January [1493].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stone&gt;Edward T.

Columbus's published diary of the voyage was heavily edited by Bartolomé de las Casas, so it is impossible to know what was actually written at the time and what was added later,&lt;ref&gt;[http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/colonial/columbus_ch.html Christopher Columbus (1451-1506)], Textbook Site for ''The Heath Anthology of American Literature'', Fifth Edition, Paul Lauter, General Editor, college.cengage.com, accessed online 2010-01-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The matter is taken up at length in Estelle Irizarry, "The two authors of Columbus' ''Diary'', ''Computers and the Humanities'', Springer Netherlands, ISSN 0010-4817 (Print), Volume 27, Number 2 / March, 1993 ISSN 1572-8412 (Online), DOI 10.1007/BF01830301. The free online [http://www.springerlink.com/content/q5263271g5650251/ SpringerLink page] gives an abstract and a free excerpt, but there is no free online access to the paper itself.&lt;/ref&gt; but the diary launches a series of accusations against Pinzón beginning with his separation on November 21:
{{quote|Wednesday, 21 November [1492]&lt;br /&gt;...This day Martín Alonso Pinzón departed with the caravel Pinta, without the obedience and will of the Admiral, out of greed, he says that an Indian that the Admiral had ordered to be put in that caravel had told him where to get much gold [the Spanish here, ''le había de dar mucho oro'', is a bit obscure, but this seems to be the sense], and so he went away without waiting, without cause of bad weather, just because he wanted to. And here the Admiral says: «He did and said many other [things] to me».&lt;ref&gt;''Ship's Diary'':{{quote|''Miércoles, 21 de noviembre&lt;br /&gt;... Este día se apartó Martín Alonso Pinzón con la carabela Pinta, sin obediencia y voluntad del Almirante, por codicia, dice que pensando que un indio que el Almirante había mandado poner en aquella carabela le había de dar mucho oro, y así se fue sin esperar, sin causa de mal tiempo, sino porque quiso. Y dice aquí el Almirante: «otras muchas me tiene hecho y dicho».''}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Tuesday, 8 January [1493]&lt;br /&gt;With such strong winds from the east and southeast he did not leave that day, because of which he ordered that that caravel be supplied with water and firewood and all that was necessary for the entire voyage, because although he intended to travel by ship along that whole [[Hispaniola]] coast as far as he could, but, because those he put in the caravels for commanders were brothers, to wit Martín Alonso Pinzón and Vicente Yáñez, and others who followed him with arrogance and greed estimating that everything was already theirs, not looking at the honor the Admiral had given them, they had not obeyed and did not obey his commands, before they had said and done many unmerited things against him, and this Martín Alonso left him from 21 November until 6 January without any cause or reason except disobedience, all of which the Admiral had suffered and been silent to bring a good end to his voyage, so that, to leave behind such bad company, with whom he says that it was necessary to dissimulate, although they were lawless people, and though he had to say while with them that they were good men*, because it was not the time to speak of punishment, he agreed to return and stop no more, as quickly as was possible ...&lt;ref&gt;''Ship's Diary'':{{quote|''Martes, 8 de enero&lt;br /&gt;
Por el viento Este y Sudeste mucho que ventaba no partió este día, por lo cual mandó que se guarneciese la carabela de agua y leña y de todo lo necesario para todo el viaje, porque, aunque tenía voluntad de costear toda la costa de aquella Española que andando el camino pudiese, pero, porque los que puso en las carabelas por capitanes eran hermanos, conviene a saber Martín Alonso Pinzón y Vicente Yáñez, y otros que le seguían con soberbia y codicia estimando que todo era ya suyo, no mirando la honra que el Almirante les había hecho y dado, no habían obedecido ni obedecían sus mandamientos, antes hacían y decían muchas cosas no debidas contra él, y el Martín Alonso lo dejó desde el 21 de noviembre hasta el 6 de enero sin causa alguna ni razón sino por su desobediencia, todo lo cual el Almirante había sufrido y callado por dar buen fin a su viaje, así que, por salir de tan mala compañía, con los cuales dice que cumplía disimular, aunque eran gente desmandada, y aunque tenía dice que consigo muchos hombres de bien, pero no era tiempo de entender en castigo, acordó volverse y no parar más, con la mayor prisa que le fue posible ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
:&amp;nbsp;* &lt;small&gt;An effort to make sense of a rather obscure phrase, ''"y aunque tenía dice que consigo muchos hombres de bien"''; possibly alternatively "and though he had to say that they had many good men with them".&lt;/small&gt;

Nonetheless, much of the testimony in the ''pleitos colombinos'', as well as part of the specialized historiography&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/66/mode/2up p. 66-108.]}}

===Return voyage and death===
During the voyage back to Spain, Pinzón's ship was separated from Columbus in stormy conditions, southwest of the [[Azores]].&lt;ref name=Stone /&gt; Pinzón arrived in [[Baiona, Pontevedra|Baiona]] in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], near [[Vigo]], 1 March 1493;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diphuelva.es/inicial.aspx#aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaXBodWVsdmEuZXMvd2ViL2NvbnRlbmlkb19iYXNpY28uYXNweD9pZENvbnRlbmlkbz0yOTEmaWRBcmVhPTExMQ Las naves] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810101911/http://www.diphuelva.es/inicial.aspx |date=2009-08-10 }}, on the site of the [[Wharf of the Caravels]], Diputación Provincial de Huelva. Accessed online 2010-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus reached [[Lisbon]] on March 4; he later faced problems with the Court for having touched down in Portugal out of necessity in bad weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/113/mode/2up p. 113.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinzón, despite the bad weather and strong southerly winds, had managed to touch down on Spanish territory, not Portuguese. Believing Columbus to be lost, he sent a letter to the King and Queen; some have argued that he claimed the glory of the great discoveries for himself, while others defend him from the charge; the letter itself is lost. It is not clear whether his letter or Columbus's from Lisbon reached court first, nor is it clear whether the failure to invite Pinzón to court resulted from Columbus's primacy of position, possible accusations by Columbus against Pinzón, or simply reports of Pinzón's illness and death.&lt;ref name=Duro-117&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/117/mode/2up p. 117 ''et. seq.'']}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinzón returned home to Palos, arriving on 15 March 1493, precisely the same day the ''Niña'' reached the voyage's starting point.  Exhausted and suffering from a recurrent fever,&lt;ref name = "JulioPinzón"/&gt; he was taken from his ship in a stretcher. As Columbus arrived, his friends took him to a farm on the boundary between Palos and Moguer. It is possible that Martín's son, Arias Pérez Pinzón, did not bring him directly to his house in Palos in order to protect him, given that Columbus had threatened him earlier. Another possibility is that this was because Martín did not get along well with Catalina Alonso,&lt;ref&gt;Archivo General de Simancas, Registro General del Sello, 12 de octubre de 1493.

Accessed online 2010-01-12.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the testimony of Francisco Medel and Hernán Pérez Mateos, he was brought to the La Rábida Monastery, where he died; he was entombed there, as was his wish.&lt;ref name = "duquesa2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony in the ''[[pleitos colombinos]]'' by Francisco Medel and Hernán Pérez Mateos, cited in:

It has been claimed that Pinzón's recurring fever was [[syphilis]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example Lisa M. Benton and John Rennie Short, ''Environmental discourse and practice'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1999, {{ISBN|0-631-21114-4}}, p. 40. [https://books.google.com/books?id=D_FK85NDX9YC&amp;pg=PA40 Accessed online] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory that syphilis is of [[New World]] origin and that it was first brought back to Europe by Columbus's crew has been longstanding, and long controversial.&lt;ref name=Downing&gt;Andrew F. Downing, "Were the Sailors of Columbus the First European Syphilitics?", ''The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal'', October 12, 1916, 515:522.

Pusey, "The Beginning of Syphilis", ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', Volume LXIV, number 24, June 12, 1915, 1961:1964. [https://books.google.com/books?id=0uwBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1961 Available online] through [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent [[genetics|genetic]] evidence restores credence to the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Julie Steenhuysen, [http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN1443055520080115 New study blames Columbus for syphilis spread], [[Reuters]], 2008-01-15. Accessed online 2010-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, even if Pinzón contracted it on the voyage, it is extremely unlikely that it was the cause of his death. Tertiary syphilis does not normally show up for 3 to 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000662.htm Syphilis - tertiary], Medline Plus (U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health). Accessed online 2010-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a possibility that some historians have confused Martín Alonso Pinzón with his brother Francisco, who is more plausibly (but still controversially) believed to have had this particular disease.&lt;ref name=Downing /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pusey /&gt; Conversely, there is the possibility that the first outbreak of syphilis among Europeans with no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] was much more virulent than subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;Pusey, p. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernández Duro further writes that Pinzón's "unpardonable crime" was that he had the luck or skill to obtain more gold than Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fernández Duro|1892|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/pinzbonenel00fernrich#page/93/mode/2up p. 93]}} ''"Pero en esa isla, Pinzón tuvo suerte ó maña para obtener más oro que el Almirante. Eso era la soberbia, ese la codicia, eso el crimen imperdonable del capitán de la ''Pinta'' a los ojos de Colón, y no podía ingenuentamente declararla."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Martín Alonso Pínzon was portrayed by [[Tchéky Karyo]] in ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'' and [[Robert Davi]] in ''[[Christopher Columbus: The Discovery]]'', both released in [[1992 in film|1992]].

'''Mary Harlow''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|FSA}} (born 20 October 1956) is an English [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] and [[Classics|classical scholar]]. Her research focuses on various aspects of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[social history]]―such as age, family, dress and textiles―and their impact on the formation of ancient identity. Her approach strongly promotes interdisciplinarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Traditional Textile Craft - an Intangible Heritage?|last=Andersson Strand, Ebert, Harlow, Bjerregaard|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=978-87-998798-0-9|location=|pages=144|quote=To understand the past, and its relationship to our varied presents, requires an open approach to interdisciplinarity. It is essential, to work and learn from craftspeople, archaeologists, anthropologists, economists, artists – and endless other ‘–ists’, and it must become central to further research.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career==
Harlow studied at the [[University of Leicester]] gaining a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Classical Studies and [[PhD]] in Ancient History. After the completion of her PhD she taught briefly at [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], before joining the Institute of Archaeology and Antiquity at the [[University of Birmingham]] as Senior Lecturer in Roman History (1995–2012). Between 1995 and 2000 she was also an Associate Lecturer at the [[Open University]]. In 2000–2002 she held a [[Leverhulme Trust|Leverhulme Research Fellowship]] to study Dress and Identity in Late Antiquity. In 2013 Harlow returned to the University of Leicester where she is now Associate Professor in Ancient History in the school of Archeology and Ancient History.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/archaeology/people/academics/harlow|title=Mary Harlow - University of Leicester|publisher=University of Leicester|access-date=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2011 and 2013 Harlow was also Guest Professor at the Danish National Research Foundation's [[Centre for Textile Research]] (CTR) in [[Copenhagen]], where she took part in the TEMA (Textile Economies in the Mediterranean Area) research project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ctr.hum.ku.dk/about/reports/CTR__rsrapport_2011_with_highlights.pdf|title=CTR annual report 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2015, Harlow has been involved in the international research group ATOM (Ancient Textiles from the Orient to the Mediterranean), in collaboration with CTR and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ctr.hum.ku.dk/about/reports/CTR_2015_Annual_Report.pdf|title=CTR annual report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2018, Harlow was elected a [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries]] (FSA).&lt;ref name="FSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Mar Ballot Results|url=https://www.sal.org.uk/news/2018/03/15-mar-ballot-results/|website=Society of Antiquaries of London|date=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mensheviks''' ({{lang-ru|Меньшевики́}})&lt;ref&gt;The Great Events of the Great War: A.D. 1917. By [[Charles Francis Horne]]. National Alumni [printed by J.J Little &amp; Ives Company, 1920. [https://books.google.com/books?id=k9PRAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA328 p328]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lenin. By Mark Aleksandrovich Aldanov. E. P. Dutton, 1922. [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_wDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 p10]&lt;/ref&gt; were a [[political faction|faction]] in the Russian [[socialist]] movement, the other being the [[Bolsheviks]].

The factions emerged in 1903 following a dispute in the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP) between [[Julius Martov]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]. The dispute originated at the [[2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|2nd Congress of the RSDLP]], ostensibly over minor issues of party organization. Martov's supporters, who were in the minority in a crucial vote on the question of party membership, came to be called Mensheviks, derived from the Russian word {{lang|ru|меньшинство}} (minority), while Lenin's adherents were known as Bolsheviks, from {{lang|ru|большинство}} (majority).&lt;ref&gt;The Mensheviks After October. By Vladimir N. Brovkin. [[Cornell University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mensheviks in the [[Revolution of 1917]]. By John D. Basil.

Gower, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mensheviks in the [[Russian Revolution]]. By Abraham Ascher. Cornell University Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither side held a consistent majority over the course of the 2nd Congress. The split proved to be long-standing and had to do both with pragmatic issues based in history, such as the failed [[1905 Russian Revolution|Revolution of 1905]] and theoretical issues of class leadership, class alliances and interpretations of [[historical materialism]]. While both factions believed that a proletarian revolution was necessary, the Mensheviks generally tended to be more moderate, and more positive towards the [[Liberalism|liberal]] opposition and the peasant-based [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Waiting for the People's Revolution: Martov and Chernov in Revolutionary Russia 1917-1923|jstor = 20170079|journal = Cahiers du Monde Russe et Soviétique|date = 1985-01-01|pages = 375–394|volume = 26|issue = 3/4|first = Jane|last = Burbank|doi=10.3406/cmr.1985.2051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Russian Revolution: A Very Short Introduction|url = https://books.google.com/?id=UYn0p-yL4JgC&amp;pg=PT9&amp;dq=the+russian+revolution+s.a#v=onepage&amp;q=the%2520russian%2520revolution%2520s.a&amp;f=false|publisher = OUP Oxford|date = 2002-02-21|isbn = 9780191578366|first = S.

== History of the split ==
{{Socialism sidebar}}

=== 1903–1906 ===
At the [[2nd Congress of the RSDLP]] in August 1903, Lenin and Martov disagreed, first about which persons should be in the editorial committee of the party newspaper ''[[Iskra]]'' and then about the definition of a "party member" in the future party statute.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad|last = Lenin|first = V.I|publisher = |year = 1903|isbn = |location = Moscow|pages = 26–31, 92–103|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1904/jan/31a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Lenin's formulation required the party member to be a member of one of the party's organizations

* Martov's only stated that he should work under the guidance of a party organization.

Although the difference in definitions was small, with Lenin's being slightly more exclusive, it was indicative of what became an essential difference between the philosophies of the two emerging factions as Lenin argued for a small party of professional revolutionaries with a large fringe of non-party sympathizers and supporters whereas Martov believed it was better to have a large party of activists with broad representation.

Martov's proposal was accepted by the majority of the delegates (28 votes to 23).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; However, after seven delegates stormed out of the Congress—five of them representatives of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]] who left in protest about their own federalist proposal being defeated&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;—Lenin's supporters won a slight majority, which was reflected in the composition of the [[Central Committee]] and the other central party organs elected at the Congress. That was also the reason behind the naming of the factions. It was later hypothesized that Lenin had purposely offended some of the delegates in order to have them leave the meeting in protest, giving him a majority. However, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks were united in voting against the Bundist proposal, which lost 41 to 5.&lt;ref name="johnpoll"&gt;Johnpoll, Bernard K. ''The Politics of Futility; The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917-1943''. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1967. pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the outcome of the Congress, the following years saw the Mensheviks gathering considerable support among regular [[social democrat]]s and effectively building up a parallel party organization.

=== 1906–1917 ===
At the [[4th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|4th Congress of the RSDLP]] in 1906, a reunification was formally achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lenin: 1906/ucong: Statement in Support of Muratov's (Morozov's) Amendment Concerning a Parliamentary Social-Democratic Group|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1906/ucong/6.htm#v10pp65-302|website = www.marxists.org|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the 2nd Congress, the Mensheviks were in the majority from start to finish, yet Martov's definition of a party member, which had prevailed at the 1st Congress, was replaced by Lenin's. On the other hand, numerous disagreements about alliances and strategy emerged. The two factions kept their separate structures and continued to operate separately.

As before, both factions believed that Russia was not developed enough to make socialism possible and that therefore the revolution which they planned, aiming to overthrow the [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist regime]], would be a [[bourgeois-democratic revolution]]. Both believed that the working class had to contribute to this revolution. However, after 1905 the Mensheviks were more inclined to work with the liberal [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] democratic parties such as the [[Constitutional Democrats]] because these would be the "natural" leaders of a bourgeois revolution. In contrast, the Bolsheviks believed that the Constitutional Democrats were not capable of sufficiently radical struggle and tended to advocate alliances with peasant representatives and other radical socialist parties such as the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party|Socialist Revolutionaries]]. In the event of a revolution, this was meant to lead to a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and the peasantry, which would carry the bourgeois revolution to the end. The Mensheviks came to argue for predominantly legal methods and trade union work while the Bolsheviks favoured armed violence.

Some Mensheviks left the party after the defeat of 1905 and joined legal opposition organisations. After a while, Lenin's patience wore out with their compromising and in 1908 he called these Mensheviks "[[Liquidationism|liquidationists]]".

=== 1912 ===
In 1912, the RSDLP had its final split, with the Bolsheviks constituting the [[Communist Party of Soviet Union|Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks)]] and the Mensheviks the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Mensheviks)]].

The Menshevik faction split further in 1914 at the beginning of [[World War I]]. Most Mensheviks opposed the war, but a vocal minority supported it in terms of "national defense".

=== 1917 Revolutions ===
[[File:Mensevikii.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the Menshevik Party at [[Norra Bantorget]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], May 1917 ([[Pavel Axelrod]], [[Julius Martov]] and [[Aleksandr Martynov (Russian politician)|Alexander Martinov]])]]
After the overthrow of the [[Romanov dynasty]] by the [[February Revolution]] in 1917, the Menshevik leadership led by [[Irakli Tsereteli]] demanded that the government pursue a "fair peace without [[annexation]]s", but in the meantime supported the war effort under the slogan of "defense of the revolution". Along with the other major Russian socialist party, the Socialist Revolutionaries ({{lang|ru|эсеры}}), the Mensheviks led the emerging network of [[Soviet (council)|soviet]]s, notably the [[Petrograd Soviet]] in the capital, throughout most of 1917.

With the monarchy gone, many social democrats viewed previous tactical differences between the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks as a thing of the past and a number of local party organizations were merged. When Bolshevik leaders [[Lev Kamenev]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Matvei Muranov]] returned to Petrograd from Siberian exile in early March 1917 and assumed the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, they began exploring the idea of a complete re-unification of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks at the national level, which Menshevik leaders were willing to consider. However, Lenin and his deputy [[Grigory Zinoviev]] returned to Russia from exile in Switzerland on 3 April and re-asserted control of the Bolshevik Party by late April 1917, taking it in a more radical direction. They called for an immediate revolution and transfer of all power to the soviets, which made any re-unification impossible.

In March–April 1917, the Menshevik leadership conditionally supported the newly formed liberal [[Russian Provisional Government]]. After the collapse of the first Provisional Government on 2 May over the issue of annexations, Tsereteli convinced the Mensheviks to strengthen the government for the sake of "saving the revolution" and enter a socialist-liberal coalition with Socialist Revolutionaries and liberal Constitutional Democrats, which they did on 17 May 17. With Martov's return from European exile in early May, the left-wing of the party challenged the party's majority led by Tsereteli at the first post-revolutionary party conference on 9 May, but the right wing prevailed 44–11. From then on, the Mensheviks had at least one representative in the Provisional Government until it was overthrown by the Bolsheviks during the [[October Revolution]].

With Mensheviks and Bolsheviks diverging, Mensheviks and non-factional social democrats returning from exile in Europe and United States in spring-summer of 1917 were forced to take sides. Some re-joined the Mensheviks. Others, like [[Alexandra Kollontai]], joined the Bolsheviks. A significant number, including [[Leon Trotsky]] and [[Adolf Joffe]], joined the non-factional Petrograd-based anti-war group called [[Mezhraiontsy]], which merged with the Bolsheviks in August 1917. A small yet influential group of social democrats associated with [[Maxim Gorky]]'s newspaper ''[[Novaya Zhizn (Mensheviks)|Novaya Zhizn]]'' (''New Life'') refused to join either party.

[[File:Noe Schordania.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Noe Zhordania]], Menshevik leader and [[Prime Minister of Georgia]]]]
This 1917 split in the party crippled the Mensheviks' popularity and they received 3.2% of the vote during the [[Russian Constituent Assembly election, 1917|Russian Constituent Assembly election]] in November 1917 compared to the Bolsheviks' 25% and the Socialist Revolutionaries' 57%. The Mensheviks got just 3.3% of the national vote, but in the Transcaucasus they got 30.2%. 41.7% of their support came from the Transcaucasus and in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], about 75% voted for them.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Henry Radkey, The Election to the Russian Constituent Assembly&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing of the Menshevik Party supported actions against the Bolsheviks while the left-wing, the majority of the Mensheviks at that point, supported the left in the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]]. However, Martov's leftist Menshevik faction refused to break with the right-wing of the party, resulting in their press being sometimes banned and only intermittently available.

The Mensheviks opposed [[War Communism]] and in 1919 suggested an alternative programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiritofcontradiction.eu/bronterre/2012/08/11/what-is-to-be-done-the-menshivik-programme-july-1919 What is to be done: The Menshevik Programme July 1919 | Spirit of Contradiction]. Spiritofcontradiction.eu (2012-08-11). Retrieved on 2013-07-26.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, some anti-war Mensheviks had formed a group called Menshevik-Internationalists. They were active around the newspaper ''Novaya Zhizn'' and took part in the Mezhraiontsy formation. After July 1917 events in Russia, they broke with the Menshevik majority that supported continued war with Germany. The Mensheviks-Internationalists became the hub of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party (of Internationalists). Starting in 1920, right-wing Mensheviks-Internationalists emigrated, some of them pursuing anti-Bolshevik activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mensheviks Wage the Cold War|jstor = 261050|journal = Journal of Contemporary History|date = 1995-01-01|pages = 247–264|volume = 30|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/002200949503000203|first = Andre|last = Liebich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] was a stronghold of the Mensheviks. In [[parliamentary democracy|parliamentary election]]s held on 14 February 1919, they won 81.5% of the votes and the Menshevik leader [[Noe Zhordania]] became [[Prime Minister of Georgia|Prime Minister]]. Prominent members of [[Georgian Menshevik Party]] were [[Noe Ramishvili]], [[Evgeni Gegechkori]], [[Akaki Chkhenkeli]], [[Nikolay Chkheidze]] and Alexandre Lomtatidze. After the occupation of Georgia by the Bolsheviks in 1921, many Georgian Mensheviks led by Zhordania fled to Leuville-sur-Orge, France, where they set up the [[Government of the Democratic Republic of Georgia in Exile]]. In 1930, Ramishvili was assassinated by a Soviet spy in Paris.

Menshevism was finally made illegal after the [[Kronstadt rebellion|Kronstadt uprising]] of 1921. A number of prominent Mensheviks emigrated thereafter. Martov went to Germany, where he established the paper ''Socialist Messenger''. He died in 1923. 

In 1931, the [[1931 Menshevik Trial|Menshevik Trial]] was conducted by Stalin, an early part of the [[Great Purge]].

The ''Messenger'' moved with the Menshevik center from Berlin to Paris in 1933 and then in 1939 to New York City, where it was published until 1965.&lt;ref name="kow"&gt;Kowalski, Werner.

'''Mikhail Kryukov''' (born 1932) is an anthropologist and historian.

Born in [[Moscow]], Kryukov attended [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1954.  He earned an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] in 1955 from Moscow Institute of International Relations, and from the [[Peking University]] in 1962. He earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1965 from the USSR Academy of Sciences. Since 1965, he has been Senior Research Fellow of the [[Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

Kryukov’s major contributions to [[cultural anthropology]] belong to two fields: (1) studies of the [[evolution]] of kinship terminology and (2) the study of long-term dynamics of the [[Culture of China|Chinese]] ethnos. Kryukov undertook the study of the dynamics of [[kinship]] terminology among Eurasian [[ethnic groups]] having deep historical traditions of written records. However, though he seems to consider his results as having universal applicability, they appear to be most applicable to the evolution of kinship terminology in [[Eurasia]] and among the Austronesians. He has shown that among those peoples bifurcate merging systems tended to get transformed either into bifurcate collateral, or generational ones. On the other hand, the lineal kinship terminology developed either from bifurcate collateral ones (this development is most typical for Eurasia), or from generational systems. Note that these are not mere speculations, as Kryukov supported his conclusions with a wealth of diachronic data. Being a sinologist he paid special attention to the evolution of kinship terminology among the Chinese, thoroughly documenting the transition from the bifurcate merging to bifurcate collateral kinship terminology among them in the first millennium BC and its further development up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;For more detail see: The genius of kinship: the phenomenon of human kinship and the global / By German V. Dziebel&lt;/ref&gt;

Kryukov has written over 15 books and 250 articles dealing with his research interests. These include (1968) ''Historical Interpretation of Kinship Terminology''. Moscow: Institute of Ethnography, USSR Academy of Sciences, (1972) ''Chinese Kinship System''. Moscow: Nauka (in Russian), and (1978–1993) a series of monographs (6 vols.) on historical dynamics of  the Chinese ethnos from the 2nd millennium BC to the 20th century (Moscow: Nauka; in Russian).

[[File:Portrait of Montagu Burrows, M.A. Magd. Hall. Fellow All Souls'. Chicele prof. Mod. Hist (4671110).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Montagu Burrows, 1862]]
'''Montagu Burrows''' (27 October 1819 - 10 July 1905) was a British historian. Following a career as an officer in the [[Royal Navy]], he was the first [[Chichele Professor of Modern History]] at [[Oxford University]], holding the Chair from 1862 until his death. He was probably the first academic to lecture on naval history at Oxford or at any university in Britain.

==Early life and naval career==
Born in Hadley, [[England]], the son of a [[Lieutenant-General]] Montagu Burrows (1775–1848) of the [[British Army]] and his wife, Mary Ann Pafford, daughter of Captain Joseph Larcom, Royal Navy, Montagu Burrows attended Kingsmills' Boys School in Southampton and entered the [[Royal Naval College, Portsmouth]] in 1832. In 1834, he joined [[HMS Andromache (1832)|HMS ''Andromache'']] as a midshipman, and then returned to the College as a mate in 1842. He served on anti-piracy patrols on the [[East Indies and China Station|East Indies Station]] under [[Henry Ducie Chads]] and was decorated for his service at the [[bombardment of Acre]] in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Burrows, Captain Montagu|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 57|page=233|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vDsJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burrows became an instructor in gunnery in [[HMS Excellent (1787)|HMS ''Excellent'']] for six years from 1846. Promoted to [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]] in 1852, he decided to study at Oxford and was placed on [[half-pay]].

==Academic career==
While on half pay, Burrows matriculated at [[Magdalen Hall, Oxford]], and read for the final school of [[literae humaniores]]. Obtaining [[British undergraduate degree classification#First class honours|first-class honours]] in 1856, he continued his studies and in 1857 obtained another "first" in the newly established School of Law and History.  He is believed to have been the first person, as well as the oldest, to obtain a "[[British undergraduate degree classification#Double first-class honours|double first]]" at Oxford in these subjects. For the following five years, he tutored students preparing for their examinations and published a popular guide to Oxford undergraduate examinations called ''Pass and Class''.

In 1862, [[All Souls College, Oxford]] established the post of [[Chichele Professor of Modern History]]. Burrows competed for it and was selected as its first occupant over younger competitors, including [[William Stubbs]], [[Edward Augustus Freeman|Edward Freeman]], and [[James Anthony Froude]]. From 1862 until his retirement in 1900, Burrows regularly lectured on the history of the Royal Navy. His most important books on naval history were his biography of Admiral [[Edward Hawke]] (1886). His other works included his memoir of his former commander, Sir [[Henry Ducie Chads]] (1869), a study of the [[Cinque Ports]] (1883), and a contribution to the ''Memoirs of Sir [[Astley Cooper Key]]'' by Vice-Admiral [[Philip Howard Colomb]] (1898).

Burrows was active in Oxford church affairs as chairman of the Oxford branch of the [[English Church Union]] until 1866, secretary of the [[Universities' Mission to Central Africa]], a founder of the Church of Sts Philip and James in [[North Oxford]], president of the Church Schools Managers and Teachers Association, and a member of the group that founded [[Keble College, Oxford]]. He contributed often to the ''Church and State Review'', ''The Churchman'', and ''The Guardian''.

Burrows was chairman of the school of modern history from 1889 to 1893. Due to increasing deafness, he retired from active lecturing in 1900, but remained active in Oxford faculty, city, and church affairs.

==Death==
Burrows died on 10 July 1905 in [[Oxford]], aged 85. He was given a university funeral with the distinction of having his naval sword displayed on his coffin, while naval flags at Portsmouth were dipped for a Fellow of All Souls.

[[Charles Oman]], who had been appointed Deputy Chichele Professor of Modern History in 1900, was elected Burrows' successor in the Chair in December 1905.

==Personal life==
Burrows married Mary Anna, third daughter of [[Whalley-Smythe-Gardiner baronets|Sir James Whalley Smythe Gardiner, 3rd Baronet]], of Roche Court, [[Fareham]], in September 1849.

'''Per Magnus Johansson''' (born 28 September 1950) is a Swedish psychoanalyst, psychotherapist and historian of ideas. Through his research on the history of psychoanalysis in Sweden, Johansson has contributed to the understanding of the heritage of [[Sigmund Freud]] and the psychoanalytical movement in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andkjær Olsen|first1=Ole|title=Freud i Sverige.

Johanssons monographs are mainly written in Swedish, but his work has reached an international audience through articles in encyclopedias and journals within the field of [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erwin (ed.)|first1=Edward|title=The Freud encyclopedia : theory, therapy, and culture|date=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415936774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Mijolla (ed.)|first1=Alain|title=Dictionnaire international de la psychanalyse : concepts, notions, biographies, oeuvres, événements, institutions|date=2005|publisher=Hachette Littératures|location=Paris|isbn=978-2012791459}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Per Magnus|title=Letter From Stockholm|journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=April 2015|volume=96|issue=2|pages=257–272|doi=10.1111/1745-8315.12361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Per Magnus|title=Psychoanalysis in Sweden|journal=Journal für Psychoanalyse|date=2015|volume=56|pages=22–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=Per Magnus|title=Historiography and psychoanalysis|journal=International Forum of Psychoanalysis|date=June 2007|volume=16|issue=2|pages=103–112|doi=10.1080/08037060701300083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johansson is an associate professor in the History of Ideas at the [[University of Gothenburg]] where he in 1999 submitted his doctoral thesis. The title of his thesis was ''Freuds psykoanalys'' (Freud's Psychoanalysis). Each of the pioneers of psychoanalysis in Sweden, [[Poul Bjerre]], Emanuel af Geijerstam, Pehr Henrik Törngren, Ola Andersson, Lajos Székely and Carl Lesche, has a chapter devoted to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johansson|first1=Per Magnus|title=Freuds psykoanalys. Band 2. Arvtagare i Sverige|date=1999|publisher=Daidalos|location=Göteborg|isbn=9789171731227}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Johansson published ''Freuds psykoanalys. Band 3. Arvtagare i Sverige. Del 2'' (Freud's Psychoanalysis. Vol 3. Heirs in Sweden Part 2). In this volume, [[Alfhild Tamm]], Gunnar Nycander, Gösta Harding and Stefi Pedersen, likewise are given their own chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johansson|first1=Per Magnus|title=Freuds psykoanalys. Band 3. Arvtagare i Sverige. Del 2|date=2003|publisher=Daidalos|location=Göteborg|isbn=9789171731876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having thus described the reception of Freud and psychoanalysis from a Swedish perspective, Johansson devoted a fourth volume (2009) to the situation of psychiatry and clinical psychology in Gothenburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johansson|first1=Per Magnus|title=Freuds psykoanalys. Band 4. Inblickar i psykiatrins och den psykodynamiska terapins historia i Göteborg 1945-2009|date=2009|publisher=Daidalos|location=Göteborg|isbn=9789171732989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the French psychoanalyst and historian Elisabeth Roudinesco, Johansson has introduced the Swedish psychoanalyst and researcher Ola Andersson in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andersson|first1=Ola|title=Freud avant Freud : la préhistoire de la psychanalyse (1886-1896)|date=1997|publisher=Synthélabo|location=Le Plessis-Robinson|isbn=2-908602-86-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also critically read and introduced the Swedish translations of several texts by Sigmund Freud and Michel Foucault.

Psychoanalysis and the Humanities, a collection of essays, was published in 2014. Here, Johansson deals with the complex encounter between psychoanalysis and the humanities, elucidating the subject from a number of various perspectives, cultural, historical, theoretical, practical, and clinical as well as personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johansson|first1=Per Magnus|title=Psykoanalys och humaniora|date=2014|publisher=Daidalos|location=Göteborg|isbn=9789171734266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Freudian Association in Gothenburg==

In his hometown Gothenburg, Johansson has founded Freudianska föreningen (The Freudian Association), which arranges seminars and lectures. Johansson is founder, editor in chief, and publisher of Arche – a journal with an interest in psychoanalysis, the humanities, and architecture (previously Psykoanalytisk Tid/Skrift). In the journal, Johansson has published interviews with several French psychoanalysts, such as René Major, [[Elisabeth Roudinesco]], [[Julia Kristeva]], Roland Gori, Charles Melman, and [[Catherine Millot]]. Arche was in 2018 awarded the prize as cultural magazine of the year in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freudianska.org/tidskrift/Arche-Award-2018.pdf|title=Arche awarded prize as cultural magazine of the year|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honorary memberships==

In 2006, Johansson was awarded the distinction [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] by the French Ministry of Education. On 26 March 2012, Johansson was elected honorary member of the Swedish Psychoanalytical Association, a constituent organization of the [[International Psychoanalytical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honorary Members|url=http://www.spaf.a.se/spaf/medlemslista-ord.htm|website=Svenska psykoanalytiska föreningen|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Johansson was elected member of the Royal Society of Arts and Sciences in Gothenburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members in the Royal Society for Arts and Sciences in Gothenburg|url=http://www.spaf.a.se/spaf/medlemslista-ord.htm|website=Royal Society for Art and Sciences in Gothenburg|accessdate=30 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HOpoppers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A selection of poppers]]
'''Poppers''' is a [[slang|slang term]] given broadly to the [[chemical class]] called [[alkyl nitrites]], that are [[inhalant|inhaled]] for [[recreational drug]] purposes, typically for the "high" or "rush" that the drug can create. Poppers have also been historically used for [[sexual intercourse|sexual encounters]] among youth, including in the [[LGBT community|gay community]].&lt;ref name="poppers-gay-culture"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/poppers-how-gay-culture-bottled-a-formula-that-has-broken-down-boundaries-a6828466.html |title=How gay culture bottled a formula that has broken down boundaries |date=2016-01-22 |newspaper=The Independent |language=en-GB |access-date=2017-01-23 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If you trace the bottle of amyl (a type of alkyl nitrite) through late 20th&amp;nbsp;century history, you trace the legacies of gay culture on popular culture in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="poppers-gay-culture" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Poppers were part of club culture from the mid-1970s [[disco]] scene to the 1980s, and the 1990s [[rave]] scene made their use popular again.&lt;ref name="Drugscope"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugscope.org.uk/druginfo/drugsearch/ds_results.asp?file=%5Cwip%5C11%5C1%5C1%5Cnitrites.html |title=Nitrites |accessdate=2007-04-24 |work=Drugscope |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405132026/http://www.drugscope.org.uk/druginfo/drugsearch/ds_results.asp?file=%5Cwip%5C11%5C1%5C1%5Cnitrites.html |archivedate=2007-04-05 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, to evade anti-drug laws, poppers are labelled or packaged as room deodorizers, leather polish, or tape head cleaner.

==History==
{{expand section | a sourced paragraph on the transition from its use in medicine to its use as a recreational drug | small = no|date=June 2016}}
The French chemist [[Antoine Jérôme Balard]] synthesized [[amyl nitrite]] in 1844.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} [[Sir Thomas Lauder Brunton]], a Scottish physician born in the year of amyl nitrite's first synthesis, famously pioneered its use to treat [[angina pectoris]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Brunton was inspired by earlier work with the same agent, performed by [[Arthur Gamgee]] and [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Brunton reasoned that the angina sufferer's pain and discomfort could be reduced by administering amyl nitrite—to dilate the coronary arteries of patients, thus improving blood flow to the heart muscle.{{Citation needed|date= April 2014}}

Although amyl nitrite is known to have been used recreationally as early as the 1960s, the poppers "craze" began around 1975.&lt;ref name=Craze&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Israelstam |first1=Stephen |last2=Lambert |first2=Sylvia |last3=Oki |first3=Gustave |title=Poppers, a new recreational drug craze |journal=Canadian Psychiatric Association Journal |date=26 April 2017 |volume=23 |issue=7 |pages=493–495 |doi=10.1177/070674377802300711 |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/070674377802300711 |accessdate=25 November 2017 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sold in fragile glass ampoules which are crushed or "popped" in the fingers and then inhaled: Hence the colloquialism ''poppers''.&lt;ref name=Craze/&gt; The term extended to the drug in any form as well as the commercial variant of the drug, [[butyl nitrite]], which is packaged under a variety of trade names in small bottles.&lt;ref name=Craze/&gt;

==Pharmacology and physiology==
{{expand section|a succinct, secondary sourced-statement of the physiologic impact of inhalation of alkyl nitrite-containing poppers | small = no|date=June 2016}}
Inhaling nitrites relaxes [[smooth muscle]]s throughout the body, including the [[sphincter]] muscles of the [[anus]] and the [[vagina]].&lt;ref name="Medsafe"&gt;{{cite web |title=Amyl Nitrite |work=Medsafe |publisher=New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority |date=May 18, 2000 |url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/datasheet/a/Amylnitrateinh.htm |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111105814/http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/datasheet/a/Amylnitrateinh.htm |archivedate=November 11, 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smooth muscle surrounds the body's blood vessels and when relaxed causes these vessels to dilate resulting in an immediate increase in [[heart rate]] and blood flow throughout the body, producing a sensation of heat and excitement that usually lasts for a couple of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.drugs.com/ppa/amyl-nitrite.html |title=Amyl Nitrite (Professional Patient Advice) - Drugs.com |work=drugs.com |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/adf-drug-facts-amyl-nitrite/ |title=ADF - Drug Facts - Amyl Nitrite |work=ADF - Alcohol &amp; Drug Foundation |access-date=2018-10-25 |language=en-US |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these vessels dilate, a further result is an immediate decrease in [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/508179/Poppersadvice.pdf |title=ACMD review of alkyl nitrites ("poppers") |last=Iversen |first=Les |date=March 16, 2016 |website=gov.uk |publisher=www.gov.uk |access-date=October 10, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

===Administration===
Poppers are inhaled.

This is typically done through the nasal or oral cavities, and any conditions which adversely affect the use of the respiratory system should be taken into account before administration commences.

[[File:Poppers.jpg|thumb|A selection of poppers]]
Through the 1970s, use by minors has been described as minimal, due to the ban on sales to minors by major manufacturers (for public relations reasons), and because some jurisdictions regulate sales to minors by statute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nickerson, Mark |author2=Parker, John |author3=Lowry, Thomas |author4=Swenson, Edward |year=1979 |title=Isobutyl Nitrite and Related Compounds |chapter=Sociology and Behavioral Effects |edition=1st |location=San Francisco, CA |publisher=Pharmex, Ltd.}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|6|29}} A 1987 study commissioned by the United States Senate and conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services found that less than three per cent of the overall population had ever used poppers.&lt;ref name = "Kennedy-1988"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kennedy, Edward (committee chair) |year=1988 |publisher=US Senate |department=Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources |series=Report of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources |title=Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Amendments of 1988 |at=Section 4015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|6|29}}

===Interactions===
Alkyl nitrites [[Drug interaction|interact]] with other [[vasodilators]], such as [[sildenafil]] (Viagra), [[vardenafil]] (Levitra), and [[tadalafil]] (Cialis), to cause a serious [[hypotension|decrease in blood pressure]], which can cause fainting, stroke, and low blood pressure leading to potential heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Romanelli |first1=F. |last2=Smith |first2=K.M. |title=Recreational use of sildenafil by HIV-positive and -negative homosexual/bisexual males |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=1024–1030 |date=Jun 2004 |doi=10.1345/aph.1D571 |pmid=15113986}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2016|6|29}}

===Controversial link with HIV/AIDS===
Early in the [[AIDS]] crisis, widespread use of poppers among AIDS patients led to the later disproved hypothesis that poppers contributed to the development of [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], a rare form of cancer, which occurs in AIDS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Duesberg |first1=P |year=2003 |title=The chemical bases of the various AIDS epidemics: Recreational drugs, anti-viral chemotherapy, and malnutrition |journal=J Biosci |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=383–412}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schechter |first1=M T |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(93)90421-c |title=HIV-1 and the aetiology of AIDS |journal=Lancet |volume=341 |pages=658–659 |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modest, short-term reductions in immune function were observed in animal studies,&lt;ref name=Romanelli&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1592/phco.24.1.69.34801 |volume=24 |title=Poppers: Epidemiology and Clinical Management of Inhaled Nitrite Abuse |journal=Pharmacotherapy |pages=69–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11366993 |issue=317 |title=Poppers: large cancer increase and immune suppression in animal tests |journal=AIDS Treat News |pages=1–2 |last1=James |first1=J S}}&lt;/ref&gt; but direct support for a role of nitrites in development of AIDS-associated diseases has not found broad agreement.&lt;ref&gt;NAM [National AIDS Manual], "Poppers", http://www.aidsmap.com/Poppers/page/1322957/.

==Legal status==

===Australia===
It is illegal to sell poppers as inhalants in Australia, although some, including amyl nitrite, are often sold in sex shops misleadingly labeled as DVD or leather cleaner.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/man-dead-rainbow-serpent-drunk-amyl-nitrate-poppers-sources-say/8227740&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Since 2007, reformulated poppers containing [[isopropyl nitrite]] are sold in Europe; isobutyl nitrite is prohibited.&lt;ref name="eur-lex.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2006%3A033%3A0028%3A0081%3Aen%3APDF |title=Directive 2005/90/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council |publisher=Official Journal of the European Union |date=January 18, 2006 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
In France, the sale of products containing butyl nitrite has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?dateTexte=20090901&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000166136 |title=Decree 90–274 of 26 March 1990 |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?dateTexte=20090901&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000341445 |title=Decree 2007-1636 of 20 November 2007 |language=fr |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |accessdate=July 26, 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After litigation by sex shop owners, this extension was quashed by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] on the grounds that the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000020868995 |title=Conseil d'État, 10ème et 9ème sous-sections réunies, 15/05/2009, 312449, Publié au recueil Lebon |language=fr |website=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=May 15, 2009 |accessdate=January 11, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany, Austria, Switzerland====

The possession in the German speaking countries is not subject to any regulations regarding anesthetic drugs and is therefore legal; however, the purchase, sale or trade of amyl nitrite without permission violates the drug laws of the corresponding countries. Occasionally, poppers were seized from sex shops, when sold there illegally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.de/reisen-und-leben/855244035/zur-ekstase-geschnueffelt/1/ |title=Sexdroge Poppers: Zur Ekstase geschnüffelt |website=news.de |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article182967/Poppers-sichergestellt.html |title=„Poppers“ sichergestellt.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, poppers are sold in [[nightclub]]s, [[bar]]s, [[sex shop]]s, drug paraphernalia [[head shops]], over the Internet, and in markets. It is illegal under [[Medicines Act 1968]] to sell them advertised for human consumption. The [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] noted in 2011 that poppers, rather than being psychoactive substance or 'legal high', "appear to fall within the scope of [[The Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985]]".&lt;ref name=acmd&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/119139/acmdnps2011.pdf |title=Consideration of the Novel Psychoactive Substances (‘Legal Highs’) |publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs |pages=52–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Psychoactive Substances Act 2016]], scheduled to be enacted April 1, 2016, was initially claimed to impose a blanket ban on the production, import and distribution of all poppers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2015-2016/0002/16002.pdf publications.parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2016 a motion to exempt poppers (alkyl nitrites) from this legislation was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmhansrd/cm160120/debtext/160120-0003.htm#16012033005245 |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 20 January 2016  (pt 0003) |work=parliament.uk |accessdate=June 29, 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was opposed by Conservative MP [[Ben Howlett (politician)|Ben Howlett]]. Howlett's fellow Conservative MP [[Crispin Blunt]] declared that he has used and currently uses poppers. Manufacturers expressed concern over loss of business and potential unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sutcliffe |first1=Robert |title=UK's biggest poppers manufacturer vows to fight legal high ban on product he's made for 35 years |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uks-biggest-poppers-manufacturer-vows-7373648 |publisher=Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tayag |first1=Yasmin|title=The UK is at war with synthetic drugs and brain boosters are in the crossfire |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/11351-england-s-psychoactive-substances-act-puts-nootropic-poppers-on-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] stated that, because alkyl nitrites do not directly stimulate or depress the [[central nervous system]], poppers do not fall within the scope of the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/poppers-are-so-harmless-they-dont-even-fall-under-the-governments-legal-highs-ban-acmd-says-a6934096.html |title=The Government thought it had banned Poppers but actually accidentally didn't |website=The Independent |language=en-GB |accessdate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the US, amyl nitrite was originally marketed as a prescription drug in 1937 and remained so until 1960, when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] removed the prescription requirement due to its food safety record. This requirement was reinstated in 1969, after observation of an increase in recreational use.

Other alkyl nitrites were outlawed in the US by Congress through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The law includes an exception for ''commercial purpose'', defined as any use other than for the production of consumer products containing volatile alkyl nitrites meant for inhaling or otherwise introducing volatile alkyl nitrites into the human body for euphoric or physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Public Law 1QO-690, section 2404) (15 U.S.C. 2d57a(e)(2)).&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into effect in 1990.

Substances containing alkyl nitrites other than amyl nitrite are available at many retailers{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} – typically sex shops and stores that sell recreational-drug paraphernalia – and may be purchased legally.

The bombing of {{ship|RFA|Fort Victoria|A387|6}} took place on 6 September 1990, when a unit of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) planted two bombs aboard the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] replenishment ship at [[Harland and Wolff]] shipyard in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], where the vessel had been launched four months before. One of them exploded in the engine room, causing flooding and serious damage. The second device didn't explode and was defused several days later. The attack resulted in a two-year delay before ''Fort Victoria'' became fully operational.

==Early IRA actions against shipping==

{{See also|Attacks on shipping in Lough Foyle (1981–1982)}}

One of the first [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|IRA]] attacks on British ships since the [[Irish War of Independence]] was carried out against the [[Royal Navy]] fast-attack patrol boat HMS ''[[Brave-class fast patrol boat|Brave Borderer]]'', which was damaged by gunfire from a [[Boys anti-tank rifle]] in September 1965 while paying a visit to [[Waterford]], Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;White, Robert Williams (2006). ''Ruairí Ó Brádaigh: the life and politics of an Irish revolutionary''. Indiana University Press, p. 130. {{ISBN|0-253-34708-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another noteworthy operation against a British ship took place in April 1971, when the [[Royal Navy]] survey launch HMS ''Stork'' was towed outside the port and blown up by the IRA off [[Baltimore, Ireland|Baltimore]], also in the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19710422&amp;id=BlIVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ceUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4183,7611495 The Sydney Morning Herald – 22 Abr 1971]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Ireland itself, two civilian coal ships, ''Nellie M'' and ''St Bedan'', were boarded, bombed and sunk by the Provisional IRA between 1981 and 1982 in [[Lough Foyle]].

==Provisional IRA attack==
''Fort Victoria'' is a 31,565 ton fleet stores ship and tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary which had been ordered from [[Harland and Wolff]] on 24 April 1986, and eventually launched on 4 May 1990. The name of ''Fort Victoria'' was officially bestowed by [[Sarah, Duchess of York|The Duchess of York]], on 19 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalrfa.org/rfa-fort-victoria-ship-information Historical RFA – RFA Fort Victoria]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 1990, while at dock and less than three months after being christened, a Provisional IRA unit planted two explosive devices on board. After a telephone warning from the IRA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-09-07/news/mn-657_1_british-navy Explosion Rips British Navy Ship in Belfast] [[Reuters]], 7 September 1990&lt;/ref&gt; one of the bombs exploded, causing extensive damage inside the engine room, which was holed and subsequently flooded. The ship listed 45 degrees, and the chances of sinking were high. The situation was under control after hours of work by emergency teams, which pumped the water out of the engine room. John Parker, the shipbuilder, praised the courage of the engineers for saving the ship. It was not learned that a second device had failed to explode until a second IRA phone call 24 hours later. It took two weeks to find and disable the second bomb, which stalled the works further.&lt;ref name=rep&gt;From an interview to shipbuilder Sir John Parker published by ''[[Sunday Times]]'', 13 March 2006: :''The contract for Fort Victoria was won, but the ship became a target for the IRA. "She was afloat in the dock when we got the call from the IRA. Later that day the bomb went off and blew a hole in the engine room of the ship. The ship heeled over to about 45 degrees and we thought we were going to lose her. Fortunately some very courageous engineers went on board and lowered pumps in to clear the engine room so we could save the ship." The next day there was a call about a second bomb. It took two weeks to find it and make it safe – valuable time lost. Such incidents moulded Sir John and taught him patience and resolve, the like of which is rare in many boardrooms.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ph&gt;[http://republican-news.org/archive/2000/September13/13back.html IRA bombs British Navy ship] ''An Phoblacht'', 13 September 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

''Fort Victoria'' eventually sailed from Belfast for sea trials on 29 June 1992, two years later than initially scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toysoutofthepram.com/Ships_of_the_RFA/rfa_fort_victoria_a387.html RFA Fort Victoria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227145933/http://www.toysoutofthepram.com/Ships_of_the_RFA/rfa_fort_victoria_a387.html |date=27 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some politicians claimed that the attack was aimed at the personnel of the shipyard. Irish republican newspaper ''[[An Phoblacht]]'' called this "nonsense". It added: "The logic of their argument would dictate that any military action by any army anywhere is unjustified because civilian workers were involved in the construction of the enemy's machinery. This was an attack on a prestigious piece of British military hardware".

'''Rui''' (or '''Ruy''') '''de Pina''' (1440–1522) was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[chronicler]].

==Biography==
Rui (or Ruy) de Pina was a native of [[Guarda, Portugal|Guarda]].  He acted as secretary of the embassy sent by King [[John II of Portugal]] to [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] in the spring of 1482, and in the following September returned there as sole envoy. He was present at the execution of [[Fernando II, 3rd Duke of Braganza|Fernando II]], [[Duke of Braganza]] at [[Évora]] in 1483, and in 1484 went to Rome as secretary of an embassy to [[Pope Innocent VIII]].  Upon his return, the king charged him to write a history of his reign and gave him a pension for his support.

Following the return of [[Christopher Columbus]] from his first voyage in 1493, Pina was one of the commissaries dispatched to Barcelona by John II to negotiate with the [[Catholic monarchs|Catholic sovereigns]] respecting the limits of their respective jurisdictions, that would culminate in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494. In September 1495 he attested the will of John II in his capacity as a notary public, and on 25 October of the same year he was present at his master's death at [[Alvor (Portimão)|Alvor]] and opened and read his testament.

The new king, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]], confirmed his pension and in 1497 appointed him high chronicler (''cronista-mor'') of the kingdom, keeper of the [[Arquivo Nacional da Torre do Tombo|archives of Torre do Tombo]] and royal librarian, with a suitable salary. By 1504 Rui de Pina had completed his chronicles of [[Afonso V]] and [[John II of Portugal|John II]]. In 1521, [[John III of Portugal|King John III]] charged him with a history of his father, [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]], and at his death Pina had carried it down to the [[Battle of Azamor|capture of Azamor]], as we know from [[Damião de Góis]], who used it in preparing his own chronicle of that monarch.

==Chronicles==

It is probable that the chronicles of the early kings of Portugal from [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] to [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] which were published under Pina's name in the 18th century were written by [[Fernão Lopes]] and edited by Pina, while that of King [[Edward of Portugal|Duarte]] seems to have been the joint production of Lopes and [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]], with Pina again as the editor only.

Pina was a favorite of fortune during his life, for, apart from royal benefactions, he received presents from public men who wished to figure well in his books, and after his death he obtained the credit for work that was not his. His authority as an historian is considerable, and his frankness is said to have provoked remark from contemporaries.

Pinas' chronicle of King AFonso IV was first published in Lisbon in 1853; those of King Duarte and King Afonso V in vol. i of the Colecção de livros inéditos da historia portugueza (Lisbon, 1790), and his chronicle of John II in vol. ii of the same collection (Lisbon, 1792).  

Ruy de Pina was immensely influential in his day.  [[Afonso de Albuquerque]], governor of [[Portuguese India]], is said to have sent a set of jewels to Ruy de Pina, in an effort to ensure that he would not be overlooked in his chronicles.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Herculano, in preface to Ruy de Pina ''Chronica d'el-rei Dom Duarte'', 1901, Lisbon: Escriptoria, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction to the chronicle of King Duarte contains the fullest account of Pinas' life.

The '''Second Battle Group controversy''' refers to the [[BBC]] investigation into a [[World War II reenactment]] group that portrays the SS Division [[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]] of [[Nazi Germany]].

==Controversy==
The SBG were the focus of a BBC documentary broadcast on the evening of the 27 August 2007, entitled ''Weekend Nazis''. Two SBG members were covertly filmed expressing racist views.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1561261/Neo-Nazis-infiltrate-WWII-re-enactment-group.html| work=Daily Telegraph| date=2007-08-27| title=Neo-Nazis infiltrate WWII re-enactment group| accessdate=2007-09-05 | location=London | first=Graham | last=Tibbetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The SBG later issued the following statement through their lawyers: "The views alleged to have been made by members of the SBG are, in the opinion of the SBG, fascist, racist and utterly reprehensible and as such are views we strongly oppose."&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;

Sequoyah's heroic status has led to several competing accounts of his life that are speculative, contradictory, or fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Raymond D.|last=Fogelson|year=1974|title=On the Varieties of Indian History: Sequoyah and Traveller Bird|journal=Journal of Ethnic Studies|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by John B. Davis, there were very few primary documents describing facts of Sequoyah's life. Some anecdotes were passed down orally, but these often conflict or are vague about times and places.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=John B.|work=Chronicles of Oklahoma|volume=8, Number 2|title=The Life and Work of Sequoyah|date=June 1930|accessdate=20 November 2017|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v008/v008p149.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028175529/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v008/v008p149.html|archivedate=28 October 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sequoyah was born in the Cherokee town of [[Tuskegee (Cherokee town)|Tuskegee]] circa 1770. [[James Mooney]], a prominent [[anthropologist]] and [[historian]] of the Cherokee people, quoted a cousin as saying that as a little boy, he spent his early years with his mother. Estimates of his birth year ranged from 1760 to 1776. His name is believed to come from the Cherokee word ''siqua'' meaning '[[Domestic pig|hog]]'. However, Davis says the name may have been derived from ''sikwa'' (either a hog or an [[opossum]]) and ''vi'' meaning a place or an enclosure.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; This is a reference either to a childhood deformity or to a later injury that left Sequoyah [[Disability|disabled]].&lt;ref&gt;London, 193&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother, ''Wut-teh'', was known to be Cherokee. Mooney stated that she was the niece of a Cherokee [[Tribal chief|chief]]. McKinney and Hall noted that she was a niece of chiefs who have been identified as the brothers [[Old Tassel]] and [[Doublehead]]. Since [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts]] (also known as Young Tassel) was a nephew of the two chiefs, it is likely that Wut-teh and John Watts were cousins.

Sources differ as to the identity of Sequoyah's father. Davis cites Emmet Starr's book, ''Early History of the Cherokees'', as the source for saying that Sequoyah's father was a peddler from [[Swabia]] named Guyst, Guist, or Gist.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; According to Goodpasture, some believe the father was an unlicensed German peddler named George Gist, who came into the Cherokee Nation in 1768, where he married and fathered a child.&lt;ref name = "Goodpasture"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodpasture|first= Albert V. |work=Chronicles of Oklahoma'' |volume= 1, No. 2|date=October 1921|title=The Paternity of Sequoya the Inventor of the Cherokee Alphabet|accessdate= 4 April 2013|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/Chronicles/v001/v001p121.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant Foreman identified him as [[Nathaniel Gist]], son of a Christopher Gist, who later became a commissioned officer with the [[Continental Army]] associated with [[George Washington]].&lt;ref name="Sequoya"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v015/v015p003.html |title=The Father of Sequoyah: Nathaniel Gist |author=Samuel C.

&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'', published in 1828, stated that Sequoyah's father was a half-blood and his grandfather a white man.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc"&gt;{{cite news|author=G. C.|date=1820-08-13|title=Invention of the Cherokee Alphabet|work=Cherokee Phoenix|volume=1|number=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'' presents another version of Sequoyah's origins, from the 1971 book, ''Tell Them They Lie: The Sequoyah Myth'', by Traveller Bird, who claims to be a Sequoyah descendant. Bird says that Sequoyah was a full-blood Cherokee who always opposed the submission and assimilation of his people into the white man's culture. The encyclopedia noted that Bird presented no documentary evidence, but has gained some credibility in academic circles.&lt;ref name="NGE-Sequoyah"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wadley|first= Ted|work= New Georgia Encyclopedia|title= Sequoyah|year= 2002|accessdate= 6 April 2013|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-618&amp;sug=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case the father was absent before Sequoyah was born. Various explanations have been proposed, but the reason is unknown. Wuteh did not remarry afterward (assuming she married her son's father in the first place). There were no siblings, and Sequoyah was raised by his mother alone.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; According to Davis, Sequoyah never went to school and never learned English. He and Wuteh spoke only Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Langguth"&gt;Langguth, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; As a youth, he spent much of his time tending cattle and working in their garden, while his mother ran a trading post.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Sequoyah became lame early in life, though why, when and where are not known. Some reports indicate this may have been caused by injury in battle; others say the cause was a hunting accident. Davis wrote that an early issue of the ''Cherokee Advocate'' said that "...he was the victim of a hydrarthritic trouble of the knee joint, commonly called 'white swelling'." One doctor speculated that he had [[Anasarca|anascara]] (''sic'').&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; In any case, lameness prevented him from being a successful farmer or warrior.

Despite his lack of schooling, Sequoyah displayed a good deal of natural intelligence. As a child, he had devised and built milk troughs and skimmers for the dairy house that he had constructed. As he grew older and came in contact with more white men, he learned how to make jewelry. He became a noted silversmith, creating various items from the silver coins that trappers and traders carried. He never signed his pieces, so there are none that can be positively identified as his work.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Sequoyah may have taken over his mother's trading post after her death, which Davis claimed occurred about the end of the 18th Century. His store became an informal meeting place for Cherokee men to socialize and, especially, drink whiskey. Sequoyah developed a great fondness for alcohol and soon spent much of his time drunk. After a few months he was rarely seen sober, neglecting his farm and trading business and spending his money buying liquor by the keg.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Fortunately, he realized that he was ruining his life, and took up new interests. He began to draw. Then he took up blacksmithing, so he could repair the iron farm implements that had recently been introduced to the area. Self-taught as usual, he made his own tools, forge and bellows. He was soon doing a good business either repairing items or selling items he had created himself. His spurs and bridle bits were in great demand because he liked to decorate them with silver. Although he maintained his store, he not only stopped drinking but stopped selling alcohol.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

===Move to Alabama===
[[File:Horseshoe bend map.jpg|alt=Map of battle lines|thumb|After moving to Alabama, Sequoyah took part in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]].]]
It is unclear when Sequoyah moved to Alabama from Tennessee. Some sources claim he went with his mother, though there is no confirmed date for her death. Others have stated that it was before 1809, when he started his work on the Cherokee Syllabary. Another source claims it was in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=exploresouthernhistory.com|title= Wills Town Mission and Cemetery, Alabama|accessdate= 9 April 2013|url=http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/fortpayne2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this date is too late, because he was already living in Alabama when he enlisted in the army. In 1813–14, Sequoyah served as a warrior of the Cherokee Regiment (Col. Gideon Morgan, Commander) at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] against the "[[Red Sticks]]" (Creek, or Muskogee, renegades).&lt;ref name="EOAHC-Sequoyah"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abram|first= Susan M. |work=Encyclopedia of Alabama History|title= Sequoyah|accessdate=7 April 2013|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2159}}&lt;/ref&gt; His white comrades called him either George Guess or George Gist.&lt;ref&gt;Langguth, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Alabama'' states that Sequoyah married Sally Benge in 1815.&lt;ref name="EOAHC-Sequoyah"/&gt;

==Sequoyah and Cherokee literacy==
As a silversmith, Sequoyah dealt regularly with whites who had settled in the area. He was impressed by their [[writing]], referring to their correspondence as "talking leaves". He knew that they represented a way to transmit information to other people in distant places. However, a majority of the Cherokees believed that writing was either sorcery, a special gift, or a pretense. Sequoyah accepted none of these explanations. He said that he could invent a way for Cherokees to talk on paper, even though his friends and family thought the idea was ridiculous.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

===Creation of the syllabary===
{{Main|Cherokee syllabary}}
[[File:Sequoyah Arranged Syllabary.png|thumb|left|'''Sequoyah's syllabary''' in the order that he originally arranged the characters.]]

Around 1809, Sequoyah began creating a system of writing for the Cherokee language.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; At first he sought to create a [[Logogram|character for each word]] in the language. He spent a year on this effort, leaving his fields unplanted, so that his friends and neighbors thought he had lost his mind.&lt;ref name="gc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boudinot"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Elias|last=Boudinot|title=Invention of a New Alphabet|date=1832-04-01|work=American Annals of Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife is said to have burned his initial work, believing it to be [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He realized that this approach was impractical because it would require too many pictures to be remembered. He tried making a symbol for every idea, but this also caused too many problems to be practical.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Sequoyah decided to develop a symbol for each syllable in the language. After approximately a month, he had a system of 86 [[Grapheme|characters]], some of which were [[Latin script|Latin]] letters he obtained from a spelling book.&lt;ref name="gc"/&gt; "In their present form, many of the syllabary characters resemble Roman, [[Cyrillic]] or [[Greek letters]] or [[Arabic numerals]]," says Janine Scancarelli, a scholar of Cherokee writing, "but there is no apparent relationship between their sounds in other languages and in Cherokee."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

===Teaching the syllabary===
Sequoyah first taught the syllabary to his six-year old&lt;ref&gt;Langguth, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; daughter, ''Ayokeh'' (also spelled Ayoka), because he could not find adults willing to learn it.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; He traveled to the Indian Reserves in the [[Arkansaw Territory]] where some Cherokee had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary's usefulness, they doubted him. Sequoyah asked each leader to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokee that he had created a practical writing system.&lt;ref name="boudinot"/&gt;
[[File:Cherokeephoenix-5-1828.png|alt=A cover to a newspaper|thumb|The ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'' was an early publication to use the Cherokee syllabary.]] When Sequoyah returned east, he brought a sealed envelope containing a written speech from one of the Arkansas Cherokee leaders. By reading this speech, he convinced the eastern Cherokee also to learn the system, after which it spread rapidly.&lt;ref name="gc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boudinot"/&gt;

In 1824, the General Council of the Eastern Cherokees awarded Sequoyah a large silver medal in honor of the syllabary. According to Davis, one side of the medal bore his image surrounded by the inscription in English, "Presented to George Gist by the General Council of the Cherokee for his ingenuity in the invention of the Cherokee Alphabet." The reverse side showed two long-stemmed pipes and the same inscription written in Cherokee. Supposedly, Sequoyah wore the medal throughout the rest of his life and it was buried with him.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

===Use of the syllabary in official documents and print===

In 1825 the Cherokee Nation officially adopted the writing system. In 1826, the Cherokee National Council commissioned George Lowrey and David Brown to translate and print eight copies of the laws of the Cherokee Nation in the Cherokee language using Sequoyah's new system.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; From 1828 to 1834, American missionaries assisted the Cherokee in using Sequoyah's syllabary to develop type characters and print the ''[[Cherokee Phoenix]]'', the first [[newspaper]] of the Cherokee Nation, with text in both Cherokee and English.&lt;ref name="Sequoyah"/&gt;

===Impact of Sequoyah's syllabary beyond the Cherokee===

The news that an illiterate Cherokee had created a syllabary spread throughout the USA. A missionary working in northern Alaska read about it and created a syllabary, what has become known as [[Cree syllabics]]. This syllabic writing inspired other groups across Canada to adapt the syllabics to their languages. A literate Cherokee emigrated to Liberia and told about their syllabary, leading a [[Bassa language]] speaker of Liberia to create his own syllabary, which led to others groups in West Africa to follow suit, creating their own syllabaries.  A missionary in China read about the Cree syllabary and was inspired to follow that example in writing a local language in China. The result of all the diffusion of Sequoyah's work is that it has led to 21 scripts devised, used for over 65 languages.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2016. The international impact of Sequoyah’s Cherokee syllabary. Written Language and Literacy 19.1: 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Indian Territory==
[[File:Sequoyahs Cabin.jpg|thumb|Sequoyah's cabin in 2004, near present-day Sallisaw, Oklahoma]]
After the Nation accepted his syllabary in 1825, Sequoyah traveled to the Cherokee lands in the Arkansas Territory. There he set up a [[blacksmith]] shop and a salt works. He continued to teach the syllabary to anyone who wished.

In 1828, Sequoyah journeyed to [[Washington, D.C.]], as part of a [[delegation]] to negotiate a treaty for land in the planned [[Indian Territory]]. While in Washington, D.C., he sat for a formal portrait painted by Charles Bird King (see image at the top of this article). He holds a copy of the syllabary in his left hand and is smoking a long-stemmed pipe. During his trip, he met representatives of other Native American tribes. Inspired by these meetings, he decided to create a syllabary for universal use among Native American tribes. Sequoyah began to journey into areas of present-day [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], to meet with tribes there.

In 1829, Sequoyah moved to a location on [[Big Skin Bayou]], near the present city of [[Sallisaw, Oklahoma]], where he built [[Sequoyah's Cabin]] that became his home for the rest of his life. It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Sequoyah's Cabin|url={{NHLS url|id=66000634}} |format=pdf|date=9 December 1975 |author=Joseph Scott Mendinghall |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NHLS url|id=66000634|title=''Accompanying 4 photos from 1975.''|photos=y}}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.11&amp;nbsp;MB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was operated by the [[Oklahoma Historical Society]] until it was purchased by the Cherokee Nation November 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/11/10/cherokee-nation-purchases-sequoyahs-cabin-oklahoma-historical-society-166402 Indian Country Today November 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, when the Cherokees were bitterly divided over the issue of removal to Indian Territory, Sequoyah joined with [[Jesse Bushyhead]] to try to reunite the Cherokee Nation. Sequoyah, representing the Western Cherokees, and Bushyhead representing the Eastern Cherokees, made a joint plea at a tribal council meeting at Takatoka on 20 June 1839, where they succeeded in getting a voice vote to hold a new council of all Cherokees to resolve the reunification issues.&lt;ref&gt;McLoughlin, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequoyah's last journey and death==

[[File:Map-of-Zaragoza-Coahuila-México.jpg|thumb|1885 map of Zaragoza, Coahuila, México. Notice in parenthesis (S. Fernando de Rosas)]]

Sequoyah dreamed of seeing the splintered Cherokee Nation reunited. In the spring of 1842, Sequoyah began a trip to locate other Cherokee bands who were believed to have fled to Mexico and attempted to persuade them to return to the Cherokee Nation. He was accompanied by his son, Teesy (Chusaleta), as well as other Cherokees identified as Co-tes-ka, Nu-wo-ta-na, Cah-ta-ta, Co-wo-si-ti, John Elijah, and The Worm.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Sometime between 1843 and 1845, he died during a trip to San Fernando de Rosas in Coahuila, [[Mexico]]. The village of San Fernando de Rosas was renamed  as Zaragoza nearly 25 years after Sequoyah's death.

{{Quote|text="In the summer of 1842, influenced perhaps by a desire to explore the Western prairies, and become acquainted with his Red Brethren, who roam them free and untrammlled, Se-quo-yah, having loaded several pack horses with goods, visited, in company with a number of Cherokees, the Cumanche Indians.

[[Image:Supplex Libellus Valachorum Transsilvaniae.jpg|thumb|First page of the petition, printed in Klausenburg (today's [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]])]]

'''''Supplex Libellus Valachorum Transsilvaniae''''' ([[Latin]] for ''[[Petition]] of the [[Romanians]] of [[Transylvania]]'') is the name of two petitions sent by the leaders of the [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]]s of [[Transylvania]] to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], demanding equal political rights with the other ethnicities of Transylvania and a share of the [[Transylvanian Diet]] proportional to their population.

The first Supplex was sent in March 1791 by [[Ignatie Darabant]], the [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic]] [[Greek Catholic Diocese of Oradea Mare|bishop of Oradea]], to the State Council of [[Vienna]]. The second Supplex, a largely expanded and argumented version of the first, was brought before the Imperial Court of Vienna on March 30, 1792, by [[Ioan Bob]], [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek Catholic]] [[bishop]] of [[Blaj]], and by [[Gherasim Adamovici]], [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[bishop]] of [[Transylvania]].

The demands in the petition, according to the researches of David Prodan, were largely based on the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' of [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]], and it also included an essay reviewing historical reasons (such as references to a [[Roman Dacia]]-Romanian continuity{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}) as well as statistics about the Romanians (who made up approximately 55% of the population of Transylvania). According to some more recent researches, the argumentation of the Supplex Libellus Valachorum based on the ideas of [[natural law]] as well as on the Hungarian feudal judicial argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hunghist.org/images/volumes/Volume_5_Issue_1/Kov%C3%A1cs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The document was drafted by the most important representatives of the Romanian nation of Transylvania (which were, for the most part, clerics of the Romanian Greek Catholic Church):  [[Samuil Micu]], [[Petru Maior]], [[Gheorghe Șincai]], [[Ioan Piuariu-Molnar]], [[Iosif Meheși]], [[Ion Budai-Deleanu]], [[Ioan Para]] etc. The petition was signed in the name of the Romanian nation by its free categories: Clerus, Nobilitas, Civicusque Status Universae Nationis in Transilvania Valachicae.

The ''Supplex'' was rejected and, as such, the status of the Romanians remained the same. Several such petitions were issued in the following decades, and they all met with the same reaction. Another major petition, the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]], was drafted a century later (in 1892, following the new circumstances after the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|1848 Revolution]] and the ''[[Ausgleich]]''), but its authors were sent to prison for [[treason]].

&lt;ref name="prasad-on-jr"&gt;Prasad 1999, p. xiv: "Acharya Giridhar Mishra is responsible for many of my interpretations of the epic. The meticulousness of his profound scholarship and his extraordinary dedication to all aspects of Rama's story have led to his recognition as  one of the greatest authorities on Tulasidasa in India today ... that the Acharya's knowledge of the Ramacharitamanasa is vast and breathtaking and that he is one of those rare scholars who know the text of the epic virtually by heart."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Victoria Memorial''' is a large marble building in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]], which was built between 1906 and 1921.

== History ==
[[File:George Curzon2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], Viceroy of India]]

Lord Curzon proposed the construction of a grand building with a museum and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert E. W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=f_S9sNe8f7AC&amp;dq=curzon+viceroy+india+victoria+memorial&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "Flora's empire: British gardens in India."] Penn Studies in Landscape Architecture, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012. p224. {{ISBN|0-8122-0505-7}}, 9780812205053. Accessed at Google Books, 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Curzon said,
{{quote|"Let us, therefore, have a building, stately, spacious, monumental and grand, to which every newcomer in Calcutta will turn, to which all the resident population, European and Native, will flock, where all classes will learn the lessons of history, and see revived before their eyes the marvels of the past."&lt;ref name="dutta"&gt;Dutta K.

[[Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]], later [[George V|King George V]], laid the foundation stone on 4 January 1906, and it was formally opened to the public in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/culture_heritage.php?id=68]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, before the construction of the Victoria Memorial was finished, [[King George V]] announced the transfer of the capital of India from Calcutta to [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. (ed.)

Accessed at Google Books, 13 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Victoria Memorial was built in what would be a provincial city rather than a capital.

== Finance ==
[[File:Victoria by nabarun.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Illumination.]]
The Victoria Memorial was funded by Indian states, individuals of the [[British Raj]] and the British government in London.&lt;ref name="dutta" /&gt; The princes and people of India responded generously to Lord Curzon's appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the monument, amounting to one crore, five lakhs of rupees, was entirely derived from their voluntary subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Victoria Memorial Hall |url=http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/history.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030613111755/http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/history.html |archivedate=13 June 2003 |website=Official Website of the Victoria Memorial Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[File:Victoria memorial 000.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Victoria Memorial]]
The Victoria Memorial's architect was [[William Emerson (British architect)|William Emerson]] (1843–1924), president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kolkatainformation.com/calhert/v_mem.htm "Victoria Memorial."] ''www.kolkatainformation.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kumar R.

The gardens of the Victoria Memorial were designed by [[Lord Redesdale]] and [[David Prain]]. Emerson's assistant, [[Vincent Jerome Esch]], designed the bridge of the north aspect and the garden gates.

=== Vincent J. Esch ===
[[File:Statue of Queen Victoria in front of Victoria Memorial Hall, Calcutta.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Victoria]]
In 1899, Esch was appointed assistant engineer at the [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]], a job which gave him much practical experience in large-scale construction and costings.&lt;ref&gt;Schama S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=V4RABT9O1uQC&amp;dq=%22vincent+esch%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "A History of Britain – volume 3: the fate of the empire 1776 – 2000."] Random House, 2012. {{ISBN|1-4090-1835-0}}, 9781409018353. Accessed at Google Books, 14 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, Emerson engaged Esch to sketch his original design for the Victoria Memorial. After designing the temporary exhibition building for the [[Delhi Durbar]] of 1903, Curzon found Esch to be a suitable assistant for Emerson.&lt;ref&gt;Morris J.

== Construction ==
[[File:Victoria Memorial calcutta.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Construction in progress.]]
The construction of the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's from India in 1905 with a subsequent loss of local enthusiasm for the project, and by the need for testing of the foundations. The Victoria Memorial's [[foundation stone]] was set in 1906 and the building opened in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma A.

=== Use of white Makrana Marble ===
Like the [[Taj Mahal]], the Victoria Memorial is built of white [[Makrana marble]]&lt;ref name="hermann" /&gt; and is a memorial to an [[empress]]. In design, it echos the Taj Mahal with its dome, four subsidiaries, octagonal-domed [[chattris]], high portals, terrace, and domed corner towers.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Royal gallery ===
The Royal Gallery displays a number of portraits of Victoria and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and paintings illustrating their lives, by Jansen and [[Winterhalter]]. The oil paintings are copies of those in London. They include: Victoria receiving the sacrament at her coronation in [[Westminster Abbey]] (June 1838); Victoria's marriage to Albert in the [[Chapel Royal]] at [[St James's Palace]] (1840); the christening of the Prince of Wales in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle (1842); the marriage of the Prince of Wales (Edward VII) to Princess Alexandra (1863); Victoria at the First Jubilee service at Westminster Abbey (1887) and the Second Jubilee service at [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] (June 1897).
Victoria's childhood rosewood [[pianoforte]] and her correspondence desk from [[Windsor Castle]] stand in the centre of the room. Edward VII presented these items to the Victoria Memorial. On the south wall hangs the Russian artist [[Vasily Vereshchagin]]'s oil painting of the state entry of Edward VII, (then Prince of Wales), into [[Jaipur]] in 1876.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/royalgal.html "The Royal gallery."] ''www.victoriamemorial-cal.org''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050224035004/http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/royalgal.html|date=24 February 2005}} Retrieved 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dutta A.

=== Calcutta gallery ===
In the mid 1970s, the matter of a new gallery devoted to the visual history of Calcutta was promoted by [[Saiyid Nurul Hasan]], the minister for education. In 1986, Hasan became the governor of [[West Bengal]] and chairman of the board of trustees of the Victoria Memorial. In November 1988, Hasan hosted an international seminar on the ''Historical perspectives for the Calcutta tercentenary''. The Calcutta gallery concept was agreed and a design was developed leading to the opening of the gallery in 1992.&lt;ref name="dutta" /&gt; The Calcutta gallery houses a visual display of the history and development of Calcutta from [[Job Charnock]] (1630–1692) of the English [[East India Company]] to 1911, when the capital of India was transferred to New Delhi. The gallery also has a life-size   [[diorama]] of [[Chitpur]] road in the late 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/calgallery.html "Calcutta Gallery."] ''www.victoriamemorial-cal.org''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422214037/http://www.victoriamemorial-cal.org/calgallery.html|date=22 April 2016}}.

== Gardens ==
The gardens cover an area of {{convert|64|acre|m2}}. They are maintained by a team of 21 gardeners. They were designed by Redesdale and David Prain. On Esch's bridge, between narrative panels by [[Goscombe John]], there is a bronze statue of Victoria, by [[George Frampton]]. Victoria is seated on her throne, wearing the robes of the [[Most Exalted Order of the Star of India|Star of India]]. In the paved quadrangles and elsewhere around the building, other statues commemorate Hastings, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis (1st Marquess Cornwallis)]], [[Robert Clive]], [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], and [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie]]. Approaching the Victoria Memorial building from the south, visitors pass the Edward VII memorial arch. Upon the arch is a bronze equestrian statue of Edward VII by [[Bertram Mackennal]] and a marble statue of Curzon by [[F. W. Pomeroy|Frederic William Pomeroy]]. The garden contains statues of dignitaries such as [[Lord William Bentinck]], governor-general of India (1833–1835), [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|George Robinson (1st Marquess of Ripon)]], governor-general of India (1880–84), and [[Rajendra Nath Mookerjee]], a pioneer [[industrialist]] of Bengal.&lt;ref name="dutta" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23998">'''Wang Wujun''' (王武俊) (735 – August 9, 801&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&amp;dyna=%AD%F0&amp;king=%BCw%A9v&amp;reign=%ADs%A4%B8&amp;yy=17&amp;ycanzi=&amp;mm=6&amp;dd=&amp;dcanzi=%A4B%A4x&lt;/ref&gt;), [[courtesy name]] '''Yuanying''' (元英), né '''Monuogan''' (沒諾干), formally '''Prince Zhonglie of Langye''' (琅邪忠烈王), was a general of the [[History of China|Chinese]] dynasty [[Tang Dynasty]], serving as a long-time ''[[Jiedushi]]'' of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]) during the reign of [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] and ruling Chengde in a ''de facto'' independent manner from the imperial regime.

== Background ==
Wang Wujun was born in 735 and originally known as Muonuogan.  He was from Nujie (怒皆) tribe, of [[Khitan people|Khitan]] stock.  His grandfather was named Kenagan (可訥干), and his father was named Luju (路俱).  During [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]]'s ''Kaiyuan'' era (713-741), Luju followed his leader Li Shi (李詩), who took 5,000 households in crossing into Tang borders to submit to Tang.  Emperor Xuanzong praised them and allowed them to live in Ji Prefecture (薊州, in modern [[Tianjin]]).&lt;ref name=BT142&gt;''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a16/142.htm vol. 142].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', a [[Kumo Xi|Xi]] leader named Li Shi submitted to Tang in 732, but it is not clear whether that Li Shi was the same Li Shi whom Luju followed.  See ''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷213|vol. 213]].&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known when Wang Wujun acquired the name of Wujun, but it is known that by age 14, he was known for his horsemanship and archery, and he became as famous as [[Zhang Xiaozhong|Zhang Alao]] (later known as Zhang Xiaozhong) in the region.  Both of them later served the army officer [[Li Baochen|Zhang Zhongzhi]], who in turn served under the general [[An Lushan]], who then controlled the region.&lt;ref name=NBT211&gt;''[[New Book of Tang]]'', [http://www.sidneyluo.net/a/a17/211.htm vol. 211].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service under Li Baochen (Zhang Zhongzhi) ==
In 755, An Lushan [[Anshi Rebellion|rebelled]] against Emperor Xuanzong, and soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of [[Yan (Anshi)|Yan]].&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷217|vol. 217]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Zhang Zhongzhi served as a major general of the Yan state, but by 762, Yan, then with [[Shi Chaoyi]] as its emperor, was nearing final defeat, and Tang forces were entering the heart of its territory north of the [[Yellow River]].  Zhang was then defending Heng Prefecture (恆州, in modern [[Shijiazhuang]], [[Hebei]]), and Wang Wujun persuaded him to submit to Tang.  Zhang agreed and submitted to Tang with the five prefectures that he controlled, and turned against remaining Yan forces.  Emperor Xuanzong's grandson [[Emperor Daizong of Tang|Emperor Daizong]], then emperor of Tang, bestowed the imperial surname of [[Li (李)|Li]] on Zhang, and Zhang thereafter became known as Li Baochen.  Li Baochen was allowed to retain control over the territory he had, which was organized into Chengde Circuit, with Li Baochen as its military governor (''[[Jiedushi]]'').  As Wang contributed in the subsequent campaign that cleared the territory, he was created the Prince of Weichuan.&lt;ref name=NBT211/&gt;

As Li Baochen grew old and intended to pass the territory to his son [[Li Weiyue]], he began killing a number of officers that he feared Li Weiyue could not control.  However, as he took a great liking to Wang's son [[Wang Shizhen (Tang Dynasty)|Wang Shizhen]] and gave Wang Shizhen his daughter in marriage, and Wang Shizhen subsequently gained Li Baochen's trust as well as insider information at LI Baochen's headquarters, Wang Wujun escaped the fate of many of his colleagues.&lt;ref name=NBT211/&gt;

== Service under Li Weiyue ==
Meanwhile, Li Baochen had also been in alliance with several other military governors who were also ruling their circuits independently from the imperial regime and intending to pass their realms to their descendants — [[Li Zhengji]] the military governor of Pinglu Circuit (平盧, headquartered in modern [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]), [[Tian Chengsi]] the military governor of Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern [[Handan]], [[Hebei]]), and [[Liang Chongyi]] the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern [[Xiangfan]], [[Hubei]]).  When Li Baochen and Li Zhengji, in succession, died in 781, then-emperor [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] (Emperor Daizong's son), wanting to break up the warlords' power, refused to let Li Weiyue and Li Zhengji's son [[Li Na (Tang Dynasty)|Li Na]] inherit their fathers' positions.  Li Weiyue, Li Na, Tian Chengsi's nephew and successor [[Tian Yue]], and Liang thus prepared for war against the imperial regime.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷226|vol. 226]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Liang was quickly defeated by [[Li Xilie]] and committed suicide, while imperial forces inflicted serious damage on Tian's and Li Na's forces.  Meanwhile, [[Zhu Tao]] the acting military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern [[Beijing]]) attacked Li Weiyue from the north and was quickly able to persuade two key Chengde officers, Zhang Xiaozhong the prefect of Yi Prefecture (易州, in modern Shijiazhuang) and Kang Rizhi (康日知) the prefect of Zhao Prefecture (趙州, in modern Shijiazhuang), to submit their respective prefectures turn against Li Weiyue.  When Li Weiyue tried to counterattack in spring 782, Zhu and Zhang's joint forces defeated him at Shulu (束鹿, in modern Shijiazhuang), forcing him to flee back to Chengde's capital Heng Prefecture.  It was said that during the Battle of Shulu, Wang Wujun, serving as Li Weiyue's forward commander and believing that Li Weiyue was already suspicious of him, decided not to fight to the best of his ability, and that this led to the defeat.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ227&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷227|vol. 227]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the defeat, Li Weiyue was even more suspicious of Wang, but his advisors pointed out that there was no one other than Wang who would be capable to command the army.  Li Weiyue thus commissioned Wang, assisted by Wei Changning (衛常寧), to attack Zhao Prefecture, and put Wang Shizhen in charge of security at headquarters.  Wang Wujun was relieved to get to leave Heng Prefecture, and once he exited the city, initially wanted to flee to Zhang.  Wei pointed out that Emperor Dezong had issued an edict promising to give the offices that Li Weiyue wanted to whoever would cut off Li Weiyue's head and advocated for an attack on Li Weiyue.  Wang Wujun thus notified Wang Shizhen and involved Li Weiyue's close associate Xie Zun (謝遵) in the plot at well.  He made a surprise attack against Heng Prefecture, and Wang Shizhen and Xie opened the city gates to welcome him.  Wang Wujun killed Li Weiyue and his associates and surrendered to the imperial government.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ227/&gt;

== Rebellion against Emperor Dezong ==
Emperor Dezong, in the aftermaths, divided Chengde's seven prefectures into three smaller circuits — with Zhang Xiaozhong receiving three prefectures and the title of military governor of the newly created Yidingcang Circuit (易定滄, headquartered in modern [[Baoding]], [[Hebei]], later renamed Yiwu Circuit (義武)), while Wang Wujun and Kang Rizhi received two prefectures each with lesser titles of military prefect (團練使, ''Tuanlianshi''), of Hengji (恆冀) and Shenzhao (深趙, both headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang).  This displeased both Zhu Tao and Wang — as Zhu had wanted Emperor Dezong to give him Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern [[Hengshui]], [[Hebei]]), which went to Kang instead (Emperor Dezong gave Zhu two prefectures on paper,  De (德州, in modern [[Dezhou]], [[Shandong]]) and Di (棣州, in modern [[Binzhou]], [[Shandong]]), both then still held by Li Na, and Wang believed that Emperor Dezong had reneged on the promise to reward him with the positions that Li Weiyue had wanted.  He was further fearful when he received orders to provide Zhu's army with food and [[Ma Sui]]'s army (which was then attacking Tian Yue) with horses, believing that Emperor Dezong might be using those orders to divert his power and getting ready to attack him next.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ227/&gt;

Tian, hearing of Zhu's disaffection, sent emissaries to Zhu to persuade him to turn against the imperial forces and aid him.  Zhu agreed, and in turn sent emissaries to Wang, persuading him to join the alliance as well and agreeing to give him Shen Prefecture, which Zhu occupied at the time.  Wang was pleased, and agreed to join him and Tian.  (Zhu also tried to persuade Zhang to join the alliance, but Zhang refused.)  When Emperor Dezong sent emissaries to order Zhu and Wang to advance south against Tian, Wang arrested the imperial emissaries and delivered them to Zhu, thus openly turning against imperial authority.  Zhu, as promised, transferred control of Shen Prefecture to Wang, while sending forces to join Wang's in sieging Kang at Zhao Prefecture.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ227/&gt;

However, by this point, Tian was in desperate straits under siege from imperial forces commanded by Ma, [[Li Baozhen]], and Li Qiu (李艽) at his capital Wei Prefecture (魏州).  Zhu and Wang thus advanced south to relieve him, and as they arrived, so did additional imperial forces commanded by [[Li Huaiguang]].  Against Ma's advice of waiting until his soldiers had enough rest, Li Huaiguang decided to battle Zhu and Wang immediately.  He had initial successes, but Wang cut his soldiers off from each other with a charge, leading to a major defeat for the imperial forces.  Zhu and Wang then tried to cut off the imperial troops escape, but Ma then promised to request that Emperor Dezong put Zhu in charge of the entire region north of the Yellow River.  Despite Wang's stern opposition, Zhu believed him and did not pursue imperial forces further, so the imperial forces were able to withdraw over a river from Wei Prefecture, and were able to take up a posture against the rebel forces, thus putting the armies into a stalemate.  Zhu, seeing that he had been tricked by Ma, apologized to Wang, but Wang, while accepting the apology, thereafter resented Zhu.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ227/&gt;

In the aftermaths of the imperial forces' defeat, Tian was grateful to Zhu, and offered to subjugate himself and Wang to Zhu — in effect, offering the emperor title to Zhu.  Zhu declined, crediting Wang rather than himself for the victory.  At the suggestion of Zhu's staff member Li Ziqian (李子千) and Wang's staff member Zheng Ru (鄭濡), they decided to each claim a princely title to show independence from imperial authority, but keep Tang's [[era name]] in order not to completely break from Tang.  On December 9, 782,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&amp;dyna=%AD%F0&amp;king=%BCw%A9v&amp;reign=%AB%D8%A4%A4&amp;yy=3&amp;ycanzi=&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=1&amp;dcanzi=&lt;/ref&gt; in an elaborate ceremony, Zhu claimed the title of Prince of Ji; Wang claimed the title of Prince of Zhao; Tian claimed the title of Prince of Wei; and they issued a letter offering Li Na the title of Prince of Qi.  They also established administrations with governmental structures paralleling the Tang imperial government to further show independence, although the titles were intentionally different from Tang's to show some subordination.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ227/&gt;

== As self-proclaimed Prince of Zhao ==
Meanwhile, though, as Zhu Tao's and Wang Wujun's troops were continuing to battle Tang imperial troops on Tian Yue's soil, all three of them were becoming financially drained.  They pinned their hopes on alliance with Li Xilie, who had even greater pretensions, who was then ruling Huaixi Circuit (淮西, headquartered in modern [[Xuchang]], [[Henan]]), which was then wealthy.  They, along with Li Na, thus sent emissaries to Huaixi, suggesting to Li Xilie that he take imperial title.  Li Xilie did not do so immediately, but began to claim titles greater than the ones bestowed him by Emperor Dezong.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ228&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷228|vol. 228]].&lt;/ref&gt;  (Li Xilie would eventually declare himself to be the emperor of a new state of Chu in spring 784, although without further pledge of allegiance by the four.)&lt;ref name=ZZTJ229&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷229|vol. 229]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in summer 783, an incident would occur to further to erode the alliance between Zhu and Wang.  The imperial general [[Li Sheng (Tang dynasty)|Li Sheng]] had wanted to cut off the supply lines between Lulong and Weibo by capturing Lulong's Zhuo (涿州, in modern Baoding) and Mo (莫州, in modern Cangzhou) Prefectures, and therefore joined forces with Zhang Xiaozhong's son Zhang Shengyun (張昇雲) in sieging Zhu's general Zhang Jingji (鄭景濟) at Qingwan (清苑, in modern Baoding).  Zhu left his general Ma Shi (馬寔) at Weibo and personally relieved Qingwan, defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun and forcing them to withdraw back to Yi Prefecture, under Zhang Xiaozhong's control.  Upon defeating Li Sheng and Zhang Shengyun, however, Zhu did not immediately return to Weibo, and Wang sent his subordinate Song Duan (宋端) to Zhu, urging him to return to Weibo as soon as possible.  When Song met Zhu, Song was harsh in his words, and Zhu threw a fit of anger—causing Wang to be fearful and to apologize to Ma in person.  Zhu's angers subsided, and it was said that he continued to treat Wang as an ally, but that Wang's secret resentment toward Zhu grew even more.  Wang subsequently responded to an overture by Li Baozhen into forming a secret alliance, although he also continued in alliance with Zhu, Tian, and Li Na.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ228/&gt;

In fall 783, soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern [[Pingliang]], [[Gansu]]), then at Chang'an in preparation for deployment to the Weibo front, were angry that they were not given sufficient rewards, and they mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]]).  The mutineers supported Zhu Tao's brother [[Zhu Ci]] — who had previously served as a major imperial general but who been forced into retirement after Zhu Tao turned against the imperial government — as their leader.  Zhu Ci subsequently declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin, and he created Zhu Tao [[crown prince]].  Zhu Tao, upon receiving the communique from Zhu Ci, immediately spread the news to the other circuits in hopes that they would declare for Zhu Ci as well.  Upon news of Emperor Dezong's flight to Fengtian arriving at the imperial camp at Weibo, the imperial troops scattered, with Li Huaiguang heading for Fengtian to aid Emperor Dezong, and Ma Sui, Li Baozhen, and Li Qiu returning to their respective circuits.  Upon the imperial troops' withdrawal, Zhu Tao and Wang also withdrew to their own circuits.  Meanwhile, Zhu Tao, who had earlier married a daughter of a [[Huige]] khan, requested aid from Huige.  Huige sent 3,000 soldiers to aid Zhu Tao in his efforts to further advance south to capture the eastern capital [[Luoyang]].  However, by this point, Li Baozhen had persuaded Wang to turn against Zhu Tao — pointing out that if Zhu Tao and Zhu Ci were successful together, Wang would be under their control and further that Zhu's title of Prince of Ji showed implicit ambition to possess Wang's Ji Prefecture (冀州, in modern Hengshui).  Emperor Dezong also sent messengers to Tian and Li Na, urging them to turn against Zhu Tao as well, and when Emperor Dezong declared a general pardon in spring 784 — the scope of which included even Zhu Tao, Wang, Tian, Li Na, and Li Xilie and implicitly promising them that if they submitted to nominal imperial authority again, he would not dare to interfere with them again — Wang, Tian, and Li Na all renounced their self-claimed royal titles.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ229/&gt;

== Resubmission to Emperor Dezong ==
As a result of Wang Wujun's removal of his own royal title, Emperor Dezong recommissioned him as the military governor of Chengde Circuit — adding Kang Rizhi's two prefectures to his territory, although not Zhang Xiaozhong's three prefectures.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ229/&gt;  He also soon made Wang the military governor of Lulong Circuit as well, intending to use Wang's ambitions against Zhu Tao.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ230&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷230|vol. 230]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Emperor Dezong also made Wang an honorary [[chancellor of Tang Dynasty|chancellor]] with the designation ''Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi'' (同中書門下平章事), made him ''Sikong'' (司空, one of the [[Three Excellencies]]), and created him the Prince of Langye.&lt;ref name=BT142/&gt;  However, Zhu, unaware of this development, began his plan of march toward Luoyang in early 784.  He went through Chengde and Weibo with great ceremonies of welcome from Wang and Tian Yue.  Eventually, when Zhu reached Yongji (永濟, in modern Handan) and requested that Tian join him in advancing to Luoyang, Tian refused.  This drew Zhu's anger, and he divided his troops, along with Huige troops, in attacking several different Weibo cities.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ229/&gt;  Tian put up his defense at Wei Prefecture, waiting for aid; while he was doing so, he was assassinated and succeeded by his cousin [[Tian Xu (Tang Dynasty)|Tian Xu]] (Tian Chengsi's son), and while Zhu rejoiced at the news and Tian Xu initially made overtures to Zhu, Tian Xu eventually continued Tian Yue's policies, continuing to be allied with imperial forces under Li Baozhen and Ma Sui.  Zhu thus continued to siege two primary cities of Weibo — with Zhu himself sieging Bei Prefecture (貝州, in modern [[Xingtai]], [[Hebei]]), defended by the Weibo general Xing Caojun (邢曹俊), and Ma Shi sieging Wei Prefecture, but could not capture either.  Meanwhile, Li Baozhen and Wang had joined their forces and advanced into Weibo territory.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ230/&gt;  Hearing the news, Ma Shi lifted the siege on Bei Prefecture and joined forces with Zhu.  When Zhu prepared to battle Wang and Li Baozhen the next day, Ma Shi, citing the fact that his soldiers at just travelled a substantial distance, requested a few days of rest.  However, the Huige general assisting Zhu, as well as Yang Bu (楊布) and Cai Xiong, advocated for immediate attack.  The next day, May 29, 784,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&amp;dyna=%AD%F0&amp;king=%BCw%A9v&amp;reign=%BF%B3%A4%B8&amp;yy=1&amp;ycanzi=&amp;mm=5&amp;dd=6&amp;dcanzi=&lt;/ref&gt; the armies battled, and the overly confident Zhu was defeated by Wang's and Li Baozhen's forces.  Over 10,000 of his 30,000 soldiers were killed, and over 10,000 deserted.  Zhu, with a few thousand remaining soldiers, feared annihilation at Wang's and Li Baozhen's hands and fled to De Prefecture.  Wang and Li Baozhen were unable to give chase because of dense fog.  After defeating Zhu, Wang returned to Heng Prefecture and declined the additional title of military governor of Lulong, and Emperor Dezong agreed.  Soon, with Wang continuing to attack Zhu, Zhu resubmitted to Tang authority as well.&lt;ref name=ZZTJ231&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷231|vol. 231]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in the aftermaths of Wang's and Li Baozhen's victory over Zhu, De and Di Prefectures, which Zhu had taken over, surrendered to Wang and were incorporated into Chengde, formally under the command of Wang's son Wang Shizhen.&lt;ref name=BT142/&gt;  By 790, however, Zhao Gao (趙鎬) the prefect of Di Prefecture had offended Wang and was refusing Wang's summons.  Meanwhile, there were rumors that Li Na, whom Tian Xu's older brother Tian Chao (田朝) served under as prefect of Qi Prefecture (齊州, in modern [[Ji'nan]], [[Shandong]]), was planning to escort Tian Chao back to Weibo to vie for control of Weibo Circuit.  Tian Xu feared this, and, under suggestion by his staff member Sun Guangzuo (孫光佐), he sent gifts to Li Na to please him and persuade him to send Tian Chao to Chang'an — and further suggested Li Na to accept Zhao's submission.  Li Na therefore accepted Zhao's surrender and took Di Prefecture, despite Wang's attacks.  Tian further cemented the relationship with Li Na by sending Sun to Pinglu's headquarters at Yun Prefecture (鄆州), announcing an imperial edict (which Tian Xu had forged) declaring Di Prefecture to be part of Pinglu Circuit.  In anger, Wang Wujun sent his son Wang Shiqing (王士清) to attack Weibo's Bei Prefecture (貝州, in modern [[Xingtai]], [[Hebei]]), occupying four counties of Bei Prefecture.  In winter 790, Emperor Dezong, wanting to put an end to the campaigns between these circuits, ordered Li Na to return Di Prefecture to Chengde; Li Na demanded that Wang return the four counties of Bei Prefecture to Weibo first.  Wang did so, and subsequently, Li Na returned Di Prefecture to Chengde.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷233|vol. 233]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 792, Li Na died, and his son [[Li Shigu]] succeeded him.  Wang Wujun felt that he could take advantage of Li Shigu's youth, and therefore sent an army to De and Di Prefectures, readying an attack on two Pinglu forts — Geduo&lt;ref&gt;The character for Duo is not in [[Unicode]].&lt;/ref&gt; (in modern Binzhou) and Sancha (三汊).  Li Shigu sent Zhao to defend against the expected attack.  Emperor Dezong sent [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] to order them to stop fighting, and thereafter Wang withdrew.  Meanwhile, in 793, after an incident when Zhang Xiaozhong's son Zhang Shenglin (張昇璘), whose older brother Zhang Shengyun (張昇雲) had succeeded their father Zhang Xiaozhong as military governor of Yiwu in 791 after Zhang Xiaozhong's death and who was also a son-in-law of Li Na's, publicly cursed Wang, Wang submitted an accusation against Zhang Shenglin for disrespect.  Emperor Dezong ordered that Zhang Shenglin be removed from his office as military prefect of Hai Prefecture (海州, in modern [[Lianyungang]], [[Jiangsu]]) and detained.  However, Wang used this excuse to attack Yiwu, capturing Yifeng (義豐, in modern Baoding) and seizing 10,000 people.  Only after repeated apologies by Zhang Shengyun did Wang withdraw.&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷234|vol. 234]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 794, when Li Baozhen died, his son Li Jian (李緘) tried to take control of his Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern [[Changzhi]], [[Shanxi]]) and sought material aid (in forms of a loan) from Wang.  Wang firmly rebuked him, and subsequently, without support from neighboring circuits or Zhaoyi's own officers, Li Jian gave up his attempt to seize the circuit.  In 796, Emperor Dezong bestowed on Wang the greater honorary chancellor title of ''Zhongshu Ling'' (中書令).&lt;ref&gt;''Zizhi Tongjian'', [[:zh:s:資治通鑑/卷235|vol. 235]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Wang died in 801 and was posthumously honored with the same ceremony that had been used for the great general [[Hun Jian]].  Wang Shizhen succeeded him.&lt;ref name=BT142/&gt;

"...the assassination of Lord Mountbatten at his holiday home at southern Ireland on 27 March 1979, the same day that another IRA unit ambushed and blew up eighteen British soldiers at Warrenpoint in a more conventional guerrilla operation."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Irish War: The Hidden Conflict Between the IRA and British Intelligence|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|publisher=JHU Press|year=1998|isbn=0801864569|location=|pages=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) on 27 August 1979. The IRA's [[South Armagh Brigade]] ambushed the [[British Army]] with two large roadside bombs at [[Narrow Water Castle]] (near [[Warrenpoint]]) in [[Northern Ireland]]. The first bomb was aimed at a British Army convoy and the second targeted the reinforcements sent to deal with the incident. IRA volunteers hidden in nearby woodland also allegedly fired on the troops. The castle is on the banks of the [[Newry River]], which marks [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|the border]] between Northern Ireland and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

Eighteen British soldiers were killed and six were seriously injured, making it the deadliest attack on the British Army during [[the Troubles]]. An English civilian was also killed and another injured when British soldiers fired across the border after the first blast. The attack happened on the same day that the IRA assassinated [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|The 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma]].

== Ambush ==

=== First explosion ===
At 16:40, a British Army convoy consisting of one [[Land Rover]] and two four-ton lorries was driving past [[Narrow Water Castle]] on the [[A2 road (Northern Ireland)|A2 road]]. As it passed, a {{Convert|500|lb|kg|0|adj=on}} [[ANFO|fertiliser bomb]], hidden in a lorry loaded with [[strawbale]]s and parked near the castle, was detonated by remote control. The explosion caught the last lorry in the convoy, hurling it on its side and instantly killing six members of [[2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment]], whose bodies were scattered across the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harnden | first = Toby | authorlink = Toby Harnden | title = Bandit Country | publisher = [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] | year = 1999| month = | isbn = 0-340-71736-X | page = 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only two survivors amongst the soldiers travelling in the lorry; they both received serious injuries. Anthony Wood (19), the lorry's driver, was one of those killed. All that remained of Wood's body was his pelvis, which had been welded to the seat by the fierce heat of the blast.&lt;ref name="jackson"/&gt;

Immediately after the blast, the soldiers said they were targeted by sniper fire, coming from woods on the other side of [[Irish border|the border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Taylor (journalist) | title = Behind the mask:The IRA and Sinn Féin| publisher = TV books | year = 1997| month = | isbn = 1-57500-061-X | page = 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lostlives799/&gt; Two uninvolved civilians—William Hudson, a 29-year-old from [[London]], and his cousin Barry Hudson, from [[Dingle]]—went to the shore on the Republic's side of the border to see what was happening. The pair were partners in Hudson Amusements and had been running their [[Traveling carnival|funfair]] in [[Omeath]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/saw-his-cousin-shot-on-the-day-of-the-narrow-water-bomb-26937022.html|title=Saw his cousin shot on the day of the Narrow Water bomb|author=|date=2 September 2009|publisher=[[The Argus (Dundalk)|The Argus]]|accessdate=27 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers fired across the water at them, killing William and wounding Barry.&lt;ref name=lostlives799&gt;McKittrick, David. ''Lost Lives: The stories of the men, women, and children who died as a result of the Northern Ireland Troubles''. Mainstream, 1999. p. 799&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) researchers, the soldiers may have mistaken the sound of ammunition [[cooking off]] for enemy gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; However, two IRA members arrested by the [[Gardaí]] and suspected of being behind the ambush, Brendan Burns and Joe Brennan, had traces of gunsmoke residue on their hands and the motorbike they were riding on.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

On hearing the first explosion a [[Royal Marine]] unit alerted the British Army and reinforcements from other units of the Parachute Regiment were dispatched to the scene by road. A [[Rapid reaction force|rapid reaction unit]], consisting of medical staff and senior commander Lieutenant-Colonel David Blair (the commanding officer of the [[Queen's Own Highlanders]]), together with his signaller Lance Corporal Victor MacLeod, were sent by [[Aérospatiale Gazelle|Gazelle]] helicopter; another helicopter, a [[Westland Wessex|Wessex]], landed to pick up the wounded. Colonel Blair assumed command once at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[[J Bowyer Bell]] (1997). ''The secret army: the IRA''. Transaction Publishers, p. 454. {{ISBN|0-8156-0597-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second explosion ===
The IRA had been studying how the British Army behaved after a bombing and correctly predicted that they would set up an incident command point (ICP) in the gatehouse on the opposite side of the road. At 17:12, thirty-two minutes after the first explosion, an {{convert|800|lb|kg|0|adj=on}} bomb hidden in milk pails exploded against the gatehouse, destroying it and hurling lumps of granite through the air. It detonated as the Wessex helicopter was taking off carrying wounded soldiers. The helicopter was damaged by the blast but did not crash.&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, p.796&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Narrow Water Tower - geograph.org.uk - 494487.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Narrow Water Castle]]
The second explosion killed twelve soldiers: ten from the Parachute Regiment and the two from the Queen's Own Highlanders.&lt;ref name=cain&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1979.html Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland: 1979] — [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p.199&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Jackson (British Army officer)|Mike Jackson]], then a major in the Parachute Regiment, was at the scene soon after the second explosion and later described seeing body parts scattered over the road, in the water and hanging from the trees. He was asked to identify the face of his friend, Major Peter Fursman, still recognisable after it had been completely ripped from his head by the explosion and recovered from the water by divers from the [[Royal Engineers]]. Only one of Colonel Blair's [[epaulette]]s remained to identify him as his body had been vaporised in the blast.&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite news

Press photographer Peter Molloy, who arrived at the scene after the first explosion, came close to being shot by an angry paratrooper who saw him taking photographs of the dead and dying instead of offering to help the wounded. The soldier was tackled by his comrades. Molloy said, "I was shouted at and called all sorts of things but I understood why. I had trespassed on the worst day of these fellas' lives and taken pictures of it."&lt;ref name="mirror"&gt;"These are the last pictures I ever took...

Jilly Beattie. 17 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The Warrenpoint ambush was a propaganda victory for the IRA. It was the deadliest attack on the British Army during the Troubles and the Parachute Regiment's biggest loss since World War II, with sixteen paratroopers killed. The 1st battalion of the Parachute Regiment was responsible for [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] on 30 January 1972 where 14 unarmed protesters were shot dead. The IRA made clear it was targeting British paratroopers because of Bloody Sunday. General [[James Glover (British Army officer)|Sir James Glover]], Commander of British forces in Northern Ireland, said it was "arguably the most successful and certainly one of the best planned IRA attacks of the whole campaign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/northern_ireland/2000/brits/transcript2.stm "Shoot to Kill" – Transcript]. BBC. Retrieved 20 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambush happened on the same day that [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], a prominent member of the [[British Royal Family]], was killed by an IRA bomb aboard his boat at [[Mullaghmore, County Sligo|Mullaghmore]], along with three others.

Shortly after the Warrenpoint ambush, IRA volunteers Brendan Burns and Joe Brennan were arrested by Gardaí (the Irish police). They were stopped while riding a motorbike on a road opposite Narrow Water Castle. They were later released on bail due to lack of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the Mountbatten and Warrenpoint attacks, the [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) retaliated by shooting dead a Catholic man, John Patrick Hardy (43), at his home in Belfast's New Lodge estate. Hardy was targeted in the mistaken belief that he was an IRA member.&lt;ref name="taylor163"&gt;Taylor, Peter (1999). ''Loyalists''. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. pp. 163–164&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Toby Harnden]], the attack "drove a wedge" between the Army and the RUC. Lieutenant-General Sir [[Timothy Creasey]], [[General Officer Commanding]] Northern Ireland, suggested to [[Margaret Thatcher]] that [[internment]] should be brought back and that liaison with the Gardaí should be left in the hands of the military.&lt;ref&gt;Harnden, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Kenneth Newman, the RUC Chief Constable, claimed instead that the British Army practice, already in place since 1975, of supplying their garrisons in South [[County Armagh]] by helicopter, gave too much freedom of movement to the IRA.&lt;ref&gt;"But Sir [[Kenneth Newman]], the RUC Chief Constable, was adamant that the policy of 'police primacy', introduced by [[Merlyn Rees]] should be remain in all areas, including South Armagh. The Army's decision not to travel by road in South Armagh was wrong, he argued, because it gave the IRA too much freedom." Harnden, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Since the mid-1970s virtually all military movement has been by helicopter to avoid casualties from landmines planted under the roads; even the rubbish from the security forces bases is taken away by air." Harnden, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; One tangible security outcome was the appointment of Sir [[Maurice Oldfield]] to a new position of Co-ordinator of Security Intelligence in Northern Ireland. His role was to co-ordinate intelligence between the military, MI5 and the RUC. The other was the expansion of the RUC by 1,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, Paul (2000). [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/arthur00.htm ''Special Relationships: Britain, Ireland and the Northern Ireland problem'']. Blackstaff Press, Chapter 8. {{ISBN|0-85640-688-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tim Pat Coogan]] asserts that ultimately, the death of these 18 soldiers hastened the move to [[Ulsterisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coogan | first = Tim Pat |authorlink = Tim Pat Coogan | title = The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal, 1966–1995, and the Search for Peace |publisher = Hutchinson | year = 1995| month = | isbn = 0-09-179146-4 | page = 245 | quote = "From the time of the Ulsterisation, normalisation and criminalisation policy formulations in the mid-seventies it had become obvious that, if the conflict was to be Vietnamised and the natives were to do the fighting, then the much-talked-about 'primacy of the police' would have to become a reality. The policy was officially instituted in 1976. But if one had to point to a watershed date as a result of which the police actually wrested real power from the army I would select 27 August 1979."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant-Colonel Blair is remembered on a memorial at [[Radley School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radley.org.uk/OR/Lusimus/Lus16/Lusimus%20Jan08.pdf Lusimus magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722202634/http://www.radley.org.uk/OR/Lusimus/Lus16/Lusimus%20Jan08.pdf |date=22 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burns was killed in 1988 when a bomb he was transporting exploded prematurely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1988.html Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland: 1988] — [[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] (CAIN)&lt;/ref&gt;  Brennan was jailed in 1996 on explosives charges not related to Warrenpoint. He was released under the [[Good Friday Agreement]].

'''Æthelweard''' (also '''Ethelward'''; d. [[Circa|c.]] 998), descended from the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] King [[Æthelred of Wessex|Æthelred I]] of [[Wessex]], the elder brother of [[Alfred the Great]], was an [[ealdorman]] and the author of a [[Latin]] version of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' known as the ''[[Chronicon Æthelweardi]]''.

==Career==
Æthelweard first witnessed charters as a [[thegn]] after the accession of [[Eadwig]] in 955, probably because he was the brother of the king's wife, [[Ælfgifu, wife of Eadwig|Ælfgifu]], although the relationship is unproven. The marriage was annulled on the grounds of consanguinity, and Æthelweard's position was threatened when Eadwig died in 959 and was succeeded by his half-brother [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]], who was hostile to the faction associated with Eadwig. Æthelweard survived, although he was not appointed to the position of [[ealdorman]] until after Edgar's death. In the view of Shashi Jayakumar, "One receives the impression that Æthelweard played his cards right in Edgar's reign, perhaps by treading warily and displaying the same maddening discretion that one finds in his ''Chronicon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Shashi|last=Jayakumar|year=2008|title=Edgar, King of the English 959-975|chapter=Eadwid and Edgar: Politics, Propaganda, Faction|editor-first=Donald|editor-last=Scragg|publisher=The Boydell Press|location=Woodbridge, UK|isbn=978 1 84383 928 6|pages=87–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Æthelweard signed as ''dux'' or ''ealdorman'' in 973, and was accorded primacy among the ealdormen after 993. He continued to witness until 998, about which time his death may have taken place. Æthelweard's ealdormanry was the Western Provinces, probably the south-west peninsula. His brother Ælfweard, a royal ''discthegn'', or household official, continued to sign as ''minister'' until 986.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Simon. ''The Diplomas of King Æthelred the Unready 978–1016'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

In 991 Æthelweard was associated with [[archbishop of Canterbury|archbishop]] [[Sigeric the Serious|Sigeric]] in the conclusion of a peace with the victorious Danes from [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and in 994 he was sent with Bishop [[Alphege|Ælfheah]] of Winchester to make peace with [[Olaf I of Norway|Olaf Tryggvason]] at [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]].&lt;ref name="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"&gt;[http://omacl.org/Anglo/part3.html Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]&lt;/ref&gt;

Æthelweard was the friend and patron of [[Ælfric of Eynsham]], who in the preface to his Old English ''Lives'' of saints, addressed Æthelweard and his son Æthelmær.

==Family==
In the introduction to his Latin Chronicle Æthelweard claims to descend from King Æthelred,&lt;ref&gt;Antonia Gransden, ''Historical Writing in England: c. 500 to c. 1307'', 1993, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Book IV he calls Æthelred his ''atavus'', then uses the same term to describe the relationship between the chronicle's recipient, [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen]], and her great-great-grandfather, King Alfred.&lt;ref name="Anscombe"&gt;Alfred Anscombe, "The Pedigree of Earl Godwine" in ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', 1913, 3rd Series, vol. 7, pp. 129-150&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Patrick Wormald]], Æthelweard may have meant that Æthelred was his great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather, great-great-great-grandfather, or merely ancestor,&lt;ref name=wormald&gt;Wormald, Æthelweard&lt;/ref&gt; but Sean Miller specifies great-great-grandfather.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; In 957 King Eadwig, the great-grandson of King Æthelred I's brother, Alfred the Great, was obliged to divorce Æthelweard's likely sister Ælfgifu on the grounds of consanguinity.&lt;ref name="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"/&gt;

It has been postulated that Æthelweard and his siblings Ælfweard, Ælfgifu and Ælfwaru were the children of Eadric, ealdorman of Hampshire. This identification rests on Ælfgifu's possession of the estate of [[Princes Risborough|Risborough]], which had belonged to Eadric's mother, Æthelgyth, the wife of ealdorman [[Æthelfrith of Mercia]].

One possible construction is that his putative grandfather Æthelfrith was the grandson of King Æthelred I through his son [[Æthelhelm]].&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, Lundie W. "The Antecedents of Earl Godwine of Wessex" in ''New England Historical and Genealogical Register'', 1957, vol. 111, pp. 30-38&lt;/ref&gt; This royal connection would go some way to explaining the enormous prestige enjoyed by Æthelfrith's sons.

Assuming that the identification of Æthelweard as the brother of  Ælfgifu is correct, his mother was the Æthelgifu whose company Eadwig enjoyed along with her daughter whilst escaping his coronation. Ælfgifu left a bequest to an Æthelflaed, who was either Æthelweard's wife or his sister-in-law.

Æthelweard was father of [[Æthelmær the Stout]], who was ealdorman of the Western provinces towards the end of Æthelred II's reign. Æthelmær was the father of [[Æthelnoth (archbishop of Canterbury)|Æthelnoth]], who became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1020, and was later regarded as a saint,&lt;ref name="DNBÆthelnoth"&gt;Mason, Emma "Æthelnoth (d. 1038)" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8912 Online Edition] accessed 7 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Æthelweard executed by King [[Cnut]] in 1017.&lt;ref name="Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"/&gt; Æthelmær has been speculatively identified with the Agelmær named by [[John of Worcester]] as brother of [[Eadric Streona]] and father of [[Wulfnoth Cild]], who was father of [[Godwin, Earl of Wessex]] and grandfather of King [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]], though the Worcester chronicler makes this Agelmær son of Agelric rather than Æthelweard and the pedigree as a whole has problematic chronology.&lt;ref name="Anscombe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David H. Kelley, "The House of Aethelred", in Lindsay L. Brook, ed., ''Studies in Genealogy and Family History in Tribute to Charles Evans...'' 1989, pp. 63-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
After 975 and probably before 983, Æthelweard wrote the ''Chronicon'', a Latin translation of a lost version of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', including material not found in surviving Old English versions.&lt;ref name=miller&gt;Miller, Sean, "Æthelweard" in ''The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England'', ed. [[Michael Lapidge]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Æthelweard wrote his work at the request of his relative [[Mathilde, Abbess of Essen|Mathilde]], abbess of the [[Essen Abbey]] and granddaughter of emperor [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] and [[Eadgyth]] of Wessex. The text only survives in a single copy now in the [[British Library]],&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicon de Rebus Anglicis'', BL Cotton MS, Otho A.x&lt;/ref&gt; which was badly damaged in the [[Cotton library#The Ashburnham House Fire|Cotton Library fire]] in 1731, but it had been printed by [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Henry Savile]] in 1596.&lt;ref name=wormald/&gt; Mathilde probably rewarded him with a copy of [[Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]]' work ''[[De Re Militari]]'' which was written in [[Essen]] and has long been in England.

The ''Chronicon'' was composed in the ''hermeneutic'' style almost universally adopted by English scholars writing in Latin in the tenth century. [[Michael Lapidge]] defines it as "a style whose most striking feature is the ostentatious parade of unusual, often very arcane and apparently learned vocabulary."&lt;ref&gt;Lapidge, pp. 105, 135–136, 139&lt;/ref&gt; The twelfth century historian [[William of Malmesbury]], writing at a time when the style had come to be seen as barbarous, described him as "... a noble and illustrious character, who attempted to arrange these chronicles in Latin, and whose intention I could applaud, if his language did not disgust me it would be better to be silent".
