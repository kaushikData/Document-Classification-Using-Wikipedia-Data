'''ACC Asian XI cricket team''' was a team that took part in [[World Cricket Tsunami Appeal]] and [[Afro-Asia Cup]]. The ACC Asian XI played their first in a one-off match the 2005 [[World Cricket Tsunami Appeal]] which was designed to raise funds for charities following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and resulting tsunami. As of now, Asia XI had played 7 matches played, the Asian XI have won 4 of them.

The team also competed in an [[Afro-Asia Cup]] against an [[African XI cricket team|Africa XI]] which was designed as a fund-raiser for the [[African Cricket Association]] and the [[Asian Cricket Council]]. The Afro-Asian Cup debuted in 2005 and the second tournament was played in 2007.

== History ==

=== Tsunami Appeal Match ===

Their first match resulted in a heavy 112 run loss to the World XI in the Tsunami Appeal match at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Travelex sponsored the first match, which was a 78,000 sell-out, for A$1 million. Two C-130H Hercules aircraft, similar to those used by the Royal Australian Air Force to carry supplies to regions devastated by the massive earthquake and resulting tsunamis, flew over the MCG during the break between innings.

The first ODI, which the World XI won by 112 runs, raised approximately A$17 million, while original estimations suggested only A$5 million would be raised from the Australians. The games were designated as One Day Internationals by the ICC, the first time a game between teams not representing separate cricketing nations was so designated. This designation attracted criticism from cricket statisticians.

=== 2005 Afro-Asia Cup ===

Afro-Asia Cup was an idea to raise money for the [[Asian Cricket Council]] and the [[African Cricket Association]] and the whole venture was given a massive boost when the ICC somewhat controversially agreed to give the series of one-day matches full ODI status.

They went on to lose the opening match of the 2005 Afro-Asian Cup by two runs to the African XI. They bounced back and won the next match, however, including half centuries for each of the [[Sri Lanka]]n pair [[Kumar Sangakkara]] and [[Mahela Jayawardene]]. During the deciding match, the Asian XI bowled the African XI out for 106, but soon after starting their batting performance rain fell and the game was called off: the trophy was shared.

=== 2007 Afro-Asia Cup ===

In the 2007 competition, the Asian XI recorded a 3–0 [[whitewash (sport)|whitewash]] of the Africans – winning the first two matches by 34 and 31 runs (respectively), the latter helped by [[Dilhara Fernando]] recording ODI career best bowling figures of 4/36.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/11/11122/11122.html | title=Dilhara Fernando player profile | publisher=''CricketArchive'' | accessdate=2007-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final match, the Asians fell to 72/5, but following centuries from [[Mahela Jayawardene]] (107) and [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] (139[[not out|*]]) – the latter being the highest individual score ever recorded in an Afro-Asia Cup match&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/aac2007/engine/records/batting/most_runs_innings.html?id=78;type=trophy |title=Records – Afro-Asia Cup – High scores |publisher=''Cricinfo'' |accessdate=2007-07-08 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; – they posted a score of 331/8. Despite half-centuries from three of the African batsmen, however, the Asian XI won by 13 runs.

[[Mahela Jayawardene]] is the highest run-scorer of the Asian XI in the Afro-Asia Cup, with two half-centuries and a century to his name, second to [[Shaun Pollock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/aac2007/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=78;type=trophy |title=Records – Afro-Asia Cup – Most runs |publisher=''Cricinfo'' |accessdate=2007-07-08 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named [[Man of the Series]] for the 2007 competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|subscription=yes |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/IND/2007_IND_Afro-Asia_Cup_2007.html |title=Afro-Asia Cup 2007 tour homepage |publisher=''CricketArchive'' |accessdate=2007-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819162749/http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/IND/2007_IND_Afro-Asia_Cup_2007.html |archivedate=19 August 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zaheer Khan]] tops the list for most wickets with 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/aac2007/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=78;type=trophy |title=Records – Afro-Asia Cup – Most wickets |publisher=''Cricinfo'' |accessdate=2007-07-08 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aornum''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄορνον}}) was an [[oracle]] in [[Ancient Greece]], located in [[Thesprotia]] in a cave called '''Charonium''' ({{lang|grc|Χαρώνειον ἄντρον or χάσμα}}) which gave forth poisonous vapours.&lt;ref&gt;The Oracles of the Ancient World: A Comprehensive Guide (Duckworth Archaeology) by Trevor Curnow,2004,page 184,"... outside it, to the N, there is a place called Aornum, with a sacred cave called the Charonium which emitted deadly vapours...""&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the cave, "[[Charon (mythology)|Charon]]'s Cave", reflects the belief that it was an entrance for [[Hades]], the Greek [[underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;The Greek Myths (Volume 1) by Robert Graves, 1990),page 112: "... He used the passage which opens at Aornum in Thesprotis and, on his arrival, not only charmed the ferryman Charon..."&lt;/ref&gt; In a version of the myth, [[Orpheus]] travels to Aornum to recover his wife, [[Eurydice]], from Hades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Paus.+9.30.4 Pausanias, Description of Greece,Boeotia9.30.1],[6] Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he came to Aornum in Thesprotis, where of old was an oracle of the dead. He thought, they say, that the soul of Eurydice followed him, but turning round he lost her. The Thracians say that such nightingales as nest on the grave of Orpheus sing more sweetly and louder than others.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Bureau des Longitudes''''' ({{IPA-fr|byʁo de lɔ̃ʒityd}}) is a [[France|French]] scientific institution, founded by decree of 25 June 1795 and charged with the improvement of nautical [[navigation]], [[standardisation]] of [[time]]-keeping, [[geodesy]] and astronomical observation.  During the 19th century, it was responsible for [[Clock signal|synchronizing]] [[clocks]] across the world.  It was headed during this time by [[François Arago]] and [[Henri Poincaré]].  The Bureau now functions as an [[academy]] and still meets monthly to discuss topics related to [[astronomy]].

The Bureau was founded by the [[National Convention]] after it heard a report drawn up jointly by the Committee of Navy, the Committee of Finances and the Committee of State education.  [[Henri Grégoire]] had brought to the attention of the National Convention France's failing maritime power and the naval mastery of [[England]], proposing that improvements in navigation would lay the foundations for a renaissance in naval strength. As a result, the Bureau was established with authority over the [[Paris Observatory]] and all other astronomical establishments throughout France.  The Bureau was charged with taking control of the seas away from the [[England|English]] and improving accuracy when tracking the longitudes of ships through astronomical observations and reliable clocks.

The ten original members of its founding board were:

*Geometers:
**[[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]];
**[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]];
*[[Astronomers]]:
**[[Joseph Jérôme Lefrançais de Lalande]];
**[[Pierre Méchain]];
**[[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre]];
**[[Dominique, comte de Cassini]];
*[[Jean-Charles de Borda]], who carried out work related to the [[mechanics]] of [[fluid]]s and precursor of [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] because of his insights on [[thermodynamics]];
*Jean-Nicolas Buache, [[geographer]];
*[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], celebrated [[navigator]]; and
*Noël Simon Caroché, [[manufacturer]] of [[telescopes]].

By a decree of 30 January 1854, the Bureau's mission was extended to embrace geodesy, time standardisation and astronomical measurements.  This decree granted independence to the [[Paris Observatory]], separating it from the Bureau, and focused the efforts of the Bureau on [[time]] and [[astronomy]].  The Bureau was successful at setting a universal time in Paris via air pulses sent through [[pneumatic tubes]].  It later worked to synchronize time across the [[French colonial empire]] by determining the length of time for a signal to make a round trip to and from a French [[colony]].

The French Bureau of Longitude established a commission in the year 1897 to extend the [[SI|metric system]] to the measurement of [[time]]. They planned to abolish the antiquated division of the day into [[hour]]s, [[minute]]s, and [[second]]s, and replace it by a division into tenths, thousandths, and hundred-thousandths of a [[day]].  This was a revival of a [[dream]] that was in the minds of the creators of the metric system at the time of the [[French Revolution]] a hundred years earlier. Some members of the Bureau of Longitude commission introduced a [[compromise]] proposal, retaining the old-fashioned hour as the basic unit of time and dividing it into hundredths and ten-thousandths. [[Poincaré]] served as secretary of the commission and took its work very seriously, writing several of its reports. He was a fervent believer in a [[physical unit|universal metric system]]. But he lost the battle. The rest of the world outside France gave no support to the commission's proposals, and the French government was not prepared to go it alone. After three years of hard work, the commission was dissolved in 1900.

Since 1970, the board has been constituted with 13 members, 3 nominated by the [[Académie des Sciences]]. Since 1998, practical work has been carried out by the ''Institut de mécanique céleste et de calcul des éphémérides''.

The '''Cincinnati Subway''' is a set of incomplete, derelict [[tunnel]]s and stations for a [[rapid transit]] system beneath the streets of [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]]. Although it is only a little over 2 miles in length, it is the largest abandoned subway tunnel system in the [[United States]]. Construction began in the early 1900s as an upgrade to the [[Streetcars in Cincinnati|Cincinnati streetcar system]], but was abandoned due to escalating costs, the collapse of funding amidst political bickering, and the [[Great Depression]] during the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1928, the construction of the subway system in Cincinnati was indefinitely canceled. There are no plans to revive the project.

==History==
Rapid transit was seen as the solution for downtown congestion during the first quarter of the 20th century. Six million dollars were allocated for the project, but construction was delayed due to [[World War I]]. Unexpected post-war inflation doubled the cost of construction, so the project could not be finished at the original estimated price.

Various attempts to use the subway tunnels for mass transit have been unsuccessful. Political squabbling, the Great Depression, [[World War II]], and the rise in popularity of the [[automobile]] have contributed to the failure of the proposals.&lt;ref name="2003_radel_article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Radel|first=Cliff|title=Life under the city: Subway legend has never left the station|pages=12–27|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=May 24, 2003|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/05/24/loc_radel24.html|accessdate=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, many Cincinnatians are unaware of the tunnels underneath them.&lt;ref name="city_of_cincinnati_the_cincinnati_subway"&gt;{{Cite news|title=City of Cincinnati&amp;nbsp;— The Cincinnati Subway |accessdate=2008-12-07 |url=http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/transeng/pages/-7185-/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430170135/http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/transeng/pages/-7185-/ |archivedate=April 30, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Context===
[[File:Cincinnati-canal-map.png|thumb|Former location of the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] in downtown Cincinnati. ]]
From 1825 to 1920 the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] divided Cincinnati's residential neighborhood of [[Over-the-Rhine]] from the business district of downtown.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref name="April_3_1926_Enquirer"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Body in Charge of Transit System|title=Progress of Work Reviewed|newspaper=Cincinnati Enquirer|pages=14–15|date=April 3, 1926|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The canal was used to transport goods and people from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Ohio River]] and subsequently the [[Mississippi River]] via Cincinnati, until the popularity of railroads caused it to become disused.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=17}} The canal became unprofitable by 1856{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=17}} and was abandoned by the city in 1877.&lt;ref name="2003_radel_article" /&gt;

On September 15, 1883 a weekly Cincinnati magazine called ''The Graphic'' proposed that the "dead old ditch" be used to provide an unobstructed route for a subway system, with a large boulevard above.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=18}} 

In 1888, Cincinnati began adopting electric streetcars{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=18}}, which soon became the main form of public transportation.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=19}} During this period Cincinnati was one of the seven most populous US cities&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|17}}and had a rate of growth and economic importance that was similar to that of [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="2003_radel_article" /&gt; The slow streetcars shared the crowded streets with horse-drawn carriages and people, and collided with the first automobiles on an almost daily basis.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|19}} It was not unusual for trips between downtown and the surrounding suburbs to take 45 minutes to an hour.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|46}} Despite having {{convert|222|mi|km}} of streetcar tracks, the city found itself in a growing traffic nightmare.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Another newspaper, the ''Cincinnati Commercial Tribune'', gave encouraging words to the public and said "We believe that the city we love, our home, is at the turning point, and that with the coming of Rapid Transit we will have the beginning of a Greater, More Prosperous, Healthier and Happier Cincinnati. We believe that a Vote for the Loop is a Vote for the best interests of all of us, and it is with pride that we state that every newspaper in the city is for the Loop, and practically all of the Business organizations as well as the Trades Unions." This helped the project win the fight in the polls when the people of Cincinnati enthusiastically passed bill to start construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/10/12411632/public-transportation-failures-america-cincinnati-subway|title=The secret history of Cincinnati's ghost subway|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planning===
In 1910, [[Henry Thomas Hunt]] spearheaded plans for a new rapid transit system.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=35}} The next year City Council convinced the [[Ohio State Legislature]] to lease the city's portion of the canal for use as a boulevard and subway system.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=17}} The city hired experts that worked on Boston's and Chicago's rapid transit systems to research the best possible implementation for Cincinnati's rapid transit system.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=36}} The result were four "Schemes," or proposed routes. The chosen plan—Scheme IV, modification H—looped around the city hitting the central suburbs of [[St. Bernard, Ohio|St. Bernard]] and [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]], the eastern suburbs of [[Oakley, Ohio|Oakley]] and [[Hyde Park, Ohio|Hyde Park]], and then returned into downtown.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=36}}

In 1916 City Council authorized a bond issue of $6 million with an interest rate of 4.25 percent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|title=... Bonds To Pay 4{{fraction|1|4}}% Interest |newspaper=[[Cincinnati Post]] |page=12 |date=June 17, 1916 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} and then held a plebiscite on the rapid transit plan.&lt;ref name="April_3_1926_Enquirer" /&gt; The bond was supposed to fund a {{convert|16|mi|km}} subway system stretching across Cincinnati, which would, in turn, slow or even stop the decline of Cincinnati's population at the time. One advertisement in support of the subway proclaimed, "Every newspaper in the city is for the Loop, and practically all of the Business organizations as well as the Trades Unions."{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} On April 17, 1917, Cincinnati citizens voted in favor of using the bond for a Rapid Transit system, 30,165 to 14,286.&lt;ref name="April_3_1926_Enquirer" /&gt; The system would be built as an [[elevated railway]] through downtown, [[Evanston, Cincinnati|Evanston]], [[Oakley, Cincinnati|Oakley]], and [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]], with an underground portion to be built under the [[Miami and Erie Canal]] and extend under the [[Mill Creek (Ohio)|Mill Creek]] valley to [[St. Bernard, Ohio|St. Bernard]].{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}

However, because the United States entered [[World War I]] just 11 days earlier,&lt;ref name="2003_radel_article" /&gt; construction was halted because no capital issues of bonds were permitted during the war.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}&lt;ref name="April_3_1926_Enquirer" /&gt;{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=45}}

{{Quote|War conditions have prompted the opinion in certain official quarters that it would be unwise to proceed with the construction of the loop until after the war. High costs of materials and the difficulty in obtaining deliveries are cited as arguments in favor of the temporary abandonment of the project.|''[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]'', "Subway Again May Meet Delay: Postponement Of Plans Until After War Is Considered," April 5, 1918 (p. 9)}}

===Construction and failure===
When the war ended in 1918, costs had increased. By 1919 the cost of construction had doubled,&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|71}} increasing the original price to complete the loop from $12 million to $13 million.&lt;ref name="April_3_1926_Enquirer" /&gt; Regardless, the city began work on January 28, 1920,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenoh.com/subway.html|title=The Cincinnati Subway System|work=Ohio Exploration|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the current intersection of Walnut Street and Central Parkway,{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} and the city planned to raise the money to complete the loop later, since funds were so low and there was a shortage in construction materials. The subway's construction caused the foundations of buildings along the route to crack, leading to much litigation against the subway.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} When bonds ran out in 1927, construction ended with {{convert|7|mi|km|0|spell=in}} of subway dug or graded, but no track had been laid.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}
[[File:Cincinnati Subway Entrance 01 2005 10 22.JPG|thumb|A station platform and unlaid trackbed.|left]]New estimates to complete the loop ranged from an additional $6 million to $12 million.&lt;ref name="2003_radel_article" /&gt; The eastern part of the loop was later canceled as a cost-cutting measure.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} The boulevard that ran on top of the subway, Central Parkway, officially opened to traffic on October 1, 1928, and was followed by a week of public celebration.&lt;ref name="singer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Allen J.|title=The Cincinnati subway: history of rapid transit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7F8zr3DwTsC|accessdate=July 23, 2011|series=Images of America Series|date=May 26, 2003|publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]|location=Mount Pleasant, SC|isbn=978-0-7385-2314-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}} However, by the late 1920s, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] had severely impacted the city, because alcoholic beverages, a major source of revenue for the city, were not allowed to be purchased.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} Still, as late as 1926–1927, new tunnels, such as the Hopple Street Tunnel, were being built.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}

Once it became apparent that the original rapid transit plan had failed, political infighting in City Hall stalled any new progress,&lt;ref name="2003_radel_article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|73}} due to an anti-City Hall campaign led by city manager [[Murray Seasongood]] beginning in 1920.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} Newspapers started to print articles arguing against the subway, using such rationales as the tight curve of the subway and its small tunnels to try to advocate against its completion. 

Along with this, the cities of Norwood and Saint Bernard continuously negotiated with the city of Cincinnati, pushing the construction back another year. Two more months were piled on to the delay also Brighton residents were upset with the blast damages destroying their property. The construction methods created suspicion to state examiners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/dote/about-transportation-engineering/historical-information/the-cincinnati-subway/|title=The Cincinnati Subway|website=www.cincinnati-oh.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1929, Seasongood &amp;ndash; by then the Mayor &amp;ndash; discontinued the Rapid Transit Commission, which until then had been in control of the subway's construction; that year, his own office took control of the project.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} Any hope of raising the money to complete the subway was further delayed with the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|81}} Though few citizens owned automobiles when Mayor Hunt first planned rapid transit in 1910, their increasing popularity and convenience helped fuel critics' arguments against a subway system. They began referring to the project as "Cincinnati's [[White Elephant]]."&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|71, 81}} Even so, the "temporary" hiatus on construction was expected to end after the economy got better, and many Cincinnatians, including Seasongood, hoped that the subway would finally be completed.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}

===Attempts at revival===
There have been many attempts to complete the tunnels, but few people know why the subway was never completed or used for another significant purpose.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} In 1936 the city commissioned the Engineers' Club of Cincinnati to produce a report on how to use the unfinished rapid transit property.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|82}} The report could not find any use for the tunnels other than what they had been designed for. Because the city's needs had changed from twenty years earlier, the report suggested that the subway "should be forgotten".&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|82}} In 1939 the tunnels were researched for possible automobile traffic, but were found to be unsuitable for that use.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|82}} In 1940 the city sought the advice of several experts to settle once and for all the fate of the subway. The report recommended placing all streetcar and trolley transportation underground (i.e., a subway), but Cincinnati already had too many other expensive public projects underway. In any case, the plan was put on hold yet again when the United States entered World War II in 1941.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|82, 92}}

During World War II, the city was focused on war-time rationing, so completing the subway was not a high priority.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|82}} The tunnels were suggested as possible air raid shelters, but the idea was never implemented.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Underground storage of commercial and military supplies was also proposed as a use for the tunnels, or as a pathway to bring freight into the heart of the city, but both ideas were rejected because they would delay bringing mass transit to Cincinnati.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|92}} After the war ended the City Planning Commission decided to not include the subway in its plans. Instead, the commission would use the loop's right-of-way as pathways for [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]] and the [[Ohio State Route 562|Norwood Lateral]].&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|98,103}} Then, in the 1950s, a massive {{convert|52|in|m|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="modern_subway_options"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cincinnati Considers Options For Decades-Old Unfinished Subway|accessdate=2008-05-12|url=http://www.wlwt.com/news/14790068/detail.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524084219/http://www.wlwt.com/news/14790068/detail.html|archivedate=2011-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[water main]] was laid in the northbound tunnel to save $300,000&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|102}} by not digging a new tunnel for the water main.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} According to the engineering firm [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]], a redundant water main was installed during the construction of [[Fort Washington Way]] so the water main in the subway could be removed easily.&lt;ref name="2002_7_29_pilcher_article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilcher|first=James|title=Abandoned subway could save light rail plan|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=July 29, 2002|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/07/29/loc_abandoned_subway.html|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an escape clause in Ordinance No. 154-1956 that states, "in the event said section of the rapid transit subway is, at some future date, needed for rapid transit purposes, the Water Works shall remove said main at its sole cost."&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|102}}

In the 1960's the Hamilton county proposed the Liberty Street station be turned into a bomb shelter.  However, the result was a very weak attempt at a fallout shelter that would not provide much for those residing in it. There were also suggestions by investors to turn the tunnels into passages for freight trains, but that project failed due to the sharp turns existing in the tunnels that freight trains could not handle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cincinnati-transit.net|title=Cincinnati-Transit.net|website=www.cincinnati-transit.net|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subway bonds were paid off in 1966 at a total cost of $13,019,982.45.&lt;ref name="2003_radel_article" /&gt; Around that time Meier's Wine Cellars Inc. wanted to use the subway tunnels to store wine, as well as install a bottling operation to draw tourists, but it fell through due to a lack of proper building codes.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt;{{rp|110}} In the 1970s [[Nick Clooney]] wanted to turn parts of the tunnel into an underground mall and a night club, but that fell through early on due to insurance issues.&lt;ref name="New_life_for_old_subway"&gt;Krewedl, Derek. (October 22, 2002) "New life for old subway?", Downtowner. pp.1,14.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=110}} In the 1980s the city pitched the tunnels to [[Hollywood]] filmmakers as a location to shoot subway scenes.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=110}} In particular, the location was presented to the makers of ''[[Batman Forever]]'', but as of 2008 the tunnels had not been used in any feature films.{{sfnp|Singer|2003|p=110}}

In 2002, a regional [[light rail]] system was proposed to use the tunnels;{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} the system would cost $2.6 billion and take thirty years to build.&lt;ref name="2002_7_29_pilcher_article" /&gt; The tunnels were favored because they were in an ideal location, they could easily be used to connect the east side and the west sides of Cincinnati, and they would have saved the city at least $100 million in construction costs at the time.&lt;ref name="2002_7_29_pilcher_article" /&gt; The light rail plan, called [[MetroMoves]], proposed a tax levy that would have raised sales tax in Hamilton county by a half-cent.&lt;ref name="2002_10_6_pilcher_article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilcher|first=James|title=Metro plan hits wall of resistance|newspaper=[[Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=November 6, 2002|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2002/11/06/loc_literail06.html|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} The plan was voted down by more than a 2-to-1 ratio,&lt;ref name="2002_10_6_pilcher_article" /&gt; with 68% opposing MetroMoves.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} Still, an underground portion of the [[Riverfront Transit Center]] was built to serve the proposed, unbuilt MetroMoves lines; this transit center was later served by another Cincinnati streetcar line, the [[Cincinnati Streetcar]].{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}

==Current status==
The uncompleted subway tunnels and stations have been described as "in good shape."&lt;ref name="2002_7_29_pilcher_article" /&gt; This is partially credited to the original construction quality,&lt;ref name="New_life_for_old_subway" /&gt; and partially because Cincinnati needs to maintain the tunnel, using tax revenues, due to the presence of Central Parkway on top of it.&lt;ref name="modern_subway_options" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2002_7_29_pilcher_article" /&gt;

In 2008 it was estimated that it would cost $2.6 million to simply keep maintaining the tunnels, $19 million to fill the tunnels with dirt, and $100.5 million to revive the tunnels for modern subway use.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}} Relocating the {{convert|52|in|m|adj=on}} water main would cost $14 million.&lt;ref name="modern_subway_options" /&gt; {{As of|2016|08|alt=As of August 2016}}, the abandoned tunnel is used to carry the relocated water main and some [[optical fiber cable]]s.{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}

The abandoned tunnels are frequented by [[urban exploration|urban explorers]] and the [[homelessness in the United States|homeless]].{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}

===Stations and route===
[[File:Cincinnati subway tunnel door.jpg|thumb|This tunnel entrance near the Western Hills Viaduct is clearly visible from [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]].]]
Seven stations were completed along Central Parkway: four underground and three above ground. The underground stations remain intact{{sfnp|Hawkins|2016}}, but the above-ground stations were demolished when [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|I-75]] was built in the 1960s. The underground stations' locations are at Race Street, Liberty Street, Linn Street, and Brighton Place, while the above-ground stations' locations were at Marshall Street, Ludlow Avenue, Clifton Avenue, and Reading Road

The first station was the Race Street Station, which was to serve as the main hub. It was configured with the [[Island platform|platform in the center]], with the subway running along the north and south side. Next was Liberty Street, which was a through-station. It was a simple design with a platform on each side of the track. Third was Linn Street, also a through station. Laid out similarly to Liberty Street, this station has been sealed up, and can be easily missed when walking through. Fourth was Brighton Place, another through-station.

Marshall Street was the most grand of the above-ground stations, located to the west near the Mill Creek Valley. Ludlow Avenue Station was constructed under the south side of the Ludlow Viaduct and was also a through-station. The last to be completed was Clifton Avenue, which was located where the street passes under present day I-75. There were additional stations in the plan; however, funding ran out as the project reached [[Norwood, Ohio|Norwood]].&lt;ref name="subway_movie_2010"&gt;''[http://www.thecincinnatisubway.com Cincinnati's Abandoned Subway]'', (2010).

===Engineering===
The subway tunnels run north and south. Each of the two halves of the tube has a minimum width of {{convert|13|ft|m}} and a height of {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m}}. Each tunnel has parallel wooden stringers which are bolted to the floor, and are intended to support steel rails that were never laid. They are {{convert|59|in|m}} from center to center, which is {{convert|6|in}}  wider than most railway lines. All curves in the tunnel are gradual, and on those curves [[Cant (road/rail)|the outside stringer was raised higher than the inner stringer]] to accommodate trains traveling at speeds of more than {{convert|40|mph}}.&lt;ref name="april_24_1936_times_star"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Stimson|first=George P.|title=Unused Subway System is in Almost Perfect Condition|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Times-Star]]|page=2|date=April 24, 1936|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many details of the unfinished subway system, such as a provision for a station at Mohawk Corner, where the wall has been set back. At Walnut Street the lines begin to curve south to go into downtown, but they are stopped short by a bricked up wall. The subway tunnel is double-tracked throughout its entire length, with a concrete wall separating the two tracks. Openings in the wall enable persons to step from one track to another. The tunnels are well ventilated and provide much light until Liberty Street is reached.&lt;ref name="april_24_1936_times_star"/&gt;

==Geography==
{{main|Caribbean#Geography_and_geology}}
The Caribbean is composed of an archipelago of islands between North and South America.  These islands are [[Antigua]], [[Aruba]], [[Barbados]], [[Bonaire]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Cuba]], [[Curacao]], [[Dominica]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Grenada]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]], [[Martinique]], [[Montserrat]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Saba]], [[Saint Croix]], [[Saint Eustatius]], [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]], [[Saint Kitts]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Tortola]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago]].The climate average annual temperature of the Caribbean is 81&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Caribbean/average-annual-temperature-rainfall.php|title=Caribbean Weather: Annual Temperature &amp; Rainfall - Current Results|website=www.currentresults.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental changes==
===Rise in sea level===
Rising sea levels are expected to cause [[coastal erosion]] due to climate change. According to NASA, the sea level is expected to increase by {{convert|1|-|4|feet|sigfig=1|order=flip}} by 2100.&lt;ref name=Jackson2016 /&gt; Rise in sea level could impact coastal communities of the Caribbean if they are less than {{convert|10|feet|sigfig=1|order=flip}} above the sea. In Latin American and the Caribbean, it is expected that 29 – 32 million people may be affected by the sea level rise because they live below this threshold. The Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago are expected to be the most affected because at least 80% of the total land is below the sea level.&lt;ref name=Lewsey2004 &gt;{{cite journal|author1=Clement Lewsey|author2=Gonzalo Cid|author3=Edward Kruse|title=Assessing climate change impacts on coastal infrastructure in the Eastern Caribbean|journal=Marine Policy|date=2004-09-01|volume=28|issue=5|pages=393–409|doi=10.1016/j.marpol.2003.10.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Borja G.

In 2004, a study reported that 12 million tourists had visited the Caribbean.

===Increased air and sea surface temperature===
[[File:2017 Atlantic hurricane season summary map.png|thumb|right|Summary map of the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season from NASA|306x306px]]
An increase in air and [[sea surface]] temperature is predicted to promote the development of stronger [[tropical cyclone]] (also known as hurricanes). Key factors that lead to the development of hurricanes are the warm temperatures of the air and sea surface. The higher temperatures increase the probability of the storm to become a hurricane. This provides the energy for the hurricane to intensify.&lt;ref name="MSCF2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-are-hurricanes-58.html|title=What Are Hurricanes?|last1=Wall|first1=Jennifer|website=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plumer2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plumer|first1=Brad|title=How do hurricanes form? A step-by-step guide|url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/10/6/13191010/how-hurricanes-form-tropical-storms-guide|website=Vox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the United States [[National Hurricane Center]] reported that the [[North Atlantic basin tropical cyclone|North Atlantic basin]] was highly active because four [[tropical storms]] formed and they all became hurricanes. They report a higher than average record on the number of tropical storms that developed into hurricanes this year.&lt;ref name="MATW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Monthly Atlantic Tropical Weather Summary|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/MIATWSAT.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these four hurricanes, [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] and [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]], hit the islands in the Caribbean. Once at the Caribbean, both Irma and Maria became Category 5 hurricanes.&lt;ref name="RAIN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/28/16362522/hurricane-maria-2017-irma-harvey-rain-flooding-climate-change|title=One of the clearest signs of climate change in Hurricanes Maria, Irma, and Harvey was the rain}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA reported that the temperature of the sea surface in the Caribbean when Irma became a hurricane was {{convert|86|F|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="MATW" /&gt; The required temperature for the development of a major storm is suggested to be higher than {{convert|80|F|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name="Plumer2016" /&gt;  [[File:Hurricane Maria (2017) 170923-H-NI589-0002 (37312143081).jpg|thumb|right| Destroyed homes after Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico|305x305px]]Hurricanes of category 5 have wind speeds greater than 157&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="MSCF2015" /&gt; In addition to strong, Hurricanes Irma and Maria also carried more rainfall than previous storms. The warmer the air temperature the more water can be held by air leading to more [[precipitation]]. Multiple sources suggest that this increase in strengthening and precipitation in recent hurricanes is due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Michael|title=Climate change in the Caribbean – learning lessons from Irma and Maria|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/06/climate-change-in-the-caribbean-learning-lessons-from-irma-and-maria|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAIN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CCITCMI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iadb.org/en/office-of-evaluation-and-oversight/climate-change-in-the-caribbean-small-island-states,18283.html|title=Climate Change in the Caribbean Small Island States|website=Inter-American Development Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wallace-Wells|first1=David|title=Will Irma Finally Change the Way We Talk About Climate?|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/09/will-irma-finally-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate.html|website=Daily Intelligencer|accessdate=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurricane Irma and Maria had a total of {{convert|20|inch|order=flip}} of rainfall. In Cuba, Hurricane Irma sustained precipitation was at {{convert|10.8|inch|order=flip}} per hour. In Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria had a sustained precipitation of {{convert|6.44|inch|order=flip}} per hour.&lt;ref name="RAIN" /&gt;

An increase in surface temperature has also been suggested to affect the [[coral reef]]s. In 2005 in the Caribbean, a rise in the sea surface temperature is thought to have caused widespread coral bleaching. In this study, they evaluate if this increase in sea surface temperature was due to natural climate variability or human activity. They concluded that it would be very unlikely that natural climate variability alone could account for this event. Their model suggests that this event would occur once every 1000 years if human activity is not taken into consideration in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Simon D. Donner|author2=Thomas R. Knutson|title=Model-based assessment of the role of human-induced climate change in the 2005 Caribbean coral bleaching event|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2007-03-27|volume=104|issue=13|pages=5483–5488|doi=10.1073/pnas.0610122104|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/13/5483|pmc=1838457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and economic impacts==

Multiple sources suggest that the Caribbean is in a particularly difficult position to address climate change.&lt;ref name="Batiste2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reyer2017" /&gt; The Caribbean's long history of colonialism for the extraction of goods, such as sugar, has left them dependent on colonial entities. This has created a disadvantage to the Caribbean as they lack the ability to compete with the current [[world economy]] and be self-sufficient. Centuries of [[colonialism]] has generated a feedback loop of the dependence of the Caribbean’s economy on global powers.&lt;ref name=Batiste2016 /&gt;

The damages expected from climate change will weaken the economy of the Caribbean as it will target some of the major sources of income, like tourism. It has been estimated that 25% to 35% of the Caribbean’s economy relies on tourism.&lt;ref name="Lewsey2004" /&gt; Tourism could be significantly reduced if less tourists travel to the Caribbean because of an increase in the strength and likelihood of hurricanes in the next century. It is expected that hurricane costs are expected to range between US$350 to $550 million or about 11% to 17% of the current [[GDP]] for hurricane damages annually. They expect that the Bahamas, Haiti, and Jamaica are the islands that will suffer the most from climate change. In addition, they suggest that agricultural and rural areas are among the sectors that will be most affected by hurricanes in the Caribbean. They estimate that damages to these areas could cost about US$3 million per year by 2050 and US$12 – $15 million by 2100.&lt;ref name="Reyer2017" /&gt;

'''David Benvenisti''' ({{lang-he-n|דוד בנבנשתי}}) (1897 in [[Thessaloniki]] – 1993 in [[Jerusalem]]) a descendant of a known rabbis family in [[Thessaloniki]]) was a geographer and educator; received the '[[Israel Prize]]' of 1982 for his life achievements in education and geography of Israel; and the [[Yakir Yerushalayim]] in 1969.

Benvenisti was married to Leah Friedman from [[Suwalki]] Poland. His sons are: [[Meron Benvenisti]], a historian and writer who was the deputy mayor of Jerusalem for many years; and [[Refael (Rafi) Benvenisti]], an economist and historian. His grandson is [[Eyal Benvenisti]], a professor of law in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[New York City]].

==Biography==
David Benvenisti's grandfather Shmuel Yosef was the Chief Justice of the Jewish Court in [[Thessaloniki]]. Emigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1913 to learn rabbinical studies in [[Jerusalem]]. In 1918 he finished studies in a teachers college 'The Hebrew Teachers' College of Jerusalem'. He enlisted in the Hebrew Battalion from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] of the [[British Army]] in 1918 and served during the [[First World War]] in Palestine and the [[Middle East]] until 1920.

In the 1930s he established with friends the now 'Israel Youth Hostel Association'. He received an M.A. degree in Geography from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] in 1935. He was a member of the Jewish [[Haganah]] organization and was wounded in the battle of the siege of [[Jerusalem]] in 1948.

==Pedagogic and public career==
He was a teacher and a principal of an elementary school in Beit Hakerem in [[Jerusalem]] for more than 40 years. During his tenure years he refused to leave his pupils for higher positions. He established with friends in 1927 the first 'Palestine Hikers Association' that organized hiking and car tours of Palestine and the [[Middle east]]. After retirement from teaching he became in 1964 the first director general of the Ben Zvi Institute for the study of Jewish communities in the East' in [[Jerusalem]] and the chairman of the Committee for Naming Roads and Streets of Jerusalem.

==Literary career==

Benvenisti wrote many teaching books and maps for school on the geography of Israel for many years. He wrote together with his friends one of the first guide books of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] after the [[First World War]]. He edited books and wrote many articles on the history of the Jewish Community of [[Thessaloniki]]. He wrote his memoirs on his childhood in [[Thessaloniki]], his service in the Hebrew Battalion in the First World War, and his years as a teacher and principal of his school.

[[File:Dethatcher.jpg|thumb|Tow tine dethatchers can be attached to garden tractors]]

A '''dethatcher''', or '''lawn scarifier''' is a device that removes [[Thatch (lawn)|thatch]] from [[lawn]]s. Types of dethatchers include motorized dethatchers or those that can be pulled behind a garden tractor.

== Thatch removal (dethatching) ==
[[File:Vertikutierer unten.jpg|thumb|Bottom side of an electric lawn scarifier showing rotating metal blades]]
Scarification or de-thatching of lawns or turf is a mechanical process whereby the surface and subsurface of the lawn, green or sports pitch is rigorously abraded by penetrating metal blades, tines or prongs. 

The process is usually carried out by machines of a professional standard which are normally powered by gasoline engines. Smaller, less rigorous electric machines are also available for the domestic market. The process of scarifying is designed to remove thatch from lawns.

Thatch is a build-up of organic matter which can include dead grass, leaves, stems, [[stolon]]s, [[rhizome]]s and overcrowded grass roots and lateral weed growth. Thatch can stifle the growth and health of grass or [[Artificial turf|turf]]. Removing the thatch helps the grass by encouraging it to thicken up and also makes it stronger and less susceptible to disease. Reducing thatch levels increases the levels of water, air and nutrients that can get through to the root zone of the grass plants. Significant thatch problems in lawns can cause diseases and can encourage moss to grow in the areas where grass has died. A by-product of scarifying or de-thatching is that [[moss]] is also removed, and depending on how deep the scarifying blades are set, root cutting can also occur, and this in turn helps grass to thicken up over time. Scarifying is normally carried out in autumn or spring. When scarifying or de-thatching, not all thatch should be removed as a small amount of thatch is beneficial to the lawn. A lawn that has excessive thatch may feel spongy when trod upon. After removing thatch, it can be swept or raked up using a [[lawn sweeper]].

'''Diego de Torre(s) y Moyachoque''' ([[Tunja]], [[New Kingdom of Granada]], 1549 - [[Madrid]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], 4 April 1590) was ''[[cacique]]'' of [[Turmequé]], in the former [[Muisca Confederation]], under Spanish rule. He served as chief from 1571 to his death. De Torres y Moyachoque was a [[mestizo]]; the child of a [[List of conquistadors in Colombia|Spanish conquistador]] and a [[Muisca people|Muisca]] mother. He is known for his defense of the local Muisca and resistance against the Spanish [[encomienda|encomenderos]], particularly his half-brother Pedro de Torres. De Torres y Moyachoque is also known as the first [[cartographer]] of the lands surrounding the capital of the New Kingdom of Granada; [[Bogotá|Santa Fe de Bogotá]].

De Torres y Moyachoque traveled twice to Spain, first in 1575-1577 and the second journey in the 1580s, where he presented complaints about the mistreatment of the Muisca by the Spanish colonisers to the Spanish King [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]]. After this travel, he stayed, married and died in Madrid on April 4, 1590.

Diego de Torres y Moyachoque was born in the city of [[Tunja]], former capital of the central Muisca Confederation called Hunza in 1549 from a Spanish conquistador, Juan de Torre(s) and the eldest sister of the previous ''cacique'' whose name is unknown, Catalina Moyachoque.&lt;ref name=BoyacaCultural&gt;{{es}} [http://www.boyacacultural.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1023&amp;Itemid=119 Diego de Torres y Moyachoque, ''cacique'' de Turmequé]&lt;/ref&gt; Catalina was approximately 12 years old when she gave birth to Diego de Torres y Moyachoque.&lt;ref name=GeniCatalinaMoyachoque&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Catalina-DE-MOYACHOQUE-Princesa-Muisca/3995608 Catalina Moyachoque] - Geni&lt;/ref&gt; He had one sister Beatriz, a half-sister María and a half-brother Pedro de Torre.&lt;ref name=GeniDiegoMoyachoque&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/DIEGO-DE-TORRE-Y-MOYACHOQUE-Cacique-de-Turmeque/6000000027819055003 Diego de Torre y Moyachoque] - Geni&lt;/ref&gt; Beatriz was partner of the former priest of [[Vélez, Santander|Vélez]], [[Santander Department|Santander]], Francisco Sánchez Herreño, to whom she bore a daughter: Francisca González de la Nava y Herreño.&lt;ref name=GeniBeatrizMoyachoque&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Beatriz-DE-TORRE-Y-MOYACHOQUE-Mestiza-de-Turmequ%C3%A9/6000000003125902968 Beatriz de Torre y Moyachoque] - Geni&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at the school for mestizo children of conquistadors set up by Diego de Aquila and later at the Dominican Convent (''Convento de los Dominicos'') in Tunja, where he was educated in grammar, religion, moral and law. The ''cacique'' was also trained in horse-riding and an excellent archer.&lt;ref name=BoyacaCultural/&gt;

De Torres y Moyachoque inherited the ''cacicazgo'' at age 21/22 in 1571, when his uncle, the former ''cacique'', died.&lt;ref name=BancoTurmeque&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/mayo2012/levantamiento-del-Cacique-de-Turmeque El levantamiento del ''Cacique'' de Turmequé] - [[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt; He referred to himself as the ''cacique cristiano''; (Catholic) Christian ''cacique''.&lt;ref name=Restrepo_p21&gt;Restrepo, 2010, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muisca Confederation was mostly conquered during the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]] from 1537 to 1540, and the town of Turmequé, at about {{convert|53|km|mi}} from Tunja, was submitted by main conquistador [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] on July 20, 1537.&lt;ref name=websiteTurmeque&gt;{{es}} [http://www.turmeque-boyaca.gov.co/index.shtml Official website Turmequé]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EspectadorTurmeque&gt;{{es}} [http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/cultura/el-legado-del-cacique-turmeque-articulo-391159 El legado del cacique Turmequé] - [[El Espectador]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1574, the ''cacique'' of Turmequé had a dispute with the [[encomienda|encomendero]] of the town, his half-brother Pedro de Torres, son of Juan de Torres and his first Spanish wife Leonor Ruiz Herrezuelos.&lt;ref name=GeniPedroTorre&gt;[https://www.geni.com/people/Pedro-de-Torre/6000000019554208337 Pedro de Torre] - Geni&lt;/ref&gt; The dispute was about the mistreatment of the indigenous people under the encomienda rules. The ''cacique'' of [[Tibasosa]] Alonso de Silva, also a mestizo, joined De Torres in his resistance.&lt;ref name=BancoTurmeque/&gt; De Torres y Moyachoque traveled from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1575 to hand over to the [[King of Spain]] a series of demands for the rights of the indigenous people of Turmequé.&lt;ref name=EspectadorTurmeque/&gt; He stranded in [[Santo Domingo]], the capital of the Caribbean and stayed there for almost three years, studying the works of Bartolomé de las Casas, before traveling on to [[Madrid]], where he arrived in 1577.&lt;ref name=BancoTurmeque/&gt;

In Spain, De Torres y Moyachoque befriended Juan Bautista de Monzón and both traveled back to South America, De Monzón being the new ''visitador'' of the colony.&lt;ref name=BancoTurmeque/&gt; Here, the Spanish colonisers immediately accused both men to work against the [[Crown of Castile|Spanish Crown]] and convicted De Torres y Moyachoque to death. He promptly fled into the mountains of the [[Altiplano Cundiboyacense]], but later returned to Turmequé. In 1578, he made the first map of the [[Bogotá savanna]], including Santa Fe de Bogotá and surrounding settlements, the [[Bogotá River]] and [[Sué]] rising over the [[Orinoquía Region|Llanos Orientales]].&lt;ref name=BoyacaCultural2/&gt;

In the meantime, in 1581, a new ''visitador'' had arrived with his delegation from Spain, Juan Prieto de Orellana. Diego de Torres presented himself to the new Spanish rulers and was sent again to Spain. There, he presented his ''Memoria de los Agravios'' about the mistreatments of the Muisca to the Spanish King [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]] in 1584.&lt;ref name=Restrepo_p16&gt;Restrepo, 2010, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; At these encounters, De Torres y Moyachoque was permitted to be seated instead of kneeling, which was common for visitors to the Spanish King.&lt;ref name=Restrepo_p31&gt;Restrepo, 2010, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; He was acquitted of the charges, married Juana de Oropesa, and died in the capital of the Spanish kingdom on April 4, 1590 at age 40.&lt;ref name=BancoTurmeque/&gt;&lt;ref name=BoyacaCultural2&gt;{{es}} [http://www.boyacacultural.com/turmeque/diegotorres.php Personajes - Diego de Torres y Moyachoque]&lt;/ref&gt;

== El Carnero ==
The story about Diego de Torres y Moyachoque has been told by [[Juan Rodríguez Freyle]] in his famous work ''[[El Carnero]]'' in 1636, albeit in a different manner. In this book, Rodríguez Freyle, attributed all the conflicts to jealousy over the [[Women in Muisca society|indigenous women]] and De Torres y Moyachoque plays a minor part in the story about [[adultery]] and [[corruption]].&lt;ref name=BancoTurmeque/&gt;&lt;ref name=Restrepo_p26&gt;Restrepo, 2010, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Although he is commonly viewed as a mestizo who was highly hispanised,&lt;ref name=Restrepo_p19&gt;Restrepo, 2010, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; De Torres y Moyachoque is considered one of the most important Colombian people of the 16th century and in Turmequé a monument honouring the Muisca has been constructed.&lt;ref name=websiteTurmeque/&gt;&lt;ref name=BoyacaCultural2/&gt;

An '''environmental impact statement''' ('''EIS'''), under [[United States environmental law]], is a document required by the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) for certain actions "significantly affecting the quality of the human environment".&lt;ref&gt;[http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, 42 USC Sections  4321-4347] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017083720/http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/regs/nepa/nepaeqia.htm |date=2008-10-17 }} (enacted 1970-01-01) from [http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/nepanet.htm Council on Environmental Quality NEPAnet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010172140/http://ceq.hss.doe.gov/nepa/nepanet.htm |date=2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An EIS is a tool for decision making.  It describes the positive and negative [[Environmental impact assessment|environmental effects]] of a proposed action, and it usually also lists one or more alternative actions that may be chosen instead of the action described in the EIS. Several [[U.S. state]] governments require that a document similar to an EIS be submitted to the state for certain actions.  For example, in California, an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) must be submitted to the state for certain actions, as described in the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA). One of the primary authors of the act is [[Lynton K. Caldwell]].

==Purpose==
The purpose of the NEPA is to promote informed decision-making by federal agencies by making "detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts" available to both agency leaders and the public.&lt;ref&gt;See the Supreme Court decision: ''Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council'', 490 U.S. 332, 349 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  The NEPA was the first piece of legislation that created a comprehensive method to assess potential and existing environmental risks at once.  It also encourages communication and cooperation between all the actors involved in environmental decisions, including government officials, private businesses, and citizens.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, an EIS acts as an enforcement mechanism to ensure that the federal government adheres to the goals and policies outlined in the NEPA.  An EIS should be created in a timely manner as soon as the agency is planning development or is presented with a proposal for development.  The statement should use an interdisciplinary approach so that it accurately assesses both the physical and social impacts of the proposed development.&lt;ref name="EIS"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many instances an action may be deemed subject to NEPA’s EIS requirement even though the action is not specifically sponsored by a federal agency. These factors may include actions that receive federal funding, federal licensing or authorization, or that are subject to federal control.&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2008). [https://www.amazon.com/NEPA-Environmental-Planning-Techniques-Practitioners/dp/0849375592/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486526090&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=NEPA+and+Environmental+Planning%3A+Tools%2C+Techniques%2C+and+Approaches+for+Practitioners NEPA and Environmental Planning: Tools, Techniques, and Approaches for Practitioners], pp 148-149. CRC Press. {{ISBN|9780849375590}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all federal actions require a full EIS.  If the action may or may not cause a significant impact, the agency can first prepare a smaller, shorter document called an '''Environmental Assessment''' (EA).  The finding of the EA determines whether an EIS is required.  If the EA indicates that no significant impact is likely, then the agency can release a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) and carry on with the proposed action.  Otherwise, the agency must then conduct a full-scale EIS.  Most EAs result in a FONSI.  A limited number of federal actions may avoid the EA and EIS requirements under NEPA if they meet the criteria for a categorical exclusion (CATEX).  A CATEX is usually permitted when a course of action is identical or very similar to a past course of action and the impacts on the environment from the previous action can be assumed for the proposed action, or for building a structure within the footprint of an existing, larger facility or complex.  For example, two proposed sections of [[Interstate 69 in Kentucky]] were granted a CATEX from NEPA requirements as these portions of I-69 will be routed over existing freeways requiring little more than minor spot improvements and a change of highway signage.   Additionally, a CATEX can be issued during an [[emergency]] when time does not permit the preparation of an EA or EIS.  An example of the latter is when the Federal Highway Administration issued a CATEX to construct the [[I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge|replacement bridge]] in the wake of the [[I-35W Mississippi River Bridge Collapse]].

Contrary to a widespread misconception, NEPA does not prohibit the federal government or its licensees/permittees from harming the environment, but merely requires that the prospective impacts be understood and disclosed in advance.  The intent of NEPA is to help key decisionmakers and stakeholders balance the need to implement an action with its impacts on the surrounding human and natural environment, and provide opportunities for mitigating those impacts while keeping the cost and schedule for implementing the action under control.  However, many activities require various federal permits to comply with other environmental legislation, such as the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], the [[Clean Water Act]], [[Endangered Species Act]] and Section 4(f) of the [[Federal Highway Act]] to name a few. Similarly, many states and local jurisdictions have enacted environmental laws and ordinances, requiring additional state and local permits before the action can proceed.  Obtaining these permits typically requires the lead agency to implement the '''Least Environmentally Damaging Practicable Alternative (LEDPA)''' to comply with federal, state, and local environmental laws that are ancillary to NEPA.  In some instances, the result of NEPA analysis leads to abandonment or cancellation of the proposed action, particularly when the "No Action" alternative ends up being the LEDPA.

==Layout==
An EIS typically has four sections:&lt;ref&gt;Eccleston, Charles H. (2014). The EIS Book: Managing and Preparing Environmental Impact Statements. Chapter 6. CRC Press. {{ISBN|978-1466583634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* An Introduction including a statement of the '''Purpose and Need''' of the '''Proposed Action'''.
:* A description of the '''Affected Environment'''.
:* A '''Range of Alternatives''' to the proposed action.  Alternatives are considered the "heart" of the EIS.
:* An '''analysis''' of the environmental impacts of each of the possible alternatives.  This section covers topics such as:
::* Impacts to '''threatened or endangered species'''
::* '''Air and water quality''' impacts
::* Impacts to '''historic and cultural sites, particularly sites of significant importance to Indigenous peoples. 
::* '''Social and Economic impacts''' to local communities, often including consideration of attributes such as '''impacts to available housing stock, economic impacts to businesses, property values, aesthetics and noise''' within the affected area
::* '''Cost and Schedule Analyses''' for each alternative, including costs and timeline to mitigate expected impacts, to determine if the proposed action can be completed at a acceptable cost and within a reasonable amount of time 
While not required in the EIS, the following subjects may be included as part of the EIS or as separate documents based on agency policy.
:* '''Financial Plan''' for the proposed action identifying the sources of secured funding for the action.  For example, the Federal Highway Administration has started requiring states to include a financial plan showing that funding has been secured for major highway projects before it will approve an EIS and issue a Record of Decision.
:* An '''Environmental Mitigation Plan''' is often requested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) if substantial environmental impacts are expected from the preferred alternative.
:* '''Additional documentation''' to comply with state and local environmental policy laws and secure required federal, state, and local permits before the action can proceed.

Every EIS is required to analyze a '''No Action Alternative,''' in addition to the range of alternatives presented for study.  The No Action Alternative identifies the expected environmental impacts in the future if existing conditions were left as is with no action taken by the lead agency.  Analysis of the No Action Alternative is used to establish a baseline upon which to compare the proposed "Action" alternatives.

==NEPA process==
The NEPA process is designed to involve the public and gather the best available information in a single place so that decision makers can be fully informed when they make their choices.

This is the process of EIS
* '''Proposal:''' In this stage, the needs and objectives of a project have been decided, but the project has not been financed.
* '''Categorical Exclusion (CATEX):''' As discussed above, the government may exempt an agency from the process.  The agency can then proceed with the project and skip the remaining steps.
* '''Environmental Assessment (EA):''' The proposal is analyzed in addition to the local environment with the aim to reduce the negative impacts of the development on the area.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI):'''  Occurs when no significant impacts are identified in an EA.  A FONSI typically allows the lead agency to proceed without having to complete an EIS.

''Environmental Impact Statement''
* '''Scoping:''' The first meetings are held to discuss existing laws, the available information, and the research needed.  The tasks are divided up and a lead group is selected.  Decision makers and all those involved with the project can attend the meetings.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Notice:'''  The public is notified that the agency is preparing an EIS.  The agency also provides the public with information regarding how they can become involved in the process.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt; The agency announces its project proposal with a notice in the [[Federal Register]], notices in local media, and letters to citizens and groups that it knows are likely to be interested. Citizens and groups are welcome to send in comments helping the agency identify the issues it must address in the EIS (or EA).
* '''Draft EIS (DEIS):''' Based on both agency expertise and issues raised by the public, the agency prepares a Draft EIS with a full description of the affected environment, a reasonable range of alternatives, and an analysis of the impacts of each alternative.
* '''Comment:''' Affected individuals then have the opportunity to provide feedback through written and public hearing statements.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;
* '''Final EIS (FEIS) and Proposed Action:''' Based on the comments on the Draft EIS, the agency writes a Final EIS, and announces its Proposed Action.  The public is not invited to comment on this, but if they are still unhappy, or feel that the agency has missed a major issue, they may protest the EIS to the Director of the agency.  The Director may either ask the agency to revise the EIS, or explain to the protester why their complaints are not actually taken care of.
*'''Re-evaluation:'''  Prepared following an approved FEIS or ROD when unforeseen changes to the proposed action or its impacts occurs, or when a substantial period of time has passed between approval of an action and the planned start of said action.  Based on the significance of the changes, three outcomes may result from a re-evaluation report:  (1) the action may proceed with no substantive changes to the FEIS, (2) significant impacts are expected with the change that can be adequately addressed in a Supplemental EIS (SEIS), or (3) the circumstances force a complete change in the nature and scope of the proposed action, thereby voiding the pre-existing FEIS (and ROD, if applicable), requiring the lead agency to restart the NEPA process and prepare a new EIS to encompass the changes.
* '''Supplemental EIS (SEIS):''' Typically prepared after either a Final EIS or Record of Decision has been issued and new environmental impacts that were not considered in the original EIS are discovered, requiring the lead agency to re-evaluate its initial decision and consider new alternatives to avoid or mitigate the new impacts.  Supplemental EISs are also prepared when the size and scope of a federal action changes, when a significant period of time has lapsed since the FEIS was completed to account for changes in the surrounding environment during that time, or when all of the proposed alternatives in an EIS are deemed to have unacceptable environmental impacts and new alternatives are proposed.
* '''[[Record of Decision]] (ROD):''' Once all the protests are resolved the agency issues a Record of Decision which is its final action prior to implementation.  If members of the public are still dissatisfied with the outcome, they may sue the agency in Federal court.

Often, the agencies responsible for preparing an EA or EIS do not compile the document directly, but outsource this work to private-sector consulting firms with expertise in the proposed action and its anticipated effects on the environment.  Because of the intense level of detail required in analyzing the alternatives presented in an EIS or EA, such documents may take years or even decades to compile, and often compose of multiple volumes that can be thousands to tens of thousands of pages in length.

To avoid potential conflicts in securing required permits and approvals after the ROD is issued, the lead agency will often coordinate with stakeholders at all levels, and resolve any conflicts to the greatest extent possible during the EIS process.  Proceeding in this fashion helps avoid interagency conflicts and potential lawsuits after the lead agency reaches its decision.

===Tiering===
On exceptionally large projects, especially proposed highway and railroad corridors that cross long distances, the lead agency may use a two-tiered process prior to implementing the proposed action.  In such cases, the Tier I EIS would analyze the potential socio-environmental impacts along a general corridor, but would not identify the exact location of where the action would occur.  A Tier I ROD would be issued approving the general area where the action would be implemented.  Following the Tier I ROD, the approved Tier I area is further broken down into subareas, and a Tier II EIS is then prepared for each subarea, that identifies the exact location of where the proposed action will take place.  The preparation of Tier II EISs for each subarea proceeds at its own pace, independent from the other subareas within the Tier I area. For example, parts of the proposed [[Interstate 69]] extension in [[Indiana]] and [[Texas]] are being studied through a two-tiered process

==Strengths==
By requiring agencies to complete an EIS, the act encourages them to consider the environmental costs of a project and introduces new information into the decision-making process.  The NEPA has increased the influence of environmental analysts and agencies in the federal government by increasing their involvement in the development process.  Because an EIS requires expert skill and knowledge, agencies must hire environmental analysts.  Unlike agencies who may have other priorities, analysts are often sympathetic to environmental issues.  In addition, this feature introduces scientific procedures into the political process.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1984"&gt;Taylor, Serge. 1984. "Making Bureaucracies Think: The Environmental Impact Statement Strategy of Administrative Reform". Stanford University Press: Stanford, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The differences that exist between science and politics limit the accuracy of an EIS.  Although analysts are members of the scientific community, they are affected by the political atmosphere.  Analysts do not have the luxury of an unlimited time for research.  They are also affected by the different motives behind the research of the EIS and by different perspectives of what constitutes a good analysis.  In addition, government officials do not want to reveal an environmental problem from within their own agency.&lt;ref name="Taylor 1984"/&gt;

Citizens often misunderstand the environmental assessment process.  The public does not realize that the process is only meant to gather information relevant to the decision.  Even if the statement predicts negative impacts of the project, decision makers can still proceed with the proposal.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

Environmental impact statements presented to citizens and government officials frequently include very precise data.  However, the quality and context of the data, such as the margin of error and the range, is omitted.&lt;ref name="EIA"/&gt;

[[Biodiversity]] on the scale of [[agricultural]] fields or landscapes, which provides [[ecosystem services]] that support [[Sustainable agriculture|sustainable agricultural]] production and can also have a positive spin-off to the regional and global environment and society as a whole{{cn|date=August 2014}}.

== Functional agrobiodiversity conceptual diagram ==
[[File:FAB conceptual diagram.jpg|691x922px]]

Functional AgroBiodiversity provides regulating, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being. Positive synergies often exist among regulating, provisioning and cultural services and with biodiversity conservation as can be seen from this conceptual diagram. The green area in the diagram highlights the core focus of the European Learning Network. The red area highlights positive spin-off of Functional AgroBiodiversity to the local (e.g. water quality, recreation) and global environment (e.g. [[climate change]]) and society as a whole. The graph is adapted from the [[Millennium Ecosystem Assessment]] (2005). Supporting services are not included as they are not directly used by the people.

Recently, a project has been initiated which is called 'European Learning Network on Functional AgroBiodiversity', of which the secretariat is held by [[ECNC-European Centre for Nature Conservation|ECNC]]. The goal of this network is to exchange knowledge and experience between across country and language borders and between different actors within the field of Functional AgroBiodiversity.

'''Har Hotzvim''' ({{lang-he-n|הר חוצבים}}, ''lit''. Stonecutter's Mountain), also '''Campus of Science-Rich Industries''' ({{Hebrew|קריית תעשיות עתירות מדע}}, ''Kiryat Ta'asiyot Atirot Mada'') is a high-tech industrial park located in northwest [[Jerusalem]]. It is the city's main zone for science-based and technology companies, among them  [[Intel]], [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[NDS Group|NDS]] (now [[Cisco]]), [[RAD Data Communications|RAD Data]], [[Mobileye]], [[Ophir Optronics]], [[Sandvine]], [[Radware]], [[IDT Global Israel]], [[Medtronic]], [[Johnson and Johnson]] and more.&lt;ref name="official"&gt;[http://www.hotzvim.org.il/about-in-english/ Official website (English)]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to large companies, the park also hosts about 100 small and medium-sized high-tech companies, as well as a technological incubator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biojerusalem.org.il/database_tpi.asp?ID=1 Biojerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Har Hotzvim provided employment for 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1035935.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Har Hotzvim entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Har Hotzvim industrial park and shopping mall ]]
[[File:TevaFactoryJerusalem9.jpg| thumb|[[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]] factory at Har Hotzvim]]

The park was founded in the early 1970s by the Jerusalem Economic Corporation, in order to facilitate the development of a [[high tech]] industry in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jec.co.il/46-en/Calcalit.aspx  Jerusalem Economic Corporation - Company's Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the location was at the edge of the [[built up area]] of the city, but over the years several major roads were built and accessibility to the site was improved; including: the [[Begin Expressway]] to the west of the park and [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Route 9]] north of the park. One of the first tenants in the park was [[Luz Industries]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elr-arc.com/english/portfolio/luz.html New Headquarters for Luz Industries, Jerusalem]&lt;/ref&gt; an early pioneer of [[Solar thermal energy]], which in the 1980s built the world's largest solar energy generating facility [[SEGS]] in the [[Mojave Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solar.co.il/blog/ Solar Energy in Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major international corporation to establish a base at Har Hotzvim was Intel, which opened its Fab 8 semiconductor manufacturing plant in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/jobs/israel/sites/jerusalem.htm Intel Jerusalem profile]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, as Jerusalem was awarded the status of a preferred development zone for the high-tech industry, an expansion plan was initiated by the [[Jerusalem Development Authority]]. The expansion took place in three stage (known as Har Hotzvim stage b, c and d) and by the mid 2000s most of the available plots have been developed.

In 2005, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries opened a new, state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in Har Hotzvim, at a cost of [[US$]]80 million. It initially produced about 4 billion tablets a year, rising to 8 billion a year when the second phase of building was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gavison|first=Yoram|title=Teva unveils new plant in Jerusalem: Teva invests 80 million dollars in the plant|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/teva-unveils-new-plant-in-jerusalem-1.169631|newspaper=Haaretz|date=2005-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Intel closed its aging Fab 8 chip plant and started converting the facility to a [[die preparation]] plant. The plant was inaugurated in November  2009; the company planned to operate it on Saturdays in accordance with its business needs, requiring continuous operation of the production line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Intel to open Jerusalem plant next week|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/11/08/intel-israel-idUSL848877220091108|newspaper=Reuters|date=Nov 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This angered the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] community living in nearby religious neighborhoods, who strictly observe the Sabbath laws. For several weeks they gathered every Saturday outside the building; some threw rocks at the building and the police. Eventually representatives of the Haredi community reached an agreement with Intel to keep the plant open on Saturdays, but allow only non-Jews to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Intel to remain open on Sabbath in Jerusalem: Protests by ultra-Orthodox Jews turn violent at chipmaker’s facility|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33949421/ns/business-world_business/t/intel-remain-open-sabbath-jerusalem/|newspaper=Associated Press|date=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011  Haredi [[United Torah Judaism]] party in the Jerusalem city council proposed to clear the area for new residential development for their community, an offer that was firmly rejected by Jerusalem's mayor [[Nir Barkat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Azulai|first=Yuval|title=Haredim want Jerusalem high-tech park for housing|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000664499&amp;fid=1124|newspaper=Globes|date=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 19114 Geographic information - Quality evaluation procedures''' provides a procedural framework for evaluating the quality of digital geographic datasets, consistent with the data quality principles defined in ISO 19113. It consists of three classes of conformance: one for quality evaluation, one for evaluating data quality and on for reporting quality information. It is an [[international standard]] developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]].

'''Kwahu''' is an Akan group and area, dubbed [[Asaase Aban]] or the natural fortress, in view of its national position  as the highest habitable elevation. Kwahu lies in the Eastern Region of [[Ghana]], on the west shore of [[Lake Volta]]. They share the region with their fellow Akans the Akyems, the Adangbe-Krobos and a small sect of  migrant Ewes in the Afram Plains area who double as fishing experts and caretakers in the waterfront zone.  There are two common spellings of the name, Kwawu and Kwahu.  The "w" spelling is the official spelling from the African Studies Centre, [[University of Ghana]], and more resembles the pronunciation. The "h" was put in by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[missionaries]] from [[Basel]], who added the "h" to ensure that Kwa, the first syllable, was not pronounced as "eh."  The "h" is not separately pronounced in the name. For Anglo-Germanic speakers, [[Ku-A-U]] may be an easier pronunciation help whilst Franco-Roman natives would say [[KoU-AoU]] with ease.

The term Kwahu also refers to the variant of [[Akan languages|Akan language]] spoken in this region and to the Kwahu people who come from the region, there are about 1,000,000 Kwahus. Except for a few variations in stress, pronunciation and syntax, there are no markers in the dialect spoken by the Kwahus, who are originally of Ashanti stock, having separated and then migrated from the Sekyere-Efiduase-Mampong area to their present settlement, joining a few others from Akyem and other ancestral Ashanti heartland.

 The Mamponghene, who is next to the Ashanti King in hierarchy, and the Kwahuhene, are historically  cousins, hence both occupy Silver Stools with the salutation of Daasebre.

The name derives from its myths of origin, "The slave (akoa) died (wu)," which was based on an ancient prophecy that a slave would die so the wandering tribe of [[Akan people|Akan]] would know where to settle.  The myth was part of the historical stories of the Agona matriclan, the first paramount lineage of Kwawu, and was later adopted by the Bretuao-Tena matriclan (Twidan) who later replaced them.

The paramount king and the royal matrilineage of the Kwawu reside at Abene, north of Abetifi on the banks of the highlands. The strategic location of Abene and a dreaded militia that guarded the route was led by Akwamu warriors who fiercely repelled attempts by colonial forces to capture the Omanhene. Even today, the road from Abetifi to the small enclave housing the king is plied with some unease, given the stories recounted . 

Until their leaders seized upon the opportunities presented with the Bond of 1844, Kwahu was thus an integral part of Ashanti Kingdom and attested by available maps of the period. It is also worthy of note: Ashanti waged punitive and protracted wars against fellow Akans including Denkyira, Akwamu, Akyem, Fanti, Assin but never fought Kwahu.
Abetifi (Tena matriclan) is the head of the Adonten (vanguard).
Obo (Aduana, Ada, Amoakade) is the head of the Nifa (Right Division)
Aduamoa (Dwumena, Asona) is the head of the Benkum (Left Division).
Pepease is the head of the Kyidom or rear guard division. 

As part of the [[Ashanti Confederacy|Asante Empire]], Kwawu had an Asante emissary, governor or ambassador at Atibie, next to [[Mpraeso]], of the Ekuona matriclan). To indicate its independence from Asante in 1888 the Kwawu assassinated the Asante emissary in Atibe, about the time of the arrival of the Basel missionaries from Switzerland.  Fritz Ramseyer, enroute to Kumasi with his captors, had been granted a few days of rest during a stop at Kwahu and recovered quickly from a bout of fever in the mountains. Upon gaining his freedom later from the Asantehene, he sought permission to build a Christian Mission in Abetifi, thereby placing the town on the world map and opening the area to vocational and evangelical opportunities. Obo, traditionally pro-Ashanti, led the opposition to the Swiss. It is orally told that the Kwahus chose Obo as their financial center.

In recent years, Kwahu has become the best place to celebrate [[Easter]]. Many from far away places within the borders of the country and even beyond go there to enjoy themselves. The Kwahu mountains offer an ideal spot for [[Paraglide]]rs to showcase their skills to the public and to share the thrills of gliding. Such events also serve as [[Tourist|Tourist Attractions]] sites and generates income for the [[Ghana|Ghanaian Economy]]. Characteristics of Kwahu natives are centred on economics, self-sufficiency and an incredible ability to forego short-term or immediate wants in planning for longer-term goals; they are natural-born entrepreneurs.

Trivia: Experts in thrift, the Kwahus surprise with relative success where others fail in any manner of business, from cocoa farming to house front trading and modern service sector or manufacturing industries.
 As a result, they are often thought to be wealth-creating magicians.

Until recently, they shunned political activism and are arguably under-represented in government appointments, compared with other Akan groups such as Ashanti, Fanti, Brong or Akyem.

Kwahus often wish to spend the retirement years in their mountainous home region and are more likely to marry from their tribal group and invest in a magnificent home. Choice of spouse outside the group often will depend on strategic business calculations and a willingness of the partner to relocate at old age.

Kwahus get along relatively well with others but may have special relations with the Ga of Accra who initially welcomed and supported their businesses in the post independence era. A considerable population of Northern migrants and Ewes permanently reside in Kwahu, exercising caretaker functions on lands and farms  as their hosts move into the metropolitan areas to engage in micro Start-ups.

[[File:Shanker.jpg|thumb|Lazimpat Durbar, from which the neighborhood got its name, is now a hotel]]
'''Lazimpat''' ({{lang-ne|लाजिम्पाट}}) is a residential area of [[Kathmandu]], the capital city of [[Nepal]]. It is close to the [[Narayanhity Palace]], and is well known in Kathmandu for its hotels, restaurants, schools, colleges, embassies and department stores. The neigborhood's name derives from [[Lazimpat Durbar]], that lies in its vicinity and was converted into [[Hotel Shanker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=JBR|first=PurushottamShamsher|date=2007 |title=Ranakalin Pramukh Atihasik Darbarharu|trans-title=Chief Historical Palaces of the Rana Era|language=Nepali|location= |publisher=Vidarthi Pustak Bhandar|isbn=978-9994611027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lazimpat shares one border with [[Thamel]], a popular tourist hub, and another with [[Baluwatar, Kathmandu|Baluwatar]], a reputed residential area where the Prime Minister, Chief Justice, and the Chairman of Constitution Assembly reside. Lazimpat is just 20 minutes away from what is downtown of Kathmandu, Newroad and Ason. 

There has been a recent upsurge in the construction activity in the region. Lazimpat boasts the only road connecting the northern part of the Kathmandu valley with the southern part. The roads are very busy, yet until a few years back, there was not much economic activity in the region. Luxury hotels, photo studios, department stores and corner shops have been a special feature of Lazimpat. It is centrally located and is also home to or nearby various embassies.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

There are many hotels, such as Hotel Shanker and [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel Nepal]], restaurants and sweet shops situated in Lazimpat among vaious shopping outlets.

Embassies in Lazimpat include the Indian Embassy, the British Embassy, the Israeli Embassy, the French Embassy and the Danish Embassy, but also Nepalese governmental offices, such as the [[Inland Revenue Department (Nepal)|Inland Revenue Department]] have their premises in the neighborhood.

The following organisations have their headquarters in Lazimpat:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11404">This is a '''list of countries by oil production''', as compiled from the [[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] database for calendar year 2016, tabulating all countries on a comparable best-estimate basis. Compared with shorter-term data, the full-year figures are less prone to distortion from periodic maintenance shutdowns and other seasonal cycles. The volumes in the table represent [[crude oil]] and [[lease condensate]], the hydrocarbon liquids collected at or near the wellhead. The volumes in the table do not include [[biofuel]]. They also do not include the increase in liquid volumes during oil refining ("refinery gain"), or liquids separated from natural gas in gas processing plants ([[natural gas liquids]]).&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/data/browser/#/?pa=00000000000000000000000000000000002&amp;c=ruvvvvvfvtvnvv1vrvvvvfvvvvvvfvvvou20evvvvvvvvvvvvuvo&amp;ct=0&amp;tl_id=5-A&amp;vs=INTL.57-1-AFG-TBPD.A&amp;vo=0&amp;v=H&amp;start=2014&amp;end=2016 |title=Production of Crude Oil including Lease Condensate 2016 |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |format=CVS download |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Under this definition, total world oil production in 2016 averaged 80,622,000 [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] per day. Approximately 68% came from the top ten countries, and an overlapping 44% came from the fourteen current [[OPEC]] members, highlighted with blue shading in the table below.

The top three producers have in recent history been (alphabetically) [[Russia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United States]]. Each of these countries experienced major production declines at different times in the past, but since 2014 all three have been producing near their peak rates of 9 to 11 million barrels per day.&lt;ref name=TopTrend&gt;{{cite web |date=25 May 2017 |title=Monthly Energy Review |at=Figure 11.1a |url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/archive/00351705.pdf |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and Russia also top the [[List of countries by oil exports|list of oil exporting countries]], while Russia is not a member of [[OPEC]]. The monthly [[Petroleum in the United States|U.S. oil production]] reached 10.07 million b/d in November 2017, the highest monthly level of crude oil production in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=35632 U.S. production of crude oil grew 5% in 2017, likely leading to record 2018 production] [[Energy Information Administration|U.S. Energy Information Administration]], 4 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2018, the U.S. government forecast the country will become a net oil and gas exporter by 2022, the first time since 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/united-states-will-be-a-net-energy-exporter.html US will be a net energy exporter by 2022, four years sooner than expected, Energy Department says] CNBC, 7 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2028">The '''local border traffic''' or '''small border traffic''' is the cross-border traffic of the residents of the [[border area]]. In many cases local border traffic is subject to bilateral regulation aimed at the simplification of border crossing for these residents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steve Peers]], ''EU Justice and Home Affairs Law'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=X0YlF7X1mlgC&amp;pg=PA210 p. 210]&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, additional [[border crossing point]]s are created to carry only local (small) border traffic.

The [[European Union]] rules on local border traffic were established by Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32011R1342:EN:NOT Regulation (EU) No 1342/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 as regards the inclusion of the Kaliningrad oblast and certain Polish administrative districts in the eligible border area]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- more immediate refs required --&gt;

'''Louise Arner Boyd''' (September 16, 1887 – September 14, 1972) was an [[United States|American]] [[explorer]] of [[Greenland]] and the [[Arctic]], who wrote extensively of her explorations, and in 1955 became the first woman to fly over the [[North Pole]] privately chartering a [[DC-4]] and crew that included aviation pioneer [[Thor Solberg]].

==Biography==
Born in [[San Rafael, California]] to John Franklin Boyd (part-owner of the Bodie gold mine) and Louise Cook Arner, Louise grew up in [[Marin County, California|Marin County]] and the hills of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] playing and competing with her two older brothers, Seth and John.  The Boyds were leading citizens of the era and their children's early years, though privileged and relatively carefree, included a well-rounded education that was punctuated every summer by an extended stay on their ranch in the [[Oakland Hills, Oakland, California|Oakland Hills]]. It was here where Louise and her brothers rode horses, explored [[Mount Diablo]], fished, hunted, camped, and generally led a rugged and adventurous life.  When Louise was a teenager, both of her brothers died from heart disease within a few months of each other. Her parents were devastated and began to lean heavily on Louise for care and comfort. It was at this time that the Boyds bequeathed to the City of San Rafael their former gatehouse and some of the family property as a memorial to their two sons. The [[Victorian house|Victorian-style]] building is now offices for the City of San Rafael. After her brother's deaths, Louise traveled extensively with her parents making numerous trips to Europe. In the spring of 1919, Louise took a train to Buffalo, N.Y., purchased a touring car and drove across the United States at a time when there was no highway system and roads were often gravel and dirt. This would be the first of many cross-country trips that she would take and detail in her many journals. Upon her parents death in 1919 and 1920, Louise inherited the family fortune after caring for her parents in the last few years of their lives.

With her inheritance, Louise Boyd could control her own destiny and indulge her intrepid spirit developed during her active California childhood. She began to travel in the early 1920s, and on a trip to [[Norway]] in 1924 she cruised out to sea and saw the [[Arctic ice pack|Polar Ice Pack]] for the first time. This experience proved instrumental in her life and she immediately began planning her own Arctic adventure. In 1925, she was presented to the King and Queen of England and soon after, in 1926, she chartered the supply ship ''Hobby'' which had been used by famous explorer [[Roald Amundsen]], for a hunting and filming trip to the Arctic accompanied by her friends the Count &amp; Countess [[Ribadavia]]. She gained international notoriety for her exploits (and hunting of polar bears) and was dubbed by newspapers around the world, as the, “Arctic Diana” and “The Girl Who Tamed the Arctic”.

[[Image:Ds-hobby.png|thumb|left|Boyd chartered the ''Hobby'', a supply ship of [[Tromsø]] for her trips in 1926 and 1928]]
In 1928, Boyd was planning a second pleasure trip aboard the ''Hobby'' when it was learned that the famous [[Norway|Norwegian]] explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] had recently disappeared in his own attempt to find and rescue the [[Italy|Italian]] explorer [[Umberto Nobile]]. Louise offered her services and the ship to the Norwegian government to search for Amundsen, saying, “How could I go on a pleasure trip when those 22 lives were at stake?” Although she traveled about 10,000 miles (16,100&amp;nbsp;km) across the [[Arctic Ocean]] she found no trace of him.  Nevertheless, the Norwegian government awarded her the Chevalier Cross of the Order of Saint Olav. "She was the first American woman to receive the order and the third woman in the world to be so honored." (1)

Boyd is primarily known for leading a series of scientific expeditions to the east and north coast of Greenland in the 1930s. Louise photographed, surveyed and collected hundreds of botanical specimens, having corresponded and learned from her good friend, Alice Eastwood of the California Academy of Sciences. The American Geographical Society published her findings and photographs from the 1933 and 1935 expeditions in a book titled ''The Fiord Region of East Greenland''.  An area near the De Geer Glacier was later named Louise Boyd Land.

In August 1934, after being elected as a delegate to the [[International Geographical Congress]] in Warsaw, Poland, Louise set out on a 3-month journey across the Polish countryside photographing and recording the customs, dress, economy and culture of the many ethnic Poles, Ukrainians, Byelorussians and Lithuanians. The journey, by car, rail, boat and on foot took her first from [[Lviv]] to [[Kovel]] (these towns are in [[Ukraine]] today), and then to [[Kobrin]] – [[Pinsk]] – [[Kletsk]] – [[Nesvizh]] – [[Slonim]] (these towns are in [[Belarus]] today). She finished the journey in [[Vilnius|Vilno]]. Her travel narrative was supplemented with over 500 photographs and published by the American Geographical Society in 1937 as ''Polish Countrysides''.&lt;ref name="Pol_Trip"&gt;American Geographical Society Special Publication No. 20 “Polish Countrysides” Photographs And Narrative by Louise A. Boyd with a contribution by Stanislaw Gorzuchowski, New York, American Geographical Society Broadway at 156th Street, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of World War II, the knowledge she had gained in the course of her six previous expeditions to Greenland and the Arctic became of strategic significance and sensitivity. The United States government requested that she not publish the book she was writing about her later 1937 and 1938 expeditions and asked her to lead, for the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]], a geophysical expedition along the west coast of Greenland and down the coast of [[Baffin Island]] and [[Labrador]]. She was appointed as the Bureau's consulting expert on a dollar a year basis. At her own expense, she chartered and outfitted  the schooner [[Effie M. Morrissey]]. This schooner, owned and commanded by captain [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]], had been successfully running yearly scientific expeditions to the Arctic since 1926. The principal purpose of the 1941 Bureau of Standards expedition was to obtain data on radio-wave transmission in the Arctic regions traversed. The ionosphere, geomagnetism and aurorae were studied. The Effie M. Morrissey  sailed from Washington DC on June 11, 1941, with Louise Boyd leading a scientific party of four men (including a physician) and a crew of eleven under the command of Capt. Bartlett. The expedition returned to Washington DC on November 3, 1941 with valuable data.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce, ''Technical News Bulletin of the National Bureau of Standards, Washington'', December 1941, Number 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the remainder of the war, Boyd worked on secret assignments for the U.S. Department of the Army and she was awarded, in 1949, a Department of Army Certificate of Appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Woman Explorer Honored by Army.

Woodruff, commander of the First Army, made the presentation in his office at Governors Island. ... |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 19, 1949 |accessdate=2011-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her earlier book that had been held from publication, ''The Coast of Northeast Greenland'', was published after the war, in 1948.

Later in life Louise Boyd was an active and well-known Marin figure and hostess while serving as a member of the Executive Committee of the [[San Francisco Symphony]]. She also accumulated many academic honors receiving an honorary law degree from the University of California, Berkeley and from Mills College. She was also the second woman ever to receive the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090316051629/http://amergeog.org/awards_program.htm Cullum Medal] of the American Geographical Society and in 1960 was the first woman to be elected to their board. She was also made an honorary member of the [[California Academy of Science]]. Near the end of her life, Louise experienced financial difficulties and had already spent much of her fortune outfitting and chartering her many explorations. Eventually she had to sell the family home in San Rafael and all her furniture. She died in San Francisco on September 14, 1972.

The present day [http://www.marinhistory.org/ Marin History Museum] is located in the old Boyd Estate Gatehouse in San Rafael, California and features a permanent exhibition of Louise Boyd photographs, memorabilia and information.

The '''Map Collectors' Circle''' was founded in [[London]] in April 1963 by [[R V Tooley|Ronald Vere Tooley]] with a stated aim of "stimulating interest in and publish material on early printed [[map]]s, [[atlas]]es, [[cartographer]]s, etc."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Map collector's series, Volume 1 | publisher = Map Collectors' Circle | year = 1964 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VvgRAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Map+Collectors%27+Circle+is+to+stimulate+interest+in+and%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1963 and 1975, it set about fulfilling its second mandate with a series of 110 [[monograph]]s related to the field of historical cartography which remain of interest to cartographers for their breadth.&lt;ref name="MCCSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapforum.com/05/mcc.htm|title=Index to The Map Collectors' Circle Series|last=Dryburgh|first=Paula|publisher=[[Bodleian Library]], Map Section|accessdate=2009-10-24|location=[[Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An index to the series has been created by the [[Bodleian Library]] Map Section.

The '''Montagne des Français Reserve''' ([[French language|French]] for: ''mountain of the [[French people|French]]'') is a [[protected area]] consisting principally of dry deciduous forest in northern [[Madagascar]]. It is part of the larger Ramena protected area complex which also includes [[Orangea Reserve]] and the [[Ambodivahibe Marine Reserve]].  These three protected areas are currently being created and will be designated in 2008.

[[File:Diego bay.JPG|thumb|240px|left|The summit of Montagne des Français provides views of the Bay of Diego, the city of Antsiranana and Nosy Lonjo]]
The Montagne des Français reserve protects deciduous dry forest characteristic of the north of Madagascar.  Much of the forest is on a calcareous massif that has been eroded into [[karst]] formations known locally as Antsingy.  The forested area ranges from 100–450 metres above sea level.  This mountain is thought to receive more rain than the surrounding area (Antsiranana receives approximately 1000mm precipitation annually) which explains the lush vegetation in an otherwise very dry bioclimatic zone.  Preliminary botanical and zoological inventories have been done that show these forests are rich in both fauna and flora and include a remarkable number of local and regional [[endemism|endemic]] species.  In particular this is one of the best places to see one of the most beautiful baobabs, ''Adansonia suarezensis'' as well as an aloe, ''Aloe suarezensis'', both of which are restricted to this area of northern Madagascar.  Other locally endemic plants of interest include the flame tree, ''Delonix regia'', the rare ''Diegodendron humbertii'' that is the only representative of the family [[Diegodendronaceae]] and known from only a few dozen individuals, and ''Baudouina solleyformis'', which is used locally as a traditional protection against [[witchcraft]].  To date,{{when|date=November 2017}} 242 species from 58 families and 158 genera have been described from the Montagne des Français; the five most important families that account for over 40% of the species are the [[Rubiaceae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Malvaceae]], [[Euphorbiaceae]] and [[Sapindaceae]].

Zoological surveys to date have identified 19 species of amphibian, 52 reptile species, 56 birds and 21 mammals.  Of the [[herpetofauna]], eight species are endemic to the Montagne des Français, 28 are regional endemics, 2 are listed as globally threatened in [[IUCN|IUCN's]] 2006 [[Red List]] and 14 species are [[CITES]] listed.

The main threats to the Montagne des Français are linked to demand for wood-based products from the nearby city of [[Antsiranana]].  Logging for timber and charcoal production are the main threats. Unlike most of Madagascar, slash and burn agriculture is not a major threat since most of the remaining forest is on land unsuitable for agriculture.

[[File:Adansonia suarezensis.jpg|thumb|360px|left|The shiny brown bark of Adansonia suarezensis distinguishes this regional endemic from other baobab species]]
Several other karst limestone areas are also protected in Madagascar including [[Tsingy de Bemaraha]], [[Namoroka National Park|Tsingy de Namoroka]] and the [[Ankarana Reserve|Tsingy d’Ankarana]] reserve 100&amp;nbsp;km to the south of Montagne des Français.  The current effort to create a new reserve in the Montagne des Francais involves many local organizations and is being headed up by the local regional government with technical support and funding from [[Conservation International]].

==Tourism==
The Montagne des Francais is accessible from the city of Antsiranana (also known as Diego Suarez).  The base of a trail leading to the summit can be reached approximately 12&amp;nbsp;km by road from Antsiranana; a guide is recommended.{{fact|date=November 2017}} The trail to the summit takes approximately 2 hours and several viewpoints along the way and at the summit provide views over the Diego Bay.{{fact|date=November 2017}} The remains of several fortifications dating from the French colonial period can still be seen.  These fortifications and the whole area around Diego were the scene of fierce fighting during World War II between the Vichy French occupiers and British forces.

'''Mýrdalssandur''' ({{IPA-is|'mirˌtals'sanˌtur|lang}}) is an [[outwash plain]] on the south coast of [[Iceland]].

==Location and description==
The outwash plain is located between the rivers of [[Kúðafljót]] in the east and [[Múlakvísl]] in the west. Both rivers carry water from the [[Mýrdalsjökull]] glacier to the sea.

Mýrdalssandur has a {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}}-long coast line, including [[Kötlutangi]], the southernmost point of the island of Iceland.

The [[Route 1 (Iceland)|Ring Road]] crosses this flat surface on {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

==Development==
The outwash plain was built by the numerous [[jökulhlaup]]s of the [[Mýrdalsjökull]]. The last large jökulhlaup was due to an explosive eruption of the [[Katla (volcano)|Katla]] volcano under the glacier in 1918, and the water volume at the peak of the jökulhlaup was estimated to be around 200,000 - 300,000 m³/s.

==History of settlements==
South of the road rises [[Hjörleifshöfði]] to a height of {{convert|231|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountain is named after [[Hjörleifur Hródmarsson]]. He was the first settler to come to Iceland with [[Ingólfr Arnarson]].

In the Middle Ages there was a fishing lake called Kerlingarfjörðer at the mouth of the [[Múlakvísl]]. Probably it was not a fjord, but rather an extension of a river mouth. The name (isl. Kerling = the old woman) was created according to the land register book, after an old woman had fallen overboard from one of the settler ships and was carried away by the water.&lt;ref&gt;W. Schutzbach: Katla. Sögu Kötluelda. Reykjavík 2005, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 1000 many farms seem to have found themselves on the Mýrdalssandur. Sources mention four parishes in {{interlanguage link|Álftaver|is}}. These farms were, however, were mostly abandoned up to the 15th century, as a result of volcanic eruptions of the Katla, subsequent glacier runs and ashfall.&lt;ref&gt;Schutzbach, ibid., p. 20ff.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 21st century, some farms still exist in Álftaver.

==Þykkvabær Monastery==
In 1168 a monks' monastery of the [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]]s was founded in the Þykkvabær í Veri on the Mýrdalssandur. The name was then changed to {{interlanguage link|Þykkvabæjarklaustur|is}} and the first abbot there was [[Saint Thorlak]]. He was later bishop in [[Skálholt]] and some of his successors were either bishops there or in [[Hólar]].

In 1550, with the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the [[Christian III of Denmark|King of Denmark]] took over the monastery with all its possessions. The monastery was dissolved, but it still existed for a long time as a rich farm until it was finally abandoned in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Schutzbach, ibid., p. 25ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The area was used as a [[filming location]] for the ''[[Star Wars]]'' spinoff film ''[[Rogue One]]'', representing the planet Lah'mu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/p/5-rogue-one-real-filming-locations/4139357|title=5 'Rogue One' Filming Locations You Can Visit On Vacation|work=Movie Pilot|date=12 December 2016|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the opening scenes of the film.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16736">The '''naming of the Americas''', or '''America''' occurred shortly after [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyage to the [[Americas]] in 1492. It is generally accepted that the name derives from [[Amerigo Vespucci]], the Italian explorer, who explored the new continents in the following years. However, some have suggested other explanations, including being named after a mountain range in Nicaragua, or after [[Richard Amerike]] of [[Bristol]].

==Usage==

In modern English, North and South America are generally considered separate continents, and taken together are called ''the Americas'' in the plural, parallel to similar situations such as [[the Carolinas]]. When conceived as a unitary continent, the form is generally ''the continent of America'' in the singular. However, without a clarifying context, singular ''America'' in English commonly refers to the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name=oxfordc&gt;"America." ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'' ({{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}). McArthur, Tom, ed., 1992. New York: Oxford University Press, p. 33: "[16c: from the feminine of ''Americus'', the Latinized first name of the explorer Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512). The name ''America'' first appeared on a map in 1507 by the German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller, referring to the area now called Brazil]. Since the 16c, a name of the western hemisphere, often in the plural ''Americas'' and more or less synonymous with ''the New World''. Since the 18c, a name of the United States of America. The second sense is now primary in English:&amp;nbsp;... However, the term is open to uncertainties:&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earliest use of name==

[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|left|World map of [[Martin Waldseemüller|Waldseemüller]] (Germany, 1507), which first used the name America (in the lower-left section, over South America)&lt;ref name=LoCmap /&gt;]]

The earliest known use of the name ''America'' dates to April 25, 1507, where it was applied to what is now known as South America.&lt;ref name=LoCmap&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/gmd:@field%28NUMBER+@band%28g3200+ct000725C%29%29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109175922/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem%2Fgmd%3A%40field%28NUMBER+%40band%28g3200+ct000725C%29%29|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 9, 2009|title=Universalis cosmographia secundum Ptholomaei traditionem et Americi Vespucii alioru[m]que lustrationes.|publisher=|accessdate=September 8, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It appears on a small globe map with twelve time zones, together with the largest [[Waldseemüller map|wall map]] made to date, both created by the German [[cartographer]] [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2003626426 | title=Universalis cosmographia secundum Ptholomaei traditionem et Americi Vespucii alioru[m]que lustrationes. | publisher=Library of Congress | location=Washington, DC | author=Martin Waldseemüller | LCCN = 2003626426 | accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first maps to show the Americas as a land mass separate from Asia. An accompanying book, ''[[Cosmographiae Introductio]]'', anonymous but apparently written by Waldseemüller's collaborator [[Matthias Ringmann]],&lt;ref name=Smiths&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Toby Lester |first1 = December |year = 2009 | title = Putting America on the Map | url = | journal = Smithsonian | volume = 40 |page = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; states, "I do not see what right any one would have to object to calling this part [that is, the South American mainland], after Americus who discovered it and who is a man of intelligence, Amerigen, that is, the Land of Americus, or America: since both Europa and Asia got their names from women".

==Amerigo Vespucci==

''Americus Vesputius'' was the [[Latin]]ized version of the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s name, the forename being an old [[Italianization]] (compare modern Italian [[Enrico]]) of [[Medieval Latin]] ''Emericus'' (see [[Saint Emeric of Hungary]]), from the Germanic forenames [[Amalric]] and [[Emmerich (name)|Emmerich]] (however, the [[Old High German]] name ''[[Haimirich]]'' may also be a source), from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*amal'' (“vigor, bravery”) or ''*heim'' ("home") + ''*rik'' (“ruler”).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kc60WqxYK4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=henry+amalric+etymology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCtMn9gIHSAhVX9WMKHffhBQEQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=henry%20amalric%20etymology&amp;f=false|title=Surnames of the United Kingdom: A Concise Etymological Dictionary|last=Harrison|first=Henry|date=2017-02-08|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|isbn=9780806301716|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amerigo Vespucci (March 9, 1454{{spaced ndash}}February 22, 1512) was an Italian [[explorer]], [[financier]], [[navigator]] and [[cartographer]] who first postulated{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} that [[Brazil]] and the [[West Indies]] did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts as initially conjectured from [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Columbus' voyages]], but instead constituted an entirely separate landmass hitherto unknown to the Europeans.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Vespucci was apparently unaware of the use of his name to refer to the new landmass, as Waldseemüller's maps did not reach Spain until a few years after his death.&lt;ref name=Smiths /&gt; Ringmann may have been misled into crediting Vespucci by the widely published Soderini Letter, a sensationalized version of one of Vespucci's actual letters reporting on the mapping of the South American coast, which glamorized his discoveries and implied that he had recognized that South America was a continent separate from Asia; in fact, it is not known what Vespucci believed on this count,{{Inconsistent|reason=Earlier we say declaratively (unsourced) that Vespucci &amp;quot;demonstrated that Brazil and the West Indies did not represent Asia's eastern outskirts&amp;quot;. He did, or he may have, or we don't know?}} and he may have died believing, like Columbus, that he had reached the East Indies in Asia rather than a new continent.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8328878.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Magazine &amp;#124; The map that changed the world |publisher=BBC News |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain officially refused to accept the name ''America'' for two centuries, saying that Columbus should get credit, and Waldseemüller's later maps, after Ringmann's death, did not include it; however, usage was established when [[Gerardus Mercator]] applied the name to the entire New World in his 1538 world map. Acceptance may have been aided by the "natural poetic counterpart" that the name ''America'' made with ''Asia, Africa,'' and ''Europa''.&lt;ref name=Smiths /&gt;

== Named after a Nicaraguan mountain range ==
In 1875, [[Jules Marcou]] suggested that the name America derives from indigenous American languages where "[[Amerrique]]" originally named a prominent mountain range in present-day [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AtlanticMonthly-1875mar-00291?View=PDFPages|title="Origin of the Name America" by Jules Marcou, The Atlantic Monthly, March 1875|website=UNZ.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this view, Native speakers shared this indigenous word with Columbus and members of his crew, and Columbus made landfall in the vicinity of these mountains on his fourth voyage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/AtlanticMonthly-1875mar-00291?View=PDFPages|title="Origin of the Name America" by Jules Marcou, The Atlantic Monthly, March 1875|website=UNZ.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Naming of America"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html|title=The Naming of America|website=www.uhmc.sunysb.edu|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name America then spread via oral means throughout Europe relatively quickly even reaching the cartographer [[Martin Waldseemüller|Waldseemüller]] who was &amp;nbsp;preparing a map of newly reported lands for publication in 1507.&lt;ref name="The Naming of America"/&gt; [[Martin Waldseemüller|Waldseemüller]]'s work in the area of denomination takes on a different aspect in this view:&lt;blockquote&gt;The baptismal passage in the&amp;nbsp;''Cosmographiae Introductio''&amp;nbsp;has commonly been read as argument, in which the author said that he was naming the newly discovered continent in honor of Vespucci and saw no reason for objections. But, as etymologist Joy Rea has suggested, it could also be read as an explanation, in which he indicates that he has heard the New World was called America, and the only explanation lay in Vespucci's name.&lt;ref name="The Naming of America"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[Bristol]] [[antiquarian]] [[Alfred Hudd]] suggested in 1908 that the name was derived from the surname "Amerike" or "ap Meryk" and was used on early British maps that have since been lost. Richard ap Meryk, anglicised to [[Richard Amerike]] (or Ameryk) ({{circa}} 1445–1503) was a wealthy English merchant, royal customs officer and [[sheriff]] of Bristol.&lt;ref name="BBC Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/tudors/americaname_01.shtml#three |title=BBC History in Depth; The Naming of America; Richard Amerike |author=Macdonald, Peter |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=24 February 2011|date=17 February 2011 |work=BBC History website}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some historians, he was the principal owner of the ''[[Matthew (ship)|Matthew]]'', the ship sailed by [[John Cabot]] during his voyage of exploration to North America in 1497.&lt;ref name="BBC Hist"/&gt; The idea that Richard Amerike was a 'principal supporter' of Cabot has gained popular currency in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="BBC Hist"/&gt;  There is no known evidence to support this.  Similarly, and contrary to a recent tradition that names Amerike as principal owner and main funder of the ''Matthew'', Cabot's ship of 1497,&lt;ref name="BBC Hist"/&gt; academic enquiry does not connect Amerike with the ship. Her ownership at that date remains uncertain.&lt;ref name="Jones merchants"&gt;[http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/CXXI/492/778 Evan T. Jones, "The Matthew of Bristol and the financiers of John Cabot's 1497 voyage to North America", ''English Historical Review'' (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Macdonald asserts that caravel was specifically built for the Atlantic crossing.&lt;ref name=macd29&gt;{{Citation | last = Macdonald | first = Peter | year = 1997 | title = Cabot &amp; the Naming of America | publisher = Petmac Publications | place = Bristol | isbn = 0-9527009-2-1 | p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hudd proposed his theory in a paper which was read at 21 May 1908 meeting of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, and which appeared in Volume 7 of the club's ''Proceedings''. In "Richard Ameryk and the name America," Hudd discussed the 1497 discovery of North America by [[John Cabot]], an Italian who had sailed on behalf of England. Upon his return to England after his first (1497) and second (1498–1499) voyages, Cabot received two pension payments from [[King Henry VII]]. Of the two customs officials at the Port of Bristol who were responsible for handing over the money to Cabot, the more senior was Richard Ameryk ([[High Sheriff of Bristol]] in 1503).&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;{{cite web|title=The Naming of America: Fragments We've Shored Against Ourselves|url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html|work=uhmc.sunysb.edu|publisher=Jonathan Cohen, Stony Brook University|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=macd46&gt;{{harvnb|Macdonald|1997|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hudd postulated that Cabot named the land that he had discovered after Ameryk, from whom he received the pension conferred by the king.&lt;ref name=macd33&gt;{{harvnb|Macdonald|1997|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that Cabot had a reputation for being free with gifts to his friends, such that his expression of gratitude to the official would not be unexpected. Further, Hudd used a quote from a late 15th-century manuscript (a calendar of Bristol events), the original of which had been lost in an 1860 Bristol fire, that indicated the name America was already known in Bristol in 1497.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ameryk&gt;{{cite journal|title=Richard Ameryk and the name America|journal=Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club|volume=VII|url=http://www.cliftonantiquarian.co.uk/CAC_docs/CAC%20Ameryk.pdf|accessdate=11 July 2012|author=((Alfred E. Hudd, F.S.A., Hon. Secretary))|pages=8–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=This year (1497), on St. John the Baptist's day (June 24th), the land of America was found by the merchants of Bristow, in a ship of Bristowe called the 'Mathew,' the which said ship departed from the port of Bristowe the 2nd of May and came home again the 6th August following.&lt;ref name=ameryk/&gt;}} Hudd reasoned that the scholars of the 1507 ''Cosmographiae Introductio'', unfamiliar with Richard Ameryk, assumed that the name America, which he claimed had been in use for ten years, was based on Amerigo Vespucci and, therefore, mistakenly transferred the honour from Ameryk to Vespucci.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ameryk/&gt; While Hudd's speculation has found support from some authors, there is no strong evidence to substantiate his theory that Cabot named America after Richard Ameryk.&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Hist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quinn"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=David B.|authorlink1=David Beers Quinn|title=Explorers and Colonies: America, 1500-1625|date=1990|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9781852850241|page=398|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P7OuMkzGKw0C&amp;pg=PA398&amp;dq=hudd+america&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnzaufp_LKAhVMVhQKHfCoBEQQ6AEIQzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=hudd%20america&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, because Amerike's coat of arms was similar to the flag later adopted by the independent United States, a legend grew that the North American continent had been named for him rather than for Amerigo Vespucci.&lt;ref name="BBC Hist"/&gt; It is not widely accepted.

==Native naming of the continent==

Naming the continent after a European colonizer is seen by some civil society groups as problematic. In 1977, the World Council of Indigenous Peoples (Consejo Mundial de Pueblos Indígenas) proposed using the term [[Abya Yala]] instead of "America" when referring to the continent. There are also names in other indigenous languages such as Ixachilan and Runa Pacha. Some scholars have picked up the term with a reference to the illegitimacy of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Roth2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Roth|title=Latein/Amerika, in: Susan Arndt and Nadja Ofuatey-Alazard: Wie Rassismus aus Wörtern spricht|publisher=Unrast-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reef Check''' is an international [[non-governmental organization]] dedicated to the conservation of two reef [[ecosystems]]: tropical [[coral reef]]s and [[California]]n rocky reefs. The Foundation is headquartered in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]], but uses [[data]] from [[volunteer]] [[scuba diver]] teams in over 80 countries, ranging from [[Australia]], [[Japan]], to even [[Germany]]. It is the [[United Nations]]’ official coral reef monitoring program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reef Check Australia |title=Reef Check Worldwide |url=http://www.reefcheckaustralia.org/about/reef-check-worldwide/index.cfm |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Greg Stolz |title=More checks as coral suffers |url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23485856-3102,00.html |accessdate=2008-06-17 | work=The Courier-Mail | date=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United Nations |title=International Coral Reef Action Network (ICRAN) |url=http://webapps01.un.org/dsd/partnerships/public/partnerships/129.html |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Reef Check first conducted a global survey of coral reef health in 1997. The data confirmed that coral reefs were in crisis due to [[overfishing]], [[pollution]] and other [[human]] [[wiktionary:impact|impact]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hodgson, G. |title=A Global Assessment of Human Effects on Coral Reefs |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=345–355 |year=1999 |url=http://reefcheck.org/about_RC_Reef/publications/mpb.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-17 |doi=10.1016/S0025-326X(99)00002-8 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517225039/http://reefcheck.org/about_RC_Reef/publications/mpb.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The published results in 1999 unsettled the coral biologist community, as the extent of impacts were not realized.

"The Global Coral Reef Crisis: Trends and Solutions (1997-2001)", a five-year report on coral reefs, was released in 2002 at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hodgson G, Liebeler J |title=The Global Coral Reef Crisis: Trends and Solutions (1997-2001) |journal=Reef Check Report |year=2002 |url=http://www.reefcheck.org/about_RC_Reef/publications/Reef%20Check%20Report.pdf/Reef%20Check%205%20Year%20Report.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522124234/http://www.reefcheck.org/about_RC_Reef/publications/Reef%20Check%20Report.pdf/Reef%20Check%205%20Year%20Report.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report used data collected by thousands of volunteers worldwide, and was the first scientific document detailing the decline in coral reef health over a five-year period.

In 2005, Reef Check launched its first [[temperate]] reef program in California.&lt;ref name=Wehrenberg2012&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wehrenberg, ML |author2=Freiwald, J |title=Reef Check California: Applied Ecosystem Monitoring as a Training Tool for AAUS Programs |journal=In: Steller D, Lobel L, eds. Diving for Science 2012. Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Underwater Sciences]] 31st Symposium. Dauphin Island, AL |year=2012 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10298 |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Reef Check conducted 746 reef surveys, ranging from [[Indo-Pacific]] areas, the [[Red Sea]] and [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reef Check |title=Reef Check 2006 Annual Report |journal=2006 Annual Report |year=2006 |url=http://reefcheck.org/PDFs/2006annualreport.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, in a presentation made at the International Coral Reef Symposium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Reef Check Executive Director Gregor Hodgson announced that coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region have largely recovered from the devastating bleaching event that killed up to 90% of corals on some reefs in 1998. He reported that 10 years later, recovery has occurred more quickly and more completely than expected. Caribbean reefs, however, are losing about 3% living coral every four years due to a combination of human impacts.

===Mission and goals===
Reef Check endeavors to create partnerships among communities, [[government agencies]], [[businesses]], [[universities]] and other [[non-profits]]. Reef Check's mission is "to protect and rehabilitate reefs worldwide".

Reef Check's goals are:&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |author=Reef Check |title=About Reef Check |url=http://reefcheck.org/about_RC_Reef/about_us.php |accessdate=2008-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513225827/http://www.reefcheck.org/about_RC_Reef/about_us.php |archivedate=2008-05-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#to educate the public about the value of reef ecosystems and the current crisis affecting marine life
#to create a global network of volunteer teams trained in Reef Check's scientific methods who regularly monitor and report on reef health
#to facilitate collaboration that produces ecologically sound and economically sustainable solutions
#to stimulate local community action to protect remaining pristine reefs and rehabilitate damaged reefs worldwide

==Monitoring methods==
[[Image:Reef check survey buddy pair.png|right|thumb|Divers performing a substrate survey on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] in 2008. Notice the transect tape.]]

Reef Check volunteer divers are trained to study a designated site annually or sometimes quarterly. Underwater surveyors focus chiefly on [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[invertebrates]] ([[benthos]]), along a {{convert|100|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} [[transect]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shuman CS |title=Reef Check California Monitoring Protocol 2007 |journal=Reef Check California Protocol-2007 |year=2007 |url=http://reefcheck.org/PDFs/2007_RC_CA_Protocol.pdf |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reef Check |title=Monitoring Instruction |url=http://reefcheck.org/ecoaction/Monitoring_Instruction.php |accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reef Check |title=Long Term Monitoring |url=http://reefcheck.org/conservation/long_term_monitoring.php |accessdate=2008-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509164752/http://reefcheck.org/conservation/long_term_monitoring.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four spatial [[Replicate (statistics)|replicates]] (spanning {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}}) are studied with three {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} gaps between. The survey is sub-divided to allow paired divers to separately observe [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], [[photograph]] [[macroinvertebrate]]s and impacts, record video, and count [[fishes]]. A site-specific description is also documented.

==Programs==
Reef Check carries out its work through three major programs:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

# EcoAction Program – an education and certification program for kids and adults who want to learn more about the [[ocean]] and take part in protecting reef ecosystems.
# Coral Reef Management Program – a coral reef monitoring and management system that focuses on establishing Marine Protected Areas to conserve coral reefs while encouraging sustainable use of surrounding reefs by local residents.
# Reef Check California – a volunteer monitoring program for California rocky reefs designed to provide data for managers and to build a conservation constituency among California divers.&lt;ref name=Wehrenberg2012/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1023">The '''Royal Danish Geographical Society''' ('''RDGS''', {{lang-da|Det Kongelige Danske Geografiske Selskab}}) is a [[scientific society]] aimed at furthering the knowledge of the [[Earth]] and its inhabitants and to disseminate interest in the science of [[geography]].

It was founded 18 November 1876 on the initiative of Professor E. D. Erslev. The society is based in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].

The society awards the [[Hans Egede Medal]] in silver 'preferably for geographical studies and researches in the Arctic countries'. It was established in 1916 and named after [[Hans Egede]], who was a Danish missionary in Greenland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6912">'''Stephen of Byzantium''', also known as '''Stephanus Byzantinus''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Στέφανος Βυζάντιος}}; fl. 6th century AD), was the author of an important [[Gazetteer|geographical dictionary]] entitled ''Ethnica'' ({{lang|grc|Ἐθνικά}}). Of the dictionary itself only meagre fragments survive, but we possess an [[epitome]] compiled by one '''Hermolaus''', not otherwise identified.

==Life==
[[File:Byzantium550.png|thumb|right|Byzantium during Stephanus lifetime]]
Nothing is known about the life of Stephanus, except that he was a grammarian at [[Constantinople]], and lived after the time of [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]], and before that of [[Justinian II]]. Later writers provide no information about him, but they do note that the work was later reduced to an [[epitome]] by a certain Hermolaus, who dedicated his epitome to Justinian; whether the first or second emperor of that name is meant is disputed, but it seems probable that Stephanus flourished in [[Byzantium]] in the earlier part of the sixth century AD, under [[Justinian I]].

==The ''Ethnica''==
Even as an epitome, the ''Ethnica'' is of enormous value for geographical, [[Greek mythology|mythological]], and [[Ancient Greek religion|religious]] information about [[ancient Greece]]. Nearly every article in the epitome contains a reference to some ancient writer, as an authority for the name of the place. From the surviving fragments, we see that the original contained considerable quotations from ancient authors, besides many interesting particulars, topographical, historical, mythological, and others. Stephanus cites&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Richardson, ''Hispaniae: Spain and the Development of Roman Imperialism, 218-82 BC'': "In four places, the lexicographer Stephanus of Byzantium refers to towns and ... Artemidorus as source, and in three of the four examples cites Polybius.; [https://books.google.com/books?id=RtSV5M3BUwIC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=De+prosodia+catholica+stephanus&amp;hl=el&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20prosodia%20catholica%20stephanus&amp;f=false From political architecture to Stephanus Byzantius]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artemidorus]], [[Polybius]], [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Xenophon]], [[Strabo]] and other writers.

The chief fragments remaining of the original work are preserved by [[Constantine Porphyrogennetos]], ''[[De administrando imperio]]'', ch. 23 (the article ''Ίβηρίαι δύο'') and ''De thematibus'', ii. 10 (an account of Sicily); the latter includes a passage from the comic poet [[Alexis (poet)|Alexis]] on the ''Seven Largest Islands''. Another respectable fragment, from the article ''Δύμη'' to the end of ''Δ'', exists in a manuscript of the [[Fonds Coislin]], the library formed by [[Pierre Séguier]].

The first modern printed edition of the work was that published by the [[Aldine Press]] in Venice, 1502. The complete standard edition is still that of [[Augustus Meineke]] (1849, reprinted at Graz, 1958), and by convention, references to the text use Meineke's page numbers. A new completely revised edition in German is in preparation, however, edited by B. Wyss, C. Zubler, M. Billerbeck, J.F. Gaertner, 2006 onwards, with four volumes already published.

== Background ==
A sustainable landscape is designed to be both attractive and in balance with the local climate and environment and it should require minimal resource inputs. Thus, the design must be “functional, cost-efficient, visually pleasing, environmentally friendly and maintainable" &lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"&gt;Colorado State University Extension. http://www.ext.colostate.edu/Pubs/Garden/07243.html. Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the concept called [[sustainable development]] it pays close attention to the preservation of limited and costly resources, reducing waste and preventing air, water and soil pollution. Landscape Maintenance practices greatly influence the waste produced and the cost of the maintenance itself; such as using electric or gas [[hedge trimmer]]s which degrade plant material rather than using hand shears which create plant longevity, reduce the amount of waste over time, and prevent the misshaping of plant material and eliminates the "Balls and Boxes that unskilled gardeners create.(James Deagan, Prof Cal Poly Pomona Lecture 1980),  In addition, compost, fertilization, grass cycling, pest control measures that avoid or minimize the use of chemicals, [[integrated pest management]], using the right plant in the right place, appropriate use of turf, irrigation efficiency and [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening are all components of sustainable landscaping.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

== Benefits ==
The geographic location can determine what is sustainable due to differences in precipitation and temperature. For example, the [[California Waste Management]] Board emphasizes the link between minimizing environmental damage and maximizing one’s bottom line of urban commercial landscaping companies. In California, the benefits of landscapes often do not outweigh the cost of inputs like water and labor. However, using appropriately selected and properly sited plants may help to ensure that maintenance costs are lower than they otherwise would be due to reduced chemical and water inputs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;California Integrated Waste Management Board. http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Organics/landscaping/ Viewed 11-15-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==
There are several programs in place that are open to participation by various groups.

The Sustainable Sites Initiative, the cooperative effort between the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] and the [[United States Botanic Garden]], began in 2005 and will provide a points-based certification for landscapes, similar to the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] program for buildings operated by the [[Green Building Council]]. The Sustainable Sites Initiative now has a document titled Guidelines and Performance Benchmarks.&lt;ref&gt;The Sustainable Sites Initiative. http://www.sustainablesites.org/report/SSI_Guidelines_Draft_2008.pdf. Viewed 9/23/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The credit system is expected to be completed in 2011.

== Proper design ==
The primary step to landscape design is to do a "sustainability audit". This is similar to a landscape site analysis that is typically performed by landscape designers at the beginning of the design process. Factors such as lot size, house size, local covenants and budgets should be considered. The steps to design include a base plan, site inventory and analysis, construction documents, implementation and maintenance.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt; Of great importance is considerations related to the growing conditions of the site.  These include orientation to the sun, [[soil type]], wind flow, slopes, shade and climate.  The goal of reducing artificial [[irrigation]] (such as preventing irrigation of landscapes leaving the Los Angeles Basin a Desert again), and reducing use of toxic substances and requires proper plant selection for the specific site.

== Composting ==
{{Main|Composting}}
Composting is a way to recycle kitchen and garden waste while creating inexpensive organic fertilizer for the garden and landscape. Earthworms, microbes and other soil microorganisms feast on such organic matter when provided adequate nitrogen and proper temperatures and moisture. The ideal size for a compost pile or bin is one cubic yard (3' x 3' x 3'). It should be placed in a partly shady location to avoid intense sun and drying out, as this will delay the decomposition process. The pile heats up during the decomposition process, then cools as material is transformed; this is a good time to turn the pile, so that uncomposed materials on the periphery of the pile can be moved to the center to complete the process. With adequate moisture, nitrogen, proper temperature and correct timing of turning the pile, compost can be made in about a 30-day period. Left alone this process will still occur, but may take three to four months under less-than-ideal conditions.

Compost can be added as an amendment to poorly draining soil, as a fertilizer on flower and vegetable beds, to fruit trees or used as a potting soil for potted plants. Trimmings from lawns, trees and shrubs from a large landscape site can be used as feedstock for on-site composting. Reusing on-site organic materials will decrease the need for purchasing other soil additives.

== Irrigation ==
[[Mulch]] may be used to reduce water loss due to [[evaporation]], reduce weeds, minimize [[erosion]], dust and mud problems. Mulch can also add nutrients to the soil when it decomposes. However, mulch is most often used for weed suppression.  Over use of mulch can result in harm to the selected plantings. Care must be taken in the source of the mulch, for instance, black walnut trees result in a toxic mulch product. Grass cycling turf areas (using mulching mowers that leave grass clippings on the lawn) will also decrease the amount of fertilizer needed, reduce landfill waste and reduce costs of disposal.&lt;ref name="ciwmb.ca.gov"/&gt;

A common recommendation is to adding 2-4&amp;nbsp;inches of mulch in flower beds and under trees away from the trunk. Mulch should be applied under trees to the dripline (extension of the branches) in lieu of flowers, [[hosta]]s, [[turf]] or other plants that are often planted there. This practice of planting under trees is detrimental to tree roots, especially when such plants are irrigated to an excessive level that harms the tree. One must be careful not to apply mulch to the bark of the tree.  It can result in smothering, mold and to insect depredation.

The practice of [[xeriscaping]] or water-wise gardening suggests that placing plants with similar water demands together will save time and low-water or drought tolerant plants would be a smart initial consideration.

A homeowner may consider consulting an accredited irrigation technician/auditor and obtain a water audit of current systems. In the event that the situation is difficult to manage, drip or sub-surface irrigation may be most effective. If the system has been in use for over five years, upgrading to [[evapotranspiration]] (ET) controllers, soil sensors and refined control panels will improve the system. Often irrigation heads are in need of readjustment to avoid sprinkling on sidewalks or streets. Business owners may consider developing watering schedules based on historical or actual weather data and soil probes to monitor soil moisture prior to watering.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu"/&gt;

== Building materials ==
{{see also|Sustainable architecture}}
When deciding what kind of building materials to put on a site it is important to recycle as often as possible. Reusing old bricks from sidewalks as patio pavers is one way to provide an aesthetic appeal to an area while reducing what goes to the landfill.

But it is also important to be careful about what materials you use, especially if you plan to grow food crops of any kind. Old telephone poles and railroad ties have usually been treated with a substance called [[creosote]] that can leach into the soils and make any food grown there toxic enough to cause harm to anyone that eats it. In general, you should avoid any kind of treated material, especially wood, that could leach into the soil with rain.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"&gt;Sustainable Landscape Design's Custom Design Philosophy. http://www.sustainable-landscape.com/about.html.

The [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (http://www.fscus.org/) was formed in 1993 "to change the dialogue about and the practice of sustainable forestry worldwide." Sustainably harvested lumber - also called [[certified wood]] is now available, in which ecological, economic and social factors are integrated into the management of trees used for lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bearcreeklumber.com/products/intextboth/sustainable.html. Viewed 12-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt; A chain of custody document is used in the certification process.

== Planting selection ==
{{see also|Xeriscaping|Native plant}}
One important part of sustainable landscaping is plant selection. Most of what makes a landscape unsustainable is the amount of inputs required to grow a non-native plant on it. What this means is that a local plant, which has adapted to local climate conditions will require less work on the part of some other agent to flourish. For example, it does not make sense to grow tomatoes in Arizona because there is not enough natural rainfall for them to survive without constant watering. Instead, [[drought-tolerant]] plants like [[succulents]] and [[cacti]] are better suited to survive. Also, by choosing native plants, one can avoid certain problems with insects and pests because these plants will also be adapted to deal with any local invader. The bottom line is that by choosing the right kind of local plants, a great deal of money can be saved on amendment costs, pest control and watering.&lt;ref name="sustainable-landscape.com"/&gt;

Plants used as [[windbreak]]s can save up to 30% on [[heating costs]] in winter. They also help with shading a residence or commercial building in summer, create cool air through evapo-transpiration and can cool hardscaped areas such as driveways and sidewalks.&lt;ref&gt;Farmstead Windbreaks: Planning. http://www.extension.iastate.edu/Publications/PM1716.pdf. Retrieved 12-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

A house surrounded by local trees or bushes enjoys multiple benefits. Plants release [[water vapor]] in the air through [[transpiration]] and water has the ability to reduce temperature extremes in the areas near it (as it boasts very high [[heat capacity]]). The larger and more leafy the plant, the most water vapor it produces. Additionally, the presence of trees is crucial in the creation of stable, healthy and productive ecosystems (such as forests). In fact this is an important principle of [[permaculture]].

If the surrounding trees are chosen to produce edible fruit they can provide a sustainable food source for the occupants of the house. Even if some are fairly demanding (especially in the summer), irrigation is an excellent end-use option in [[greywater]] recycling and [[rainwater harvesting]] systems, and a [[composting toilet]] can cover (at least) some of the [[nutrient]] requirements. Research suggests that diluted human urine might be as effective as chemical fertilizers.{{fact|date=January 2016}} Not all fruit trees are suitable for greywater irrigation, as reclaimed greywater is typically of high pH and [[acidophile]] plants don't do well in alkaline environments.

An intelligent choice for direct energy conservation would be the placement of broadleaf [[deciduous]] trees near the east, west and optionally north-facing walls of the house. Such selection provides shading in the summer while permitting large amounts of heat-carrying solar radiation to strike the house in the winter. The trees are to be placed as closely as possible to the house walls but no closer than 1 meter - otherwise the roots can cause substantial foundation damage. A sustainable house will most likely be equipped with south-facing (north-facing in the S. hemisphere) [[photovoltaic panel]]s and a large, south-facing [[glazing (window)|glazing]] as a result of [[passive solar]] heating design. As the efficiency of both systems is very sensitive to shading, experts suggest the complete absence of trees near the south side.

Another intelligent choice would be that of a dense vegetative fence composed of evergreens (e.g. [[conifer]]s) near that side from which cold continental winds blow (usually north in the N. hemisphere) and also that side from which the [[prevailing winds]] blow (west in temperate regions of both hemispheres). Since north winds are most cold and westerlies blow most often, such choice creates an effective winter windbarrier that prevents very low temperatures outside the house and reduces air infiltration towards the inside. Calculations show that placing the windbrake at a distance twice the height of the trees can reduce the wind velocity by 75%. It then follows that, with some planning, both arrangements (deciduous and evergreen) can be applied simultaneously.&lt;ref name="GF"&gt;"Green from the ground up" by D. Johnston and S. Gibson&lt;/ref&gt;

The above vegetative arrangements come with two disadvantages. Firstly, they minimize air circulation in summer (although in many climates heating is more important and costly than cooling) and, secondly, they may affect the efficiency of photovoltaic panels, thus prompting the need for a shading analysis. However, it has been estimated that if both arrangements are applied properly, they can reduce the overall house energy usage by up to 22%.&lt;ref name="GF" /&gt;

== Maintenance ==
{{see also|Organic gardening}}
'''''Pest Problems'''''

Maintaining plant health will eliminate most pest problems. It is best to start with pest-free plant materials and supplies and close inspection of the plant upon purchase is also recommended. Establishing diversity within the area of plant species will encourage beneficial organism populations (e.g. birds, insects), which feed on potential plant pests. Attracting a wide variety of organisms with a variety of host plants has shown to be effective in increasing pollinator presence in agrarian settings &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cole|first=Lorna J.|last2=Brocklehurst|first2=Sarah|last3=Robertson|first3=Duncan|last4=Harrison|first4=William|last5=McCracken|first5=David I.|date=2015-12|title=Riparian buffer strips: Their role in the conservation of insect pollinators in intensive grassland systems|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167880915002327|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems &amp; Environment|volume=211|pages=207–220|doi=10.1016/j.agee.2015.06.012|issn=0167-8809}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Because plant pests vary from plant to plant, assessing the problem correctly is half the battle. The owner must consider whether the plant can tolerate the damage caused by the pest. If not, then does the plant value justify some sort of treatment? While pesticide is often chosen to solve the problem, physical barriers and repellents may help. If pesticides are the chosen method, selective organic or natural pesticide is often better because it has less impact on non-target species.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; 

'''''Pruning'''''

Proper pruning will increase air circulation and decrease the likelihood of plant diseases. However, improper pruning is detrimental to shrubs and trees.&lt;ref name="ext.colostate.edu" /&gt; Hedging, topping and shearing of landscape plants causes excessive plant growth. In addition, topping is a hazardous practice which creates a hazardous tree which is highly susceptible to wind damage. Natural pruning techniques during the proper season, on the other hand, promotes healthier, more stable plants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; In temperate areas, deciduous plants should be pruned during dormancy. Plants should never be pruned at the end of a growing season because growth is stimulated and such new growth will be too tender to survive winter freezing temperatures.

'''''Pollution Prevention'''''

Landscape managers should make use of the Integrated Pest Management (IPM) to reduce use of pesticides and herbicides and reduce non-point source solution. As there is considerable debate on the safety levels of nitrates and the impact of fertilizer run-off, more studies are needed in order to determine if the risks justify the outcomes of applying nitrate-ladden fertilizers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powlson|first=David S.|last2=Addiscott|first2=Tom M.|last3=Benjamin|first3=Nigel|last4=Cassman|first4=Ken G.|last5=Kok|first5=De|last6=M|first6=Theo|last7=van Grinsven|first7=Hans|last8=L'hirondel|first8=Jean-Louis|last9=Avery|first9=Alex A.|date=2008-03-01|title=When Does Nitrate Become a Risk for Humans?|url=https://www.agronomy.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/37/2/291|journal=Journal of Environmental Quality|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=291–295|doi=10.2134/jeq2007.0177|pmid=18268290|issn=1537-2537}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Self is the author of eleven novels, five collections of shorter fiction, three novellas, and five collections of non-fiction writing. His work has been translated into 22 languages; his 2002 novel ''[[Dorian, an Imitation]]'' was longlisted for the [[Booker Prize]], and his novel ''[[Umbrella (novel)|Umbrella]]'' was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/arts/english/staff/will-self|title=Will Self&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His fiction is known for being satirical, grotesque, and fantastical, and is predominantly set within his home city of [[London]]. His subject matter often includes [[mental illness]], [[illegal drugs]] and [[psychiatry]].

Self is a regular contributor to publications including ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[London Review of Books]]''. He currently writes a column for the ''[[New Statesman]]'', and over the years he has been a columnist for the ''Observer'', ''[[The Times]]'', and the ''[[Evening Standard]]''. His columns for ''Building Design'' on the built environment, and for the ''[[Independent Magazine]]'' on the psychology of place brought him to prominence as a thinker concerned with the politics of [[urbanism]].

Self is a regular contributor on British television, initially as a guest on comic [[panel show]]s such as ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''. In 2002, Self replaced [[Mark Lamarr]] on the anarchic BBC comedy panel show ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Self|first1=Will|title=Shooting Stars|url=http://will-self.com/2009/01/02/shooting-stars/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowell|first1=Ben|title=Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer line up new series of Shooting Stars|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/03/vic-reeves-bob-mortimer-shooting-stars-new-series|accessdate=19 March 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; for two series, but was himself replaced by comedian [[Jack Dee]] when the programme returned in 2008.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;  He has since appeared on current affairs programmes such as ''[[Newsnight]]'' and ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. Self is also a frequent contributor to the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme A Point of View,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Self|first1=Will|title=A Point of View|url=http://will-self.com/2017/02/01/a-point-of-view-3/|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which he contributes radio essays delivered in his familiar "lugubrious tones".&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowell|first1=Ben|title=Will Self in talks to become Radio 4 writer-in-residence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/18/will-self-radio-4-writer-residence|accessdate=19 March 2018|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Self was in talks to become the inaugural BBC Radio 4 Writer-in-Residence,&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; but later backed out of the talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowell|first1=Ben|title=Will Self backs out of talks to be Radio 4’s writer-in-residence|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2013-07-22/will-self-backs-out-of-talks-to-be-radio-4s-writer-in-residence/|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Self was born at Charing Cross hospital in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/sep/18/would-that-all-journeys-were-on-foot-writers-on-the-joy-of-walking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=william%20w&amp;lastname=self&amp;eventyear=1961&amp;eventyear_offset=0 |title=findmypast.co.uk |publisher=Search.findmypast.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought up in north London, between the suburbs of [[East Finchley]] and [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|last=Charney|first=Noah|title=Will Self: How I Write|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/09/will-self-how-i-write.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His  parents were [[Peter Self|Peter John Otter Self]], Professor of Public Administration at the [[London School of Economics]], and Elaine Rosenbloom, from [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]], who worked as a publisher's assistant.&lt;ref&gt;M.

Hunter Hayes ''Understanding Will Self'', p.10&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Self spent a year living in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] in [[upstate New York|upstate]] [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

Self's parents separated when he was nine, and divorced when he was 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/15/biography.review | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Will | last=Self | title=Biography (Books genre), Books, Culture | date=2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the intellectual encouragement given by his parents, he was an emotionally confused and self-destructive child, harming himself with cigarette ends and knives before getting into drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://72.166.46.24/archive/features/00/11/09/WILL_SELF1.html "Living Will"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Self was a voracious reader from a young age. When he was ten, he developed an interest in works of science fiction such as [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' and those of [[J. G. Ballard]] and [[Philip K. Dick]]. Into his teenage years, Self claimed to have been "overawed by the canon", stifling his ability to express himself. Nevertheless, Self's dabbling with drugs grew in step with his prolific reading. Self started smoking marijuana at the age of 12, graduating through amphetamines, cocaine, and LSD to heroin, which he started injecting at 18.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Will Self's Transgressive Fictions Brian. Finney From: Postmodern Culture  Volume 11, Number 3, May 2001 http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/summary/v011/11.3finney.html&lt;/ref&gt; Self struggled with mental health issues during this period, and at the age of 20 became a hospital [[outpatient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/will-self|title=Will Self|author=John Freedman|date=11 April 2014|work=Interview Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self attended [[University College School]], an [[independent school]] for boys in [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Have I Got News For You?]]'', Series 13 episode 1&lt;/ref&gt; He later attended [[Christ's College, Finchley]], from where he went to [[Exeter College, Oxford|Exeter College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], reading [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], graduating with a third class degree.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="you_ask_the_questions"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/you-ask-the-questions-will-self-672941.html| location=London | work=The Independent | title=You ask the questions: Will Self | date=2001-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to have only attended two lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penguinrandomhouse.ca/hazlitt/feature/were-all-surrealists-now-interview-will-self|title='We're All Surrealists Now': An Interview with Will Self|author=|date=|work=Hazlitt}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Oxford he became editor of and frequent contributor to an underground left-wing student newspaper called Red Herring/Oxford Strumpet, copies of which are archived in the [[Bodleian Library]]. His reasons for reading PPE rather than English literature were discussed by Self in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper:&lt;blockquote&gt;I [had] a pretty thorough grounding in the canon, but I certainly didn't want to be involved with criticism. Even then it seemed inimical to what it was to be a writer, which is what I really wanted to be.&lt;ref name="Addicted_to_transmogrification"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wroe|first=Nicholas|title=Addicted to transmogrification|publisher=The Guardian|date=2001-06-02|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4196343,00.html|accessdate=2007-02-09 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of Self's background Nick Rennison has written that he:
&lt;blockquote&gt;is sometimes presented as a bad-boy outsider, writing, like the Americans [[William S. Burroughs|William S Burroughs]] and [[Hubert Selby, Jr.|Hubert Selby Jr]], about sex, drugs and violence in a very direct way. Yet he is not some class warrior storming the citadels of the literary establishment from the outside, but an Oxford educated, middle-class metropolitan who, despite his protestations to the contrary in interviews, is about as much at the heart of the establishment as you can get, a place he has occupied almost from the start of his career.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hunter Hayes ''Understanding Will Self'', p12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Willselfauthor.jpg|right|thumb|Self at a 2002 book signing]]
After graduating from Oxford, Self worked for the Greater London Council, including a period as a road sweeper, while living in [[Brixton]].&lt;ref name="you_ask_the_questions" /&gt; He then pursued a career as a cartoonist for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' and other publications and as a [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up]] comedian.&lt;ref name="you_ask_the_questions" /&gt; He moved to [[Gloucester Road, London|Gloucester Road]] around 1985. In 1986 he entered a treatment centre in [[Weston-super-Mare]], where he claimed that his heroin addiction was cured.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; In 1989, "through a series of accidents", he "blagged" his way into running a small publishing company.&lt;ref name="theparisreview.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2012/08/09/larger-than-life-an-interview-with-will-self/|title=Larger Than Life: An Interview With Will Self|author=Jacques Testard|date=|work=The Paris Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/will-self-is-apple-worthy-of-reverence/#.UuJBvRyQEy4|title=The Book of Jobs |author=|date=|work=prospectmagazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of his short story collection ''[[The Quantity Theory of Insanity]]'' brought him to public attention in 1991. Self was hailed as an original new talent by [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Beryl Bainbridge]], [[A. S. Byatt]], and [[Bill Buford]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 1993 he was nominated by ''[[Granta]]'' magazine as one of the 20 "Best Young British Novelists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.specialistspeakers.com/?p=1670|title=Will Self|author=Specialist Speakers Profile|date=|work=specialistspeakers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Self's second book, ''[[My Idea of Fun]]'', was "mauled" by the critics.&lt;ref&gt;No 242: Will Self The Guardian (1959–2003) [London (UK)] 16 Sep 1993: A3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self joined the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'' as a columnist in 1995.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; He gained negative publicity in 1997 when he was sent to cover the election campaign of [[John Major]] and was caught by a rival journalist using [[heroin]] on the Prime Minister's jet, and was fired as a result.&lt;ref name="Addicted_to_transmogrification" /&gt; At the time, he argued "I'm a hack who gets hired because I do drugs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/11/willself | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Will Self (Author), Books, Culture | date=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' as a columnist in 1997.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; In 1999 he left ''Times'' to join the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'',&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; which he left in 2002 for the ''[[Evening Standard]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

He has made many appearances on British television, especially as a panellist on ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and as a regular on ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]''. Since 2008 Self has appeared five times on ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. He stopped appearing in ''Have I Got News for You'', stating the show had become a ''pseudo''-panel show.

Since 2009, Self has written two alternating fortnightly columns for the ''[[New Statesman]]''. ''The Madness of Crowds'' explores social phenomena and [[group behaviour]], and in ''Real Meals'' he reviews high street food outlets.

In 2012, Self was appointed Professor of Contemporary Thought at [[Brunel University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/news-items/ne_161686|title=Will Self joins Brunel University as Professor of Contemporary Thought|author=|date=|work=brunel.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Self received his first [[Man Booker Prize]] longlist nomination for ''Umbrella'', which ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described as "possibly Self's most ambitious novel to date".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booker-prize/9426994/Man-Booker-Prize-longlist-who-are-they.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Man Booker Prize longlist: who are they? | date=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was later placed on the prize shortlist.

For a May 2014 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Self wrote: "the literary novel as an art work and a narrative art form central to our culture is indeed dying before our eyes", explaining in a July 2014 article that his royalty income had decreased "dramatically" over the previous decade. The July article followed the release of a study of the earnings of British authors that was commissioned by the Authors' Licensing and Collecting Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Alison Flood|title=Authors' incomes collapse to 'abject' levels|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jul/08/authors-incomes-collapse-alcs-survey?CMP=twt_gu|accessdate=12 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Self began a 50&amp;nbsp;km walking tour of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] near [[Geneva]]  for [[BBC Radio 4]], invited by physicist Akram Khan to "feel the wonder" of [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self Orbits CERN|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04xxvtb|website=[[BBC Radio 4]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He featured in the 2016 documentary [[The Future of Work and Death]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/mar/03/no-more-death-taxes-but-do-we-really-want-to-live-forever-with-nothing-to-do|title=The Future of Work and Death - The Guardian|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary style==
[[File:Will Self at Humber Mouth 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Self in 2007]]
According to M. Hunter Hayes, Self has given his reason for writing as follows: "I don't write fiction for people to identify with and I don't write a picture of the world they can recognise. I write to astonish people."&lt;ref&gt;M. Hunter Hayes ''Understanding Will Self'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; "What excites me is to disturb the reader's fundamental assumptions. I want to make them feel that certain categories within which they are used to perceiving the world are unstable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finney|first1=Brian|title=Will Self's Transgressive Fictions|journal=Postmodern Culture|date=May 2001|volume=11|issue=3|doi=10.1353/pmc.2001.0015|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/postmodern_culture/v011/11.3finney.html|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influences on his fiction mentioned most frequently include [[J. G. Ballard]] whom he considers "a great mentor", [[William Burroughs]] and [[Hunter S. Thompson]]. He has cited{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} influences such as [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[Joseph Heller]] and [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]&lt;ref name="Self on Celine"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/books/review/Self.t.html|date=10 September 2006|title=Céline’s Dark Journey|author=Will Self|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as formative influences on his writing style.

[[Zack Busner]] is a recurring character in Self's fiction, appearing in the short story collections ''The Quantity Theory of Insanity'', ''Grey Area'' and ''Dr. Mukti and Other Tales of Woe'', as well as in the novels ''Great Apes'', ''The Book of Dave'', ''Umbrella'' and ''Shark''. Busner is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst practising in London, and is prone to self-promotion at the expense of his patients. He is often the [[antagonist]] of the stories he appears in, although not always with villainous intent.

Among Self's admirers is the American critic [[Harold Bloom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=Genius : a mosaic of one hundred exemplary creative minds|year=2002|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-69129-1|page=648|quote="There are a few affinities, except perhaps with the admirable Antonia Byatt, in the generation after: novelists I also now admire, like Will Self, Peter Ackroyd, and John Banville."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Stuart Maconie]] has described him as "that rarity in modern cultural life, a genuine intellectual with a bracing command of words and ideas who is also droll, likeable and culturally savvy."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Maconie. "My People". ''[[Radio Times]]'' 2–8 February 2013, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 UK general election]], Self voted [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in a general election first time since [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997]]. In May 2015, he wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "No, I'm no longer a socialist if to be one is to believe that a socialist utopia is attainable by some collective feat of will – but I remain a socialist, if by 'socialism' is understood an antipathy to vested interests and privileges neither deserved nor earned, and a strong desire for a genuinely egalitarian society."&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news |last=Self|first=Will|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/01/will-self-oscar-wilde-champagne-socialist-voting-labour|title=Will Self: Oscar Wilde, champagne socialism and why I’m voting Labour|work= |location= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, he wrote in the ''[[New Statesman]]'': "Nowadays I think in terms of compassionate pragmatism: I'll leave socialism to [[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] and the other bloviators."&lt;ref name="newstatesman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Self|first=Will|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/03/i-was-no-fan-new-labour-brexit-requires-original-thinking-corbyn-cant-provide|title=Will Self: I was no fan of New Labour – but Brexit requires original thinking Corbyn can't provide|work= |location= |publisher=''[[New Statesman]]''|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, Self endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6nbZWfg8R8|title=Jeremy Corbyn: Will Self and John McTernan debate|publisher=[[Channel 4 News]]|date=30 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said during a ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' interview that Corbyn represents a useful ideological divide within Labour, and could lead to the formation of a schism in the party.&lt;ref name="londonlovesbusiness"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vinter|first1=Robyn|last2=Cockburn|first2=Harry|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/business-news/politics/all-these-celebrity-jeremy-corbyn-fans-might-surprise-you/11650.article|title=All these celebrity Jeremy Corbyn fans might surprise you|work= |location= |publisher=''London Loves Business''|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Self's mother died in 1988.&lt;ref name="theparisreview.org" /&gt; He was married from 1989 to 1997 to Kate Chancellor. They have two children, a son Alexis and a daughter Madeleine.

{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2011}}
'''William Channing Woodbridge''' (December 8, 1794{{spaced ndash}}November 9, 1845) was an American [[geographer]], [[Education reform|educational reformer]], and the author of many [[geography]] textbooks.

==Early life and family==

Woodbridge's father, [[William Woodbridge (educator)|William Woodbridge]], was a [[Yale University]] graduate, [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]], and a major advocate for educational change in [[Connecticut]].  The senior Woodbridge wrote textbooks on grammar and spelling, and was the first [[List of Phillips Exeter Academy Principals|preceptor]] of [[Phillips Exeter Academy]].  He worked with his son on some of the younger Woodbridge’s projects. His mother was Ann Channing, the aunt of Bostonian [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] theologian [[William Ellery Channing]].

William Channing Woodbridge was born in [[Medford, Massachusetts]]. His family soon moved to [[Connecticut]], where his parents taught him Latin, Greek, chemistry and mathematics. Throughout his life, he suffered from what was then called [[scrofula]], which today would probably be diagnosed as [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-mJLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |title = The American Journal of Education|last = Barnard|first = Henry|date = 1858-01-01|publisher = F.C. Brownell|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at Yale==
In June 1808, Woodbridge entered Yale as the youngest member of his freshman class. Here, he was inspired by Yale College's president, [[Timothy Dwight IV]].  Woodbridge developed an interest in both the American landscape and in the publication of geographies, and was a member of the Society of [[Brothers in Unity]]. Many of the values later reflected in his publications were those of Yale at this time. Woodbridge was a true son of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], believing in the importance of reason and observation.  However, like Dwight he remained a committed [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]]. Woodbridge rejected the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] ideas which were then influencing so many of his friends and relatives. He believed passionately in science, but he was certain that this knowledge of the material world could only lead people closer to God and to a firmer morality. He believed in the essential unity of all humans. After discussing the location of the various races of mankind, his 1830 edition of ''Rudiments of Geography'' reminds readers, “The scriptures inform us that all of these races are brethren of the same family; the children of the same first parents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9sMAAAAYAAJ|title=Rudiments of geography: on a new plan : designed to assist the memory by comparison and classification : with numerous engravings of manners, customs, and curiosities : accompanied with an atlas ...|last=Woodbridge|first=William Channing|date=1830-01-01|publisher=O.D. Cooke and co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching the deaf ==
Upon graduation, Woodbridge briefly attended [[Princeton University]] with the hope of studying [[theology]] and becoming a [[missionary]]. When ill health made this impossible, he turned to teaching. Eventually, he accepted a position as an instructor with [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet]] at the [[American School for the Deaf|Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Here, he pioneered in teaching geography to the disabled. Woodbridge also began work on a small geography text which would eventually be published as ''Rudiments of Geography''.&lt;ref&gt;Walters 1993, p. 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alcott 1858, p. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walters, William D. Jr: “William Channing Woodbridge: Geographer,” page 42-47, The Journal of Social Studies 16 &amp; 17: 2, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodbridge, William Channing: "The Rudiments of Geography, on a new plan designed to assist the memory of comparison and classification: with numerous engravings of manners, customs and curiosities, and accompanied by an atlas", Hartford: S. G. Goodrich, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel to Europe==
[[File:Woodbridge isothermal chart3.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Isothermal chart of the world created in 1823 by Woodbridge using the work of [[Alexander von Humboldt]].]]
In October 1820, Woodbridge left his teaching job and traveled to [[Europe]]. He was desperate to improve his health and keen to meet prominent European educators and visit their schools. He also wanted to gather material for an expanded geography. He traveled via [[Gibraltar]] and [[Algeciras]] to [[Palermo]], [[Livorno]], and [[Rome]]. He returned to Hartford in July 1821, where he began writing a new and greatly expanded geography that would incorporate what he had learned in Europe. It was eventually published 1824 as ''A System of Universal Geography''.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbridge, William Channing: "A System of Universal Geography, Ancient and Modern, on the Principals of Comparison and Classification", Hartford, Oliver D. Cooke and Son, 1824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walters 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alcott 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; The book would remain in print, with small variations in title, until 1866.

==Second trip to Europe==
For Woodbridge, understanding European thinkers was critical to improving American education. In the fall of 1824, he left the United States for a second and more extended trip across the Atlantic. The small amount of money he earned from books was insufficient to support even his very humble lifestyle. Therefore, he supplemented his earnings by teaching the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Walters Jr, William D: “William Channing Woodbridge: Geographer,” page 44, The Journal of Social Studies 16 &amp; 17: 2, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; For all of his admiration of European educators and geographers, he decided they were behind the United States in two areas: female education and teaching the disabled. Woodbridge spent the summer of 1826 teaching in [[Hofwil|Hofwil, Switzerland]], where [[Philipp Emanuel von Fellenberg]] had established an influential experimental school. Woodbridge was in Paris in January 1827, correcting proofs of his new geography textbook. He had made the acquaintance of the great German explorer, scholar, and student of physical geography [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. Woodbridge continued to correspond with von Humboldt and incorporated many of von Humboldt’s ideas in his geographies. In the introduction to his new geography text he thanked von Humboldt and the [[Geographical Society of Paris]] for their assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Walters 1993, p. 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40QAAAAAYAAJ|title=A System of Universal Geography: On the Principles of Comparison and Classification. Atlas|last=Woodbridge|first=William Channing|date=1827-01-01|publisher=Oliver D. Cooke &amp; Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Geoffrey J: “The Emergence and Development of Geographic Thought in New England,” page 1–13, Economic Geography 74, March 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Woodbridge then went back to Hofwyl, probably sometime in 1828, before returning to New England in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Alcott 1858, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work to improve music education==
While on his second trip to Europe, Woodbridge observed the teaching of vocal music by Nägeli, Pfeiffer, Kübler and others, and brought home many of their works with him.&lt;ref&gt;"Educational Labors of Lowell Mason", The American Journal of Education, p. 139-147, 4, 1857.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to Hartford, he began working with [[Elam Ives, Jr.]] to see those Pestalozzian-based teaching methods applied. Their experiment was apparently successful.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Howard Eber: "The Influence of Pestalozzianism on Instruction in Music," (Doctoral dissertation), 1957, p. 142-145. Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses (5801396)&lt;/ref&gt; During this same time, Woodbridge had gone to Boston and met [[Lowell Mason]], whom he persuaded to go and observe Ives' experiments in Hartford.&lt;ref&gt;Gilsig, Marcie-Ann: "Elam Ives, Jr. (1802-1864): Musician-Educator" (Doctoral Dissertation) Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (ML31197), 1985, p. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodbridge left Hartford in 1830 and discontinued his relationship with Ives. Instead, he supported Mason (who—at least initially—adopted many of his imported methods) through the Boston Academy of Music, of which he was the corresponding secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, Carol Ann: "Lowell Mason: His Life and Work" (Doctoral Dissertation) Retrieved from ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (7128272), 1971, p. 178-179.&lt;/ref&gt; His promotion of Mason through lectures in Boston and through his ''American Annals of Education'' eventually helped Mason win support to introduce music education into the Boston public schools, a feat which William Alcott would say was "a service which alone would have made him a public benefactor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mJLAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 |title=The American Journal of Education|last=Barnard|first=Henry|date=1858-01-01|publisher=F.C. Brownell|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work with William A. Alcott==
It was in Hartford, in the spring of 1830, that Woodbridge met [[William A. Alcott]]. Alcott would later remember the meeting, writing that he had entered a tavern, just as Woodbridge was leaving. He asked the publican who that was and was told that it was William Channing Woodbridge, who was a great friend of education. Alcott followed Woodbridge down the street and introduced himself. He was astonished when Woodbridge responded to the introduction with a question; "what is the great practical error in all of our school education?" Without hesitation, Alcott replied that it was,”the strange effort to crowd the intellect at the expense of health, morals, and everything else.”  These words, Alcott wrote, “bound as friends for life.” &lt;ref&gt;Alcott, William A: "Confessions of a Schoolmaster", (reprinted by New York Arno Press in 1969) 1856&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1831, Woodbridge had shifted his base of operations from Hartford to Boston. The first joint effort of Woodbridge and Alcott was the publication of an improved educational journal. In 1831, Woodbridge purchased the American Journal of Education, which was renamed the Annals of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, E.R. (1984) "William Channing Woodbridge's Lecture `On Vocal Music as a Branch of Common Education' Revisited." ''Studies in Music'', 18, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next five years Alcott and Woodbridge contributed many articles and textbook reviews to the Annals. Woodbridge and Alcott filled the Annals with a wide range of articles on educational topics, reflected on developments in Europe, and pressed for educational reform. They were particularly concerned with women’s education and with incorporating the ideas of [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and the French reformer [[Joseph Jocotot]] into American schools, both of whom had stressed the importance of observation and of geography.  By the time hard times swept away their control of the Annals in 1836, its reputation as the leading American educational publication was firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Walters Jr., William D: “Voices for reform in Early American Geographical Education",  p. 156-160, Journal of Geography 86:4, July–August 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alcott 1858, p. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication with Emma Willard==
For some time Woodbridge had also been associated with [[Emma Willard]]. Together they worked on many geography texts. Their complex publication efforts had begun in the early 1820s. When both were growing up, their families lived within five miles of each other in Connecticut. Both shared a passionate interest in causes like educational reform and the education of women. Because it had originally been intended to publish Woodbridge’s Rudiments of Geography with an early geography by Willard, and because Willard’s Ancient Geography was eventually published with Woodbridge’s work as Universal Geography, there was considerable confusion about the role of each author. Emma Willard had to publicly assure readers that the “system of modern geography” had been entirely written and arranged by Woodbridge.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbridge and Willard, 1827.&lt;/ref&gt; Their various combined geographies proved to be very successful.  By 1827, they had reached an arrangement to pool and split royalties; Woodbridge would get five sevenths of the money and Willard would receive two sevenths. This seems to have reflected their relative contributions. Woodbridge seems to have done most of the updating as well as handling many of the financial arrangements with the publishers. Throughout Woodbridge’s life the two authors remained on cordial terms.&lt;ref&gt;Walters Jr., William D: “Emma Willard’s Geographies,” p. 118-138, Pennsylvania Geographer 37, Spring/Summer 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Tolley has recently argued that the Woodbridge and Willard geographies, with their strong emphasis on field work and observation, were important in encouraging American women to develop an interest in science&lt;ref&gt;Tolley, Kimberly: "The Science Education of American Girls: A Historical Perspective", New York, Rutledge Palmer, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and Daniel H. Calhoun has made the case for their importance in the world view of Americans in the Jacksonian era.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, Danliel A: "Eyes for the Jacksonan World: William C. Woodbridge and Emma Willard", Journal of the Early Republic 4, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication of ''On the Best Methods of Teaching Geography''==
In 1834 Woodbridge presented and later published ”On the Best Methods of Teaching Geography.” This is almost certainly the first extended discussion geographic education written by an American. The need for such an effort reflected the growing importance of geography in American schools. In his essay, Woodbridge argued that simple memorization of names was insufficient; each word had to be supported in the student’s mind by a clearly defined concept. The active use of maps was essential because those being taught had to see places in relation to each other. He felt that the small amount of knowledge that could be acquired in a classroom was not of much practical use to travelers, explorers, soldiers or missionaries; the real importance of geography was to lead the students outside his own limited experience and to learn to see themselves as part of a larger human family. The well-taught student of geography, he argued, should learn to wonder without condemning and to smile at some new experience without contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Woodbridge, William Channing: “On the best Methods of Teaching Geography, Lectures Before the American Institute of Instruction", page 209-240, Boston American Institute of Instruction 1834&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy in authorship==
By modern standards, Woodbridge’s books are small. Rudiments of geography, one of the smallest, was only six by three and a half inches (15 x 9&amp;nbsp;cm). The same illustrations were often used in several different books, as they were expensive to create. In content, Woodbridge’s geographies stress several common points. He saw physical geography as more important than human, simply because it was less likely to change. He introduced many European ideas about the planet to American audiences. In his discussions of the human condition in various regions, Woodbridge emphasised that the human condition in any part of the globe is primarily the product of access to education and opportunity. Climate, religion, and the nature of governments played some role, but he had no place for the racial slurs that were to disfigure so many American textbooks of the second half of the nineteenth century. He regarded the way in which societies treated and educated women as a useful measure of their degree of enlightenment. His geographies, like almost all of the schools they were intended for, were overtly Christian, but could never be mistaken for religious tracts.

Maps were Woodbridge's passion. Often his text would begin with the student’s home or classroom and work outwards to the wider world.&lt;ref&gt;Bruckner, Martin: "The Geographic Revolution in Early America: Maps literacy and National Identity", Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the Geographical societies of Paris, Frankfurt and Berlin, scanning their pages for new information. Geoffery Martin has called Woodbridge, “one of the most reliable mapmakers of his time.”&lt;ref&gt;Martin 1998, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This is ironic because some modern readers are struck by the relatively few number of maps in some of his works; this is often because many were bound and sold together with a small atlas. These atlases, which usually command higher value in the antique market than the texts, have often been separated from their original companions.

==Personal life==
In 1832 Woodbridge married Lucy Ann Reed, who had been an assistant teacher in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]]. He actively campaigned for improvement in the Common schools of Massachusetts. He became a leader in the “Society for the Relief and Improvement of the African Race.” Throughout the 1830s and early 1840s he continued to expand, update, and revise his textbooks. In particular, over time, there is a noticeable improvement in the number and quality of maps and illustrations. In addition to constant sickness, Woodbridge spent most of his life in near poverty. Income from one book was often used to improve the next and he was unable to resist an appeal from anyone in need. In search of improved health and for new information for his geographies, Woodbridge returned to Europe in 1836. His young wife eventually joined him there, but died in [[Frankfurt]] in 1840, leaving Woodbridge with the care of their two small children. He traveled to [[Berlin]] for the winter of 1841-1842 and then returned to Boston.  His health continued to deteriorate, and hoping that a more tropical climate would relieve his symptoms, he spent the last three winters of his life in [[St. Croix]], in what was then Danish Territory, but is now part of the United States [[Virgin Islands]]. An illustration the 1847 edition of his Modern School Geography shows Woodbridge working in his study there with a map on the wall and a shelf of books (p. ix). William Channing Woodbridge died in Boston in 1845 and is buried in Marblehead, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Alcott 1858, p. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AIZAAAAYAAJ|title=Modern School Geography: On the Plan of Comparison and Classification : with an Atlas ...|last=Woodbridge|first=William Channing|date=1850-01-01|publisher=Wm.
