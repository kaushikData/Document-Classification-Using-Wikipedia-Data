'''118''' ('''one hundred [and] eighteen''') is the [[natural number]] following [[117 (number)|117]] and preceding [[119 (number)|119]].

==In mathematics==
There is no answer to the equation [[Euler's totient function|&amp;phi;]](x) = 118, making 118 a [[nontotient]].

118 is the smallest ''n'' such that the range ''n'', ''n'' + 1, ... 4''n''/3 contains at least one prime from each of these forms: 4''x'' + 1, 4''x'' - 1, 6''x'' + 1 and 6''x'' - 1.

Four expressions for 118 as the sum of three positive integers have the same product:
:14 + 50 + 54 = 15 + 40 + 63 = 18 + 30 + 70 = 21 + 25 + 72 = 118 and
:14 × 50 × 54 = 15 × 40 × 63 = 18 × 30 × 70 = 21 × 25 × 72 = 37800.
118 is the smallest number that can be expressed as four sums with the same product in this way.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, D. ''[[The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers]]'' London: Penguin Group. (1987): 134 - 135&lt;/ref&gt;

'''137''' ('''one hundred [and] thirty-seven''') is the [[natural number]] following [[136 (number)|136]] and preceding [[138 (number)|138]].

==In mathematics ==
137 is:

* the 33rd [[prime number]]; the next is [[139 (number)|139]], with which it comprises a [[twin prime]], and thus 137 is a [[Chen prime]]. 
* an [[Eisenstein prime]] with no imaginary part and a real part of the form &lt;math&gt;3n - 1&lt;/math&gt;. 
* the fourth [[Stern prime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A042978|title=Sloane's A042978 : Stern primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[pythagorean prime]]: 11&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (or 121 + 16).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002144|title=Sloane's A002144 : Pythagorean primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a [[strong prime]] in the sense that it is more than the [[arithmetic mean]] of its two neighboring primes.
* a [[strictly non-palindromic number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A016038|title=Sloane's A016038 : Strictly non-palindromic numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[primeval number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A072857|title=Sloane's A072857 : Primeval numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using two radii to divide a circle according to the [[golden ratio]] yields sectors of approximately 137° (the [[golden angle]]) and [[two hundred twenty-two|222]]°.&lt;br&gt;
1/137 = 0.00729927007299270072992700..., its period value is [[palindromic number|palindromic]] and has a [[repeating decimal|period length]] of only 8. 1/137 was once believed to be the exact value of the [[fine-structure constant]].

==In physics==

* Since the early 1900s, physicists have postulated that the number could lay at the heart of a [[grand unified theory]], relating theories of electromagnetism, quantum mechanics and, especially, gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Rutland, G., ''Awesome Sovereign'' ([[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]: [[AuthorHouse]], 2016), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_l1CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT33&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 33].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman]] website, [http://www.feynman.com/science/the-mysterious-137/ "The Mysterious 137"].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[fine structure constant]], a [[dimensionless physical constant]], is approximately 1/137, and the astronomer [[Arthur Eddington]] conjectured in 1929 that its reciprocal was in fact precisely the integer 137, which he claimed could be "obtained by pure deduction".&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Eddington|Eddington, A.S.]], ''The Constants of Nature'' in "The World of Mathematics", Vol. 2 (1956) Ed. [[James R. Newman|Newman, J.R.]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon and Schuster]], pp. 1074-1093.&lt;/ref&gt; This conjecture was not widely adopted, and by the 1940s, the experimental values for the constant were clearly inconsistent with it (i.e. closer to 137.036).&lt;ref&gt;Helge Kragh, "Magic Number: A Partial History of the Fine-Structure Constant", ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'' '''57''':5:395 (July, 2003) {{doi|10.1007/s00407-002-0065-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physicist [[Leon M. Lederman]] numbered his home near [[Fermilab]] 137 based on the significance of the number to those in his profession. Lederman expounded on the significance of the number in his book ''The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?'', noting that not only was it the inverse of the fine-structure constant, but was also related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon—i.e., Feynman's conjecture.{{refn|''There is a most profound and beautiful question associated with the observed coupling constant, e, the amplitude for a real electron to emit or absorb a real photon. It is a simple number that has been experimentally determined to be close to -0.08542455. (My physicist friends won’t recognize this number, because they like to remember it as the inverse of its square: about 137.03597 with about an uncertainty of about 2 in the last decimal place. It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.) Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from: is it related to p or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms?  Nobody knows. It’s one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the “hand of God” wrote that number, and “we don’t know how He pushed his pencil.” We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don’t know what kind of dance to do on the computer to make this number come out, without putting it in secretly!''—R. P. Feynman, ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''|group=n}} He added that it also "contains the crux of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (Planck's constant). It would be less unsettling if the relationship between all these important concepts turned out to be one or three or maybe a multiple of pi. But 137?” The number 137, according to Lederman, "shows up naked all over the place,” meaning that scientists on any planet in the universe using whatever units they have for charge or speed, and whatever their version of Planck’s constant may be, will all come up with 137, because it is a pure number. Lederman recalled that [[Richard Feynman]] had even suggested that all physicists put a sign in their offices with the number 137 to remind them of just how much they do not know.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon M. Lederman|Lederman, Leon]], ''The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question?'' (1993), [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Bohr model]], the innermost electron of an atom with ''Z'' = 137 would be orbiting (just below) the speed of light, and the next element (''Z'' = 138) would be "impossible".  Since the Bohr model does not include either quantum mechanics or special relativity, the fact that it breaks down in this regime is not unexpected.  However, such large atoms (if their nuclei were stable) could be expected to behave rather differently from a naive extrapolation of trends in the periodic table.
* [[Wolfgang Pauli]], a pioneer of [[quantum physics]], died in a hospital room numbered 137, a coincidence that disturbed him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Gratzer|Gratzer W]], ''The Pauli Principle'' in "Eurekas and Euphorias", (2002) [[OUP|Oxford University Press]], pp. 49-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In esoterism==

* The fine structure constant of physics continues to convince esotericists that the universe has numerological fine tuning:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integralworld.net/piacenza4.html The mystery of 137], www.integralworld.net&lt;/ref&gt; for example the [[age of the universe]] could be considered as roughly 13.7 times 1 billion years, though newer estimates put this value at 13.8.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal

* The [[Hebrew]] word &lt;big&gt;'''קבלה'''&lt;/big&gt; ([[Kabbalah]]) has a [[Gematria]] (numerical value) of 137. In Modern Hebrew, the root of Kabbalah (ק-ב-ל) can mean either "receiving" or "parallel." Kabbalah is generally taken to mean "the received tradition," which conveys the continuity of a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginsburgh|first1=Rabbi Yitzchak|title=What You Need to Know About Kabbalah|date=2006|publisher=Gal Einai Publications|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-7146-119|page=3|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the earlier nuance of meaning is seen in the first appearances of its root in the [[Torah]] (Exodus 26:5 and 36:12), where it means “parallel” or “corresponding” rather than “receiving.” It is used to describe the “corresponding loops” which, when clasped together, enjoined the two sections of the Tabernacle’s ceiling. These loops were suspended directly over the veil that divided the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. Symbolically, this is the threshold between the physical dimension and the utterly spiritual dimension. In other words, at the boundary line of the physical world, the number 137 emerges. The wisdom of Kabbalah is to find correspondences between the mundane and spiritual levels of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ginsburgh|first1=Rabbi Yitzchak|title=What You Need to Know About Kabbalah|date=2006|publisher=Gal Einai Publications|location=Jerusalem|isbn=965-7146-119|page=3|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Razborov''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Алекса́ндрович Разбо́ров}}; born February 16, 1963), sometimes known as '''Sasha Razborov''', is a [[USSR|Soviet]] and Russian [[mathematician]] and [[computational theorist]]. He is Andrew McLeish Distinguished Service Professor at the [[University of Chicago]].

== Research ==
In his best known work, joint with [[Steven Rudich]], he introduced the notion of ''natural proofs'', a class of strategies used to prove fundamental lower bounds in [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]]. In particular, Razborov and Rudich showed that, under the assumption that certain kinds of [[one-way function]]s exist, such proofs cannot give a resolution of the [[P = NP]] problem, so new techniques will be required in order to solve this question.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3035">In [[abstract algebra]], the term '''associator''' is used in different ways as a measure of the [[associativity|nonassociativity]] of an [[algebraic structure]]. Associators are commonly studied as [[triple system]]s.

==Ring theory==

For a [[nonassociative ring]] or [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|algebra]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the '''associator''' is the [[multilinear map]] &lt;math&gt;[\cdot,\cdot,\cdot] : R \times R \times R \to R&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz).&lt;/math&gt;

Just as the [[commutator]] 

: &lt;math&gt;[x, y] = xy - yx&lt;/math&gt;

measures the degree of [[commutativity|noncommutativity]], the associator measures the degree of nonassociativity of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.
For an [[associative ring]] or algebra the associator is identically zero.

The associator in any ring obeys the identity

:&lt;math&gt;w[x,y,z] + [w,x,y]z = [wx,y,z] - [w,xy,z] + [w,x,yz].&lt;/math&gt;

The associator is [[alternating form|alternating]] precisely when &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is an [[alternative ring]].

The associator is symmetric in its two rightmost arguments when &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is a [[pre-Lie algebra]].

The '''nucleus''' is the set of elements that associate with all others: that is, the ''n'' in ''R'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; [n,R,R] = [R,n,R] = [R,R,n] = \{0\} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

The nucleus is an associative subring of R.

==Quasigroup theory==

A [[quasigroup]] ''Q'' is a set with a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\cdot : Q\times Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; such that for each ''a,b'' in ''Q'',
the equations &lt;math&gt;a\cdot x = b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y\cdot a = b&lt;/math&gt; have unique solutions ''x,y'' in ''Q''. In a quasigroup ''Q'', the 
associator is the map &lt;math&gt;(\cdot,\cdot,\cdot) : Q\times Q\times Q\to Q&lt;/math&gt; defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;(a\cdot b)\cdot c=(a\cdot (b\cdot c))\cdot (a,b,c)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''a,b,c'' in ''Q''. As with its ring theory analog, the quasigroup associator is a measure of nonassociativity of ''Q''.

==Higher-dimensional algebra==

In [[higher-dimensional algebra]], where there may be non-identity morphisms between algebraic expressions, an '''associator''' is an isomorphism

:&lt;math&gt; a_{x,y,z} : (xy)z \mapsto x(yz).&lt;/math&gt;

==Category theory==
In [[category theory]], the associator expresses the associative properties of the internal product [[functor]] in [[monoidal category|monoidal categories]].

In [[mathematical analysis]], '''asymptotic analysis''', also known as '''asymptotics''', is a method of describing [[Limit (mathematics)|limiting]] behavior.

As an illustration, suppose that we are interested in the properties of a function {{math|''f''(''n'')}} as {{mvar|n}} becomes very large.  If {{math|''f''(''n'') {{=}} ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''n''}}, then as {{mvar|n}} becomes very large, the term {{math|3''n''}}  becomes insignificant compared to {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The function {{math|''f''(''n'')}} is said to be "''asymptotically equivalent'' to {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, as {{math|''n''&amp;nbsp;→ ∞}}". This is often written symbolically as {{math|''f''(''n'') ~ ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is read as "{{math|''f''(''n'')}} is asymptotic to {{math|''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}".

An example of an important asymptotic result is the [[prime&amp;nbsp;number theorem]]. The theorem states that if {{math|π(''x'')}} is the number of [[prime number]]s that are less than or equal to {{mvar|x}}, then

:&lt;math&gt;\pi(x)\sim\frac{x}{\log x}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Definition ==
Formally, given functions {{math|''f''(''x'')}} and {{math|''g''(''x'')}}, we define a binary relation
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \sim g(x) \quad (\text{as } x\to\infty)&lt;/math&gt;
if and only if {{Harv|de&amp;nbsp;Bruijn| 1981| loc= §1.4}}
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The symbol {{math|~}} is the [[tilde]]. The relation is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of functions of {{mvar|x}}; the functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} are said to be ''asymptotically equivalent''. The [[Domain of a function|domain]] of {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} can be any set for which the limit is defined: e.g. real numbers, complex numbers, positive integers.

The same notation is also used for other ways of passing to a limit: e.g. {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;→ 0}}, {{math|''x''&amp;nbsp;↓ 0}}, {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}&amp;nbsp;→ 0}}. The way of passing to the limit is often not stated explicitly, if it is clear from the context.

Although the above definition is common in the literature, it is problematic if {{math|''g''(''x'')}} is zero infinitely often as {{mvar|x}} goes to the limiting value. For that reason, some authors use an alternative definition. The alternative definition, in [[little-o notation]], is that {{math| ''f'' ~ ''g''}} if and only if 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) - g(x) = o(g(x)).&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is equivalent to the prior definition if {{math|''g''(''x'')}} is not zero in some [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of the limiting value.&lt;ref&gt;{{SpringerEOM |id=Asymptotic_equality| title=Asymptotic equality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Estrada|Kanwal|2002| loc=§1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
If &lt;math&gt;f \sim g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a \sim b&lt;/math&gt;, then under some mild conditions, the following hold.

* &lt;math&gt;f^r \sim g^r&lt;/math&gt;, for every real {{mvar|r}}
* &lt;math&gt;\log(f) \sim \log(g)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f\times a \sim g\times b&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;f / a \sim g / b&lt;/math&gt;

Such properties allow asymptotically-equivalent functions to be freely exchanged in many algebraic expressions.

==Examples of asymptotic formulas==
* [[Factorial]]
::&lt;math&gt;n! \sim \sqrt{2\pi n}\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt;
:—this is [[Stirling's approximation]]
* [[Partition (number theory)#Partition function|Partition function]]
:For a positive integer ''n'', the partition function, ''p''(''n''), gives the number of ways of writing the integer ''n'' as a sum of positive integers, where the order of addends is not considered.
::&lt;math&gt;p(n)\sim \frac{1}{4n\sqrt{3}} e^{\pi\sqrt{\frac{2n}{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Airy function]]
:The Airy function, Ai(''x''), is a solution of the differential equation &amp;thinsp;{{math|''y'''' − ''xy'' {{=}} 0}}; it has many applications in physics.
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ai}(x) \sim \frac{e^{-\frac{2}{3} x^\frac{3}{2}}}{2\sqrt{\pi} x^{1/4}}&lt;/math&gt;
* [[Hankel functions]]
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  H_\alpha^{(1)}(z) &amp;\sim \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}} e^{ i\left(z - \frac{2\pi\alpha - \pi}{4}\right)} \\
  H_\alpha^{(2)}(z) &amp;\sim \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}} e^{-i\left(z - \frac{2\pi\alpha - \pi}{4}\right)} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Asymptotic expansion==
{{main|Asymptotic expansion}}
An [[asymptotic expansion]] of a function {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is in practice an expression of that function in terms of a [[series (mathematics)|series]], the [[partial sum]]s of which do not necessarily converge, but such that taking any initial partial sum provides an asymptotic formula for {{mvar|f}}. The idea is that successive terms provide an increasingly accurate description of the order of growth of {{mvar|f}}.

In symbols, it means we have
:&lt;math&gt;f \sim g_1&lt;/math&gt;
but also
:&lt;math&gt;f - g_1 \sim g_2&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;f - g_1 - \cdots -  g_{k-1} \sim g_{k}&lt;/math&gt;
for each ''fixed'' {{math|''k''}}.

In view of the definition of the &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; symbol, the last equation means 
:&lt;math&gt;f - (g_1 + \cdots + g_k) = o(g_k)&lt;/math&gt;
in the [[Big O notation#Little-o notation|little o notation]], i.e., 
:&lt;math&gt;f - (g_1 + \cdots + g_k)&lt;/math&gt; is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;g_k&lt;/math&gt;.

The relation 
:&lt;math&gt;f - g_1 - \cdots -  g_{k-1} \sim g_{k}&lt;/math&gt; takes its full meaning if &lt;math&gt;\forall k, g_{k+1} = o(g_k)&lt;/math&gt;, 
which means the &lt;math&gt;g_k&lt;/math&gt; form an [[asymptotic scale]].

In that case, some authors may [[Abuse of notation|abusively]] write
:&lt;math&gt;f \sim g_1 + \cdots +  g_{k} &lt;/math&gt;
to denote the statement
:&lt;math&gt;f - (g_1 + \cdots + g_k) = o(g_k)\,.&lt;/math&gt;
One should however be careful that this is not a standard use of the &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; symbol, and that it does not correspond to the definition given in {{section link||Definition}}.

In the present situation, this relation &lt;math&gt;g_{k} = o(g_{k-1})&lt;/math&gt; actually follows from combining steps {{mvar|k}} and {{math|(''k'' − 1)}},
by subtracting &lt;math&gt;f - g_1 - \cdots -  g_{k-2} = g_{k-1} + o(g_{k-1})&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;f - g_1 - \cdots -  g_{k-2} -  g_{k-1} = g_{k} + o(g_{k})&lt;/math&gt; 
one gets
:&lt;math&gt;g_{k} + o(g_{k})=o(g_{k-1})\,,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e., &lt;math&gt;g_{k} = o(g_{k-1})&lt;/math&gt;.

In case the asymptotic expansion does not converge, for any particular value of the argument there will be a particular partial sum which provides the best approximation and adding additional terms will decrease the accuracy.  This optimal partial sum will usually have more terms as the argument approaches the limit value.

===Examples of asymptotic expansions===

* [[Gamma function]]

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{e^x}{x^x \sqrt{2\pi x}} \Gamma(x+1) \sim 1+\frac{1}{12x}+\frac{1}{288x^2}-\frac{139}{51840x^3}-\cdots
 \  (x \rightarrow \infty)&lt;/math&gt;

* [[Exponential integral]]

::&lt;math&gt;xe^xE_1(x) \sim \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^nn!}{x^n} \   (x \rightarrow \infty) &lt;/math&gt;

* [[Error function]]

::&lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\pi}x e^{x^2}{\rm erfc}(x) \sim 1+\sum_{n=1}^\infty (-1)^n \frac{(2n-1)!!}{n!(2x^2)^n} \ (x \rightarrow \infty)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;where {{math|(2''n''&amp;thinsp;−&amp;thinsp;1)!!}} is the [[double factorial]].

===Worked example===
Asymptotic expansions often occur when an ordinary series is used in a formal expression that forces the taking of values outside of its domain of convergence. For example, we might start with the ordinary series

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-w}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty w^n&lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the left is valid on the entire complex plane &lt;math&gt;w\ne 1&lt;/math&gt;, while the right hand side converges only for &lt;math&gt;|w|&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Multiplying by &lt;math&gt;e^{-w/t}&lt;/math&gt; and integrating both sides yields

:&lt;math&gt;
    \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-\frac{w}{t}}}{1 - w} \, dw 
  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty t^{n+1} \int_0^\infty e^{-u} u^n \, du
&lt;/math&gt;

The integral on the left hand side can be expressed in terms of the [[exponential integral]].  The integral on the right hand side, after the substitution &lt;math&gt;u=w/t&lt;/math&gt;, may be recognized as the [[gamma function]]. Evaluating both, one obtains the asymptotic expansion

:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\frac{1}{t}} \operatorname{Ei}\left(\frac{1}{t}\right) = \sum _{n=0}^\infty n! \; t^{n+1} &lt;/math&gt;

Here, the right hand side is clearly not convergent for any non-zero value of ''t''.  However, by keeping ''t'' small, and truncating the series on the right to a finite number of terms, one may obtain a fairly good approximation to the value of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ei}(1/t)&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting &lt;math&gt;x = -1/t&lt;/math&gt; and noting that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ei}(x) = -E_1(-x)&lt;/math&gt; results in the asymptotic expansion given earlier in this article.

== Asymptotic distribution ==
{{main|Asymptotic distribution}}

In [[mathematical statistics]], an '''[[asymptotic distribution]]''' is a hypothetical distribution that is in a sense the "limiting" distribution of a sequence of distributions. A distribution is an ordered set of random variables

:&lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt;

for &lt;math&gt;i = 1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, for some positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. An asymptotic distribution allows &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; to range without bound, that is, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is infinite.

A special case of an asymptotic distribution is when the late entries go to zero—that is, the {{math|''Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} go to 0 as {{mvar|i}} goes to infinity. Some instances of "asymptotic distribution" refer only to this special case.

This is based on the notion of an [[asymptotic]] function which cleanly approaches a constant value (the ''asymptote'') as the independent variable goes to infinity; "clean" in this sense meaning that for any desired closeness epsilon there is some value of the independent variable after which the function never differs from the constant by more than epsilon.

An [[asymptote]] is a straight line that a curve approaches but never meets or crosses. Informally, one may speak of the curve meeting the asymptote "at infinity" although this is not a precise definition. In the equation

:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{1}{x},&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily small in magnitude as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; increases.

==Applications==
Asymptotic analysis is used in several [[mathematical sciences]]. In [[statistics]], asymptotic theory  provides limiting approximations of the  [[probability distribution]] of [[sample statistic]]s, such as the [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio]] [[statistic]] and the [[expected value]] of the [[deviance (statistics)|deviance]]. Asymptotic theory does not provide a method of evaluating the finite-sample distributions of sample statistics, however. Non-asymptotic bounds are provided by methods of [[approximation theory]].

Examples of applications are the following.
* In [[applied mathematics]], asymptotic analysis is used to build [[numerical method]]s to approximate [[equation]] solutions.
* In [[mathematical statistics]] and  [[probability theory]], asymptotics are used in analysis of long-run or large-sample behaviour of random variables and estimators.
* in [[computer science]] in the [[analysis of algorithms]], considering the performance of algorithms.
* the behavior of [[physical system]]s, an example being [[statistical mechanics]].
* in [[accident analysis]] when identifying the causation of crash through count modeling with large number of crash counts in a given time and space.

Asymptotic analysis is a key tool for exploring the [[ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation|partial]] differential equations which arise in the [[mathematical model]]ling of real-world phenomena.&lt;ref name="Howison"&gt;Howison, S. (2005), ''Practical Applied Mathematics'', [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; An illustrative example is the derivation of the [[Boundary layer#Boundary layer equations|boundary layer equations]] from the full [[Navier-Stokes equations]] governing fluid flow. In many cases, the asymptotic expansion is in power of a small parameter,  {{mvar|ε}}: in the boundary layer case, this is the [[dimensional analysis|nondimensional]] ratio of the boundary layer thickness to a typical lengthscale of the problem. Indeed, applications of asymptotic analysis in mathematical modelling often&lt;ref name="Howison" /&gt; center around a nondimensional parameter which has been shown, or assumed, to be small through a consideration of the scales of the problem at hand.

Asymptotic expansions typically arise in the approximation of certain integrals ([[Laplace's method]], [[saddle-point method]], [[method of steepest descent]]) or in the approximation of probability distributions ([[Edgeworth series]]). The [[Feynman graphs]] in [[quantum field theory]] are another example of asymptotic expansions which often do not converge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5394">In [[physics]], [[engineering]] and [[materials science]], '''bi-isotropic materials''' have the special optical property that they can rotate the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light in either [[refraction]] or [[transmittance|transmission]]. This does not mean all materials with twist effect fall in the bi-isotropic class.  The twist effect of the class of bi-isotropic materials is caused by the [[Chirality (electromagnetism)|chirality]] and non-[[Reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity]] of the structure of the media, in which the electric and magnetic field of an [[electromagnetic wave]] (or simply, light) interact in an unusual way.

==Definition ==

For most materials, the [[electric field]] ''E'' and [[electric displacement]] field ''D'' (as well as the [[magnetic field]] ''B'' and [[magnetic field|inductive magnetic field]] ''H'') are parallel to one another. These simple mediums are called [[isotropic]], and the relationships between the fields can be expressed using constants. For more complex materials, such as crystals and many metamaterials, these fields are not necessarily parallel. When one set of the fields are parallel, and one set are not, the material is called [[anisotropic]]. Crystals typically have ''D'' fields which are not aligned with the ''E'' fields, while the ''B'' and ''H'' fields remain related by a constant. Materials where either pair of fields is not parallel are called anisotropic.

In bi-isotropic media, the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s are coupled. The [[constitutive relation]]s are 

:&lt;math&gt;D = \varepsilon E + \xi H\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B = \mu H + \zeta E\,&lt;/math&gt;

''D'', ''E'', ''B'', ''H'', ''ε'' and ''μ'' are corresponding to usual electromagnetic qualities. ''ξ'' and ''ζ'' are the coupling constants, which is the intrinsic constant of each media.

This can be generalized to the case where ''ε'', ''μ'', ''ξ'' and ''ζ'' are [[tensors]] (i.e. they depend on the direction within the material), in which case the media is referred to as ''bi-anisotropic''.&lt;ref&gt;

|year = 2010
|url = http://www.worldscibooks.com/physics/7515.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coupling constant ==

''ξ'' and ''ζ'' can be further related to the [[Bernard D. H. Tellegen|Tellegen]] (referred to as reciprocity) ''χ'' and [[chirality (electromagnetism)|chirality]] ''κ'' parameter

:&lt;math&gt;\chi - i \kappa = \frac{\xi }{\sqrt{\varepsilon \mu}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\chi + i \kappa = \frac{\zeta }{\sqrt{\varepsilon \mu}}&lt;/math&gt;

after substitution of the above equations into the constitutive relations, gives

:&lt;math&gt;D = \varepsilon E+ (\chi - i \kappa) \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu} H&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B = \mu H + (\chi + i \kappa) \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu} E&lt;/math&gt;

== Classification ==

== Examples ==

''Pasteur media'' can be made by mixing metal [[helices]] of one [[handedness]] into a resin. Care has been exercised to secure isotropy: the helices must be randomly oriented so that there is no special direction.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite book|last = Lakhtakia| first = Akhlesh
|title =Beltrami Fields in Chiral Media| work =Nobel Lecture| publisher = World Scientific |location=Singapore

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electromagnetic Waves in Chiral and Bi-isotropic Media |first1=I.V. |last1=Lindell |first2=A.H. |last2=Shivola |first3=S.A. |last3=Tretyakov |first4=A.J. |last4=Viitanen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetoelectric effect can be understood from the helix as it is exposed to the electromagnetic field. the helix geometry is a sort of [[inductor]]. The magnetic component of an EM wave induces a current on the wire and further influence the electric component of the same EM wave. 

From the constitutive relations, for Pasteur media, ''χ'' = 0,

:&lt;math&gt;D = \varepsilon E - i \kappa \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu} H&lt;/math&gt;

the ''D'' field was delayed the respond from the ''H''-field by a phase ''i''.

''Tellegen media'' is an opposite of Pasteur media, which is electromagnetic: the electric component will cause the magnetic component to change. such a medium is not as straightforward as the concept of handedness. [[Electric dipole]]s bonded with magnets belong to this kind of media. when the dipoles are turned by the electric part of an EM wave, the magnets will also be changed, due to the fact that they are bounded together. The change of magnets direction will change the magnetic component of the same EM wave.

from the constitutive relations, for Tellegen media, ''κ'' = 0, 

:&lt;math&gt;B = \mu H + \chi \sqrt{\varepsilon \mu} E&lt;/math&gt;

The ''D'' field was responded immediately from the ''H''-field.

'''Blockhead''' is the name of a theoretical [[computer]] system invented as part of a [[thought experiment]] by [[philosopher]] [[Ned Block]], which appeared in a paper titled "[[Psychologism]] and [[Behaviorism]]" (though Block does not name the computer in the paper). 

==Overview==
In "Psychologism and Behaviorism," Block argues that the internal mechanism of a system is important in determining whether that system is [[intelligent]] and claims to show that a non-intelligent system could pass the [[Turing test]].

Block asks us to imagine a conversation lasting any given amount of time. He states that given the nature of language, there are a finite number of [[syntax|syntactically]]- and [[grammar|grammatically]]-correct sentences that can be used to start a conversation. Consequently, there is a limit to how many "sensible" responses can be made to the first sentence, then to the second sentence, and so on until the conversation ends.

Block then asks the reader to imagine a computer which had been programmed with all the sentences in theory, if not in practice. Block argues that such a machine could continue a conversation with a person on any topic because the computer would be programmed with every sentence that it was possible to use so the computer would be able to pass the Turing test despite the fact, according to Block, that it was not intelligent.

Block says that this does not show that there is only one correct internal structure for generating intelligence but simply that some internal structures do not generate intelligence.

The argument is related to [[John Searle]]'s [[Chinese room]].

A recent objection to the Blockhead argument is Hanoch Ben-Yami (2005), who agrees that Block's machine lacks intelligence but compares its answers to a poetic dialogue in which one man is whispered romantic poetry to recite to his would-be lover as it answers only what it has been told to answer in advance by its programmers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11131">In [[computer science]] and [[graph theory]], the '''Canadian traveller problem''' ('''CTP''') is a generalization of the [[shortest path problem]] to graphs that are ''partially observable''. In other words, the graph is revealed while it is being explored, and explorative edges are charged even if they do not contribute to the final path.

This [[optimization problem]] was introduced by  [[Christos Papadimitriou]] and [[Mihalis Yannakakis]] in 1989 and a number of variants of the problem have been studied since. The name supposedly originates from conversations of the authors who learned of the difficulty Canadian drivers had - traveling a network of cities with snowfall randomly blocking roads. The stochastic version, where each edge is associated with a probability of independently being in the graph, has been given considerable attention in [[operations research]] under the name "the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse" (SSPPR).

== Problem description ==

{{expand section|date=February 2017}}

For a given instance, there are a number of possibilities, or ''realizations'', of how the hidden graph may look. Given an instance, a description of how to follow the instance in the best way is called a ''policy''. The CTP task is to compute the expected cost of the optimal policies. To compute an actual description of an optimal policy may be a harder problem.

Given an instance and policy for the instance, every realization produces its own (deterministic) walk in the graph. Note that the walk is not necessarily a [[glossary of graph theory|path]] since the best strategy may be to, e.g., visit every vertex of a cycle and return to the start. This differs from the [[shortest path problem]] (with strictly positive weights), where repetitions in a walk implies that a better solution exists.

== Variants ==
There are primarily five parameters distinguishing the number of variants of the Canadian Traveller Problem. The first parameter is how to value the walk produced by a policy for a given instance and realization. In the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse, the goal is simply to minimize the cost of the walk (defined as the sum over all edges of the cost of the edge times the number of times that edge was taken). For the Canadian Traveller Problem, the task is to minimize the [[competitive ratio]] of the walk; i.e., to minimize the number of times longer the produced walk is to the shortest path in the realization.

The second parameter is how to evaluate a policy with respect to different realizations consistent with the instance under consideration. In the Canadian Traveller Problem, one wishes to study the [[worst case]] and in SSPPR, the [[average case]]. For average case analysis, one must furthermore specify an [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]] distribution over the realizations.

The third parameter is restricted to the stochastic versions and is about what assumptions we can make about the distribution of the realizations and how the distribution is represented in the input. In the Stochastic Canadian Traveller Problem and in the Edge-independent Stochastic Shortest Path Problem (i-SSPPR), each uncertain edge (or cost) has an associated probability of being in the realization and the event that an edge is in the graph is independent of which other edges are in the realization. Even though this is a considerable simplification, the problem is still [[sharp P|#P]]-hard. Another variant is to make no assumption on the distribution but require that each realization with non-zero probability be explicitly stated (such as “Probability 0.1 of edge set { {3,4},{1,2} }, probability 0.2 of...”). This is called the Distribution Stochastic Shortest Path Problem (d-SSPPR or R-SSPPR) and is NP-complete. The first variant is harder than the second because the former can represent in logarithmic space some distributions that the latter represents in linear space.

The fourth and final parameter is how the graph changes over time. In CTP and SSPPR, the realization is fixed but not known. In the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse and Resets or the Expected Shortest Path problem, a new realization is chosen from the distribution after each step taken by the policy. This problem can be solved in polynomial time by reducing it to a Markov decision process with polynomial horizon. The Markov generalization, where the realization of the graph may influence the next realization, is known to be much harder.

An additional parameter is how new knowledge is being discovered on the realization. In traditional variants of CTP, the agent uncovers the exact weight (or status) of an edge upon reaching an adjacent vertex. A new variant was recently suggested where an agent also has the ability to perform remote sensing from any location on the realization. In this variant, the task is to minimize the travel cost plus the cost of sensing operations.

==Formal definition==
We define the variant studied in the paper from 1989. That is, the goal is to minimize the competitive ratio in the worst case. It is necessary that we begin by introducing certain terms.

Consider a given graph and the family of undirected graphs that can be constructed by adding one or more edges from a given set. Formally, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}(V,E,F) = \{(V,E+F') | F' \subseteq F\}, E \cap F = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; where we think of ''E'' as the edges that must be in the graph and of ''F'' as the edges that may be in the graph. We say that &lt;math&gt;G \in \mathcal{G}(V,E,F)&lt;/math&gt; is a ''realization'' of the graph family. Furthermore, let W be an associated cost matrix where &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of going from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'', assuming that this edge is in the realization.

For any vertex ''v'' in ''V'', we call &lt;math&gt;E_B(v,V)&lt;/math&gt; its incident edges with respect to the edge set ''B'' on ''V''. Furthermore, for a realization &lt;math&gt;G \in \mathcal{G}(V,E,F)&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;d_B(s,t)&lt;/math&gt; be the cost of the shortest path in the graph from ''s'' to ''t''. This is called the off-line problem because an algorithm for such a problem would have complete information of the graph.

We say that a strategy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; to navigate such a graph is a mapping from &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{P}(E),\mathcal{P}(F),V)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[powerset]] of ''X''. We define the cost &lt;math&gt;c(\pi, B)&lt;/math&gt; of a strategy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; with respect to a particular realization &lt;math&gt;G = (V,B)&lt;/math&gt; as follows.
* Let &lt;math&gt;v_0 = s, E_0 = E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_0 = F&lt;/math&gt;.
* For &lt;math&gt;i = 0, 1, 2, ...&lt;/math&gt;, define
** &lt;math&gt;E_{i+1} = E_i \cup E_B(v_i,V)&lt;/math&gt;,
** &lt;math&gt;F_{i+1} = F_i - E_F(v_i,V)&lt;/math&gt;, and
** &lt;math&gt;v_{i+1} = \pi(E_{i+1}, F_{i+1}, v_i)&lt;/math&gt;.
* If there exists a ''T'' such that &lt;math&gt;v_T = t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;c(\pi, B) = \sum_{i=0}^{T-1} w_{v_i,v_{i+1}}&lt;/math&gt;; otherwise let &lt;math&gt;c(\pi, B) = \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

In other words, we evaluate the policy based on the edges we currently know are in the graph (&lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;) and the edges we know might be in the graph (&lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;). When we take a step in the graph, the edges incident to our new location become known to us. Those edges that are in the graph are added to &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt;, and regardless of whether the edges are in the graph or not, they are removed from the set of unknown edges, &lt;math&gt;F_i&lt;/math&gt;. If the goal is never reached, we say that we have an infinite cost. If the goal is reached, we define the cost of the walk as the sum of the costs of all of the edges traversed, with cardinality.

Finally, we define the Canadian traveller problem.
: Given a CTP instance &lt;math&gt;(V,E,F,s,t,r)&lt;/math&gt;, decide whether there exists a policy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; such that for every realization &lt;math&gt;(V,B) \in \mathcal{G}(V,E,F)&lt;/math&gt;, the cost &lt;math&gt;c(\pi, B)&lt;/math&gt; of the policy is no more than ''r'' times the off-line optimal, &lt;math&gt;d_B(s, t)&lt;/math&gt;.

Papadimitriou and Yannakakis noted that this defines a [[game theory|two-player game]], where the players compete over the cost of their respective paths and the edge set is chosen by the second player (nature).

==Complexity==
The original paper analysed the complexity of the problem and reported it to be [[PSPACE-complete]]. It was also shown that finding an optimal path in the case where each edge has an associated probability of being in the graph (i-SSPPR) is a PSPACE-easy but [[sharp-P|♯P]]-hard problem.&lt;ref&gt;Papadimitriou and Yannakakis, 1989, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; It was an open problem to bridge this gap, but since then both the directed and undirected versions were shown to be PSPACE-hard.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Shimony, Benbassat, and Wenner 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The directed version of the stochastic problem is known in [[operations research]] as the Stochastic Shortest Path Problem with Recourse.

==Applications==
The problem is said to have applications in [[operations research]], transportation planning, [[artificial intelligence]], [[machine learning]], communication networks, and routing. A variant of the problem has been studied for robot navigation with probabilistic landmark recognition.&lt;ref name=briggs04&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Amy J. |last1=Briggs |first2=Carrick |last2=Detweiler |first3=Daniel |last3=Scharstein |title=Expected shortest paths for landmark-based robot navigation |journal="International Journal of Robotics Research" |year=2004 |volume=23 |pages=717–718 |doi=10.1177/0278364904045467 |issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open problems==
Despite the age of the problem and its many potential applications, many natural questions still remain open. Is there a constant-factor approximation or is the problem [[APX]]-hard? Is i-SSPPR #P-complete? An even more fundamental question has been left unanswered: is there a polynomial-size ''description'' of an optimal policy, setting aside for a moment the time necessary to compute the description?&lt;ref&gt;Karger and Nikolova, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classical control theory''' is a branch of [[control theory]] that deals with the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s with inputs, and how their behavior is modified by [[feedback]], using the [[Laplace transform]] as a basic tool to model such systems.

The usual objective of control theory is to control a system, often called the ''[[Plant (control theory)|plant]]'', so its output follows a desired control signal, called the ''[[reference]]'', which may be a fixed or changing value.  To do this a ''[[Controller (control theory)|controller]]'' is designed, which monitors the output and compares it with the reference.  The difference between actual and desired output, called the ''error'' signal, is applied as [[feedback]] to the input of the system, to bring the actual output closer to the reference.

Classical control theory deals with [[linear time-invariant system|linear time-invariant]] [[single-input single-output]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zhong|first1=Wan-Xie|title=Duality System in Applied Mechanics and Optimal Control|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer|isbn=978-1-4020-7880-4|page=283|quote=The classical controller design methodology is iterative, and is effective for single-input, single-output linear time-invariant system analysis and design.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laplace transform of the input and output signal of such systems can be calculated. The [[transfer function]] relates the Laplace transform of the input and the output.

==Feedback==

To overcome the limitations of the [[open-loop controller]], classical control theory introduces [[feedback]]. A [[closed-loop controller]] uses feedback to control [[state (controls)|states]] or [[Negative feedback#Overview|output]]s of a [[dynamical system]]. Its name comes from the information path in the system: process inputs (e.g., [[voltage]] applied to an [[electric motor]]) have an effect on the process outputs (e.g., speed or torque of the motor), which is measured with [[sensor]]s and processed by the controller; the result (the control signal) is "fed back" as input to the process, closing the loop.

Closed-loop controllers have the following advantages over [[open-loop controller]]s:
* disturbance rejection (such as hills in the cruise control example above)
* guaranteed performance even with [[mathematical model|model]] uncertainties, when the model structure does not match perfectly the real process and the model parameters are not exact
* [[instability|unstable]] processes can be stabilized
* reduced sensitivity to parameter variations
* improved reference tracking performance

In some systems, closed-loop and open-loop control are used simultaneously. In such systems, the open-loop control is termed [[feed forward (control)|feedforward]] and serves to further improve reference tracking performance.

A common closed-loop controller architecture is the [[PID controller]].

==Classical vs modern==

A Physical system can be modeled in the "time domain", where the response of a given system is a function of the various inputs, the previous system values, and time. As time progresses, the state of the system and its response change. However, time-domain models for systems are frequently modeled using high-order differential equations which can become impossibly difficult for humans to solve and some of which can even become impossible for modern computer systems to solve efficiently.

To counteract this problem, classical control theory uses the [[Laplace transform]] to change an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the time domain into a regular algebraic polynomial in the transform domain. Once a given system has been converted into the transform domain it can be manipulated with greater ease.

[[Modern control theory]], instead of changing domains to avoid the complexities of time-domain ODE mathematics, converts the differential equations into a system of lower-order time domain equations called [[state space (control)|state equations]], which can then be manipulated using techniques from linear algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogata|first1=Katsuhiko|title=Modern Control Systems|date=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-615673-4|page=2|edition=Fifth|quote=modern control theory, based on time-domain analysis and synthesis using state variables}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laplace transform==
{{main|Laplace transform}}

Classical control theory uses the Laplace transform to model the systems and signals. The Laplace transform is a frequency-domain approach for continuous time signals irrespective of whether the system is stable or unstable. The Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by
: &lt;math&gt;F(s) =\int_0^\infty e^{-st} f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter
: &lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + i \omega&lt;/math&gt;, with real numbers {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''ω''}}.

==Closed-loop transfer function==
{{details|closed-loop transfer function}}
The output of the system ''y(t)'' is fed back through a sensor measurement ''F'' to the reference value ''r(t)''. The controller ''C'' then takes the error ''e'' (difference) between the reference and the output to change the inputs ''u'' to the system under control ''P''. This is shown in the figure. This kind of controller is a closed-loop controller or feedback controller.

This is called a single-input-single-output (''SISO'') control system; ''MIMO'' (i.e., Multi-Input-Multi-Output) systems, with more than one input/output, are common. In such cases variables are represented through [[coordinate vector|vectors]] instead of simple [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] values. For some [[distributed parameter systems]] the vectors may be infinite-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] (typically functions).

[[File:simple feedback control loop2.svg|center|A simple feedback control loop]]

If we assume the controller ''C'', the plant ''P'', and the sensor ''F'' are [[linear]] and [[time-invariant]] (i.e., elements of their [[transfer function]] ''C(s)'', ''P(s)'', and ''F(s)'' do not depend on time), the systems above can be analysed using the [[Laplace transform]] on the variables. This gives the following relations:

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = P(s) U(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;U(s) = C(s) E(s)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E(s) = R(s) - F(s)Y(s).\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''Y''(''s'') in terms of ''R''(''s'') gives

: &lt;math&gt;Y(s) = \left( \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)} \right) R(s) = H(s)R(s).&lt;/math&gt;

The expression &lt;math&gt;H(s) = \frac{P(s)C(s)}{1 + F(s)P(s)C(s)}&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the ''closed-loop transfer function'' of the system. The numerator is the forward (open-loop) gain from ''r'' to ''y'', and the denominator is one plus the gain in going around the feedback loop, the so-called loop gain. If &lt;math&gt;|P(s)C(s)| \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., it has a large [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] with each value of ''s'', and if &lt;math&gt;|F(s)| \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Y(s)'' is approximately equal to ''R(s)'' and the output closely tracks the reference input.

==PID controller==
{{details|PID controller}}
The [[PID controller]] is probably the most-used feedback control design. ''PID'' is an initialism for ''Proportional-Integral-Derivative'', referring to the three terms operating on the error signal to produce a control signal. If ''u(t)'' is the control signal sent to the system, ''y(t)'' is the measured output and ''r(t)'' is the desired output, and tracking error &lt;math&gt;e(t)=r(t)- y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, a PID controller has the general form

:&lt;math&gt;u(t) =  K_P e(t) + K_I \int e(t)\text{d}t + K_D \frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}e(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The desired closed loop dynamics is obtained by adjusting the three parameters &lt;math&gt; K_P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_D&lt;/math&gt;, often iteratively by "tuning" and without specific knowledge of a plant model. Stability can often be ensured using only the proportional term. The integral term permits the rejection of a step disturbance (often a striking specification in [[process control]]). The derivative term is used to provide damping or shaping of the response. PID controllers are the most well established class of control systems: however, they cannot be used in several more complicated cases, especially if multiple-input multiple-output systems (MIMO) systems are considered.

Applying Laplace transformation results in the transformed PID controller equation

:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  K_P e(s) + K_I \frac{1}{s} e(s) + K_D s e(s)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u(s) =  \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right) e(s)&lt;/math&gt;

with the PID controller transfer function
:&lt;math&gt;C(s) = \left(K_P + K_I \frac{1}{s} + K_D s\right).&lt;/math&gt;
There exists a nice example of the closed-loop system discussed above. If we take

PID controller transfer function in series form

:&lt;math&gt;C(s) =  K \left(1 + \frac{1}{sT_i}\right)(1 + sT_d)&lt;/math&gt;

1st order filter in feedback loop

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = \frac{1}{1 + sT_f}&lt;/math&gt;

linear actuator with filtered input

:&lt;math&gt;P(s) = \frac{A}{1 + sT_p}&lt;/math&gt;,   A = const

and insert all this into expression for closed-loop transfer function H(s), then tuning is very easy: simply put

:&lt;math&gt;K = \frac{1}{A},   T_i = T_f,   T_d = T_p&lt;/math&gt;

and get H(s) = 1 identically.

For practical PID controllers, a pure differentiator is neither physically realisable nor desirable&lt;ref&gt;Ang, K.H., Chong, G.C.Y., and Li, Y. (2005). [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1453566 PID control system analysis, design, and technology, ''IEEE Trans Control Systems Tech'', 13(4), pp.559-576].&lt;/ref&gt; due to amplification of noise and resonant modes in the system. Therefore, a phase-lead compensator type approach is used instead, or a differentiator with low-pass roll-off.

==Tools==

Classical control theory uses an array of tools to analyze systems and design controllers for such systems. Tools include the [[root locus]], the [[Nyquist stability criterion]], the [[Bode plot]], the [[gain margin]] and [[phase margin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14221">{{Other uses|Closure (disambiguation)}}
A [[Set (mathematics)|set]] has '''closure''' under an [[Operation (mathematics)|operation]] if performance of that operation on members of the set always produces a member of the same set; in this case we also say that the set is '''closed''' under the operation. For example, the positive [[integers]] are closed under addition, but not under subtraction: &lt;math&gt;1 - 2&lt;/math&gt; is not a positive integer even though both 1 and 2 are positive integers. Another example is the set containing only zero, which is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication (because &lt;math&gt;0+0=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0-0=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;0\times{0}=0&lt;/math&gt;).

Similarly, a set is said to be '''closed under a ''collection'' of operations''' if it is closed under each of the operations individually.

==Basic properties==
A set that is closed under an operation or collection of operations is said to satisfy a '''closure property'''. Often a closure property is introduced as an [[axiom]], which is then usually called the '''axiom of closure'''.  Modern set-theoretic definitions usually define operations as maps between sets, so adding closure to a structure as an axiom is superfluous; however in practice operations are often defined initially on a superset of the set in question and a closure proof is required to establish that the operation applied to pairs from that set only produces members of that set. For example, the set of even integers is closed under addition, but the set of odd integers is not.

When a set ''S'' is not closed under some operations, one can usually find the smallest set containing ''S'' that is closed.  This smallest closed set is called the '''closure''' of ''S'' (with respect to these operations).  For example, the closure under subtraction of the set of natural numbers, viewed as a subset of the real numbers, is the set of [[integers]].  An important example is that of [[topological closure]]. The notion of closure is generalized by [[Galois connection]], and further by [[monad (category theory)|monad]]s.

The set ''S'' must be a subset of a closed set in order for the closure operator to be defined.  In the preceding example, it is important that the reals are closed under subtraction; in the domain of the natural numbers subtraction is not always defined.

The two uses of the word "closure" should not be confused.  The former usage refers to the property of being closed, and the latter refers to the smallest closed set containing one that may not be closed.  In short, the closure of a set satisfies a closure property.

==Closed sets==
A set is closed under an operation if the operation returns a member of the set when evaluated on members of the set.  Sometimes the requirement that the operation be valued in a set is explicitly stated, in which case it is known as the '''axiom of closure'''.  For example, one may define a [[group (mathematics)|group]] as a set with a binary product operator obeying several axioms, including an axiom that the product of any two elements of the group is again an element.  However the modern definition of an operation makes this axiom superfluous; an [[arity|''n''-ary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]] on ''S'' is just a subset of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  By its very definition, an operator on a set cannot have values outside the set.

Nevertheless, the closure property of an operator on a set still has some utility.  Closure on a set does not necessarily imply closure on all subsets.  Thus a [[subgroup]] of a group is a subset on which the binary product and the [[unary operation]] of [[inverse element|inversion]] satisfy the closure axiom.

An operation of a different sort is that of finding the [[limit point]]s of a subset of a [[topological space]] (if the space is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it suffices to restrict consideration to the [[limit of a sequence|limits of sequences]] but in general  one must consider at least limits of [[net (mathematics)|nets]]).  A set that is closed under this operation is usually just referred to as a [[closed set]] in the context of [[topology]].  Without any further qualification, the phrase usually means closed in this sense.   [[Closed interval]]s like [1,2] = {''x'' : 1 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 2} are closed in this sense.

A partially ordered set is '''downward closed''' (and also called a [[upper set|lower set]]) if for every element of the set all smaller elements are also in it; this applies for example for the real intervals (&amp;minus;∞,&amp;nbsp;''p'') and (&amp;minus;∞,&amp;nbsp;''p''], and for an [[ordinal number]] ''p'' represented as interval [ 0,&amp;nbsp;''p''); every downward closed set of ordinal numbers is itself an ordinal number.

'''Upward closed''' and upper set are defined similarly.

==Examples==
* In [[topology]] and related branches, the relevant operation is taking limits.  The [[topological closure]] of a set is the corresponding closure operator.  The [[Kuratowski closure axioms]] characterize this operator.
* In [[linear algebra]], the [[linear span]] of a set ''X'' of vectors is the '''closure''' of that set; it is the smallest subset of the [[vector space]] that includes ''X'' and is closed under the operation of [[linear combination]].  This subset is a [[linear subspace|subspace]].
* In [[matroid]] theory, the closure of ''X'' is the largest superset of ''X'' that has the same rank as ''X''.
* In [[set theory]], the [[Transitive_set#Transitive_closure|transitive closure]] of a [[set (mathematics)|set]].
* In [[set theory]], the [[transitive closure]] of a [[binary relation]].
* In [[abstract algebra|algebra]], the [[algebraic closure]] of a [[field (algebra)|field]].
* In [[commutative algebra]], closure operations for ideals, as [[integral closure]] and [[tight closure]].
* In [[geometry]], the [[convex hull]] of a set ''S'' of points is the smallest [[convex set]] of which ''S'' is a [[subset]].
* In [[formal language]]s, the [[Kleene closure]] of a language can be described as the set of strings that can be made by concatenating zero or more strings from that language.
* In [[group theory]], the [[conjugate closure]] or normal closure of a set of [[group (mathematics)|group]] elements is the smallest normal subgroup containing the set.
* In [[mathematical analysis]] and in [[probability theory]], the closure of a collection of subsets of ''X'' under [[countable|countably many]] [[algebra of sets|set operations]] is called the [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by the collection.

==Closure operator==
:{{Main|closure operator}}
Given an operation on a set ''X'', one can define the closure ''C''(''S'') of a subset ''S'' of ''X'' to be the smallest subset closed under that operation that contains ''S'' as a subset, if any such subsets exist.  Consequently, ''C''(''S'') is the intersection of all closed sets containing ''S''. For example, the closure of a subset of a group is the subgroup [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by that set.

The closure of sets with respect to some operation defines a '''closure operator''' on the subsets of ''X''.  The closed sets can be determined from the closure operator; a set is closed if it is equal to its own closure.  Typical structural properties of all closure operations are: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkhoff |first=Garrett |authorlink=Garrett Birkhoff |date=1967 |title=Lattice Theory |volume=25 |publisher=Am. Math. Soc. |series=Colloquium Publications |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The closure is '''increasing''' or '''extensive''': the closure of an object contains the object.
*The closure is '''[[idempotent]]''': the closure of the closure equals the closure.
*The closure is '''monotone''', that is, if ''X'' is contained in ''Y'', then also ''C''(''X'') is contained in ''C''(''Y'').

An object that is its own closure is called '''closed'''.  By idempotency, an object is closed [[if and only if]] it is the closure of some object.

These three properties define an '''abstract closure operator'''.  Typically, an abstract closure acts on the class of all subsets of a set.

If ''X'' is contained in a set closed under the operation then every subset of ''X'' has a closure.

==Binary relation closures==
Consider first [[homogeneous relation]]s ''R'' ⊆ ''A'' × ''A''. If a relation ''S'' satisfies ''aSb'' ⇒ ''bSa'', then it is a [[symmetric relation]]. An arbitrary homogeneous relation ''R'' may not be symmetric but it is always contained in some symmetric relation: ''R'' ⊆ ''S''. The operation of finding the ''smallest'' such ''S'' corresponds to a closure operator called [[symmetric closure]].

A [[transitive relation]] ''T'' satisfies ''aTb'' ∧ ''bTc'' ⇒ ''aTc''. An arbitrary homogeneous relation ''R'' may not be transitive but it is always contained in some transitive relation: ''R'' ⊆ ''T''. The operation of finding the ''smallest'' such ''T'' corresponds to a closure operator called [[transitive closure]].

Among [[heterogeneous relation]]s there are properties of ''difunctionality'' and ''contact'' which lead to '''difunctional closure''' and '''contact closure'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gunther Schmidt]] (2011) ''Relational Mathematics'', pages 169 and 227, Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications, vol. 132, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-521-76268-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of these closure operators in binary relations leads to [[topology]] since open-set axioms may be replaced by [[Kuratowski closure axioms]]. Thus each property ''P'', symmetry, transitivity, difunctionality, or contact corresponds to a relational topology.&lt;ref&gt;Gunter Schmidt and M. Winter (2018) ''Relational Topology'', [[Lecture Notes in Mathematics]] vol. 2208, Springer Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-319-74451-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the theory of [[rewriting]] systems, one often uses more wordy notions such as the '''reflexive transitive closure''' ''R&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;mdash;the smallest [[preorder]] containing ''R'', or the '''reflexive transitive symmetric closure''' ''R''&lt;sup&gt;≡&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;mdash;the [[Equivalence_relation#Comparing_equivalence_relations|smallest equivalence relation]] containing ''R'', and therefore also known as the '''equivalence closure'''. When considering a particular [[term algebra]], an equivalence relation that is compatible with all operations of the algebra &lt;ref group=note&gt;that is, such that e.g. ''xRy'' implies ''f''(''x'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ''R'' ''f''(''y'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x'') ''R'' ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y'') for any binary operation ''f'' and arbitrary ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S''&lt;/ref&gt; is called a [[Congruence relation#Universal algebra|congruence relation]]. The '''congruence closure''' of ''R'' is defined as the smallest congruence relation containing ''R''.

For arbitrary ''P'' and ''R'', the ''P'' closure of ''R'' need not exist. In the above examples, these exist because reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry are closed under arbitrary intersections. In such cases, the ''P'' closure can be directly defined as the intersection of all sets with property ''P'' containing ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baader |first1=Franz |authorlink1=Franz Baader |last2=Nipkow |first2=Tobias |authorlink2=Tobias Nipkow |date=1998 |title=Term Rewriting and All That |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=8–9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7BvXVUCQk8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important particular closures can be constructively obtained as follows:
* ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''x'',''x''⟩ : ''x'' ∈ ''S'' } is the [[reflexive closure]] of ''R'',
* ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''y'',''x''⟩ : ⟨''x'',''y''⟩ ∈ ''R'' } is its symmetric closure,
* ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;trn&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;⟩ : ''n'' &gt;1 ∧ ⟨''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;⟩, ..., ⟨''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;⟩ ∈ ''R'' } is its [[transitive closure]],
* ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;emb,Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') = ''R'' ∪ { ⟨''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''-1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''-1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y'',''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)⟩ : ⟨''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''⟩ ∈ ''R'' ∧ ''f'' ∈ Σ ''n''-ary ∧ 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'' ∧ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ ''S'' } is its embedding closure with respect to a given set Σ of operations on ''S'', each with a fixed arity.
The relation ''R'' is said to have closure under some ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;xxx&lt;/sub&gt;, if ''R'' = ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;xxx&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''); for example ''R'' is called symmetric if ''R'' = ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').

Any of these four closures preserves symmetry, i.e., if ''R'' is symmetric, so is any ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;xxx&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''). &lt;ref group=note&gt;formally: if ''R'' = ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), then ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;xxx&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') = ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;xxx&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''))&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, all four preserve reflexivity.
Moreover, ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;trn&lt;/sub&gt; preserves closure under ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;emb,Σ&lt;/sub&gt; for arbitrary Σ.
As a consequence, the equivalence closure of an arbitrary binary relation ''R'' can be obtained as ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;trn&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''))), and the congruence closure with respect to some Σ can be obtained as ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;trn&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;emb,Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')))). In the latter case, the nesting order does matter; e.g. if ''S'' is the set of terms over Σ = { ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''f'' } and ''R'' = { ⟨''a'',''b''⟩, ⟨''f''(''b''),''c''⟩ }, then the pair ⟨''f''(''a''),''c''⟩ is contained in the congruence closure ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;trn&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;emb,Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')))) of ''R'', but not in the relation ''cl''&lt;sub&gt;emb,Σ&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;trn&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;sym&lt;/sub&gt;(''cl''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')))).

In [[digital logic]] and [[computing]], a '''counter''' is a device which stores (and sometimes displays) the number of times a particular [[event (philosophy)|event]] or [[Process (computing)|process]] has occurred, often in relationship to a [[clock signal]].  The most common type is a [[sequential logic|sequential]] [[digital logic]] circuit with an input line called the  ''clock''  and multiple output lines.  The values on the output lines represent a number in the [[binary number|binary]] or [[binary coded decimal|BCD]] number system. Each pulse applied to the clock input [[:wikt:increment|increment]]s or [[:wikt:decrement|decrement]]s the number in the counter.

A counter circuit is usually constructed of a number of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]] connected in cascade. Counters are a very widely used component in [[digital circuit]]s, and are manufactured as separate [[integrated circuit]]s and  also incorporated as parts of larger integrated circuits.

== Electronic counters ==
In [[electronics]], counters can be implemented quite easily using register-type circuits such as the [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], and a wide variety of classified  into:
* Asynchronous (ripple) counter – changing state bits are used as clocks to subsequent state flip-flops
* Synchronous counter – all state bits change under control of a single clock
* Decade counter – counts through ten states per stage
* Up/down counter – counts both up and down, under command of a control input
* Ring counter – formed by a [[shift register]] with feedback connection in a ring
* Johnson counter – a ''twisted'' ring counter
* Cascaded counter
* Modulus counter.

Each is useful for different applications. Usually, counter circuits are [[Digital data|digital]] in nature, and count in [[binary numeral system|natural binary]]. Many types of counter circuits are available as digital building blocks, for example a number of chips in the [[4000 series|4500 series]] implement different counters.

Occasionally there are advantages to using a counting sequence other than the natural binary sequence—such as the [[binary coded decimal]] counter, a [[linear-feedback shift register#Uses as counters|linear-feedback shift register]] counter, or a [[Gray Code#Gray code counters and arithmetic|Gray-code]] counter.

Counters are useful for digital clocks and timers, and in oven timers, VCR clocks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Digital | publisher = Play hookey | contribution = Synchronous counter | url = http://www.play-hookey.com/digital/synchronous_counter.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asynchronous (ripple) counter ===
[[File:Asynchronous-counter2.svg|thumb|200px|right|Asynchronous counter created from two [[JK flip-flop]]s]]

An asynchronous (ripple) counter is a single [[Flip-flop (electronics)#D flip-flop|d-type flip-flop]], with its J (data) input fed from its own inverted output. This circuit can store one bit, and hence can count from zero to one before it overflows (starts over from 0). This counter will increment once for every clock cycle and takes two clock cycles to overflow, so every cycle it will alternate between a transition from 0 to 1 and a transition from 1 to 0. Notice that this creates a new clock with a 50% [[duty cycle]] at exactly half the frequency of the input clock. If this output is then used as the clock signal for a similarly arranged D flip-flop (remembering to invert the output to the input), one will get another 1 bit counter that counts half as fast. Putting them together yields a two-bit counter:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Cycle !! Q1 !! Q0 !! (Q1:Q0)dec
|-
| 0 || 0 || 0  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 || 1  || 1
|-
| 2 || 1 || 0  || 2
|-
| 3 || 1 || 1  || 3
|-
| 4 || 0 || 0  || 0
|}

You can continue to add additional flip-flops, always inverting the output to its own input, and using the output from the previous flip-flop as the clock signal. The result is called a ripple counter, which can count to {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; - 1}} where ''n'' is the number of bits (flip-flop stages) in the counter. Ripple counters suffer from unstable outputs as the overflows "ripple" from stage to stage, but they do find frequent application as dividers for clock signals, where the instantaneous count is unimportant, but the division [[ratio]] overall is (to clarify this, a 1-bit counter is exactly equivalent to a divide by two circuit; the output frequency is exactly half that of the input when fed with a regular train of clock pulses).

The use of flip-flop outputs as clocks leads to timing skew between the count data bits, making this ripple technique incompatible with normal [[synchronous circuit]] design styles.

=== Synchronous counter ===
[[File:4-bit-jk-flip-flop V1.1.svg|thumb|400px|right|A 4-bit synchronous counter using JK flip-flops]]

In synchronous counters, the clock inputs of all the flip-flops are connected together and are triggered by the input pulses.  Thus, all the flip-flops change state simultaneously (in parallel).  The circuit below is a 4-bit synchronous counter.  The J and K inputs of FF0 are connected to HIGH.  FF1 has its J and K inputs connected to the output of FF0, and the J and K inputs of FF2 are connected to the output of an AND gate that is fed by the outputs of FF0 and FF1.
A simple way of implementing the logic for each bit of an ascending counter (which is what is depicted in the adjacent image) is for each bit to toggle when all of the less significant bits are at a logic high state.  For example, bit 1 toggles when bit 0 is logic high; bit 2 toggles when both bit 1 and bit 0 are logic high; bit 3 toggles when bit 2, bit 1 and bit 0 are all high; and so on.

Synchronous counters can also be implemented with hardware [[finite-state machine]]s, which are more complex but allow for smoother, more stable transitions.

=== Decade counter ===
[[File:DecadeCounter.jpg|thumb|A circuit decade counter using JK Flip-flops (74LS112D)]]
A decade counter is one that counts in decimal digits, rather than binary.  A decade counter may have each (that is, it may count in [[binary-coded decimal]], as the [[List of 7400 series integrated circuits|7490]] integrated circuit did) or other binary encodings. "A decade counter is a binary counter that is designed to count to 1010 (decimal 10). An ordinary four-stage counter can be easily modified to a decade counter by adding a NAND gate as in the schematic to the right. Notice that FF2 and FF4 provide the inputs to the NAND gate. The NAND gate outputs are connected to the CLR input of each of the FFs." 
A decade counter is one that counts in decimal digits, rather than binary. It counts from 0 to 9 and then resets to zero. The counter output can be set to zero by pulsing the reset line low. The count then increments on each clock pulse until it reaches 1001 (decimal 9). When it increments to 1010 (decimal 10) both inputs of the NAND gate go high. The result is that the NAND output goes low, and resets the counter to zero. D going low can be a CARRY OUT signal, indicating that there has been a count of ten.

=== Ring counter ===
{{main article|Ring counter}}
A ring counter is a circular shift register which is initiated such that only one of its flip-flops is the state one while others are in their zero states.

A ring counter is a [[shift register]] (a cascade connection of [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]]) with the output of the last one connected to the input of the first, that is, in a ring.  Typically, a pattern consisting of a single bit is circulated so the state repeats every n clock cycles if n flip-flops are used.

=== Johnson counter ===
{{main article|Johnson counter}}
A [[Johnson counter]] (or [[switch-tail ring counter]], [[twisted ring counter]], [[walking ring counter]], or [[Möbius counter]]) is a modified ring counter, where the output from the last stage is inverted and fed back as input to the first stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Digital Principles Foundation of Circuit Design and Application | first = Arun Kumar | last = Singh | publisher =  New Age Publishers | year = 2006 | isbn = 81-224-1759-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=13Wi37h2A-oC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=switchtail+ring+counter+johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Art of Electronics | first1 = Paul | last1 = Horowitz | first2 = Winfield | last2 = Hill | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | isbn = 0-521-37095-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA667&amp;dq=ring+counter+walking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Dictionary of Electronics | first = Rudolf F | last = Graf | publisher = Newnes | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7506-9866-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uah1PkxWeKYC&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=moebius+ring+counter+johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The register cycles through a sequence of bit-patterns, whose length is equal to twice the length of the shift register, continuing indefinitely. These counters find specialist applications, including those similar to the decade counter, digital-to-analog conversion, etc.  They can be implemented easily using D- or JK-type flip-flops.

== Computer science counters ==
{{main article|Register machine}}

In [[computability theory]], a '''counter''' is considered a type of memory. A counter stores a single [[natural number]] (initially [[0 (number)|zero]]) and can be arbitrarily long. A counter is usually considered in conjunction with a [[finite-state machine]] (FSM), which can perform the following operations on the counter:

* Check whether the counter is zero
* Increment the counter by one.
* Decrement the counter by one (if it's already zero, this leaves it unchanged).

The following machines are listed in order of power, with each one being strictly more powerful than the one below it:
# Deterministic or non-deterministic FSM plus two counters
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one [[stack (data structure)|stack]]
# Non-deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic FSM plus one counter
# Deterministic or non-deterministic FSM.

For the first and last, it doesn't matter whether the FSM is a [[deterministic finite automaton]] or a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]].  They have the same power.  The first two and the last one are levels of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

The first machine, an FSM plus two counters, is equivalent in power to a [[Turing machine]]. See the article on [[counter machine]]s for a proof.

A '''web counter''' or '''hit counter''' is a computer software program that indicates the number of visitors, or hits, a particular [[webpage]] has received. Once set up, these counters will be incremented by one every time the web page is accessed in a [[web browser]].

The number is usually displayed as an inline [[digital image]] or in [[plain text]] or on a physical counter such as a [[#Mechanical counters|mechanical counter]]. Images may be presented in a variety of [[font]]s, or styles; the classic example is the wheels of an [[odometer]].

''Web counter'' was popular in the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s, later replaced by more detailed and complete [[web traffic]] measures.

=== Computer based counters ===

Many automation systems use PC and laptops to monitor different parameters of machines and production data. Counters may count parameters such as the number of pieces produced, the production batch number, and measurements of the amounts of material used.

Long before electronics became common, mechanical devices were used to count events. These are known as [[tally counter]]s. They typically consist of a series of disks mounted on an axle, with the digits zero through nine marked on their edge. The right most disk moves one increment with each event. Each disk except the left-most has a protrusion that, after the completion of one revolution, moves the next disk to the left one increment. Such counters were used as [[odometer]]s for bicycles and cars and in [[tape recorder]]s, [[fuel dispenser]]s, in production machinery as well as in other machinery. One of the largest manufacturers was the [[Veeder-Root]] company, and their name was often used for this type of counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.veeder.com/page/vr_history | title = VR History | publisher = Veeder}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand held [[tally counter]]s are used mainly for stocktaking and for counting people attending events.

[[Electromechanical]] counters were used to accumulate totals in [[tabulating machine]]s that pioneered the data processing industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8444">{{distinguish|Cross product}}
In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[elementary arithmetic]] and [[elementary algebra]], given an equation between two [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]s or [[rational fraction|rational expressions]], one can '''cross-multiply''' to simplify the equation or determine the value of a variable.

The method is also known as the "cross your heart" method because a heart can be drawn to remember which things to multiply together and the lines resemble a heart outline.

Given an equation like:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b = \frac c d&lt;/math&gt;

(where {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''d''}} are not zero), one can cross-multiply to get:

:&lt;math&gt;ad = bc \qquad \mathrm{or} \qquad a = \frac {bc} d.&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Euclidean geometry]] the same calculation can be achieved by considering the [[ratio]]s as those of [[similar triangle]]s.

== Procedure ==
In practice, the method of ''cross-multiplying'' means that we multiply the numerator of each (or one) side by the denominator of the other side, effectively crossing the terms over.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b \nwarrow \frac c d \quad \frac a b \nearrow \frac c d.&lt;/math&gt;

The mathematical justification for the method is from the following longer mathematical procedure. If we start with the basic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b = \frac c d&lt;/math&gt;

we can multiply the terms on each side by the same number and the terms will remain equal.  Therefore, if we multiply the fraction on each side by the product of the denominators of both sides—{{math|''bd''}}—we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b \times bd = \frac c d \times bd.&lt;/math&gt;

We can reduce the fractions to lowest terms by noting that the two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; on the left-hand side cancel, as do the two occurrences of {{math|''d''}} on the right-hand side, leaving:

:&lt;math&gt;ad = bc&lt;/math&gt;

and we can divide both sides of the equation by any of the elements—in this case we will use {{math|''d''}}—getting:

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac {bc} d.&lt;/math&gt;

Another justification of cross-multiplication is as follows. Starting with the given equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b = \frac c d&lt;/math&gt;

multiply by {{math|{{sfrac|''d''|''d''}}}} = 1 on the left and by {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''b''}}}} = 1 on the right, getting:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b \times \frac d d = \frac c d \times \frac b b&lt;/math&gt;

and so:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {ad} {bd} = \frac {cb} {db}.&lt;/math&gt;

Cancel the common denominator {{math|''bd''}} = {{math|''db''}}, leaving:

:&lt;math&gt;ad = cb.&lt;/math&gt;

Each step in these procedures is based on a single, fundamental property of [[equation]]s.  Cross-multiplication is a shortcut, an easily understandable procedure that can be taught to students.

== Use ==
This is a common procedure in mathematics, used to reduce fractions or calculate a value for a given variable in a fraction. If we have an equation like this, where {{math|''x''}} is a variable we are interested in solving for:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac x b = \frac c d&lt;/math&gt;

we can use cross multiplication to determine that:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac {bc} d.&lt;/math&gt;

For example, let's say that we want to know how far a car will get in 7 hours, if we happen to know that its speed is constant and that it already travelled 90 miles in the last 3 hours. Converting the word problem into ratios we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac x {7\ \mathrm{hours}} = \frac {90\ \mathrm{miles}} {3\ \mathrm{hours}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Cross-multiplying yields:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac {7\ \mathrm{hours} \times 90\ \mathrm{miles}} {3\ \mathrm{hours}}&lt;/math&gt;

and so:

:&lt;math&gt;x = 210\ \mathrm{miles}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that even simple equations like this:

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac {x} {d}&lt;/math&gt;

are solved using cross multiplication, since the missing {{math|''b''}} term is implicitly equal to 1:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a 1 = \frac x d.&lt;/math&gt;

Any equation containing fractions or rational expressions can be simplified by multiplying both sides by the [[least common denominator]].  This step is called ''[[clearing fractions]]''.

== Rule of Three ==

The '''Rule of Three'''&lt;ref&gt;This was sometimes also referred to as the Golden Rule, though that usage is rare compared to other uses of [[Golden Rule]]. See {{cite book|author=E. Cobham Brewer|authorlink=E. Cobham Brewer|title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|location=Philadelphia|publisher=Henry Altemus|year=1898|chapter=Golden Rule|chapter-url=http://www.bartleby.com/81/7351.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a shorthand version for a particular form of cross-multiplication, that may be taught to students by rote. It was considered the height of [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial]] math education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education |chapter=Mathematics Education in America in the Premodern Period |author=Ubiratan D'Ambrósio |author2=Joseph W. Dauben |author3=Karen Hunger Parshall |editor=Alexander Karp |editor2=Gert Schubring |page=177 |publisher=Springer Science |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4614-9155-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and still figures in the French national curriculum for secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eduscol.education.fr/cid47414/pilier-3.html |title=Socle de connaissances, pilier 3 |publisher=French ministry of education |date=30 December 2012  |access-date=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an equation of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac a b = \frac c x&lt;/math&gt;

where the variable to be evaluated is in the right-hand denominator, the Rule of Three states that:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac {bc} a.&lt;/math&gt;

In this context, {{math|''a''}} is referred to as the ''extreme'' of the proportion, and {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}} are called the ''means''.

This rule was already known to Chinese mathematicians prior to the 7th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Shen Kangshen|author2=John N. Crossley|author3=Anthony W.-C. Lun|title=The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art: Companion and Commentary|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was not used in Europe until much later. 

The Rule of Three gained notoriety{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} for being particularly difficult to explain. [[Cocker's Arithmetick]], the premier textbook in the 17th century, introduces its discussion of the Rule of Three&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Cocker|title=Cocker's Arithmetick|date=1702|location=London|publisher=John Hawkins|page=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GWcFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA103}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the problem, "If 4 Yards of Cloth cost 12 Shillings, what will 6 Yards cost at that Rate?" The Rule of Three gives the answer to this problem directly; whereas in modern arithmetic, we would solve it by introducing a variable {{math|''x''}} to stand for the cost of 6 yards of cloth, writing down the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {4\ \mathrm{yards}} {12\ \mathrm{shillings}} = \frac {6\ \mathrm{yards}} { x}&lt;/math&gt;

and then using cross-multiplication to calculate {{math|''x''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac {12\ \mathrm{shillings} \times 6\ \mathrm{yards}} {4\ \mathrm{yards}} = 18\ \mathrm{shillings}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3563">In [[combinatorics]], the '''Dinitz theorem''' (formerly known as '''Dinitz conjecture''') is a statement about the extension of arrays to partial [[Latin squares]], proposed in 1979 by [[Jeff Dinitz]],{{r|ert}} and proved in 1994 by [[Fred Galvin]].{{r|g|z}}

The Dinitz theorem is that given an ''n'' &amp;times; ''n'' square array, a set of ''m'' symbols with ''m'' ≥ ''n'', and for each cell of the array an ''n''-element set drawn from the pool of ''m'' symbols, it is possible to choose a way of labeling each cell with one of those elements in such a way that no row or column repeats a symbol.
It can also be formulated as a result in [[graph theory]], that the [[list chromatic index]] of the [[complete bipartite graph]] &lt;math&gt;K_{n, n}&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. That is, if each edge of the complete bipartite graph is assigned a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; colors, it is possible to choose one of the assigned colors for each edge
such that no two edges incident to the same vertex have the same color.

Galvin's proof generalizes to the statement that, for every bipartite [[multigraph]], the list chromatic index equals its [[chromatic index]]. The more general '''edge list coloring conjecture''' states that the same holds not only for bipartite graphs, but also for any loopless multigraph. An even more general conjecture states that the [[list coloring|list chromatic number]] of [[claw-free graph]]s always equals their [[chromatic number]].{{r|gm}} The Dinitz theorem is also related to [[Rota's basis conjecture]].{{r|c}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10413">The '''Dubins–Spanier theorems''' are several theorems in the theory of [[fair cake-cutting]]. They were published by [[Lester Dubins]] and [[Edwin Spanier]] in 1961.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2311357| jstor = 2311357| title = How to Cut a Cake Fairly| journal = The American Mathematical Monthly| volume = 68| pages = 1| year = 1961| last1 = [[Lester Dubins|Dubins]] | first1 = Lester Eli| last2 = [[Edwin Spanier|Spanier]] | first2 = Edwin Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original motivation for these theorems is fair division, they are in fact general theorems in [[measure theory]].

== Setting ==
There is a set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, and a set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; which is a [[sigma-algebra]] of subsets of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

There are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; partners. Every partner &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has a personal value measure &lt;math&gt;V_i: \mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. This function determines how much each subset of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is worth to that partner.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a partition of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; measurable sets: &lt;math&gt;U = X_1 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup X_k&lt;/math&gt;. Define the matrix &lt;math&gt;M_X&lt;/math&gt; as the following &lt;math&gt;n\times k&lt;/math&gt; matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;M_X[i,j] = V_i(X_j)&lt;/math&gt;

This matrix contains the valuations of all players to all pieces of the partition.

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M}&lt;/math&gt; be the collection of all such matrices (for the same value measures, the same &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, and different partitions):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M} = \{M_X \mid X\text{ is a }k\text{-partition of U}\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Dubins–Spanier theorems deal with the topological properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Statements ==
If all value measures &lt;math&gt;V_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[countably-additive]] and [[nonatomic measure|nonatomic]], then:

* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact set]];
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{M}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[convex set]].

This was already proved by Dvoretzky, Wald, and Wolfowitz. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2140/pjm.1951.1.59|title=Relations among certain ranges of vector measures|journal=Pacific Journal of Mathematics|volume=1|pages=59|year=1951|last1=Dvoretzky|first1=A.|last2=Wald|first2=A.|last3=Wolfowitz|first3=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Corollaries ==

=== Consensus partition ===
A cake partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to ''k'' pieces is called a ''consensus partition with weights &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_k&lt;/math&gt;'' (also called [[exact division]]) if:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \{1,\dots, n\}: \forall j \in \{1,\dots, k\}: V_i(X_j) = w_j&lt;/math&gt;
I.e, there is a consensus among all partners that the value of piece ''j'' is exactly &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose, from now on, that &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_k&lt;/math&gt; are weights whose sum is 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^k w_j =1&lt;/math&gt;
and the value measures are normalized such that each partner values the entire cake as exactly 1:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in \{1,\dots, n\}: V_i(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

The '''convexity''' part of the DS theorem implies that:&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|5}} 
:::If all value measures are countably-additive and nonatomic, 
:::then a consensus partition exists.

PROOF: For every &lt;math&gt;j \in \{1,\dots, k\}&lt;/math&gt;, define a partition &lt;math&gt;X^j&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;X^j_j = U&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall r\neq j: X^j_r = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;
In the partition &lt;math&gt;X^j&lt;/math&gt;, all partners value the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th piece as 1 and all other pieces as 0. Hence, in the matrix &lt;math&gt;M_{X^j}&lt;/math&gt;, there are ones on the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th column and zeros everywhere else.

By convexity, there is a partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt;M_X = \sum_{j=1}^k w_j\cdot M_{X^j}&lt;/math&gt;

In that matrix, the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th column contains only the value &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt;. This means that, in the partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, all partners value the &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;-th piece as exactly &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Note: this corollary confirms a previous assertion by [[Hugo Steinhaus]]. It also gives an affirmative answer to the [[problem of the Nile]] provided that there are only a finite number of flood heights.

=== Super-proportional division ===
A cake partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to ''n'' pieces (one piece per partner) is called a ''[[super-proportional division]] with weights &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, ..., w_n&lt;/math&gt;'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall i \in 1\dots n: V_i(X_i) &gt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;
I.e, the piece allotted to partner &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is strictly more valuable for him than what he deserves. The following statement is Dubins-Spanier Theorem on the existence of super-proportional division {{rp|6}}

{{math_theorem
|With these notations, let &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, ..., w_n&lt;/math&gt; be weights whose sum is 1, assume that the point &lt;math&gt;w:=(w_1, w_2, ..., w_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an interior point of the (n-1)-dimensional simplex with coordinates pairwise different, and assume that the value measures &lt;math&gt; V_1, ..., V_n&lt;/math&gt; are normalized such that each partner values the entire cake as exactly 1 (i.e. they are non-atomic probability measures). If at least two of the measures &lt;math&gt; V_i, V_j &lt;/math&gt; are not equal ( &lt;math&gt; V_i\neq V_j &lt;/math&gt;), then super-proportional divisions exist.}}

The hypothesis that the value measures &lt;math&gt; V_1, ..., V_n&lt;/math&gt; are not identical is necessary. Otherwise, the sum &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^n V_i(X_i) =\sum_{i=1}^n V_1(X_i) &gt; \sum_{i=1}^n w_i =1&lt;/math&gt; leads to a contradiction.

Namely, if all value measures are countably-additive and non-atomic,  and if there are two partners &lt;math&gt;i,j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;V_i\neq V_j&lt;/math&gt;,
then a super-proportional division exists.I.e, the necessary condition is also sufficient.

== Sketch of Proof ==

Suppose w.l.o.g. that &lt;math&gt;V_1 \neq V_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is some piece of the cake, &lt;math&gt;Z\subseteq U&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;V_1(Z)&gt;V_2(Z)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;\overline{Z}&lt;/math&gt; be the complement of &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;; then &lt;math&gt;V_2(\overline{Z})&gt;V_1(\overline{Z})&lt;/math&gt;. This means that &lt;math&gt;V_1(Z) + V_2(\overline{Z}) &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.  However, &lt;math&gt;w_1+w_2\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, either &lt;math&gt;V_1(Z)&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_2(\overline{Z})&gt;w_2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose w.l.o.g. that &lt;math&gt;V_1(Z)&gt;V_2(Z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_1(Z)&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt; are true.

Define the following partitions:
* &lt;math&gt;X^1&lt;/math&gt;: the partition that gives &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; to partner 1, &lt;math&gt;\overline{Z}&lt;/math&gt; to partner 2, and nothing to all others.
* &lt;math&gt;X^i&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;i\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;): the partition that gives the entire cake to partner &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and nothing to all others.

Here, we are interested only in the diagonals of the matrices &lt;math&gt;M_{X^j}&lt;/math&gt;, which represent the valuations of the partners to their own pieces:
* In &lt;math&gt;\textrm{diag}(M_{X^1})&lt;/math&gt;, entry 1 is &lt;math&gt;V_1(Z)&lt;/math&gt;, entry 2 is &lt;math&gt;V_2(\overline{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, and the other entries are 0.
* In &lt;math&gt;\textrm{diag}(M_{X^i})&lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt;i\geq 2&lt;/math&gt;), entry &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is 1 and the other entires are 0.

By convexity, for every set of weights &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2, ..., z_n&lt;/math&gt; there is a partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that:
:&lt;math&gt;M_X = \sum_{j=1}^n {z_j\cdot M_{X^j}}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to select the weights &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; such that, in the diagonal of &lt;math&gt;M_X&lt;/math&gt;, the entries are in the same ratios as the weights &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since we assumed that &lt;math&gt;V_1(Z)&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt;, it is possible to prove that &lt;math&gt;\forall i \in 1\dots n: V_i(X_i) &gt; w_i&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a super-proportional division.

=== Utilitarian-optimal division ===
A cake partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to ''n'' pieces (one piece per partner) is called ''[[utilitarian]]-optimal'' if it maximizes the sum of values. I.e, it maximizes:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n{V_i(X_i)}&lt;/math&gt;

Utilitarian-optimal divisions do not always exist. For example, suppose &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is the set of positive integers. There are two partners. Both value the entire set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as 1. Partner 1 assigns a positive value to every integer and partner 2 assigns zero value to every finite subset. From a utilitarian point of view, it is best to give partner 1 a large finite subset and give the remainder to partner 2. When the set given to partner 1 becomes larger and larger, the sum-of-values becomes closer and closer to 2, but it never approaches 2. So there is no utilitarian-optimal division.

The problem with the above example is that the value measure of partner 2 is finitely-additive but not [[countably-additive]].

The '''compactness''' part of the DS theorem immediately implies that:&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|7}}
:::If all value measures are countably-additive and nonatomic, 
:::then a utilitarian-optimal division exists.

In this special case, non-atomicity is not required: if all value measures are countably-additive, then a utilitarian-optimal partition exists.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|7}}

=== Leximin-optimal division ===
A cake partition &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to ''n'' pieces (one piece per partner) is called ''[[leximin]]-optimal with weights &lt;math&gt;w_1, w_2, ..., w_n&lt;/math&gt;'' if it maximizes the lexicographically-ordered vector of relative values. I.e, it maximizes the following vector:
:&lt;math&gt;{V_1(X_1) \over w_1}, {V_2(X_2) \over w_2}, \dots , {V_n(X_n) \over w_n}&lt;/math&gt;
where the partners are indexed such that:
:&lt;math&gt;{V_1(X_1) \over w_1} \leq {V_2(X_2) \over w_2} \leq \dots \leq {V_n(X_n) \over w_n}&lt;/math&gt;
A leximin-optimal partition maximizes the value of the poorest partner (relative to his weight); subject to that, it maximizes the value of the next-poorest partner (relative to his weight); etc.

The '''compactness''' part of the DS theorem immediately implies that:&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|8}}
:::If all value measures are countably-additive and nonatomic, 
:::then a leximin-optimal division exists.

== Further developments ==
* The leximin-optimality criterion, introduced by Dubins and Spanier, has been studied extensively later. In particular, in the problem of cake-cutting, it was studied by Marco Dall'Aglio.&lt;ref name=dallaglio01&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0377-0427(99)00393-3|title=The Dubins–Spanier optimization problem in fair division theory|journal=Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics|volume=130|pages=17|year=2001|last1=Dall'Aglio|first1=Marco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''finite topological space''' is a [[topological space]] for which the underlying [[set (mathematics)|point set]] is [[finite set|finite]]. That is, it is a topological space for which there are only finitely many points.

While topology has mainly been developed for infinite spaces, finite topological spaces are often used to provide examples of interesting phenomena or [[counterexample]]s to plausible sounding conjectures. [[William Thurston]] has called the study of finite topologies in this sense "an oddball topic that can
lend good insight to a variety of questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Thurston  | first = William P. | authorlink = William Thurston |date=April 1994  | title = On Proof and Progress in Mathematics | journal = [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]  | volume = 30  | issue = 2  | pages = 161–177  | arxiv = math/9404236 | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-1994-00502-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topologies on a finite set==

===As a bounded sublattice===

A [[topology (structure)|topology]] on a set ''X'' is defined as a subset of ''P''(''X''), the [[power set]] of ''X'', which includes both ∅ and ''X'' and is closed under finite [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]s and arbitrary [[union (set theory)|union]]s.

Since the power set of a finite set is finite there can be only finitely many [[open set]]s (and only finitely many [[closed set]]s). Therefore, one only need check that the union of a finite number of open sets is open. This leads to a simpler description of topologies on a finite set.

Let ''X'' be a finite set. A topology on ''X'' is a subset τ of ''P''(''X'') such that
#∅ ∈ τ and ''X'' ∈ τ
#if ''U'' and ''V'' are in τ then ''U'' ∪ ''V'' ∈ τ
#if ''U'' and ''V'' are in τ then ''U'' ∩ ''V'' ∈ τ

A topology on a finite set is therefore nothing more than a [[sublattice]] of (''P''(''X''), ⊂) which includes both the bottom element (∅) and the top element (''X'').

Every finite [[bounded lattice]] is [[complete lattice|complete]] since the [[meet and join|meet or join]] of any family of elements can always be reduced to a meet or join of two elements. It follows that in a finite topological space the union or intersection of an arbitrary family of open sets (resp. closed sets) is open (resp. closed).

===Specialization preorder===

Topologies on a finite set ''X'' are in [[one-to-one correspondence]] with [[preorder]]s on ''X''. Recall that a preorder on ''X'' is a [[binary relation]] on ''X'' which is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]].

Given a (not necessarily finite) topological space ''X'' we can define a preorder on ''X'' by
:''x'' &amp;le; ''y'' if and only if ''x'' &amp;isin; cl{''y''}
where cl{''y''} denotes the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the [[singleton set]] {''y''}. This preorder is called the ''[[specialization preorder]]'' on ''X''. Every open set ''U'' of ''X'' will be an [[upper set]] with respect to ≤ (i.e. if ''x'' ∈ ''U'' and ''x'' ≤ ''y'' then ''y'' ∈ ''U''). Now if ''X'' is finite, the converse is also true: every upper set is open in ''X''. So for finite spaces, the topology on ''X'' is uniquely determined by ≤.

Going in the other direction, suppose (''X'', ≤) is a preordered set. Define a topology τ on ''X'' by taking the open sets to be the upper sets with respect to ≤. Then the relation ≤ will be the specialization preorder of (''X'', τ). The topology defined in this way is called the [[Alexandrov topology]] determined by ≤.

The equivalence between preorders and finite topologies can be interpreted as a version of [[Birkhoff's representation theorem]], an equivalence between finite distributive lattices (the lattice of open sets of the topology) and partial orders (the partial order of equivalence classes of the preorder). This correspondence also works for a larger class of spaces called [[finitely generated space]]s. Finitely generated spaces can be characterized as the spaces in which an arbitrary intersection of open sets is open. Finite topological spaces are a special class of finitely generated spaces.

==Examples==

===0 or 1 points===

There is a unique topology on the [[empty set]] ∅. The only open set is the empty one. Indeed, this is the only subset of ∅.

Likewise, there is a unique topology on a [[singleton set]] {''a''}. Here the open sets are ∅ and {''a''}. This topology is both [[discrete space|discrete]] and [[trivial topology|trivial]], although in some ways it is better to think of it as a discrete space since it shares more properties with the family of finite discrete spaces.

For any topological space ''X'' there is a unique [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] from ∅ to ''X'', namely the [[empty function]]. There is also a unique continuous function from ''X'' to the singleton space {''a''}, namely the [[constant function]] to ''a''. In the language of [[category theory]] the empty space serves as an [[initial object]] in the [[category of topological spaces]] while the singleton space serves as a [[terminal object]].

===2 points===

Let ''X'' = {''a'',''b''} be a set with 2 elements. There are four distinct topologies on ''X'':
#{∅, {''a'',''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (the [[trivial topology]])
#{∅, {''a''}, {''a'',''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''b''}, {''a'',''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''a''}, {''b''}, {''a'',''b''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (the [[discrete topology]])

The second and third topologies above are easily seen to be [[homeomorphic]]. The function from ''X'' to itself which swaps ''a'' and ''b'' is a homeomorphism. A topological space homeomorphic to one of these is called a [[Sierpiński space]]. So, in fact, there are only three inequivalent topologies on a two-point set: the trivial one, the discrete one, and the Sierpiński topology.

The specialization preorder on the Sierpiński space {''a'',''b''} with {''b''} open is given by: ''a'' ≤ ''a'', ''b'' ≤ ''b'', and ''a'' ≤ ''b''.

===3 points===

Let ''X'' = {''a'',''b'',''c''} be a set with 3 elements. There are 29 distinct topologies on ''X'' but only 9 inequivalent topologies:
#{∅, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''c''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''a'',''b''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''c''}, {''a'',''b''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''c''}, {''b'',''c''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''c''}, {''a'',''c''}, {''b'',''c''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''a''}, {''b''}, {''a'',''b''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''b''}, {''c''}, {''a'',''b''}, {''b'',''c''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''a''}, {''b''}, {''c''}, {''a'',''b''}, {''a'',''c''}, {''b'',''c''}, {''a'',''b'',''c''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The last 5 of these are all [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The first one is trivial, while in 2, 3, and 4 the points ''a'' and ''b'' are [[topologically indistinguishable]].

===4 points===

Let ''X'' = {''a'',''b'',''c'',''d''} be a set with 4 elements. There are 355 distinct topologies on ''X'' but only 33 inequivalent topologies:

#{∅, {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
#{∅, {''a'', ''b'', ''c''}, {''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The last 16 of these are all [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].

==Properties==

===Compactness and countability===

Every finite topological space is [[compact space|compact]] since any [[open cover]] must already be finite. Indeed, compact spaces are often thought of as a generalization of finite spaces since they share many of the same properties.

Every finite topological space is also [[second-countable]] (there are only finitely many open sets) and [[separable space|separable]] (since the space itself is [[countable set|countable]]).

===Separation axioms===

If a finite topological space is [[T1 space|T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] (in particular, if it is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]]) then it must, in fact, be discrete. This is because the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of a point is a finite union of closed points and therefore closed. It follows that each point must be open.

Therefore, any finite topological space which is not discrete cannot be T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Hausdorff, or anything stronger.

However, it is possible for a non-discrete finite space to be [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In general, two points ''x'' and ''y'' are [[topologically indistinguishable]] if and only if ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''x'', where ≤ is the specialization preorder on ''X''. It follows that a space ''X'' is T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if the specialization preorder ≤ on ''X'' is a [[partial order]]. There are numerous partial orders on a finite set. Each defines a unique T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; topology.

Similarly, a space is [[R0 space|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] if and only if the specialization preorder is an equivalence relation. Given any equivalence relation on a finite set ''X'' the associated topology is the [[partition topology]] on ''X''. The equivalence classes will be the classes of topologically indistinguishable points. Since the partition topology is [[pseudometrizable space|pseudometrizable]], a finite space is R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if it is [[completely regular]].

Non-discrete finite spaces can also be [[normal space|normal]]. The [[excluded point topology]] on any finite set is a [[completely normal space|completely normal]] T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; space which is non-discrete.

===Connectivity===

Connectivity in a finite space ''X'' is best understood by considering the specialization preorder ≤ on ''X''. We can associate to any preordered set ''X'' a [[directed graph]] Γ by taking the points of ''X'' as vertices and drawing an edge ''x'' → ''y'' whenever ''x'' ≤ ''y''. The connectivity of a finite space ''X'' can be understood by considering the [[connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] of the associated graph Γ.

In any topological space, if ''x'' ≤ ''y'' then there is a [[path (topology)|path]] from ''x'' to ''y''. One can simply take ''f''(0) = ''x'' and ''f''(''t'') = ''y'' for ''t'' &amp;gt; 0. It is easily to verify that ''f'' is continuous. It follows that the [[path component]]s of a finite topological space are precisely the (weakly) [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s of the associated graph Γ. That is, there is a topological path from ''x'' to ''y'' if and only if there is an [[path (graph theory)|undirected path]] between the corresponding vertices of Γ.

Every finite space is [[locally path-connected]] since the set
:&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\uarr}x = \{y \in X : x \leq y\}&lt;/math&gt;
is a path-connected open [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] of ''x'' that is contained in every other neighborhood. In other words, this single set forms a [[local base]] at ''x''.

Therefore, a finite space is [[connected space|connected]] if and only if it is path-connected. The connected components are precisely the path components. Each such component is both [[clopen set|closed and open]] in ''X''.

Finite spaces may have stronger connectivity properties. A finite space ''X'' is
*[[hyperconnected space|hyperconnected]] if and only if there is a [[greatest element]] with respect to the specialization preorder. This is an element whose closure is the whole space ''X''.
*[[Ultraconnected space|ultraconnected]] if and only if there is a [[least element]] with respect to the specialization preorder. This is an element whose only neighborhood is the whole space ''X''.
For example, the [[particular point topology]] on a finite space is hyperconnected while the [[excluded point topology]] is ultraconnected. The [[Sierpiński space]] is both.

===Additional structure===

A finite topological space is [[pseudometrizable space|pseudometrizable]] if and only if it is [[R0 space|R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]. In this case, one possible [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \begin{cases}0 &amp; x\equiv y \\ 1 &amp; x\not\equiv y\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' ≡ ''y'' means ''x'' and ''y'' are [[topologically indistinguishable]]. A finite topological space is [[metrizable space|metrizable]] if and only if it is discrete.

Likewise, a topological space is [[uniformizable space|uniformizable]] if and only if it is R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[uniform structure]] will be the pseudometric uniformity induced by the above pseudometric.

===Algebraic topology===

Perhaps surprisingly, there are finite topological spaces with nontrivial [[fundamental group]]s. A simple example is the [[pseudocircle]], which is space ''X'' with four points, two of which are open and two of which are closed. There is a continuous map from the [[unit circle]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; to ''X'' which is a [[weak homotopy equivalence]] (i.e. it induces an [[isomorphism]] of [[homotopy group]]s). It follows that the fundamental group of the pseudocircle is [[infinite cyclic group|infinite cyclic]].

More generally it has been shown that for any finite [[abstract simplicial complex]] ''K'', there is a finite topological space ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; and a weak homotopy equivalence ''f'' : |''K''| → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; where |''K''| is the [[geometric realization]] of ''K''. It follows that the homotopy groups of |''K''| and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; are isomorphic.  In fact, the underlying set of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; can be taken to be ''K'' itself, with the topology associated to the inclusion partial order.

==Number of topologies on a finite set==

As discussed above, topologies on a finite set are in one-to-one correspondence with [[preorder]]s on the set, and [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; topologies]] are in one-to-one correspondence with [[partial order]]s. Therefore, the number of topologies on a finite set is equal to the number of preorders and the number of T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; topologies is equal to the number of partial orders.

The table below lists the number of distinct (T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) topologies on a set with ''n'' elements. It also lists the number of inequivalent (i.e. [[homeomorphic|nonhomeomorphic]]) topologies.

Let ''T''(''n'') denote the number of distinct topologies on a set with ''n'' points. There is no known simple formula to compute ''T''(''n'') for arbitrary ''n''. The [[Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] presently lists ''T''(''n'') for ''n'' ≤ 18.

The number of distinct T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; topologies on a set with ''n'' points, denoted ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), is related to ''T''(''n'') by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;T(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{n}S(n,k)\,T_0(k)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S''(''n'',''k'') denotes the [[Stirling number of the second kind]].

{{General relativity sidebar |equations}}

In [[general relativity]], a '''geodesic''' generalizes the notion of a "straight line" to curved [[spacetime]]. Importantly, the [[world line]] of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force, is a particular type of geodesic. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.

In general relativity, gravity can be regarded as not a force but a consequence of a [[Spacetime curvature|curved spacetime]] geometry where the source of curvature is the [[stress–energy tensor]] (representing matter, for instance).  Thus, for example, the path of a planet orbiting a star is the projection of a geodesic of the curved 4-D spacetime geometry around the star onto 3-D space.

==Mathematical expression==
The full '''geodesic equation''' is this:
:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\mu \over ds^2}+\Gamma^\mu {}_{\alpha \beta}{d x^\alpha \over ds}{d x^\beta \over ds}=0\ .&lt;/math&gt;
where ''s'' is a scalar parameter of motion (e.g. the [[proper time]]), and &lt;math&gt; \Gamma^\mu {}_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Christoffel symbols]] (sometimes called the [[affine connection]] coefficients or [[Levi-Civita connection]] coefficients) which is symmetric in the two lower indices.  Greek indices may take the values: 0, 1, 2, 3 and the [[summation convention]] is used for repeated indices &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  The quantity on the left-hand-side of this equation is the acceleration of a particle, and so this equation is analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion]] which likewise provide formulae for the acceleration of a particle.  This equation of motion employs the [[Einstein notation]], meaning that repeated indices are summed (i.e. from zero to three).  The Christoffel symbols are functions of the four space-time coordinates, and so are independent of the velocity or acceleration or other characteristics of a [[test particle]] whose motion is described by the geodesic equation.

==Equivalent mathematical expression using coordinate time as parameter==
So far the geodesic equation of motion has been written in terms of a scalar parameter ''s''. It can alternatively be written in terms of the time coordinate, &lt;math&gt;t \equiv x^0&lt;/math&gt; (here we have used the [[triple bar]] to signify a definition). The geodesic equation of motion then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\mu \over dt^2} =- \Gamma^\mu {}_{\alpha \beta}{d x^\alpha \over dt}{d x^\beta \over dt}+ \Gamma^0 {}_{\alpha \beta}{d x^\alpha \over dt}{d x^\beta \over dt}{d x^\mu \over dt}\ .&lt;/math&gt;

This formulation of the geodesic equation of motion can be useful for computer calculations and to compare General Relativity with Newtonian Gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Will, Clifford.  ''Theory and Experiment in Gravitational Physics'', p. 143 (Cambridge University Press 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  It is straightforward to derive this form of the geodesic equation of motion from the form which uses proper time as a parameter, using the [[chain rule]].  Notice that both sides of this last equation vanish when the mu index is set to zero.  If the particle's velocity is small enough, then the geodesic equation reduces to this:

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^n \over dt^2} =- \Gamma^n {}_{00}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the Latin index ''n'' takes the values [1,2,3].  This equation simply means that all test particles at a particular place and time will have the same acceleration, which is a well-known feature of Newtonian gravity.  For example, everything floating around in the [[international space station]] will undergo roughly the same acceleration due to gravity.

==Derivation directly from the equivalence principle==
Physicist [[Steven Weinberg]] has presented a derivation of the geodesic equation of motion directly from the [[equivalence principle]].&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;Weinberg, Steven.  ''Gravitation and Cosmology: Principles and Applications of the General Theory of Relativity'' (Wiley 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;
The first step in such a derivation is to suppose that no particles are accelerating in the neighborhood of a [[point-event]] with respect to a freely falling coordinate system (&lt;math&gt;X^\mu&lt;/math&gt;).  Setting &lt;math&gt;T \equiv X^0&lt;/math&gt;, we have the following equation that is locally applicable in free fall:
:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 X^\mu \over dT^2} = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;
The next step is to employ the multi-dimensional [[chain rule]].  We have:

:&lt;math&gt; {d X^\mu \over dT}={d x^\nu \over dT} {\partial X^\mu \over \partial x^\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

Differentiating once more with respect to the time, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 X^\mu \over dT^2}={d^2 x^\nu \over dT^2} {\partial X^\mu \over \partial x^\nu} + {d x^\nu \over dT} {d x^\alpha \over dT} {\partial^2 X^\mu \over \partial x^\nu\partial x^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\nu \over dT^2} {\partial X^\mu \over \partial x^\nu} =- {d x^\nu \over dT} {d x^\alpha \over dT} {\partial^2 X^\mu \over \partial x^\nu\partial x^\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Multiply both sides of this last equation by the following quantity:

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial x^\lambda \over \partial X^\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, we have this:

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\lambda \over dT^2} = - {d x^\nu \over dT} {d x^\alpha \over dT} \left[{\partial^2 X^\mu \over \partial x^\nu\partial x^\alpha} {\partial x^\lambda \over \partial X^\mu}\right] .&lt;/math&gt;

Using (from [[Christoffel symbols#Change of variable]] and the fact that the Christoffel symbols vanish in an inertial frame of reference)
:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\nu \alpha} = \left[{\partial^2 X^\mu \over \partial x^\nu\partial x^\alpha} {\partial x^\lambda \over \partial X^\mu}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

it becomes
:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\lambda \over dT^2} = - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu \alpha} {d x^\nu \over dT} {d x^\alpha \over dT} .&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the one-dimensional [[chain rule]] gives
:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\lambda \over d t^2} \left( \frac{d t}{d T} \right)^2 + {d x^\lambda \over d t} \frac{d^2 t}{d T^2} = - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu \alpha} {d x^\nu \over d t} {d x^\alpha \over d t} \left( \frac{d t}{d T} \right)^2 .&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\lambda \over d t^2} + {d x^\lambda \over d t} \frac{d^2 t}{d T^2} \left( \frac{d T}{d t} \right)^2 = - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu \alpha} {d x^\nu \over d t} {d x^\alpha \over d t} .&lt;/math&gt;

As before, we can set &lt;math&gt;t \equiv x^0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the first derivative of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; with respect to ''t'' is one and the second derivative is zero. Replacing ''&amp;lambda;'' with zero gives:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d^2 t}{d T^2} \left( \frac{d T}{d t} \right)^2 = - \Gamma^{0}_{\nu \alpha} {d x^\nu \over d t} {d x^\alpha \over d t} .&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting d ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;lambda;''&lt;/sup&gt; / d ''t'' times this from the previous equation gives:
:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\lambda \over dt^2} = - \Gamma^{\lambda}_{\nu \alpha} {d x^\nu \over dt} {d x^\alpha \over dt} + \Gamma^{0}_{\nu \alpha} {d x^\nu \over dt} {d x^\alpha \over dt}{d x^\lambda \over dt} &lt;/math&gt;

which is a form of the geodesic equation of motion (using the coordinate time as parameter).

The geodesic equation of motion can alternatively be derived using the concept of [[parallel transport]].&lt;ref&gt;Plebański, Jerzy and Krasiński, Andrzej. ''An Introduction to General Relativity and Cosmology'', p. 34 (Cambridge University Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deriving the geodesic equation via an action==

We can (and this is the most common technique) derive the geodesic equation via the [[action (physics)|action]] principle. Consider the case of trying to find a geodesic between two timelike-separated events.

Let the action be 
:&lt;math&gt;S=\int ds&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;ds=\sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu}(x)dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[line element]]. There is a negative sign inside the square root because the curve must be timelike. To get the geodesic equation we must vary this action. To do this let us parameterize this action with respect to a parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. Doing this we get:
 
:&lt;math&gt;S=\int\sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}}d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

We can now go ahead and vary this action with respect to the curve &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;. By the [[principle of least action]] we get:

:&lt;math&gt;0=\delta S=\int\delta\left(\sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}}\right)d\lambda =\int\frac{\delta\left(-g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}\right)}{2\sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\lambda}}}d\lambda&lt;/math&gt;

Using the product rule we get:

:&lt;math&gt;0=\int\left(\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\delta g_{\mu\nu}+g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d\delta x^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}+g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{d\delta x^{\nu}}{d\lambda}\right)d\lambda = \int\left(\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}\delta x^{\alpha}+2g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d\delta x^{\mu}}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\right)d\lambda &lt;/math&gt;

Integrating by-parts the last term and dropping the total derivative (which equals to zero at the boundaries) we get that:

:&lt;math&gt;0=\int \left(\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}\delta x^{\alpha}-2\delta x^{\mu}\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\right)\right) d\tau = \int \left(\frac{dx^{\mu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}\delta x^{\alpha}-2\delta x^{\mu}\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}-2\delta x^{\mu}g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d^{2}x^{\nu}}{d\tau^{2}}\right) d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

Simplifying a bit we see that:

:&lt;math&gt;0=\int \left(-2g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d^{2}x^{\nu}}{d\tau^{2}}+\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\nu}-2\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}\right) \delta x^{\mu}d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

so,

:&lt;math&gt;0=\int \left(-2g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d^{2}x^{\nu}}{d\tau^{2}}+\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\nu}-\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}-\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\partial_{\nu}g_{\mu\alpha}\right) \delta x^{\mu}d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

multiplying this equation by &lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; we get:

:&lt;math&gt;0=\int \left(g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d^{2}x^{\nu}}{d\tau^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\left(\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}+\partial_{\nu}g_{\mu\alpha}-\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\nu}\right)\right) \delta x^{\mu}d\tau &lt;/math&gt;

So by [[Hamilton's principle]] we find that the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] is

:&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}\frac{d^{2}x^{\nu}}{d\tau^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}\left(\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}+\partial_{\nu}g_{\mu\alpha}-\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\nu}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by the inverse [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;g^{\mu\beta}&lt;/math&gt; we get that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^{2}x^{\beta}}{d\tau^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\beta}\left(\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}+\partial_{\nu}g_{\mu\alpha}-\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\nu}\right)\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}=0&lt;/math&gt;

Thus we get the geodesic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^{2}x^{\beta}}{d\tau^{2}}+\Gamma^{\beta}{}_{\alpha\nu}\frac{dx^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}=0&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[Christoffel symbol]] defined in terms of the metric tensor as

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{\beta}{}_{\alpha\nu}=\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\beta}\left(\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}+\partial_{\nu}g_{\mu\alpha}-\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\nu}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(NOTE: Similar derivations, with minor amendments, can be used to produce analogous results for geodesics between light-like{{cn|date=July 2018}} or space-like separated pairs of points.)

==Equation of motion may follow from the field equations for empty space==
[[Albert Einstein]] believed that the geodesic equation of motion can be derived from the [[Einstein Field Equations#Vacuum field equations|field equations for empty space]], i.e. from the fact that the [[Ricci curvature]] vanishes.  He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert.  ''The Meaning of Relativity'', p. 113 (Psychology Press 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been shown that this law of motion — generalized to the case of arbitrarily large gravitating masses — can be derived from the field equations of empty space alone.  According to this derivation the law of motion is implied by the condition that the field be singular nowhere outside its generating mass points.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|last2=Rosen|first2=N.|title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity|journal=Physical Review|date=1 July 1935|volume=48|issue=1|pages=76|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48...73E }} and ER - Einstein Rosen paper [[ER=EPR]] &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the imperfections of the original relativistic theory of gravitation was that as a field theory it was not complete; it introduced the independent postulate that the law of motion of a particle is given by the equation of the geodesic. 
A complete field theory knows only fields and not the concepts of particle and motion. For these must not exist independently from the field but are to be treated as part of it.
 On the basis of the description of a particle without singularity, one has the possibility of a logically more satisfactory treatment of the combined problem: The problem of the field and that of the motion coincide.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Both physicists and philosophers have often repeated the assertion that the geodesic equation can be obtained from the field equations to describe the motion of a [[gravitational singularity]], but this claim remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Tamir, M. "[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9158/1/Tamir_-_Proving_the_Principle.pdf Proving the principle: Taking geodesic dynamics too seriously in Einstein’s theory]", ''Studies In History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'' 43(2), 137–154 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;  Less controversial is the notion that the field equations determine the motion of a fluid or dust, as distinguished from the motion of a point-singularity.&lt;ref&gt;Plebański, Jerzy and Krasiński, Andrzej. ''An Introduction to General Relativity and Cosmology'', p. 143 (Cambridge University Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension to the case of a charged particle==
In deriving the geodesic equation from the equivalence principle, it was assumed that particles in a local inertial coordinate system are not accelerating.  However, in real life, the particles may be charged, and therefore may be accelerating locally in accordance with the [[Lorentz force]].  That is:
:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 X^\mu \over ds^2} = {q \over m} {F^{\mu \beta}} {d X^\alpha \over ds}{\eta_{\alpha \beta}}.&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt; {\eta_{\alpha \beta}}{d X^\alpha \over ds}{d X^\beta \over ds}=-1.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Minkowski space|Minkowski tensor]] &lt;math&gt;\eta_{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{\alpha \beta} = \begin{pmatrix}-1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These last three equations can be used as the starting point for the derivation of an equation of motion in General Relativity, instead of assuming that acceleration is zero in free fall.&lt;ref name=Weinberg /&gt;  Because the Minkowski tensor is involved here, it becomes necessary to introduce something called the ''[[metric tensor]]'' in General Relativity.  The metric tensor ''g'' is symmetric, and locally reduces to the Minkowski tensor in free fall.  The resulting equation of motion is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wald|first=R.M.|title=General Relativity|location=Eq. 4.3.2|isbn=978-0-226-87033-5|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {d^2 x^\mu \over ds^2} =- \Gamma^\mu {}_{\alpha \beta}{d x^\alpha \over ds}{d x^\beta \over ds}\ +{q \over m} {F^{\mu \beta}} {d x^\alpha \over ds}{g_{\alpha \beta}}.&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt; {g_{\alpha \beta}}{d x^\alpha \over ds}{d x^\beta \over ds}=-1.&lt;/math&gt;

This last equation signifies that the particle is moving along a timelike geodesic; massless particles like the [[photon]] instead follow null geodesics (replace −1 with zero on the right-hand side of the last equation).  It is important that the last two equations are consistent with each other, when the latter is differentiated with respect to proper time, and the following formula for the Christoffel symbols ensures that consistency:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\beta}=\frac{1}{2}g^{\lambda \tau} \left(\frac{\partial g_{\tau\alpha}}{\partial x^\beta} + \frac{\partial g_{\tau\beta}}{\partial x^{\alpha}} - \frac{\partial g_{\alpha\beta}}{\partial x^{\tau}} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

This last equation does not involve the electromagnetic fields, and it is applicable even in the limit as the electromagnetic fields vanish.  The letter ''g'' with superscripts refers to the [[Invertible matrix|inverse]] of the metric tensor.  In General Relativity, indices of tensors are lowered and raised by [[Tensor contraction|contraction]] with the metric tensor or its inverse, respectively.

==Geodesics as curves of stationary interval==
A geodesic between two events can also be described as the curve joining those two events which has a stationary [[Spacetime#Spacetime intervals|interval]] (4-dimensional "length"). ''Stationary'' here is used in the sense in which that term is used in the [[calculus of variations]], namely, that the interval along the curve varies minimally among curves that are nearby to the geodesic.

In Minkowski space there is only one time-like geodesic that connects any given pair of time-like separated events, and that geodesic is the curve with the longest [[proper time]] between the two events.  But in curved spacetime, it's possible for a pair of widely separated events to have more than one time-like geodesic that connects them.  In such instances, the proper times along the various geodesics will not in general be the same.  And for some geodesics in such instances, it's possible for a curve that connects the two events and is nearby to the geodesic to have either a longer or a shorter proper time than the geodesic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Charles W. Misner]] |author2=[[Kip Thorne]] |author3=[[John Archibald Wheeler]] | title = [[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]] | publisher = [[W. H. Freeman]] | year = 1973 | isbn = 0-7167-0344-0 | pages = 316, 318–319 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a space-like geodesic through two events, there are always nearby curves which go through the two events that have either a longer or a shorter [[proper length]] than the geodesic, even in Minkowski space.  In Minkowski space, in an inertial frame of reference in which the two events are simultaneous, the geodesic will be the straight line between the two events at the time at which the events occur.  Any curve that differs from the geodesic purely spatially (''i.e.'' does not change the time coordinate) in that frame of reference will have a longer proper length than the geodesic, but a curve that differs from the geodesic purely temporally (''i.e.'' does not change the space coordinate) in that frame of reference will have a shorter proper length.

The interval of a curve in spacetime is
:&lt;math&gt; l = \int \sqrt{\left|g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu \right|} \, ds\ .&lt;/math&gt;
Then, the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]],
:&lt;math&gt; {d \over ds} {\partial \over \partial \dot x^\alpha} \sqrt{\left| g_{\mu \nu} \dot 
x^\mu \dot x^\nu \right|} = {\partial \over \partial x^\alpha} \sqrt{\left| g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu \right|} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
becomes, after some calculation, 
:&lt;math&gt; 2(\Gamma^\lambda {}_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu + \ddot x^\lambda) = U^\lambda {d \over ds} \ln |U_\nu U^\nu| \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; U^\mu = \dot x^\mu .&lt;/math&gt;
{{hidden begin|title=Proof}}
The goal being to find a curve for which the value of
:&lt;math&gt; l = \int d\tau = \int {d\tau \over d\phi} \, d\phi = \int \sqrt{{(d\tau)^2 \over (d\phi)^2}} \, d\phi = \int \sqrt{{-g_{\mu \nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu \over d\phi \, d\phi}} \, d\phi = \int f \, d\phi&lt;/math&gt;
is stationary, where
: &lt;math&gt; f = \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu} &lt;/math&gt;
such goal can be accomplished by calculating the Euler–Lagrange equation for ''f'', which is 
: &lt;math&gt; {d \over d\tau} {\partial f \over \partial \dot x^\lambda} = {\partial f \over \partial x^\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting the expression of ''f'' into the Euler–Lagrange equation (which makes the value of the integral ''l'' stationary), gives
:&lt;math&gt; {d \over d\tau} {\partial \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu} \over \partial \dot x^\lambda} = {\partial \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu} \over \partial x^\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

Now calculate the derivatives:
&lt;math&gt; {d \over d\tau} \left( {-g_{\mu \nu} {\partial \dot x^\mu \over \partial \dot x^\lambda} \dot x^\nu - g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu {\partial \dot x^\nu \over \partial \dot x^\lambda} \over 2 \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}} \right) = {-g_{\mu \nu, \lambda} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu \over 2 \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}} \qquad \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {d \over d\tau} \left( {g_{\mu \nu} \delta^\mu {}_\lambda \dot x^\nu + g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \delta^\nu {}_\lambda \over 2 \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}} \right) = {g_{\mu \nu , \lambda} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu \over 2 \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}} \qquad \qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {d \over d\tau} \left( {g_{\lambda \nu} \dot x^\nu + g_{\mu \lambda} \dot x^\mu \over \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}} \right) = {g_{\mu \nu , \lambda} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu \over \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}} \qquad \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {\sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu} {d \over d\tau} (g_{\lambda \nu} \dot x^\nu + g_{\mu \lambda} \dot x^\mu) - (g_{\lambda \nu} \dot x^\nu + g_{\mu \lambda} \dot x^\mu) {d \over d\tau} \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu} \over -g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu} = {g_{\mu \nu , \lambda} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu \over \sqrt{-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu}} \qquad \qquad (4) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; {(-g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu) {d \over d\tau} (g_{\lambda \nu} \dot x^\nu + g_{\mu \lambda} \dot x^\mu) + {1 \over 2} (g_{\lambda \nu} \dot x^\nu + g_{\mu \lambda} \dot x^\mu) {d \over d\tau} (g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu) \over -g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu} = g_{\mu \nu ,\lambda} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu \qquad \qquad (5) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; (g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu) (g_{\lambda \nu ,\mu} \dot x^\nu \dot x^\mu + g_{\mu \lambda ,\nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu + g_{\lambda \nu} \ddot x^\nu + g_{\lambda \mu} \ddot x^\mu) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (g_{\mu \nu ,\lambda} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu) (g_{\alpha \beta} \dot x^\alpha \dot x^\beta) + {1 \over 2} (g_{\lambda \nu} \dot x^\nu + g_{\lambda \mu} \dot x^\mu) {d \over d\tau} (g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu) \qquad \qquad (6) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; g_{\lambda \nu ,\mu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu + g_{\lambda \mu ,\nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu - g_{\mu \nu ,\lambda} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu +  2 g_{\lambda \mu} \ddot x^\mu = {\dot x_\lambda {d \over d\tau} (g_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu) \over g_{\alpha \beta} \dot x^\alpha \dot x^\beta} \qquad \qquad (7) &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 2(\Gamma_{\lambda \mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu + \ddot x_\lambda) = {\dot x_\lambda {d \over d\tau} (\dot x_\nu \dot x^\nu) \over \dot x_\beta \dot x^\beta} = {U_\lambda {d \over d\tau} (U_\nu U^\nu) \over U_\beta U^\beta} = U_\lambda {d \over d\tau} \ln |U_\nu U^\nu| \qquad \qquad (8) &lt;/math&gt;

This is just one step away from the geodesic equation.
{{hidden end}}
If the parameter ''s'' is chosen to be affine, then the right side the above equation vanishes (because &lt;math&gt;U_\nu U^\nu&lt;/math&gt; is constant).  Finally, we have the geodesic equation
:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma^\lambda {}_{\mu \nu} \dot x^\mu \dot x^\nu + \ddot x^\lambda = 0\ .&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Illustration of great-circle distance.svg|thumb|A diagram illustrating great-circle distance (drawn in red) between two points on a sphere, P and Q. Two antipodal points, u and v, are also shown.]]

The '''great-circle distance''' or '''orthodromic distance''' is the shortest [[distance]] between two [[Point (geometry)|point]]s on the surface of a [[sphere]], measured along the surface of the sphere (as opposed to a straight line through the sphere's interior). The distance between two points in [[Euclidean space]] is the length of a straight line between them, but on the sphere there are no straight lines. In [[manifold|spaces with curvature]], straight lines are replaced by [[geodesic]]s. Geodesics on the sphere are circles on the sphere whose centers coincide with the center of the sphere, and are called ''[[great circle]]s''.

The determination of the great-circle distance is part of the more general problem of [[great-circle navigation]], which also computes the azimuths at the end points and intermediate way-points.

Through any two points on a sphere that are not [[antipodal point|directly opposite each other]], there is a unique great circle. The two points separate the great circle into two arcs. The length of the shorter arc is the great-circle distance between the points. A great circle endowed with such a distance is called a [[Riemannian circle]] in [[Riemannian geometry]].

Between two points that are directly opposite each other, called ''[[antipodal point]]s'', there are infinitely many great circles, and all great circle arcs between antipodal points have a length of half the [[circumference]] of the circle, or &lt;math&gt;\pi r&lt;/math&gt;, where ''r'' is the [[radius]] of the sphere.

The [[Earth]] is nearly spherical (see [[Earth radius]]), so great-circle distance formulas give the distance between points on the surface of the Earth correct to within about 0.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Admiralty Manual of Navigation, Volume 1|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=1987|isbn=9780117728806|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcy4K5BPyg4C&amp;pg=PA10|quotation=The errors introduced by assuming a spherical Earth based on the international nautical mile are not more than 0.5% for latitude, 0.2% for longitude.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See {{section link|Arc length|Arcs of great circles on the Earth}}.)

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi_1,\lambda_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2,\lambda_2&lt;/math&gt; be the geographical [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in radians of two points 1 and 2, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi,\Delta\lambda&lt;/math&gt; be their absolute differences; then &lt;math&gt;\Delta\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the [[central angle]] between them, is given by the [[spherical law of cosines]] if one of the poles is used as an auxiliary third point on the sphere:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kells |first1=Lyman M. |last2=Kern |first2=Willis F. |last3=Bland |first3=James R. |title=Plane And Spherical Trigonometry |url=https://archive.org/details/planeandspherica031803mbp |accessdate=July 13, 2018 |year=1940 |publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company, Inc. |location= |pages=323-326 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\sigma=\arccos\bigl(\sin\phi_1\cdot\sin\phi_2+\cos\phi_1\cdot\cos\phi_2\cdot\cos(\Delta\lambda)\bigr).&lt;/math&gt;

The problem is normally expressed in terms of finding the central angle &lt;math&gt;\Delta\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.  Given this angle in radians, the actual [[arc length]] ''d'' on a sphere of radius ''r'' can be trivially computed as
:&lt;math&gt;d = r \, \Delta\sigma.&lt;/math&gt;

===Computational formulas===
On computer systems with low [[floating point|floating-point precision]], the spherical law of cosines formula can have large [[rounding error]]s if the distance is small (if the two points are a kilometer apart on the surface of the Earth, the cosine of the central angle comes out 0.99999999). For modern [[IEEE 754|64-bit floating-point numbers]], the spherical law of cosines formula, given above, does not have serious rounding errors for distances larger than a few meters on the surface of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html | title=Calculate distance, bearing and more between Latitude/Longitude points | accessdate=10 Aug 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[haversine formula]] is [[Condition number|numerically better-conditioned]] for small distances:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinnott|first1=Roger W.|title=Virtues of the Haversine|journal=Sky and Telescope|date=August 1984|volume=68|issue=2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta\sigma &amp;= \operatorname{hav}^{-1} \left( \operatorname{hav}\left(\Delta\phi\right) + \cos\phi_1\cdot\cos\phi_2\cdot \operatorname{hav}\left(\Delta\lambda\right)\right)\\
&amp; = 2\arcsin \sqrt{\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right)+\cos{\phi_1}\cdot\cos{\phi_2}\cdot\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)} .\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Historically, the use of this formula was simplified by the availability of tables for the [[haversine]] function: hav(''θ'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''θ''/2).

Although this formula is accurate for most distances on a sphere, it too suffers from rounding errors for the special (and somewhat unusual) case of [[antipodal point]]s (on opposite ends of the sphere). A formula that is accurate for all distances is the following special case of the [[Vincenty's formulae|Vincenty formula]] for an ellipsoid with equal major and minor axes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\sigma=\arctan \frac{\sqrt{\left(\cos\phi_2\cdot\sin(\Delta\lambda)\right)^2+\left(\cos\phi_1\cdot\sin\phi_2-\sin\phi_1\cdot\cos\phi_2\cdot\cos(\Delta\lambda)\right)^2}}{\sin\phi_1\cdot\sin\phi_2+\cos\phi_1\cdot\cos\phi_2\cdot\cos(\Delta\lambda)} .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Vector version ===
Another representation of similar formulas, but using [[n-vector|normal vectors]] instead of latitude and longitude to describe the positions, is found by means of 3D [[vector_calculus#Vector_operations|vector algebra]], utilizing the [[dot product]], [[cross product]], or a combination:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gade |first1= Kenneth |year= 2010 |title= A non-singular horizontal position representation |journal= The Journal of Navigation |publisher= Cambridge University Press |volume= 63 |issue= 3 |pages=395–417 |url=http://www.navlab.net/Publications/A_Nonsingular_Horizontal_Position_Representation.pdf| format=PDF |doi= 10.1017/S0373463309990415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta\sigma &amp;=\arccos (\mathbf n_1\cdot \mathbf n_2) \\
\Delta\sigma &amp;=\arcsin \left| \mathbf n_1\times \mathbf n_2 \right| \\
\Delta\sigma &amp;=\arctan \frac{\left| \mathbf n_1\times \mathbf n_2 \right|}{\mathbf n_1\cdot \mathbf n_2} \\
\end{align}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf n_2&lt;/math&gt; are the normals to the ellipsoid at the two positions 1 and 2. Similarly to the equations above based on latitude and longitude, the expression based on arctan is the only one that is well-conditioned [[Inverse trigonometric functions#Numerical_accuracy|for all angles]]. The expression based on arctan requires the magnitude of the cross product over the dot product.

=== From chord length ===
A line through three-dimensional space between points of interest on a spherical Earth is the [[Chord_(geometry)|chord]] of the great circle between the points. The [[central angle]] between the two points can be determined from the chord length. The great circle distance is proportional to the central angle.

The great circle chord length, &lt;math&gt;C_h\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, may be calculated as follows for the corresponding unit sphere, by means of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian subtraction]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta{X}&amp;=\cos\phi_2\cdot\cos\lambda_2 - \cos\phi_1\cdot\cos\lambda_1;\\
\Delta{Y}&amp;=\cos\phi_2\cdot\sin\lambda_2 - \cos\phi_1\cdot\sin\lambda_1;\\
\Delta{Z}&amp;=\sin\phi_2 - \sin\phi_1;\\
C&amp;=\sqrt{(\Delta{X})^2+(\Delta{Y})^2+(\Delta{Z})^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The central angle is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\sigma=2\arcsin \frac{C}{2} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Radius for spherical Earth==
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
{{main|Earth radius}}
The [[geoid|shape of the Earth]] closely resembles a flattened sphere (a [[spheroid]]) with equatorial radius &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of 6378.137&amp;nbsp;km; distance &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the spheroid to each pole is 6356.752&amp;nbsp;km. When calculating the length of a short north-south line at the equator, the circle that best approximates that line has a radius of &lt;math&gt;b^2/a&lt;/math&gt; (which equals the meridian's [[Conic section#Features|semi-latus rectum]]), or 6335.439&amp;nbsp;km, while the spheroid at the poles is best approximated by a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;a^2/b&lt;/math&gt;, or 6399.594&amp;nbsp;km, a 1% difference. So long as a spherical Earth is assumed, any single formula for distance on the Earth is only guaranteed correct within 0.5% (though better accuracy is possible if the formula is only intended to apply to a limited area). Using the [[Earth radius#Mean_radius|mean earth radius]], &lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac13(2a+b) \approx 6371\,\mathrm{km}&lt;/math&gt; (for the [[WGS84]] ellipsoid) means that in the limit of small flattening, the mean square [[Relative error#Definitions|relative error]] in the estimates for distance is minimized.&lt;ref name=mccaw32&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Greedy colourings.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|An optimal greedy coloring (left) and Grundy coloring (right) of a [[crown graph]]. The numbers indicate the order in which the greedy algorithm colors the vertices.]]
In [[graph theory]], the '''Grundy number''' or '''Grundy chromatic number''' of an [[undirected graph]] is the maximum number of colors that can be used by a [[greedy coloring]] strategy that considers the vertices of the graph in sequence and assigns each vertex its [[Mex (mathematics)|first available]] color, using a vertex ordering chosen to use as many colors as possible. Grundy numbers are named after [[Patrick Michael Grundy|P. M. Grundy]], who studied an analogous concept for [[directed graph]]s in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=P. M.|last=Grundy|authorlink=Patrick Michael Grundy|title=Mathematics and games|journal=[[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|Eureka]]|volume=2|year=1939|pages=6–8|url=http://www.archim.org.uk/eureka/27/games.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192024/http://www.archim.org.uk/eureka/27/games.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}.

==Example==
For example, for a [[path graph]] with four vertices, the [[chromatic number]] is two but the Grundy number is three: if the two endpoints of the path are colored first, the greedy coloring algorithm will use three colors for the whole graph.

==Atoms==
{{harvtxt|Zaker|2006}}
defines a sequence of graphs called {{mvar|t}}-''atoms'', with the property that a graph has Grundy number at least {{mvar|t}} if and only if it contains a {{mvar|t}}-atom.
Each {{mvar|t}}-atom is formed from an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] and a {{math|(''t'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-atom, by adding one edge from each vertex of the {{math|(''t'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-atom to a vertex of the independent set, in such a way that each member of the independent set has at least one edge incident to it.
A Grundy coloring of a {{mvar|t}}-atom can be obtained by coloring the independent set first with the smallest-numbered color, and then coloring the remaining {{math|(''t'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-atom with an additional {{math|''t'' &amp;minus; 1}} colors.
For instance, the only 1-atom is a single vertex, and the only 2-atom is a single edge, but there are two possible 3-atoms: a triangle and a four-vertex path.&lt;ref name="z"/&gt;

==In sparse graphs==
For a graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices and [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] {{mvar|d}}, the Grundy number is {{math|''O''(''d'' log ''n'')}}. In particular, for graphs of bounded degeneracy (such as [[planar graph]]s) or graphs for which the [[chromatic number]] and degeneracy are bounded within constant factors of each other (such as [[chordal graph]]s) the Grundy number and chromatic number are within a logarithmic factor of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Computational complexity==
Testing whether the Grundy number of a given graph is at least {{mvar|k}}, for a fixed constant {{mvar|k}}, can be performed in [[polynomial time]], by searching for all possible {{mvar|k}}-atoms that might be subgraphs of the given graph. However, this algorithm is not [[Parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable]], because the exponent in its running time depends on {{mvar|k}}. When {{mvar|k}} is an input variable rather than a parameter, the problem is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref name="z"&gt;{{citation

==Well-colored graphs==
A graph is called well-colored if its Grundy number equals its chromatic number. Testing whether a graph is well-colored is coNP-complete.&lt;ref name="z"/&gt; The [[Hereditary property|hereditarily]] well-colored graphs (graphs for which every [[induced subgraph]] is well-colored) are exactly the [[cograph]]s, the graphs that do not have a four-vertex path as an induced subgraph.&lt;ref name="cs79"/&gt;

They find uses in both theoretical and applied mathematics, in particular for calculations involving three-dimensional rotations.

== Hamilton's discovery ==
In 1843, Hamilton knew that the [[complex number]]s could be viewed as [[point (geometry)|point]]s in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and that they could be added and multiplied together using certain geometric operations.  Hamilton sought to find a way to do the same for points in [[space]]. Points in space can be represented by their coordinates, which are triples of numbers and have an obvious addition, but Hamilton had difficulty defining the appropriate multiplication.

According to a letter Hamilton wrote later to his son Archibald:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Every morning in the early part of October 1843, on my coming down to breakfast, your brother [[William Edwin Hamilton|William Edwin]] and yourself used to ask me: "Well, Papa, can you multiply triples?"  Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of the head, "No, I can only add and subtract them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 16, 1843, Hamilton and his wife took a walk along the [[Royal Canal]] in [[Dublin]]. While they walked across Brougham Bridge (now [[Broom Bridge]]), a solution suddenly occurred to him. While he could not "multiply triples", he saw a way to do so for ''quadruples''. By using three of the numbers in the quadruple as the points of a coordinate in space, Hamilton could represent points in space by his new system of numbers. He then carved the basic rules for multiplication into the bridge:
:&lt;math&gt;i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hamilton called a quadruple with these rules of multiplication a ''quaternion'', and he devoted the remainder of his life to studying and teaching them. From 1844 to 1850 [[Philosophical Magazine]] communicated Hamilton's exposition of quaternions.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Hamilton(1844 to 1850) [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/OnQuat/ On quaternions or a new system of imaginaries in algebra], [[Philosophical Magazine]], link to David R. Wilkins collection at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 he issued ''Lectures on Quaternions'', a comprehensive treatise that also described [[biquaternion]]s. The facility of the algebra in expressing geometric relationships led to broad acceptance of the method, several compositions by other authors, and stimulation of applied algebra generally. As mathematical terminology has grown since that time, and usage of some terms has changed, the traditional expressions are referred to [[classical Hamiltonian quaternion]]s.

== Precursors ==

Hamilton's innovation consisted of expressing quaternions as an [[algebra over a field|algebra over '''R''']]. The formulae for the multiplication of quaternions are implicit in the [[four squares formula]] devised by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1748; [[Olinde Rodrigues]] applied this formula to representing rotations in 1840.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;[[John H. Conway]] &amp; Derek A. Smith (2003) ''On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry'', [[A K Peters]], {{ISBN|1-56881-134-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

== Response ==
The special claims of quaternions as the algebra of [[four-dimensional space]] were challenged by [[James Cockle]] with his exhibits in 1848 and 1849 of [[tessarine]]s and [[coquaternion]]s as alternatives. Nevertheless, these new algebras from Cockle were, in fact, to be found inside Hamilton’s [[biquaternion]]s. From Italy, in 1858 [[Giusto Bellavitis]] responded&lt;ref&gt;[[Giusto Bellavitis]] ( 1858) [https://archive.is/20141101193025/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000003356951;view=1up;seq=1 Calcolo dei Quaternioni di W.R. Hamilton e sua Relazione col Metodo delle Equipollenze], link from HathiTrust&lt;/ref&gt; to connect Hamilton’s vector theory with his theory of [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]]s of directed line segments.

[[Jules Hoüel]] led the response from France in 1874 with a textbook on the elements of quaternions. To ease the study of [[versor]]s, he introduced "biradials" to designate great circle arcs on the sphere. Then the quaternion algebra provided the foundation for [[spherical trigonometry]]  introduced in chapter 9. Hoüel replaced Hamilton’s basis vectors '''i,j,k''' with i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,   i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and i&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
The variety of typefaces (fonts) available led Hoüel to another notational innovation: ''A'' designates a point, ''a'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{a}&lt;/math&gt; are algebraic quantities, and in the equation for a quaternion
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{ A} = \cos \alpha + \mathbf{A} \sin \alpha ,&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector and &amp;alpha; is an angle. This style of quaternion exposition was perpetuated by [[Charles-Ange Laisant]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Laisant]]  (1881) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WvMGAAAAYAAJ Introduction a la Méthode des Quaternions], link from [[Google Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Macfarlane]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Macfarlane (1894) ''[https://archive.org/details/principlesalgeb01macfgoog Papers on Space Analysis]'', B. Westerman, New York, weblink from [[archive.org]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William K. Clifford]] expanded the types of biquaternions, and explored [[elliptic space]], a geometry in which the points can be viewed as versors. Fascination with quaternions began before the language of [[set theory]] and [[mathematical structure]]s was available. In fact, there was little [[mathematical notation]] before the [[Formulario mathematico]]. The quaternions stimulated these advances: For example, the idea of a [[vector space]] borrowed Hamilton’s term but changed its meaning. Under the modern understanding, any quaternion is a vector in four-dimensional space. (Hamilton’s vectors lie in the subspace with scalar part zero.)

Since quaternions demand their readers to imagine four dimensions, there is a metaphysical aspect to their invocation. Quaternions are a [[object (philosophy)|philosophical object]]. Setting quaternions before freshmen students of engineering asks too much. Yet the utility of [[dot product]]s and [[cross product]]s in [[three-dimensional space]], for illustration of processes, calls for the uses of these operations which are cut out of the quaternion product. Thus [[Willard Gibbs]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] made this accommodation, for pragmatism, to avoid the distracting superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe (1967) [[A History of Vector Analysis]], [[University of Notre Dame Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For mathematicians the quaternion structure became familiar and lost its status as something mathematically interesting. Thus in England, when [[Arthur Buchheim]] prepared a paper on biquaternions, it was published in the [[American Journal of Mathematics]] since some novelty in the subject lingered there.  Research turned to [[hypercomplex number]]s more generally. For instance, [[Thomas Kirkman]] and [[Arthur Cayley]] considered the number of equations between basis vectors would be necessary to determine a unique system. The wide interest that quaternions aroused around the world resulted in the [[Quaternion Society]]. In contemporary mathematics, the [[division ring]] of quaternions exemplifies an [[algebra over a field]].

== Octonions ==
{{main|octonion}}

[[Octonion]]s were developed independently by [[Arthur Cayley]] in 1845 &lt;ref&gt;Penrose 2004 pg 202&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[John T. Graves]], a friend of Hamilton's. Graves had interested Hamilton in algebra, and responded to his discovery of quaternions with "If with your alchemy you can make three pounds of gold [the three imaginary units], why should you stop there?"{{Sfn|Baez|2002|p=146}}

Two months after Hamilton's discovery of quaternions, Graves wrote Hamilton on December 26, 1843 presenting a kind of double quaternion&lt;ref&gt;See Penrose Road to Reality pg. 202 'Graves discovered that there exists a kind of double quaternion...'&lt;/ref&gt; that is called an ''octonion'', and showed that they were what we now call a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]ed [[division algebra]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}; Graves called them ''octaves''. Hamilton needed a way to distinguish between two different types of double quaternions, the associative [[biquaternion]]s and the octaves.  He spoke about them to the Royal Irish Society and credited his friend Graves for the discovery of the second type of double quaternion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TCwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=octaves+hamilton+thinks&amp;as_brr=1#PRA1-PA730,M1  Hamilton 1853 pg 740See a hard copy of Lectures on quaternions, appendix B, half of the hyphenated word double quaternion has been cut off in the online Edition ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Hamilton's talk to the Royal Irish Academy on the subject&lt;/ref&gt; observed in reply that they were not [[associativity|associative]], which may have been the invention of the concept. He also promised to get Graves' work published, but did little about it; Cayley, working independently of Graves, but inspired by Hamilton's publication of his own work, published on octonions in March 1845&amp;nbsp;– as an appendix to a paper on a different subject. Hamilton was stung into protesting Graves' priority in discovery, if not publication; nevertheless, octonions are known by the name Cayley gave them&amp;nbsp;– or as ''Cayley numbers''.

The major deduction from the existence of octonions was the [[Degen's eight-square identity|eight squares theorem]], which follows directly from the product rule from octonions, had also been previously discovered as a purely algebraic identity, by [[Carl Ferdinand Degen]] in 1818.{{Sfn|Baez|2002|p=146-7}} This sum-of-squares identity is characteristic of [[composition algebra]], a feature of complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions.

== Mathematical uses ==
{{main| quaternions}}

Quaternions continued to be a well-studied ''mathematical'' structure in the twentieth century, as the third term in the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] of [[hypercomplex number]] systems over the reals, followed by the [[octonion]]s and the [[sedenion]]s; they are also useful tool in [[number theory]], particularly in the study of the representation of numbers as sums of squares. The group of eight basic unit quaternions, positive and negative, the [[quaternion group]], is also the simplest non-commutative [[Sylow group]].

The study of [[integral quaternion]]s began with [[Rudolf Lipschitz]] in 1886, whose system was  later simplified by [[Leonard Eugene Dickson]]; but the modern system was published by [[Adolf Hurwitz]] in 1919. The difference between them consists of which quaternions are accounted integral: Lipschitz included only those quaternions with integral coordinates, but Hurwitz added those quaternions ''all four'' of whose coordinates are [[half-integers]]. Both systems are closed under subtraction and multiplication, and are therefore [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, but Lipschitz's system does not permit unique factorization, while Hurwitz's does.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright, ''Introduction to Number Theory'', §20.6-10''n'' (pp. 315–316, 1968 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Quaternions as rotations ==
{{main| Quaternions and spatial rotation}}

Quaternions are a concise  method of representing the [[automorphism]]s of three- and four-dimensional spaces. They have the technical advantage that [[unit quaternion]]s form the [[simply connected]] cover of the space of three-dimensional rotations.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;{{rp|ch 2}}

For this reason, quaternions are used in [[computer graphics]],&lt;ref&gt;Ken Shoemaker (1985), [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiranb/animation/p245-shoemake.pdf Animating Rotation with Quaternion Curves], ''[[Computer Graphics (publication)|Computer Graphics]]'', '''19'''(3), 245–254.  Presented at [[SIGGRAPH]] '85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[control theory]], [[robotics]],&lt;ref&gt;J. M. McCarthy, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=glOqQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=introduction+to+theoretical+kinematics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgoIOmnMncAhUPUK0KHT3cB5gQ6AEIJzAA ''Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics''], MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[signal processing]], [[attitude control]], [[physics]], [[bioinformatics]], and [[orbital mechanics]]. For example, it is common for spacecraft attitude-control systems to be commanded in terms of quaternions. ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' (1996) is often cited as the first mass-market computer game to have used quaternions to achieve smooth 3D rotation.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Bobick (February 1998) "[http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19980703/quaternions_01.htm Rotating Objects Using Quaternions]", [[Game Developer (magazine)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Quaternions have received another boost from [[number theory]] because of their relation to [[quadratic form]]s.

== Memorial ==
Since 1989, the Department of Mathematics of the [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth]] has organized a pilgrimage, where scientists (including physicists [[Murray Gell-Mann]] in 2002, [[Steven Weinberg]] in 2005, [[Frank Wilczek]] in 2007, and mathematician [[Andrew Wiles]] in 2003) take a walk from [[Dunsink Observatory]] to the Royal Canal bridge where, unfortunately, no trace of Hamilton's carving remains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.nuim.ie/links/hamilton.shtml Hamilton walk] at the [[National University of Ireland, Maynooth]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Idempotent relations have been used as an example to illustrate the application of Mechanized Formalisation
of mathematics using the interactive theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. Besides checking the mathematical properties of finite idempotent relations, an algorithm for counting the number of idempotent relations has been derived in Isabelle/HOL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2769">In [[constructive mathematics]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' is '''inhabited''' if there exists an element &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;.  In classical mathematics, this is the same as the set being nonempty; however, this equivalence is not valid in [[intuitionistic logic]].

== Comparison with nonempty sets ==
In [[classical mathematics]], a set is inhabited if and only if it is not the [[empty set]].  These definitions diverge in [[constructive mathematics]], however.  A set ''A'' is ''nonempty'' if it is not empty, that is, if 
:&lt;math&gt;\lnot [\forall z (z \not \in A)].&lt;/math&gt;
It is ''inhabited'' if 
:&lt;math&gt;\exists z (z \in A).&lt;/math&gt;
In intuitionistic logic, the negation of a universal quantifier is weaker than an existential quantifier, not equivalent to it as in [[classical logic]].

== Example ==
Because inhabited sets are the same as nonempty sets in classical logic, it is not possible to produce a [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]] in the classical sense that contains a nonempty set ''X'' but does not satisfy "''X'' is inhabited". But it is possible to construct a [[Kripke model]] ''M'' that satisfies "''X'' is nonempty" without satisfying "''X'' is inhabited".  Because an implication is provable in intuitionistic logic if and only if it is true in every Kripke model, this means that one cannot prove in this logic that "''X'' is nonempty" implies "''X'' is inhabited".

The possibility of this construction relies on the intuitionistic interpretation of the existential quantifier.  In an intuitionistic setting, in order for &lt;math&gt;\exists z \phi(z)&lt;/math&gt; to hold, for some formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, it is necessary for a specific value of ''z'' satisfying &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; to be known.

For example, consider a subset ''X'' of {0,1} [[axiom of specification|specified]] by the following rule: 0 belongs to ''X'' if and only if the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true, and 1 belongs to ''X'' if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is false. If we assume that Riemann hypothesis is either true or false, then ''X'' is not empty, but any constructive proof that ''X'' is inhabited would either prove that 0 is in ''X'' or that 1 is in ''X''.  Thus a constructive proof that ''X'' is inhabited would determine the truth value of the Riemann hypothesis, which is not known, By replacing the Riemann hypothesis in this example by a generic proposition, one can construct a Kripke model with a set that is neither empty nor inhabited (even if the Riemann hypothesis itself is ever proved or refuted).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">In [[mathematics]], in the field of  [[differential geometry]], an '''Iwasawa manifold''' is a compact quotient of a 3-dimensional complex [[Heisenberg group]] by a [[cocompact]], [[Discrete group|discrete]] subgroup.  An 
Iwasawa manifold is a [[nilmanifold]], of real dimension 6.

Iwasawa manifolds give examples where the first two terms ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[Frölicher spectral sequence]] are not isomorphic. 

As a [[complex manifold]], such an Iwasawa manifold is an important example of
a compact complex manifold which does not admit any [[Kähler metric]].

'''Jan Łukasiewicz''' ({{IPA-pol|ˈjan wukaˈɕɛvʲitʂ|lang}}; 21 December 1878 – 13 February 1956) was a Polish [[logician]] and [[philosopher]] born in [[Lemberg]], a city in the [[Austrian Galicia|Galicia]]n kingdom of [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Lviv]], [[Ukraine]]). His work centred on [[philosophical logic]], [[mathematical logic]], and [[history of logic]]. He thought innovatively about traditional [[propositional logic]], the principle of [[principle of contradiction|non-contradiction]] and the [[law of excluded middle]]. Modern work on Aristotle's logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Łukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. The Łukasiewicz approach was reinvigorated in the early 1970s in a series of papers by [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]]  and [[Timothy Smiley]]—which inform modern translations of ''Prior Analytics'' by Robin Smith in 1989 and [[Gisela Striker]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;*Review of "Aristotle, Prior Analytics: Book I, Gisela Striker (translation and commentary), Oxford UP, 2009, 268pp., $39.95 (pbk), {{ISBN|978-0-19-925041-7}}." in the ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', [http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=18787 2010.02.02].&lt;/ref&gt; Łukasiewicz is regarded as one of the most important historians of logic.

== Life ==
He grew up in Lwów and was the only child of Paweł Łukasiewicz, a captain in the Austrian army, and Leopoldina, ''née'' Holtzer, the daughter of a civil servant. His family was [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].

He finished his ''[[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' studies in philology and in 1897 went on to [[Lviv University|Lwów University]] (which, before the [[Partitions of Poland|Polish partitions]], had been in Poland), where he studied philosophy and mathematics.  He was a pupil of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]].

In 1902 he received a Doctor of Philosophy degree under the patronage of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]], who gave him a special doctoral ring with diamonds.

He spent three years as a private teacher, and in 1905 he received a scholarship to complete his philosophy studies at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and the [[Old University of Louvain|University of Louvain]] in Belgium.

Łukasiewicz continued studying for his [[habilitation]] qualification and in 1906 submitted his thesis to the University of Lwów. In 1906 he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Lwów where he was eventually appointed Extraordinary Professor by Emperor Franz Joseph I. He taught there until the [[World War I|First World War]].

In 1915 he was invited to lecture as a full professor at the [[University of Warsaw]] which had re-opened after being closed down by the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist government]] in the 19th century.

In 1919 Łukasiewicz left the university to serve as Polish Minister of Religious Denominations and Public Education in the [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] government until 1920. Łukasiewicz led the development of a Polish curriculum replacing the Russian, German and Austrian curricula previously used in partitioned Poland. The Łukasiewicz curriculum emphasized the early acquisition of logical and mathematical concepts.

In 1928 he married Regina Barwińska.

He remained a professor at the University of Warsaw from 1920 until 1939 when the family house was destroyed by German bombs and the university was closed under German occupation. He had been a rector of the university twice. In this period Łukasiewicz and [[Stanisław Leśniewski]] founded the [[Lwów–Warsaw school of logic]] which was later made internationally famous by [[Alfred Tarski]] who had been Leśniewski's student.

At the beginning of [[World War II]] he worked at the Warsaw [[Underground University]] as part of the secret system of [[education in Poland during World War II]].

He and his wife wanted to move to [[Switzerland]] but couldn't get permission from the German authorities. Instead, in the summer of 1944, they left Poland with the help of [[Heinrich Scholz]] and spent the last few months of the war in [[Münster]], Germany hoping to somehow go on further, perhaps to Switzerland.

Following the war, he emigrated to Ireland and worked at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) until his death.

Jan Łukasiewicz's papers (post-1945 only) are held by the [[University of Manchester Library]].

== Work ==
A number of axiomatizations of [[classical logic|classical]] [[propositional logic]] are due to Łukasiewicz. A particularly elegant axiomatization features a mere three [[axioms]] and is still invoked to the present day. He was a pioneer investigator of [[multi-valued logic]]s; his [[Trivalent logic|three-valued propositional calculus]], introduced in 1917, was the first explicitly axiomatized [[Classical logic|non-classical]] [[propositional calculus|logical calculus]]. He wrote on the [[philosophy of science]], and his approach to the making of scientific theories was similar to the thinking of [[Karl Popper]].

Łukasiewicz invented the [[Polish notation]] (named after his nationality) for the logical connectives around 1920. There is a quotation from his paper, ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'', page 180;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924.  I used that notation for the first time in my article Łukasiewicz(1), p. 610, footnote."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The reference cited by Łukasiewicz above is apparently a lithographed report in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The referring paper by Łukasiewicz ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction"'', originally published in Polish in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, Jan, "Uwagi o aksjomacie Nicoda i 'dedukcji uogólniającej'",
("Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and the "Generalizing Deduction"), Księga pamiątkowa Polskiego Towarzystwa Filozoficznego, Lwów 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; was later reviewed by [[Henry Pogorzelski|H. A. Pogorzelski]] in the ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Pogorzelski, H. A., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2269644 "Reviewed work(s): Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on "Generalizing Deduction" by Jan Łukasiewicz; Jerzy Słupecki; Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe"], ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (Sep. 1965), pp. 376–377. This paper by Jan Łukasiewicz was re-published in Warsaw in 1961 in a volume edited by [[Jerzy Słupecki]]. It had been published originally in 1931 in Polish.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Łukasiewicz 1951 book, ''Aristotle's Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the functors before the arguments to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Łukasiewicz, (1951) ''Aristotle’s Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', Chapter IV "Aristotle's System in Symbolic Form" (section on "Explanation of the Symbolism"), p.78 and on.&lt;/ref&gt; He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with [[Alfred Tarski]] on the [[Propositional calculus|sentential calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, Jan; Tarski, Alfred, "Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül" ["Investigations into
the sentential calculus"], ''Comptes Rendus des séances de la Société des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie'', Vol. 23 (1930) Cl. III, pp. 31–32. This paper can be found translated into English in Chapter IV "Investigations into the Sentential Calculus", pp.39-59, in ''Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics: Papers from 1923 to 1938 by Alfred Tarski'', translated into English by J.H. Woodger, Oxford University Press, 1956; 2nd edition, Hackett Publishing Company, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

This notation is the root of the idea of the ''recursive stack'', a last-in, first-out computer memory store proposed by several researchers including [[Alan Turing|Turing]], [[Friedrich L. Bauer|Bauer]] and [[Charles Leonard Hamblin|Hamblin]], and first implemented in 1957. In 1960, Łukasiewicz notation concepts and stacks were used as the basis of the [[Burroughs large systems|Burroughs B5000]] computer designed by [[Robert S. Barton]] and his team at [[Burroughs Corporation]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The concepts also led to the design of the English Electric multi-programmed [[English Electric KDF9|KDF9]] computer system of 1963, which had two such hardware register stacks. A similar concept underlies the [[reverse Polish notation]] (''RPN'', a postfix notation) of the [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130 calculator and its successors, many [[Hewlett Packard]] calculators, the [[Forth (programming language)|Forth programming language]], and the [[PostScript]] page description language.

==Recognition==
In 2008 the [[Polish Information Processing Society]] established the Jan Łukasiewicz Award, to be presented to the most innovative Polish IT companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2010.imcsit.org/pg/331/261 "2009 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology (IMCSIT)"], conference report&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1999 to 2004, the Department of Computer Science building at UCD was called the Łukasiewicz Building, until all campus buildings were renamed after the disciplines they  housed.

'''Josiah Willard Gibbs''' (February 11, 1839 &amp;ndash; April 28, 1903) was an American scientist who made important theoretical contributions to physics, chemistry, and mathematics. His work on the applications of [[thermodynamics]] was instrumental in transforming [[physical chemistry]] into a rigorous inductive science. Together with [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], he created [[statistical mechanics]] (a term that he coined), explaining the [[laws of thermodynamics]] as consequences of the statistical properties of [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensembles]] of the possible states of a physical system composed of many particles. Gibbs also worked on the application of [[Maxwell's equations]] to problems in [[physical optics]].  As a mathematician, he invented modern [[vector calculus]] (independently of the British scientist [[Oliver Heaviside]], who carried out similar work during the same period).

In 1863, [[Yale University|Yale]] awarded Gibbs the first American [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in [[engineering]]. After a three-year sojourn in Europe, Gibbs spent the rest of his career at Yale, where he was professor of [[mathematical physics]] from 1871 until his death. Working in relative isolation, he became the earliest theoretical scientist in the United States to earn an international reputation and was praised by [[Albert Einstein]] as "the greatest mind in American history".&lt;ref name="APS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/history/historicsites/gibbs.cfm |title=J. Willard Gibbs |author= |date= |work=Physics History |publisher=American Physical Society |accessdate=16 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, Gibbs received what was then considered the highest honor awarded by the international scientific community, the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] of London,&lt;ref name="APS" /&gt; "for his contributions to mathematical physics".&lt;ref name="Copley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalsociety.org/awards/copley-medal/ |title=Copley Medal |author= |date= |work=Premier Awards |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=16 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators and biographers have remarked on the contrast between Gibbs's quiet, solitary life in turn of the century [[New England]] and the great international impact of his ideas.  Though his work was almost entirely theoretical, the practical value of Gibbs's contributions became evident with the development of industrial chemistry during the first half of the 20th century. According to [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert A. Millikan]], in pure science, Gibbs "did for statistical mechanics and for thermodynamics what [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] did for celestial mechanics and Maxwell did for electrodynamics, namely, made his field a well-nigh finished theoretical structure".&lt;ref name="Millikan"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Millikan |first=Robert A. |authorlink=Robert Andrews Millikan |year=1938 |title=Biographical Memoir of Albert Abraham Michelson, 1852–1931 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=121–146| url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/michelson-a-a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Family background ===
[[File:A young Willard Gibbs.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Willard Gibbs as a young man]]

Gibbs was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He belonged to an old [[Yankee]] family that had produced distinguished American clergymen and academics since the 17th century. He was the fourth of five children and the only son of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs, Sr.|Josiah Willard Gibbs]] Sr., and his wife Mary Anna, ''née'' Van Cleve. On his father's side, he was descended from [[Samuel Willard]], who served as acting [[President of Harvard University|President of Harvard College]] from 1701 to 1707. On his mother's side, one of his ancestors was the Rev. [[Jonathan Dickinson (New Jersey)|Jonathan Dickinson]], the first president of the College of New Jersey (later [[Princeton University]]). Gibbs's given name, which he shared with his father and several other members of his extended family, derived from his ancestor Josiah Willard, who had been Secretary of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Bumstead"&gt;Bumstead 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

The elder Gibbs was generally known to his family and colleagues as "Josiah", while the son was called "Willard".&lt;ref&gt;Cropper 2001, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Josiah Gibbs was a linguist and theologian who served as professor of sacred literature at [[Yale Divinity School]] from 1824 until his death in 1861. He is chiefly remembered today as the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] who found an interpreter for the African passengers of the ship ''[[La Amistad|Amistad]]'', allowing them to testify during [[United States v.

Willard Gibbs was educated at the [[Hopkins School]] and entered [[Yale College]] in 1854 at the age of 15. At Yale, Gibbs received prizes for excellence in [[mathematics]] and [[Latin]], and he graduated in 1858, near the top of his class.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Gibbs.html |title=Josiah Willard Gibbs | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = John J. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = Edmund F. | year = 1997 | work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive |publisher=University of St Andrews, Scotland. School of Mathematics and Statistics |accessdate=16 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained at Yale as a graduate student at the [[Sheffield Scientific School]]. At age 19, soon after his graduation from college, Gibbs was inducted into the [[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]], a scholarly institution composed primarily of members of the Yale faculty.&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-CTAcademy"&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively few documents from the period survive and it is difficult to reconstruct the details of Gibbs's early career with precision.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-college"&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;23–24&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of biographers, Gibbs's principal mentor and champion, both at Yale and in the Connecticut Academy, was probably the astronomer and mathematician [[Hubert Anson Newton]], a leading authority on [[Meteoroid|meteors]], who remained Gibbs's lifelong friend and confidant.&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-CTAcademy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler-college" /&gt; After the death of his father in 1861, Gibbs inherited enough money to make him financially independent.&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-inheritance"&gt;Rukeyser 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;120, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Recurrent [[Lung|pulmonary]] trouble ailed the young Gibbs and his physicians were concerned that he might be susceptible to [[tuberculosis]], which had killed his mother. He also suffered from [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]], whose treatment was then still largely unfamiliar to [[Ophthalmology|oculists]], so that Gibbs had to diagnose himself and grind his own lenses.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-astigmatism"&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;29–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-astigmatism"&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Though in later years he used [[glasses]] only for reading or other close work,&lt;ref name="Wheeler-astigmatism"/&gt; Gibbs's delicate health and imperfect eyesight probably explain why he did not volunteer to fight in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] of 1861–65.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-war"&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  He was not [[Conscription in the United States#Civil War|conscripted]] and he remained at Yale for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-war"&gt;Rukeyser 1998, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JWGibbs-tutor.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of Willard Gibbs as a Yale College tutor|Gibbs during his time as a tutor at Yale&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1863, Gibbs received the first [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in engineering granted in the US, for a thesis entitled "On the Form of the Teeth of Wheels in Spur Gearing", in which he used geometrical techniques to investigate the optimum design for [[gear]]s.&lt;ref name="MacTutor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler-PhD"&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url =http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3439123 | title =On the form of the teeth of wheels in spur gearing | last =Gibbs | first =Josiah W. | date =1863 | website =Yale University Library | access-date =27 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861, Yale had become the first US university to offer a Ph.D. degree&lt;ref name="ElmarsafyBernard2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ziad Elmarsafy|author2=Anna Bernard|title=Debating Orientalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VP6ARP2m-D0C&amp;pg=PA85|date=13 June 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-34111-2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gibbs's was only the fifth Ph.D. granted in the US in any subject.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-PhD"/&gt;

===Career, 1863&amp;ndash;73===

After graduation, Gibbs was appointed as tutor at the College for a term of three years. During the first two years, he taught Latin and during the third year, he taught "natural philosophy" (i.e., physics).&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt; In 1866, he patented a design for a [[railway brake]]&lt;ref&gt;US Patent No. 53,971, "Car Brake", Apr. 17, 1866.  See ''The Early Work of Willard Gibbs in Applied Mechanics'', (New York: Henry Schuman, 1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;51–62.&lt;/ref&gt; and read a paper before the Connecticut Academy, entitled "The Proper Magnitude of the Units of Length", in which he proposed a scheme for rationalizing the system of units of measurement used in mechanics.&lt;ref name="Units"&gt;Wheeler 1998, appendix II&lt;/ref&gt;

After his term as tutor ended, Gibbs traveled to Europe with his sisters. They spent the winter of 1866–67 in Paris, where Gibbs attended lectures at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and the [[Collège de France]], given by such distinguished mathematical scientists as [[Joseph Liouville]] and [[Michel Chasles]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Having undertaken a punishing regime of study, Gibbs caught a serious cold and a doctor, fearing tuberculosis, advised him to rest on the [[French Riviera|Riviera]], where he and his sisters spent several months and where he made a full recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving to [[Berlin]], Gibbs attended the lectures taught by mathematicians [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Leopold Kronecker]], as well as by chemist [[Heinrich Gustav Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 1867, Gibbs's sister Julia was married in Berlin to [[Addison Van Name]], who had been Gibbs's classmate at Yale.  The newly married couple returned to New Haven, leaving Gibbs and his sister Anna in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], Gibbs was exposed to the work of physicists [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], and chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]. At the time, German academics were the leading authorities in the natural sciences, especially chemistry and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;158–161&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs returned to Yale in June 1869 and briefly taught French to engineering students.&lt;ref name="Klein-proceedings"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The Physics of J. Willard Gibbs in His Time | last = Klein | first = Martin J. | title = Proceedings of the Gibbs Symposium | year = 1990 |pages = 3, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was probably also around this time that he worked on a new design for a steam-engine [[Governor (device)|governor]], his last significant investigation in mechanical engineering.&lt;ref name="Mayr"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1971.0019 |title=Victorian physicists and speed regulation: An encounter between science and technology |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=205–228 |year=1971 |last1=Mayr |first1=Otto }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–55&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1871, he was appointed Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale, the first such professorship in the United States. Gibbs, who had independent means and had yet to publish anything, was assigned to teach graduate students exclusively and was hired without salary.&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-professor"&gt;Rukeyser 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;181–182&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career, 1873-80===
[[File:Maxwell's letters plate IV.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Maxwell's handmade sketch of the thermodynamic surface for water|right|Maxwell's sketch of the lines of constant temperature and pressure, made in preparation for his construction of a solid model based on Gibbs's definition of a thermodynamic surface for water (see [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface]])]]

Gibbs published his first work in 1873.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; His papers on the geometric representation of thermodynamic quantities appeared in the ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy''. These papers introduced the use of different type phase diagrams, which were his favorite aids to the imagination process when doing research, rather than the mechanical models, such as the ones that [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] used in constructing his electromagnetic theory, which might not completely represent their corresponding phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/helios/fachinfo/www/math/htmg/gibbs-bumstead.htm | title =Josiah Willard Gibbs [Reprinted with some additions from the American Journal of Science, ser. 4, vol. xvi., September, 1903.] | last =Bumstead | first =Henry A. | publisher =Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg | access-date =2015-09-30 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20140427182622/http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/helios/fachinfo/www/math/htmg/gibbs-bumstead.htm | archive-date =2014-04-27 | dead-url =yes | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the journal had few readers capable of understanding Gibbs's work, he shared reprints with correspondents in Europe and received an enthusiastic response from [[James Clerk Maxwell]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. Maxwell even made, with his own hands, a [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|clay model illustrating Gibbs's construct]]. He then produced two plaster casts of his model and mailed one to Gibbs. That cast is on display at the Yale physics department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/physrevseriesi.10.228 |title=Gibbs' Thermodynamical Model |journal=Physical Review (Series I) |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=228–233 |year=1900 |last1=Boynton |first1=W.

Maxwell included a chapter on Gibbs's work in the next edition of his ''Theory of Heat'', published in 1875. He explained the usefulness of Gibbs's graphical methods in a lecture to the [[Chemical Society]] of London and even referred to it in the article on "Diagrams" that he wrote for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Prospects of collaboration between him and Gibbs were cut short by Maxwell's early death in 1879, aged 48. The joke later circulated in New Haven that "only one man lived who could understand Gibbs's papers. That was Maxwell, and now he is dead."&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs then extended his thermodynamic analysis to multi-phase chemical systems (i.e., to systems composed of more than one form of matter) and considered a variety of concrete applications.  He described that research in a monograph titled "[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]", published by the Connecticut Academy in two parts that appeared respectively in 1875 and 1878. That work, which covers about three hundred pages and contains exactly seven hundred numbered mathematical equations,&lt;ref name="Cropper-monograph"&gt;Cropper 2001, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; begins with a quotation from [[Rudolf Clausius]] that expresses what would later be called the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]]: "The [[energy]] of the world is constant. The [[entropy]] of the world tends towards a maximum."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rukeyser 1988, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs's monograph rigorously and ingeniously applied his thermodynamic techniques to the interpretation of physico-chemical phenomena, explaining and relating what had previously been a mass of isolated facts and observations.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-thermodynamics"&gt;Wheeler 1998, ch. V&lt;/ref&gt; The work has been described as "the ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' of thermodynamics" and as a work of "practically unlimited scope".&lt;ref name="Cropper-monograph" /&gt; It solidly laid the foundation for physical Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Jordan1910"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Starr Jordan|title=Leading American Men of Science|year=1910|publisher=H. Holt |url=https://archive.org/details/leadingamerican00jordgoog |pages=350|quote=for it laid the foundation of the new science of physical science}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], who translated Gibbs's monograph into German, referred to Gibbs as the "founder of chemical energetics".&lt;ref name="Britannica-1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Gibbs, Josiah Willard}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to modern commentators,

{{quote|It is universally recognised that its publication was an event of the first importance in the history of chemistry&amp;nbsp;... Nevertheless it was a number of years before its value was generally known, this delay was due largely to the fact that its mathematical form and rigorous deductive processes make it difficult reading for anyone, and especially so for students of experimental chemistry whom it most concerns.|J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson, 1997&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt;}}

Gibbs continued to work without pay until 1880, when the new [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] offered him a position paying $3,000 per year. In response, Yale offered him an annual salary of $2,000, which he was content to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career, 1880-1903===
[[File:SloaneLab.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Yale University's old Sloane Physical Laboratory|Yale's Sloane Physical Laboratory, as it stood between 1882 and 1931 at the current location of [[Jonathan Edwards College]]. Gibbs's office was on the second floor, to the right of the tower in the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;]]

From 1880 to 1884, Gibbs worked on developing the [[exterior algebra]] of [[Hermann Grassmann]] into a [[vector calculus]] well-suited to the needs of physicists. With this object in mind, Gibbs distinguished between the [[Dot product|dot]] and [[cross product]]s of two vectors and introduced the concept of [[dyadics]]. Similar work was carried out independently, and at around the same time, by the British mathematical physicist and engineer [[Oliver Heaviside]]. Gibbs sought to convince other physicists of the convenience of the vectorial approach over the [[quaternion]]ic calculus of [[William Rowan Hamilton]], which was then widely used by British scientists. This led him, in the early 1890s, to a controversy with [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] and others in the pages of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt;

Gibbs's lecture notes on vector calculus were privately printed in 1881 and 1884 for the use of his students, and were later adapted by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] into a textbook, ''[[Vector Analysis]]'', published in 1901.&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt; That book helped to popularize the "[[del]]" notation that is widely used today in [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] and [[fluid mechanics]]. In other mathematical work, he re-discovered the "[[Gibbs phenomenon]]" in the theory of [[Fourier series]] (which, unbeknownst to him and to later scholars, had been described fifty years before by an obscure English mathematician, [[Henry Wilbraham]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00330404 |title=The Gibbs-Wilbraham phenomenon: An episode in fourier analysis |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=129–160 |year=1979 |last1=Hewitt |first1=Edwin |last2=Hewitt |first2=Robert E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sine integral.svg|thumb|left|alt=Plot of the sine integral|The [[sine integral]] function, which gives the overshoot associated with the [[Gibbs phenomenon]] for the Fourier series of a [[Heaviside step function|step function]] on the real line]]

From 1882 to 1889, Gibbs wrote five papers on [[physical optics]], in which he investigated [[birefringence]] and other optical phenomena and defended Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light against the mechanical theories of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] and others.&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt; In his work on optics, just as much as in his work on thermodynamics,&lt;ref name=Klein1990&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.881258 |title=The Physics of J. Willard Gibbs in his Time |journal=Physics Today |volume=43 |issue=9 |pages=40–48 |year=1990 |last1=Klein |first1=Martin J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs deliberately avoided speculating about the microscopic structure of matter and purposefully confined his research problems to those that can be solved from broad general principles and experimentally confirmed facts.The methods that he used were highly original and the obtained results showed decisively the correctness of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 121, 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs coined the term ''statistical mechanics'' and introduced key concepts in the corresponding mathematical description of physical systems, including the notions of [[chemical potential]] (1876),&lt;ref name="Klein-proceedings"/&gt; and [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|statistical ensemble]] (1902).&lt;ref name="Caldi"&gt;{{cite book | editor1= Caldi, D. G. | editor2 = Mostow, G. D.  | title = Proceedings of the Gibbs Symposium | year = 1990 |pages = 143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs's derivation of the laws of thermodynamics from the statistical properties of systems consisting of many particles was presented in his highly influential textbook ''Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics'', published in 1902, a year before his death.&lt;ref name=Klein1990 /&gt;

Gibbs's retiring personality and intense focus on his work limited his accessibility to students. His principal protégé was Edwin Bidwell Wilson, who nonetheless explained that "except in the classroom I saw very little of Gibbs. He had a way, toward the end of the afternoon, of taking a stroll about the streets between his study in the old Sloane Laboratory and his home&amp;mdash;a little exercise between work and dinner&amp;mdash;and one might occasionally come across him at that time."&lt;ref name="Wilson-reminiscences "&gt;Wilson 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs did supervise the doctoral thesis on mathematical economics written by [[Irving Fisher]] in 1891.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1930-04919-8 |title=The application of mathematics to the social sciences |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=225–244 |year=1930 |last1=Fisher |first1=Irving }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gibbs's death, Fisher financed the publication of his ''Collected Works''.&lt;ref name="Celebrating-Fisher"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher |first=George W. |chapter=Foreword |title=Celebrating Irving Fisher: The Legacy of a Great Economist |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2005 |chapter-url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/books/gean/fisher.htm |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616203239/http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/books/gean/fisher.htm |archivedate=2006-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinguished student was [[Lee De Forest]], later a pioneer of radio technology.&lt;ref name="DeForest"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schiff |first=Judith |title=The man who invented radio |url=http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/2285 |journal=Yale Alumni Magazine |volume=72 |issue=2 |date=November 2008 |accessdate = 28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs died in New Haven on April 28, 1903, at the age of 64, the victim of an acute intestinal obstruction.&lt;ref name="Wilson-reminiscences " /&gt; A funeral was conducted two days later at his home on 121&amp;nbsp;High Street,&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; and his body was buried in the nearby [[Grove Street Cemetery]]. In May, Yale organized a memorial meeting at the Sloane Laboratory. The eminent British physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] was in attendance and delivered a brief address.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;197–199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life and character===
[[File:JWGibbs.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Portrait of Willard Gibbs, circa 1895|Photograph taken around 1895. According to his student Lynde Wheeler, of the existing portraits, this is the most faithful to Gibbs's kindly habitual expression.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-portrait"&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;179–180&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Gibbs never married, living all his life in his childhood home with his sister Julia and her husband Addison Van Name, who was the Yale librarian. Except for his customary summer vacations in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondack]]s (at [[Keene Valley, New York]]) and later at the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] (in [[Intervale, New Hampshire]]),&lt;ref name="Seeger-gentleman"&gt;Seeger 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16&lt;/ref&gt; his sojourn in Europe in 1866–69 was almost the only time that Gibbs spent outside New Haven.&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt; He joined Yale's College Church (a [[Congregational church]]) at the end of his freshman year&lt;ref name="Seeger-gentleman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obituary-church"&gt;{{cite book | title = Obituary Record of Graduates of Yale University, 1901–1910 | publisher = Tuttle, Morehouse &amp; Taylor | year = 1910 | location = New Haven | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rVkdAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA238 | page = 238}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained a regular attendant for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-views"&gt;Wheeler, 1998, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs generally voted for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate in presidential elections but, like other "[[Mugwump]]s", his concern over the growing corruption associated with [[Political machine|machine politics]] led him to support [[Grover Cleveland]], a conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], in the [[United States presidential election, 1884|election of 1884]].&lt;ref name="Samuelson-politics"&gt;{{cite book | last = Samuelson | first = Paul A. | authorlink=Paul Samuelson | chapter = Gibbs in Economics | title = Proceedings of the Gibbs Symposium | year = 1990 | page = 255}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Little else is known of his religious or political views, which he mostly kept to himself.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-views" /&gt;

Gibbs did not produce a substantial personal correspondence and many of his letters were later lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;254, 345, 430&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the technical writings concerning his research, he published only two other pieces: a brief obituary for [[Rudolf Clausius]], one of the founders of the mathematical theory of thermodynamics, and a longer biographical memoir of his mentor at Yale, H. A. Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p. 95. See also the ''Collected Works'', vol. II&lt;/ref&gt;  In Edward Bidwell Wilson's view,

{{quote|Gibbs was not an advertiser for personal renown nor a propagandist for science; he was a scholar, scion of an old scholarly family, living before the days when research had become ''ré''search&amp;nbsp;... Gibbs was not a freak, he had no striking ways, he was a kindly dignified gentleman.| E. B. Wilson, 1931&lt;ref name="Wilson-reminiscences " /&gt;}}

According to [[Lynde Wheeler]], who had been Gibbs's student at Yale, in his later years Gibbs

{{quote|was always neatly dressed, usually wore a felt hat on the street, and never exhibited any of the physical mannerisms or eccentricities sometimes thought to be inseparable from genius&amp;nbsp;... His manner was cordial without being effusive and conveyed clearly the innate simplicity and sincerity of his nature.| Lynde Wheeler, 1951&lt;ref name="Wheeler-portrait" /&gt;}}

He was a careful investor and financial manager, and at his death in 1903 his estate was valued at $100,000&lt;ref name="Seeger-gentleman" /&gt; (roughly ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1903|r=-1}}}} today{{Inflation-fn|US}}). For many years, he served as trustee, secretary, and treasurer of his alma mater, the Hopkins School.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-HopkinsSchool"&gt;Wheeler, 1998, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; US President [[Chester A. Arthur]] appointed him as one of the commissioners to the National Conference of Electricians, which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1884, and Gibbs presided over one of its sessions.&lt;ref name="Seeger-gentleman" /&gt; A keen and skilled horseman,&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs was seen habitually in New Haven driving his sister's [[carriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; In an obituary published in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'', Gibbs's former student [[Henry Andrews Bumstead|Henry A. Bumstead]] referred to Gibbs's personal character:

{{quote|Unassuming in manner, genial and kindly in his intercourse with his fellow-men, never showing impatience or irritation, devoid of personal ambition of the baser sort or of the slightest desire to exalt himself, he went far toward realizing the ideal of the unselfish, Christian gentleman. In the minds of those who knew him, the greatness of his intellectual achievements will never overshadow the beauty and dignity of his life.|[[Henry A. Bumstead|H. A. Bumstead]], 1903&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt;}}

=== Chemical thermodynamics ===
[[File:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|thumb|250px|alt=Diagram representing the free energy of a substance|Graphical representation of the free energy of a body, from the latter of the papers published by Gibbs in 1873. This shows a plane of constant volume, passing through the point ''A'' that represents the body's initial state. The curve ''MN'' is the section of the "surface of dissipated energy". ''AD'' and ''AE'' are, respectively, the energy (''ε'') and entropy (''η'') of the initial state. ''AB'' is the "available energy" (now called the [[Helmholtz free energy]]) and ''AC'' the "capacity for entropy" (i.e., the amount by which the entropy can be increased without changing the energy or volume).]]

Gibbs's papers from the 1870s introduced the idea of expressing the internal energy&amp;nbsp;''U'' of a system in terms of the [[entropy]]&amp;nbsp;''S'', in addition to the usual [[state variable|state-variable]]s of volume&amp;nbsp;''V'', pressure&amp;nbsp;''p'', and temperature&amp;nbsp;''T''. He also introduced the concept of the [[chemical potential]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; of a given chemical species, defined to be the rate of the increase in ''U'' associated with the increase in the number ''N'' of molecules of that species (at constant entropy and volume). Thus, it was Gibbs who first combined the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]] by expressing the infinitesimal change in the internal energy, d''U'', of a [[closed system]] in the form:&lt;ref name=Klein1990 /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S - p \,\mathrm{d}V + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d} N_i\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]], ''p'' is the pressure, d''S'' is an infinitesimal change in entropy and d''V'' is an infinitesimal change of volume. The last term is the sum, over all the chemical species in a chemical reaction, of the chemical potential, ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, of the ''i''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; species, multiplied by the infinitesimal change in the number of moles, d''N''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of that species. By taking the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]] of this expression, he defined the concepts of [[enthalpy]], ''H''  and [[Gibbs free energy]], ''G''.
:&lt;math&gt;G_{(p,T)} = H - TS &lt;/math&gt;
This compares to the expression for [[Helmholtz free energy]], ''A''.
:&lt;math&gt;A_{(v,T)} = U-TS\,&lt;/math&gt;

When the Gibbs free energy for a chemical reaction is negative the reaction will proceed spontaneously. When a chemical system is at [[equilibrium chemistry|equilibrium]], the change in Gibbs free energy is zero. An [[equilibrium constant]] is simply related to the free energy change when the reactants are in their [[standard state]]s.
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G^\ominus=-RT \ln K&lt;/math&gt;
[[Chemical potential]] is usually defined as partial molar Gibbs free energy.
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_i=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial N_i}\right)_{T,P,N_{j\neq i}}&lt;/math&gt;

Gibbs also obtained what later came to be known as the "[[Gibbs–Duhem equation]]".&lt;ref name="Ott"/&gt;

The publication of the paper "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances" (1874–78) is now regarded as a landmark in the development of [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; In it, Gibbs developed a rigorous mathematical theory for various [[transport phenomena]], including [[adsorption]], [[electrochemistry]], and the [[Marangoni effect]] in fluid mixtures.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-thermodynamics" /&gt; He also formulated the [[phase rule]]

&lt;math&gt; F\;=\;C\;-\;P\;+\;2 &lt;/math&gt;

for the number ''F'' of [[Intensive and extensive properties|variables]] that may be independently controlled in an equilibrium mixture of ''C'' components existing in ''P'' [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. Phase rule is very useful in diverse areas, such as metallurgy, mineralogy, and petrology. It can also be applied to various research problems in physical chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;79&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistical mechanics ===

Together with James Clerk Maxwell and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], Gibbs founded "statistical mechanics", a term that he coined to identify the branch of theoretical physics that accounts for the observed thermodynamic properties of systems in terms of the statistics of [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensembles]], a collection of many possible states of a system, each assigned a certain probability. He introduced the concept of "[[phase space|phase of a mechanical system]]".&lt;ref name=Nolte2010&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3397041 |title=The tangled tale of phase space |journal=Physics Today |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=33–38 |year=2010 |last1=Nolte |first1=David D. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|For a mechanical system composed of n particles, the phase is represented by a point in a 2n–dimensional space, which he called "extension-in-phase" and is equivalent to our modern notion of phase space. However, the phrase "phase space" was not invented by him.&lt;ref name=Nolte2010/&gt;}} He used the concept to define the [[microcanonical ensemble|microcanonical]], [[canonical ensemble|canonical]], and [[grand canonical ensemble]]s; all related to the [[Gibbs measure]], thus obtaining a more general formulation of the statistical properties of many-particle systems than Maxwell and Boltzmann had achieved before him.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp. 155-159&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Henri Poincaré]], writing in 1904, even though Maxwell and Boltzmann had previously explained the [[Irreversible process|irreversibility]] of macroscopic physical processes in probabilistic terms, "the one who has seen it most clearly, in a book too little read because it is a little difficult to read, is Gibbs, in his ''Elementary Principles of Statistical Mechanics''."&lt;ref name="Poincare"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poincaré |first=Henri |authorlink=Henri Poincaré |year=1904 |chapter=[[s:The Principles of Mathematical Physics|The Principles of Mathematical Physics]]|title=The Foundations of Science (The Value of Science)|pages=297–320|publisher=Science Press|place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs's analysis of irreversibility, and his formulation of Boltzmann's [[H-theorem]] and of the [[ergodic hypothesis]], were major influences on the mathematical physics of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Wightman"&gt;{{cite book | chapter = On the Prescience of J.

Gibbs was well aware that the application of the [[equipartition theorem]] to large systems of classical particles failed to explain the measurements of the [[Heat capacity|specific heats]] of both solids and gases, and he argued that this was evidence of the danger of basing thermodynamics on "hypotheses about the constitution of matter".&lt;ref name=Klein1990/&gt; Gibbs's own framework for statistical mechanics, based on ensembles of macroscopically indistinguishable [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]], could be carried over almost intact after the discovery that the microscopic laws of nature obey quantum rules, rather than the classical laws known to Gibbs and to his contemporaries.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp. 160-161&lt;/ref&gt; His resolution of the so-called "[[Gibbs paradox]]", about the entropy of the mixing of gases, is now often cited as a prefiguration of the [[Identical particles|indistinguishability of particles]] required by quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite book | last = Huang | first = Kerson | authorlink = Kerson Huang | title = Statistical Mechanics | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year = 1987 | edition = 2 | pages = 140–143 | isbn = 978-0-471-81518-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vector analysis ===
[[Image:Cross product parallelogram.svg|alt=Diagram representing the cross product of two vectors|right|thumb|Diagram showing the magnitude and direction of the cross product of two vectors, in the notation introduced by Gibbs]]

British scientists, including Maxwell, had relied on Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s in order to express the dynamics of physical quantities, like the electric and magnetic fields, having both a magnitude and a direction in three-dimensional space. Gibbs, however, noted that the product of quaternions always had to be separated into two parts: a one-dimensional (scalar) quantity and a three-dimensional [[Euclidean vector|vector]], so that the use of quaternions introduced mathematical complications and redundancies that could be avoided in the interest of simplicity and to facilitate teaching. He proposed defining distinct dot and cross products for pairs of vectors and introduced the now common notation for them. He was also largely responsible for the development of the [[vector calculus]] techniques still used today in electrodynamics and fluid mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;107-108, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was working on vector analysis in the late 1870s, Gibbs discovered that his approach was similar to the one that Grassmann had taken in his "multiple algebra".&lt;ref name="Grassmann-algebra"&gt;Letter by Gibbs to [[Victor Schlegel]], quoted in Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;107–109&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbs then sought to publicize Grassmann's work, stressing that it was both more general and historically prior to Hamilton's quaternionic algebra. To establish priority of Grassmann's ideas, Gibbs convinced Grassmann's heirs to seek the publication in Germany of the essay "Theorie der Ebbe und Flut" on [[tide]]s that Grassmann had submitted in 1840 to the faculty at the [[University of Berlin]], in which he had first introduced the notion of what would later be called a [[vector space]] ([[linear space]]).&lt;ref name="Grassmann-tides"&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;113–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacTutor_Grassmann"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Grassmann.html |title=Hermann Günter Grassmann | last1 = O'Connor | first1 = John J. | last2 = Robertson | first2 = Edmund F. | year = 2005 | work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive |publisher=University of St Andrews, Scotland. School of Mathematics and Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Gibbs had advocated in the 1880s and 1890s, quaternions were eventually all but abandoned by physicists in favor of the vectorial approach developed by him and, independently, by [[Oliver Heaviside]]. Gibbs applied his vector methods to the determination of planetary and comet [[orbit]]s.&lt;ref name="Crowe1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael J. Crowe|title=A History of Vector Analysis: The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System|year=1967|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-67910-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|160}} He also developed the concept of mutually reciprocal triads of vectors that later proved to be of importance in [[crystallography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter = Reciprocal Space in Crystallography | last = Shmueli | first = Uri | title = International Tables for Crystallography | volume = B | year = 2006 |pages = 2–9 | chapter-url = http://www.mendeley.com/research/11-reciprocal-space-crystallography/#page-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical optics ===
[[Image:Calcite.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph showing birefrigence by a calcite crystal|A [[calcite]] crystal produces birefringence (or "double refraction") of light, a phenomenon which Gibbs explained using Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic phenomena.]]

Though Gibbs's research on physical optics is less well known today than his other work, it made a significant contribution to classical [[electromagnetism]] by applying [[Maxwell's equations]] to the theory of optical processes such as [[birefringence]], [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], and [[Optical rotation|optical activity]].&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Optics"&gt;Wheeler 1998, ch. VIII&lt;/ref&gt;  In that work, Gibbs showed that those processes could be accounted for by Maxwell's equations without any special assumptions about the microscopic structure of matter or about the nature of the medium in which electromagnetic waves were supposed to propagate (the so-called [[Luminiferous aether|luminiferous ether]]).  Gibbs also stressed that the absence of a [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] electromagnetic wave, which is needed to account for the observed properties of [[light]], is automatically guaranteed by Maxwell's equations (by virtue of what is now called their "[[Gauge fixing|gauge invariance]]"), whereas in mechanical theories of light, such as Lord Kelvin's, it must be imposed as an ''ad hoc'' condition on the properties of the aether.&lt;ref name="Optics" /&gt;

In his last paper on physical optics, Gibbs concluded that

{{quote|it may be said for the electrical theory [of light] that it is not obliged to invent hypotheses, but only to apply the laws furnished by the science of electricity, and that it is difficult to account for the coincidences between the electrical and optical properties of media unless we regard the motions of light as electrical.|J. W. Gibbs, 1889&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt;}}

Shortly afterwards, the electromagnetic nature of light was demonstrated by the experiments of [[Heinrich Hertz]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Hertz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Buchwald | first = Jed Z. | authorlink = Jed Buchwald |title = The Creation of Scientific Effects: Heinrich Hertz and Electric Waves |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 1994 |isbn = 978-0-226-07887-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scientific recognition ==

Gibbs worked at a time when there was little tradition of rigorous theoretical science in the United States. His research was not easily understandable to his students or his colleagues, and he made no effort to popularize his ideas or to simplify their exposition to make them more accessible.&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt; His seminal work on thermodynamics was published mostly in the ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy'', a journal edited by his librarian brother-in-law, which was little read in the USA and even less so in Europe. When Gibbs submitted his long paper on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances to the Academy, both [[Elias Loomis]] and H. A. Newton protested that they did not understand Gibbs's work at all, but they helped to raise the money needed to pay for the typesetting of the many mathematical symbols in the paper. Several Yale faculty members, as well as business and professional men in New Haven, contributed funds for that purpose.&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-printing"&gt;Rukeyser 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;225–226&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though it had been immediately embraced by Maxwell, Gibbs's graphical formulation of the laws of thermodynamics only came into widespread use in the mid 20th century, with the work of [[László Tisza]] and [[Herbert Callen]].&lt;ref&gt;Wightman 1979, pp. xiii, lxxx&lt;/ref&gt; According to James Gerald Crowther,

{{quote|in his later years [Gibbs] was a tall, dignified gentleman, with a healthy stride and ruddy complexion, performing his share of household chores, approachable and kind (if unintelligible) to students. Gibbs was highly esteemed by his friends, but American science was too preoccupied with practical questions to make much use of his profound theoretical work during his lifetime. He lived out his quiet life at Yale, deeply admired by a few able students but making no immediate impress on American science commensurate with his genius.| J. G. Crowther, 1937&lt;ref name="MacTutor" /&gt;}}

[[File:Burlington House ILN 1873.jpg|thumb|alt=Image of Burlington House, London, in 1873|[[Burlington House]], site of the Royal Society of London, in 1873]]

On the other hand, Gibbs did receive the major honors then possible for an academic scientist in the US. He was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1879 and received the 1880 [[Rumford Prize]] from the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] for his work on chemical thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Müller | first = Ingo | title = A History of Thermodynamics - the Doctrine of Energy and Entropy | publisher = Springer | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-46226-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded honorary doctorates by Princeton University and [[Williams College]].&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt;

In Europe, Gibbs was inducted as honorary member of the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1892 and elected [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1897|Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1897]].&lt;ref name=formemrs&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316060617/https://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows/|archivedate=2015-03-16|url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows/|publisher=Royal Society|location=London|title=Fellows of the Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Prussian]] and [[French Academy of Sciences|French]] Academies of Science and received honorary doctorates from the universities of [[University of Dublin|Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=2 June 1902 |page_number=9 |issue=36783| }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], and [[University of Oslo|Christiania]]&lt;ref name="Bumstead" /&gt; (now Oslo). The Royal Society further honored Gibbs in 1901 with the [[Copley Medal]], then regarded as the highest international award in the natural sciences,&lt;ref name="APS" /&gt; noting that he had been "the first to apply the second law of thermodynamics to the exhaustive discussion of the relation between chemical, electrical and thermal energy and capacity for external work."&lt;ref name="Britannica-1911" /&gt; Gibbs, who remained in New Haven, was represented at the award ceremony by Commander [[Richardson Clover]], the US naval attaché in London.&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1998, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, mathematician [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] tells of casually browsing the mathematical stacks of [[Sterling Library]] and stumbling on a handwritten mailing list, attached to some of Gibbs's course notes, which listed over two hundred notable scientists of his day, including Poincaré, Boltzmann, [[David Hilbert]], and [[Ernst Mach]]. From this, Rota concluded that Gibbs's work was better known among the scientific elite of his day than the published material suggests.&lt;ref name="Rota"&gt;{{cite book | last = Rota | first = Gian-Carlo | authorlink=Gian-Carlo Rota | title = Indiscrete Thoughts | publisher = Birkhäuser | year = 1996 | page = 25 |isbn = 978-0-8176-3866-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynde Wheeler reproduces that mailing list in an appendix to his biography of Gibbs.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-mailing"&gt;Wheeler 1998, appendix IV&lt;/ref&gt; That Gibbs succeeded in interesting his European correspondents in his work is demonstrated by the fact that his monograph "On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances" was translated into German (then the leading language for chemistry) by [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in 1892 and into French by [[Henri Louis Le Châtelier]] in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;102–104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Gibbs's most immediate and obvious influence was on physical chemistry and statistical mechanics, two disciplines which he greatly helped to found. During Gibbs's lifetime, his phase rule was experimentally validated by Dutch chemist [[Hendrik Willem Bakhuis Roozeboom|H. W. Bakhuis Roozeboom]], who showed how to apply it in a variety of situations, thereby assuring it of widespread use.&lt;ref name="Roozeboom"&gt;{{cite book | last=Crowther | first=James Gerald | chapter=Josiah Willard Gibbs, 1839–1903 | title=Famous American Men of Science | publisher=Books for Libraries | location=Freeport, NY | year=1969 |origyear=1937 | pages=277–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In industrial chemistry, Gibbs's thermodynamics found many applications during the early 20th century, from electrochemistry to the development of the [[Haber process]] for the synthesis of [[ammonia]].&lt;ref name="Haber"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0016-0032(25)90344-4 |title=Practical results of the theoretical development of chemistry |journal=Journal of the Franklin Institute |volume=199 |issue=4 |pages=437–456 |year=1925 |last1=Haber |first1=F. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Dutch physicist [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|J. D. van der Waals]] received the 1910 [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] "for his work on the [[equation of state]] for gases and liquids" he acknowledged the great influence of Gibbs's work on that subject.&lt;ref name="vanderWaals"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1910/waals-lecture.html | title = Nobel Lecture: The Equation of State for Gases and Liquids | last =van der Waals | first = J. D. | authorlink = Johannes Diderik van der Waals | year= 1910 |work= Nobel Prize in Physics |publisher = Nobel Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Max Planck]] received the 1918 Nobel Prize for his work on quantum mechanics, particularly his 1900 paper on [[Planck's law]] for quantized [[black-body radiation]]. That work was based largely on the thermodynamics of Kirchhoff, Boltzmann, and Gibbs. Planck declared that Gibbs's name "not only in America but in the whole world will ever be reckoned among the most renowned theoretical physicists of all times."&lt;ref name="Planck"&gt;{{cite book | last=Planck | first=Max  |authorlink=Max Planck | title=Eight Lectures on Theoretical Physics | chapter=Second Lecture: Thermodynamic States of Equilibrium in Dilute Solutions | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York | year=1915 | page=21 | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53DnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gibbs-Elementary principles in statistical mechanics.png|thumb|upright|alt=Title page of Gibbs's ''Statistical Mechanics''|Title page of Gibbs's ''[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics]]'', one of the founding documents of that discipline, published in 1902]]

The first half of the 20th century saw the publication of two influential textbooks that soon came to be regarded as founding documents of [[chemical thermodynamics]], both of which used and extended Gibbs's work in that field: these were ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Processes'' (1923), by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]], and ''Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs'' (1933), by [[Edward A. Guggenheim]].&lt;ref name="Ott"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Ott |first1 = Bevan J.  |last2 = Boerio-Goates |first2 = Juliana |title = Chemical Thermodynamics – Principles and Applications |publisher = Academic Press |year = 2000 |pages = 1, 213–214|isbn = 978-0-12-530990-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs's work on statistical ensembles, as presented in his 1902 textbook, has had a great impact in both theoretical physics and in pure mathematics.&lt;ref name="Wightman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiener" /&gt; According to mathematical physicist [[Arthur Wightman]],

{{quote|It is one of the striking features of the work of Gibbs, noticed by every student of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, that his formulations of physical concepts were so felicitously chosen that they have survived 100 years of turbulent development in theoretical physics and mathematics.| A. S. Wightman, 1990&lt;ref name="Wightman" /&gt;}}

Initially unaware of Gibbs's contributions in that field, [[Albert Einstein]] wrote three papers on statistical mechanics, published between 1902 and 1904.  After reading Gibbs's textbook (which was translated into German by [[Ernst Zermelo]] in 1905), Einstein declared that Gibbs's treatment was superior to his own and explained that he would not have written those papers if he had known Gibbs's work.&lt;ref name="Navarro-Einstein"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s004070050025 |title=Gibbs, Einstein and the Foundations of Statistical Mechanics |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |volume=53 |issue=2 |pages=147–180 |year=1998 |last1=Navarro |first1=Luis }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs's early papers on the use of graphical methods in thermodynamics reflect a powerfully original understanding of what mathematicians would later call "[[convex analysis]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wightman 1979, pp.&amp;nbsp;x–xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; including ideas that, according to [[Barry Simon]], "lay dormant for about seventy-five years".&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book | last = Simon | first = Barry | authorlink = Barry Simon | title = Convexity: An Analytic Viewpoint | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2011 | page = 287 | isbn = 978-1-107-00731-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Important mathematical concepts based on Gibbs's work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics include the [[Gibbs lemma]] in [[game theory]], the [[Gibbs' inequality|Gibbs inequality]] in [[information theory]], as well as [[Gibbs sampling]] in [[computational statistics]].

The development of vector calculus was Gibbs's other great contribution to mathematics. The publication in 1901 of E. B. Wilson's textbook ''[[Vector Analysis]]'', based on Gibbs's lectures at Yale, did much to propagate the use of vectorial methods and notation in both mathematics and theoretical physics, definitively displacing the quaternions that had until then been dominant in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Marsden"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marsden | first1 = Jerrold E. | authorlink1= Jerrold E.

At Yale, Gibbs was also mentor to Lee De Forest, who went on to invent the [[triode]] amplifier and has been called the "father of radio".&lt;ref name="Seeger-DeForest"&gt;Seeger 1974, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; De Forest credited Gibbs's influence for the realization "that the leaders in electrical development would be those who pursued the [[Electromagnetic radiation|higher theory of waves]] and oscillations and the transmission by these means of intelligence and power."&lt;ref name="DeForest" /&gt; Another student of Gibbs who played a significant role in the development of radio technology was Lynde Wheeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/1831364b0 |title=Dr. Lynde P. Wheeler |journal=Nature |volume=183 |issue=4672 |pages=1364 |year=1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibbs also had an indirect influence on mathematical economics. He supervised the thesis of [[Irving Fisher]], who received the first Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1891. In that work, published in 1892 as ''Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices'', Fisher drew a direct analogy between Gibbsian equilibrium in physical and chemical systems, and the [[General equilibrium theory|general equilibrium]] of markets, and he used Gibbs's vectorial notation.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Celebrating-Fisher"/&gt;  Gibbs's protegé Edwin Bidwell Wilson became, in turn, a mentor to leading American economist and Nobel Laureate [[Paul Samuelson]].&lt;ref name="Samuelson-lecture"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1970/samuelson-lecture.pdf | title = Maximum Principles in Analytical Economics | last = Samuelson | first = Paul A. | year = 1970 | work = Nobel Prize Lecture | publisher = Nobel Foundation | access-date = 2010-09-26 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121011025043/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/1970/samuelson-lecture.pdf | archive-date = 2012-10-11 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Samuelson published ''[[Foundations of Economic Analysis]]'', based on his doctoral dissertation, in which he used as [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] a remark attributed to Gibbs: "Mathematics is a language."

Mathematician [[Norbert Wiener]] cited Gibbs's use of probability in the formulation of statistical mechanics as "the first great revolution of twentieth century physics" and as a major influence on his conception of [[cybernetics]]. Wiener explained in the preface to his book ''[[The Human Use of Human Beings]]'' that it was "devoted to the impact of the Gibbsian point of view on modern life, both through the substantive changes it has made to working science, and through the changes it has made indirectly in our attitude to life in general."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wiener | first = Norbert | title =The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society | publisher = Houghton Mifflin| year = 1950 | pages = 10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the German physical chemist [[Walther Nernst]] visited Yale in 1906 to give the [[Silliman Memorial Lectures|Silliman lecture]], he was surprised to find no tangible memorial for Gibbs. Nernst donated his $500 lecture fee to the university to help pay for a suitable monument.

In 1945, Yale University created the J. Willard Gibbs Professorship in Theoretical Chemistry, held until 1973 by [[Lars Onsager]].

Edward Guggenheim introduced the symbol ''G'' for the Gibbs free energy in 1933, and this was used also by [[Dirk ter Haar]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Seeger 1974, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This notation is now universal and is recommended by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]].&lt;ref name="IUPAC-G"&gt;{{Cite book| doi = 10.1351/goldbook.G02629 | chapter = Gibbs energy (function), G | title = IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-9678550-9-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, William Giauque and others suggested the name "gibbs" (abbreviated gbs.) for the unit of entropy [[calorie]] per [[kelvin]],&lt;ref name="Giauque-unit"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ja01486a014 |title=The Thermodynamic Properties of Aqueous Sulfuric Acid Solutions and Hydrates from 15 to 300°K.1 |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=82 |pages=62–70 |year=1960 |last1=Giauque |first1=W.

In 1954, a year before his death, Albert Einstein was asked by an interviewer who were the greatest thinkers that he had known. Einstein replied: "[[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]]", adding "I never met Willard Gibbs; perhaps, had I done so, I might have placed him beside Lorentz."&lt;ref name="Pais"&gt;{{cite book |title=Subtle is the Lord |last=Pais |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Pais |year=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |page = 73|isbn= 978-0-19-280672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In literature===
In 1909, the American historian and novelist [[Henry Adams]] finished an essay entitled "The Rule of Phase Applied to History", in which he sought to apply Gibbs's phase rule and other thermodynamic concepts to a general theory of human history. [[William James]], Henry Bumstead, and others criticized both Adams's tenuous grasp of the scientific concepts that he invoked, as well as the arbitrariness of his application of those concepts as metaphors for the evolution of human thought and society.&lt;ref name="Mindel-Adams"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2708401 |jstor=2708401 |title=The Uses of Metaphor: Henry Adams and the Symbols of Science |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=26 |pages=89 |year=1965 |last1=Mindel |first1=Joseph }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The essay remained unpublished until it appeared posthumously in 1919, in ''The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma'', edited by Henry Adams's younger brother [[Brooks Adams|Brooks]].&lt;ref name="Degradation"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Degradation of the Democratic Dogma |last=Adams |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Adams |editor-last = Adams |editor-first = Brooks |year=1919 |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/thedegradationof00adamuoft |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, feminist poet [[Muriel Rukeyser]] became fascinated by Willard Gibbs and wrote a long poem about his life and work ("Gibbs", included in the collection ''A Turning Wind'', published in 1939), as well as a book-length biography (''Willard Gibbs'', 1942).&lt;ref name="Gander-Lives"&gt;{{cite book |title=Muriel Rukeyser and Documentary: The Poetics of Connection |last=Gander |first=Catherine |chapter=The Lives |year=2013 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |pages=73–120 |isbn= 978-0-7486-7053-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Rukeyser:

{{quote|Willard Gibbs is the type of the imagination at work in the world. His story is that of an opening up which has had its effect on our lives and our thinking; and, it seems to me, it is the emblem of the naked imagination&amp;mdash;which is called abstract and impractical, but whose discoveries can be used by anyone who is interested, in whatever "field"&amp;mdash;an imagination which for me, more than that of any other figure in American thought, any poet, or political, or religious figure, stands for imagination at its essential points.| Muriel Rukeyser, 1949&lt;ref name="Rukeyser-PT"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3066422 |title=Josiah Willard Gibbs |journal=Physics Today |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=6–27 |year=1949 |last1=Rukeyser |first1=Muriel }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1946, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine illustrated a cover story on "Fundamental Science" with a representation of the [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|thermodynamic surface]] that Maxwell had built based on Gibbs's proposal. Rukeyser called this surface a "statue of water"&lt;ref&gt;Rukeyser 1988, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; and the magazine saw in it "the abstract creation of a great American scientist that lends itself to the symbolism of contemporary art forms."&lt;ref name="Fortune"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1946 |title=The Great Science Debate |journal=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |volume=33 |issue=6 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork by Arthur Lidov also included Gibbs's mathematical expression of the phase rule for heterogeneous mixtures, as well as a [[radar]] screen, an [[oscilloscope]] waveform, [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] apple, and a small rendition of a three-dimensional phase diagram.&lt;ref name="Fortune" /&gt;

Gibbs's nephew, Ralph Gibbs Van Name, a professor of physical chemistry at Yale, was unhappy with Rukeyser's biography, in part because of her lack of scientific training. Van Name had withheld the family papers from her and, after her book was published in 1942 to positive literary but mixed scientific reviews, he tried to encourage Gibbs's former students to produce a more technically oriented biography.&lt;ref name="family-papers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=beinecke:gibbs&amp;query=&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes&amp;hlon=yes&amp;big=&amp;adv=&amp;filter=&amp;hitPageStart=&amp;sortFields=&amp;view=all |title=Guide to the Gibbs-Van Name Papers |last = Holeman | first = Heather L. |year = 1986 | publisher=Yale University Library |accessdate = 2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rukeyser's approach to Gibbs was also sharply criticized by Gibbs's former student and protégé Edwin Wilson.&lt;ref name="Wilson-rev1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.99.2576.386 |pmid=17844056 |title=Starring Subjects in "american Men of Science" |journal=Science |volume=99 |issue=2576 |pages=386 |year=1944 |last1=Miller |first1=G. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Van Name's and Wilson's encouragement, physicist Lynde Wheeler published a new biography of Gibbs in 1951.&lt;ref name="Wheeler-preface"&gt;Wheeler 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;ix–xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson-rev2"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Edwin B. | year = 1951 | title = Josiah Willard Gibbs | journal = American Scientist | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 287–289 | jstor = 27826371 | doi =  | url =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Gibbs and Rukeyser's biography of him figure prominently in the poetry collection ''True North'' (1997) by [[Stephanie Strickland]].&lt;ref name="Strickland"&gt;{{cite book |title=True North |last=Strickland |first=Stephanie |authorlink=Stephanie Strickland |year=1997 |publisher=University of Notre Dame Press |location=Notre Dame, IN |isbn= 978-0-268-01899-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fiction, Gibbs appears as the mentor to character Kit Traverse in [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s novel ''[[Against the Day]]'' (2006). That novel also prominently discusses the birefringence of [[Iceland spar]], an optical phenomenon that Gibbs investigated.&lt;ref name="Pynchon"&gt;{{cite book |title=Against the Day |last=Pynchon |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Pynchon |year=2006 |publisher=Penguin |location=New York |isbn= 978-1-59420-120-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gibbs stamp (2005)===

In 2005, the [[United States Postal Service]] issued the ''American Scientists'' commemorative [[postage stamp]] series designed by artist [[Victor Stabin]], depicting Gibbs, [[John von Neumann]], [[Barbara McClintock]], and [[Richard Feynman]]. The [[first day of issue]] ceremony for the series was held on May 4 at Yale University's Luce Hall and was attended by [[John Marburger]], scientific advisor to the President of the United States, [[Rick Levin]], president of Yale, and family members of the scientists honored, including physician John W. Gibbs, a distant cousin of Willard Gibbs.&lt;ref name="stamp-issue"&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale scientist featured in new stamp series |url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v33.n29/story3.html |newspaper=Yale Bulletin &amp; Calendar |date=20 May 2005 |volume=33 |number=28 |accessdate=30 Nov 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030122112/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v33.n29/story3.html |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=Dans la seconde partie de mon rapport, il s'agit des variétés kählériennes dites K3, ainsi nommées en l'honneur de [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]], [[Erich Kähler|Kähler]], [[Kunihiko Kodaira|Kodaira]] et de la belle montagne K2 au Cachemire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
''In the second part of my report, we deal with the Kähler varieties known as K3, named in honor of [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]], [[Erich Kähler|Kähler]], [[Kunihiko Kodaira|Kodaira]] and of the beautiful mountain [[K2]] in Kashmir.''
|source=André {{harvtxt|Weil|1958|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;546}}, describing the reason for the name "K3 surface"
|width=30%}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''K3 surface''' is a complex or algebraic smooth minimal complete surface that is [[irregularity of a surface|regular]] and has trivial [[canonical bundle]].

In the [[Enriques–Kodaira classification]] of surfaces they form one of the four classes of surfaces of [[Kodaira dimension]]&amp;nbsp;0.

Together with two-dimensional [[complex tori]], they are the [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]s of dimension two. Most complex K3 surfaces are not algebraic. This means that they cannot be embedded in any projective space as a surface defined by polynomial equations.

==Definition==
There are many equivalent properties that can be used to characterize a '''K3 surface'''. The only complete smooth surfaces with trivial canonical bundle are K3 surfaces and tori (or abelian varieties), so one can add any condition to exclude the latter to define K3 surfaces. Over the complex numbers the condition that the surface is simply connected is sometimes used.

There are a few variations of the definition: some authors restrict to projective surfaces, and some allow surfaces with [[Du Val singularities]].

==Calculation of the Betti numbers==
Equivalently to the above definition, a K3 surface is defined as a surface ''S'' with trivial [[canonical bundle]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and [[irregularity of a surface|irregularity]] ''q''(''S'') = 0. One has

:&lt;math&gt;0 = q(S) = h^{0,1}(S) = \dim H^1(S,\mathcal{O}_S)&lt;/math&gt; 

and, from [[Serre duality]],

:&lt;math&gt;h^2(S,\mathcal{O}_S)=h^0(S,K_S)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Altogether, one obtains the [[Euler characteristic]]

:&lt;math&gt;\chi(S,\mathcal{O}_S):=\sum_i (-1)^i h^i(S,\mathcal{O}_S)=2.&lt;/math&gt;
On the other hand, the [[Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces|Riemann–Roch theorem]] (Noether's formula) reads

where ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') is the ''i''-th [[Chern class]]. Since ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; is trivial, its first Chern class ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'') vanishes, hence ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;24.

==Properties==
'''1.''' All complex K3 surfaces are [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to one another (proved by Kunihiko Kodaira firstly). {{harvtxt|Siu|1983}} showed that all complex K3 surfaces are [[Kähler manifold]]s. As a consequence of this and Yau's solution to the [[Calabi conjecture]], all complex K3 surfaces admit [[Ricci-flat]] metrics.

'''2.''' The (''p,q'')-th cohomology groups are indicated in the [[Hodge diamond]]
{{Hodge diamond|style=font-weight:bold
| 1
| 0 | 0
| 1 | 20 | 1
| 0 | 0

}}

'''3.''' On &lt;math&gt;H^2(S,\mathbb{Z})&lt;/math&gt;, the cup product defines a lattice structure, called the '''K3 lattice''', as described in the next section.

Because of the above properties, K3 surfaces have been studied extensively not only in algebraic geometry but also in [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s, [[mirror symmetry　(string theory)|mirror symmetry]] and [[string theory]]. In particular, the lattice structure provides the modularity with the [[Néron–Severi group]] on it.

==The period map==
There is a [[coarse moduli space]] for marked complex K3 surfaces, a non-Hausdorff smooth analytic space of complex dimension 20. There is a [[period mapping]] and the [[Torelli theorem]] holds for complex K3 surfaces.

The set ''M'' of pairs consisting of a complex K3 surface ''S'' and a Kähler class of H&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;(''S'','''R''') is in a natural way a real analytic manifold of dimension 60. There is a refined period map from ''M'' to a space KΩ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; that is an isomorphism. The space of periods can be described explicitly as follows:

*''L'' is the even [[unimodular lattice]] II&lt;sub&gt;3,19&lt;/sub&gt;.
*Ω is the [[Hermitian symmetric space]] consisting of the  elements  of the complex projective space of ''L''⊗'''C''' that are represented by elements ω with (ω,ω)=0, (ω,ω^*)&gt;0.
*KΩ is the set of pairs (κ, [ω]) in (''L''⊗'''R''', Ω) with (κ,E(ω))=0, (κ,κ)&gt;0.
*KΩ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of elements  (κ, [ω]) of KΩ such that (κ''d'') ≠ 0 for every ''d'' in ''L'' with (''d'',''d'')=&amp;minus;2, (ω,''d'')=0.

==Projective K3 surfaces==
If ''L'' is a line bundle on a K3 surface, the curves in the linear system have genus ''g'', where
''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''L'') =2''g''-2. A K3 surface with a line bundle  ''L'' like this is called a   K3 surface of genus ''g''. A K3 surface may have many different line bundles making it into a K3 surface of genus ''g'' for many different values of ''g''. The space of sections of the line bundle has dimension ''g''+1, so there is a morphism of the K3 surface to projective space of dimension ''g''. There is a moduli space ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; of K3 surfaces with a primitive ample line bundle ''L'' with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''L'') =2''g''-2, which is nonempty of dimension 19 for ''g''≥ 2. {{harvtxt|Mukai|2006}} showed that this moduli space ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; is unirational if  ''g''≤13, and {{harvs | txt| last1=Gritsenko | first1=V. A. | last2=Hulek | first2=Klaus | last3=Sankaran | first3=G. K. | title=The Kodaira dimension of the moduli of K3 surfaces | doi=10.1007/s00222-007-0054-1 | mr=2336040 | year=2007 | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]]   | volume=169 | issue=3 | pages=519–567}} showed that it is of [[surface of general type|general type]] if ''g''≥63. {{harvtxt|Voisin|2008}} gave a survey of this area.

==Relation to string duality==
K3 surfaces appear almost ubiquitously in [[string duality]] and provide an important tool for the understanding of it. [[Compactification (physics)#Compactification in string theory|String compactifications]] on these surfaces are not trivial, yet they are simple enough for us to analyze most of their properties in detail. The type IIA string, the type IIB string, the E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;×E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; heterotic string, the Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string, and M-theory are related by compactification on a K3 surface. For example, the Type IIA compactified on a K3 surface is equivalent to the heterotic string compactified on 4-torus {{harvtxt|Aspinwall|1996}}.

==Examples==
*A [[Double cover (topology)|double cover]] of the [[projective plane]] branched along a [[non-singular]] degree 6 curve is a genus 2 K3 surface.
*A [[Kummer surface]] is the quotient of a two-dimensional [[abelian variety]] ''A'' by the action ''a'' → &amp;minus;''a''. This results in 16 singularities, at the 2-torsion points of ''A''. The [[Resolution of singularities|minimal resolution]] of this quotient is a genus 3 K3 surface.
*A [[non-singular]] degree 4 surface in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is a genus 3 K3 surface.
*The intersection of a [[quadric]] and a cubic in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; gives genus 4 K3 surfaces.
*The intersection of three [[quadric]]s in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; gives genus 5 K3 surfaces.
*{{harvtxt|Brown|2007}} describes a computer database of K3 surfaces.

==History==
K3 surface was first discovered by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan|Ramanujan]] in 1910s but remained unpublished,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ono|Trebat-Leder|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ono|Trebat-Leder|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was rediscovered by André {{harvtxt|Weil|1958}} who named them in honor of three algebraic geometers, [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]], [[Erich Kähler|Kähler]] and [[Kunihiko Kodaira|Kodaira]], and  the mountain [[K2]] in Pakistan.

'''Lars Valerian Ahlfors''' (18 April 1907 – 11 October 1996) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[mathematician]], remembered for his work in the field of [[Riemann surface]]s and his text on [[complex analysis]].

==Background==
Ahlfors was born in [[Helsinki, Finland]]. His mother, Sievä Helander, died at his birth. His father, Axel Ahlfors, was a professor of engineering at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. The Ahlfors family was [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]], so he first attended a private school where all classes were taught in Swedish. Ahlfors studied at [[University of Helsinki]] from 1924, graduating in 1928 having studied under [[Ernst Lindelöf]] and [[Rolf Nevanlinna]]. He assisted Nevanlinna in 1929 with his work on [[Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem|Denjoy's conjecture]] on the number of asymptotic values of an [[entire function]].
In 1929 Ahlfors published the first proof of this conjecture, now known as the Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem. It states that the number of asymptotic values approached by an entire function of order ρ along curves in the [[complex plane]] going toward infinity is less than or equal to 2ρ.

He completed his doctorate from the University of Helsinki in 1930.

==Career==
Ahlfors worked as an associate professor at the [[University of Helsinki]] from 1933 to 1936. In 1936 he was one of the first two people to be awarded the [[Fields Medal]]. In 1935 Ahlfors visited [[Harvard University]]. He returned to [[Finland]] in 1938 to take up a professorship at the University of Helsinki. The outbreak of war led to problems although Ahlfors was unfit for military service. He was offered a post at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich]] in 1944 and finally managed to travel there in March 1945. He did not enjoy his time in [[Switzerland]], so in 1946 he jumped at a chance to leave, returning to work at Harvard where he remained until he retired in 1977; he was William Caspar Graustein Professor of Mathematics from 1964. Ahlfors was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1962 and again in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/ Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars]&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the Wihuri Prize in 1968 and the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] in 1981.

His book ''Complex Analysis'' (1953) is the classic text on the subject and is almost certainly referenced in any more recent text which makes heavy use of complex analysis. Ahlfors wrote several other significant books, including ''Riemann surfaces'' (1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Springer, George|authorlink=George Springer (mathematician)|title=Review of ''Riemann surfaces''. By Lars V. Ahlfors and Leo Sario|journal=Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.|volume=67|issue=2|pages=170–171|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1961-67-02/S0002-9904-1961-10548-X/S0002-9904-1961-10548-X.pdf|doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1961-10548-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Conformal invariants'' (1973).
He made decisive contributions to [[meromorphic]] curves, [[value distribution theory]], [[Riemann surface]]s, [[conformal geometry]], [[quasiconformal mapping]]s and other areas during his career.

==Personal life==
In 1933, he married Erna Lehnert, an [[Austrians|Austrian]] who with her parents had first settled in [[Sweden]] and then in [[Finland]]. The couple had three daughters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6642">In [[mathematics]], in [[combinatorics]], '''Li Shanlan identity''' (also called '''Li Shanlan's summation formula''') is a certain [[combinatorial]] [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] attributed to the nineteenth century [[Chinese mathematics|Chinese mathematician]] [[Li Shanlan]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jean-Claude Martzloff|title=A History of Chinese Mathematics|date=1997|publisher=Springer Verlag|location=Heidelberg Berlin|isbn=9783540337829|pages=342–343}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Li Shanlan is also known as Li Renshu, this identity is also referred to as '''Li Renshu identity'''.&lt;ref name=MI/&gt; This identity appears in the third chapter of ''Duoji bilei'' (Summing finite series), a mathematical text authored by Li Shanlan and published in 1867 as part of his collected works. A [[Czech Republic|Czech]] mathematician Josef Kaucky published an elementary proof of the identity along with a history of the identity in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josef Kaucky|title=Une nouvelle demonstration elementaire de la formula combinatoire de Li Jen Shu|journal=M.-Fuzik. Cas..|date=1965|volume=15|pages=206–214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaucky attributed the identity to a certain Li Jen-Shu. From the account of the history of the identity, it has been ascertained that Li Jen-Shu is in fact Li Shanlan.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Western scholars had been studying Chinese mathematics for its historical value; but the attribution of this identity to a nineteenth century Chinese mathematician sparked a rethink on the mathematical value of the writings of Chinese mathematicians.&lt;ref name=MI&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karen V. H. Parshall, Jean-Claude Martzloff|title=Li Shanlan (1811–1882) and Chinese Traditional Mathematics|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|date=September 1992|volume=14|issue=4|pages=32–37|doi=10.1007/bf03024470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In the West Li is best remembered for a combinatoric formula, known as the “Li Renshu identity,” that he derived using only traditional Chinese mathematical methods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wann-Sheng Horng|title=Li Shanlan  Chinese mathematician|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Li-Shanlan|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The identity==
The Li Shanlan identity states that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^p {p \choose k}^2 {{n+2p-k}\choose {2p}} = {{n+p} \choose p}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Li Shanlan did not present the identity in this way. He presented it in the traditional Chinese algorithmic and rhetorical way.

==Proofs of the identity==
Li Shanlan had not given a proof of the identity in ''Duoji bilei''. The first proof using differential equations and Legendre polynomials, concepts foreign to Shanlan, was published by Turan in Chinese in 1936.&lt;ref name=MI/&gt; Since then at least fifteen  different proofs have been found.&lt;ref name=MI/&gt; The following is one of the simplest proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=John Riordan|title=Combinatorial Identities|date=1979|publisher=Robert E Krieger Publishing Company|location=New York|isbn=0882758292|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof begins by expressing &lt;math&gt;n \choose q&lt;/math&gt; as [[Vandermonde's convolution]]:
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose q } = \sum_{k=0}^q {{n-p} \choose k}{p \choose {q-k}} &lt;/math&gt;
Pre-multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt; n\choose p &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose p}{n \choose q} = \sum_{k=0}^q {n \choose p} {{n-p} \choose k}{p \choose {q-k}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Using the following relation
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose p} {{n-p} \choose k} = {{p+k} \choose k}{n \choose {p+k}}&lt;/math&gt;
the above relation can be transformed to
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose p}{n \choose q} = \sum_{k=0}^q {p \choose {q-k}} {{p+k} \choose k}{n \choose {p+k}}&lt;/math&gt;.
Next the relation
:&lt;math&gt;{p \choose {q-k}} {{p+k} \choose {k}} = {q \choose k}{{p+k}\choose {q}}&lt;/math&gt;
is used to get
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose p}{n \choose q} = \sum_{k=0}^q {q \choose k}{n \choose {p+k}}{ {p+k}\choose q}&lt;/math&gt;.

Another application of Vandermonde's convolution yields
:&lt;math&gt;{ {p+k}\choose q} =  \sum_{j=0}^q {p \choose j}{k \choose {q-j}}&lt;/math&gt;
and hence
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose p}{n \choose q} = \sum_{k=0}^q {q \choose k}{n \choose {p+k}} \sum_{j=0}^q {p \choose j}{k \choose {q-j}}&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;p \choose j&lt;/math&gt; is independent of ''k'', this can be put in the form
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose p}{n \choose q} = \sum_{j=0}^q {p \choose j}\sum_{k=0}^q {q \choose k}{n \choose {p+k}}{k \choose {q-j}}&lt;/math&gt;

Next,  the result
:&lt;math&gt; {q \choose k}{k \choose {q-j}} = {q\choose j}{j \choose{q-k}}&lt;/math&gt;
gives
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose p}{n \choose q} = \sum_{j=0}^q {p \choose j}\sum_{k=0}^q {q \choose j}{j \choose {q-k}}{n \choose {p+k}}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{j=0}^q {p \choose j}{q \choose j}\sum_{k=0}^q {j \choose {q-k}}{n \choose {p+k}}&lt;/math&gt;
::::&lt;math&gt; = \sum_{j=0}^q {p \choose j}{q \choose j}{{n+j}\choose {p+q}}&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''p'' = ''q'' and replacing ''j'' by ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose p}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^p {p \choose k}^2{{n+k}\choose {2p}}&lt;/math&gt;

Li's identity follows from this by replacing ''n'' by ''n'' + ''p'' and doing some rearrangement of terms in the resulting expression:
:&lt;math&gt;{{n+p} \choose p}^2 = \sum_{k=0}^p {p \choose k}^2{{n+2p-k}\choose {2p}}&lt;/math&gt;

==On ''Duoji bilei''==
The term ''duoji'' denotes a certain traditional Chinese method of  computing sums of piles. Most of the mathematics that was developed in China since the sixteenth century is related to the ''duoji'' method. Li Shanlan was one of the greatest exponents of this method and ''Duoji belei'' is an exposition of his work related to this method. ''Duoji bilei'' consists of four chapters: Chapter 1 deals with triangular piles, Chapter 2 with finite power series, Chapter 3 with triangular self-multiplying piles and Chapter 4 with modified triangular piles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tian Miao|title=The Westernization of Chinese mathematics: The case study of the ''Duoji'' method and its development|journal=East Asian Science, Technology, and Medicine|date=2003|volume=20|pages=45–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finite spherical symmetry groups are also called [[point groups in three dimensions]]. There are five fundamental symmetry classes which have triangular fundamental domains: [[Dihedral symmetry|dihedral]], [[Cyclic symmetry|cyclic]], [[tetrahedral symmetry|tetrahedral]], [[octahedral symmetry|octahedral]], and [[icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral]] symmetry.

This article lists the groups by [[Schoenflies notation]], [[Coxeter notation]],&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; [[orbifold notation]],&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and order. [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] uses a variation of the Schoenflies notation, based on the groups' [[quaternion]] algebraic structure, labeled by one or two upper case letters, and whole number subscripts. The group order is defined as the subscript, unless the order is doubled for symbols with a plus or minus, "±", prefix, which implies a [[central inversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Conway, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hermann–Mauguin notation]] (International notation) is also given. The [[crystallography]] groups, 32 in total, are a subset with element orders 2, 3, 4 and 6.&lt;ref&gt;Sands, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involutional symmetry ==

There are four [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]al groups: no symmetry (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[reflection symmetry]] (C&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;), 2-fold rotational symmetry (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and central [[point symmetry]] (C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25526">In [[information theory]], a '''low-density parity-check''' ('''LDPC''') '''code''' is a [[Linear code|linear]] [[error correcting code]], a method of transmitting a message over a [[signal noise|noisy]] transmission channel.&lt;ref&gt;[[David J.C. MacKay]] (2003) Information theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms, CUP, {{ISBN|0-521-64298-1}}, (also [http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/itila/book.html available online])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Todd K. Moon]] (2005) Error Correction Coding, Mathematical Methods and Algorithms. Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-64800-0}} (Includes code)&lt;/ref&gt; An LDPC is constructed using a sparse [[bipartite graph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Amin Shokrollahi]] (2003) LDPC Codes: An Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; LDPC codes are [[:Category:capacity-approaching codes|capacity-approaching codes]], which means that practical constructions exist that allow the noise threshold to be set very close (or even ''arbitrarily'' close on the [[binary erasure channel]]) to the theoretical maximum (the [[Shannon-Hartley theorem|Shannon limit]]) for a symmetric memoryless channel. The noise threshold defines an upper bound for the channel noise, up to which the probability of lost information can be made as small as desired. Using iterative [[belief propagation]] techniques, LDPC codes can be decoded in time linear to their block length.

LDPC codes are finding increasing use in applications requiring reliable and highly efficient information transfer over bandwidth-constrained or return-channel-constrained links in the presence of corrupting noise. Implementation of LDPC codes has lagged behind that of other codes, notably [[turbo code]]s. The fundamental patent for Turbo Codes expired on August 29, 2013.[https://www.google.com/patents/US5446747 [US5446747&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;ref&gt;NewScientist, ''Communication speed nears terminal velocity'', by Dana Mackenzie, 9 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

LDPC codes are also known as '''Gallager codes''', in honor of [[Robert G. Gallager]], who developed the LDPC concept in his doctoral dissertation at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/gallager-codes-0121.html |title=Explained: Gallager codes |author=Larry Hardesty |journal=MIT News |date= January 21, 2010 |accessdate= August 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Impractical to implement when first developed by Gallager in 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Robert G. Gallager |title= Low Density Parity Check Codes |publisher= Monograph, M.I.T. Press |year= 1963 |url= http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/mackay/gallager/papers/ldpc.pdf |accessdate= August 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  LDPC codes were forgotten until his work was rediscovered in 1996.&lt;ref name=MacKay96&gt;[[David J.C. MacKay]] and Radford M. Neal, "Near Shannon Limit Performance of Low Density Parity Check Codes," Electronics Letters, July 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turbo code]]s, another class of capacity-approaching codes discovered in 1993, became the coding scheme of choice in the late 1990s, used for applications such as the [[Deep Space Network]] and [[satellite communication]]s. However, the advances in low-density parity-check codes have seen them surpass turbo codes in terms of [[error floor]] and performance in the higher [[code rate]] range, leaving turbo codes better suited for the lower code rates only.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsndocs/810-005/208/208B.pdf Telemetry Data Decoding, Design Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
In 2003, an irregular repeat accumulate (IRA) style LDPC code beat six turbo codes to become the error correcting code in the new [[DVB-S2]] standard for the satellite transmission of [[digital television]].&lt;ref name="hughesdvb"&gt;[http://www.ieeevtc.org/vtc2003fall/2003panelsessions/llee.pdf Presentation by Hughes Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008053124/http://www.ieeevtc.org/vtc2003fall/2003panelsessions/llee.pdf |date=2006-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVB-S2 selection committee made  decoder complexity estimates for the Turbo Code proposals using a much less efficient serial decoder architecture rather than a parallel decoder architecture. This forced the Turbo Code proposals to use frame sizes on the order of one half the frame size of the LDPC proposals. 

In 2008, LDPC beat convolutional turbo codes as the [[forward error correction]] (FEC) system for the [[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepnablog.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/12/ghn-a-phy-for-all-seasons.html HomePNA Blog: G.hn, a PHY For All Seasons]&lt;/ref&gt; G.hn chose LDPC codes over turbo codes because of their lower decoding complexity (especially when operating at data rates close to 1.0 Gbit/s) and because the proposed turbo codes exhibited a significant [[error floor]] at the desired range of operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ds2.es/ds2blog/2009/10/ieee-communications-magazine-paper-on-ghn.html IEEE Communications Magazine paper on G.hn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213012126/http://blog.ds2.es/ds2blog/2009/10/ieee-communications-magazine-paper-on-ghn.html |date=2009-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LDPC codes are also used for [[10GBase-T]] Ethernet, which sends data at 10 gigabits per second over twisted-pair cables. As of 2009, LDPC codes are also part of the [[Wi-Fi]] 802.11 standard as an optional part of [[802.11n]] and [[802.11ac]], in the High Throughput (HT) PHY specification.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Standard, section 20.3.11.6 [http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.11n-2009.pdf "802.11n-2009"], IEEE, October 29, 2009, accessed March 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[OFDM]] systems add an additional outer error correction that fixes the occasional errors (the "error floor") that get past the LDPC correction inner code even at low [[bit error rate]]s.
For example:
The [[Reed-Solomon code]] with LDPC Coded Modulation (RS-LCM) uses a Reed-Solomon outer code.&lt;ref&gt;

"LDPC coded OFDM modulation for high spectral efficiency transmission"
&lt;/ref&gt;
The DVB-S2, the DVB-T2 and the DVB-C2 standards all use a [[BCH code]] outer code to mop up residual errors after LDPC decoding.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational use==
LDPC codes functionally are defined by a sparse [[parity-check matrix]]. This [[sparse matrix]] is often randomly generated, subject to the [[sparsity]] constraints—[[#Code construction|LDPC code construction]] is discussed [[#Code construction|later]]. These codes were first designed by Robert Gallager in 1962.

Below is a graph fragment of an example LDPC code using [[factor graph|Forney's factor graph notation]]. In this graph, ''n'' variable nodes in the top of the graph are connected to (''n''&amp;minus;''k'') constraint nodes in the bottom of the graph.

This is a popular way of graphically representing an (''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') LDPC code. The bits of a valid message, when placed on the '''T's''' at the top of the graph, satisfy the graphical constraints. Specifically, all lines connecting to a variable node (box with an '=' sign) have the same value, and all values connecting to a factor node (box with a '+' sign) must sum, [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] two, to zero (in other words, they must sum to an even number; or there must be an even number of odd values).

[[Image:ldpc code fragment factor graph.svg|none]]
Ignoring any lines going out of the picture, there are eight possible six-bit strings corresponding to valid codewords: (i.e., 000000, 011001, 110010, 101011, 111100, 100101, 001110, 010111). This LDPC code fragment represents a three-bit message encoded as six bits. Redundancy is used, here, to increase the chance of recovering from channel errors. This is a (6,&amp;nbsp;3) [[linear code]], with ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3.

Once again ignoring lines going out of the picture, the parity-check matrix representing this graph fragment is

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{H} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

In this matrix, each row represents one of the three parity-check constraints, while each column represents one of the six bits in the received codeword.

In this example, the eight codewords can be obtained by putting the [[parity-check matrix]] '''H''' into this form &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} -P^T | I_{n-k} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; through basic [[row operations]] in [[GF(2)]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{H}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}_1
\sim
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}_2
\sim
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}_3
\sim
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}_4.
&lt;/math&gt;

Step 1: H.

Step 2: Row 1 is added to row 3.

Step 3: Row 2 and 3 are swapped.

Step 4: Row 1 is added to row 3.

From this, the [[generator matrix]] '''G''' can be obtained as &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} I_k | P \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; (noting that in the special case of this being a binary code &lt;math&gt;P = -P&lt;/math&gt;), or specifically:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, by multiplying all eight possible 3-bit strings by '''G''', all eight valid codewords are obtained. For example, the codeword for the bit-string '101' is obtained by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} 
\cdot
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As a check, the row space of '''G''' is orthogonal to '''H''' such that &lt;math&gt; G H^T = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The bit-string '101' is found in as the first 3 bits of the codeword '101011'.

== Example Encoder ==

Figure 1 illustrates the functional components of most LDPC encoders.

[[File:LDPC encoder Figure.png|thumb|none|500px|Fig. 1. LDPC Encoder]]

During the encoding of a frame, the input data bits (D) are repeated and distributed to a set of constituent encoders.  The constituent encoders are typically accumulators and each accumulator is used to generate a parity symbol.  A single copy of the original data (S&lt;sub&gt;0,K-1&lt;/sub&gt;) is transmitted  with the parity bits (P) to make up the code symbols.  The S bits from each constituent encoder are discarded.

The parity bit may be used within another constituent code.

In an example using the DVB-S2 rate 2/3 code the encoded block size is 64800 symbols (N=64800) with 43200 data bits (K=43200) and 21600 parity bits (M=21600).  Each constituent code (check node) encodes 16 data bits except for the first parity bit which encodes 8 data bits.  The first 4680 data bits are repeated 13 times (used in 13 parity codes), while the remaining data bits are used in 3 parity codes (irregular LDPC code).

For comparison, classic turbo codes typically use two constituent codes configured in parallel, each of which encodes the entire input block (K) of data bits.  These constituent encoders are recursive convolutional codes (RSC) of moderate depth (8 or 16 states) that are separated by a code interleaver which interleaves one copy of the frame.

The LDPC code, in contrast, uses many low depth constituent codes (accumulators) in parallel, each of which encode only a small portion of the input frame.  The many constituent codes can be viewed as many low depth (2 state) 'convolutional codes' that are connected via the repeat and distribute operations. The repeat and distribute operations perform the function of the interleaver in the turbo code.

The ability to more precisely manage the connections of the various constituent codes and the level of redundancy for each input bit give more flexibility in the design of LDPC codes, which can lead to better performance than turbo codes in some instances. Turbo codes still seem to perform better than LDPCs at low code rates, or at least the design of well performing low rate codes is easier for Turbo Codes.

As a practical matter, the hardware that forms the accumulators is reused during the encoding process.  That is, once a first set of parity bits are generated and the parity bits stored, the same accumulator hardware is used to generate a next set of parity bits.

==Decoding==
{{Expert needed|Telecommunications|section|date=November 2008}}

As with other codes, the [[maximum likelihood decoding]] of an LDPC code on the [[binary symmetric channel]] is an [[NP-complete]] problem.  Performing optimal decoding for a NP-complete code of any useful size is not practical.

However, sub-optimal techniques based on iterative [[belief propagation]] decoding give excellent results and can be practically implemented.  The sub-optimal decoding techniques view each parity check that makes up the LDPC as an independent single parity check (SPC) code.  Each SPC code is decoded separately using [[Soft-in soft-out decoder|soft-in-soft-out]] (SISO) techniques such as [[Soft output Viterbi algorithm|SOVA]], [[BCJR algorithm|BCJR]], [[Maximum a posteriori estimation|MAP]], and other derivates thereof.  The soft decision information from each SISO decoding is cross-checked and updated with other redundant SPC decodings of the same information bit.  Each SPC code is then decoded again using the updated soft decision information.  This process is iterated until a valid code word is achieved or decoding is exhausted.  This type of decoding is often referred to as sum-product decoding.

The decoding of the SPC codes is often referred to as the "check node" processing, and the cross-checking of the variables is often referred to as the "variable-node" processing.

In a practical LDPC decoder implementation, sets of SPC codes are decoded in parallel to increase throughput.

In contrast, belief propagation on the [[binary erasure channel]] is particularly simple where it consists of iterative constraint satisfaction.

For example, consider that the valid codeword, 101011, from the example above, is transmitted across a binary erasure channel and received with the first and fourth bit erased to yield ?&amp;#8288;01?&amp;#8288;11. Since the transmitted message must have satisfied the code constraints, the message can be represented by writing the received message on the top of the factor graph.

In this example, the first bit cannot yet be recovered, because all of the constraints connected to it have more than one unknown bit. In order to proceed with decoding the message, constraints connecting to only one of the erased bits must be identified. In this example, only the second constraint suffices. Examining the second constraint, the fourth bit must have been zero, since only a zero in that position would satisfy the constraint.

This procedure is then iterated. The new value for the fourth bit can now be used in conjunction with the first constraint to recover the first bit as seen below. This means that the first bit must be a one to satisfy the leftmost constraint.

[[Image:ldpc code fragment factor graph w erasures decode step 2.svg|none]]

Thus, the message can be decoded iteratively. For other channel models, the messages passed between the variable nodes and check nodes are [[real number]]s, which express probabilities and likelihoods of belief.

This result can be validated by multiplying the corrected codeword '''r''' by the parity-check matrix '''H''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{Hr}
= 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}

\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}

=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Because the outcome '''z''' (the [[Decoding methods#Syndrome decoding|syndrome]]) of this operation is the three &amp;times; one zero vector, the resulting codeword '''r''' is successfully validated.

After the decoding is completed, the original message bits '101' can be extracted by looking at the first 3 bits of the codeword.

While illustrative, this erasure example does not show the use of soft-decision decoding or soft-decision message passing, which is used in virtually all commercial LDPC decoders.

=== Updating node information ===
In recent years, there has also been a great deal of work spent studying the effects of alternative schedules for variable-node and constraint-node update. The original technique that was used for decoding LDPC codes was known as ''flooding''. This type of update required that, before updating a variable node, all constraint nodes needed to be updated and vice versa. In later work by Vila Casado ''et al.'',&lt;ref name=Vila07&gt;A.I. Vila Casado, M. Griot, and R.Wesel, “Informed dynamic scheduling for belief propagation decoding of LDPC codes,” Proc. [[IEEE]] Int. Conf. on Comm. (ICC), June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; alternative update techniques were studied, in which variable nodes are updated with the newest available check-node information.

The intuition behind these algorithms is that variable nodes whose values vary the most are the ones that need to be updated first. Highly reliable nodes, whose [[log-likelihood ratio]] (LLR) magnitude is large and does not change significantly from one update to the next, do not require updates with the same frequency as other nodes, whose sign and magnitude fluctuate more widely.
These scheduling algorithms show greater speed of convergence and lower error floors than those that use flooding. These lower error floors are achieved by the ability of the Informed Dynamic Scheduling (IDS)&lt;ref name=Vila07/&gt; algorithm to overcome trapping sets of near codewords.&lt;ref name=Richardson03&gt;T. Richardson, “Error floors of LDPC codes,” in Proc. 41st Allerton Conf. Comm., Control, and Comput., Monticello, IL, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

When nonflooding scheduling algorithms are used, an alternative definition of iteration is used. For an (''n'',&amp;nbsp;''k'') LDPC code of rate ''k''/''n'', a full ''iteration'' occurs when ''n'' variable and ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''k'' constraint nodes have been updated, no matter the order in which they were updated.

=== Lookup table decoding ===
It is possible to decode LDPC codes on a relatively low-power microprocessor by the use of [[lookup table]]s.

While codes such as the LDPC are generally implemented on high-power processors, with long block lengths, there are also applications which use lower-power processors and short block lengths (1024).

Therefore, it is possible to precalculate the output bit based upon predetermined input bits. A table is generated which contains ''n'' entries (for a block length of 1024 bits, this would be 1024 bits long), and contains all possible entries for different input states (both errored and nonerrored).

As a bit is input, it is then added to a FIFO register, and the value of the FIFO register is then used to look up in the table the relevant output from the precalculated values.

By this method, very high iterations can be used, with little processor overhead, the only cost being that of the memory for the lookup table, such that LDPC decoding is possible even on a 4.0&amp;nbsp;MHz PIC chip.

== Code construction ==
For large block sizes, LDPC codes are commonly constructed by first studying the behaviour of decoders. As the block size tends to infinity, LDPC decoders can be shown to have a noise threshold below which decoding is reliably achieved, and above which decoding is not achieved,&lt;ref name=richardson01&gt;Thomas J. Richardson and M. Amin Shokrollahi and Rüdiger L. Urbanke, "Design of Capacity-Approaching Irregular Low-Density Parity-Check Codes," IEEE Transactions in Information Theory, 47(2), February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; colloquially referred to as the [[cliff effect]]. This threshold can be optimised by finding the best proportion of arcs from check nodes and arcs from variable nodes. An approximate graphical approach to visualising this threshold is an [[EXIT chart]].

The construction of a specific LDPC code after this optimization falls into two main types of techniques:

*Pseudorandom approaches
*Combinatorial approaches

Construction by a pseudo-random approach builds on theoretical results that, for large block size, a random construction gives good decoding performance.&lt;ref name=MacKay96/&gt; In general, pseudorandom codes have complex encoders, but pseudorandom codes with the best decoders can have simple encoders.&lt;ref name=richardson01b&gt;Thomas J. Richardson and Rüdiger L. Urbanke, "Efficient Encoding of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes," IEEE Transactions in Information Theory, 47(2), February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Various constraints are often applied to help ensure that the desired properties expected at the theoretical limit of infinite block size occur at a finite block size.

Combinatorial approaches can be used to optimize the properties of small block-size LDPC codes or to create codes with simple encoders.

Some LDPC codes are based on [[Reed–Solomon code]]s, such as the RS-LDPC code used in the [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;
Ahmad Darabiha, Anthony Chan Carusone, Frank R. Kschischang.
[http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~tcc/darabiha_jssc08.pdf "Power Reduction Techniques for LDPC Decoders"]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Compared to randomly generated LDPC codes, structured LDPC codes—such as the LDPC code used in the [[DVB-S2]] standard—can have simpler and therefore lower-cost hardware—in particular, codes constructed such that the H matrix is a [[circulant matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;
Zhengya Zhang, Venkat Anantharam, Martin J. Wainwright, and Borivoje Nikolic.
[https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zhengya/papers/jssc10_05437474.pdf "An Efficient 10GBASE-T Ethernet LDPC Decoder Design With Low Error Floors"].
&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet another way of constructing LDPC codes is to use [[finite geometry|finite geometries]]. This method was proposed by Y. Kou ''et al.'' in 2001.&lt;ref name=Kou1&gt;Y. Kou, S. Lin and M. Fossorier, "Low-Density Parity-Check Codes
Based on Finite Geometries: A Rediscovery and New Results," IEEE

A '''message sequence chart''' (or '''MSC''') is an [[interaction diagram]] from the [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]] family standardized by the [[International Telecommunication Union]].

The purpose of recommending MSC (Message Sequence Chart) is to provide a trace language for the specification and description of the communication behaviour of system components and their environment by means of message interchange. Since in MSCs the communication behaviour is presented in a very intuitive and transparent manner, particularly in the graphical representation, the MSC language is easy to
learn, use and interpret. In connection with other languages it can be used to support methodologies for system specification, design, simulation, testing, and documentation.

==History==
The first version of the MSC standard was released in March 12, 1993.

The 1996 version added references, ordering and [[Inline expansion|inlining]] expressions concepts, and introduced HMSC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.sdl-forum.org/MSC2000present/sld005.htm
| title=HMSC
| publisher=sdl-forum.org
| accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''H'''igh-level '''M'''essage '''S'''equence '''C'''harts), which are the way of expressing a sequence of MSCs.

The MSC 2000 version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; added object orientation, refined the use of data and time in diagrams, and added the concept of remote method calls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Latest version has been published in February 2011.

==Symbols in MSC==
The existing symbols are:
* MSC head, lifeline, and end: a vertical line with a box at the top, and a box or a cross at the bottom.
* Instance creation: horizontal dashed arrow to the newly created instance.[[File:Dynamic Process Creation in a Message Sequence Chart.png|thumb|Dynamic process creation in an MSC]]
* Message exchange: horizontal arrow.
* Control flow: horizontal arrow with the 'call' prefix, dashed arrow for reply symbol, method and suspension symbols in between. [[File:MSC CallOperation.png|thumb|Call operation in an MSC]]
* Timers: start, cancel, time out.
* Time interval: relative and absolute with a dashed vertical arrow. [[File:MSC TimeConstraint.png|thumb|Time constraint in an MSC]]
* Conditions: usually used to represent a state of the underlying state machine.
* Action: a box.
* In-line expressions: alternative composition, sequential composition, exception, optional region, parallel composition, iteration (loop).
* Reference: reference to another MSC. [[File:MSC Reference.png|thumb|MSC Reference in an MSC]]
* Data concept: The user can use any data concept, if binding is undefined the default data concept is the one from [[Specification and Description Language|SDL]] as defined in Z.121 recommendation.
* Coregion: a double dashed instance line to describe unordered events.

==Symbol extensions==
* [[SDL-RT]] has introduced:
** a semaphore instance representation. [[File:SDL-RT MSC Semaphore.png|thumb|SDL-RT Semaphore extension to MSC]]
** a save symbol to save messages.

==Comparison to UML==
UML 2.0 Sequence Diagram is strongly inspired by the ITU-T MSC. Still, for historical reasons, the default basic principles are quite different:
* Lifelines
:* In an MSC, the vertical lines are autonomous execution entities. They usually represent state machines executing in parallel. The state machines need not be on the same computer.
:* In a Sequence Diagram, a vertical line is usually an object. The object can be active (in its own thread of execution) or passive (in the execution context of an active object).
* Arrows
:* In an MSC an arrow is usually an asynchronous message sent from one entity to another one. Once the message is sent the sending entity resumes its execution.
:* In a Sequence Diagram an arrow is usually understood as an operation call on a class. It is therefore synchronous and the calling entity hangs until the operation returns.
 
It has been said that MSC has been considered as a candidate for the [[Unified Modeling Language#Interaction diagrams|interaction diagrams]] in UML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|author1=Ekkart Rudolph |author2=Jens Grabowski |author3=Peter Graubmann | accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, proponents of MSC such as [[Ericsson]] think that MSC is better than [[Unified Modeling Language|UML 2.0]] for modelling large or complex systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Live Sequence Charts==
[[David Harel]] suggested that MSC had shortcomings such as:
* MSC propose a weak [[Partially ordered set|partial ordering]] semantics that makes it impossible to capture some behavioral requirements,
* The relationship between the MSC requirements and the executable specification is not clear,
and proposed Live Sequence Charts (LSC) as an extension on the MSC standard .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1243">'''Model Elimination''' is the name attached to a pair of [[proof procedure]]s invented by [[Donald W. Loveland]], the first of which was published in 1968 in the Journal of the ACM. Their primary purpose is to carry out [[automated theorem proving]], though they can readily be extended to [[logic programming]], including the more general [[disjunctive logic programming]].

Model Elimination is closely related to [[Resolution (logic)|resolution]]
while also bearing characteristics of a [[Method of analytic tableaux|Tableaux]] method. It is a progenitor of the [[SLD resolution]] procedure used in the [[Prolog]] logic programming language.

While somewhat eclipsed by attention to and progress in Resolution
theorem provers, Model Elimination has continued to attract the
attention of researchers and software developers. Today there are several theorem provers under active development that are based on the Model Elimination procedure.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], a '''non-perturbative''' [[function (mathematics)|function]] or process is one that cannot be accurately described by [[perturbation theory]]. An example is the function

&lt;math&gt;f(x)=e^{-1/x^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:expinvsq.svg|frame|The function ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−1/''x''²&lt;/sup&gt;. The Taylor series is identically zero, but the function is not.]]

The [[Taylor series]] at x = 0  for this function is exactly zero to all orders in perturbation theory, but the function is non-zero if ''x'' ≠ 0.

The implication of this for physics is that there are some phenomena which are impossible to understand by perturbation theory, regardless of how many orders of perturbation theory we use. [[Instanton]]s are an example.

Therefore, in [[theoretical physics]], a '''non-perturbative''' solution or theory is one that does not require perturbation theory to explicate, or does not simply describe the dynamics of perturbations around some fixed background.  For this reason, non-perturbative solutions and theories yield insights into areas and subjects perturbative methods cannot reveal.

This subject constitutes a major part of contemporary [[mathematics education]]. Calculus has widespread applications in [[science]], [[economics]], and [[engineering]] and can solve many problems for which [[Elementary algebra|algebra]] alone is insufficient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6522">In [[mathematics]], a '''partition of unity''' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a set ''R'' of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s from ''X'' to the [[unit interval]] [0,1] such that for every point, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,
* there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'' where all but a [[finite set|finite]] number of the functions of ''R'' are 0, and
* the sum of all the function values at ''x'' is 1, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\;\sum_{\rho\in R} \rho(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Partition of unity illustration.svg|center|thumb|500px|A partition of unity of a circle with four functions. The circle is unrolled to a line segment (the bottom solid line) for graphing purposes. The dashed line on top is the sum of the functions in the partition.]]
Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space.  They are also important in the [[interpolation]] of data, in [[signal processing]], and the theory of [[spline function]]s.

== Existence ==
The existence of partitions of unity assumes two distinct forms:

# Given any [[open cover]] {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; of a space, there exists a partition {ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed ''over the same set I'' such that [[Support (mathematics)|supp]] ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;⊆''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Such a partition is said to be '''subordinate to the open cover''' {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
# If the space is locally-compact, given any open cover {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; of a space, there exists a partition {ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed over a possibly distinct index set ''J'' such that each ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; has [[compact support]] and for each ''j''∈''J'', supp ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;⊆''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for some ''i''∈''I''.

Thus one chooses either to have the [[support (mathematics)|supports]] indexed by the open cover, or compact supports.  If the space is [[compact space|compact]], then there exist partitions satisfying both requirements.

A finite open cover always has a continuous partition of unity subordinated to it, provided the space is locally compact and Hausdorff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Real and complex analysis|year=1987|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-054234-1|pages=40|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Paracompact space|Paracompactness]] of the space is a necessary condition to guarantee the existence of a partition of unity [[paracompact space|subordinate to any open cover]].  Depending on the [[category (mathematics)|category]] to which the space belongs, it may also be a sufficient condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charalambos D.|last=Aliprantis|first2=Kim C.|last2=Border
|title=Infinite dimensional analysis: a hitchhiker's guide
|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-32696-0|pages=716|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction uses [[mollifier]]s (bump functions), which exist in continuous and [[smooth manifolds]], but not in [[analytic manifold]]s. Thus for an open cover of an analytic manifold, an analytic partition of unity subordinate to that open cover generally does not exist. ''See'' [[analytic continuation]].

If ''R'' and ''S'' are partitions of unity for spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively, then the set of all pairwise products &lt;math&gt;\{\; \rho\sigma \;:\; \rho\in R \wedge \sigma \in S\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of unity for the [[cartesian product]] space ''X''×''Y''.

== Example ==
We can construct a partition of unity on &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; by looking at a chart on the complement of a point &lt;math&gt;p \in S^1&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;S^1 -\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with center &lt;math&gt;q \in S^1&lt;/math&gt;. Now, let &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; be a [[bump function]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined by&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \begin{cases}
\exp\left(\frac{1}{x^2-1}\right) &amp; x \in (-1,1) \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;then, both this function and &lt;math&gt;1 - \Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be extended uniquely onto &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;\Phi(p) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the set &lt;math&gt;\{ (S^1 - \{p\}, \Phi), (S^1 - \{q\}, 1-\Phi) \}&lt;/math&gt;forms a partition of unity over &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Variant definitions==
Sometimes a less restrictive definition is used: the sum of all the function values at a particular point is only required to be positive, rather than 1, for each point in the space.  However, given such a set of functions, one can obtain a partition of unity in the strict sense by dividing every function by the sum of all functions (which is defined, since at any point it has only a finite number of terms).

==Applications==
A partition of unity can be used to define the integral (with respect to a [[volume form]]) of a function defined over a manifold: One first defines the integral of a function whose support is contained in a single coordinate patch of the manifold; then one uses a partition of unity to define the integral of an arbitrary function; finally one shows that the definition is independent of the chosen partition of unity.

A partition of unity can be used to show the existence of a [[Riemannian metric]] on an arbitrary manifold.

[[Method of steepest descent#The case of multiple non-degenerate saddle points|Method of steepest descent]] employs a partition of unity to construct asymptotics of integrals.

[[Linkwitz–Riley filter]] is an example of practical implementation of partition of unity to separate input signal into two output signals containing only high- or low-frequency components.

The [[Bernstein polynomial]]s of a fixed degree ''m'' are a family of ''m''+1 linearly independent polynomials that are a partition of unity for the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9137">In [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], '''Petrick's method''' (also known as the ''branch-and-bound'' method) is a technique described by [[Stanley R. Petrick]] (1931&lt;!-- *1931-08-16 or 1931-08-06 Cedar Rapids, Iowa --&gt;–2006&lt;!-- +2006-07-27 Denver, Colorado --&gt;)&lt;ref name="Petrick_Bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrick_Obit"/&gt; in 1956&lt;ref name="Petrick_1956"/&gt; for determining all minimum sum-of-products solutions from a [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm|prime implicant chart]]. Petrick's method is very tedious for large charts, but it is easy to implement on a computer.

'''Algorithm'''
# Reduce the prime implicant chart by eliminating the essential prime implicant rows and the corresponding columns.
# Label the rows of the reduced prime implicant chart &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_4&lt;/math&gt;, etc.
# Form a logical function &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; which is true when all the columns are covered. ''P'' consists of a product of sums where each sum term has the form &lt;math&gt;(P_{i0} + P_{i1} + &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; + P_{iN})&lt;/math&gt;, where each &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; represents a row covering column &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.
# Reduce &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to a minimum sum of products by multiplying out and applying &lt;math&gt;X + XY = X&lt;/math&gt;.
# Each term in the result represents a solution, that is, a set of rows which covers all of the minterms in the table. To determine the minimum solutions, first find those terms which contain a minimum number of prime implicants.
# Next, for each of the terms found in step five, count the number of literals in each prime implicant and find the total number of literals.
# Choose the term or terms composed of the minimum total number of literals, and write out the corresponding sums of prime implicants.

'''Example of Petrick's method'''&lt;ref name="Example"/&gt;

Following is the function we want to reduce:

:&lt;math&gt;f(A,B,C) =\sum m(0,1,2,5,6,7)\,&lt;/math&gt;

The prime implicant chart from the [[Quine-McCluskey algorithm]] is as follows:

                 | 0 1 2 5 6 7
  ---------------|------------
    K (0,1) a'b' | X X
    L (0,2) a'c' | X   X
    M (1,5) b'c  |   X   X
    N (2,6) bc'  |     X   X
    P (5,7) ac   |       X   X
    Q (6,7) ab   |         X X

Based on the X marks in the table above, build a product of sums of the rows where each row is added, and columns are multiplied together:

  (K+L)(K+M)(L+N)(M+P)(N+Q)(P+Q)

Use the distributive law to turn that expression into a sum of products.  Also use the following equivalences to simplify the final expression:     X + XY = X         and         XX = X       and       X+X=X

  = (K+L)(K+M)(L+N)(M+P)(N+Q)(P+Q)
  = (K+LM)(N+LQ)(P+MQ)
  = (KN+KLQ+LMN+LMQ)(P+MQ)
  = KNP + KLPQ + LMNP + LMPQ + KMNQ + KLMQ + LMNQ + LMQ

Now use again the following equivalence to further reduce the equation:    X + XY = X

  = KNP + KLPQ + LMNP + LMQ + KMNQ

Choose products with fewest terms, in this example, there are two products with three terms:

  KNP
  LMQ

Choose term or terms with fewest total literals. In our example, the two products both expand to six literals total each:

 KNP    expands to    a'b'+ bc'+ ac
 LMQ    expands to    a'c'+ b'c + ab

So either one can be used. In general, application of Petrick's method is tedious for large charts, but it is easy to implement on a computer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5266">In [[combinatorial game theory]], '''poset games''' are [[mathematical game|mathematical]] [[game of strategy|games of strategy]], generalizing many well-known games such as [[Nim]] and [[Chomp]].&lt;ref name="MSCW2011" /&gt; In such games, two players start with a [[poset]] (a '''partially ordered set'''), and take turns choosing one point in the poset, removing it and all points that are greater. The player who is left with no point to choose, loses.

==Game play==
Given a [[partially ordered set]] (''P'',&amp;nbsp;&lt;), let 
:&lt;math&gt; P_x = P - \{ a\mid a \geq x\} &lt;/math&gt;
denote the poset formed by removing ''x'' from ''P''.

A poset game on ''P'', played between two players conventionally named [[Alice and Bob]], is as follows:

* Alice chooses a point ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''P''; thus replacing ''P'' with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, and then passes the turn to Bob who plays on ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, and passes the turn to Alice.
* A player loses if it is his/her turn and there are no points to choose.

==Examples==
If ''P'' is a [[finite set|finite]] [[totally ordered set]], then game play in ''P'' is exactly the same as the game play in a game of [[Nim]] with a heap of size |''P''|. For, in both games, it is possible to choose a move that leads to a game of the same type whose size is any number smaller than |''P''|. In the same way, a poset game with a disjoint union of total orders is equivalent to a game of Nim with multiple heaps with sizes equal to the chains in the poset.

A special case of [[Hackenbush]], in which all edges are green (able to be cut by either player) and every configuration takes the form of a [[tree (graph theory)|forest]], may be expressed similarly, as a poset game on a poset in which, for every element ''x'', there is at most one element ''y'' for which ''x'' [[covering relation|covers]] ''y''. If ''x'' covers ''y'', then ''y'' is the parent of ''x'' in the forest on which the game is played.

[[Chomp]] may be expressed similarly, as a poset game on the [[Product order|product]] of total orders from which the [[infimum]] has been removed.

==Grundy value==
Poset games are [[impartial game]]s, meaning that every move available to Alice would also be available to Bob if Alice were allowed to [[Null move|pass]], and vice versa. Therefore, by the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]], every position in a poset game has a Grundy value, a number describing an equivalent position in the game of Nim. The Grundy value of a poset may be calculated as the least natural number which is not the Grundy value of any ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''P''. That is,&lt;ref name="Byrnes2003"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;G(P)=\min\bigl(\mathbb{N}\setminus \{G(P_x)\mid x\in P\}\bigr).&lt;/math&gt;

This number may be used to describe the optimal game play in a poset game.  In particular, the Grundy value is nonzero when the player whose turn it is has a winning strategy, and zero when the current player cannot win against optimal play from his or her opponent. A winning strategy in the game consists of moving to a position whose Grundy value is zero, whenever this is possible.

==Strategy stealing==
A [[strategy-stealing argument]] shows that the Grundy value is nonzero for every poset that has a [[supremum]]. For, let ''x'' be the supremum of a partially ordered set ''P''. If ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' has Grundy value zero, then ''P'' itself has a nonzero value, by the formula above; in this case, ''x'' is a winning move in ''P''. If, on the other hand, ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' has a nonzero Grundy value, then there must be a winning move ''y'' in ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', such that the Grundy value of (''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; is zero. But by the assumption that ''x'' is a supremum, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' and  (''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', so the winning move ''y'' is also available in ''P'' and again ''P'' must have a nonzero Grundy value.&lt;ref name="MSCW2011"/&gt;

For more trivial reasons a poset with an infimum also has a nonzero Grundy value: moving to the infimum is always a winning move.

==Complexity==
Deciding the winner of an arbitrary finite poset game is [[PSPACE-complete]].&lt;ref name="Grier2012" /&gt; This means that unless P=PSPACE, computing the Grundy value of an arbitrary poset game is computationally difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2100">In [[mathematics]], the '''quasi-commutative property''' is an extension or generalization of the general [[commutative property]]. This property is used in specific applications with various definitions.

==Applied to matrices==

Two [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] ''p'' and ''q'' are said to have the [[commutative property]] whenever
:&lt;math&gt;pq = qp&lt;/math&gt;

The quasi-commutative property in matrices is defined&lt;ref name=McCoy&gt;Neal H. McCoy. [http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1934-036-02/S0002-9947-1934-1501746-8/S0002-9947-1934-1501746-8.pdf On quasi-commutative matrices. ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 36''(2), 327–340].&lt;/ref&gt; as follows. Given two non-commutable matrices ''x'' and ''y''
:&lt;math&gt; xy - yx = z&lt;/math&gt;
satisfy the quasi-commutative property whenever ''z'' satisfies the following properties:
:&lt;math&gt; xz = zx &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; yz = zy &lt;/math&gt;

An example is found in the [[matrix mechanics]] introduced by [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] as a version of [[quantum mechanics]]. In this mechanics, ''p'' and ''q'' are infinite matrices corresponding respectively to the momentum and position variables of a particle.&lt;ref name=McCoy/&gt; These matrices are written out at [[Matrix mechanics#Harmonic oscillator]], and z = iħ times the infinite [[Identity matrix|unit matrix]], where ħ is the [[reduced Planck constant]].

==Applied to functions==

A function ''f'', defined as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;f: X \times Y \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt;
is said to be quasi-commutative&lt;ref&gt;Benaloh, J., &amp; De Mare, M. (1994, January).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14872">[[File:Semiorder.svg|thumb|An example of a semiorder, shown by its [[Hasse diagram]]. Two points are comparable when their vertical  coordinates differ by at least one unit (the spacing between consecutive solid blue lines).]]
In [[order theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''semiorder''' is a type of ordering that may be determined for a set of items with numerical scores by declaring two items to be incomparable when their scores are within a given [[margin of error]] of each other, and by using the numerical comparison of their scores when those scores are sufficiently far apart. Semiorders were introduced and applied in [[mathematical psychology]] by {{harvtxt|Luce|1956}} as a model of human preference without the assumption that indifference is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. They generalize [[strict weak ordering]]s, form a special case of [[partial order]]s and [[interval order]]s, and can be characterized among the partial orders by two forbidden four-item suborders.

==Definition==
Let ''X'' be a set of items, and let &lt; be a [[binary relation]] on ''X''.
Items ''x'' and ''y'' are said to be ''incomparable'', written here as ''x''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''y'', if neither ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' nor ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x'' is true. Then the pair (''X'',&lt;) is a semiorder if it satisfies the following three axioms:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Luce|1956}} describes an equivalent set of four axioms, the first two of which combine the definition of incomparability and the first axiom listed here.&lt;/ref&gt;
#For all ''x'' and ''y'', it is not possible for both ''x'' &lt; ''y'' and ''y'' &lt; ''x'' to be true. That is, &lt; must be an [[asymmetric relation]]
#For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''w'', if it is true that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''z'', and ''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''w'', then it must also be true that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''w''.
#For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''w'', if it is true that ''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''y'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z'', and ''y''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''w'', then it cannot also be true that ''x''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''w'' and ''z''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''w'' simultaneously.

{| style="float:right"
| [[File:SemiorderAxiom3 svg.svg|thumb|100px|Axiom 3]]
|}
{| style="float:right"
| [[File:SemiorderAxiom2 svg.svg|thumb|100px|Axiom 2]]
|}
It follows from the first axiom that ''x''&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;''x'', and therefore the second axiom (with ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z'') implies that &lt; is a [[transitive relation]].

One may define a [[partial order]] (''X'',≤) from a semiorder (''X'',&lt;) by declaring that {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} whenever either {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; ''y''}} or {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}. Of the axioms that a partial order is required to obey, reflexivity follows automatically from this definition, antisymmetry follows from the first semiorder axiom, and transitivity follows from the second semiorder axiom. Conversely, from a partial order defined in this way, the semiorder may be recovered by declaring that {{nowrap|''x'' &lt; ''y''}} whenever {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ ''y''}}. The first of the semiorder axioms listed above follows automatically from the axioms defining a partial order, but the others do not. The second and third semiorder axioms forbid partial orders of four items forming two disjoint chains: the second axiom forbids two chains of two items each, while the third item forbids a three-item chain with one unrelated item.

==Utility==
The original motivation for introducing semiorders was to model human preferences without assuming (as strict weak orderings do) that incomparability is a [[transitive relation]]. For instance, if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' represent three quantities of the same material, and ''x'' and ''z'' differ by the smallest amount that is perceptible as a difference, while ''y'' is halfway between the two of them, then it is reasonable for a preference to exist between ''x'' and ''z'' but not between the other two pairs, violating transitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Luce|1956}}, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, suppose that ''X'' is a set of items, and ''u'' is a [[utility function]] that maps the members of ''X'' to [[real number]]s. A strict weak ordering can be defined on ''x'' by declaring two items to be incomparable when they have equal utilities, and otherwise using the numerical comparison, but this necessarily leads to a transitive incomparability relation. Instead, if one sets a numerical threshold (which may be normalized to 1) such that utilities within that threshold of each other are declared incomparable, then a semiorder arises.

Specifically, define a binary relation &lt; from ''X'' and ''u'' by setting ''x'' &lt; ''y'' whenever ''u''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''u''(''y'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1. Then (''X'',&lt;) is a semiorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Luce|1956}}, Theorem 3 describes a more general situation in which the threshold for comparability between two utilities is a function of the utility rather than being identically 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It may equivalently be defined as the [[interval order]] defined by the intervals [''u''(''x''),''u''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fishburn|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other direction, not every semiorder can be defined from numerical utilities in this way. For instance, if a semiorder (''X'',&lt;) includes an [[uncountable]] [[total order|totally ordered subset]] then there do not exist sufficiently many sufficiently well-spaced real-numbers to represent this subset numerically. However, every finite semiorder can be defined from a utility function.&lt;ref&gt;This result is typically credited to {{harvtxt|Scott|Suppes|1958}}; see, e.g., {{harvtxt|Rabinovitch|1977}}. However, {{harvtxt|Luce|1956}}, Theorem 2 proves a more general statement, that a finite semiorder can be defined from a utility function and a threshold function whenever a certain underlying weak order can be defined numerically. For finite semiorders, it is trivial that the weak order can be defined numerically with a unit threshold function.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harvtxt|Fishburn|1973}} supplies a precise characterization of the semiorders that may be defined numerically.

According to [[Amartya K. Sen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.ihs.ac.at/publications/eco/visit_profs/blume/sen.pdf | author=Amartya K. Sen | title=Choice Functions and Revealed Preference | journal=[[The Review of Economic Studies]] | volume=38 | number=3 | pages=307–317 | date=Jul 1971 }} Here: Sect.10, p.314&lt;/ref&gt; semi-orders were examined by [[Dean T. Jamison]] and [[Lawrence J. Lau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | url= | author=Dean T. Jamison and Lawrence J. Lau | title=Semiorders, Revealed Preference,  and the Theory of the Consumer Demand | institution=Stanford University,  Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences | type=Technical Report No.31 | date=Jul 1970 }} Presented at the World Economics Congress, Cambridge, Sep 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; and found to be a special case of [[quasitransitive relation]]s. In fact, every semiorder is a quasitransitive relation, since it is a transitive one. Moreover, adding to a given semiorder all its pairs of incomparable items keeps the resulting relation a quasitransitive one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | arxiv=1806.05036v2 | author=Jochen Burghardt | title=Simple Laws about Nonprominent Properties of Binary Relations | type=Technical Report | date=Nov 2018 }} Here: Lemma 20, p.27. Since Luce modelled indifference between ''x'' and ''y'' as "neither ''xRy'' nor ''yRx''", while Sen modelled it as "both ''xRy'' and ''xRy''", Sen's remark on p.314 is likely to mean the latter property.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other results==
The number of distinct semiorders on ''n'' unlabeled items is given by the [[Catalan number]]s
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n},&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kim|Roush|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
while the number of semiorders on ''n'' labeled items is given by the sequence
:1, 1, 3, 19, 183, 2371, 38703, 763099, 17648823, ... {{OEIS|A006531}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chandon|Lemaire|Pouget|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any finite semiorder has [[order dimension]] at most three.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rabinovitch|1978}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all partial orders with a fixed number of elements and a fixed number of comparable pairs, the partial orders that have the largest number of [[linear extension]]s are semiorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Fishburn|Trotter|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiorders are known to obey the [[1/3–2/3 conjecture]]: in any finite semiorder that is not a total order, there exists a pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''x'' appears earlier than ''y'' in between 1/3 and 2/3 of the linear extensions of the semiorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brightwell|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of semiorders on an ''n''-element set is ''well-graded'': if two semiorders on the same set differ from each other by the addition or removal of ''k'' order relations, then it is possible to find a path of ''k'' steps from the first semiorder to the second one, in such a way that each step of the path adds or removes a single order relation and each intermediate state in the path is itself a semiorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Doignon|Falmagne|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Comparability graph|incomparability graph]]s of semiorders are called [[indifference graph]]s, and are a special case of the [[interval graph]]s.{{sfnp|Roberts|1969}}

If a semiorder is given only in terms of the order relation between its pairs of elements, then it is possible to construct a utility function that represents the order in time {{math|''O''(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of elements in the semiorder.{{sfnp|Avery|1992}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2465">In [[mathematics]], two positive (or [[signed measure|signed]] or [[complex measure|complex]]) measures ''&amp;mu;'' and ''&amp;nu;'' defined on a [[measurable space]] (&amp;Omega;, &amp;Sigma;) are called '''singular''' if there exist two disjoint sets ''A'' and ''B'' in  &amp;Sigma; whose [[set union|union]] is &amp;Omega; such that ''&amp;mu;'' is zero on all measurable subsets of ''B'' while ''&amp;nu;'' is zero on all measurable subsets of ''A''. This is denoted by  &lt;math&gt;\mu \perp \nu.&lt;/math&gt;

A refined form of [[Lebesgue's decomposition theorem]] decomposes a singular measure into a singular continuous measure and a [[discrete measure]]. See below for examples.

==Examples on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;==
As a particular case, a measure defined on the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is called ''singular'', if it is singular with respect to the [[Lebesgue measure]] on this space. For example, the [[Dirac delta function]] is a singular measure.

'''Example.''' A [[discrete measure]].

The [[Heaviside step function]] on the [[real line]],

: &lt;math&gt;H(x) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \begin{cases} 0, &amp; x &lt; 0; \\ 1, &amp; x \geq 0; \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

has the [[Dirac delta function|Dirac delta distribution]] &lt;math&gt;\delta_0&lt;/math&gt; as its [[distributional derivative]]. This is a measure on the real line, a "[[point mass]]" at 0. However, the [[Dirac measure]] &lt;math&gt;\delta_0&lt;/math&gt; is not absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, nor is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; absolutely continuous with respect to &lt;math&gt;\delta_0&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\lambda ( \{ 0 \} ) = 0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\delta_0 ( \{ 0 \} ) = 1&lt;/math&gt;; if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is any [[open set]] not containing 0, then &lt;math&gt;\lambda (U) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\delta_0 (U) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Example.''' A singular continuous measure.

The [[Cantor distribution]] has a [[cumulative distribution function]] that is continuous but not [[absolutely continuous]], and indeed its absolutely continuous part is zero: it is singular continuous.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2098">A '''Variation''' can refer to a specific sequence of successive moves in a turn-based game, often used to specify a hypothetical future state of a game that is being played. Although the term is most commonly used in the context of [[Chess]] analysis, it has been applied to other games. It also is a useful term used when describing computer [[game tree|tree]]-search algorithms (for example [[minimax algorithm|minimax]]) for playing games such as [[Go (board game)|Go]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andromeda.com/people/ddyer/go/search.html|title=Searches, tree pruning and tree ordering in Go|date=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Chess]].

A variation can be any number of steps as long as each step would be legal if it were to be played. It is often as far ahead as a human or computer can calculate; or however long is necessary to reach a particular position of interest. It may also lead to a terminal state in the game, in which case the term "Winning Variation" or "Losing Variation" is sometimes used.

==Principal variation==
[[Image:Principle variation 16bit.PNG|thumb|right|The principal variation of this [[minimax]] [[game tree]] is shown in blue]]
The principal variation refers to the particular variation that is the most advantageous to the current player, assuming each other player will respond with the move that best improves their own position. In other words, it is the "best" or "correct" line of play. In the context of [[game tree|tree]]-searching game [[Artificial Intelligence]] – in which this term is most common – it may also refer to the sequence of moves which is currently ''believed'' to be the most advantageous, but is not guaranteed due to the technical limitations of the algorithm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2585">The '''water-pouring algorithm''' is a technique used in [[digital communications]] systems for allocating power among different channels in multicarrier schemes. It was described by R. C. Gallager in 1968&lt;ref name="gallager"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gallager |first=R. C. |publisher=Wiley |year=1968 |title=Information Theory and Reliable Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the '''water-pouring theorem''' which proves its optimality for channels having [[Additive White Gaussian Noise]] (AWGN) and [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI).
For this reason, it is a standard baseline algorithm for various digital communications systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

 | title = Power allocation scheme for DMT-based modems employing simplex transmission

 | class = 375/222
 | quote = The optimum approach for Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), has been proved to be a `water pouring` algorithm of power distribution, where the g.sub.k.multidot.N.sub.k.sup.1 profile is considered to be equivalent to the `terrain` and the available power budget is likened to `water that is poured` on the terrain. In this analogy, the water depth at position k is equivalent to the power allocated to the frequency bin k.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intuition that gives the algorithm its name is to think of the communication medium as if it was some kind of water container with an uneven bottom. Each of the available channels is then a section of the container having its own depth, given by the reciprocal of the frequency-dependent [[Signal-to-noise ratio|SNR]] for the channel.&lt;ref name="gallager"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horrible"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Biglieri |first=Ezio |title=Coding and modulation for a horrible channel  |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |volume=41 |issue=5 |date=May 2003 |pages=92–98 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2003.1200107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
To allocate power, imagine pouring water into this container (the amount depends on the desired maximum average transmit power). After the water level settles, the largest amount of water is in the deepest sections of the container. This implies allocating more power to the channels with the most favourable SNR. Note, however, that the ratio allocation to each channel is not a fixed proportion but varies nonlinearly with the maximum average transmit power.
