'''''A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain''''' is a book by the British writer [[Owen Hatherley]], published by [[Verso Books]] in November 2010.&lt;ref name=vb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/951-a-guide-to-the-new-ruins-of-great-britain|title=A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain|accessdate=18 April 2012|publisher=[[Verso Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is a critique of the [[architecture]] and [[urbanism]] of [[postmodernity|postmodern]] Britain,&lt;ref name=at/&gt; taking the form of a tour of British cities.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/03/guide-new-ruins-hatherley-review|title=A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain by Owen Hatherley|date=3 October 2010|accessdate=17 April 2012|work=[[The Observer]]|first=Rowan|last=Moore|authorlink=Rowan Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain'' is Hatherley's second book, following a quartet of essays entitled ''[[Militant Modernism]]'' published in 2008. Considerable overlap and repetition exists between the two works.&lt;ref name=lrb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v34/n05/will-self/it-hits-in-the-gut|title=It hits in the gut|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=18 April 2012|first=Will|last=Self|authorlink=Will Self|work=[[London Review of Books]]|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hatherley introduces ''A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain'' as "an [[autopsy]] of the [[urban renaissance]]", referring to a program initiated under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] and associated with the [[private finance initiative]], [[city academies]] and the [[Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment]].&lt;ref name=at/&gt; In his introduction, Hatherley quotes [[Karl Seitz]]'s statement upon the opening of the [[Karl Marx-Hof]] in [[Vienna]]: "by these stones shall we be judged." Seitz's words, set in the context of the attack on the Karl Marx-Hof a year later by fascists fighting the [[Austrian Civil War]], serve as guiding principles for the book.&lt;ref name=sm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/book_review_a_guide_to_the_new_ruins_of_great_britain_1_825766|title=Book review: A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain|date=18 October 2010|accessdate=18 April 2012|work=[[The Scotsman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book forms a ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of what the author describes as "pseudomodernism".&lt;ref name=lrb/&gt;

The journey, on which Hatherley was accompanied by photographer Joel Anderson,&lt;ref name=od&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/ken-worpole/guide-to-new-ruins-of-great-britain|title=A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain|date=11 December 2010|accessdate=18 April 2012|work=[[openDemocracy.net]]|first=Ken|last=Worpole}}&lt;/ref&gt; begins in [[Southampton]], where Hatherley grew up, and takes in [[Milton Keynes]], [[Nottingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Tyneside]], [[Glasgow]], [[Cambridge]], several towns in [[Yorkshire]], [[Cardiff]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Greenwich]]. Hatherley focuses on the prior decade's programmes of [[regeneration (architecture)|regeneration]] and the remains of past civic improvements.&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; In Cambridge, Hatherley reluctantly praises the [[Accordia]] development;&lt;ref name=at/&gt; while in Glasgow he describes [[BBC Pacific Quay]] as "decent, upstanding, moderate modernism" and praises buildings in the vicinity of [[Glasgow Central station]];&lt;ref name=sm/&gt; and in Tyneside he praises [[T. Dan Smith]]'s desire to build a "[[Brasilia]] of the North".&lt;ref name=lrb/&gt;

Hatherley most keenly explores the public and municipal architecture of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including [[Thamesmead]] in [[Greenwich]], [[Red Road (flats)|Red Road]] in Glasgow, [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill]] in Sheffield and the [[Get Carter car park|''Get Carter'' car park]] in [[Gateshead]].&lt;ref name=at&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/?p=10820|title=A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain: Owen Hatherley|date=24 October 2010|accessdate=17 April 2012|work=Architecture Today|first=Patrick|last=Wright|authorlink=Patrick Wright (historian)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314221515/http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/?p=10820|archive-date=2012-03-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particular attention is paid to "the Former [[Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire]]", where Hatherley sees the promise of Socialist [[Brutalism]] having come closest to fulfillment. Hatherley criticises [[Bob Kerslake]], the former chief executive of [[Sheffield City Council]] who presided over the demolition of council housing, and the [[Housing Market Renewal Initiative|Pathfinder]] scheme.&lt;ref name=lrb/&gt;

Hatherley's influences include [[Ian Nairn]],&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; [[Nikolaus Pevsner]],&lt;ref name=gu/&gt; [[J. B. Priestley]]'s ''[[English Journey]]''&lt;ref name=at/&gt;&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;&lt;ref name=sm/&gt; and [[Iain Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

==Critical reception==
[[Patrick Wright (historian)|Patrick Wright]], writing in ''Architecture Today'', compares Hatherley's approach to that of [[William Cobbett]], the 19th century [[agitator]] who criticised [[industrialisation]] in his ''[[Rural Rides]]''; however, he points out that while Cobbett defended the British countryside, Hatherley is concerned with the urban Britain envisioned by post-war [[Modernist architects]] which he argues has fallen victim to [[regeneration (architecture)|regeneration]] schemes.&lt;ref name=at/&gt;

[[Rowan Moore]], writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', describes Hatherley as "not entirely fair" for his failure to grant a [[right of reply]] to those he criticises, the book's lack of input from the citizens and residents of the areas described, and its lack of any proposed alternative, but describes ''A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain'' as "essentially right: for all the talk of renewal, renaissance, regeneration and world-class architecture, and all the billions expended, our cities are, with some exceptions, more screwed up than they have ever been."&lt;ref name=gu/&gt;

[[Will Self]], reviewing ''Militant Modernism'' and ''A Guide to the New Ruins of Great Britain'' in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'', describes the latter as "engaging and even stimulating", but argues that Hatherley fails to accept the deep-seated and [[wikt:philoprogenitive|philoprogenitive]] bad [[taste (sociology)|taste]] of the masses, instead favouring an ethic shaped by urban [[reductionism]]. Self also alleges similarities between Hatherley's argument regarding "pseudomodernism" and that of the architect [[Rem Koolhaas]], whose work Hatherley criticises.&lt;ref name=lrb/&gt;

'''Alma Kruger''' (September 13, 1868&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wm05.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=2:39465~T1|title=Alma Kruger Biography|publisher=allmovie.com|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1871&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0472557|title=Alma Kruger|publisher=[[IMDb]]|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; April 5, 1960) was an American actress.

==Career==
Born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], Kruger had a long career on stage before appearing in films. From 1907 to 1935, she featured in theatre plays on Broadway, mostly in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] plays such as ''[[Hamlet]]'' (as Gertrude), ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' (as Olivia), ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' (Widow), and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (Nerissa).

Kruger was brought to Hollywood by [[Samuel Goldwyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alma Kruger to Be In 'Soldiers Three'|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5819858/oakland_tribune/|work=Oakland Tribune|agency=Associated Press|date=December 12, 1935|location=California, Oakland|page=28|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 7, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared in her first film ''[[These Three]]'' (1936) while in her 60s. She then proceeded to act in over 40 films in the space of little more than a decade. Among her notable roles was Nurse Molly Byrd, the superintendent of nurses in the popular [[Dr. Kildare]]/Dr. Gillespie film series,&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; appearing in all but the first two of the 16 movies. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

She portrayed Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] in ''[[Marie Antoinette (1938 film)|Marie Antoinette]]'' (1938)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amusements|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5819906/rushville_republican/|work=Rushville Republican|date=September 27, 1938|location=Indiana, Rushville|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 7, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the almost mother-in-law of [[Rosalind Russell]]'s lead character in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940). In 1942, she appeared as the subversive society matron Henrietta Sutton in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Saboteur (film)|Saboteur]]'' (1942). Kruger's last film appearance was in the film ''[[Forever Amber (film)|Forever Amber]]'' (1947).

On radio, Kruger played Emily Mayfield on ''Those We Love'' and the captain's wife on ''Show Boat''.&lt;ref name=rs&gt;DeLong, Thomas A. (1996). ''Radio Stars: An Illustrated Biographical Dictionary of 953 Performers, 1920 through 1960''. McFarland &amp; Company, Inc. p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Kruger died of natural causes April 5, 1960 in a nursing home in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news|title=Alma Kruger, Film, Radio Actress, Dies|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5819776/wisconsin_state_journal/|work=Wisconsin State Journal|agency=Associated Press|date=April 8, 1960|location=Wisconsin, Madison|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = July 7, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- aged either 88 or 91 depending on year of birth --&gt;

'''Armenians in Serbia''' refers to ethnic [[Armenians]] living in [[Serbia]].

Armenians were recorded in Serbia in 1218 when [[Saint Sava]] invited constructors to build a Serbian Orthodox monastery after he had been to [[Armenia]] and seen the beautiful Armenian architecture there. The Armenians were to build Vitovnica Monastery, which has preserved a bilingual sacral text in Serbian and Armenian dating to the building.&lt;ref name="arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs"&gt;[http://arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs/arhiva/2006/04/27/srpski/R06042602.shtml Parastos kod Krsta u kamenu] ГЛАС JАВНОСТИ&lt;/ref&gt;

Armenians were a small part of the Ottoman Turkish army when they invaded Serbia prior to the [[Battle of Kosovo|Battle of Kosovo 1389]]. However upon hearing that they would attack a [[Christian]] people, they fled the Ottomans to the other side to fight alongside the Serbs. After the battle, the surviving Armenians settled in the hills of [[Sokobanja]] where they built Jermenčić Monastery.&lt;ref name="arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs"/&gt; 

Evliya Celebi registers an Armenian "district" of [[Užice]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://facta.junis.ni.ac.rs/pas/pas2003/pas2003-02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Remains of an Armenian graveyard lie in [[Kalemegdan|Kalemegdan fortress]], which was last used in the 17th century after the Ottomans destroyed it. Only a few tombs are left in good condition. In 1810 the Turks destroyed the [[Celije Monastery]], and the Serbs rebuilt it in 1811 with the help of wealthy Armenians. One of the benefactors had his idea of an Armenian style dome included in the work, so the monastery today can be considered an outcome of Byzantine/Serbian-Armenian architecture.

In 1880s, merchants from the [[Kemah, Turkey|Gamakh]] region in Armenia settled in [[Valjevo]] (Tehlirians). Among the Tehlirians was [[Soghomon Tehlirian]]'s father.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=gpL9QKCJ2L8C&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=soghomon%20tehlirian%20tiflis&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=soghomon%20tehlirian%20tiflis&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; During the Second World War, many Armenians moved to [[North America]] and [[France]].

In the past, there used to be an Armenian Catholic church in [[Novi Sad]] (built in 1746, razed in 1963).

Some 500 female Serbian descendants of Armenians married Serbs in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="arhiva.glas-javnosti.rs"/&gt;

Armenia and Serbia established diplomatic relations in 1992. Armenia is represented in Serbia through its embassy in [[Athens]], [[Greece]].

[[File:Salle des Martyrs MEP.jpg|thumb|''Salle des Martyrs'' at the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]]. The ladder-like apparatus in the middle is the cangue that was worn by [[Pierre Borie]] in captivity.]]
A '''cangue''' ({{IPAc-en|k|æ|ŋ}}) or '''tcha''' is a device that was used for [[public humiliation]] and [[corporal punishment]] in [[China]]&lt;ref name="Jamyang Norbu"&gt;[[Jamyang Norbu]], [http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=24749 From Darkness to Dawn], site ''[[Phayul.com]]'', May 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cangue}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some other parts of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] until the early years of the twentieth century. It was also occasionally used for or during torture. Because it restricted a person's movements, it was common for people wearing cangues to starve to death as they were unable to feed themselves.

The word "cangue" is [[French language|French]], from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] "canga," which means [[yoke]], the carrying tool has also been used to the same effect, with the hands tied to each arm of the yoke. Frequently translated as '''[[pillory]]''', it was similar to that European punishment except that the board of the cangue was not fixed to a base and had to be carried around by the prisoner.&lt;ref name="Jamyang Norbu" /&gt;

==Forms==
Although there are many different forms, a typical cangue would consist of a large, heavy flat board with a hole in the center large enough for a person's neck.  The board consisted of two pieces.  These pieces were closed around a prisoner's neck, and then fastened shut along the edges by locks or hinges.  The opening in the center was large enough for the prisoner to breathe and eat, but not large enough for a head to slip through.  The prisoner was confined in the cangue for a period of time as a punishment. The size and especially weight were varied as a measure of severity of the punishment. The [[Great Ming Legal Code]] (大明律) published in 1397 specified that a cangue should be made from seasoned wood and weigh 25, 20 or 15 [[Catty|jīn]] (roughly 20–33&amp;nbsp;lb or 9–15&amp;nbsp;kg) depending on the nature of the crime involved. Often the cangue was large enough that the prisoner required assistance to eat or drink, as his hands could not reach his own mouth.

'''Cedara College of Agriculture''' is an agricultural college and research station near [[Howick, KwaZulu-Natal]], South Africa, founded partly by [[Thomas Robertson Sim]]. The foundation stone of the "School of Agriculture and Forestry" was laid on 28 April 1905. The original prospectus advertised lectures in Forestry, Horticulture, Dairying, Veterinary Science, Chemistry, Elementary Mathematics, Bookkeeping, Farm Surveying, Zoology and Fish Husbandry. Currently Cedara College offers a two-year Higher Certificate in Agriculture and a three-year Diploma in Agriculture where students are able to specialize in either Animal Production or Crop Production. It provides vocational training in cultivated pastures, dairying, pigs and fodder crops. 

A 60-ha area commonly known as "College Farm" has been set aside primarily for training students in animal husbandry and general farming practices.  A beef herd and a sheep flock are kept specifically to train students in aspects of basic veterinary techniques, beef management practices (dehorning, castration, identification) and sheep management practices (foot care, castration, tail docking, identification).  A small pig unit and small dairy is also kept for student training purposes.  A broiler and layer unit meet the demands of poultry production practicals.  The College also runs a small equine stud. A fully equipped laboratory is used for crop- and animal-related research.

The personal status code sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 years. However, since consensual sex outside of marriage is illegal, a legal guardian can ask local authorities to permit a girl younger than 18 to marry.&lt;ref name="girlsnotbrides.org"/&gt;

drug-related crimes, theft and homicide. In 1994, the number of arrested prisoners was recorded as 38,931; 20 years later, as of the beginning of October 2014, the number of prisoners has reached 152,335.

{{further|Women in Turkey#Crime against women}}

According to a study, some commonly-expressed views on rape were given to individuals from various professions, who were asked to agree or disagree; results recorded that 33% of the police officers agreed that "some women deserve rape", 66% of police officers, as well as nearly 50% of other professional groups except the psychologists about 18% and 27% of psychiatrists, suggested that "the physical appearance and behaviors of women tempt men to rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.highbeam.com/435388/article-1G1-111635867/turkish-university-students-attitudes-toward-rape |title=Turkish university students' attitudes toward rape. &amp;#124; HighBeam Business: Arrive Prepared |publisher=Business.highbeam.com |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that 'the rape and torture of Kurdish prisoners in Turkey are disturbingly commonplace'. According to a report from Amnesty International in 2003, Hamdiye Aslan, who accused of supporting the Kurdish separatist group had been detained in Mardin Prison, south-east Turkey, for almost three months in which she was reportedly blindfolded, anally raped with a truncheon, threatened and mocked by officers.&lt;ref name =gg&gt;{{cite web|author=Meral Duzgun |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/10/turkey-history-sexual-violence |title=Turkey: a history of sexual violence &amp;#124; Global Development Professionals Network &amp;#124; Guardian Professional |publisher=Theguardian.com |accessdate=2013-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Honour killing ====
{{further|Women in Turkey#Crime against women}}

A June 2008 report by the Turkish Prime Ministry's Human Rights Directorate said that in [[Istanbul]] alone there was one [[honor killing]] every week, and reported over 1,000 during the previous five years. It added that metropolitan cities were the location of many of these, due to growing immigration to these cities from the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=107834|title=Honor killings claim 1,000 lives in five years|publisher=''[[Turkish Daily News]]''|accessdate=2008-09-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120162848/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=107834|archivedate=2012-11-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009 a Turkish news agency reported that a 2-day-old boy who was born out of wedlock had been killed for honor. The maternal grandmother of the infant, along with six other persons, including a doctor who had reportedly accepted a bribe to not report the birth, were arrested. The grandmother is suspected of fatally suffocating the infant. The child's mother, 25, was also arrested; she stated that her family had made the decision to kill the child.&lt;ref&gt;'''(Fr)''' ''Le Monde'' (France), [http://www.lemonde.fr/europe/article/2010/04/16/un-bebe-de-2-jours-victime-d-un-crime-d-honneur-en-turquie_1335090_3214.html Un bébé de 2 jours victime d'un "crime d'honneur" en Turquie].

'''Danmarks Traktormuseum''' ("Denmark's Tractor Museum"; formerly '''Lolland-Falster Tractor and Engine Museum''') is located in [[Eskilstrup]] on the [[Denmark|Danish]] island of [[Falster]]. The [[tractor]] and [[Engine|motor]] [[museum]] is housed in a brick warehouse dating from 1918. It contains tractors and engines built between 1880-1960 by [[Bukh]], [[Ferguson Company |Ferguson]], [[Fiat#Agricultural and construction equipment |Fiat]], [[Ford]], and [[Volvo]].&lt;ref name="Publishing2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=DK Publishing|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Denmark|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itwH4I-iUVMC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=31 May 2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7566-7406-9|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum is owned by Guldborgsund Municipality. After the building sat vacant for some years, the municipality took it over in 1981 and in 1986 moved the Tractor and Engine Museum into it. The new museum was officially opened in 1988. The exhibition area covers about {{convert|2000|sqm}} over four floors of the old warehouse building, the three wooden floors supported by 24 columns;&lt;ref name="ALAM2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alam.org.uk/newsletters.html|title=Newsletters - Spring 2001 - A pilgrimge to the Lolland Falsters Tractor and Engine Museum|date=2001|work=PDF|publisher=The Association of Lecturers in Agricultural Machinery|pages=18|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a nearby workshop building. The museum building itself was completed in 1919 as a cleaning station for seeds. It was the first building on Falster to make use of [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref name=lf/&gt;

==Collections==
[[File:Bukh tractors.jpg|thumb|left|Bukh tracktors at the Danmarks Traktormuseum.]]
There are five major collections totalling around 100 tractors and a similar number of engines.  The tractor displays include a collection of 38 tractors from the brothers Bent and Knud Nielsen, who were farmers in the area.&lt;ref name="ALAM2001" /&gt;  There are over 200 tractors from the time of the tractor's invention and up until around 1970. There is an almost complete collection of the Danish Bukh tractors, including prototypes, special models and a comprehensive collection of photographs. In addition to the larger collections of Bolinder-Munktell, Volvo, [[International Harvester|International]] and Ferguson, there are also several individual rarities. A motor assembly displays almost 100 mainly stationary engines, such Bukh engines, a Holeby engine from 1898 and an International engine from 1925.&lt;ref name=lf&gt;[http://www.visitlolland-falster.com/international/en-gb/menu/turist/oplevelser/attraktioner/museer/produktside/gdk001324/denmarks-tractor-museum.htm?CallerUrl=1 "Denmarks tractor museum"], Lolland-Falster. Retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive library provides instructional and repair books and parts catalogs. A tool assembly showcases agriculture and motorized garden equipment. The Sigvardt collection includes components of [[Rasmus Sigvardt]] from nearby [[Orehoved]] who was a manufacturer of motors and motorized field and orchard sprayers. Aside from the tractors on display at the museum, there are about 85 tractors stored in three different farms. 

==Features==
The museum organizes an annual special exhibition. Past themes have includes "Rare tractors and tractor development" (2012), "Rare tractors" (2011), and "Swedish tractors" (2010) which was supplemented by tractors borrowed from a Swedish collector. The museum is open June to September from Tuesday to Sunday (10 am to 4 pm, weekends 10 am to 3 pm). In July and August it is also open on Mondays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traktormuseum.dk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60&amp;Itemid=70&amp;lang=en "Opening hours"], Danmarks Traktormuseum.

{{History of Ghana}}

'''Ghana''' was a [[dominion]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] between 6 March 1957 and 1 July 1960, before it became the [[Republic of Ghana]]. It was the first western African country to achieve independence.

British rule ended in 1957, when the [[Ghana Independence Act 1957]] transformed the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|British Crown Colony of the Gold Coast]] into the independent dominion of Ghana.&lt;ref name="Heads of State of Ghana (1957 - To Date)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.ghananation.com/articles/republic-of-ghana/3063-heads-of-state-of-ghana-1957-to-date.html|title=Heads of State of Ghana (1957 – To Date)|work=Ghananation.com  |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Queen Elizabeth II (1952 - )"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britroyals.com/kings.asp?id=elizabeth2|title=Queen Elizabeth II (1952 – ) |work=Britroyals.com |accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British monarch]] remained [[head of state]], and Ghana shared its Sovereign with the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The monarch's constitutional roles were mostly delegated to the [[List of Governors-General of Ghana|Governor-General of Ghana]]. The following governors-general held office:
#[[Charles Noble Arden-Clarke]] (6 March – 24 June 1957)
#[[William Francis Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel]] (24 June 1957 – 1 July 1960)

A [[Ghanaian constitutional referendum, 1960|referendum]] was held on 27 April 1960, with 88.47% percent of the voters favouring a republic, and 11.53% against. The republic was declared and the monarchy abolished on 1 July 1960.

Elizabeth II did not reside in or visit Ghana between 1957 and 1960, but she did visit:

*1961 (9–20 November): as [[Head of the Commonwealth]]
*1999 (7–9 November): as [[Head of the Commonwealth]]

[[Kwame Nkrumah]] held office as [[prime minister]] (and [[head of government]]). Following the abolition of the monarchy, Nkrumah won a presidential election and became the first [[President of Ghana]].

==Notable projects==

===Designing Futures, 2004–2008===
''Designing Futures'' was a project focused on the medium of fine wood, in response to the State Government’s newly instigated regulations to protect Western Australia’s old-growth forests.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Victoria (2007-08-17). 'Paving the Way for Creative Industries', The Australian, August 17, 2007.

Following these events, the focus of the project expanded to other craft mediums, providing professional development to ‘clusters’ of Western Australian craftmakers and designers, with the project culminating in the establishment of Midland Atelier in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie, Victoria (2007-08-17).

===Midland Atelier, 2008–2013===
Midland Atelier was established in 2008, at the [[Midland Railway Workshops]] in collaboration with the Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority (MRA). The MRA was keen to expand the existing wood studio in the site’s pattern shop, and worked with FORM to house a cluster of fine wood artists who had previously been participants in ''Designing Futures''.&lt;ref&gt;'Midland Atelier celebrates five years of creativity at The Workshops.'

The Atelier housed fine wood, furniture, jewellery, and photography studios over its lifetime, in addition to a number of exhibitions, events, and artists in residence.

===PUBLIC, 2014–2016===
PUBLIC was a three-year project that aimed to 'explore creativity as a catalyst for generating public good – for the wellbeing or benefit of society.'&lt;ref&gt;'PUBLIC'. FORM – Building a State of Creativity. Retrieved 23 October 2014. http://www.form.net.au/project/public/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the project comprised ''Art in the City'' (Western Australia’s first festival of street and wall-based art), ''Art in the Pilbara'' (a residency program for participating PUBLIC artists), and ''100 Hampton Road'' (a program of creative and professional development for the residents of a lodging house in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]]). The initial ''Art in the City'' festival in April 2014 included participation by 45 artists from around the world, who created 35 wall-based works across Perth’s CBD over 10 days. A satellite project ''Dear William, a dedication to William Street'' explored the history of an iconic street within the City of Vincent. In 2015 the project included a symposium on utilising creativity for the public good, and the project expanded to the Wheatbelt, completing large murals on CBH Avon grain silos. In 2016, PUBLIC included PUBLIC Campus at [[Curtin University]], as well as site specific programming in suburban Claremont and the [[Great Southern (Western Australia)|Great Southern region]].

=== The Goods Shed, 2016 + ===
In 2016, FORM opened a new cultural facility and visual arts project space in Claremont, Western Australia. In partnership with [[LandCorp]], FORM renovated the historic Goods Shed located adjacent to the Claremont Railway Station as an exhibition, residency, and event space. Concurrently FORM moved its offices to the Station Masters House on the opposite side of the railway station.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5954">'''Feminist urbanism''' is a theory and social movement concerning the impact of the built environment on women. Proponents of feminist urbanism advance a perspective that is critical of [[Patriarchy|partriachal]] political and social structures that they believe have negatively impacted women's lives and have limited female engagement in urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Contemporary_Urban_Planning.html|title=Contemporary Urban Planning|last=Levy|first=John|publisher=Rutledge Publishing|isbn=9780205851737|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist urbanism theorists view the urban built environment as fundamentally inhospitable to women.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, Margaret. "Introduction." ''Journal of Romance Studies'', vol. 7, no. 1, 2007, p. 1+. {{doi|10.3828/jrs.7.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the feminist urbanism movement supports strategies for empowering women to plan and develop the future urban environment according to the specific needs of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=Liz|last2=Rose|first2=Damaris|date=14 July 2010|title=Constructing gender, constructing the urban: A review of Anglo-American feminist urban geography|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0966369032000114000|journal=A Journal of Feminist Geography|volume=10|issue=3|pages=229-245|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Theory ==
As a reflection of the diversity of the field of urbanism, theories of feminist urbanism variously studies the impact of female exclusion from urban scholarship, in civic decision making processes, and in the design of urban spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/768489864|title=Urban affairs : back on the policy agenda|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|others=Andrew, Caroline., Graham, Katherine A., 1947-, Phillips, Susan D. (Susan Darling), 1954-|year=|isbn=9780773570146|location=Montreal, Quebec|pages=80|oclc=768489864}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists have researched and identified the historical exclusion of women from the fields of [[architecture]], [[Urban planning|urban planning,]] and [[civil engineering]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kuhlmann, D. (2014). ''Gender studies in architecture: space, power and difference''. Routledge. p. 5, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; In relation, historians have identified the lack of power and participatory inclusion of women in traditional western societies as being the root cause of these same inhospitable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Patricia. "The Social and the Poetic: Feminist Practices in Architecture 1970-2000." ''The Feminism and Visual Culture Reader''. Jones, Amelia, ed. Psychology Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Theorists have long studies intersections of behavior and environment and many notable theorists including [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Henri Lefebvre|Henre Lefebvre]] have argued that architecture both reflects and reinforces social norms and patterns of behavior. Lefebvre has gone so far as to argue that "everything is ontological" spatial and that physical spaces and their design play a role in constructing identity and ideas of self-hood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The theory of feminist urbanism is focused on the ideals of [[feminism]], a diverse field with multiple viewpoints. Feminist urban scholars have suggests that other related movements around improving conditions after [[racial segregation]] and more liberal [[radical planning]] do not necessarily account for all of the needs of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Melody|date=2008|title=The Role of Social Networks In  Making Housing Choices: The Experience of the Gautreaux Two Residential Mobility Program|url=|journal=Cityscape|volume=10|issue=1|pages=41–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some feminist scholars have criticized feminist urbanism as reinforcing gender stereotypes with respect to the urban environment particularly when planning for reconstructing urban spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Milward |first1=Kristy |last2=Mukhopadhyay |first2=Maitrayee |last3=Wong |first3=Frans |title=Gender Mainstreaming Critiques: Signposts or Dead Ends? |journal=Institute of Development Studies Bulletin |date=27 July 2015 |volume=46 |issue=4 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1759-5436.12160 |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Wiley Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crușmac |first1=Oana |title=Why Gender Mainstreaming is Not Enough?

The '''Gbe languages''' (pronounced {{IPA-ee|ɡbè|}})&lt;ref&gt;The {{angbr|gb}} is a [[voiced labial–velar stop]], common in many West African languages.&lt;/ref&gt; form a cluster of about twenty related [[language]]s stretching across the area between eastern [[Ghana]] and western [[Nigeria]]. The total number of speakers of Gbe languages is between four and eight million. The most widely spoken Gbe language is [[Ewe language|Ewe]] (3 million speakers in Ghana and [[Togo]]), followed by [[Fon language|Fon]] (1.7 million, mainly in [[Benin]]). The Gbe languages were traditionally placed in the [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] branch of the [[Niger–Congo languages]], but more recently have been classified as [[Volta–Niger languages]]. They include five major dialect clusters: [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Fon language|Fon]], [[Adja language|Aja]], [[Gen language|Gen]] (Mina), and [[Phla–Pherá languages|Phla–Pherá]].

Most of the Gbe peoples came from the east to their present dwelling-places in several migrations between the tenth and the fifteenth century. Some of the [[Phla–Pherá languages|Phla–Pherá]] peoples however are thought to be the original inhabitants of the area who have intermingled with the Gbe immigrants, and the Gen people probably originate from the [[Ga-Adangbe people]] in [[Ghana]]. In the late eighteenth century, many speakers of Gbe were enslaved and transported to the [[New World]]: it is believed that Gbe languages played some role in the genesis of several [[Caribbean]] [[creole language]]s, especially [[Haitian Creole]].

Around 1840, German missionaries started linguistic research into the Gbe languages. In the first half of the twentieth century, the Africanist [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann]] was one of the most prolific contributors to the study of Gbe. The first internal classification of the Gbe languages was published in 1988 by H.B. Capo, followed by a comparative [[phonology]] in 1991. The Gbe languages are [[tonal language|tonal]], [[Isolating language]]s and the basic word order is [[subject–verb–object]].

==Languages==

===Geography and demography===
The Gbe language area is bordered to the west and east by the [[Volta River]] in Ghana and the [[Weme River]] in Benin. The northern border is between 6 and 8 degrees [[latitude]] and the southern border is the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. The area is neighbored mainly by other [[Kwa languages]], except for the east and north-east, where [[Yorùbá language|Yorùbá]] is spoken. To the west, [[Ga–Dangme languages|Ga–Dangme]], [[Guang language|Guang]] and [[Akan language|Akan]] are spoken. To the north, it is bordered by [[Adele language|Adele]], [[Awuna|Aguna]], Akpafu, Lolobi, and Yorùbá.

Estimates of the total number of speakers of Gbe languages vary considerably. Capo (1988) gives a modest estimate of four million, while SIL's [[Ethnologue]] (15th edition, 2005) gives eight million&lt;!-- Note: number obtained by adding up speaker numbers of all individual Gbe languages --&gt;. The most widely spoken Gbe languages are Ewe ([[Ghana]] and [[Togo]]) and Fon ([[Benin]], eastern Togo) at four million and 3 million speakers, respectively. Ewe is a language of formal education for secondary schools and universities in Ghana, and is also used in non-formal education in [[Togo]]. In Benin, Aja (740,000 speakers) and Fon were two of the six national languages selected by the government for adult education in 1992.

===Classification===
[[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]], following Westermann (1952), placed the Gbe languages in the [[Kwa languages|Kwa]] family of the [[Niger–Congo languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1966), ''[[The Languages of Africa]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the Kwa branch has fluctuated through the years, and [[Roger Blench]] places the Gbe languages in a Volta–Niger branch with former East Kwa languages to their east.

Gbe is a [[dialect continuum]]. Based on comparative research, Capo (1988) divides it into five clusters, with each cluster consisting of several mutually intelligible dialects. The borders between the clusters are not always distinct. The five clusters are:&lt;ref&gt;Sources: for the classification, Capo (1991) &amp; Aboh (2004); for speaker numbers, [http://www.ethnologue.com Ethnologue, 15th edition].&lt;/ref&gt;

Angela Kluge (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/entry/41567|title=A sociolinguistic survey of the Gbe language communities of Benin and Togo: Gbe language family overview|author=|date=|website=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the Gbe languages consist of a [[dialect continuum]] that can be split into three large clusters.

*'''Western Gbe''' varieties ([[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Gen language|Gen]], and Northwestern Gbe): Adan, Agoi/Gliji, Agu, Anexo, Aveno, Awlan, Be, Gbin, [[Gen language|Gen]], Kpelen, Kpési, Togo, Vhlin, Vo, Waci, Wance, Wundi (also [[Aguna language|Awuna]]?)
*'''Central Gbe''' varieties: [[Aja language (Niger–Congo)|Aja]] (Dogbo, Hwe, Sikpi, Tado, Tala)
*'''Eastern Gbe''' varieties ([[Fon language|Fon]], Eastern [[Phla–Pherá languages|Phla–Pherá]], and Western [[Phla–Pherá languages|Phla–Pherá]]): Agbome, Ajra, [[Alada language|Alada]], Arohun, [[Ayizo language|Ayizo]], Ci, Daxe, [[Fon language|Fon]], Gbekon, Gbesi, Gbokpa, Gun, Kotafon, Kpase, Maxi, Movolo, [[Saxwe language|Saxwe]], Se, Seto, [[Tofin language|Tofin]], Toli, Weme, [[Pherá language|Xwela]], [[Phla language|Xwla]] (Eastern), [[Phla language|Xwla]] (Western) (also [[Wudu language|Wudu]]?)

===Naming===
The dialect continuum as a whole was called 'Ewe' by [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann|Westermann]], the most influential writer on the cluster, who used the term 'Standard Ewe' to refer to the written form of the language. Other writers have called the Gbe languages as a whole 'Aja', after the name of the local language of the Aja-Tado area in Benin. However, use of this single language's name for the language cluster as a whole was not only not acceptable to all speakers but also rather confusing. Since the establishment of a [[working group]] at the West African Languages Congress at [[Cotonou]] in 1980, H. B. Capo's name suggestion has been generally accepted: '' 'Gbe''', which is the word for 'language/dialect' in each of the languages.&lt;ref&gt;In daily use, individual Gbe languages are referred to by their speakers as X-gbe, e.g. ''Ewegbe'' for Ewe, ''Fongbe'' for Fon, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Before 1600===
[[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], settlement in present-day Benin Republic (formerly known as Dahomey), might be an appropriate starting point for a brief history of the Gbe-speaking peoples. Ewe traditions refer to Ketu as ''[[Amedzofe (history)|Amedzofe]]'' ("origin of humanity") or ''Mawufe'' ("home of the Supreme Being"). It is believed that the inhabitants of Ketu were pressed westward by a series of wars between the tenth and the thirteenth century. In Ketu, the ancestors of the Gbe-speaking peoples separated themselves from other refugees and began to establish their own identity.

Attacks between the thirteenth and the fifteenth century drove a large section of the group still further westward. They settled in the ancient kingdom of [[Tado (state)|Tado]] (also Stado or Stádó) on the Mono river (in present-day [[Togo]]). The Tado kingdom was an important state in [[West Africa]] up to the late fifteenth century.

In the course of the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the [[Notsé|Notsie]] (or Notsé, Notsye, Wancé) kingdom was established by emigrants from the Tado kingdom; Notsie would later (around 1500) become the home of another group of migrants from Tado, the [[Ewe people]]. Around 1550, emigrants from Tado established the [[Allada]] (or Alada) kingdom, which became the center of the [[Fon people]]. Tado is also the origin of the [[Aja people]]; in fact, the name Aja-Tado (Adja-Tado) is frequently used to refer to their language.

Other peoples that speak Gbe languages today are the [[Gen people]] (Mina, Ge) around [[Anexo]], who are probably of Ga and [[Fante people|Fante]] origin, and the [[Phla–Pherá languages|Phla and Pherá]] peoples, some of whom consist of the traditional inhabitants of the area intermingled with early migrants from Tado.&lt;ref&gt;Capo 1991:10; see also the section on linguistic diversity in [[Phla–Pherá languages#Linguistic diversity|Phla–Pherá languages]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===European traders and the transatlantic slave trade===
[[Image:Doctrina Christiana - Y explicacion de sus Misterios en nuestro idiom Español, y en lengua Arda (first page).png|thumb|right|300px|First page of the Spanish/Gen version of the 1658 ''Doctrina Christiana'']]
Little is known of the history of the Gbe languages during the time that only Portuguese, Dutch and Danish traders landed on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (roughly 1500 to 1650). The trade of mostly gold and agricultural goods did not exercise much influence on social and cultural structures of the time. No need was felt to investigate the indigenous languages and cultures; the languages generally used in trade at this time were [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Some [[loanword]]s remain from this period, for example ''atrapoe'', 'stairs'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page=603 |title=A Dictionary of the Asante and Fante Language Called Tshi (Chwee, Tw̌i): With a Grammatical Introduction and Appendices on the Geography of the Gold Coast and Other Subjects |author=Johann Gottlieb Christaller |publisher=Evangelical Missionary Society |year=1881 |via=New York Public Library, Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YV1GAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Dutch 'trap' and ''duku'' '(piece of) cloth' from Dutch 'doek' or Danish 'dug'. The few written accounts that stem from this period focus on trade. As more European countries established trade posts in the area, [[missionary|missionaries]] were sent out. As early as 1658, Spanish missionaries translated the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'' into the language of [[Allada]], making it one of the earliest texts in any West African language. The Gbe language used in this document is thought to be a somewhat mangled form of [[Gen language|Gen]].&lt;ref&gt;This catechism was reprinted in Labouret &amp; Rivet 1929, who also document the history of the Spanish mission in Allada or Arda.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively peaceful situation was profoundly changed with the rise of the [[slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]], which reached its peak in the late eighteenth century when as many as 15 000 slaves per year were exported from the area around Benin as part of a [[triangular trade]] between the European mainland, the west coast of Africa and the colonies of the [[New World]] (notably the Caribbean). The main actors in this process were [[Netherlands|Dutch]] (and to a lesser extent [[England|English]]) traders; captives were supplied mostly by cooperating coastal African states.

The [[Bight of Benin]], precisely the area where the Gbe languages are spoken, was one of the centers of the slave trade at the turn of the eighteenth century. The export of 5% of the population each year resulted in overall population decline. Moreover, since the majority of the exported captives were male, the slave trade led to an imbalance in the female/male ratio. In some parts of the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]] the ratio reached two adult women for every man. Several wars (sometimes deliberately provoked by European powers in order to [[divide and rule]]) further distorted social and economical relations in the area. The lack of earlier linguistic data makes it difficult to trace the inevitable linguistic changes that resulted from this turbulent period.

===Colonisation and onwards===
Around 1850, the transatlantic slave trade had virtually ceased. As the grip of European colonial powers strengthened, slave raiding became prohibited, trading focused on goods once more and the Europeans took it to be their calling to Christianize the colonized parts of Africa. In 1847 the Norddeutsche Missions-Gesellschaft (Bremen) started its work in [[Keta]].

In 1857, the first Ewe grammar, ''Schlüssel der Ewesprache, dargeboten in den Grammatischen Grundzügen des Anlodialekts'', was published by missionary [[J. B. Schlegel]] of the Bremen mission. Five different dialects of Gbe (at that time called the ''Ewé Language-Field'') were already distinguished by Schlegel, notes [[Robert Needham Cust]] in his ''Modern Languages of Africa'' (1883).&lt;ref&gt;Cust, ''The Modern Languages of Africa'', p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialects listed by Cust do not map exactly onto the five subgroups now distinguished by Capo, which is not too surprising since Cust himself admits that he relies on a multitude of often conflicting sources. Fon is in fact listed twice (once as 'the dialect of the province of Dahomé' and once as 'Fogbe').

Where previous literature consisted mostly of travel journals sometimes accompanied by short word lists, Schlegel's work marked the beginning of a period of prolific lexicographic and linguistic research into the various Gbe languages. Important writers of this period include [[Johann Gottlieb Christaller]] (''Die Volta-Sprachen-Gruppe'', 1888), [[Ernst Henrici]] (''Lehrbuch der Ephe-Sprache'', 1891, actually the first comparative Gbe grammar), J. Knüsli (''Ewe-German-English Vocabulary'', 1892) and [[Maurice Delafosse]] (''Manuel Dahoméen'' (Fon), 1894).

In 1902 the missionary [[Diedrich Hermann Westermann]] contributed an article titled "Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Yewe-Sprachen in Togo" to ''Zeitschrift für Afrikanische und Oceanische Sprachen''. Westermann became one of the most productive and influential writers on the Gbe languages, and his output dominated the Gbe literature and analysis of the first half of the twentieth century. He wrote mainly on the Western Gbe languages, especially on [[Ewe language|Ewe]] (though he often used the term 'Ewe' to denote the Gbe dialect continuum as a whole). Among his most important works on Ewe are his ''A Study of the Ewe language'' (1930) and ''Wörterbuch der Ewe-Sprache'' (1954).

From 1930 on, publications on various Gbe languages appeared rapidly, the vast majority of them dealing with individual Gbe languages. A significant exception is formed by the extensive [[comparative linguistics|comparative linguistic]] research of [[Hounkpati B Christophe Capo]], which resulted in an internal classification of the Gbe languages and a reconstruction of the proto-Gbe [[phonology]]. Much of the comparative research for Capo's classification of the Gbe languages was carried out in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the form of articles on specific [[phonology|phonological]] developments in various branches of Gbe and, notably, in the form of a unified standard orthography of Gbe. In his ''Renaissance du Gbe'' (1988), the internal classification of Gbe was published in full for the first time. In 1991, Capo published a comparative phonology of Gbe. In this period, Capo also initiated ''Labo Gbe (Int.)'', the 'Laboratory for research on Gbe languages', based in Benin, which has since fostered research and published several collections of papers on the Gbe languages.

In the early 1990s, [[SIL International]] initiated a study to assess which Gbe communities could benefit from existing [[literacy]] efforts and whether additional literacy campaigns in some of the remaining communities would be needed. Synchronised linguistic research carried out in the course of this study shed more light on the relations between the various varieties of Gbe.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the results of this study were presented in Kluge (2000, 2005, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the SIL studies corroborated many of Capo's findings and led to adjustment of some of his more tentative groupings.

''Notes''
*The apico-[[postalveolar consonant]]s are generally written and transcribed with the symbols for the corresponding alveolar consonants, except for the voiced stop, which uses the symbol for the voiced retroflex stop {{IPA|[ɖ]}}. This is only to distinguish it from the lamino-dental voiced stop, and is not to be interpreted as the consonant being [[Subapical consonant|subapical]].
*The above table lists the attested ''phonetic'' segments. Some of the sounds listed here are in [[free variation]] with other sounds (e.g. '''r''' and '''r̃''' with '''l''' and '''l̃'''). The reader is referred to the individual languages for an overview of their phoneme inventory.

No Gbe language exhibits all of the above forty-two phonetic segments. According to Capo (1991), all of them have the following twenty-three consonants in common: '''b, m, t, d, ɖ, n, k, g, kp, gb, ɲ, f, v, s, z, χ, ʁ, r, r̃, l, l̃, y, w'''.

===Vowels===
The following vowels are found in Gbe languages:

{| class="wikitable" 
|+ &lt;small&gt;Phonetic inventory of vowels in Gbe languages&lt;/small&gt;
!&lt;small&gt;Capo 1991:24&lt;/small&gt;!![[Front vowel|Front]]!![[Central vowel|Central]]!![[Back vowel|Back]]
|-
| style="text-align: right;"|[[Close vowel|Close]]||{{IPA|i • ĩ}}|| ||{{IPA|u • ũ}}
|-
| style="text-align: right;"|[[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]||{{IPA|e • ẽ}}|| ||{{IPA|o • õ}}

|-
| style="text-align: right;"|[[Open vowel|Open]]|| ||{{IPA|a • ã}}||
|}

In general, each Gbe variety makes use of a subset of twelve vowels, seven [[Oral vowel|oral]] and five [[Nasal vowel|nasalised]]. The vowels {{IPA|/i ĩ u ũ e o ɛ̃ ɔ ɔ̃ a ã/}} are attested in all Gbe languages.

Nasalization plays an important role in the vowel inventory: every vowel in the Gbe languages occurs in a non-nasalized and a nasalized form. Capo (1991) observes that the degree of nasality of nasal vowels is less when they occur after nasal consonants than after non-nasal ones.

===Nasalization in Gbe===
Capo (1981) has argued that nasalization in Gbe languages should be analyzed phonemically as a feature relevant to vowels and not to consonants.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Capo (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; This means that nasal vowels are distinct from oral vowels, while nasal and voiced oral stops are treated as predictable variants. For example, non-syllabic nasal consonants are always followed by a nasal vowel, and syllabic nasal consonants are analyzed as reduced forms of consonant–vowel syllables. This analysis is in line with reconstructions of the [[Protolanguage|proto]]-[[Volta–Congo languages|Volta–Congo]] language, for which similar proposals have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Stewart, John (1985) 'Nasality patterns in the Volta–Congo foot.' Paper presented at the Colloquium on African Linguistics, Leiden, Sept. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
The Gbe languages are [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]s. In general, they have three tone levels, High (H), Mid (M), and Low (L), of which the lower two are not phonemically contrastive. Thus, the basic tonemes of Gbe are 'High' and 'Non-High', where the High toneme may be realised as High or Rising and the Non-High toneme may be realised as Low or Mid. The tones of Gbe [[noun]]s are often affected by the [[consonant]] of the noun stem. The [[phonation|voicing]] of this consonant affects the realisation of the Non-High toneme roughly as follows: If the consonant is a voiced [[obstruent]], the Non-High toneme is realised as Low (è-ḏà 'snake') and if the consonant is a voiceless obstruent or a [[sonorant]], the Non-High toneme is realised as Mid (ām̲ē 'person', à-f̱ī 'mouse'). The consonants that induce tonal alternations in this way are sometimes called [[depressor consonant]]s.

===Morphology===
The basic [[syllable]] form of Gbe languages is commonly rendered (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; )(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; )V(C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ), meaning that there at least has to be a nucleus V, and that there are various possible configurations of consonants (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ₋&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ). The V position may be filled by any of the vowels or by a syllabic nasal. It is also the location of the tone. While virtually any consonant can occur in the C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  position, there exist several restrictions on the kind of consonants that can occur in the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  positions. In general, only [[liquid consonants]] may occur as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , while only nasals occur in the C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; position.

Most [[verb]]s in Gbe languages have one of the basic syllable forms. Gbe [[noun|nominals]] are generally preceded by a nominal prefix consisting of a vowel (cf. the Ewe word ''{{IPA|aɖú}}'', 'tooth'). The quality of this vowel is restricted to the subset of non-nasal vowels. In some cases the nominal prefix is reduced to [[schwa]] or lost: the word for 'fire' is ''izo'' in Phelá, ''{{IPA|ədʒo}}'' in Wací-Ewe and ''{{IPA|dʒo}}'' in Pecí-Ewe. The nominal prefix can be seen as a relic of a typical Niger–Congo [[noun class]] system.

The Gbe languages are [[isolating language]]s, and as such express many semantic features by lexical items. Of a more [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] nature are the commonly used [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] constructions. In contrast to [[Bantu languages]], a major branch of the Niger–Congo language family, Gbe languages have very little inflectional morphology. There is for example no subject–verb [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] whatsoever in Gbe, no [[gender (linguistics)|gender]] agreement, and no inflection of nouns for number. The Gbe languages make extensive use of a rich system of tense/aspect markers.

[[Reduplication]] is a morphological process in which the root or stem of a word, or part of it, is repeated. The Gbe languages, like most other [[Kwa languages]], make extensive use of reduplication in the formation of new words, especially in deriving nouns, adjectives and adverbs from verbs. Thus in Ewe, the verb ''lã́'', 'to cut', is nominalised by reduplication, yielding ''lãlã́'', 'the act of cutting'. Triplication is used to intensify the meaning of adjectives and adverbs, e.g. Ewe ''ko'' 'only' → ''kokooko'' 'only, only, only'.

==Grammar==
The basic word order of Gbe clauses is generally [[subject–verb–object]], except in the [[imperfective aspect|imperfective tense]] and some related constructions&lt;!-- Note: Cf. Aboh (2004) --&gt;. The Gbe languages, notably Ewe, Fon and Anlo, played a role in the genesis of several [[Caribbean]] creole languages—[[Haitian Creole]] for example is classifiable as having a [[French language|French]] vocabulary with the syntax of a Gbe language.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre (1985). A recent research project of the Leiden-based Research School [[CNWS]] on this topic concerns the relation between Gbe and [[Surinam]]ese creole languages. The project is titled ''A trans-Atlantic [[Sprachbund]]? The structural relationship between the Gbe-languages of West Africa and the Surinamese creole languages''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gbe languages do not have a marked distinction between tense and aspect. The only [[Grammatical tense|tense]] that is expressed by a simple morphological marker in Gbe languages is the ''future tense''. The future marker is ''ná'' or ''a'', as can be seen from the examples below.
Other tenses are arrived at by means of special time adverbs or by inference from the context, and this is where the tense/aspect distinction becomes blurred. For example, what is sometimes referred to as ''perfective aspect'' in Gbe blends with the notion of past tense since it expresses an event with a definite endpoint, ''located in the past'' (see example sentences below).
*{{IPA|ŋútsu á '''a''' ɸlè xéxí}} &amp;nbsp; (man &lt;small&gt;DET FUT&lt;/small&gt; buy umbrella) &amp;nbsp; ''the man will buy an umbrella'' &amp;nbsp; (Ewegbe, future marker)
*{{IPA|ŋútsu á ɸlè xéxí}} &amp;nbsp; (man &lt;small&gt;DET&lt;/small&gt; buy:&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt; umbrella) &amp;nbsp; ''the man bought an umbrella'' &amp;nbsp; (Ewegbe, perfective)

[[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], which is used to draw attention to a particular part of the utterance, to signify contrast or to emphasize something, is expressed in Gbe languages by leftward movement of the focused element and by way of a focus marker ''wɛ́'' (Gungbe, Fongbe), ''yé'' (Gengbe) or ''é'' (Ewegbe), suffixed to the focused element. 
*àxwé '''yé''' Kòfí tù &amp;nbsp; (house &lt;small&gt;FOC&lt;/small&gt; Kofi build:&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt;) &amp;nbsp; ''Kofi built A HOUSE'' &amp;nbsp; (Gengbe, focus) &lt;!-- Note: Source: Aboh (2004) --&gt;

[[Question]]s can be constructed in various ways in Gbe languages. A simple declarative sentence can be turned into an interrogative utterance by the use of the question marker ''à'' at the end of the sentence. Another way of forming questions is by using question words. These so-called ''question word questions'' are much akin to focus constructions in Gbe. The question word is found at the beginning of the sentence, as is the focus marker. The close relationship to focus is also clear from the fact that in Gbe, a sentence cannot contain a question word and a focused element simultaneously.
*{{IPA|Afua de Gɛ '''à'''?}} &amp;nbsp; (Afua reach:&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA|Gɛ}} &lt;small&gt;QUESTION&lt;/small&gt;) &amp;nbsp; ''Did Afua go to Accra?'' &amp;nbsp; (Ewegbe, question)
*{{IPA|'''étɛ́''' Sɛ́ná xìá?}} &amp;nbsp; (what Sena read:&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt;) &amp;nbsp; ''What did Sena read?'' (Gungbe, question word question) &lt;!-- Note: Source: Aboh (2004) --&gt;

[[Topic (linguistics)|Topicalization]], the signalling of the subject that is being talked about, is achieved in Gbe languages by the move of the topicalized element to the beginning of the sentence. In some Gbe languages, a topic marker is suffixed to the topicalized element. In other Gbe languages the topic has to be ''definite''. A topicalized element precedes the focused element in a sentence containing both.
*{{IPA|...ɖɔ̀ '''dàn ɔ́''', Kòfí wɛ̀ hùì}} &amp;nbsp; (that snake &lt;small&gt;DET&lt;/small&gt; Kofi &lt;small&gt;FOC&lt;/small&gt; kill:&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt;-it) &amp;nbsp; ''...that the snake, KOFI killed it'' &amp;nbsp; (Fongbe, topic) &lt;!-- Note: Source: Aboh (2004) --&gt;

[[Negation]] is expressed in various ways in the Gbe languages. In general, three methods of negation can be distinguished: Languages like Gungbe express negation by a preverbal marker ''má''; Fongbe-type languages express negation either like Gungbe, or with a sentence-final marker ''ã''; and languages like Ewegbe require both the preverbal marker ''mé'' and a sentence-final marker ''o''.

|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Gbe languages share an [[areal feature]] found in many languages of the Volta basin, the [[serial verb construction]]. This means that two or more verbs can be juxtaposed in one clause, sharing the same subject, lacking conjunctive markings, resulting in a meaning that expresses the consecutive or simultaneous aspect of the actions of the verbs. 
*{{IPA|Kofí '''trɔ dzo''' kpoo}} &amp;nbsp; (Kofi turn:&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt; leave:&lt;small&gt;PERF&lt;/small&gt; quietly) &amp;nbsp; ''Kofi turned and left quietly'' &amp;nbsp; (Ewegbe, serial verb construction)

[[File:KembataFamily.jpg|thumb|Kambaata mother with her children in front of their [[tukul]] in the [[Kembata Tembaro Zone]], [[Ethiopia]]]]
'''Kambaata''' is the name of the people who speak the [[Kambaata language]]. Their land is in southern Ethiopia.  It was a province of Ethiopia beginning in the early 15th century and ending in the mid-17th century; Ethiopian rule was once again established in the late 19th century under [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelik II]]. During this first period, Kambaata province was largely Christianized.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Braukämper, "Aspects of Religious Syncretism in Southern Ethiopia", in ''Journal of Religion in Africa'', 1992, p.197.&lt;/ref&gt;  The former province is contained within the contemporary [[Kembata Tembaro Zone]] of Ethiopia's [[SNNPR]].

According to the 2007 Ethiopian national census, this ethnic group has 630,236 members, of whom 90.89% live in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region. Almost one in five -- 18.5% -- live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=2007-census&gt;[http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf 2007 Ethiopian census, first draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214221803/http://www.csa.gov.et/pdf/Cen2007_firstdraft.pdf |date=14 February 2012 }}, Ethiopian Central Statistical Agency (accessed 6 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kambata People are one of the oldest ethnicities in Southern Ethiopia. They have many indigenous traditional foods, such as [[enset]], and many kinds of tubers, spices and vegetables; some of these are not familiar in other parts of Ethiopia. An important landmark to the Kambaata people is [[Mount Ambarcho]], where they sacrificed and celebrated in the past. The king and the god of Kambata lived there.{{Clarify|date=June 2011}}

King Dagoye was one of the rulers of the Kambata. He was from Oyata clan. His rules were very unbearable for the people who lived at that time. He put the rules which favours Oyata. Any Oyata clan had guarantee of getting new house and fertile land. The Contomas were those who were not from the clan of Oyata. They suffered a lot and used to give what they had including their houses and wives too. If an Oyata young person wants to marry he had to marry Oyata lady. There was much more connection with the rule of Dagoye with the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. Dagoye instituted the [[Gadaa]] system which has differences from the Gadaa system practiced by the Oromo.

The '''Komsomol direction''' (Комсомольская путёвка) or '''Komsomol travel ticket''' was a document of [[mobilization]] in the [[Soviet Union]] issued by a [[Komsomol]] committee to a Komsomol member which directed the member for temporary or permanent [[shock construction projects]] (udarnyie stroiki) or military service. Usually the Komsomol direction was associated with relocation to new, poorly settled remote locations: new construction sites ("Komsomol construction sites" (комсомольская стройка)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telegraf.com.ua/rossiya-i-sng/854392-lukashenko-po-komsomolskoy-putevke-na-komsomolskuyu-stroyku.html|title=Лукашенко: По комсомольской путевке - на комсомольскую стройку|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), army service, etc. The travel ticket appeared sometime after adaptation of the Soviet Labor Code as a type of organizational mobilization.

During the [[Tenth five-year plan (Soviet Union)|10th five-year plan]] with those travel tickets to the shock construction projects arrived over 500,000 young volunteers.&lt;ref name=volunteers&gt;Pastukhov, B.

"Smena" magazine #1311. January 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Komsomol organizations formed and directed 100 All-Union squads consisting of 80,000 people.&lt;ref name=volunteers/&gt;

At the construction sites travel tickets recipients were earning ''labor days'' ({{lang-ru|трудодни}}, [[:ru:трудодень|trudodni]])&lt;ref&gt;Lapenkov, A.

There is a small population of '''Germans in Kyrgyzstan'''.

==Migration history==
During the 1800s, groups of [[Mennonites]] from Germany [[Russian Mennonites|settled throughout the Russian Empire]]; they began to come to the territory which is today Kyrgyzstan in the late 19th century. Many other Germans were brought to the country forcibly, as part of the [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|Stalin-era internal deportations]].&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav040309.shtml|title=Kyrgyzstan: Exodus Over, Ethnic Germans Cling to Traditions|date=2009-04-03|accessdate=2010-04-13|periodical=EurasiaNet|last=Trilling|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet Census (1979)|1979 Soviet census]] showed 101,057 Germans in the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] (2.9% of the population), while the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 census]] showed 101,309 (2.4%).&lt;ref name="Census"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.stat.kg/stat.files/census.pdf|publisher=Национальный статистический комитет|publication-place=Kyrgyzstan|title=Итоги Первой национальной переписи населения Кыргызской Республики|year=1999|accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kyrgyzstan gained independence in 1991, there was a significant outflow of ethnic Germans to Germany, due to the relatively liberal [[German nationality law]] which granted citizenship to anyone with proof of German ancestry.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet"/&gt; A 1993 survey found that 85% of the Germans in Kyrgyzstan intended to emigrate; among those, the most popular destination by far was Germany (80%), with Russia running a distant second at 6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisfeld|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Kyrgyzstan's 1999 census, just 21,471 (0.4% of the population) remained.&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; German diplomatic officials in Kyrgyzstan were quoted in 2009 as stating that number has declined even further over the following decade, to perhaps just 10,000.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet"/&gt; This was supported by the 2009 census, which found just 9,487 Germans remaining (0.18% of the population).&lt;ref name="NewCensus"&gt;{{Citation|last= |first= |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=Population and Housing Census 2009.

Facing difficulties integrating Russian-speaking Germans from the [[post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]], the German government tightened their immigration requirements; furthermore, most ethnic Germans who hope to leave Kyrgyzstan have already done so. In 2007, only 196 Germans in Kyrgyzstan were granted immigration permits by the German embassy; that number fell further to 111 in 2008.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet"/&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
The first German settlements in Kyrgyzstan were near [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]]: Nikolaipol, Keppental, Gradental, Orlovka and Dmitrovskoye. In the late 1920s, they moved towards the [[Chuy Valley]], in the vicinity of Frunze (now [[Bishkek]]), where they established a number of new village-suburbs, including [[Bergtal]] (Rotfront), Fridenfeld, and Luxemburg.&lt;ref name="VV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferghana"/&gt; Others lived in [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]] and [[Tokmok]].&lt;ref name="VV"&gt;{{citation|url=http://eastime.ru/countries/analitic/?c=8&amp;r=1&amp;s=162 |periodical=Vremya Vostoka |date=2007-04-12 |accessdate=2010-04-13 |title=Немцы в Кыргызстане/Germans in Kyrgyzstan |last=Kandaurova |first=Yuliya |last2=Veytsel |first2=Roman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815101109/http://eastime.ru/countries/analitic/?c=8&amp;r=1&amp;s=162 |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the exodus of the 1990s, the German villages emptied out, and there are no longer any compact settlements of Germans in the country.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

==Language==
The ethnic Germans of Kyrgyzstan tend to trace their roots to western parts of Germany near the border with the [[Netherlands]], and as such tend to speak varieties of [[Low German]]. However, many youth show [[language shift]] towards Russian, which they use for communicating with peers of other ethnicities.&lt;ref name="EurasiaNet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferghana"&gt;{{citation|title=Кыргызстан: Немцы Джалалабада живут не без проблем, но с оптимизмом/Kyrgyzstan: the Germans of Jalalabad do not lack problems, but live with optimism|periodical=[[Ferghana Information Agency|Ferghana.ru]]|date=2008-06-05|url=http://www.ferghana.ru/article.php?id=5688|first=Minayim|last=Isabaeva}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a Bishkek branch of the [[Goethe-Institut]], which promotes German culture and the teaching of the German language; the local head of the Institut is herself an ethnic German born in Kyrgyzstan, who emigrated with her parents in 1978 but then returned to the country nearly three decades later to take up her present post.&lt;ref name="VV"/&gt; However, the study of the German language as a [[second language]] has been losing popularity even among ethnic German youth, as Chinese and English become of greater economic importance instead.&lt;ref name="DW"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,5299079,00.html|periodical=[[Deutsche Welle]]|title=В Бишкеке прошел четвертый съезд немецкой молодежи Киргизии/Fourth congress of German youth of Kyrgyzstan held in Bishkek|date=2010-02-28|accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
In the southern city of [[Jalal-Abad]], local ethnic Germans formed the Hope German Cultural Center  in 1996.&lt;ref name="Ferghana"/&gt; Four Congresses of German Youth of Kyrgyzstan (съезд немецкой молодежи Киргизии) have been held in the country; however, the most recent, in 2010, attracted only 50 participants. The government of Germany provides some monetary support to German organisations in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref name="DW"/&gt;

This is an alphabetical list of notable [[outlaw motorcycle club]]s, including those current, defunct, or historic. An outlaw motorcycle club is a [[motorcycle]] subculture that has its roots in the immediate post-World War II era of American society. It is generally centered on the use of [[power cruiser|cruiser]] motorcycles, particularly [[Harley-Davidson]]s and [[chopper (motorcycle)|choppers]], and a set of ideals that celebrate freedom, nonconformity to mainstream culture and loyalty to the biker group. In the United States, such [[motorcycle club]]s are considered "outlaw" as they are not sanctioned by the [[American Motorcyclist Association]] (AMA) and do not adhere to the AMA's rules.&lt;!-- Clubs on this list do not necessarily meet Wikipedia's criteria for having their own separate article, but they should have citations demonstrating notability beyond just having a web site.

[[:Category:Outlaw motorcycle clubs]] and the ''Outlaw Motorcycle Club'' navigation bar (at the bottom of this page) shows all the outlaw clubs that have their own Wikipedia articles. --&gt;
&lt;!--****************************************************************

Please do not add AMA, CMA, or FIM sanctioned motorcycle riding
clubs here, but rather add them to [[List of motorcycle clubs]],

groups/membership organizations.

Additions without verifiable, reliable sources will be deleted.
Additions must have some notability beyond just having their own

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3764">'''Līwa''' ({{lang-ar|ليوه}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''laywah'') is a traditional dance of [[African dance|African]] origin performed in [[Eastern Arabia]] ([[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]), mainly within communities of descendants of people from the [[Swahili Coast]] ([[Tanzania]] and [[Zanzibar]]). It is also performed by the African-descended [[Sheedi]] community, as well as the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] of [[Pakistan]]'s [[Makran Coast]] and [[Karachi]] area.

==Overview==
A large number of male participants arrange themselves into a circle, which is anchored by one or several drum players. A man paces in the middle of the group playing a simple reed instrument called ''[[Mizmar (instrument)|mizmar]]'' or ''[[surnai]]'', whose plaintive sharp sound reminds the listener of an [[oboe]]. The circle claps and dances in place, while individuals join a line which rhythmically paces around the inside of the circle. The Liwa is a more casual dance than the others, and can be performed with great spirit and banter from the young men who usually take part.

The three backing drums for this dance are the ''shindo'', the ''jabwah'', and the ''jasser''. More recently, a fourth drum—known as the Peeper—was added.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} This drummer plays a dominant role, which gives him plenty of opportunity for a virtuoso performance.

The ''mizmar'' has an oboe-like sound and produces a haunting melody, which is lent particular poignancy by the eastern [[tonic scale]] to which it is tuned. Like the oboe, it is made in two pieces, with a double reed fitted into the second piece. The best instruments these days are made of African [[hardwood]] in [[Mombassa]] and [[Dar Es Salaam]]. Their cost can be as high as $2,000.

The Liwa begins with a ''mizmar'' solo of about six minutes in slow tempo. The drums join in, followed by the ten dancers/singers, and gradually the pace increases to reach a spectacular swirl of activity. The whole dance takes about 25 minutes and both men and women can be involved in a performance.

The singing is always performed in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]—the native language of [[Tanzania]] and [[Zanzibar]]. These were both major trading partners with the [[Persian Gulf]] in centuries past, and have lent their language and culture to influence this fascinating dance.

It is especially performed on [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] and other celebrations.

The '''London Working Men's Association''' was an organisation established in [[London]] in 1836.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/21cc/struggle/chartists1/historicalsources/source3/lwma.html Minute Book of the London Working Men’s Association.] [[British Library]] 2011. Retrieved 19 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the foundations of [[Chartism]]. The founders were  [[William Lovett]], [[Francis Place]] and [[Henry Hetherington]]. They appealed to skilled workers rather than the mass of unskilled factory labourers. They were associated with [[Owenite]] socialism and the movement for general [[education]].

'''Louis O'Melville "Lou" Frost, Jr.''' (September 19, 1931 – January 16, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi "Frost, Louis O.] Rootsweb, Social Security Death Index&lt;/ref&gt; was an American lawyer who served for 36 years as the elected [[public defender]] for Florida's [[Fourth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida|Fourth Judicial Circuit]], which consists of [[Duval County, Florida|Duval]], [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau]], and [[Clay County, Florida|Clay]] counties. He was a local legal institution who nurtured the careers of hundreds of young lawyers,&lt;ref name=BIO&gt;Kerr, Jessie-Lynn: [http://news.jacksonville.com/justin/2008/01/16/lou-frost-1931-2008-longtime-former-public-defender-dies/ "Lou Frost 1931–2008: Longtime former public defender dies"]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Florida Times-Union'', January 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with two dozen appointed to state and federal judgeships, and one seated on the [[Florida Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=FREE&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Lou+Frost.-a0134676502 "Lou Frost"] ''Florida Bar News'', July 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Frost was born in [[New York City]], but his family moved to [[Jacksonville, Florida]] when he was seven years old. He was a 1949 graduate of Jacksonville's Landon High School, where he was named [[valedictorian]]. He received a degree in business from the [[University of Florida]] in 1953, the same year he married his wife, Shirley. He attended law school at the [[University of Miami]] before serving two years as an officer in the [[United States Army]] [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|First Infantry]] during the [[Korean War]]. After leaving the Army, he completed his law degree at the [[Fredric G. Levin College of Law|University of Florida College of Law]].&lt;ref name=OBIT /&gt;  He was admitted to the Florida Bar on November 6, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridabar.org/names.nsf/0/72E7FCD3E7DEB2AD85256A820080D762?OpenDocument "Louis O Frost, Jr."] Florida Bar website, Find a Lawyer&lt;/ref&gt; and worked briefly in a Jacksonville private practice.

==Career==
In 1959, then-[[Solicitor#United States|county solicitor]] Lacy Mahon Jr. hired Frost as a part-time prosecutor. After Edward M. Booth was elected County Solicitor, he retained Frost on the staff, as well as [[Ed Austin]]. Frost first became acquainted with Austin in 1951 at the University of Florida when the former was a student and the latter was a teacher. A few years later, Frost was a [[First Lieutenant]] at [[Fort Sill, Oklahoma]] when Austin attended [[Officer Candidate School (United States Army)|Officer Candidate School]]. They also attended law school together.&lt;ref name=OBIT /&gt;

In the 1963 ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that defendants charged with felonies (besides murder) were also entitled to legal representation by the State. In response, the Florida Legislature established the office of [[Public Defender]], and Governor [[Farris Bryant]] appointed Ed Austin as Jacksonville's first public defender.&lt;ref name=OBIT /&gt;&lt;ref name=JDR /&gt;

Austin asked Frost if he would be interested in changing sides. Frost said "yes" and he became Austin's chief assistant. Frost commented, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I never got a big bang out of putting people in jail. I always felt there was some good in every person – even though you had to find it in some of them. I also had prosecuted many people who didn’t have representation and I knew their sentences would have been more lenient if they could have had an attorney.&lt;ref name=JDR&gt;Marbut, Max: [http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=48291 "Lou Frost: There when it began"] ''Jax Daily Record'', August 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
During the 1960s, the [[State's Attorney|state attorney]] handled [[Capital punishment in Florida|capital cases]] and [[grand jury]] [[indictment]]s, while the county solicitor was responsible for all other cases. When Austin resigned to run for State Attorney in 1968, 
Frost was invited to change sides again, but he declined and was appointed to fill Austin's remaining term by Governor [[Claude Kirk]].&lt;ref name=BIO /&gt; Frost was elected public defender later that year and retained the post until he retired in January 2005, running unopposed 9 times. Frost explained how that happened: 
"I was a Democrat in the mostly Republican Fourth Judicial Circuit. When Don Brewer was the head of the Republican Party he told me I was doing a fine job and I would run unopposed."&lt;ref name=JDR /&gt;
 
Frost was also asked to help establish other public defender offices across the country.&lt;ref name=FREE /&gt;

==Personal==
Frost and his wife Shirley were married for 47 years and raised two children: Louis O. Frost IV and Deborah. He was a long-time member of [[Rotary International]], and served as president of the Arlington Rotary Club. He was also active with Jacksonville's [[Morocco Temple]], elected ''Illustrious Potentate'' in 1987,&lt;ref name=OBIT&gt;Pinkham, Paul: [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/011708/met_237288665.shtml "36 years as a public defender"] ''Florida Times-Union'', January 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Freemasonry|Master Mason]], 33rd degree [[Scottish Rite]], and a [[Royal Order of Jesters|Jester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/timesunion/obituary.aspx?n=Louis-Frost&amp;pid=101498444 "Louis O'Melville Frost Jr."] Legacy.com Obituaries&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Upon his retirement, Frost was interviewed by the ''[[Florida Times-Union]]'': "It has been rewarding to see people whose careers I've helped and also to see people that we've defended turn the corner and turn their lives around. Those are the rewards that you never see, and those are the rewards that I've cherished."&lt;ref name=BIO /&gt;

==Retirement==
Frost was diagnosed with stomach cancer and had surgery in March 2004 to remove an abdominal tumor, followed by 25 doses of [[chemotherapy]]. Before treatment, Frost had a slim body, and during chemo, his weight dropped to 105 pounds. He realized that he would not be able to return to work, and retirement was his only option. At his retirement party, delayed because of the cancer treatment, he commented,  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yes, it was difficult. The chemo really knocked me down, but I guess they almost have to kill you before you can start in your recovery. Everything is great, wonderful right now. I’m in remission and there have been no reoccurrences since my surgery. I’m blessed. I’m surrounded by the people I love.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, J. Brooks: [https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111437/http://174.142.88.186/showstory.php?Story_id=42393 "Lou Frost"] ''Financial News &amp; Daily Record'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
More than 300 friends and colleagues attended a retirement celebration in his honor on February 24, 2005. They included judges, lawyers and politicians in the northeast Florida legal community, many of whom offered speeches in tribute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaxdailyrecord.com/showstory.php?Story_id=42394 Legal community honors Lou Frost], ''Jax Daily Record'', February 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

State Attorney [[Harry Shorstein]] said, "Lou was your quintessential moral, ethical, caring person. The law can at times be very contentious, but Lou was always a gentleman."&lt;ref name=OBIT /&gt;

Chief Circuit Judge [[Donald Moran]] commented, "He was so well-respected throughout the state of Florida, not only for his civic work but as a lawyer. He was a humble person, a gentleman's gentleman."&lt;ref name=OBIT /&gt;

The cancer returned however, and four years after he was diagnosed, Frost died of complications after a long hospitalization.&lt;ref name=BIO /&gt;

==Honors==
In 1975, Frost was honored by the [[National Legal Aid &amp; Defender Association]] with their distinguished ''Reginald Heber Smith Award''.

He received the Mary L. Singleton Justice, Peace and Social Harmony Award in 2001, and the D.W. Perkins Bar Association recognized him in 2004 for his "trail-blazing" dedication to hiring African-American lawyers.&lt;ref name=OBIT /&gt;

In 2006, the Florida Public Defenders Association named him recipient of the ''L. Clayton Nance Award''. Frost commented, "It is a distinct honor to be recognized in the same group with former governors [[Farris Bryant]] and [[Leroy Collins]] and [[Supreme Court of Florida|State Supreme Court]] Justices (B. K.) Roberts and [[James C. Adkins|Adkins]] and [[Sandy D'Alemberte]]. It is overwhelming for me. To be listed among those people as worthy of this award is the pinnacle of my career."&lt;ref name=JDR /&gt;

That same year, the Criminal Law Section of [[The Florida Bar]] bestowed the Selig Goldin Award in recognition of his distinguished career.&lt;ref name=FREE /&gt;

The '''"Me" generation''' in the United States is a term referring to the [[baby boomers]] generation and the self-involved qualities that some people associate with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henderson|first1=Amy|title=When It Comes To the Baby Boomers, It Is Still All About "Me"|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/when-comes-baby-boomers-still-all-about-me-180953030/|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1970s  were dubbed the "Me" decade by writer [[Tom Wolfe]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/features/45938/index1.html|title=Tom Wolfe on the 'Me' Decade in America -- New York Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Lasch]] was another writer who commented on the rise of a culture of [[narcissism]] among the younger generation of that era.&lt;ref name="Land"&gt;{{cite book|last=Land|first=Gary|title=The Essentials of United States History: America Since 1941, Emergence as a World Power|year=1991|publisher=Research &amp; Education Association|isbn=978-0-87891-717-4|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase caught on with the general public, at a time when "self-realization" and "self-fulfillment" were becoming cultural aspirations to which young people supposedly ascribed higher importance than social responsibility.

==Origins==
 
[[File:JOGGING ALONG LAKE MICHIGAN IN EVANSTON. CRANE IN BACKGROUND IS REPAIRING STORM DAMAGE - NARA - 547074.jpg|thumb|[[Jogging]] and other health and diet trends went mainstream with the Me generation.]]
The cultural change in the United States during the 1970s that was experienced by the baby boomers is complex. The 1960s are remembered as a time of political protests, radical experimentation with new cultural experiences (the [[Sexual Revolution]], [[happenings]], mainstream awareness of Eastern religions). The [[Civil Rights Movement]] gave rebellious young people serious goals to work towards. Cultural experimentation was justified as being directed toward spiritual or intellectual enlightenment. The mid to late 1970s, in contrast, were a time of increased economic crisis and  disillusionment with idealistic politics among the young, particularly after the resignation of [[Richard Nixon]] and the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. Unapologetic [[hedonism]] became acceptable among the young, expressed in the [[Disco]] music popular at the time.

{{blockquote|The new introspectiveness announced the demise of an established set of traditional faiths centred on work and the postponement of gratification, and the emergence of a consumption-oriented lifestyle ethic centred on lived experience and the immediacy of daily lifestyle choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Binkley|first=Sam|title=Getting Loose: Lifestyle Consumption in The 1970s|year=2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-3989-2|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the mid-1970s, [[Tom Wolfe]] and [[Christopher Lasch]] were speaking out critically against the culture of narcissism.&lt;ref name="Land"/&gt; These criticisms were widely repeated throughout American popular media.

The development of a youth culture focusing so heavily on self-fulfillment was also perhaps a reaction against the traits that characterized the older generation, which had grown up during the [[Great Depression]]. That generation had learned values associated with self-sacrifice. The deprivations of the Depression had taught that generation to work hard, save money and not spend it; to cherish family and community ties. Loyalty to institutions, traditional religious faiths, and other common bonds were what that generation considered to be the cultural foundations of their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=James T.|title=Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945-1974|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-511797-4|pages=315, 328–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baby boomers gradually abandoned those values in large numbers, a development that was entrenched during the 1970s.

The 1970s have been described as a transitional era when the [[self-help]] of the 1960s became self-gratification, and eventually devolved into the selfishness of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c487w9PuJOgC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=me%20generation%201970s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQ96jRsp7SAhWqrFQKHSuMB-gQ6AEIKzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=me%20generation%201970s&amp;f=false|title=Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s|first=John Bassett|last=Mccleary|date=22 May 2013|publisher=Potter/TenSpeed/Harmony|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Lars Jacob et al &amp; fashions in San Diego 1971.jpg|thumb|Discos and nightclubbing became popular with Me generation singles during the 1970s.]]
Health and exercise fads, [[New Age]] spirituality such as [[Scientology]], [[disco]]s and [[hot tub]] parties, [[self-help]] programs such as EST ([[Erhard Seminars Training]]), and the growth of the self-help book industry became identified with the baby boomers during 1970s.  Human potential, emotional honesty, "finding yourself', and new therapies became hallmarks of the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUiwqYOTyCIC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=me%20generation%201970s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY6vmWtZ7SAhVP5WMKHbdtBrAQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=me%20generation%201970s&amp;f=false|title=In Therapy We Trust: America's Obsession with Self-fulfillment|first=Eva S.|last=Moskowitz|date=1 January 2001|publisher=JHU Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marketing of lifestyle products, eagerly consumed by baby boomers with [[disposable income]] during the 1970s, became an inescapable part of the culture. Revlon's marketing staff did research into young women's cultural values during the 1970s, and the research revealed that young women were striving to compete with men in the workplace and to express themselves as independent individuals. Revlon launched the "lifestyle" perfume ''Charlie'', with marketing aimed at glamorizing the values of the new 1970s woman, and it became the world's best-selling perfume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cant, M. C.,and  J. W. Strydom, C. J. Jooste|title=Marketing Management|year=2009|publisher=Juta and Company|isbn=978-0-7021-7188-8|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The introspection of the baby boomers and their focus on self-fulfillment has been examined in a serious light in pop culture. Films such as  ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' (1978), ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]'' (1979), ''[[Ordinary People]]'' (1980) and ''[[The Big Chill (film)|The Big Chill]]'' (1983)  brought the inner struggles of baby boomers to a wide audience. The self-absorbed side of 1970s life was given a sharp and sometimes poignant satirization in ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'' (1979). More acerbic lampooning came in ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'' (1975) and ''[[Private Benjamin (1980 film)|Private Benjamin]]'' (1980). The Me generation has also been satirized in retrospect, as the generation called "[[Generation X]]" reached adulthood, for example, in ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'' (1989). ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994) summed up the decade with Gump's cross-country [[jogging]] quest for meaning during the 1970s, complete with a [[tracksuit]], which was worn as much as a fashion statement as an athletic necessity during the era.

The satirization of the Me generation's me-first attitude perhaps reached its peak with the television sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]'', which did not include conscious moral development for its  baby boomer characters, rather the opposite. Nor did it have plots with lessons to teach its audience. It was a "show about nothing", and its creators held this position deliberately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dalton, Mary M.  |author2=Laura R. Linder |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Sitcom Reader: America Viewed And Skewed|year=2005|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-6570-7|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A persistent label==
[[File:Seattle - Pedestrians on First Avenue, 1975.gif|thumb|The Me generation, for the most part, embraced entertainment and consumer culture.]]
The term "Me generation" has persisted over the decades so is connected to the baby boomers generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennie Bristow |date= 2015|title=Baby Boomers and Generational Conflict |pages= |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|accessdate=24 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers, however, have also named the  [[Millennials]] the Me Generation or Generation Me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/24/millenials-time-magazine-generation-y/2678441/|title=Are Millennials really the 'Me' generation?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Elspeth Reeve in The Atlantic noted that narcissism is a symptom of youth in most generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/me-generation-time/315151/|title=Every Every Every Generation Has Been the Me Me Me Generation|first=Elspeth|last=Reeve|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s were also an era of rising unemployment among the young, continuing erosion of faith in conventional social institutions, and political and ideological aimlessness for many. This was the environment that precipitated gravitation toward [[Punk rock]] among America's disaffected young people. By 1980, when [[Ronald Reagan]] was elected President, a growing number of America's baby boomers had also begun turning toward conservative political and cultural priorities.

At the same time, the realities behind the label have not escaped notice. As Eastern religions and rituals such as [[yoga]] grew during the 1970s, at least one writer observed a [[New Age]] corruption of the popular understanding of "realization" taught by [[Neo-Vedanta|Neo-Vedantic]] practitioners, away from spiritual realization and towards "self-realization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Michelis|first=Elizabeth|title=A History of Modern Yoga: Patañjali and Western Esotericism|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-8772-8|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading edge of the baby boomers, who were [[counter-culture]] "[[hippies]]" and political activists during the 1960s, have been referred to sympathetically as the "Now generation", in contrast to the Me generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McCleary, John Bassett  |author2=Joan Jeffers McCleary |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia (And Phraseicon) of the 1960s and 1970s|year=2004|publisher=Random House Digital Inc.|isbn=978-1-58008-547-2|page=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mediterraneanism''' is an ideology that claims that there are distinctive characteristics that [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean cultures]] have in common.&lt;ref name="William Vernon Harris 2005. P. 1"&gt;William Vernon Harris. Rethinking The Mediterranean. Oxford, England, UK: Oxford University Press, 2005. P. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Giuseppe Sergi]] asserted that the [[Mediterranean race]] was "the greatest race...derived neither from the black nor white people...an autonomous stock in the human family."&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} [[Italian Fascism]] initially adhered strongly to a similar version of Mediterraneanism that claimed a bond existed between all Mediterranean cultures and [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean peoples]], often placing Mediterranean people and cultures above other cultures. This form of Mediterraneanism was in stark contrast to the then-popular [[Nordicist]] racial theory common in [[Northwestern Europe|Northwestern]], [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Northern Europe|Northern Europe]] which categorized South European or Mediterranean people as inferior to [[Nordic race|Nordic]] people.&lt;ref name=renaissance/&gt;

==History==
[[File:GSergi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giuseppe Sergi]]]]
Italian anthropologist [[Giuseppe Sergi]] claimed that the Mediterranean race was "the greatest race in the world". He defined it as "the finest brunet race which has appeared in Europe…derived neither from the black nor white peoples, but constitut[ing] an autonomous stock in the human family.".&lt;ref name="gillette"&gt;{{cite book|title=Racial Theories in Fascist Italy|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|author=Aaron Gillette}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24–27}} Sergi claimed that the Mediterranean Race probably historically spoke a Hamitic language related to the language of the prehistoric Egyptians, Iberians, and Libyans.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} Sergi noted that the Roman Empire led to the spread of Mediterranean civilization across Europe and thus contemporary European civilization was bound by ancestry to the Mediterranean race.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}}

Sergi rejected [[Nordicism]]'s claims of Nordic peoples being strongly Aryan, saying that Aryans were not Nordic in appearance.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} Instead he claimed that Nordics were "Aryanized Euroafricans", and that the Nordic race is related to Mediterranean race.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} Sergi responded to typical Nordicist claims of superiority of Nordics over Mediterraneans, by saying that the reason for the lack of wealth or progress in Latin countries as compared with countries of Northern Europe was because the Aryans of the North, including northern Italians, living in frigid climates had developed close-knit groups that allowed them to survive in that environment, as such they became more disciplined, productive civic-minded than southern Italians.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} Because of this, Sergi claimed that the northern Italians, whom he identified as having significant Aryan heritage, were more advanced than southern Italians.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} However Sergi rejected claims that Aryans who were a Euroasian people were responsible for founding Greco-Latin civilization. Sergi described the original Aryans in Europe in a negative manner: "The Aryans were savages when they invaded Europe: they destroyed in part the superior civilization of the Neolithic populations, and could not have created the Greco-Latin civilization".&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} Sergi claimed that the only contribution by the ancient Aryans to European civilization was Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} He claimed that the ancient Aryans interbred with the Mediterranean race north of the Po Valley but declined south of it and became insignificant south of Rome.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}}

Sergi claimed the Nordics had made no substantial contribution to pre-modern civilization, noting that "in the epoch of [[Tacitus]] the Germans ... remained barbarians as in prehistoric times".&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} He claimed that the Romans were unable to Romanize the Germans because the Germans were averse to the Romans' civilizing influence.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} He rejected Germanic scholars' claims that Germans were the saviors of a decadent post-Roman Italy.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}} Instead Sergi claimed that the Germans were responsible for bringing forward the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in the Medieval period and that the Germans of the Medieval period were known for "delinquency, vagabondage, and ferocity".&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|24–27}}
[[C. G. Seligman]] supported Mediterraneanist claims, stating "it must, I think, be recognized that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievement to its credit than any other, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilization, certainly before 1000 B.C. (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic [[Egyptians]], formed the basis of that of Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 54. (Jan. – Jun., 1924), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

French historian [[Fernand Braudel]] in the 1920s invoked the conception of the Mediterraneanism including claims of Mediterranean universalism to justify French colonialism in [[Algeria]].&lt;ref name="silverstein"&gt;Paul A. Silverstein. ''Algeria in France: Transpolitics, Race, and Nation''. P. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Braudel had entered his doctrinal studies in the 1920s at the precise time when the issue of Mediterranean unity was being fiercely debated.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt; Braudel supported the pro-unity argument.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt; The argument for Mediterranean unity justified French colonialism in Algeria and viewed the [[Berbers]] in a place of privilege amongst the peoples of Africa, as retainers of the lost Roman legacy in Africa.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt; It was claimed that if the Berbers could be culturally separated from the Arabo-Islamic surrounding culture, that the Berbers would become natural allies of the French through their Mediterranean heritage that would challenge anti-colonial sentiment.&lt;ref name="silverstein"/&gt;

==Italian Fascist conception==

[[File:Mussolini mezzobusto.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Benito Mussolini]] was initially a strong proponent of Mediterraneanism, however with the rise in influence of pro-Nordicist Nazism, he promoted Aryanism and recognized Italians as having Nordic-Mediterranean heritage.]]
At first, Italian Fascism promoted a variant of Mediterraneanism that, like Sergi's strain of Mediterraneanism, held that Mediterranean people and cultures shared a common historical and cultural bond. Initially, this variant mostly avoided explicit racial connotations; its followers often rejected biological racism and instead stressed the importance of the cultural aspects rather than the racial aspects of the Mediterranean peoples. Implicitly, however, this form of Mediterraneanism posited the [[Mediterranean race]] and Mediterranean cultures as superior to other groups, including the [[Northwestern Europe]]an, [[Germanic people|Germanic]], and [[Nordic race|Nordic people]], and it arose partially as a response to [[Nordicism]], a racial theory popular at the time among Northwestern European and Germanic racial theorists, as well as racial theorists of Northwestern European descent in countries such as the United States, that viewed non-Nordic people, including Italians and other Mediterranean people, as racially subordinate to the Nordic, Aryan, or Germanic peoples. &lt;ref name=renaissance&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=David|title=Hebraic Aspects of the Renaissance: Sources and Encounters|date=2011|publisher=Brill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwMGPYlnFeoC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq=italian+racial+laws+appease&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4Rv44f6Tqk&amp;sig=txXQUn1uAO-_3ywRcWayKzhOhEs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIg_etu5vKAhWIWxQKHeNsANUQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=italian%20racial%20laws%20appease&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Neocleous, Mark 1997. p. 35"&gt; Neocleous, Mark.

[[File:Mediterranean_race_Fischer_Lexikon.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Italian people|Italian]] man of Mediterranean type, from the ''Fischer Lexikon'' (1959)]]

In a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]], [[Benito Mussolini]] stated that "Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and Mediterranean race".&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|11}}&lt;ref name="Neocleous, Mark 1997. p. 35"/&gt; In this speech Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European Aryan race]], in the sense of people of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European heritage]] rather than in the more famous Nordicist sense that was promoted by the [[Nazis]].&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|39}} Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations, and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|39}} Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically "pure" races existed in modern times.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Glenda Sluga. ''The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border: Difference, Identity, and Sovereignty in Twentieth-Century''. SUNY Press, 2001. P. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;


Italian Fascism strongly rejected the [[Nordicism|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan race that idealized "pure" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as [[fair skin]], [[blond hair]] and [[blue eyes]], traits uncommon among Mediterranean and Italian people and the often [[olive skin|olive-skinned]] members of the so-called "[[Mediterranean race]]."&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|188}} The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of such theories by German and [[Anglo-Saxon]] Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|188}} Nordicism and biological racism were often considered incompatible with the early Italian fascist philosophy; Nordicism inherently subordinated Italians and other Mediterranean people beneath the Germans and Northwestern Europeans in its proposed racial hierarchy, and early Italian fascists, including Mussolini, often viewed race as a cultural and political invention rather than a biological reality or saw physical race as something that could be overcome through culture.&lt;ref name=renaissance/&gt; In a speech given in [[Bari]] in 1934, Mussolini reiterated his attitude toward Nordicism: "Thirty centuries of history allow us to look with supreme pity on certain doctrines which are preached beyond the [[Alps]] by the descendants of those who were illiterate when Rome had [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Virgil]] and [[Augustus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=[[Institute for Jewish Policy Research|Institute of Jewish Affairs]]| title = Hitler's ten-year war on the Jews| publisher=Kessinger Publishing| year = 2007| page = 283| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vCA4AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Thirty+centuries+of+history+allow+us+to+look+with+supreme+pity%22| isbn = 1-4325-9942-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi German influence and Nordicist Mediterraneanism===
From the late 1930s through [[World War II]], the Italian Fascists became divided in their stance on Mediterraneanism. Originally, Nazi-like Nordicist racial theories were found among only a very small number of fringe Italian Fascists, mostly [[Germanophile]]s, [[anti-Semite]]s, [[anti-intellectual]]s, and [[Northern Italians]] who regarded themselves to have Nordic or Germanic [[Lombards|Lombard]] racial heritage, and Nordicism and Nazi Aryanism remained at odds with Italian Fascist theories on the greatness of the Mediterranean people.&lt;ref name=renaissance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald R. Gems. Sport and the Shaping of Italian American Identity. Syracuse University Press, 2013. P57.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1938, as the alliance between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany became stronger, and as Nazi German policies and theories increasingly influenced Italian Fascist thought, many Italian Fascists began to embrace a new form of Mediterraneanism, a variant that mixed Nazi Nordicism with original Mediterraneanism. Unlike other forms of Mediterraneanism, this form based its racial view on Nazism and asserted that Italians were part of the "white race" or "white Aryan race" and utilized [[white supremacism]] to justify colonialism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Aristotle A. Kallis. ''Fascist Ideology: Expansionism in Italy and Germany 1922–1945''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2000. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, mere months before creating the [[Pact of Steel]] alliance with Nazi Germany, the Fascist government created the [[Italian Racial Laws]] and officially but gradually recognized and embraced the racial myth of Italians having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent. According to the ''Diary'' of [[Giuseppe Bottai]], in a meeting with Fascist Party members, Mussolini declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on [[Aryanism]].&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|188}} Both Italian historian [[Renzo De Felice]] in his book ''La storia degli ebrei italiani sotto il fascismo'' (1961) and [[William Shirer]] in ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]'' (1960) suggest that Mussolini enacted the Italian Racial Laws and turned towards Nazi racial theories partially to appease his Nazi German allies, rather than to satisfy a genuine anti-Semitic sentiment among the Italian people.&lt;ref name=renaissance/&gt; 

With the rise in influence of pro-Nordicist [[Nazi Germany]] in Europe, and as the Fascist Italian regime sought unity with Nazi Germany, the Fascist regime gave Italian Nordicists prominent positions in the National Fascist Party (PNF), which aggravated the original Mediterraneanists in the party.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|188, 168, 146}} Prominent Nordicists such as [[Julius Evola]] rejected Mediterraneanism and, in particular, Evola denounced Sergi's association of Europeans with Africans as "dangerous".&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|168}} Evola rejected biological determinism for race but was a supporter of spiritual Nordicism.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|168}} In direct contradiction of the earlier or original forms of Mediterraneanism that embraced the idea of a shared origin or culture among all people of the Mediterranean, the ''[[Manifesto of Race|Manifesto of Racial Scientists]]'' (1938) declared that Mediterranean Europeans were distinct from [[North Africa|Mediterranean Africans]] and [[West Asia|Mediterranean Asians]] and rejected claims that [[Mediterranean Europe|European Mediterraneans]] were related to the Mediterranean [[Semitic people|Semitic]] or [[Hamitic]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislao G. Pugliese. ''Fascism, Anti-Fascism, and the Resistance in Italy: 1919 To the Present''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2004. P. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1941, the PNF's Mediterraneanists, through the influence of [[Giacomo Acerbo]], put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|146}} However these efforts were challenged by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist [[Alberto Luchini]] as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested with Evola's spiritual Nordicism in late 1941.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist ''Manifesto of the Racial Scientists''.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|146}} The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group, and condemned the ''Manifesto'' for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the ''Manifesto'' "constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country".&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|146}} Furthermore, the Council denounced the ''Manifesto'' for "implicitly" crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the [[Lombards]] for having "a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance".&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|146}} The High Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the [[ancient Greeks]] and Romans in comparison with the ancient [[Germanic tribes]] made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Germans.&lt;ref name="gillette"/&gt;{{rp|146}}

The '''Meena''' ({{IPA-hns|miːɳaː|pron}}) is a tribe found mainly in the [[Rajasthan]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] regions of India. Its name is also transliterated as ''Meenanda'' or ''Mina''. The Meenas claim connection to the [[Matsya]] avatar of [[Vishnu]], and the ancient [[Matsya Kingdom]].

==History==

The word ''Meena'' is derived from ''Meen'', the Sanskrit word for ''fish'', and the Meenas claim a mythological descent from the Matsya avatar, or fish incarnation, of Vishnu.&lt;ref name="Kapur May 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Reconstructing Identities and Situating Themselves in History : A Note on the Meenas of Jaipur Region | last= Kapur | first= Nandini Sinha | date= May 2008 | publisher= d'échange bilatéral franco-indien durant le mois de mai 2008 | url= http://www.reseau-asie.com/cgi-bin/prog/pform.cgi?langue=en&amp;ID_document=2854&amp;TypeListe=showdoc&amp;Mcenter=agenda&amp;my_id_societe=1&amp;PRINTMcenter= | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110715174704/http://www.reseau-asie.com/cgi-bin/prog/pform.cgi?langue=en&amp;ID_document=2854&amp;TypeListe=showdoc&amp;Mcenter=agenda&amp;my_id_societe=1&amp;PRINTMcenter= | archivedate= 15 July 2011 | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Rajasthan| last=Sharma |first=Mathura Lal |year=1971 |page=191 |publisher=Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Govt. of India. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=TO56v-CMN_cC}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim to be descendants of the people of the Matsya Kingdom, which flourished in the 6th century B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qxxnZ4XxUbsC&amp;pg=PA12 |title=Tribal and Indigenous People of India: Problems and Prospects |publisher=APH Publishing |year=2002 |first1=Rabindra Nath |last1=Pati |first2=Jagannatha |last2=Dash |page=12 |ISBN=978-8-17648-322-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Pramod Kumar notes that it is likely that the tribes living in the ancient Matsya kingdom were called Meena but it cannot be said with certainty that there is anything common between them and the modern Meenas. They are considered to be [[adivasi]] (aboriginal people).&lt;ref name="Pramod_1984"/&gt;

The Meenas ruled at certain places in Rajasthan till they were overpowered by invading [[Rajput]]s. From Meenas the [[Bundi]] was captured by Rao Dewa (A.D. 1342), [[Dhundhar]] by [[Kachhwaha]] Rajputs and Chopoli fell to the [[Muslim]] rulers. [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Jhalawar]], [[Karauli]] and [[Jalore]] were the other areas of earlier Meena influence where they were forced to surrender ultimately.&lt;ref name="TribalCultures#1"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q29TcbHrMfUC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=meena+rulers&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj85I-rtbbKAhXNxY4KHcQDDSAQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=meena%20rulers&amp;f=false | title=Tribal Cultures and Change | publisher=Mittal Publications | author=Rann Singh Mann, K.

Nandini Sinha Kapur, a historian who has studied early India, notes that the oral traditions of the Meenas were developed from the early 19th century AD in an attempt to reconstruct their identity. She says of this process, which continued throughout the 20th century, that "The Minas try to furnish themselves a respectable present by giving themselves a ''glorious past''". In common with the people of countries such as [[Finland]] and [[Scotland]], the Meenas found it necessary to invent tradition through oral accounts, one of the primary uses of which is recognised by both historians and sociologists as being "social protest against injustices, exploitation and oppression, a ''raison d'être'' that helps to retrieve the image of a community." Kapur notes that the Meenas not merely lack a recorded history of their own but also have been depicted in a negative manner both by medieval [[Persian Empire|Persian]] accounts and records of the colonial period. From medieval times through to the [[British Raj]], references to the Meenas describe them as violent, plundering criminals and an anti-social ethnic [[tribal]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Minas: Seeking a Place in History |first=Nandini Sinha |last=Kapur |title=The Social and the Symbolic |editor-first=Bernard |editor-last=Bel |publisher=Sage |year=2007 |isbn=9780761934462 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGfjUNxrlckC&amp;pg=PA129 |pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British colonial period===
[[File:A Meena of Jajurh.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Meena of Jajurh]]

The Raj colonial administration came into existence in 1858, following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] which caused the government of Britain to decide that leaving colonial administration in the hands of the [[East India Company]] was a recipe for further discontent. In an attempt to create an orderly administration through a better understanding of the populace, the Raj authorities instituted various measures of classifying the people of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmyVKwxmeyUC |title=In quest of Indian folktales: Pandit Ram Gharib Chaube and William Crooke |first=Sadhana |last=Naithani |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-253-34544-8 |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such measure was the [[Criminal Tribes Act]] of 1871, under the provisions of which the Meenas were placed. The community remained stigmatised for many years, notably by influential officials of the Raj such as [[Herbert Hope Risley]] and [[Denzil Ibbetson]], and were sometimes categorised as [[animist]]s and as a [[hill tribe]] similar to the [[Bhil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Minas: Seeking a Place in History |first=Nandini Sinha |last=Kapur |title=The Social and the Symbolic |editor-first=Bernard |editor-last=Bel |publisher=Sage |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-76193-446-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGfjUNxrlckC&amp;pg=PA131 |page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meenas remained an officially designated [[Denotified tribes of India|criminal tribe]] until 1952, three years after the Act had been repealed. Mark Brown has examined the impact and issues of the Meena community during British rule and the change in their status from being a higher social group to a criminal tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Crime, Liberalism and Empire: Governing the Mina Tribe of Northern India |last=Brown |first=Mark |journal=Social and Legal Studies |year=2004 |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=191–218 |doi=10.1177/0964663904042551 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meena fall into the [[Scheduled Tribe]] category in the state of [[Rajasthan]] and the majority of them are classified as being Hindu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAE1UqAo3GoC&amp;pg=PA41 |title=Human Rights and Legal Pluralism |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |year=2011 |accessdate=2014-10-08 |first=Yüksel |last=Sezgin |page=41 |ISBN=978-3-64399-905-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in Madhya Pradesh Meena are recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in Sironj Tehsil, [[Vidisha]], while in the other 44 districts of the state they are categorised as [[Other Backward Classes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58G8PPAN48cC&amp;pg=PA35 |title=Awareness in Weaker Section: Perspective Development and Prospects |publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

In Rajasthan, the Meena caste members oppose the entry of [[Gurjar]]s into Scheduled Tribe fold, fearing that their own share of Scheduled Tribe reservation benefits will be eroded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2AsXFWT-CIC&amp;pg=PA96 |title=Ethics: Theory and Practice |publisher=Pearson Education India |author=Satyanarayana |year=2010 |page=96 |isbn=978-8-13172-947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They celebrate [[Meenesh Jayanti]] on the third day of the [[Chaitra]] month's [[Shukla paksha]].&lt;ref name="Kapur May 2008"/&gt;

==Subdivisions==

The Meena tribe is divided into several clans and sub-clans (''adakh''s), which are named after their ancestors. Some of the ''adakh''s include Ariat, Ahari, Katara, Kalsua, Kharadi, Damore, Ghoghra, Dali, Doma, Nanama, Dadore, Manaut, Charpota, Mahinda, Rana, Damia, Dadia, Parmar, Phargi, Bamna, Khat, Hurat, Hela, Bhagora, and Wagat.&lt;ref name="Pramod_1984"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dF-Iu2Pt3KQC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=Folk Icons and Rituals in Tribal Life |first=Pramod |last=Kumar |publisher=Abhinav |year=1984 |isbn=978-8-17017-185-0 |pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhil Meena]] is another sub-division among the Meenas. As part of a [[sanskritisation]] process, some [[Bhil people|Bhils]] present themselves as Meenas, who hold a higher socio-economic status compared to the Bhil tribal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lGyzY12uSr8C&amp;pg=PA127 |title=Tribal Culture, Continuity, and Change: A Study of Bhils in Rajasthan |first=Anita Srivastava |last=Majhi |publisher=Mittal |year=2010 |isbn=978-8-18324-298-1 |page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sub-group known as "Ujwal Meena" (also "Ujala Meena" or "[[Parihar]] Meena") seek higher status, and claim to be [[Rajput]]s, thus distinguishing themselves from the Bhil Meenas. They follow vegetarianism, unlike other Meenas whom they designated as "Mailay Meena".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kj583zZs2dMC&amp;pg=PA3 |title=A Study of Bundi School of Painting |first=Jiwan |last=Sodh |publisher=Abhinav |year=1999 |isbn=978-8-17017-347-2 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prevalent social groupings are Zamindar Meena and the Chaukidar Meena. The Zamindar Meena, comparatively well-off, are those who surrendered to powerful Rajput invaders and settled on the lands believe to be granted by the Rajputs. Those who did not surrender to Rajput rule and kept on waging guerrilla warfare are called the Chaukidar Meena.&lt;ref name="TribalCultures"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q29TcbHrMfUC&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Tribal Cultures and Change |publisher=Mittal Publications |first1=Rann Singh |last1=Mann |first2=K. |last2=Mann |year=1989 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minderico''', also known as ''Piação do Ninhou'' (the language of Minde), was originally a [[sociolect]] or a secret language spoken by textile producers and traders in the [[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesia]] ([[civil parish]]) of [[Minde (Alcanena)|Minde]] ([[Alcanena]], [[Portugal]]).

==History==
After this initial phase (18th century), Minderico began to expand its vocabulary continuously and creatively.  This expansion was (and continues to be) intimately related to the socio-cultural experiences of the inhabitants of Minde. For example, names and nicknames of well-known persons from Minde and the neighbouring areas were used as lexemes to express physical or psychological characteristics, as these characteristics were salient for those persons. This method of lexical formation can be explained by the fact that Minde, due to its geographical isolation, is a small and close knit community, where everyone knows one another. Therefore, using names of persons as a means to express the characteristics associated to them was immediately understood amongst members of the speech community; this was not an obstacle to effective communication.

The [http://www.cidles.eu Interdiciplinary Centre for Social and Language Documentation (CIDLes)], an institution dedicated to the research and documentation of endangered languages in Europe and the development of language technologies for lesser-used languages, is now working on the linguistic documentation of Minderico and, together with the speech community, on its revitalization.

'''Mortlockese''' ('''Kapsen Mwoshulók'''), also known as Mortlock or Nomoi,&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt; is a language that belongs to the [[Trukic languages|Chuukic group]] of  [[Micronesian languages]] in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] spoken primarily in the Mortlock Islands ([[Nomoi Islands|Nomoi (Lower Mortlock) Islands]] and the [[Upper Mortlock Islands]]).&lt;ref name="Odango"&gt;Odango, Emerson. 2015. [http://ling.hawaii.edu/wp-content/uploads/Dissertation_ODANGO-FINAL.pdf Afféú Fangani ‘Join Together’: A Morphophonemic Analysis Of Possessive Suffix Paradigms And A Discourse-Based Ethnography Of The Elicitation Session In Pakin Lukunosh Mortlockese]. University of Hawai'i at Mānoa Ph.D. dissertation.&lt;/ref&gt; It is nearly intelligible with [[Satawalese language|Satawalese]], with an 18 percent intelligibility and an 82 percent lexical similarity, and [[Puluwatese language|Puluwatese,]] with a 75 percent intelligibility and an 83 percent lexical similarity.&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt; The language today has become mutually intelligible with [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]], though marked with a distinct Mortlockese accent. Linguistic patterns show that Mortlockese is [[Language convergence|converging]] with Chuukese since Mortlockese now has an 80 to 85 percent lexical similarity.&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beyond the Reef"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Mac |title=Namoluk Beyond the Reef: The Transformation of a Micronesian Community |page=18 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=9780813341620 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are approximately five to seven thousand speakers of Mortlockese in the Mortlock Islands, [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], and the [[United States]]. There are at least eleven different dialects that show some sort of correspondence to the Mortlock Island groups. 

==Classification==
Mortlockese is an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language currently holding a 6b language status, meaning that it is threatened with extinction. More specifically, a language is given the 6b language status when it is only used for in-person communication (i.e., not written language), with a decline in the number of speakers.&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt; In the nuclear Micronesian languages, Mortlockese Language falls under the [[Chuukic languages|Chuukic]] category.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt; One factor contributing to the present endangerment of Mortlockese are natural disasters, such as the typhoon that struck the Mortlock Islands in 1907.&lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt; Such natural disasters kill many speakers of Mortlockese, and since the language is primarily transmitted orally, this removes many outlets for passing on the culture and language to youth.

==History==
[[File:Mortlock Islands 153.65366E 5.44213N.png|thumb|Image of Mortlock Islands taken by satellite]]The Mortlock islands, where Mortlockese is mainly spoken, is estimated to have had its first settlement around eight hundred to nine hundred years ago.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt; There is evidence showing that the Mortlockese Language originated from the [[Chuuk Lagoon]] since many Mortlock natives trace their history back to the Chuuk Lagoon islands. Along with the genealogies, many clans that exist in the Mortlock islands also exist in the Chuuk Lagoon islands.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt; In 1907, there was a typhoon that hit the Mortlock island Ta which caused the people there to move to [[Saipan]] and [[Pohnpei]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Now, Mortlockese Language speakers can be found not only on the Mortlock islands, but also on Saipan and Pohnpei.

Documenting the language by writing it down was uncommon; instead, stories were passed down orally, which leads to less available documented history. Children learned from their parents and the stories told by relatives. The main role of girls growing up was to help their mothers and learn household tasks. For the boys, more “masculine” tasks such as fishing were promoted. Family life was important, and obedience was widely accepted by children in fear of a supernatural power punishing them. Myths and folktales told stories of religious and cultural beliefs passed down. Family is important to the Mortlock natives. Family structure is important and different rules are followed depending on the different islands. In several cases, the woman is head of the family. Sleeping arrangements may mean men in large homes separate from the women and children. Friendships are also extremely important within the Mortlockese culture. Friendship was more of a “brotherhood.” It is noted that if a friendship was formed between two people, each of the other’s family members became family as well.

As early as January 1874, missionaries visited the islands and began building schools to teach the natives religious ways of life. Their main efforts were to increase awareness of [[Puritanism (disambiguation)|Puritanism]]. [[Europe|European]] clothes were introduced, as well as the prohibition of drugs and alcohol. There was concern of children in school falling out of touch with their native ways. The history and traditions of the Natives was approved and a new course was updated and continued for years. According to several documents, several changes to the curriculum were made to incorporate native traditions as well as to introduce new information from the Europeans.

The most common historical belief is that the Mortlock people arrived on the islands in canoes. Over the span of the 19th century, traders continued to document their visits to the islands allowing evidence of residency.

In 1907 a typhoon hit the Mortlock islands, destroying homes, and killing hundreds.&lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt; Unfortunately, natural disasters, war, and other changes to the islands are to blame for the little to no documentation of the Mortlock history and language. What is left is the writings of missionaries who visited the island to teach the word of God, and to translate the Mortlockese Language into biblical text. There are documents of what curriculum was taught in the schools opened, as well as the number of students and teachers present. There are also certain rules that are noted in several cases implying that words are not always what they seem. In terms of family and kinship, personal names were used when referring to family instead of terms like “cousin,” or “grandparent.” Kinship terms categorize relatives instead of label them directly. This is just one example of grammar we can study from the way the Mortlockese language is designed.

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:Federated States of Micronesia - Location Map (2013) - FSM - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|Map of the Federated States of Micronesia]]
The Mortlockese language is spoken in the [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] state.&lt;ref name="e19"/&gt; It is spoken in eleven distinct dialects over the eleven Mortlock Islands ([[Etal Atoll|Ettal]], Kutt, Lekinioch, [[Losap]], [[Moch, Chuuk|Moch]], Nama, [[Namoluk]], [[Oneop]], Piis-Emwar, [[Satawan|Satowan]], [[Ta (island)|Ta]]), all of which have mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt; Speakers of Mortlockese are able to discern where other speakers are from, whether a different island or a different village, based on nuanced variations in speech patterns.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt; There are approximately five to seven thousand speakers of the language, located mostly on the Mortlock Islands and throughout [[Micronesia]], but also on the Pacific Islands ([[Hawaii]] and [[Guam]] in particular) and in the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref name="Odango2015b"&gt;{{cite book|last=Odango |first=Emerson Lopez |editor=Farzana Gounder |title=Narrative and Identity Construction in the Pacific Islands |date=2015 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |isbn=978-90-272-6867-9 |chapter=Local ecological knowledge in Mortlockese narrative: Stance, identity, and knowing}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1907, in the wake of destruction caused by a typhoon that struck the Mortlock island Ta killing half the population there,&lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt; the Mortlock people living on that island relocated to [[Saipan]] and [[Pohnpei]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://www.pacificweb.org/DOCS/fsm/2000%20Chuuk%20Census/2000%20Chuuk%20Census%20Report_Final.pdf Chuuk State Census Report, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; On Pohnpei, the Mortlocks spoke one of three Mortlockese dialects along with [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]] or [[English language|English]] as a second language in the multilingual community they formed.&lt;ref name="Odango2015b" /&gt; After a number of years, Mortlockese people living in [[Pohnpei]] returned to [[Pakin Atoll]] in the Mortlock Islands, where they spoke the kapsen Mwoshulok dialect, exhibiting adaptation and evolution, while retaining [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]] as a second language.&lt;ref name="Odango2015b" /&gt; [[English language|English]] is the national language in the Mortlock islands; however, most only use it when interacting with people from other places or in school. Rather than [[English language|English]], Mortlockese and [[Pohnpeian language|Pohnpeian]] are the common spoken languages.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;
The Lukunosh dialect is one of the Southernmost Mortlockese dialects.

[[Gemination]] is possible for all consonants. (pg.98)&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;

Syllables are in the form of (C)(C)V(V)(C)(C), where (C) is an optional consonant and (V) is an optional vowel. An example of a CCVVCC syllable is ''so.ko.'''ppaat''''' (meaning assorted in Lukunosh Mortlockese). (pg.110)&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;


=== Reduplication ===
[[Reduplication]] occurs in some verbs to express extreme measure. It may also indicate an [[Imperfective aspect|imperfective]] or [[Habitual aspect|habitual]] aspect.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;

{| class="wikitable" 
|a. 
|/ŋiimw alɛɛtɛj/ - 'hate him/her/it'

|- 
|b. 
|/jææjæ/ - 'to use something' 
|/jæj~jææjæ/ - 'to use something repeatedly or habitually' 
|}

== Numbers and counting ==
The counting system in Mortlockese is a base 10 system. The following table includes the numbers used in serial counting, which can also be modified by numeral classifiers.

Table retrieved from p.50 of A preliminary survey of the economic and social life of the Mortlock Islands people &lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ward|first1=William Theophilus Thomas|title=A preliminary survey of the economic and social life of the Mortlock Islands people, Eastern Carolines, Trust Territory of Micronesia|date=1955|location=Hamilton Pacific, Hamilton Library University of Hawaii at Manoa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serial counting requires use of the prefix “e-” and use of any number with a classifier changes the word of “one” from “-e” to “-te.” &lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; Numeral classifiers are used to relate an object’s characteristics, and examples include “-man” for the counting of animate subjects, “-faú” for round-shaped objects, and “-shé” for objects that are long. Possessive classifiers are used to indicate the relationship between a number of objects and the possessor of the objects. &lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;

== Dialects ==
There are eleven different dialects in the Mortlockese Language and according to researchers, speakers of Mortlockese can tell the difference between the different Mortlockese dialects. Most of these differences are in how words sound and how the spellings of words differ.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;

==Grammar==
The different dialects of Mortlockese have varying degrees of place [[deixis]]. For example, Lukunosh Mortlockese as spoken in Pukin has four levels of diexis (near speaker, near listener, far from speaker and listener, in the minds of speaker and listener) while Kúttú Mortlockese has five levels.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;

In addition to common nouns and [[proper noun]]s are [[relational noun]]s, which are further divided into three categories: oblique, locational, and partitive.&lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

Subject markers help to interpret either anaphoric arguments or grammatical agreements. 
Object markers show the third person singular object suffix where there is an overt object. 
Both the third person singular object suffix and the other non third person singular object suffixes act as an anaphoric agreement when there is no overt object. 


=== Noun phrases ===
A noun phrase is at minimum a bare noun. This bare noun can then be modified by [[demonstratives]], [[Possessive determiner|possessive]], and [[Numeral classifiers|numeral]] classifiers. It is also possible to attach the stative [[Tense–aspect–mood|TAM]] marker /mii/ after a bare noun and then add an adjective. An example is /uuʃ/ 'banana' turning into  /uuʃ mii par/ 'red banana'. The structure of noun phrases generally follow the form: (Numeral) (possessive) (noun) (possessive suffix) (demonstrative suffix) (stative) (adjective). (pg.129)&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;

=== Verb phrases ===
Verb phrases follow the form (Proclitic prefix) (subject) (TAM marker) (optional adverb) (verb) (suffix) (directional suffix) (object or noun), giving Mortlockese an SVO sentence structure. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt; Subject pronouns used in the sentence are followed by an aspect morpheme, with only one aspect morpheme per clause. &lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt; The only preposition used in the Mortlockese language is /mɞ/. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

== Inclusive and exclusive pronouns ==
Mortlockese exhibits usage of inclusive pronouns such as the second-person plural word "aumi" which addresses a larger group than the individual with whom one is speaking to; the second-person singular "aumi" which involves just the speaker; the first-person plural exclusive "aimi", all of which can be translated to mean "you" but indicate different conditions of use.

== Nouns ==
Common or base nouns have no prefixes or suffixes and can be used with classifiers for counting. They can also be further categorized by possessive classifiers which indicate the relationship between the possessor and object as being indirect or alienable, and possessive suffixes are used to indicate direct or inalienable possession. Some nouns also indicate the specific use for the object in question, including the nature of how it is to be used by the subject in a sentence. Nouns can be modified by adjectives, demonstratives, and numeral classifiers and modified nouns will usually undergo vowel lengthening from (C)(V)(C) to (C)(V)(V)(C).
Types of nouns in Mortlockese include proper nouns, relational nouns (which cannot be modified and are used to indicate inalienable possession), oblique nouns, locational nouns, and partitive nouns. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

== Verbs ==

=== Intransitive verbs ===
[[Intransitive verbs]] in Mortlockese are described by two separate classes. The first class is “unaccusatives”, which are linked to adjectives and can show that the object is undergoing a process or action. The other class is “unergatives,” which are more like actual verbs in that they describe actions rather than a state of being. Both types of intransitive verbs have related transitive verb forms. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

=== Transitive verbs ===
[[Transitive verbs]] require the use of direct object suffixes which reference the object of the phrase. These include prepositional verbs, which are used with a direct object suffix and are not used with causitives or reduplication to indicate different aspects. Transitive verbs in Mortlockese can be used alone or as followed by a direct object noun phrase in a clause. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

== Adverbs ==
Adverbs can come before or after the verb in a sentence. Combining an adjective with the morpheme /lɛ/ and a verb will result in a form that roughly translates to the form of an English adverb ending with “-ly”. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

== Pronouns ==
Four types of pronouns are used in Mortlockese. The first type, independent pronouns, can be used either as the subject or direct object of a phrase or sentence. Different variations or forms may be used or preferred in the different dialects, but all of the forms are interchangeable. 
Subject proclitics are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the subject. An example of linguistic metathesis is shown in the variation of the third-person plural sunject proclitic pronoun /ɛr=/ to /rɛ=/ where the use of either is accepted, but an individual speaker will only choose to use one form.
Direct object suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of persons being talked about as the direct object of a phrase or sentence.
Lastly, possessive suffix pronouns are used to indicate the number of possessors and the relationship between the speaker and the possessor.
A verb can be combined with causative prefixes, transitive third-person direct object suffixes and thematic vowels (the inclusion of which depends on whether the ending of the verb is a vowel or a consonant) to create descriptive clauses that include pronouns. The different dialects will have different ways of modifying verbs and pronouns; likewise, generational differences yield different forms of word modifications. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;
Independent pronouns are used in response to WH questions. 
== Demonstratives ==
Singular and plural [[demonstratives]] are used to indicate proximity to the speaker or listener, and what number of objects there are. These words have the English equivalents of “this,” “that,” “here,” “there,” and the like. These can also be modified to indicate other qualities of the subject, such as in recalling something from the past that is not present with the speakers at the time they choose to discuss it. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

== Conjunctions ==
The two types of [[conjunctions]] in Mortlockese are subordinators and coordinators. &lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;
== Possessive classifiers ==
The [[Possessive determiner|possessive classifier]] acts as the base of the word, and indicates the relationship of the possessum noun to the possessor. The general possessive classifier in Lukunosh is [jaa-].

=== Possessive suffixes ===
{| class="wikitable"
|1SG

|-

| -mam
|-
|2PL
| -mi
|-
|3PL
| -r
|-
|CONST
| -n
|}
When attaching possessive suffixes to consonant-final words, a vowel is placed between the final consonant and the suffix. An example is [maas] (eye, face) becoming [masan] (their eye, face). The form [masn] is phonetically possible in Mortlockese, but is deemed impossible by speakers.&lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Certain words cannot be spoken in the presence of the opposite sex. This gender-restrictive vocabulary, sometimes called cookhouse speech, may only be used when speaking to people of the same gender.&lt;ref name="Odango" /&gt; This gender-restrictive vocabulary shows an example of avoidance speech, a type of [[Honorifics (linguistics)|honorific]], in the Mortlockese Language. Mortlockese is a matrilineal society, considering the patrilineal lineage as secondary. The Mortlockese vocabulary includes terms to denote siblings and cousins of the same gender, and different terms to refer siblings and cousins of the opposite gender. Verbs can be [[Transitive verb|transitive]], [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]](unergative or unaccusitive), or semitransitive.&lt;ref name="Odango"/&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to marketing:

'''[[Marketing]]''' &amp;ndash; social and managerial processes by which products, services, and value are exchanged in order to fulfill individuals' or groups' needs and wants. These processes include, but are not limited to, [[advertising]], [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]], and [[product management]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Core concepts in marketing==
Marketers may sell goods or services directly to consumers, known as business to customer (B2C marketing); [[Company|commercial organisations]] (known as [[Business-to-business|business to business marketing or B2B]]), [[Business-to-government|to government]]; to not-for-profit organisations ([[Nonprofit organization|Not-for-profit orgnanization (NFP)]]) or some combination of any of these.

===Actors and relationships===

: At the centre of the marketing framework is the [[consumer]] lies the relationship between the '''consumer''' and the '''organisation''' with the implication that marketers must manage the way the organisation presents its public face.

:: '''The [[consumer]]:''' Typically, the consumer refers to the [[end-user]] - but this may be an individual or group such as a [[household]], [[family]] unit or [[organisation]]. In addition, marketers may need to consider the roles of [[Influencer marketing|influencers]] such as [[Opinion leadership|Opinion leader]]s who increasingly use means such as [[social media]] to develop [[customer to customer]] networks of influence.

:: '''The organisation:''' may be represented by many different actors including: various ''sales personnel'': [[Law of agency|Agent]]; [[Broker]]; [[Sales|Sales representative]]; [[Merchant]]; [[Retail]]er; [[Street vendor]] or [[Vendor]]

:''Selling situations &amp; relationships'': Depending on the nature of the business operations, many different types of actors are involved in a variety of selling situations involving a variety of sales personnel, who perform varied sales roles. Sales activities involve many different types of customer relationships - from simple [[Financial transaction|transactional exchange]] through to long-term, enduring [[Customer relationship management|customer relationships]].

===Needs, wants and demands===

Marketers typically begin planning with a detailed understanding of customer needs and wants. 
: A [[need]] is something required for a healthy life (e.g. food, water, shelter); A [[want]] is a desire, wish or aspiration; When needs or wants are backed by [[purchasing power]], they have the potential to become [[demand]]s.

===Nature of exchange===
[[Exchange (economics)|Exchange]], the act of giving or taking one thing of value in return for another is central to marketing activities. Not all exchange involves [[Financial transaction]]s, but may also involve [[barter]], contra dealing or other form of [[trade]]. The object of exchange can include: [[Goods]]; [[Service (economics)|services]] or [[Experiential marketing|experiences]]; [[concept]]s or [[idea]]s; [[Cause marketing|causes]] and may even involve [[Celebrity branding|celebrity marketing]]

===Perceptions of value===
{{See|Customer value proposition}}
: Traditional thinking around the concept of [[Value (marketing)|value]] was that marketers created value through [[innovation]], [[product design]] and manufacture and that [[Utility]] was embedded in products or services offered for sale. In this type of thinking, marketer's objective was to communicate a [[value proposition]] to potential buyers. However, [[Service-dominant logic|recent thinking]] has changed the traditional perspective and now recognises that consumers may participate in the [[Co-creation|co-creation of value]] in a variety of ways. Consumers may derive value through usage and experience, known as [[value-in-use]] or may be involved in product design, known as [[participatory design]].

==Foundation economic concepts==
Given that marketing has its roots in economics, it shares many foundation concepts with that discipline. Most practicing marketers will have a working knowledge of basic economic concepts and theories.

;Competitive advantages &amp; comparative advantages
Businesses seek to compete by achieving [[competitive advantage]]s or [[comparative advantage]]s. Competitive advantages often focus on reducing costs through achieving one or more of the following: [[Economies of scope]]; [[Economies of scale]]; [[Experience curve effects|Experience effects]]; [[First-mover advantage]]s. Alternatively a business may seek to develop develop uniqueness through [[product differentiation]] or developing unique [[Core competency|competencies]] such as market sensing, rapid market response or delivering superior [[Value (economics)|customer value]].
superior value.

;Competition:types
Different types of competitive markets can be identified: [[Duopoly]]; [[Monopoly]]; [[Monopolistic competition]]; [[Imperfect competition]]; [[Oligopoly]]

;Demand
Understanding [[Supply and demand|demand and supply]] is essential for determining market size and market potential as well as in the price-setting function.

: The basic ''mechanics'' of [[Demand|consumer demand]] include:  [[Demand curve]]; [[Demand-led growth]]; [[Demand response]]; [[Law of demand]]; [[Law of supply]]; [[Transaction costs]].
: Different ''types of demand'' functions include: [[Derived demand]]; [[Inverse demand function]].

;Economic systems
In Western economies, the [[Capitalism|capitalist economy]] dominates. However, other types of economic systems such as [[barter]] economies and the [[Sharing economy]] can be identified.

==Planning levels and planning tools ==

===Planning levels ===

Marketing planning is just one facet of the overall company's planning. [[Marketing plan]]s must therefore take their guidance from the overall strategic plan or [[business plan]]. Most companies produce both a strategic plan and a managerial plan (also known as an operational plan). The distinction between strategic planning and management planning is that they are two phases with different goals.

: [[Strategic planning]] is fundamentally concerned with the policies that will improve the firm's [[Competitive advantage|competitive position]]. Strategic planning is sometimes called higher-order planning and is usually long-term planning (say 3–7 years) while management planning is short-term and may be carried out for a specific program (e.g. a sales or advertising campaign of a few weeks duration) or carried out annually. Strategic plans typically include a statement of the firm's [[Vision statement|vision]] and [[Mission statement|mission]]. The [[Marketing strategy]] is a plan that shows how the firm's marketing activities will help to achieve the overall strategic goals.

: [[Marketing management]] is focused on developing the marketing program or [[Marketing mix]] (also known as the ''4Ps'') and is concerned with the implementation of specific action plans designed to achieve objective, measurable targets ([[SMART criteria|SMART objectives]]). Marketing management plans are typically prepared on an annual planning cycle, but may be prepared for shorter periods for special events such as a product launch, a new logo, change to corporate livery or a repositioning campaign.

===Strategic planning tools and techniques===

Strategic planning requires sophisticated research and analysis to document the firm's current situation as well as to identify opportunities with the potential to be developed.

====Strategic research methods====
Strategic research is primarily concerned with the identification of new business opportunities and threats, which derive from the external operating environment. Accordingly, strategic analysts rely less on traditional [[market research]] methods. Instead, they use methods such as: [[Environmental scanning]];&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, L., King, W. R. and Narayanan, V. K., "Environmental scanning and forecasting in strategic planning—The state of the art," ''Long Range Planning,'' Vol. 14, No. 1, 1981, pp. 32–39&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marketing intelligence]] (also known as [[competitive intelligence]])&lt;ref&gt;Fleisher, C. and Bensoussan, B.

====Strategic analysis methods====

Marketers draw on a very wide variety of techniques and tools when analysing the market and the broader operating conditions. The technique selected depends on the nature of the situation or problem to be investigated and the analyst's skill and experience. Strategic analysts employ some 200 different quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques including:&lt;ref&gt;Fleitcher, C. and Bensoussan, B., ''Strategic and Competitive Analysis: Methods and Techniques for Analyzing Business Competition,'' Prentice Hall, NJ  Prentice Hall, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implementation and control ===

[[Implementation and control]] and control is an important feature of the planning process. From time to time, marketers will use appropriate [[Marketing performance measurement|measures of performance]] to gauge whether plans are achieving the desired results. If necessary, corrective action can be taken to get back on track.

== Branches of Marketing ==

The book titled, ''The Marketing Book,'' 7th ed., Routledge, Oxon, UK, 2016 edited by Michael J. Baker and Susan Hart identifies the distinct branches of marketing practice as:

* Consumer marketing (general [[Marketing]])
* [[Business marketing]]; also known as [[Business-to-business]] marketing and [[Industrial marketing]] (which also includes [[Business-to-government|Business-to-government marketing]])
* Relationship marketing
* [[Environmental marketing]]; also known as [[Green marketing]] )
* [[International marketing]]; also known as [[Global marketing]])
* [[Services marketing]]; which includes not-for-profit marketing and [[Destination marketing]]) 
* [[Retail]]ing 
* [[Social marketing]] (which includes  [[Cause-related marketing]])

For a more detailed breakdown of the relevant topics for each of these key branches of marketing, see [[Outline of marketing#Branches of Marketing: Detailed topics|Branches of Marketing: Detailed Topics]] on this page. For special applications of marketing including marketing of specific types of products (e.g. agricultural marketing, faith based marketing, pharmaceutical marketing, political marketing, sports marketing, etc.,) or marketing to specific target groups (e.g. marketing to children, marketing to older people, LBGT marketing) see: [[Outline of marketing#Special applications of marketing and promotion|Special applications of marketing practice]]).

==Marketing orientations==

Marketing orientations are the philosophies or mindsets that guide and shape marketing planning and marketing practice. Some marketing historians believe that different [[History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice|philosophies have informed marketing practice]] at different times in marketing's history. Although there is no real agreement amongst scholars about the precise nature or number of distinct marketing orientations, the most commonly cited include:

* [[Marketing orientation]] (See section: [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]])
** [[Marketing concept]]
* [[Production orientation]] (also see sections: [[History of marketing#Production orientation|Production orientation]] or [[Marketing#Production orientation|Production orientation]])

A number of commercial companies provide such data which typically includes proprietary software designed to interrogate the data and backed by algorithms that support different types of segmentation approaches. These commercial databases are often country or region specific.
Popular geo-demographic segmentation databases include:

===New product development (NPD)===
{{main|New product development}}

[[Innovation]] and [[New product development]] are an important part of a firm's long term growth strategy.

The steps in a basic new production development process are:

:[[Creativity|Idea generation]] (or [[Ideation (creative process)]]) →Concept screening→ [[Concept testing]] → [[Business analysis]] → [[Design|Product development]] → [[Test market|Market testing]] → [[Commercialization]] and may include a [[Soft launch]]

The NPD process can be applied to:

:Products: [[New product development]]; [[Design]]
:Services: [[Service innovation]]; [[Service design]] 
:Environmental goods or services: [[Eco-innovation]]; [[Ecodesign]]; [[Lean product development]]

A recent trend in NPD is the use of [[participatory design]], also known as co-design or co-operative design, which involves stakeholders such as employees or consumers in the design process.

Sources of new product ideas include: [[Research and development]]; [[User innovation|Consumers or Users]]; distributors, suppliers or [[crowdsourcing]].

'''Types of innovation'''
*[[Blue Ocean Strategy]]
*[[Disruptive innovation]]

NPD represents a high risk activity. It requires substantial investment and a [[list of product failures]] suggests that the probability of failure is relatively high.

'''New product adoption and diffusion'''

In order to develop a superior understanding of how new products are adopted by the market place and the factors that influence adoption rates, marketers often turn to a number of models or theories of the adoption/diffusion process:

*[[Bass diffusion model]]
*[[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]] (article)
*[[Diffusion of innovations]] (article) 
**[[Early adopter]] 
**[[Hype cycle]]
*[[Technology acceptance model]] (article)
*[[Technology adoption life cycle]] (article)
*[[Technology life cycle]]
*[[Quality function deployment]]
*''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'' (Book title)

===Legal protection of new products and brands===

New product development, including the design of product features, manufacturing processes, packaging design etc. involves [[creative work]] and therefore constitutes [[intellectual property]]. A number of different legal avenues are available to protect different types of intellectual property.

*[[Certification mark]]
*[[Copyright]]
**[[List of Copyright Acts]]

{{contains Perso-Arabic text}}

The '''Pahlavi dynasty''' ({{lang-fa|دودمان پهلوی}}) was the ruling house of the '''Imperial state of Iran''' from 1925 until 1979, when the [[Monarchy of Iran|2,500 years of continuous Persian monarchy]] was overthrown and abolished as a result of the [[Iranian Revolution]]. The dynasty was founded by [[Rezā Shāh|Reza Shah Pahlavi]] in 1925, a former brigadier-general of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], whose reign lasted until 1941 when he was forced to abdicate by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]], the last [[Shah of Iran]].

The Pahlavis came to power after [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last ruler of the [[Qajar dynasty]], proved unable to stop British and Soviet encroachment on Iranian sovereignty, had his position extremely weakened by a military coup, and was removed from power by the parliament while in France. The National Senate, known as the ''[[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]'', convening as a [[Constituent Assembly]] on 12 December 1925, deposed the young Ahmad Shah Qajar, and declared Reza Khan the new King (''Shah'') of the '''Imperial State of Persia'''. In 1935, [[Reza Shah]] asked foreign delegates to use the [[endonym]] [[Name of Iran|Iran]] in formal correspondence and the official name the '''Imperial State of Iran''' ({{lang-fa|کشور شاهنشاهی ایران}} ''Keshvar-e Shâhanshâhi-ye Irân'') was adopted.

Following the [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|''coup d'état'']] in 1953 supported by United Kingdom and the United States, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule became more autocratic and was aligned with the [[Western Bloc]] during the [[Cold War]]. Faced with growing public discontent and popular rebellion throughout 1978 and after declaring surrender and officially resigning, the second Pahlavi went into exile with his family in January 1979, sparking a series of events that quickly led to the [[Iranian Revolution|end]] of the state and the beginning of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 11 February 1979, officially ending [[Monarchy of Iran|the 2,500-year-old Persian monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |title=Iran marks Islamic Republic Day |publisher=Press TV |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=21 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922151735/http://www.presstv.com/detail/2013/04/01/295997/iran-marks-islamic-republic-day/ |archivedate=22 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The Pahlavi dynasty was an Iranian royal dynasty of [[Mazandarani people|Mazandarani]] ethnicity .The Pahlavi dynasty originated in [[Mazandaran province]]. In 1878 Reza Shah Pahlavi was born into Major  family of Abbas Ali Khan and Noushafarin Ayromlou at the village of [[Alasht]] located in [[Savadkuh County]], [[Māzandarān Province]].&lt;ref name="Afkhami2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gholam Reza Afkhami|title=The Life and Times of the Shah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTVSPmyvtkAC&amp;pg=PP2|accessdate=2 November 2012|date=27 October 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25328-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zirinsky|first=Michael P.|title=Imperial power and dictatorship: Britain and the rise of Reza Shah, 1921-1926|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|year=1992|volume=24|pages=639–663|url=http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&amp;context=history_facpubs&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fstart%3D20%26q%3Dlife%2Bof%2Bshah%2Bmohammed%2Breza%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0%2C5#search=%22life%20shah%20mohammed%20reza%22|accessdate=2 November 2012|doi=10.1017/s0020743800022388}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a Muslim immigrant from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote="(..)

[[File:Persia 1921.JPG|thumb|left|Persia on the eve of Reza Pahlavi's coup]]

In 1925, Reza Khan, a former Brigadier-General of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade]], deposed the [[Qajar dynasty]] and declared himself king ([[shah]]), adopting the dynastic name of ''Pahlavi'', which recalls the [[Pahlavi language|Middle Persian]] language of the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Ansari2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ansari|first=Ali M.|title=Modern Iran Since 1921: The Pahlavis and After|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3koQLfiTkJkC&amp;pg=PA36|accessdate=14 February 2016|year=2003|publisher=Longman|isbn=978-0-582-35685-6|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s, Rezā Shāh's strong secular rule caused dissatisfaction among some groups, particularly the clergy, who opposed his reforms, but the middle and upper-middle class of Iran liked what Rezā Shāh did. In 1935, Rezā Shāh issued a decree asking foreign delegates to use the term Iran in formal correspondence, in accordance with the fact that "[[Persia]]" was a term used by Western peoples for the country called "Iran" in Persian. His successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, announced in 1959 that both Persia and Iran were acceptable and could be used interchangeably.

Reza Shah tried to avoid involvement with the UK and the [[Soviet Union]]. Though many of his development projects required foreign technical expertise, he avoided awarding contracts to British and Soviet companies because of dissatisfaction during the Qajar Dynasty between Persia, the UK, and the Soviets. Although the UK, through its ownership of the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]], controlled all of Iran's oil resources, Rezā Shāh preferred to obtain technical assistance from Germany, France, Italy and other European countries. This created problems for Iran after 1939, when Germany and Britain became enemies in [[World War II]]. Reza Shah proclaimed Iran as a [[neutral country]], but Britain insisted that German engineers and technicians in Iran were spies with missions to [[sabotage]] British oil facilities in southwestern Iran. Britain demanded that Iran expel all German citizens, but Rezā Shāh refused, claiming this would adversely affect his development projects.

=== World War II ===
{{History of Iran}}
{{Main|Invasion of Iran (1941)}}

On 13 September 1943 the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] reassured the Iranians that all foreign troops would leave by 2 March 1946.&lt;ref name=Jessup&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jessup |first1=John E. |title=A Chronology of Conflict and Resolution, 1945–1985 |year=1989 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=New York |isbn=0-313-24308-5 |page= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[Tudeh Party of Iran]], a [[communist party]] that was already influential and had parliamentary representation, was becoming increasingly militant, especially in the North. This promoted actions from the side of the government, including attempts of the Iranian armed forces to restore order in the Northern provinces. While the Tudeh headquarters in [[Tehran]] were occupied and the [[Isfahan]] branch crushed, the Soviet troops present in the Northern parts of the country prevented the Iranian forces from entering. Thus, by November 1945 [[Azerbaijan People's Government|Azerbaijan]] had become an autonomous state helped by the Tudeh party.&lt;ref name="Jessup" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Iranian Crisis of 1945–1946 and the Spiral Model of International Conflict'', by Fred H. Lawson in ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' p.9&lt;/ref&gt; This puppet government of the Soviet Union only lasted until November 1946.

=== Cold War ===
{{further|Mohammad Reza Pahlavi}}
[[File:Mohammad Pahlavi Coronation.jpg|thumb|Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his wife [[Farah Pahlavi|Farah Diba]] upon his coronation as the [[Shah|Shâhanshâh]] of Iran. His wife was crowned as the [[Shahbanu]] of Iran.]]
[[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] replaced his father on the throne on 16 September 1941. He wanted to continue the reform policies of his father, but a contest for control of the government soon erupted between him and an older professional politician, the nationalistic [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]].

In 1951, the ''Majlis'' (the [[Parliament of the Islamic Republic of Iran|Parliament of Iran]]) named [[Mohammad Mossadegh]] as new prime minister by a vote of 79–12, who shortly after nationalized the British-owned oil industry (see [[Abadan Crisis]]). Mossadegh was opposed by the Shah who feared a resulting oil embargo imposed by the West would leave Iran in economic ruin. The Shah fled Iran but returned when the United Kingdom and the United States staged a coup against Mossadegh in August 1953 (see [[Operation Ajax]]). Mossadegh was then arrested by pro-Shah army forces.

Major plans to build Iran's infrastructure were undertaken, a new middle class began flourishing and in less than two decades Iran became the indisputable major economic and military power of the Middle East.

=== Collapse of the dynasty ===
{{Main|Iranian Revolution}}
[[File:Shah and Farah.jpg|thumb|The Shah and his wife left Iran on 16 January 1979.]]
[[File:ShahVaRohanioon1.jpg|thumb|The last [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] meets clergy. Some of Iranian clergy opposed him while some others supported him as "The only Shiite ruler".{{CN|date=March 2018}}]]

The Shah's government suppressed its opponents with the help of Iran's security and intelligence secret police, [[SAVAK]]. Such opponents included leftists and Islamists.

By the mid-1970s, relying on increased oil revenues, Mohammad Reza began a series of even more ambitious and bolder plans for the progress of his country and the march toward the "[[White Revolution]]". But his socioeconomic advances increasingly irritated the clergy. Islamic leaders, particularly the exiled cleric [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]], were able to focus this discontent with an ideology tied to Islamic principles that called for the overthrow of the Shah and the return to Islamic traditions, called the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution]]. The Pahlavi regime collapsed following widespread uprisings in 1978 and 1979. The Islamic Revolution dissolved the SAVAK and replaced it with the [[SAVAMA]]. It was run after the revolution, according to U.S. sources and Iranian exile sources in the US and in Paris, by Gen. [[Hossein Fardoust]], who was deputy chief of SAVAK under Mohammad Reza's reign, and a friend from boyhood of the deposed monarch.

Mohammad Reza fled the country, seeking medical treatment in [[Egypt]], Mexico, the United States, and Panama, and finally resettled with his family in Egypt as a guest of [[Anwar Sadat]]. On his death, his son [[Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran|Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi]] succeeded him ''[[wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' as heir apparent to the Pahlavi dynasty. Reza Pahlavi and his wife live in the United States in [[Potomac, Maryland]], with three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washdiplomat.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9475&amp;Itemid=437 |title=

== Legacy ==
Under the [[Qajar dynasty]] the Persian character of Iran was not very explicit. Although the country was referred to as Persia by westerners, and the dominant language in court and administration was [[Persian language|Persian]] the dichotomy between pure Persian and [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] elements had remained obvious until 1925.&lt;!--Leave this redirect for now, as it may be more correct to refer to [[Western Persian]]--&gt; The Pahlavi rule was instrumental in Iran's nationalisation in line with Persian culture and language which, amongst other ways, was achieved through the official ban on the use minority languages such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and successful suppression of separatist movements. [[Reza Shah|Reza Pahlavi]] is credited for [[Sheikh Khazal rebellion|reunification of Iran]] under a powerful central government. The use of minority languages in schools and newspapers was not tolerated. The succeeding regime&amp;nbsp;– [[the Islamic Republic of Iran]]&amp;nbsp;– has adopted a more inclusive approach in relation to the use of ethnic minorities and their language, however the issues as to [[Azerbaijani people|Azeris]], the Iran's largest ethnic minority, remain and pose considerable challenges for the unity and territorial integrity of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tohidi|first=Nayereh|title=Iran: regionalism, ethnicity and democracy|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy-irandemocracy/regionalism_3695.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of titles ==
*Shah: Emperor, followed by Shahanshah of Iran, with style ''His Imperial Majesty''
*[[Shahbanu]]: Shahbanu or Empress, followed by first name, followed by "of Iran", with style ''Her Imperial Majesty''
*Valiahd: Crown Prince of Iran, with style ''His Imperial Highness''
*Younger sons: Prince (Shahpur, or King's Son), followed by first name and surname (Pahlavi), and style ''His Imperial Highness''.
*Daughters: Princess (Shahdokht, or King's Daughter), followed by first name and surname (Pahlavi), and style ''Her Imperial Highness''.
*Children of the monarch's daughter/s use another version of Prince (Vala Gohar) or Princess (Vala Gohari), which indicate descent in the second generation through the female line, and use the styles ''His Highness'' or ''Her Highness''. This is then followed by first name and father's surname, whether he was royal or a commoner. However, the children by the last Shah's sister Fatemeh, who married an American businessman as her first husband, are surnamed Pahlavi Hillyer and do not use any titles.

As [[Manouchehr Ganji |Ganji]] writes, the group submitted at least 30 solid reports within 13 years on a corruption of high-ranking officials and the royal circle, but Shah called the reports "false rumors and fabrications". [[Parviz Sabeti]], a high-ranking official of [[SAVAK]] believed that the one important reason for success of regime's opposition is corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Ganji, p. 8-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFParklet.jpg|thumb|right|A parklet on [[Valencia Street]] in [[San Francisco]].]] 
A '''parklet''' is a [[sidewalk]] extension that provides more space and amenities for people using the [[street]]. Usually parklets are installed on parking lanes and use several [[parking space]]s. Parklets typically extend out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space.&lt;ref name=Parklet_Manual /&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin" /&gt;

Parklets are intended for people. Parklets offer a place to stop, to sit, and to [[leisure|rest]] while taking in the activities of the street. In instances where a parklet is not intended to accommodate people, it may provide greenery, [[art]], or some other visual amenity. A parklet may accommodate [[bicycle parking]] within it, or bicycle parking may be associated with it.&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abad Ocubillo|first=Robin|title=Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government|year=2012|publisher=University of Southern California|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll3/id/89034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parklet may be thought of as permanent, but must be designed for quick and easy removal for [[emergency|emergencies]] or other reasons such as [[snow removal]] without damage to the [[curb (road)|curb]] or street. As initially conceived, a parklet is always [[public accommodation|open to the public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org |title=Pavement to Parks |publisher=Sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some cities have allowed restaurants to create parklets that are not open to the public such as Long Beach, California, Fargo, North Dakota and Montreal, Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Long Beach|title=Long Beach’s Very Own Retro Row is Home to the 1st Parklet in Southern California No. 9 Restaurant Also Participating in the City Pilot Program|url=http://www.longbeach.gov/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=5648&amp;TargetID=55|work=City of Long Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UCLA Complete Streets Initiative|title=Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A Toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets|year=2012|publisher=UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs|location=Los Angeles, CA|url=http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parklettoolkit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[San Francisco]] has been credited with introducing the first parklet.&lt;ref name="ames"&gt;{{cite news |last= Grunewald |first=Katie |url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/article_d8fd6008-adf7-11e2-96a3-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Student Society of Landscape Architecture demonstrates parklet |publisher=Iowa State Daily |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, parklets have been introduced in cities such as [[Ames, Iowa]]&lt;ref name="ames"/&gt; and [[Puebla de Zaragoza]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inaugura Puebla Capital y Colegio de Arquitectos el concepto Parklets |url= http://www.cmicpuebla.org.mx/secciones/?se=1375|newspaper=Milenio| language=Spanish| accessdate= 2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world’s first formal public parklets were initially conceived by Italian/Brazilian designer and London resident Suzi Bolognese (Sb Design Studio) and installed in San Francisco in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://inhabitat.com/sao-paulo-replaces-parking-spots-with-mini-parklets-for-a-more-pedestrian-friendly-urban-environment/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In August 2012, the School of Architecture at University of Southern California published a graduate thesis "Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government," which provided a comprehensive history of the creation of parklet and plaza programs in four California cities.&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin" /&gt; In September 2012, the [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]] published a report, "Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets", examining case studies for parklets in seven cities across North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Complete Streets Initiative Releases Guide to Creating 'Parklets' | date=6 September 2012 | url= http://luskin.ucla.edu/news/school-public-affairs/complete-streets-initiative-releases-guide-creating-parklets | publisher= [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]]| accessdate= 2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013, The San Francisco Planning Department published a Parklet Manual&lt;ref name="Parklet_Manual"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130425020459/http://sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org/docs/SF_P2P_Parklet_Manual_1.0_FULL.pdf San Francisco Parklet Manual, Version 1.0] (February 2013). San Francisco Planning Department&lt;/ref&gt; which serves as a comprehensive overview of the goals, policies, process, procedures and guidelines for creating a parklet in San Francisco. The Manual also serves as a resource for those outside of San Francisco working to establish parklet programs in their own cities.

==Design and purpose==
[[File:Парклет Івано-Франківськ 01.jpg|thumb|right|A parklet in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]].]]
Parklets are designed to provide a [[public place]] for passersby to relax and enjoy the atmosphere of the city around them, in places where either current [[urban park]]s are lacking or where the existing sidewalk width is not large enough to accommodate vibrant street life activities. Parklets can be designed to be either permanent fixtures, or can be designed to be temporary/seasonal in places where snow removal is a concern. Seasonal parklets are found in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Chicago|title=People Spots|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/make_way_for_people/people_spot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Philadelphia&gt;{{cite web|last=Saffron|first=Inga|title=Transforming parking spots to parklets: Philadelphia joins an urban trend|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-04/news/29850967_1_spaces-parklets-parking-spots}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities choose to install these sites in order to create more public space by creating "places for people to sit, relax and enjoy the city."&lt;ref name=Van&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Vancouver, BC|title=Parklets: converting street parking spaces to mini plazas|url=https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/parklets.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vancouver 2013 Parklet Pilot Program Guide explains parklets purpose and design as "benefit local businesses, residents, and visitors by providing unique public spaces that attract customers and foster community conversation. They can also have additional benefits such as adding more space for people to walk in congested areas. The typical design is a platform that extends the sidewalk and provides amenities like seats, tables, bike racks, and landscaping"&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;

==Impact studies==
In September 2010, The San Francisco Great Streets Project (then part of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition) published a study, "Divisadero Trial Parklet Impact Report," on one of the first eight parklets built in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=Divisadero&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Liza|title=Divisadero Trial Parklet Impact Report|date=September 2010|publisher=San Francisco Great Streets Project|url=http://sfgreatstreets.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/DivisaderoReportPart1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study was followed in January 2012 by a "Parklet Impact Study" analyzing three corridors in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pratt|first=Liza|title=Parklet Impact Study|date=January 2010|location=San Francisco, CA|url=http://sfgreatstreets.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Parklet_Impact_Study_wAppendix.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; From October 2012 to March 2013, Los Angeles research collaborative [http://parkletstudies.carbonmade.com Parklet Studies] worked under the [http://completestreets.dlanc.com/parklets.php Complete Streets Working Group of Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council] to design and implement a one-year study of the Parklets in downtown Los Angeles.  The final report was released in March 2013.

In the [[United States]], San Francisco hosts more parklets than any other City.&lt;ref name="SFP2P Website" /&gt;  The first one-day parklet installation was created in 2005 as an unofficial [[activism|activist]] project by feeding a [[parking meter]] with coins, unrolling [[sod|grass sod]], and placing a potted tree on top.&lt;ref name="powell"&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/07/13/MNDT1K95SP.DTL&amp;tsp=1|date=13 July 2011|title=Parklets offer a place to pause on busy Powell St.|first=John|last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city's "Pavement to Parks" program was formed to facilitate installation of parklets as longer-term, yet still temporary, fixtures.&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin" /&gt;   As of 2011 the program had received over 50 applications from sponsors around the city.&lt;ref name="cpdr"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=Josh|title=‘Parklets’ Create Public Space, 120 Square Feet at a Time|url=http://www.cp-dr.com/node/2977|work=California Planning &amp; Development Report|publisher=California Planning &amp; Development Report|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the Union Square Business Improvement District installed the most ambitious parklet, a 2-block long installation along Powell Street near [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], funded by a corporate donation by [[Audi]].&lt;ref name="powell"/&gt;

Parklets are typically spaces for passive recreation, The first parklets with active recreation were installed in Los Angeles, CA in February 2013. Two sites on Spring Street, in Downtown Los Angeles, each feature two exercise bicycles on site. Upon evaluation, 20% of people surveyed in the sites said they previously used the machines; but only 5% of activity observed recorded use of the machines. Active recreation use of parklets may need some additional motivation to increase use at the exercise machines.&lt;ref name=Eval&gt;{{cite web|last=UCLA Complete Streets Initiative &amp; Parklet Studies|title=Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: Evaluation Report|url=http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parkletasessment.pdf|work=Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies|publisher=Luskin School of Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102182905/http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parkletasessment.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Parklet on the street in London has been installed in July 2015.

In April 2018, a Parklet was also created on [https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/pop-up-leeds-park-is-calling-for-the-summer-1-9131954 The Calls in Leeds], UK, as a result of a partnership between Leeds Business Improvement District (LeedsBID), Leeds City Council, and LAAND landscape architects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="537">The Pharmacy Act 1852 was the first legislation in the United Kingdom to regulate [[pharmacists]] and druggists.

It set up a register of pharmacists and limited the use of the title to people registered with the [[Pharmaceutical Society]], but proposals to give the society exclusive rights to sell drugs or poisons were rejected.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14297">'''Pollution-induced community tolerance''' ('''PICT''') is an approach to measuring the response of [[pollution]]–induced selective pressures on a community. It is an [[Ecotoxicology|eco-toxicological tool]] that approaches community [[:wikt:tolerance|tolerance]] to pollution from a holistic standpoint. Community Tolerance can increase in one of three ways: physical [[adaptations]] or [[phenotypic plasticity]], selection of favorable [[genotype]]s, and the replacement of sensitive [[species]] by tolerant species in a [[community]].

PICT differs from the population tolerance approach to community tolerance in that it can be easily applied to any ecosystem and it is not critical to use a representative test organism, as with the population tolerance approach.

==Community tolerance==

Community tolerance can be used as indicator for determining if a [[toxicant]] has a [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] on an exposed community for multiple types of [[organism]]s.&lt;ref name=Rotter&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rotter | first1 = Stefanie | last2 = Sans-Piche | first2 = Frederic | last3 = Streck | first3 = Georg | last4 = Altenburger | first4 = Rolf | last5 = Schmitt-Jansen | first5 = Mechthild | year = 2011 | title = Active Bio-monitoring of Contamination in Aquatic Systems—An in Situ Translocation Experiment Applying the PICT Concept | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166445X10004066 | journal = Aquatic Toxicology | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 228–236 | doi=10.1016/j.aquatox.2010.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerance of a toxicant can increase by three ways: physiological adaptation, also known as the phenotypic plasticity of an individual; tolerant genotypes selected within a population over time; and the replacement of species with more tolerant ones within a community.&lt;ref name=Blanck1988&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanck | first1 = Hans | last2 = Wangberg | first2 = S. A. | last3 = Molander | first3 = S. | year = 1988 | title = Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance - A New Ecotoxicological Tool."

STP | volume = 988 | issue = | pages = 219–230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological adaptation, or phenotypic plasticity, is the ability of an individual organism to change its [[phenotype]] in response to changes in the environment.&lt;ref name=Miner&gt;Miner, Benjamin G., Sonia E. Sultan, Steven G. Morgan, Dianna K. Padilla, and Rick A. Relyea. 12 December 2005. "Ecological Consequences of Phenotypic Plasticity." Elsevier. Trends in Ecology and Evolution. 20 (12): 685-692). http://bama.ua.edu/~rlearley/Miner_2005.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur with huge variance between the type of organism and the type of the disturbance they experience. [[Natural selection]] that occurs over several generations causes an entire population to exhibit specific selection of genotypes.&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;Darwin, Charles. 1859. "Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life." London: John Murray. 1st Edition. http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/charles-darwin-on-the-origin-of-species/original.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, tolerant genotypes can be selected over non-tolerant ones and can cause a shift in a population’s [[genome]].&lt;ref name=Blanck2010&gt;Blanck, Hans. 22 September 2010. “A Critical Review of Procedures and Approaches Used for Assessing Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) in Biotic Communities, Human and Ecological Risk Assessment.” Human and Ecological Risk Assessment: An International Journal. 8 (5): 1003-1034. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1080-700291905792.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection can also cause a replacement of less tolerant species with more tolerant species.&lt;ref name=Darwin /&gt; All of these aspects can alter a community's structure drastically, and if a toxicant can be identified as the culprit, action can take place to prevent that toxicant from further accumulating.&lt;ref name=Rotter /&gt; PICT can be used for linkage between cause and effect of the toxicants due to the structure of a community that has survived the event, also known as toxicant-induced succession (TIS).&lt;ref name=Blanck2010 /&gt; Toxicant-induced succession would be the development of more tolerant generations once a chemical was introduced into the environment.

There are two types of tolerances that can occur: multiple and co-tolerance. Multiple tolerances can elevate an individual' ability to tolerate several toxicants present at once.&lt;ref name=Blanck1988 /&gt;  This means that the type of chemicals present in the environment, the [[concentration]], and the organisms that are affected could alter the environment in multiple different ways. Co-tolerance is the ability of an organism to develop a tolerance to a certain toxicant in short-term tests, and obtain that tolerance for other toxicants similar to the first.&lt;ref name=Blanck1988 /&gt; It can be difficult to determine which type of tolerance is occurring if there are multiple types of toxicants in a community because they could be acting simultaneously. Basically it is difficult to understand what exactly may be going on in a community without testing it with multiple ecotoxicological tools with long- and short-term toxicity tests.

==Field studies==

Assessing pollution-induced community tolerance can be done utilizing [[In situ#Biology|in situ]] techniques, many of which involve the use of known or created chemical exposure gradients. One example is the use of a known concentration gradient of [[Tributyltin|Tri-n-butylin]] to assess PICT in [[periphyton]].&lt;ref name=Blanck1996&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanck | first1 = Hans | last2 = Dahl | first2 = Bjorn | year = 1996 | title = Pollution-induced Community Tolerance (PICT) in Marineperiphyton in Agradient of Tri-n-butyltin (TBT) Contamination | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166445X96000070 | journal = Aquatic Toxicology | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 59–77 | doi=10.1016/0166-445X(96)00007-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerance patterns showed that tolerance was highest closest to the marina that was the source of contamination. The use of reference sites in addition to contaminated sites is also commonly used for translocation assessments of PICT. A study in Germany cultured periphyton on glass discs in two river systems north of Leipzig, Germany. One system was the contaminated area of study and the other was 10&amp;nbsp;km upstream and uncontaminated, intended to be used as a reference.  After the colonization period, 6 of the 10 racks of glass discs were trans-located to the other river system. During the experiment the community structure present on the glass discs from the reference site, when translocated to the contaminated site changed to mirror that of the control discs that were left in the contaminated sites.&lt;ref name=Rotter /&gt; In another study in Denmark, enclosure experiments were done allowing for an assessment of PICT utilizing the lake water from Lake Bure as a baseline. By using this water from the lake potentially confounding variables would be nullified by comparing results to the control. Concentrations of [[atrazine]] and [[copper]] were added to these enclosures in varying concentrations. As in other experiments previously discussed periphyton communities were used in this experiment and were cultured using glass discs. [[Photosynthetic]] activity was measured and used as a measurement of PICT throughout the experiment. The experiment showed that elevated levels of Cu lead to community tolerance of the phytoplankton community as well as co-tolerance of zinc. Total [[Biomass]] decreased at the outset of the trials involving high concentrations of Cu indicating that Community Tolerance was increased due to direct mortality of the sensitive species.&lt;ref name=Gustavson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gustavson | first1 = Kim | last2 = Wangberg | first2 = Sten-Ake | year = 1995 | title = Toleranceinduction and Succession in Microalgae Communities Exposed to Copper and Atrazine | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166445X9500002L | journal = Aquatic Toxicology | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 283–302 | doi=10.1016/0166-445X(95)00002-L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of PICT in an in situ fashion is not limited to aquatic systems. A study involving [[2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene]] utilized [[respirometry|respirometric]] techniques to measure Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance in soil microbial communities in response to the presence of TNT. The results of this study further corroborate the PICT Theory, in that treatments with long-term exposure to TNT had a larger proportion of TNT-resistant bacteria than soils with low levels of TNT.&lt;ref name=Gong&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gong | first1 = Ping | last2 = Gasparrini | first2 = Pietro | last3 = Rho | first3 = Denis | last4 = Hawari | first4 = Jalal | last5 = Thiboutot | first5 = Sonia | last6 = Ampleman | first6 = Guy | last7 = Sunahara | first7 = Geofrrey I. | year = 2000 | title = An in Situ Respirometric Technique to Measure Pollution-Induced Microbial Community Tolerance in Soils Contaminated with 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene | url = | journal = Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 96–103 | doi=10.1006/eesa.2000.1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; This PICT caused by TNT was also present in another study.&lt;ref name=Siciliano&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siciliano | first1 = Steven D. | last2 = Gong | first2 = Ping | last3 = Sunahara | first3 = Geoffrey I. | last4 = Greer | first4 = Charles W. | year = 2000 | title = Assessment of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene Toxicity in Field Soils by Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance, Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis, and Seed Germination Assay | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/etc.5620190827/pdf | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 19 | issue = 8| pages = 2154–160 | doi=10.1002/etc.5620190827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, pollution-induced community tolerance can be assessed in the field by using a representative sample of the natural community in response to environmental contamination. However, this is not always the case, which is why laboratory studies are necessary supplements to properly assess PICT.

==Lab studies==

The laboratory investigation of PICT is necessary to eliminate factors other than pollution that may affect community structure.&lt;ref name=Blanck1988 /&gt; It can be conducted in conjunction with field work, as in the study by Blanck and Dahl (1996). In this study, the results from laboratory acute toxicity tests of TBT on periphyton corroborated the results from the field study, supporting the conclusion that toxicity to periphyton resulted from TBT pollution at the site under investigation.&lt;ref name=Blanck1996 /&gt; The results from [[acute toxicity]] tests can thus help determine whether the effect identified is due to a specific contaminant.

There are a variety of methods for laboratory testing, but a general format includes [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]], a [[bioassay]], and an analysis of community structure.

Samples can be collected on artificial or natural substrata, either [[in situ]] or in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=Blanck1985&gt;Blanck, Hans. 1985. “A simple, community level, ecotoxicological test system using samples of periphyton”. Hydrobiologia. 124: 251-261.&lt;/ref&gt; There must be a series of samples exposed to different concentrations of contaminant and a [[Scientific control|control]] sample. In situ sampling involves setting up a sampling device in an aquatic ecosystem and allowing it to colonize for some time (e.g. a couple of weeks). One example is the diatometer, a device that is deployed in the water that becomes colonized by [[diatoms]], and then is removed for analysis.&lt;ref name=tools&gt;“Tools of a Scientist”. Urban Rivers Awareness. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In situ sampling devices are set up at increasing distances from the pollution source in the case of [[United States regulation of point source water pollution|point source pollution]]. The samples thus represent a gradient in contaminant concentration, assuming that the contaminant becomes more dilute with increasing distance from the point source. An example of laboratory sampling was used in a study by Schmitt-Jansen and Altenburger (2005). For 14 days communities were allowed to establish on discs set up in laboratory aquariums which were continuously mixed and inoculated with [[algae]] from a pond. The aquariums were dosed with different concentrations of [[herbicide]] to get a gradient of long-term (14-day) contaminant exposures. Once a week the aquarium water was completely replaced and re-dosed with herbicide.&lt;ref name=Schmitt&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitt-Jansen | first1 = M. | last2 = Altenburger | first2 = R. | year = 2005 | title = Predicting and observing responses of algal communities to photosystem II-herbicide exposure using pollution-induced community tolerance and species-sensitivity distributions | url = | journal = Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 304–312 | doi=10.1897/03-647.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[bioassay]] is conducted on the samples to test for correlation between tolerance and long-term contaminant exposure. First, samples are exposed to different concentrations of contaminant. Then an endpoint is measured to determine the toxic effect on the sample organisms. The results from these measurements are used to produce an [[EC50]].&lt;ref name=Schmitt /&gt; Both Blanck (1996) and Schmitt-Jansen and Altenburger (2005) [[photosynthesis]] as their endpoint.&lt;ref name=Blanck1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Schmitt /&gt;

Community structure of the samples is analyzed to check for a correlation between species prevalence and long-term contaminant exposure. Samples are [[taxonomically]] classified to determine the composition and [[species diversity]] of the communities that established over the long term exposures. The results are compared to the concentration of contaminant in the long-term exposure to conclude if a relationship was found in the study.&lt;ref name=Schmitt /&gt;

[[File:Purity-Rings.jpg|thumb|right|A purity ring made from sterling silver.]]
'''Purity rings''' (also known as '''promise rings''', '''abstinence rings''', or '''chastity rings''') are worn as a sign of [[chastity]].  The practice originated in the [[United States]] in the 1990s among Christian-affiliated [[sexual abstinence]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48509-2005Mar18.html |title=Teen Pledges Barely Cut STD Rates, Study Says |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2005-03-19 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenbloom/&gt;
Wearing a purity ring is typically accompanied by a religious vow to practice abstinence until marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalmattersjournal.org/issue/2/analyzing-matters/vernacular-abstinence |title=Vernacular Abstinence |publisher=Practical Matters Journal |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Chastity rings are part of the [[abstinence-only]] sex education movement and also are intended to help the wearer to recognize their self-worth and remind them that there is more to a relationship than sex. &lt;ref name=Rosenbloom&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/fashion/thursdaystyles/08purity.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |author=Stephanie Rosenbloom|title=A Ring That Says No, Not Yet |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2005-12-08 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Bario of the Columbia News Service wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]], organizations that promote abstinence and encourage teens to sign [[virginity pledge]]s or wear purity rings have received federal grants. [[The Silver Ring Thing]], a subsidiary of a Pennsylvania evangelical church, has received more than $1 million from the government to promote abstinence and to sell its rings in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050329/NEWS/503290315/1027 |title=Power to the pure: Rutland Herald Online |publisher=Rutlandherald.com |date=2005-03-29 |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2005 the [[ACLU]] of [[Massachusetts]] brought charges against this decision, alleging that the Silver Ring program did not ensure its [[secular]]ity and hence was ineligible for federal funding due to the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=Rosenbloom/&gt;

Many celebrities, including [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Selena Gomez]], [[Jessica Simpson]], and the [[Jonas Brothers]], have worn purity rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/02/celebrities-purity-rings_n_3535439.html|title=9 Celebrities Who've Worn Purity Rings|date=2 July 2013|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=19 June 2014|quote=Believe it or not, wearing a purity ring was once a thing Miley Cyrus strongly believed in.

'''Sheet dealing''' is a term used in publishing to describe the practice of extending a print-run by 'running on' extra copies of a book's sheets, which are then sold on to a subsidiary overseas publisher to be bound into books. Sheet dealing, which can allow publishers to reduce the amount of royalties they pay authors, has been widespread among multinationals since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Blood on the Sheets"&gt;[http://www.akmedea.com/bloodsht.html Andrew Malcolm, 'Blood on the Sheets: Authors Royalties, the Multinationals and Legalised Piracy', an online article of May 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Net Receipts Royalties==
Methods of calculating royalties changed during the 1980s, due to the rise of retail chain booksellers, which demanded increasing discounts from publishers. As a result, rather than paying royalties based on a percentage of a book’s cover price, publishers preferred to pay royalties based on their net receipts. In 1991, [[Frederick Nolan]], author and former publishing executive, explained how the new system made 'sheet dealing' possible:

'It makes sense for the publisher to pay the author on the basis of what he receives, but it by no means makes it a good deal for the author. Example: 10,000 copies of a $20 book with a 10 percent cover-price royalty will earn him $20,000. The same number sold but discounted at 55 percent will net the publisher $90,000; the author's ten percent of that figure yields him $9,000. Which is one reason why publishers prefer "net receipts" contracts....Among the many other advantages (to the publisher) of such contracts is the fact that they make possible what is called a 'sheet deal'. In this, the (multinational) publisher of that same 10,000 copy print run, can substantially reduce his printing cost by 'running on' a further 10,000 copies (that is to say, printing but not binding them), and then further profit by selling these 'sheets' at cost-price or even lower if he so chooses to subsidiaries or overseas branches, then paying the author 10 percent of 'net receipts' from that deal. The overseas subsidiaries bind up the sheets into book form and sell at full price for a nice profit to the Group as a whole. The only one who loses is the author.'&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;[http://www.akmedea.com/xQFN.html Frederick Nolan, Affidavit in the case of Malcolm vs. Oxford University, 11 July 1991, 1986 Chancery Division (Damages Assessment) CHANF 92/0058/B]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, David Croom, managing director of [[Routledge]], declared that discounts could be as high as '80% in the case of bulk overseas sales.'&lt;ref name="Croom"&gt;[http://www.akmedea.com/xQDC.html David Croom, Affidavit in the Case of Malcolm vs. Oxford University, 25 June 1991, 1986 Chancery Division (Damages Assessment) CHANF 92/0058/B]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Englade vs HarperCollins==
In 2003 two American authors Ken Englade and Patricia Simpson sued HarperCollins (USA) for selling their work to its foreign affiliates in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK at improperly high discounts (72.5% for hardback and trade paperbacks and 75% for mass market paperbacks). They asserted 'that Harper Collins has improperly engaged in selling quantities of its books on a non-returnable basis to its foreign affiliates, at below-market prices. Thus, according to plaintiffs, since Harper Collins and its foreign affiliates all have the same parent company, and since all of the contracts between authors and Harper Collins require that calculations of royalties to such authors be based on amounts "received" by Harper Collins, Harper Collins is essentially selling books to itself, at discounted rates, upon which it then calculates the author's royalty, and then Harper Collins shares in the extra profit when the book is resold to the consumer by the foreign affiliates, without paying the author any further royalty.'&lt;ref name="Englade"&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/englade-v-harpercollins-publishers Englade v. HarperCollins, Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, First Department.·289 A.D.2d 159 (N.Y. App. Div. 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The suit was successful, and the court forced a [[class action]] readjustment for all authors contracted by HarperCollins between November 1993 and June 1999. The publisher settled the action by making lump sum payments to all those authors who had received royalties paid on sales to foreign affiliates at these very high discounts &lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;[http://www.akmedea.com/englade1.html Kay Murray,'HarperCollins Settles Class Action Suit', The Authors Guild Bulletin (USA), Spring 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;[http://www.akmedea.com/solomn17.html Nicola Solomon, 'Publishers' Shortcomings', ''The Author'', Spring 2003 Vol. CXIV, No.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal Opinion===
In 2003, following the HarperCollins case, Nicola Solomon, a leading British literary lawyer, was asked about the fairness of sheet dealing:

'This is a very difficult issue. Most unagented authors (and some with agents) grant worldwide volume rights, sub-licence and subsidiary rights including translation rights to their publishers. Many publishers choose to sell or sub-license to their overseas associate companies. This can work in your favour; very often a publisher is able to give a larger advance because it knows that its associate will take the book overseas. In an ideal world its established relations with its associate company should allow the two companies to work smoothly together to ensure that sales are maximised. However, many authors are rightly suspicious that cosy deals go on within groups which result in lesser overall royalties to the author....Publishers must make reasonable endeavours to sell books, and must deal with third parties on a bona fide arm's length basis which is reasonable and fair to you. Publishers are not entitled to make a secret profit by selling through a subsidiary, particularly if you would have obtained more by direct sales.

If your work has been sold to an associate company it is worth asking your publisher some questions to ensure that you are obtaining a fair royalty. Even better, ask that you be paid royalties on all sales linked to British published price or on a percentage of the associated company's receipts. Some publishers already calculate US royalties according to the receipts of their American subsidiary, which is clearly much better for authors....If you are unhappy about what your publisher is doing, don't simply accept it; ask for an explanation about anything that seems odd, check in your contract to see if it is covered and then speak to the Society or a solicitor if you are still uneasy.'&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

[[File:SilesianGorals.jpg|thumb|240px|Silesian Gorals within Cieszyn Silesia: Brenna (1), Wisła (2), Jablunkov (3), Morávka (4)]]

'''Silesian Gorals''' ({{lang-pl|Górale śląscy}}, {{lang-cs|Slezští Goralé}}, [[Cieszyn Silesia dialect|Cieszyn Silesian]]: ''Gorole''; literally "highlanders") are a [[Poles|Polish]] ethnographic group (subgroup of both [[Gorals]] and [[Silesians]]) living in [[Silesian Beskids]] and [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]] within historical region of [[Cieszyn Silesia]]. They are one of the four major ethnographic groups of Cieszyn Silesia.&lt;ref name="Dembiniok2010"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dembiniok|first=Marian|title=O Góralach, Wałachach, Lachach i Jackach na Śląsku Cieszyńskim|publisher=REGIO|year=2010|pages=3|isbn=978-80-904230-4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vlachs|Vlach colonization]] of Silesian Beskids began in the late 15th century roughly at the time when [[Brenna, Poland|Brenna]] was first mentioned in 1490. It peaked in two following centuries. The group now shares a lot of cultural traits with other [[Gorals]] of [[Western Carpathians]] stemming from a common way of living from [[shepherd]]ing in mountainous pastures, but they are also characterised by various different cultural and spiritual elements like dialect, believes, customs, costume etc.

[[Wincenty Pol]] in his survey of Gorals in the middle of the 19th century subdivided silesian Gorals into 4 groups:&lt;ref name="Pol1851"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pol|first=Wincenty|authorlink= Wincenty Pol| title=Rzut oka na północne stoki Karpat|publisher=Czcionkami drukarni Czasu|place=Kraków|year=1851|pages=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdsiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=Breniakami&amp;hl=pl&amp;ei=ggr5TMvLJ9GLswb_itXMAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Breniakami&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breniacy – in [[Brenna, Poland|Brenna]].
* Wiślanie – in [[Wisła]].
* Jabłonkowianie (Jablunkov Gorals) – exemplary Silesian Gorals living in mountainous villages around [[Jablunkov]] (Polish: Jabłonków){{efn|Important to note is that the town was inhabited by a different ethnographic group, called ''Jacki''}} including [[Koniaków]], [[Jaworzynka]], [[Istebna]],{{efn|Koniaków, Jaworzynka and Istebna are now a part of Poland.}} [[Bukovec (Frýdek-Místek District)|Bukovec]] (Bukowiec), [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]], [[Písek (Frýdek-Místek District)|Písek]] (Piosek), [[Dolní Lomná|Dolní]] and [[Dolní Lomná|Horní Lomná]] (Łomna Dolna i Górna).{{efn|Villages now part of the Czech Republic.}}
* Morawianie (Moravians) – Gorals in the villages: [[Krásná (Frýdek-Místek District)|Krásná]], [[Morávka (Frýdek-Místek District)|Morávka]] and [[Pražmo]]. Their dialect was transitional between the Polish and Czech language (see also: [[Moravians (ethnic group)|Moravians]] and [[Lach dialects]]).

[[Gorolski Święto]] is an annual international cultural and folklore festival held in Jablunkov with a primary goal to present folklore of the local Gorals.

'''Slovak''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Slovak.ogg|ˈ|s|l|oʊ|v|æ|k|,_|-|v|ɑː|k}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wells |first=John C. |year=2008 |title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary |edition=3rd |publisher=Longman |isbn=9781405881180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Roach |first=Peter |year=2011 |title=Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary |edition=18th |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521152532}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] that belongs to the [[West Slavic languages]] (together with [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and &lt;!-- This is really Sorbian, NOT Serbian! Do not change it into Serbian! --&gt;[[Sorbian language|Sorbian]]). It is called ''{{lang|sk|slovenský jazyk}}'' ({{IPA-sk|ˈslɔʋɛnskiː ˈjazik|pron|Slovensky_jazyk.ogg}}) or ''{{lang|sk|slovenčina}}'' ({{IPA-sk|ˈslɔʋɛntʃina|}}) in the language itself.

Slovak is the official language of [[Slovakia]], where it is spoken by approximately 5.51 million people (2014). Slovak speakers are also found in the [[United States]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Vojvodina|Serbia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Canada]], [[Hungary]], [[Croatia]], [[Israel]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Ukraine]] and many other countries worldwide.

Slovak should not be confused with [[Slovene language|Slovene]], or Slovenian (''{{lang|sl|slovenski jezik}}''&lt;!-- SL not SK --&gt; or ''{{lang|sl|slovenščina}}'')&lt;!-- SL not SK --&gt;, the main language of [[Slovenia]].

==Phonology==
{{main article|Slovak phonology}}
{{Summarize|from|Slovak phonology|date=April 2015}}

==Orthography==
{{Main article|Slovak orthography|Slovak braille}}

Slovak uses the [[Latin script]] with small modifications that include the four [[diacritic]]s (ˇ, ´, ¨, ˆ) placed above certain letters (a-á,ä; c-č; d-ď; dz-dž; e-é; i-í; l-ľ,ĺ; n-ň; o-ó,ô; r-ŕ; s-š; t-ť; u-ú; y-ý; z-ž)

The primary principle of Slovak spelling is the [[phoneme|phonemic]] principle. The secondary principle is the '''morphological principle''': forms derived from the same stem are written in the same way even if they are pronounced differently. An example of this principle is the assimilation rule (see below). The tertiary principle is the '''etymological principle''', which can be seen in the use of ''i'' after certain consonants and of ''y'' after other consonants, although both ''i'' and ''y'' are pronounced almost, but usually the same way.

Finally, the rarely applied '''grammatical principle''' is present when, for example, the basic singular form and plural form of masculine adjectives are written differently with no difference in pronunciation (e.g. ''pekný'' = nice – singular versus ''pekní'' = nice – plural).

In addition, the following rules are present:
#When a voiced consonant (b, d, ď, dz, dž, g, h, z, ž) is at the end of a word before a pause, it is devoiced to its voiceless counterpart (p, t, ť, c, č, k, ch, s, š, respectively). For example, ''pohyb'' is pronounced {{IPA|/pɔɦip/}} and ''prípad'' is pronounced {{IPA|/priːpat/}}.
#The '''assimilation rule''': Consonant clusters containing both voiced and voiceless elements are entirely voiced if the last consonant is a voiced one, or voiceless if the last consonant is voiceless. For example, ''otázka'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ɔtaːska/}} and ''vzchopiť sa'' is pronounced {{IPA|/fsxɔpitsːa/}}. This rule applies also over the word boundary. For example, ''prísť domov'' {{IPA|[priːzɟ dɔmɔʊ̯]}} (to come home) and ''viac jahôd'' {{IPA|[ʋɪ̯adz jaɦʊ̯ɔt]}} (more strawberries). The voiced counterpart of "ch" {{IPA|/x/}} is {{IPA|[ɣ]}}, and the unvoiced counterpart of "h" {{IPA|/ɦ/}} is {{IPA|/x/}}.

Most [[loanword|foreign words]] receive Slovak spelling immediately or after some time. For example, "weekend" is spelled ''víkend'', "software" – ''softvér'', "gay" – ''gej'' (both not exclusively), and "quality" is spelled ''kvalita.'' Personal and geographical names from other languages using Latin alphabets keep their original spelling unless a fully Slovak form of the name exists (e.g. ''Londýn'' for "London").

Slovak features some [[Heteronym (linguistics)|heterophonic homographs]] (words with identical spelling but different pronunciation and meaning), the most common examples being ''krásne'' {{IPA|/ˈkraːsnɛ/}} (beautiful) versus ''krásne'' {{IPA|/ˈkraːsɲɛ/}} (beautifully).

==Syntax==
The main features of Slovak syntax are as follows:
*The verb ([[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]) agrees in person and number with its [[subject (grammar)|subject]].

Some examples include the following:
:''Speváčka spieva.'' (The+woman+singer is+singing.)
:(Speváčk-a spieva-∅, where -∅ is (the [[null morpheme|empty]]) third-person-singular ending)

:''Speváčky spievajú.'' (Woman+singers are+singing.)
:(Speváčk-y spieva-j-ú; -ú is a third-person-plural ending, and /j/ is a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] sound)

:''My speváčky spievame.'' (We the+woman+singers are+singing.)
:(My speváčk-y spieva-me, where -me is the first-person-plural ending)
:and so forth.
*Adjectives, pronouns and numerals agree in [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and [[Grammatical case|case]] with the noun to which they refer.
*Adjectives precede their noun. Botanic or zoological terms are exceptions (e.g. ''mačka divá'', literally "cat wild", ''Felis silvestris'') as is the naming of Holy Spirit (Duch Svätý) in a majority of churches.

Word order in Slovak is relatively free, since strong [[inflection]] enables the identification of [[Grammatical relation|grammatical roles]] (subject, object, predicate, etc.) regardless of word placement. This relatively free word order allows the use of word order to convey [[information structure|topic and emphasis]].

Some examples are as follows:
:''Ten veľký muž tam dnes otvára obchod.'' = That big man opens a store there today. (''ten'' = that; ''veľký'' = big; ''muž'' = man; ''tam'' = there; ''dnes'' = today; ''otvára'' = opens; ''obchod'' = store) – The word order does not emphasize any specific detail, just general information.
:''Ten veľký muž dnes otvára obchod tam.'' = That big man is today opening a store there. – This word order emphasizes the place (''tam'' = there).
:''Dnes tam otvára obchod ten veľký muž.'' = Today over there a store is being opened by that big man. – This word order focuses on the person who is opening the store (''ten'' = that; ''veľký'' = big; ''muž'' = man).
:''Obchod tam dnes otvára ten veľký muž.'' = The store over there is today being opened by that big man. – Depending on the intonation the focus can be either on the store itself or on the person.

The [[Markedness|unmarked]] order is [[subject–verb–object]]. Variation in word order is generally possible, but word order is not completely free.
In the above example, the noun phrase ''ten veľký muž'' cannot be split up, so that the following combinations are not possible:
:''Ten otvára veľký muž tam dnes obchod.''
:''Obchod muž tam ten veľký dnes otvára.'' ...

And the following is stylistically not correct:
:''Obchod ten veľký muž dnes tam otvára.'' (Only possible in a poem or a similar style.)
:This is correct: 
:Ten veľký muž tam dnes otvára obchod
:Ten veľký muž tam otvára dnes obchod
:Otvára tam dnes ten veľký muž obchod?

==Morphology==

===Articles===
Slovak does not have articles. The demonstrative pronoun ''ten'' (fem: ''tá'', neuter: ''to'') may be used in front of the noun in situations where [[definiteness]] must be made explicit.

===Nouns, adjectives, pronouns===
{{Main article|Slovak declension}}
Slovak nouns are inflected for case and number. There are six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and instrumental. The vocative is no longer morphologically marked. There are two numbers: singular and plural. Nouns have inherent gender. There are three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Adjectives and pronouns must agree with nouns in case, number, and gender.

===Numerals===
The numerals 0–10 have unique forms, with numerals 1–4 requiring specific gendered representations. Numerals 11–19 are formed by adding ''násť'' to the end of each numeral. The suffix ''dsať'' is used to create numerals 20, 30 and 40; for numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, ''desiat'' is used. Compound numerals (21, 1054) are combinations of these words formed in the same order as their mathematical symbol is written (e.g. 21 = dvadsaťjeden, literally "twenty-one").

The numerals are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 1-10 !!  !! 11-20 !!  !! 10-100 !! 
|-
| 1 || jeden (number, masculine), jedno (neuter), jedna (feminine) || 11 || jedenásť || 10 || desať
|-
| 2 || dva (number, masculine), dve (neuter, feminine), dvaja (special masculine) || 12 || dvanásť || 20 || dvadsať
|-
| 3 || tri (number, neuter, masculine, feminine), traja (special masculine) || 13 || trinásť || 30 || tridsať
|-
| 4 || štyri (number, neuter, masculine, feminine), štyria (special masculine) || 14 || štrnásť || 40 || štyridsať
|-
| 5 || päť || 15 || pätnásť || 50 || päťdesiat
|-
| 6 || šesť || 16 || šestnásť || 60 || šesťdesiat
|-
| 7 || sedem || 17 || sedemnásť || 70 || sedemdesiat
|-
| 8 || osem || 18 || osemnásť || 80 || osemdesiat
|-
| 9 || deväť || 19 || devätnásť || 90 || deväťdesiat
|-
| 10 || desať || 20 || dvadsať || 100 || sto
|}

Some higher numbers: (200) dv'''e'''sto,... (300) tristo,... (900) deväťsto,... (1,000) tisíc,... (1,100) tisícsto,... (2,000) dv'''e'''tisíc,... (100,000) stotisíc,... (200,000) dv'''e'''stotisíc,... (1,000,000) milión,... (1,000,000,000) miliarda,...

Counted nouns have two forms. The most common form is the plural genitive (e.g. ''päť domov'' = five houses or ''stodva žien'' = one hundred two women), while the plural form of the noun when counting the amounts of 2-4, etc., is usually the nominative form without counting (e.g. ''dva domy'' = two houses or ''dve ženy'' = two women) but gender rules do apply in many cases.

===Verbs===
Verbs have three major conjugations. Three persons and two numbers (singular and plural) are distinguished. Several [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] paradigms exist as follows:
*''á''- type verbs

*Some imperfective verbs are created from the stems of perfective verbs to denote repeated or habitual actions. These are considered separate [[lexemes]]. One example is as follows: to hide (perfective) = ''skryť'', to hide (habitual) = ''skrývať''.
*Historically, two [[past tense]] forms were utilized. Both are formed analytically. The second of these, equivalent to the [[pluperfect]], is not used in the modern language, being considered archaic and/or grammatically incorrect. Examples for two related verbs are as follows:
:skryť: skryl som (I hid / I have hidden); bol som skryl (I had hidden)
:skrývať: skrýval som; bol som skrýval.
*One [[future tense]] exists. For imperfective verbs, it is formed analytically, for perfective verbs it is identical with the present tense. Some examples are as follows:
:skryť: skryjem
:skrývať: budem skrývať
*Two [[conditional mood|conditional]] forms exist. Both are formed analytically from the past tense:
:skryť: skryl by som (I would hide), bol by som skryl (I would have hidden)
:skrývať: skrýval by som; bol by som skrýval
*The [[grammatical voice|passive voice]] is formed either as in English (to be + past participle) or using the reflexive pronoun 'sa':
:skryť: je skrytý; sa skryje
:skrývať: je skrývaný; sa skrýva
*The active present [[participle]] (= ~ing (one)) is formed using the suffixes -úci/ -iaci / -aci
:skryť: skryjúci
:skrývať: skrývajúci
*The [[Transgressive (linguistics)|transgressive]] (=(while/by) ...ing) is formed using the suffixes -úc / -uc / -iac/-ac.{{clarify|date=December 2012}}&lt;!-- is this still used in Slovak or is it archaic? --&gt;
:skryť: skryjúc (by hiding (perfective))
:skrývať: skrývajúc ((while/during) hiding)
*The active past [[participle]] (= ~ing (in the past)) was formerly formed using the suffix -vší, but is no longer used.
*The [[passive participle]] (= ~ed (one), the "third form") is formed using the suffixes -ný / -tý / -ený:
:skryť: skrytý
:skrývať: skrývaný
*The [[gerund]] (= the (process of) ...ing) is formed using the suffix -{{Not a typo|ie}}:
:skryť: skrytie
:skrývať: skrývanie

===Adverbs===
Adverbs are formed by replacing the adjectival ending with the ending -''o'' or -''e'' / -''y''. Sometimes both -''o'' and -''e'' are possible. Examples include the following:
:vysoký (high) – vysoko (highly)
:pekný (nice) – pekne (nicely)
:priateľský (friendly) – priateľsky (in a friendly manner)
:rýchly (fast) – rýchlo (quickly)

The comparative/superlative of adverbs is formed by replacing the adjectival ending with a comparative/superlative ending -''(ej)ší'' or -''(ej)šie''. Examples include the following:
:rýchly (fast) – rýchlejší (faster) – najrýchlejší (fastest): rýchlo (quickly) – rýchlejšie (more quickly) – najrýchlejšie (most quickly)

===Prepositions===
Each preposition is associated with one or more grammatical cases. The noun governed by a preposition must appear in the case required by the preposition in the given context (e.g. from friends = ''od priateľov''). ''Priateľov'' is the genitive case of ''priatelia''. It must appear in this case because the preposition ''od'' (= from) always calls for its objects to be in the genitive.
:around the square = ''po námestí'' (locative case)
:past the square = ''po námestie'' (accusative case)
''Po'' has a different meaning depending on the case of its governed noun.

==History==
{{Main article|History of the Slovak language}}

==Relationships to other languages==
The Slovak language is a descendant of [[Proto-Slavic]], itself a descendant of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. It is closely related to the other [[West Slavic languages]], primarily to [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Polish language|Polish]]. Czech also influenced the language in its later development. To lesser degrees, moreover, Slovak has been influenced by [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], and recently [[English language|English]].

===Czech===
Although most dialects of Czech and Slovak are [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] (see [[Comparison of Slovak and Czech]]), [[eastern Slovak dialects]] are less intelligible to speakers of Czech and closer to Polish, and contact between speakers of Czech and speakers of the eastern dialects is limited.

Since the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] it has been permitted to use Czech in TV broadcasting and—like any other language of the world—during court proceedings (Administration Procedure Act 99/1963 Zb.). From 1999 to August 2009, the Minority Language Act 184/1999 Z.z., in its section (§) 6, contained the variously interpreted unclear provision saying that "When applying this act, it holds that the use of the Czech language fulfills the requirement of fundamental intelligibility with the state language"; the state language is Slovak and the Minority Language Act basically refers to municipalities with more than 20% ethnic minority population (no such Czech municipalities are found in Slovakia). Since 1 September 2009 (due to an amendment to the State Language Act 270/1995 Z.z.) a language "fundamentally intelligible with the state language" (i.e. the Czech language) may be used in contact with state offices and bodies by its native speakers, and documents written in it and issued by bodies in the Czech Republic are officially accepted. Regardless of its official status, Czech is used commonly both in Slovak mass media and in daily communication by Czech natives as an equal language.

Czech and Slovak have a long history of interaction and mutual influence well before the creation of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1918, a state which existed until 1993. [[literary language|Literary]] Slovak shares significant [[Czech orthography|orthographic features with Czech]], as well as technical and professional terminology dating from the Czechoslovak period, but phonetic, grammatical, and vocabulary [[Differences between Slovak and Czech|differences]] do exist.

===Other Slavic languages===
Slavic language varieties tend to be closely related, and have had a large degree of mutual influence, due to the complicated ethnopolitical history of their historic ranges. This is reflected in the many features Slovak shares with neighboring language varieties. Standard Slovak shares high degrees of mutual intelligibility with many Slavic varieties. Despite this closeness to other Slavic varieties, significant variation exists among Slovak dialects. In particular, eastern varieties differ significantly from the standard language, which is based on central and western varieties.

[[Eastern Slovak dialects]] have the greatest degree of mutual intelligibility with [[Polish language|Polish]] of all the Slovak dialects followed by [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], but both lack technical terminology and upper [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] expressions. Polish and [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]] also differ quite considerably from Czech and Slovak in upper registers, but non-technical and lower register speech is readily intelligible. Some mutual intelligibility occurs with spoken [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], and even [[Russian language|Russian]] (in this order), although their orthographies are based on the [[Cyrillic script]].

Some examples are as follows:
*"wicker whip": Slovak ''korbáč'' (the standard name for "whip" is ''bič'' and ''korbáč'', itself originating from [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''kırbaç'', usually means only one particular type of it—the "wicker whip") – Hungarian ''korbács'';
*"dragon/kite": Slovak ''šarkan'' (rather rare, ''drak'' is far more common in this meaning; ''šarkan'' often means only "kite", esp. a small one that is flown for fun and this term is far more common than ''drak'' in this meaning; for the "dragon kite", the term ''drak'' is still used almost exclusively) – Hungarian ''sárkány''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/~nyelvor/period/1233/123306.htm|title=Magyar Nyelvőr – Pacsai Imre: Magyar–szlovák kulturális és nyelvi kapcsolat jegyei...|first=Pacsai|last=Imre|website=www.c3.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects==
[[File:Vojvodina slovak map.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Official usage of the Slovak language in Vojvodina, Serbia]]
There are many Slovak dialects, which are divided into the following four basic groups:
*[[Eastern Slovak dialects]] (in [[Spiš]], [[Šariš]], [[Zemplín (region)|Zemplín]] and [[Abov]])
*Central Slovak dialects (in [[Liptov]], [[Orava (region)|Orava]], [[Turiec]], [[Tekov]], [[Hont County|Hont]], [[Novohrad]], [[Gemer]] and the historic [[Zvolen county]])
*Western Slovak dialects (in remaining Slovakia: [[Kysuce]], [[Trenčín]], [[Trnava]], [[Nitra]], [[Záhorie]])
*Lowland (dolnozemské) Slovak dialects (outside Slovakia in the [[Pannonian Plain]] in Serbian [[Vojvodina]], and in southeastern [[Hungary]], western [[Romania]], and the Croatian part of [[Syrmia]])

The fourth group of dialects is often not considered a separate group, but a subgroup of Central and Western Slovak dialects (see e.g. Štolc, 1968), but it is currently undergoing changes due to contact with surrounding languages (Serbo-Croatian, Romanian, and Hungarian) and long-time geographical separation from Slovakia (see the studies in ''Zborník Spolku vojvodinských slovakistov'', e.g. Dudok, 1993).

For an external map of the three groups in Slovakia see [http://www.pitt.edu/~armata/dialects.htm here].

The dialect groups differ mostly in phonology, vocabulary, and tonal inflection. Syntactic differences are minor. Central Slovak forms the basis of the present-day standard language. Not all dialects are fully mutually intelligible. It may be difficult for an inhabitant of the western Slovakia to understand a dialect from eastern Slovakia and the other way around.

The dialects are fragmented geographically, separated by numerous mountain ranges. The first three groups already existed in the 10th century. All of them are spoken by the Slovaks outside Slovakia (USA, Canada, Croatian [[Slavonia]], and elsewhere), and central and western dialects form the basis of the lowland dialects (see above).

The western dialects contain features common with the Moravian dialects in the Czech Republic, the southern central dialects contain a few features common with South Slavic languages, and the eastern dialects a few features common with Polish and the East Slavonic languages (cf. Štolc, 1994). Lowland dialects share some words and [[areal feature]]s with the languages surrounding them (Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian).

'''''Turkish Red Crescent''''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Türk Kızılayı'' (official) or ''Kızılay'' (for short)) is the largest humanitarian organization in [[Turkey]] and is part of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]].

The organization was founded in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1868, partly in response to the experience of the [[Crimean War]], in which disease overshadowed battle as the main cause of death and suffering among [[Turkish people|Turkish]] soldiers. It was the first Red Crescent society of its kind and one of the most important charity organizations in the [[Muslim]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hazine.info/turkish-red-crescent-kizilay-archives-ankara/|title=Red Crescent Archives|last=|first=|date=|website=hazine.info|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The society is a not-for-profit, volunteer-based social service institution providing unconditional aid and service, and is a corporate body governed by special legal provisions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kizilay.org.tr|title=Türk Kızılayı {{!}} Anasayfa|last=Kızılayı|first=Türk|website=www.kizilay.org.tr|language=tr|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/links-between-turkey-and-isis-are-now-undeniable-2015-7/|title=Senior Western official: Links between Turkey and ISIS are now 'undeniable'|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The organization was founded under the [[Ottoman Empire]] on 11 June 1868 and was named "Hilâl-i Ahmer Cemiyeti".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It later took on the names:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* "Ottoman Red Crescent Society” in 1877
* “Turkey’s Red Crescent Community” in 1923
* “Turkish Red Crescent Community” in 1935
* “Turkish Red Crescent Society” in 1947
It was renamed Kızılay by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in 1935,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; after the foundation of the Republic of [[Turkey]] in 1923.

Beginning with the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]], the Turkish Red Crescent Society has provided medical relief to soldiers in all battlefields in which Turkey was present, through mobile and fixed hospitals, patient transportation services, hospital vessels, trained nurses and volunteers. It has provided humanitarian care regardless of nationality to all civilians affected by war. It has been involved in disaster relief and aid in natural disasters in Turkey. It has participated in international relief and response activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Partnerships ==

=== Partnership with Qatar Charity ===
The Turkish Red Crescent has recently begun to partner with Qatar Charity (QC) on various humanitarian projects.

In December 2016, the Turkish Red Crescent together with QC made a $10 million deal with the Turkish government to provide services for Syrian refugees in Turkey over the next five years. Kerem Kinik, head of the organization added “We have common areas of interest such as [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iraq]] and [[Somalia]]...this collaboration is just a beginning”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20161213-turkey-and-qatar-launch-joint-aid-campaign-for-syrians/|title=Turkey and Qatar launch joint aid campaign for Syrians|date=2016-12-13|work=Middle East Monitor|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the organization and QC provided aid to victims of flooding and violence in [[Beledweyne]], Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/africa/174143/turkey-qatar-launch-joint-aid-campaign-in-somalia|title=Turkey, Qatar launch joint aid campaign in Somalia - World Bulletin|work=World Bulletin|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalia has lost much of its rural areas to [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], a terrorist organization with links to [[al-Qaeda]] that consistently carries out attacks throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-15336689|title=Who are Somalia's al-Shabab?|date=2017-12-22|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-27|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnership with Turkish government ===
Following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]], the Turkish Red Crescent backed the Turkish government, sending a letter to hundreds of international aid organizations and NGOs, including to organizations of the [[United Nations]] and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Crescents]] in 191 total countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.azvision.az/Turkish_Red_Crescent_sends_-44633-xeber.html|title=Turkish Red Crescent sends coup letter to 191 countries|last=Azvision|website=https://azvision.az|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the government, the Turkish Red Crescent blamed the [[Gülen movement]] (which the government of Turkey considers a terrorist organization) for the coup attempt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Global Gathering ==
In November 6th-11th 2017, the International Red Cross and the Turkish Red Crescent movement brought together 190 national red cross and red crescent societies. Some major issues they discussed were: migration where they addressed prioritizing safety and assistance, nuclear weapons where they were working towards their elimination, and health where they addressed mental health and psycho social needs. Other issues included the need to involve affected people in relief and recovery efforts; the use of explosive weapons in popular areas; and the looming threat of epidemics and pandemics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''''What Do You Say to a Naked Lady?''''' is a 1970 American [[hidden camera|hidden-camera]] style [[reality film]], directed by ''[[Candid Camera]]'' creator [[Allen Funt]]. In the film, Funt secretly records people's reactions to unexpected encounters with [[nudity]] or [[Human sexual activity|sexuality]] in unusual situations. This was the first of two ''Candid Camera''–style theatrical films to be produced and directed by Funt, the other being ''[[Money Talks (1972 film)|Money Talks]]'' (1972).

While the film does contain some titillating material and both male and female [[full frontal nudity]], a large amount of the film involves Funt talking to people about sexuality and sexual topics. Whereas Funt's other productions had to fall within [[Federal Communications Commission]] guidelines prohibiting nudity and sexual content on the airwaves, this film was outside the FCC's jurisdiction and Funt was free to incorporate them into the film.

In the U.S., the film was originally [[rated X]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]; an edited version was [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated R]] in 1982. When submitted to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] in 1970, the film was originally rejected, then rated X; a 1988 video release was rated 18.

The film was released on [[VHS]] in the 1980s, with a [[DVD]] released on December 6, 2011.

In 2010, the ''[[Caucasian Knot]]'' described the '''women of South Ossetia''' as females who can transmit change and reinstatement of "trust and peace" between the peoples of [[South Ossetia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  They have the capability and competence to defend and preserve their rights as women and to participate as activists and peacemakers.  South Ossetian women experienced situations of armed [[Georgian-Ossetian conflict|conflict]] in their regions.&lt;ref name=PWO&gt;[http://www.peacewomen.org/news_article.php?id=948&amp;type=news GEORGIA: Female NGO Activists of Georgia and South Ossetia Meet in Baku to Search Ways to Stop Enmity], Caucasian Knot, peacewomen.org, June 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kavkaz&gt;[http://www.eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/13512/ Female NGO activists of Georgia and South Ossetia meet in Baku to search ways to stop enmity], Caucasian Knot, kavkaz-uzel.ru&lt;/ref&gt;  The main organization that promotes and safeguards the status of South Ossetian women is the Association of South Ossetian Women for Democracy and Human Rights (sometimes referred to as Association of Women of South Ossetia for Democracy and Defence of Human Rights) and is currently headed by [[Lira Kozaeva-Tskhovrebova]].&lt;ref name=PWO/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kavkaz/&gt;
