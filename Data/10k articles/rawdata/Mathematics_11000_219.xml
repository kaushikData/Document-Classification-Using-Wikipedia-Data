In [[Abstract algebra|algebra]], the '''Abel–Ruffini theorem''' (also known as '''Abel's impossibility theorem''') states that there is no [[algebraic solution]]—that is, solution in [[Nth root|radicals]]—to the general [[Algebraic equation|polynomial equations]] of degree five or higher with arbitrary [[coefficients]]. The theorem is named after [[Paolo Ruffini]], who made an incomplete proof in 1799,&lt;ref name="Ayoub"/&gt; and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], who provided a proof in 1824.&lt;ref name="Abel1"&gt;{{Citation|last = Abel|first = Niels Henrik|author-link = Niels Henrik Abel|chapter = Mémoire sur les équations algébriques, ou l'on démontre l'impossibilité de la résolution de l'équation générale du cinquième degré|chapter-url = http://www.abelprisen.no/nedlastning/verker/oeuvres_1881_del1/oeuvres_completes_de_abel_nouv_ed_1_kap03_opt.pdf|title = Œuvres Complètes de Niels Henrik Abel|volume = I|edition = 2nd|editor-last = Sylow|editor-first = Ludwig|editor-link = Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|editor-last2 = Lie|editor-first2 = Sophus|editor-link2 = Sophus Lie|year = 1881|origyear = 1824|pages = 28–33|publisher = [[Grøndahl &amp; Søn Forlag|Grøndahl &amp; Søn]]|language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abel2"&gt;{{Citation|last = Abel|first = Niels Henrik|author-link = Niels Henrik Abel|chapter = Démonstration de l'impossibilité de la résolution algébrique des équations générales qui passent le quatrième degré|title = Œuvres Complètes de Niels Henrik Abel|volume = I|edition = 2nd|editor-last = Sylow|editor-first = Ludwig|editor-link = Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|editor-last2 = Lie|editor-first2 = Sophus|editor-link2 = Sophus Lie|year = 1881|origyear = 1826|pages = 66–87|chapter-url = http://www.abelprisen.no/nedlastning/verker/oeuvres_1839/oeuvres_completes_de_abel_1_kap02_opt.pdf|publisher = [[Grøndahl &amp; Søn Forlag|Grøndahl &amp; Søn]]|language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==
The theorem does ''not'' assert that some higher-degree polynomial equations have ''no'' solution. In fact, the opposite is true: ''every'' non-constant polynomial equation in one unknown, with [[real numbers|real]] or [[complex numbers|complex]] coefficients, has at least one complex number as a solution (and thus, by [[polynomial division]], as many complex roots as its degree, counting repeated roots); this is the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. These solutions can be computed to any desired degree of accuracy using numerical methods such as the [[Newton's method|Newton&amp;ndash;Raphson method]] or the [[Laguerre's method|Laguerre method]], and in this way they are no different from solutions to polynomial equations of the second, third, or fourth degrees. It also does ''not'' assert that ''no'' higher-degree polynomial equations can be solved in radicals: the equation {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 {{=}} 0}} can be solved in radicals for every positive integer {{math|''n''}}, for example.  The theorem only shows that there is no ''general solution in radicals'' that applies to ''all'' equations of a given degree greater than {{math|4}}.

The solution of any second-degree polynomial equation can be expressed in terms of its coefficients, using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and [[square root]]s, in the familiar [[quadratic formula]]:  the roots of the equation {{math|''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' + ''c'' {{=}} 0}} (with {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}) are

:{{bigmath|{{sfrac|−''b'' ± {{sqrt|(''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 4''ac'')}}|2''a''}}}}.

Analogous formulas for [[cubic equation|third-degree equations]] and [[quartic equation|fourth-degree equations]] (using [[square root]]s and [[cube root]]s) have been known since the 16th century. What the Abel–Ruffini theorem says is that there is no similar formula for general equations of fifth degree or higher. In principle, it could be that the equations of the fifth degree could be split in several types and, for each one of these types, there could be some algebraic solution valid within that type.  Or, as [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] wrote, "for all that Abel's  methods could prove, every particular quintic equation might be soluble, with a special formula for each equation."&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{Citation|last = Stewart|first = Ian|author-link = Ian Stewart (mathematician)|title = Galois Theory|chapter = Historical Introduction|publisher = [[CRC Press]]|isbn = 978-1-4822-4582-0|year = 2015|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not so, but this impossibility is a strictly stronger result than the Abel–Ruffini theorem and is derived with [[Galois theory]].

== Proof ==
The following proof is based on [[Galois theory]] and it is valid for any field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]]&amp;nbsp;{{math|0}}. Historically, Ruffini&lt;ref name="Ayoub"/&gt; and Abel's proofs precede Galois theory. For a modern presentation of Abel's proof see the article of [[Michael Rosen (mathematician)|Rosen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Rosen|first = Michael I.|author-link = Michael Rosen (mathematician)|title = Niels Hendrik Abel and Equations of the Fifth Degree|journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]|year = 1995|volume = 102|issue = 6|pages = 495–505|doi = 10.2307/2974763|jstor = 2974763|zbl = 0836.01015|mr = 1336636}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the books of Tignol&lt;ref name="Tignol_Abel"&gt;{{Citation|last = Tignol|first = Jean-Pierre|title=Galois' Theory of Algebraic Equations|edition = 2nd|publisher = [[World Scientific]]|year = 2016|isbn = 978-981-4704-69-4|zbl = 1333.12001|chapter = Ruffini and Abel on General Equations}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Pesic.&lt;ref name="Pesic"&gt;{{Citation|last = Pesic|first = Peter|title = Abel's Proof:  An Essay on the Sources and Meaning of Mathematical Unsolvability|location = Cambridge|publisher = [[MIT Press]]|year = 2004|isbn = 0-262-66182-9|zbl = 1166.01010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fundamental theorems of Galois theory states that a polynomial {{math|''P''(''x'') &amp;isin; ''F''[''x'']}} is solvable by radicals over {{math|''F''}} if and only if its [[splitting field]] {{math|''K''}} over {{math|''F''}} has a [[Solvable group|solvable]] [[Galois group]],&lt;ref name="Jacobson"&gt;{{Citation| last=Jacobson| first=Nathan| author-link=Nathan Jacobson| year=2009| title=Basic Algebra| edition=2nd| volume = 1 | series= | publisher=Dover| isbn = 978-0-486-47189-1|chapter = Galois Theory of Equations}}&lt;/ref&gt; so the proof of the Abel–Ruffini theorem comes down to computing the Galois group of the general polynomial of the fifth degree, and showing that it is not solvable.

Consider five [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}, let {{math|''E'' {{=}} '''Q'''(''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and let

:{{math|''P''(''x'') {{=}} (''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) ∈ ''E''[''x''].}}

Expanding {{math|''P''(''x'')}} out yields the [[Elementary symmetric polynomial|elementary]] [[symmetric function]]s of the {{math|''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}:

:{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}},

:{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}},

:{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}},

:{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}},

:{{math|''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

The coefficient of {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''}} in {{math|''P''(''x'')}} is thus {{math|(−1)&lt;sup&gt;5 − ''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''s''&lt;sub&gt;5 − ''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Let {{math|''F'' {{=}} '''Q'''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be the field obtained by adjoining the symmetric functions to the rationals. Then {{math|''P''(''x'') ∈ ''F''[''x'']}}. Because the {{math|''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}'s are indeterminates, every permutation {{math|''σ''}} in the symmetric group on {{math|5}} letters {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} induces a distinct [[automorphism]] {{math|''σ''′}} on {{math|''E''}} that leaves {{math|'''Q'''}} fixed and permutes the elements {{math|''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. Since an arbitrary rearrangement of the roots of the product form still produces the same polynomial, e.g.

:{{math|(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

is the same polynomial as

:{{math|(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(''x'' − ''y''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)}},

the automorphisms {{math|''σ''′}} also leave {{math|''F''}} fixed, so they are elements of the Galois group {{math|Gal(''E''/''F'')}}.  Therefore, we have shown that {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ Gal(''E''/''F'')}}; however there could possibly be automorphisms there that are not in {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}. But, since the Galois group of the splitting field of a quintic polynomial has at most {{math|5!}} elements, and since {{math|''E''}} is a splitting field of {{math|''P''(''x'')}}, it follows that {{math|Gal(''E''/''F'')}} is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}.  Generalizing this argument shows that the Galois group of every general polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is isomorphic to {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.

The only [[composition series]] of {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ {''e''}}} (where {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[alternating group]] on five letters, also known as the [[icosahedral group]]). However, the [[quotient group]] {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/{''e''}}} (isomorphic to {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} itself) is not [[Abelian group|abelian]], and so {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} is not solvable, so it must be that the general polynomial of the fifth degree has no solution in radicals.  Since the first nontrivial [[normal subgroup]] of the symmetric group on&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}} letters is always the alternating group on&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}} letters, and since the alternating groups on&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}} letters for {{math|''n'' ≥ 5}} are always [[simple group|simple]] and non-abelian, and hence not solvable, it also says that the general polynomials of all degrees higher than the fifth also have no solution in radicals. [[Q.E.D.]]

The above construction of the Galois group for a fifth degree polynomial only applies to the ''general polynomial''; specific polynomials of the fifth degree may have different Galois groups with quite different properties, e.g. {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} has a splitting field generated by a [[primitive root of unity|primitive 5th root of unity]], and hence its Galois group is abelian and the equation itself solvable by radicals; moreover, the argument does not provide any rational-valued quintic that has {{math|''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}} as its Galois group.  However, since the result is on the general polynomial, it does say that a general “quintic formula” for the roots of a quintic using only a finite combination of the arithmetic operations and radicals in terms of the coefficients is impossible.

The proof is not valid if applied to polynomials whose degree is less than {{math|5}}. Indeed:
* the group {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} is ''not'' simple, because the subgroup {{math|{''e'', (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}}}, isomorphic to the [[Klein four-group]], is a normal subgroup;
* the groups {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} ''are'' simple, but since they are abelian too ({{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the trivial group and {{math|''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[cyclic group]] of order&amp;nbsp;{{math|3}}), that is not a problem.

The proof remains valid if, instead of working with five indeterminates, one works with five concrete [[Algebraic independence|algebraically independent]] complex numbers, because, by the same argument, {{math|Gal(''E''/''F'') {{=}} ''S''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

== History ==
Around 1770, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] began the groundwork that unified the many different tricks that had been used up to that point to solve equations, relating them to the theory of groups of [[permutation]]s, in the form of [[Lagrange resolvents]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Lagrange|first = Joseph-Louis|author-link = Joseph Louis Lagrange|chapter = Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations|title = Œuvres de Lagrange|editor-last = Serret|editor-first = Joseph-Alfred|editor-link = Joseph Alfred Serret|year = 1869|origyear = 1771|publisher = Gauthier-Villars|pages = 205–421|volume = III}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovative work by Lagrange was a precursor to Galois theory, and its failure to develop solutions for equations of fifth and higher degrees hinted that such solutions might be impossible, but it did not provide conclusive proof. The first person who conjectured that the problem of solving quintics by radicals might be impossible to solve was [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who wrote in 1798 in section&amp;nbsp;359 of his book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (which would be published only in 1801) that “there is little doubt that this problem does not so much defy modern methods of analysis as that it proposes the impossible”. The next year, in his [[thesis]], he wrote “After the labors of many geometers left little hope of ever arriving at the resolution of the general equation algebraically, it appears more and more likely that this resolution is impossible and contradictory.” And he added “Perhaps it will not be so difficult to prove, with all rigor, the impossibility for the fifth degree. I shall set forth my investigations of this at greater length in another place.” Actually, Gauss published nothing else on this subject.&lt;ref name="Ayoub"/&gt;
[[File:Ruffini - Teoria generale delle equazioni, 1799 - 1366896.jpg|thumb|[[Paolo Ruffini]], ''Teoria generale delle equazioni'', 1799]]

The theorem was first nearly proved by [[Paolo Ruffini]] in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Ruffini|first = Paolo|author-link = Paolo Ruffini|year = 1799|title = Teoria generale delle equazioni, in cui si dimostra impossibile la soluzione algebraica delle equazioni generali di grado superiore al quarto|publisher = Stamperia di S. Tommaso d'Aquino|language = Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sent his proof to several mathematicians to get it acknowledged, amongst them Lagrange (who did not reply) and [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], who sent him a letter saying: “Your memoir on the general solution of equations is a work which I have always believed should be kept in mind by mathematicians and which, in my opinion, proves conclusively the algebraic unsolvability of general equations of higher than fourth degree.”&lt;ref name="Kiernan"&gt;{{Citation|last = Kiernan|first = B.

Abel wrote: “The first and, if I am not mistaken, the only one who, before me, has sought to prove the impossibility of the algebraic solution of general equations is the mathematician Ruffini. But his memoir is so complicated that it is very difficult to determine the validity of his argument.  It seems to me that his argument is not completely satisfying.”&lt;ref name="Kiernan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Abel|first = Niels Henrik|author-link = Niels Henrik Abel|chapter = Sur la resolution algébriques des équations|chapter-url = http://www.abelprize.no/nedlastning/verker/oeuvres_1881_del2/oeuvres_completes_de_abel_nouv_ed_2_kap18_opt.pdf|title = Œuvres Complètes de Niels Henrik Abel|volume = II|edition = 2nd|editor-last = Sylow|editor-first = Ludwig|editor-link = Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|editor-last2 = Lie|editor-first2 = Sophus|editor-link2 = Sophus Lie|year = 1881|origyear = 1828|pages = 217–243|publisher = [[Grøndahl &amp; Søn Forlag|Grøndahl &amp; Søn]]|language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof also, as it was discovered later, was incomplete. Ruffini assumed that all radicals that he was dealing with could be expressed from the roots of the polynomial using field operations alone; in modern terms, he assumed that the radicals belonged to the splitting field of the polynomial. To see why this is really an extra assumption, consider, for instance, the polynomial {{math|''P''(''x'') {{=}} ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 15''x'' − 20}}. According to [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's formula]], one of its roots (all of them, actually) can be expressed as the sum of a cube root of {{math|10 + 5''i''}} with a cube root of {{math|10 − 5''i''}}. On the other hand, since {{math|''P''(−3) &lt; 0}}, {{math|''P''(−2) &gt; 0}}, {{math|''P''(−1) &lt; 0}}, and {{math|''P''(5) &gt; 0}}, the roots {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''P''(''x'')}} are all real and therefore the field {{math|'''Q'''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}. But then the numbers {{math|10 ± 5''i''}} cannot belong to {{math|'''Q'''(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. While Cauchy either did not notice Ruffini's assumption or felt that it was a minor one, most historians believe that the proof was not complete until Abel proved the theorem on natural irrationalities, which asserts that the assumption holds in the case of general polynomials.&lt;ref name="Tignol_Abel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Stewart|first = Ian|author-link = Ian Stewart (mathematician)|title = Galois Theory|chapter = The Idea Behind Galois Theory|publisher = [[CRC Press]]|isbn = 978-1-4822-4582-0|year = 2015|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Abel–Ruffini theorem is thus generally credited to Abel, who published a proof in just six pages in 1824.&lt;ref name="Abel1"/&gt; However, this short number of pages was obtained at the cost of writing in a very terse style. This was due to the fact that he had the proof printed at his own expenses and he needed to save paper and money.&lt;ref name="Pesic"/&gt; A more elaborated version of the proof would be published in 1826.&lt;ref name="Abel2"/&gt;

Proving that the general quintic (and higher) equations were unsolvable by radicals did not completely settle the matter, because the Abel–Ruffini theorem does not provide necessary and sufficient conditions for saying precisely which quintic (and higher) equations are unsolvable by radicals. Abel was working on a complete characterization when he died in 1829.&lt;ref name="Tignol2001"/&gt;

According to [[Nathan Jacobson]], “The proofs of Ruffini and of Abel [&amp;hellip;] were soon superseded by the crowning achievement of this line of research: Galois' discoveries in the theory of equations.”&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt; In 1830, Galois (at the age of 18) submitted to the [[Paris Academy of Sciences]] a memoir on his theory of solvability by radicals, which was ultimately rejected in 1831 as being too sketchy and for giving a condition in terms of the roots of the equation instead of its coefficients. Galois was aware of the contributions of Ruffini and Abel, since he wrote “It is a common truth, today, that the general equation of degree greater than {{math|4}} cannot be solved by radicals&amp;hellip; this truth has become common (by hearsay) despite the fact that geometers  have ignored the proofs of Abel and Ruffini&amp;hellip;” &lt;ref name="Ayoub"&gt;{{Citation|last = Ayoub|first = Raymond G.|title = Paolo Ruffini's Contributions to the Quintic|journal = [[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]|doi = 10.1007/BF00357046|volume = 22|issue = 3|pages = 253–277|year = 1980|jstor = 41133596|mr = 606270|zbl = 0471.01008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galois then died in 1832 and his paper ''Mémoire sur les conditions de resolubilité des équations par radicaux''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Galois|first = Évariste|author-link = Évariste Galois|journal = [[Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées]]|title = Mémoire sur les conditions de resolubilité des équations par radicaux|pages = 417–433|url = https://www.bibnum.education.fr/sites/default/files/galois_memoire_sur_la_resolubiblite.pdf|year = 1846|volume = XI|language = french}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained unpublished until 1846, when it was published by [[Joseph Liouville]] accompanied by some of his own explanations.&lt;ref name="Tignol2001"&gt;{{Citation|last = Tignol|first = Jean-Pierre|title=Galois' Theory of Algebraic Equations|edition = 2nd|publisher = [[World Scientific]]|year = 2016|isbn = 978-981-4704-69-4|zbl = 1333.12001|chapter = Galois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this publication, Liouville announced Galois' result to the Academy in a speech he gave on 4 July 1843.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt; A simplification of Abel's proof was published by [[Pierre Wantzel]] in 1845.&lt;ref name="Wantzel"&gt;{{Citation|last=Wantzel|first=Pierre|title=Démonstration de l’impossibilité de résoudre toutes les équations algébriques avec des radicaux|url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=NAM_1845_1_4__57_0|year=1845|author-link=Pierre Wantzel|journal=[[Nouvelles Annales de Mathématiques]]|volume=4|pages=57–65|language=french}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he published it, he was already aware of the contributions by Galois and he mentions that, whereas Abel's proof is valid only for general polynomials, Galois' approach can be used to provide a concrete polynomial of degree&amp;nbsp;{{math|5}} whose roots cannot be expressed in radicals from its coefficients.

[[File:Amplituhedron-0c.png|thumb]]
An '''amplituhedron''' is a geometric structure introduced in 2013 by [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]] and Jaroslav Trnka. It enables simplified calculation of [[particle]] interactions in some [[quantum field]] theories. In [[Planar Yang–Mills theory|planar ''N'' = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]], also equivalent to the perturbative [[Topological string theory#B-model|topological B model string theory]] in [[twistor space]], an amplituhedron is defined as a mathematical space known as the positive [[Grassmannian]].{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Trnka|2014}}&lt;ref name="Witten"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Witten|first=Edward|title=Perturbative Gauge Theory As A String Theory In Twistor Space:|journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics|date=December 2003|volume=252|series=1|issue=1|page=189|doi=10.1007/s00220-004-1187-3|arxiv=hep-th/0312171|bibcode = 2004CMaPh.252..189W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amplituhedron theory challenges the notion that [[Spacetime|space-time]] [[Principle of locality|locality]] and [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]] are necessary components of a model of particle interactions. Instead, they are treated as properties that emerge from an underlying phenomenon.{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Bourjaily|Cachazo|Goncharov|2012}}&lt;ref name=ohanlon20130919&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/how-to-feel-about-space-and-time-maybe-not-existing-76578241dca2|title=How to Feel About Space and Time Maybe Not Existing|publisher=Pacific Standard|author= Ryan O'Hanlon | date=September 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The connection between the amplituhedron and scattering amplitudes is at present a conjecture that has passed many non-trivial checks, including an understanding of how locality and unitarity arise as consequences of positivity.{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Trnka|2014}}

Research has been led by [[Nima Arkani-Hamed]]. [[Edward Witten]] described the work as “very unexpected" and said that "it is difficult to guess what will happen or what the lessons will turn out to be."&lt;ref name="Quandra20130917"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/|title=A Jewel at the Heart of Quantum Physics|author=Natalie Wolchover|publisher=Quanta Magazine|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
When [[subatomic particle]]s interact, different outcomes are possible. The evolution of the various possibilities is called a "tree" and the probability of a given outcome is called its [[scattering amplitude]]. According to the principle of [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]], the sum of the probabilities for every possible outcome is 1.

The [[On shell and off shell|on-shell]] scattering process "tree" may be described by a positive [[Grassmannian]], a structure in [[algebraic geometry]] analogous to a [[convex polytope]], that generalizes the idea of a [[simplex]] in [[projective space]].{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Bourjaily|Cachazo|Goncharov|2012}} A [[polytope]] is the ''n''-dimensional analogue of a 3-dimensional [[polyhedron]], the values being calculated in this case are scattering amplitudes, and so the object is called an ''amplituhedron''.{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Trnka|2014}}

Using [[twistor theory]], [[BCFW recursion]] relations involved in the scattering process may be represented as a small number of twistor diagrams. These diagrams effectively provide the recipe for constructing the positive Grassmannian, i.e. the amplituhedron, which may be captured in a single equation.{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Bourjaily|Cachazo|Goncharov|2012}} The scattering amplitude can thus be thought of as the volume of a certain polytope, the positive Grassmannian, in momentum twistor space.{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Trnka|2013}}

When the volume of the amplituhedron is calculated in the [[1/N expansion|planar limit]] of  [[N = 4 super Yang–Mills|''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 ''D''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]], it describes the [[scattering amplitude]]s of [[subatomic particles]].{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Trnka|2014}} The amplituhedron thus provides a more intuitive geometric model for calculations whose underlying principles were until then highly abstract.{{sfn|4 gravitons and a grad student|2013}}

The twistor-based representation provides a recipe for constructing specific cells in the Grassmannian which assemble to form a positive Grassmannian, i.e. the representation describes a specific [[cellular decomposition|cell decomposition]] of the positive Grassmannian.

The recursion relations can be resolved in many different ways, each giving rise to a different representation, with the final amplitude expressed as a sum of on-shell processes in different ways as well. Therefore, any given on-shell representation of scattering amplitudes is not unique, but all such representations of a given interaction yield the same amplituhedron.{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Trnka|2014}}

The twistor approach is relatively abstract. While amplituhedron theory provides an underlying geometric model, the geometrical space is not physical spacetime and is also best understood as abstract.&lt;ref name="ananth2017"&gt;Ananthaswamy, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==

The twistor approach simplifies calculations of particle interactions. In a conventional [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbative]] approach to quantum field theory, such interactions may require the calculation of thousands of [[Feynman diagrams]], most describing off-shell "virtual" particles which have no directly observable existence.  In contrast, [[twistor theory]] provides an approach in which scattering amplitudes can be computed in a way that yields much simpler expressions.&lt;ref name=drum20130918&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/09/space-time-illusion-amplituhedron|title=Maybe Space-Time Is Just an Illusion|author=Kevin Drum|publisher=Mother Jones|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amplituhedron theory calculates scattering amplitudes without referring to such virtual particles. This undermines the case for even a transient, unobservable existence for such virtual particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GraduatePhysics|title=Nima Arkani-Hamed - Physics and Mathematics for the End of Spacetime|date=2016-07-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1-QDXReDTU|accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ananth2017"/&gt;

The geometric nature of the theory suggests in turn that the nature of the universe, in both classical [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[spacetime]] and [[quantum mechanics]], may be described with [[geometry]].&lt;ref name="ananth2017"/&gt;

Calculations can be done without assuming the quantum mechanical properties of [[Principle of locality|locality]] and [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity]]. In amplituhedron theory, locality and unitarity arise as a direct consequence of positivity.{{clarify|reason=what is positivity in this context?|date=April 2017}} They are encoded in the positive geometry of the amplituhedron, via the singularity structure of the integrand for scattering amplitudes.{{sfn|Arkani-Hamed|Trnka|2014}} Arkani-Hamed suggests this is why amplituhedron theory simplifies scattering-amplitude calculations: In the Feynman-diagrams approach, locality is manifest, whereas in the amplituhedron approach, it is implicit.&lt;ref&gt;Musser, George (2015). ''Spooky Action at a Distance'', pp. 40–41. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York. {{ISBN|9780374536619}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the planar limit of the ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory is a [[toy theory]] that does not describe the real world, the relevance of this technique for more realistic quantum field theories is currently unknown, but it provides promising directions for research into theories about the real world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12770">In [[geometry]] and [[combinatorics]], an '''arrangement of hyperplanes''' is an [[arrangement (space partition)|arrangement]] of a finite set ''A'' of [[hyperplane]]s in a [[linear space|linear]], [[affine geometry|affine]], or [[projective geometry|projective]] space ''S''.  
Questions about a hyperplane arrangement ''A'' generally concern geometrical, topological, or other properties of the '''complement''', ''M''(''A''), which is the set that remains when the hyperplanes are removed from the whole space.  One may ask how these properties are related to the arrangement and its intersection semilattice.
The '''intersection [[semilattice]]''' of ''A'', written ''L''(''A''), is the set of all [[Euclidean subspace|subspaces]] that are obtained by intersecting some of the hyperplanes; among these subspaces are ''S'' itself, all the individual hyperplanes, all intersections of pairs of hyperplanes, etc. (excluding, in the affine case, the empty set).  These subspaces are called the '''flats''' of ''A''.  The intersection semilattice ''L''(''A'') is partially ordered by ''reverse inclusion''.  

If the whole space ''S'' is 2-dimensional, the hyperplanes are [[line (mathematics)|line]]s; such an arrangement is often called an '''[[arrangement of lines]]'''.  Historically, real arrangements of lines were the first arrangements investigated.  If ''S'' is 3-dimensional one has an '''arrangement of planes'''.
[[File:Arrangement hyperplans.png|thumbnail|A hyperplane arrangement in space]]
== General theory ==
=== The intersection semilattice and the matroid ===

The intersection semilattice ''L''(''A'') is a meet semilattice and more specifically is a [[geometric semilattice]]. If the arrangement is linear or projective, or if the intersection of all hyperplanes is nonempty, the intersection lattice is a [[geometric lattice]].
(This is why the semilattice must be ordered by reverse inclusion&amp;mdash;rather than by inclusion, which might seem more natural but would not yield a geometric (semi)lattice.)

When ''L''(''A'') is a lattice, the [[matroid]] of ''A'', written ''M''(''A''), has ''A'' for its ground set and has rank function ''r''(''S'') := codim(''I''), where ''S'' is any subset of ''A'' and ''I'' is the intersection of the hyperplanes in ''S''.  In general, when ''L''(''A'') is a semilattice, there is an analogous matroid-like structure that might be called a [[semimatroid]], which is a generalization of a matroid (and has the same relationship to the intersection semilattice as does the matroid to the lattice in the lattice case), but is not a matroid if ''L''(''A'') is not a lattice.

=== Polynomials ===

For a subset ''B'' of ''A'', let us define ''f''(''B'') := the intersection of the hyperplanes in ''B''; this is ''S'' if ''B'' is empty.  
The '''characteristic polynomial of''' ''A'', written ''p&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''y''), can be defined by 

:&lt;math&gt;p_A(y) := \sum_B (-1)^{|B|}y^{\dim f(B)},&lt;/math&gt;

summed over all subsets ''B'' of ''A'' except, in the affine case, subsets whose intersection is empty.  (The dimension of the empty set is defined to be &amp;minus;1.)  This polynomial helps to solve some basic questions; see below.
Another polynomial associated with ''A'' is the '''Whitney-number polynomial''' ''w&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'', ''y''), defined by

:&lt;math&gt;w_A(x,y) := \sum_B x^{n-\dim f(B)} \sum_C (-1)^{|C-B|}y^{\dim f(C)},&lt;/math&gt;

summed over ''B'' ⊆ ''C'' ⊆ ''A'' such that ''f''(''B'') is nonempty.

Being a geometric lattice or semilattice, ''L''(''A'') has a characteristic polynomial, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''(''A'')&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''), which has an extensive theory (see [[Matroid#Characteristic_polynomial|matroid]]).  Thus it is good to know that ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'') = ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''(''A'')&lt;/sub&gt;(''y''), where ''i'' is the smallest dimension of any flat, except that in the projective case it equals ''y''&lt;sup&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''L''(''A'')&lt;/sub&gt;(''y'').  
The Whitney-number polynomial of ''A'' is similarly related to that of ''L''(''A'').  
(The empty set is excluded from the semilattice in the affine case specifically so that these relationships will be valid.)

=== The Orlik–Solomon algebra ===

The intersection semilattice determines another combinatorial invariant of the arrangement, the [[Orlik–Solomon algebra]]. To define it, fix a commutative subring ''K'' of the base field, and form the exterior algebra ''E'' of the vector space
:&lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{H \in A} K e_H &lt;/math&gt;
generated by the hyperplanes.
A [[chain complex]] structure is defined on ''E'' with the usual boundary operator &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;.
The Orlik–Solomon algebra is then the quotient of ''E'' by the [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by elements of the form &lt;math&gt;e_{H_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge e_{H_p}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;H_1, \dots, H_p&lt;/math&gt; have an empty intersection) and by boundaries of elements of the same form for which &lt;math&gt;H_1 \cap \cdots \cap H_p&lt;/math&gt; has [[codimension]] less than ''p''.

== Real arrangements ==

In [[real number|real]] [[affine space]], the complement is disconnected: it is made up of separate pieces called '''cells''' or '''regions''' or '''chambers''', each of which is either a bounded region that is a [[Convex polygon|convex]] [[polytope]], or an unbounded region that is a convex [[polyhedron#General|polyhedral]] region which goes off to infinity.  
Each flat of ''A'' is also divided into pieces by the hyperplanes that do not contain the flat; these pieces are called the '''faces''' of ''A''.  
The regions are faces because the whole space is a flat.  
The faces of codimension 1 may be called the '''facets''' of ''A''.  
The '''face semilattice''' of an arrangement is the set of all faces, ordered by ''inclusion''.  Adding an extra top element to the face semilattice gives the '''face lattice'''.

In two dimensions (i.e., in the real affine [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]) each region is a convex [[polygon]] (if it is bounded) or a convex polygonal region which goes off to infinity.  
* As an example, if the arrangement consists of three parallel lines, the intersection semilattice consists of the plane and the three lines, but not the empty set.  There are four regions, none of them bounded.  
* If we add a line crossing the three parallels, then the intersection semilattice consists of the plane, the four lines, and the three points of intersection.  There are eight regions, still none of them bounded.  
* If we add one more line, parallel to the last, then there are 12 regions, of which two are bounded [[parallelogram]]s.

Typical problems about an arrangement in ''n''-dimensional real space is to say how many regions there are, or how many faces of dimension 4, or how many bounded regions.  These questions can be answered just from the intersection semilattice.  For instance, two basic theorems are that the number of regions of an affine arrangement equals (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;minus;1) and the number of bounded regions equals (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(1).  Similarly, the number of ''k''-dimensional faces or bounded faces can be read off as the coefficient of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; in (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; w&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; (&amp;minus;''x'', &amp;minus;1) or (&amp;minus;1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''w''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;minus;''x'', 1).

{{harvtxt|Meiser|1993}} designed a fast algorithm to determine the face of an arrangement of hyperplanes containing an input point.

Another question about an arrangement in real space is to decide how many regions are [[simplex|simplices]] (the ''n''-dimensional generalization of [[triangle]]s and [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]]).  This cannot be answered based solely on the intersection semilattice. The [[McMullen problem]] asks for the smallest arrangement of a given dimension in general position in [[real projective space]] for which there does not exist a cell touched by all hyperplanes.

A real linear arrangement has, besides its face semilattice, a '''[[poset]] of regions''', a different one for each region.  This poset is formed by choosing an arbitrary base region, ''B''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and associating with each region ''R'' the set ''S''(''R'') consisting of the hyperplanes that separate ''R'' from ''B''. The regions are partially ordered so that ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; if ''S''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R'') contains ''S''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R'').  In the special case when the hyperplanes arise from a [[root system]], the resulting poset is the corresponding [[Weyl group]] with the weak Bruhat order. In general, the poset of regions is [[ranked poset|ranked]] by the number of separating hyperplanes and its [[Incidence algebra|Möbius function]] has been computed {{harv|Edelman|1984}}.

Vadim Schechtman and [[Alexander Varchenko]] introduced a matrix indexed by the regions. The matrix element for the region &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_j&lt;/math&gt; is given by the product of indeterminate variables &lt;math&gt;a_H&lt;/math&gt; for every hyperplane H that separates these two regions. If these variables are specialized to be all value q, then this is called the q-matrix (over the Euclidean domain &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}[q]&lt;/math&gt;) for the arrangement and much information is contained in its [[Smith normal form]].

==Complex arrangements==

In [[complex number|complex]] affine space (which is hard to visualize because even the complex affine plane has four real dimensions), the complement is connected (all one piece) with holes where the hyperplanes were removed.

A typical problem about an arrangement in complex space is to describe the holes.

The basic theorem about complex arrangements is that the [[cohomology]] of the complement ''M''(''A'') is completely determined by the intersection semilattice.  To be precise, the cohomology ring of ''M''(''A'') (with integer coefficients) is [[isomorphic]] to the Orlik–Solomon algebra on '''Z'''.

The isomorphism can be described rather explicitly, and gives a presentation of the cohomology in terms of generators and relations, where generators are represented (in the [[de Rham cohomology]]) as logarithmic [[differential form]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2\pi i}\frac{d\alpha}{\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; any linear form defining the generic hyperplane of the arrangement.

==Technicalities==

Sometimes it is convenient to allow the '''degenerate hyperplane''', which is the whole space ''S'', to belong to an arrangement.  If ''A'' contains the degenerate hyperplane, then it has no regions because the complement is empty.  However, it still has flats, an intersection semilattice, and faces.  The preceding discussion assumes the degenerate hyperplane is not in the arrangement.

Sometimes one wants to allow repeated hyperplanes in the arrangement.  We did not consider this possibility in the preceding discussion, but it makes no material difference.

In [[mathematics]], the '''box-counting [[content (measure theory)|content]]''' is an analog of [[Minkowski content]].

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a bounded subset of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^m&lt;/math&gt; such that the [[box-counting dimension]] &lt;math&gt;D_B&lt;/math&gt; exists.
The upper and lower box-counting contents of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{B}^*(A) := \limsup_{x \rightarrow \infty} 
\frac{N_B(A, x)}{x^{D_B}}\quad\quad \text{and}
\quad\quad \mathcal{B}_*(A) := \liminf_{x \rightarrow \infty} 
\frac{N_B(A, x)}{x^{D_B}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_B(A, x)&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum number of disjoint closed balls with centers
&lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; and radii &lt;math&gt;x^{-1} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}^*(A) = \mathcal{B}_*(A)&lt;/math&gt;, then the common value, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(A)&lt;/math&gt;, is called the ''box-counting content'' of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \mathcal{B}_*(A) &lt; \mathcal{B}^*(A) &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''box-counting measurable''. 

== Examples ==
Let &lt;math&gt;I=[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; denote the unit interval.
Note that the box-counting dimension &lt;math&gt;\dim_BI&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Minkowski dimension]] &lt;math&gt;\dim_MI&lt;/math&gt; coincide with a common value of 1; i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\dim_BI=\dim_MI=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Now observe that &lt;math&gt;N_B(I, x) = \lfloor x/2\rfloor + 1&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lfloor y \rfloor&lt;/math&gt; denotes the integer part of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is ''box-counting measurable'' with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{B}(I) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

By contrast, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is [[Minkowski measurable]] with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}(I) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

In a [[linear panel]] data setting, it can be desirable to estimate the magnitude of the [[Fixed Effects]], as they provide measures of the [[unobserved components]]. For instance, in [[wage equation]] regressions, Fixed Effects capture [[Aptitude|ability]] measures that are constant over time, such as motivation. [[Gary Chamberlain|Chamberlain]]'s approach to unobserved effects models is a way of estimating the linear unobserved effects, under Fixed Effect (rather than [[Random Effects]]) assumptions, in the following unobserved effects model

''y&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt; = x&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;b + c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + u&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;	''																			(1)

where ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the unobserved effect and ''x&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;'' contains only time-varying [[explanatory variables]].&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than [[differencing out]] the unobserved effect ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', Chamberlain proposed to replace it with the [[linear projection]] of it onto the explanatory variables in all time periods. Specifically, this leads to the following equation

''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = d + x&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + x&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + x&lt;sub&gt;iT&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;	''														(2)

where the conditional distribution of ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''  given ''x&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;'' is unspecified, as is standard in Fixed Effects models. Combining equations (1) and (2) then gives rise to the following model.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, G. (1982): Multivariate Regression Models for Panel Data. Journal of Econometrics (18), pp. 5-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain, G. (1984): Panel Data. Handbook of Econometrics, Volume 2, ed. Z. Griliches and M. D. Intriligator. Amsterdam: North Holland, pp. 1247-1318&lt;/ref&gt;

''y&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt; = d + x&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + x&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt; (b+λ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; ) + ... + x&lt;sub&gt;iT&lt;/sub&gt; λ&lt;sub&gt;Tb&lt;/sub&gt; + e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + u&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;''												(3)

An important advantage of this approach is the [[computational]] requirement. Chamberlain uses [[minimum distance estimation]], but a [[Mixture model#Gaussian mixture model|GMM]] approach would be another valid way of estimating this model. The latter approach also gives rise to a larger number of instruments than moment conditions, which leads to useful [[overidentifying restrictions]] that can be used to test the [[strict exogeneity restrictions]] imposed by many [[Static variable|static]] Fixed Effects models.&lt;ref&gt;Wooldridge, J. (2002): Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar approaches have been proposed to model the unobserved effect. For instance, Mundlak follows a very similar approach, but rather projects the unobserved effect ''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' onto the average of all ''x&lt;sub&gt;it&lt;/sub&gt;'' across all T time periods, more specifically &lt;ref&gt;Mundlak, Y. (1978): On the Pooling of Time Series and Cross Section Data. Econometrica (46), pp. 69-85&lt;/ref&gt;

''c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = d + &lt;span style="text-decoration:overline"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;λ + e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''																				(4)

It can be shown that the Chamberlain method is a generalization of Mundlak's model. The Chamberlain method has been popular in [[empirical work]], ranging from studies trying to estimate the [[causal]] returns to [[Trade union|union]] members &lt;ref&gt;Card, D. (1996): The effect of unions on the structure of wages: a longitudinal analysis. Econometrica (64), pp. 957-979&lt;/ref&gt; to studies investigating [[growth convergence]].&lt;ref&gt;Islam, N. (1995): Growth Empirics: A Panel Data Approach. The Quarterly Journal of Economics (110), pp. 1127-1170&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In [[complex geometry]] and [[complex analysis|analysis]], the notion of [[convex function|convexity]] and its generalizations play an important role in understanding [[function (mathematics)|function]] behavior. Examples of classes of functions with a rich structure are, in addition to the convex functions, the [[subharmonic function]]s and the [[plurisubharmonic function]]s. Geometrically, these classes of functions correspond to convex domains and pseudoconvex domains, but there are also other types of domains, for instance lineally convex domains which can be generalized using [[convex analysis]]. A great deal is already known about these domains, but there remain some fascinating, unsolved problems. This theme is mainly theoretical, but there are computational aspects of the domains studied, and these computational aspects are certainly worthy of further study.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13021">In [[mathematics]], more specifically [[measure theory]], there are various notions of the '''convergence of measures'''. For an intuitive general sense of what is meant by ''convergence in measure'', consider a sequence of measures μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on a space, sharing a common collection of measurable sets. Such a sequence might represent an attempt to construct 'better and better' approximations to a desired measure μ that is difficult to obtain directly. The meaning of 'better and better' is subject to all the usual caveats for taking [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]s; for any error tolerance ε &gt; 0 we require there be ''N'' sufficiently large for ''n'' ≥ ''N'' to ensure the 'difference' between μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and μ is smaller than ε. Various notions of convergence specify precisely what the word 'difference' should mean in that description; these notions are not equivalent to one another, and vary in strength.

Three of the most common notions of convergence are described below.

==Informal descriptions==
This section attempts to provide a rough intuitive description of three notions of convergence, using terminology developed in [[calculus]] courses; this section is necessarily imprecise as well as inexact, and the reader should refer to the formal clarifications in subsequent sections. In particular, the descriptions here do not address the possibility that the measure of some sets could be infinite, or that the underlying space could exhibit pathological behavior, and additional technical assumptions are needed for some of the statements. The statements in this section are however all correct if &lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of probability measures on a [[Polish space]].

The various notions of convergence formalize the assertion that the 'average value' of each 'sufficiently nice' function should converge:

:&lt;math&gt;\int f\, d\mu_n \to \int f\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt;

To formalize this requires a careful specification of the set of functions under consideration and how uniform the convergence should be.

The notion of ''weak convergence'' requires this convergence to take place for every continuous bounded function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. 
This notion treats convergence for different functions ''f'' independently of one another, ''i.e.'' different functions ''f'' may require different values of ''N''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''n'' to be approximated equally well (thus, convergence is non-uniform in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;).

The notion of ''strong convergence'' formalizes the assertion that the measure of each measurable set should converge:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_n(A) \to \mu(A)&lt;/math&gt;

Again, no uniformity over the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is required.
Intuitively, considering integrals of 'nice' functions, this notion provides more uniformity than weak convergence. As a matter of fact, when considering sequences of measures with uniformly bounded
variation on a [[Polish space]], strong convergence implies the convergence  &lt;math&gt;\int f\, d\mu_n \to \int f\, d\mu&lt;/math&gt; for any bounded measurable function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.
As before,   this convergence is non-uniform in &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;

The notion of ''total variation convergence'' formalizes the assertion that the measure of all measurable sets should converge ''uniformly'', i.e. for every &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists ''N'' 
such that &lt;math&gt;|\mu_n(A) - \mu(A)| &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for every ''n &gt; N'' and for every measurable set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. As before, this implies convergence of integrals against bounded measurable functions, but this time
convergence is uniform over all functions bounded by any fixed constant.

==Total variation convergence of measures==
This is the strongest notion of convergence shown on this page and is defined as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[measurable space]]. The [[total variation]] distance between two (positive) measures μ and ν is then given by

:&lt;math&gt; \left \|\mu- \nu \right \|_\text{TV} = \sup_f \left \{ \int_X f \, d\mu - \int_X f \, d\nu \right \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the supremum is taken over ''f'' ranging over the set of all [[measurable function]]s from ''X'' to [−1,&amp;nbsp;1]. This is in contrast, for example, to the [[Wasserstein metric]], where the definition is of the same form, but the supremum is taken over ''f'' ranging over the set of measurable functions from ''X'' to [−1,&amp;nbsp;1] which have [[Lipschitz constant]] at most&amp;nbsp;1; and also in contrast to the [[Radon metric]], where the supremum is taken over ''f'' ranging over the set of continuous functions from ''X'' to [−1,&amp;nbsp;1]. In the case where ''X'' is a [[Polish space]], the total variation metric coincides with the Radon metric.

If μ and ν are both [[probability measure]]s, then the total variation distance is also given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left \|\mu- \nu \right \|_{TV} = 2\cdot\sup_{A\in \mathcal{F}} | \mu (A) - \nu (A) |.&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence between these two definitions can be seen as a particular case of the [[transportation theory (mathematics)#Monge and Kantorovich formulations|Monge-Kantorovich duality]].  From the two definitions above, it is clear that the total variation distance between probability measures is always between 0 and 2.

To illustrate the meaning of the total variation distance, consider the following thought experiment. Assume that we are given two probability measures μ and ν, as well as a random variable ''X''. We know that ''X'' has law either μ or ν but we do not know which one of the two. Assume that these two measures have prior probabilities 0.5 each of being the true law of ''X''. Assume now that we are given ''one'' single sample distributed according to the law of ''X'' and that we are then asked to guess which one of the two distributions describes that law. The quantity

:&lt;math&gt;{2+\|\mu-\nu\|_\text{TV} \over 4}&lt;/math&gt;

then provides a sharp upper bound on the prior probability that our guess will be correct.

Given the above definition of total variation distance, a sequence μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of measures defined on the same measure space is said to '''converge''' to a measure ''μ'' in total variation distance if for every ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there exists an ''N'' such that for all ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''N'', one has that&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madras |first=Neil |author2=Sezer, Deniz|title=Quantitative bounds for Markov chain convergence: Wasserstein and total variation distances|journal=Bernoulli |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=882–908 |date=25 Feb 2011 |arxiv=1102.5245|doi=10.3150/09-BEJ238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\|\mu_n - \mu\|_\text{TV} &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

==Strong convergence of measures==
For &lt;math&gt;(X, \mathcal{F})&lt;/math&gt; a [[measurable space]], a sequence μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is said to converge strongly to a limit ''μ'' if

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \mu_n(A) = \mu(A)&lt;/math&gt;

for every set &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, as a consequence of the [[Riemann–Lebesgue lemma]], the sequence μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of measures on the interval [−1, 1] given by μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''dx'') = (1+ sin(''nx''))''dx'' converges strongly to Lebesgue measure, but it does not converge in total variation.

== Weak convergence of measures ==
In [[mathematics]] and [[statistics]], '''weak convergence''' is one of many types of convergence relating to the convergence of [[measure theory|measures]]. It depends on a topology on the underlying space and thus is not a purely measure theoretic notion.

There are several equivalent [[definition]]s of weak convergence of a sequence of measures, some of which are (apparently) more general than others. The equivalence of these conditions is sometimes known as the '''Portmanteau theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Achim |last=Klenke |title=Probability Theory |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |isbn=978-1-84800-047-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Definition.''' Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[metric space]] with its [[Borel sigma algebra|Borel &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. A bounded sequence of positive [[probability measure]]s &lt;math&gt;P_n\, (n = 1, 2, \dots)&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;(S, \Sigma)&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''converge weakly to the finite positive measure''' &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; (denoted &lt;math&gt;P_n\Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;) if any of the following equivalent conditions is true (here &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}_n&lt;/math&gt; denotes expectation or the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm with respect to &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}&lt;/math&gt; denotes expectation or the &lt;math&gt;L^1&lt;/math&gt; norm with respect to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;):

* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}_n[f] \to \operatorname{E}[f]&lt;/math&gt; for all [[Bounded function|bounded]], [[continuous function]]s &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}_n[f] \to \operatorname{E}[f]&lt;/math&gt; for all bounded and [[Lipschitz function]]s &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\limsup \operatorname{E}_n[f] \to \operatorname{E}[f]&lt;/math&gt; for every [[upper semi-continuous]] function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; bounded from above;
* &lt;math&gt;\liminf \operatorname{E}_n[f] \to \operatorname{E}[f]&lt;/math&gt; for every [[lower semi-continuous]] function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; bounded from below;
* &lt;math&gt;\limsup P_n(C) \le P(C)&lt;/math&gt; for all [[closed set]]s &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; of space &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\liminf P_n(U) \ge P(U)&lt;/math&gt; for all [[open set]]s &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of space &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim P_n(A) = P(A)&lt;/math&gt; for all [[continuity set]]s &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of measure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case &lt;math&gt;S \equiv \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; with its usual topology, if &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[cumulative distribution function]]s of the measures &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, then &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; converges weakly to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} F_n(x) = F(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all points &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; at which &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

For example, the sequence where &lt;math&gt;P_n&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac measure]] located at &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; converges weakly to the Dirac measure located at 0 (if we view these as measures on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt; with the usual topology), but it does not converge strongly. This is intuitively clear: we only know that &lt;math&gt;1/n&lt;/math&gt; is "close" to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; because of the topology of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

This definition of weak convergence can be extended for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; any [[metrizable]] [[topological space]]. It also defines a weak topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all probability measures defined on &lt;math&gt;(S,\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;.  The weak topology is generated by the following basis of open sets:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ U_{\phi, x, \delta} \left| \begin{array}{c} \phi \colon S \to \mathbf{R} \text{ is bounded and continuous,} \\ x \in \mathbf{R} \text{ and } \delta &gt; 0 \end{array} \right. \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;U_{\phi, x, \delta} := \left\{ \mu \in \boldsymbol{P}(S) \left| \left| \int_{S} \phi \,  \mathrm{d} \mu - x \right| &lt; \delta \right. \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is also [[separable space|separable]], then &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; is metrizable and separable, for example by the [[Lévy–Prokhorov metric]], if &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is also compact or [[Polish space|Polish]], so is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is separable, it naturally embeds into &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}(S)&lt;/math&gt; as the (closed) set of [[dirac measure]]s, and its [[convex hull]] is [[Dense set|dense]].

There are many "arrow notations" for this kind of convergence: the most frequently used are &lt;math&gt;P_{n} \Rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P_{n} \rightharpoonup P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{n} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{D}} P.&lt;/math&gt;.

===Weak convergence of random variables===
{{Main article|Convergence of random variables}}
Let &lt;math&gt;(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})&lt;/math&gt; be a [[probability space]] and '''X''' be a metric space. If {{nowrap|''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''X'':&amp;thinsp;Ω → '''X'''}} is a sequence of [[random variable]]s then ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is said to '''converge weakly''' (or '''in distribution''' or '''in law''') to ''X'' as {{nowrap|''n'' → ∞}} if the sequence of [[pushforward measure]]s (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;('''P''') converges weakly to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;('''P''') in the sense of weak convergence of measures on '''X''', as defined above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5231">{{about|correlation in projective geometry||Correlation (disambiguation)}}

In [[projective geometry]], a '''correlation''' is a transformation of a ''d''-dimensional [[projective space]] that maps [[Projective space#Projective subspace|subspace]]s of dimension ''k'' to subspaces of dimension {{nowrap|''d'' − ''k'' − 1}}, reversing [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] and preserving [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]]. Correlations are also called '''reciprocities''' or '''reciprocal transformations'''.

==In two dimensions==
In the [[real projective plane]], points and lines are [[duality (projective geometry)|dual]] to each other. As expressed by Coxeter,
:A correlation is a point-to-line and a line-to-point transformation that preserves the relation of incidence in accordance with the principle of duality. Thus it transforms [[projective range|ranges]] into [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]]s, pencils into ranges, quadrangles into quadrilaterals, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[H. S. M. Coxeter]] (1974) ''Projective Geometry'', second edition, page 57, [[University of Toronto Press]] {{ISBN|0-8020-2104-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given a line ''m'' and ''P'' a point not on ''m'', an elementary correlation is obtained as follows: for every ''Q'' on ''m'' form the line ''PQ''. The [[inverse function|inverse]] correlation starts with the pencil on ''P'': for any line ''q'' in this pencil take the point {{nowrap|''m'' ∩ ''q''}}. The [[function composition|composition]] of two correlations that share the same pencil is a [[perspectivity]].

==In three dimensions==
In a 3-dimensional projective space a correlation maps a point to a [[plane (geometry)|plane]]. As stated in one textbook:&lt;ref&gt;[[J. G. Semple]] and G. T. Kneebone (1952) ''Algebraic Projective Geometry'', p 360, [[Clarendon Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:If ''&amp;kappa;'' is such a correlation, every point ''P'' is transformed by it into a plane {{nowrap|1=''&amp;pi;''′ = ''&amp;kappa;P''}}, and conversely, every point ''P'' arises from a unique plane ''&amp;pi;''′ by the inverse transformation ''&amp;kappa;''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Three-dimensional correlations also transform lines into lines, so they may be considered to be [[collineation]]s of the two spaces.

==In higher dimensions==
In general ''n''-dimensional projective space, a correlation takes a point to a [[hyperplane]]. This context was described by Paul Yale:
:A correlation of the projective space '''P'''(''V'') is an inclusion-reversing permutation of the proper subspaces of '''P'''(''V'').&lt;ref&gt;Paul B. Yale (1968, 1988. 2004) ''Geometry and Symmetry'', chapter 6.9 Correlations and semi-bilinear forms, [[Dover Publications]] {{ISBN|0-486-43835-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He proves a theorem stating that a correlation ''φ'' interchanges joins and intersections, and for any projective subspace ''W'' of '''P'''(''V''), the dimension of the image of ''W'' under ''φ'' is {{nowrap|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1) &amp;minus; dim ''W''}}, where ''n'' is the dimension of the [[vector space]] ''V'' used to produce the projective space '''P'''(''V'').

==Existence of correlations==
Correlations can exist only if the space is self-dual.  For dimensions 3 and higher, self-duality is easy to test: A coordinatizing [[skewfield]] exists and self-duality fails if and only if the skewfield is not isomorphic to its opposite.

==Special types of correlations==
===Polarity===
If a correlation ''φ'' is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (that is, two applications of the correlation equals the identity: {{nowrap|1=''φ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''P'') = ''P''}} for all points ''P'') then it is called a [[Pole and polar|polarity]]. Polarities of projective spaces lead to [[polar space]]s, which are defined by taking the collection of all subspace which are contained in their image under the polarity.

===Natural correlation===
There is a natural correlation induced between a projective space '''P'''(''V'') and its dual '''P'''(''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;) by the [[natural pairing]] {{nowrap|{{langle}}&amp;sdot;,&amp;sdot;{{rangle}}}} between the underlying vector spaces ''V'' and its [[dual space|dual]] ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, where every subspace ''W'' of ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is mapped to its [[orthogonal complement]] ''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; in ''V'', defined as {{nowrap|1=''W''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = {''v'' ∈ ''V'' {{!}} {{langle}}''w'', ''v''{{rangle}} = 0, ∀''w'' ∈ ''W''}.}}{{refn|{{citation|author=Irving Kaplansky|year=1974|origyear=1969|title=Linear Algebra and Geometry|edition=2nd|page=104}}}}

Composing this natural correlation with an isomorphism of projective spaces induced by a semilinear map produces a correlation of '''P'''(''V'') to itself.  In this way, every nondegenerate semilinear map {{nowrap|''V'' → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}} induces a correlation of a projective space to itself.

[[Image:Unit disk graph.svg|thumb|right|A collection of [[circle]]s and the corresponding [[unit disk graph]]]]
'''Discrete geometry''' and '''combinatorial geometry''' are branches of [[geometry]] that study [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] properties and constructive methods of [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] geometric objects.  Most questions in discrete geometry involve [[finite set|finite]] or [[Discrete space|discrete]] [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of basic geometric objects, such as [[point (geometry)|point]]s, [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s, [[circle]]s, [[sphere]]s, [[polygon]]s, and so forth.  The subject focuses on the combinatorial properties of these objects, such as how they [[intersection (set theory)|intersect]] one another, or how they may be arranged to cover a larger object.

Discrete geometry has a large overlap with [[convex geometry]] and [[computational geometry]], and is closely related to subjects such as [[finite geometry]], [[combinatorial optimization]], [[digital geometry]], [[discrete differential geometry]], [[geometric graph theory]], [[toric geometry]], and [[combinatorial topology]].

==History==
Although [[polyhedra]] and [[tessellation]]s had been studied for many years by people such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], modern discrete geometry has its origins in the late 19th century.  Early topics studied were: the density of [[circle packing]]s by [[Axel Thue|Thue]], [[projective configuration]]s by Reye and [[Ernst Steinitz|Steinitz]], the [[geometry of numbers]] by Minkowski, and [[Four colour theorem|map colourings]] by Tait, Heawood, and [[Hadwiger]].

[[László Fejes Tóth]], [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H.S.M. Coxeter]] and [[Paul Erdős]], laid the foundations of ''discrete geometry''.

==Topics in discrete geometry==

===Polyhedra and polytopes===
{{main|Polyhedron|Polytope}}
A '''polytope''' is a geometric object with flat sides, which exists in any general number of dimensions. A [[polygon]] is a polytope in two dimensions, a [[polyhedron]] in three dimensions, and so on in higher dimensions (such as a [[4-polytope]] in four dimensions). Some theories further generalize the idea to include such objects as unbounded polytopes ([[apeirotope]]s and [[tessellation]]s), and [[abstract polytope]]s.

The following are some of the aspects of polytopes studied in discrete geometry:
*[[Polyhedral combinatorics]]
*[[Convex lattice polytope|Lattice polytopes]]
*[[Ehrhart polynomial]]s
*[[Pick's theorem]]
*[[Hirsch conjecture]]

===Packings, coverings and tilings===
{{main|circle packing|tessellation}}

Packings, coverings, and tilings are all ways of arranging uniform objects (typically circles, spheres, or tiles) in a regular way on a surface or [[manifold]].

A '''sphere packing''' is an arrangement of non-overlapping [[sphere]]s within a containing space. The spheres considered are usually all of identical size, and the space is usually three-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]]. However, sphere [[packing problem]]s can be generalised to consider unequal spheres, ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space (where the problem becomes [[circle packing]] in two dimensions, or [[hypersphere]] packing in higher dimensions) or to [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] spaces such as [[hyperbolic space]].

A '''tessellation''' of a flat surface is the tiling of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In [[mathematics]], tessellations can be generalized to higher dimensions.

Specific topics in this area include:
*[[Circle packing]]s
*[[Sphere packing]]s
*[[Kepler conjecture]]
*[[Quasicrystal]]s
*[[Aperiodic tiling]]s
*[[Periodic graph (geometry)|Periodic graph]]
*[[Finite subdivision rule]]s

===Structural rigidity and flexibility===
{{main|Structural rigidity}}
[[File:Structural rigidity basic examples.svg|thumb|150px|Graphs are drawn as rods connected by rotating hinges. The [[cycle graph]] C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; drawn as a square can be tilted over by the blue force into a parallelogram, so it is a flexible graph. K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, drawn as a triangle, cannot be altered by any force that is applied to it, so it is a rigid graph.]]

'''Structural rigidity''' is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial theory]] for predicting the flexibility of ensembles formed by [[rigid body|rigid bodies]] connected by flexible [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkage]]s or [[hinge]]s.

Topics in this area include:
*[[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy's theorem]]
*[[Flexible polyhedron|Flexible polyhedra]]

===Incidence structures===
{{main|Incidence structure}}
[[File:Fano plane with nimber labels.svg|thumb|right|150px|Seven points are elements of seven lines in the [[Fano plane]], an example of an incidence structure.]]

Incidence structures generalize planes (such as [[affine plane (incidence geometry)|affine]], [[projective plane|projective]], and [[Möbius plane]]s) as can be seen from their axiomatic definitions. Incidence structures also generalize the higher-dimensional analogs and the finite structures are sometimes called [[Finite geometry|finite geometries]].

Formally, an '''incidence structure''' is a triple
:&lt;math&gt;C=(P,L,I).\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is a set of "points", ''L'' is a set of "lines" and &lt;math&gt;I \subseteq P \times L&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Incidence (geometry)|incidence]] relation. The elements of &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are called '''flags.''' If
:&lt;math&gt;(p,l) \in I,&lt;/math&gt;

we say that point ''p'' "lies on" line &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

Topics in this area include:
*[[Configuration (geometry)|Configurations]]
*[[Arrangement of lines|Line arrangements]]
*[[Arrangement of hyperplanes|Hyperplane arrangements]]
*[[Building (mathematics)|Buildings]]

===Oriented matroids===
{{main|Oriented matroid}}
An '''oriented matroid''' is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] [[mathematical structure|structure]] that abstracts the properties of [[directed graph]]s and of  arrangements of vectors in a [[vector space]] over an [[ordered field]] (particularly for [[ordered vector space|partially ordered vector space]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Rockafellar]] 1969. Björner et alia, Chapters 1-3. Bokowski, Chapter 1. Ziegler, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, an ordinary (i.e., non-oriented) [[matroid]] abstracts the [[linear independence|dependence]] properties that are common both to  [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], which are not necessarily ''directed'', and to arrangements of vectors over [[field (mathematics)|field]]s, which are not necessarily ''ordered''.&lt;ref&gt;Björner et alia, Chapters 1-3. Bokowski, Chapters 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Because matroids and oriented matroids are abstractions of other mathematical abstractions, nearly all the relevant books are written for mathematical scientists rather than for the general public. For learning about oriented matroids, a good preparation is to study the textbook on [[linear optimization]] by Nering and Tucker, which is infused with oriented-matroid ideas, and then to proceed to Ziegler's lectures on polytopes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometric graph theory===
{{main|Geometric graph theory}}
A '''geometric graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in which the [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] or [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] are associated with [[Geometry|geometric]] objects. Examples include Euclidean graphs, the 1-[[Skeleton (topology)|skeleton]] of a [[polyhedron]] or [[polytope]], [[intersection graphs]], and [[visibility graphs]].

Topics in this area include:
*[[Graph drawing]]
*[[Polyhedral graph]]s
*[[Voronoi diagram]]s and [[Delaunay triangulation]]s

===Simplicial complexes===
{{main|Simplicial complex}}
A '''simplicial complex''' is a [[topological space]] of a certain kind, constructed by "gluing together" [[Point (geometry)|point]]s, [[line segment]]s, [[triangle]]s, and their [[Simplex|''n''-dimensional counterparts]] (see illustration).  Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a [[simplicial set]] appearing in modern simplicial homotopy theory.  The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an [[abstract simplicial complex]].

===Topological combinatorics===
{{main|Topological combinatorics}}
The discipline of combinatorial topology used combinatorial concepts in [[topology]] and in the early 20th century this turned into the field of [[algebraic topology]].

In 1978, the situation was reversed – methods from algebraic topology were used to solve a problem in [[combinatorics]] – when [[László Lovász]] proved the [[Kneser graph|Kneser conjecture]], thus beginning the new study of '''topological combinatorics'''. Lovász's proof used the [[Borsuk-Ulam theorem]] and this theorem retains a prominent role in this new field. This theorem has many equivalent versions and analogs and has been used in the study of [[fair division]] problems.

Topics in this area include:
*[[Sperner's lemma]]
*[[Regular map (graph theory)|Regular maps]]

===Lattices and discrete groups===
{{main|Lattice (discrete group)|discrete group}}
A '''discrete group''' is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' equipped with the [[discrete topology]]. With this topology, ''G'' becomes a [[topological group]]. A '''discrete subgroup''' of a topological group ''G'' is a [[subgroup]] ''H'' whose [[relative topology]] is the discrete one. For example, the [[integer]]s, '''Z''', form a discrete subgroup of the [[real numbers|reals]], '''R''' (with the standard [[Metric space|metric topology]]), but the [[rational number]]s, '''Q''', do not.

A '''lattice''' in a [[locally compact]] [[topological group]] is a [[discrete subgroup]] with the property that the [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] has finite [[invariant measure]]. In the special case of subgroups of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, this amounts to the usual geometric notion of a [[lattice (group)|lattice]], and both the algebraic structure of lattices and the geometry of the totality of all lattices are relatively well understood. Deep results of [[Armand Borel|Borel]], [[Harish-Chandra]], [[George Mostow|Mostow]], [[Tsuneo Tamagawa|Tamagawa]], [[M. S. Raghunathan]], [[Grigory Margulis|Margulis]], [[Robert Zimmer (mathematician)|Zimmer]] obtained from the 1950s through the 1970s provided examples and generalized much of the theory to the setting of [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] [[Lie group]]s and [[semisimple algebraic group]]s over a [[local field]]. In the 1990s, [[Hyman Bass|Bass]] and [[Alexander Lubotzky|Lubotzky]] initiated the study of ''tree lattices'', which remains an active research area.

Topics in this area include:
*[[Reflection group]]s
*[[Triangle group]]s

===Digital geometry===
{{main|Digital geometry}}
'''Digital geometry''' deals with [[discrete space|discrete]] sets (usually discrete [[Point (geometry)|point]] sets) considered to be [[digitizing|digitized]] [[scale model|models]] or [[image]]s of objects of the 2D or 3D [[Euclidean space]].

Simply put, '''digitizing''' is replacing an object by a discrete set of its points. The images we see on the TV screen, the [[raster graphics|raster]] display of a computer, or in newspapers are in fact [[Digital data|digital]] images.

Its main application areas are [[computer graphics]] and [[image analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319120980 Li Chen, Digital and discrete geometry: Theory and Algorithms, Springer, 2014. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discrete differential geometry===
{{main|Discrete differential geometry}}
'''Discrete differential geometry''' is the study of discrete counterparts of notions in [[differential geometry]]. Instead of smooth curves and surfaces, there are [[polygon]]s, [[mesh]]es, and [[simplicial complexes]]. It is used in the study of [[computer graphics]] and [[topological combinatorics]].

Topics in this area include:

*[[Discrete Laplace operator]]
*[[Discrete exterior calculus]]
*[[Discrete Morse theory]]
*[[Topological combinatorics]]
*[[Spectral shape analysis]]
*[[Abstract differential geometry]]
*[[Analysis on fractals]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14606">In [[mathematics]], the '''Douady–Earle extension''', named after [[Adrien Douady]] and Clifford Earle, is a way of extending homeomorphisms of the unit circle in the complex plane to homeomorphisms of the closed unit disk, such that the extension is a diffeomorphism of the open disk. The extension is analytic on the open disk. The extension has an important equivariance property: if the homeomorphism is composed on either side with a Möbius transformation preserving the unit circle the extension is also obtained by composition with the same Möbius transformation. If the homeomorphism is [[quasisymmetric map|quasisymmetric]], the diffeomorphism is [[quasiconformal mapping|quasiconformal]]. An extension for quasisymmetric homeomorphisms had previously been given by [[Lars Ahlfors|Ahlfors]] and [[Arne Beurling]]; a different equivariant construction had been given in 1985 by Pekka Tukia. Equivariant extensions have important applications in [[Teichmüller theory]], for example they lead to a quick proof of the contractibility of the [[Teichmüller space]] of a [[Fuchsian group]].

==Definition==
By the [[Radó–Kneser–Choquet theorem]], the [[Poisson integral]]

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F_f(re^{i\theta}) ={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(\varphi)\cdot {1- r^2\over 1 - 2r\cos (\theta -\varphi) + r^2}\,d\varphi,}&lt;/math&gt;

of a homeomorphism ''f'' of the circle defines a [[harmonic function|harmonic]] diffeomorphism of the unit disk extending ''f''. If ''f'' is [[quasisymmetric map|quasisymmetric]], the extension is not necessarily quasiconformal, i.e. the complex dilatation

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu(z)={\partial_{\overline{z}}F_f\over \partial_z F_f},}&lt;/math&gt;

does not necessarily satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sup_{|z|&lt;1} |\mu(z)| &lt; 1.}&lt;/math&gt;

However ''F'' can be used to define another analytic extension ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; which does satisfy this condition. It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{E(f)=H_{f^{-1}}}&lt;/math&gt;

is the required extension.

For |''a''| &lt; 1 define the Möbius transformation

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g_a(z)= {z-a\over 1- \overline{a}z}.}&lt;/math&gt;

It preserves the unit circle and unit disk sending ''a'' to 0.

If ''g'' is any Möbius transformation preserving the unit circle and disk, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F_{f\circ g} = F_f\circ g.}&lt;/math&gt;

For |''a''| &lt; 1 define

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{w=H_f(a)}&lt;/math&gt;

to be the unique ''w'' with |''w''| &lt; 1 and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F_{g_a\circ f}(w) =0.}&lt;/math&gt;

For |''a''| =1 set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_f(a)=f^{-1}(a).}&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==
*'''Compatibility with Möbius transformations.''' By construction

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H_{g\circ f \circ h} = h^{-1}\circ H_f \circ g^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

:for any Möbius transformations ''g'' and ''h'' preserving the unit circle and disk.

*'''Continuity.''' If |''a''|, |''b''| &lt; 1, define

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Phi(a,b)= F_{g_a\circ f}(b)={1\over 2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} g_a\circ f\circ g_{-b}(e^{i\theta})\, d\theta={1\over 2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \left({f(e^{i\theta}) -b\over 1-\overline{b}f(e^{i\theta})}\right) {1-|a|^2\over |a-e^{i\theta}|^2}\, d\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

:If ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lie in the unit disk and tend to ''z'' and ''w'' and homeomorphisms of the circle are defined by

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f_n=g_{z_n}\circ f \circ g_{-w_n},}&lt;/math&gt;

:then ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends almost everywhere to

**''g''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;−''w''&lt;/sub&gt; if |''z''|, |''w''| &lt; 1;
**''g''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' (''w'') if |''z''| &lt; 1 and |''w''| = 1;
**−''z'' if |''z''| =1 and |''w''| ≤ 1 with ''w'' ≠ ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''z'').

:By the dominated convergence theorem, it follows that Φ(''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) has a non-zero limit if ''w'' ≠ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z''). This implies that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is continuous on the closed unit disk. Indeed otherwise, by compactness, there would be a sequence ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tending to ''z'' in the closed disk, with ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) tending to a limit ''w'' ≠ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z''). But then Φ(''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''w''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 so has limit zero, a contradiction, since ''w'' ≠  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'').

*'''Smoothness and non-vanishing Jacobian on open disk.''' ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is smooth with nowhere vanishing Jacobian on |''z''| &lt; 1. In fact, because of the compatibility with Möbius transformations, it suffices to check that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is smooth near 0 and has non-vanishing derivative at 0.

:If ''f'' has Fourier series

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(e^{i\theta}) = \sum_m a_m e^{im\theta},}&lt;/math&gt;

:then the derivatives of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; at 0 are given by

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\partial_z F_f (0)= a_{1},\,\,\, \partial_{\overline{z}} F_f(0) =a_{-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

:Thus the Jacobian of ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; at 0 is given by

::&lt;math&gt;  \displaystyle{|\partial_z F_f(0)|^2 -  |\partial_{\overline{z}} F_f(0)|^2 = |a_{1}|^2 - |a_{-1}|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

:Since ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, its Jacobian is positive:

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|a_{1}|^2 - |a_{-1}|^2 &gt;0.}&lt;/math&gt;

:The function Φ(''z'',''w'') is analytic and so smooth. Its derivatives at (0,0) are given by

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Phi_z(0,0)=a_{-1},\,\,\Phi_{\overline{z}}(0,0)=a_{1},\,\, \Phi_{w}(0,0) = -1,\,\, \Phi_{\overline{w}}(0,0) = {1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta})^2\, d\theta=b.}&lt;/math&gt;

:Direct calculation shows that

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|\Phi_{w}(0,0)|^2 - |\Phi_{\overline{w}}(0,0)|^2=1-\left|{1\over 2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta})^2 \, d\theta\right|^2 \ge 0.}&lt;/math&gt;

:by the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]. If the right hand side vanished, then equality would occur in the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality forcing

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(e^{i\theta}) =\zeta \overline{f(e^{i\theta})}}&lt;/math&gt;

:for some ζ in '''T''' and for all θ, a contradiction since ''f'' assumes all values in '''T'''. The left hand side is therefore strictly positive and |''b''| &lt; 1.

:Consequently the [[implicit function theorem]] can be applied. It implies that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') is smooth near o. Its  Jacobian can be computed by implicit differentiation:

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|\partial_z H_f(0)|^2 -  |\partial_{\overline{z}}H_f(0)|^2 = {|\Phi_z(0,0)|^2 - |\Phi_{\overline{z}}(0,0)|^2 \over |\Phi_w(0,0)|^2 -|\Phi_{\overline{w}}(0,0)|^2} &gt;0.}&lt;/math&gt;

:Moreover

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{\partial_{\overline{z}}H_f (0)\over \partial_{z} H_f(0)}=g_b\left(-{a_{-1}\over \overline{a_{1}}}\right).}&lt;/math&gt;

*'''Homeomorphism on closed disk and diffeomorphism on open disk.''' It is enough to show that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is a homeomorphism. By continuity its image is compact so closed. The non-vanishing of the Jacobian, implies that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is an open mapping on the unit disk, so that the image of the open disk is open. Hence the image of the closed disk is an open and closed subset of the closed disk. By connectivity, it must be the whole disk. For |''w''| &lt; 1, the inverse image of ''w'' is closed, so compact, and entirely contained in the open disk. Since ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is locally a homeomorphism, it must be a finite set. The set of points ''w'' in the open disk with exactly ''n'' preimages is open. By connectivity every point has the same number ''N'' of preimages. Since the open disk is [[simply connected]], ''N'' = 1. (In fact taking any preimage of the origin, every radial line has a unique lifting to a preimage, and so there is an open subset of the unit disk mapping homeomorphically onto the open disc. If ''N'' &gt; 1, its complement would also have to be open, contradicting connectivity.)

==Extension of quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms==
In this section it is established that the extension of a [[quasisymmetric map|quasisymmetric]] homeomorphism is [[quasiconformal mapping|quasiconformal]]. Fundamental use is made of the notion of '''quasi-Möbius homeomorphism'''.

A homeomorphism ''f'' of the circle is [[quasisymmetric map|''quasisymmetric'']] if there are constants ''a'', ''b'' &gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{{|f(z_1)-f(z_2)|\over |f(z_1)-f(z_3)|} \le a {|z_1-z_2|^b\over |z_1-z_3|^b}.}&lt;/math&gt;

It is ''quasi-Möbius'' is there are constants ''c'', ''d'' &gt; 0 such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|(f(z_1),f(z_2);f(z_3),f(z_4))| \le c |(z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)|^d,}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ (z_1,z_2;z_3,z_4)={(z_1-z_3)(z_2-z_4)\over(z_2-z_3)(z_1-z_4)}}&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the [[cross-ratio]].

If ''f'' is quasisymmetric then it is also quasi-Möbius, with ''c'' = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''d'' = ''b'': this follows by multiplying the first inequality for (''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''z''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,''z''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). 

It is immediate that the quasi-Möbius homeomorphisms are closed under the operations of inversion and composition.

The [[Beltrami equation|complex dilatation]] μ of a diffeomorphism ''F'' of the unit disk is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu_F(z)={\partial_{\overline{z}}F(z)\over \partial_z F(z)}.}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''F'' and ''G'' are diffeomorphisms of the disk, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu_{G\circ F^{-1}}\circ F={F_z\over \overline{F_z}} {\mu_G-\mu_F\over 1 -\overline{\mu_F}\mu_G}.}&lt;/math&gt;

In particular if ''G'' is holomorphic, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu_{F\circ G^{-1}} \circ G = {G_z\over \overline{G_z}} \mu_F,\,\,\, \mu_{G^{-1}\circ F}=\mu_F.}&lt;/math&gt;

When ''F'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu_F(0)=g_b\left( -{a_{-1}\over \overline{a_{1}}}\right),}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{a_{\pm 1}={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta})e^{\mp i\theta} \, d\theta,\,\,\, b={1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} f(e^{i\theta})^2 \, d\theta.}&lt;/math&gt;

To prove that ''F'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is quasiconformal amounts to showing that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|\mu_F\|_\infty &lt; 1.}&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''f'' ia a quasi-Möbius homeomorphism the compositions ''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∘ ''f'' ∘ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; Möbius transformations satisfy exactly the same estimates, since Möbius transformations preserve the cross ratio. So to prove that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is quasiconformal it suffices to show that if ''f'' is any quasi-Möbius homeomorphism fixing 1, ''i'' and −''i'', with fixed ''c'' and ''d'', then the quantities

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\Lambda(f)=\left|g_b\left( -{a_{-1}\over \overline{a_{1}}}\right)\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

have an upper bound strictly less than one.

On the other hand if ''f'' is quasi-Möbius and fixes 1, ''i'' and −''i'', then ''f'' satisfies a [[Hölder continuity]] condition:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|f(z)-f(w)|\le C |z-w|^d,}&lt;/math&gt;

for another positive constant ''C'' independent of ''f''. The same is true for the ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;'s. But then the [[Arzelà–Ascoli theorem]] implies these homeomorphisms form a compact subset in C('''T'''). The non-linear functional Λ is continuous on this subset and therefore attains its upper bound at some ''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand Λ(''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; 1, so the upper bound is strictly less than 1.

The uniform Hölder estimate for ''f'' is established in {{harvtxt|Väisälä|1984}} as follows. Take ''z'', ''w'' in '''T'''.

*If |''z'' − 1| ≤ 1/4 and |''z'' - ''w''| ≤ 1/8, then |''z'' ± ''i''| ≥ 1/4 and |''w'' ± ''i''| ≥ 1/8. But then

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{|(w,i; z,-i)| \le 16|z-w|,\,\,\, |(f(w),i; f(z),-i)| \ge  |f(z)-f(w)|/8,}&lt;/math&gt;

:so there is a corresponding Hölder estimate.

*If |''z'' - ''w''| ≥ 1/8, the Hölder estimate is trivial since |''f''(''z'') - ''f''(''w'')| ≤ 2.
*If |''z'' - 1| ≥ 1/4, then |''w'' - ζ| ≥ 1/4 for ζ = ''i'' or −''i''. But then

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ |(z,\zeta;w,1)| \le 8|z-w|,\,\,\, |(f(z),\zeta; f(w),1)|\ge  |f(z)-f(w)|/8,}&lt;/math&gt;

:so there is a corresponding Hölder estimate.

'''Comment.''' In fact every quasi-Möbius homeomorphism ''f'' is also quasisymmetric. This follows using the Douady–Earle extension, since every quasiconformal homeomorphism of the unit disk induces a quasisymmetric homeomorphism of the unit circle. It can also be proved directly, following {{harvtxt|Väisälä|1984}}

:&lt;small&gt;Indeed it is immediate that if ''f'' is quasi-Möbius so is its inverse. It then follows that ''f''  (and hence ''f''&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;) is [[Hölder continuous]]. To see this Let ''S'' be the set of cube roots of unity, so that if ''a'' ≠ ''b'' in ''S'', then |''a'' − ''b''| = 2 sin {{pi}}/3 = {{radic|3}}. To prove a Hölder estimate, it can be assumed that ''x'' – ''y'' is uniformly small. Then both ''x'' and ''y'' are greater than a fixed distance away from ''a'', ''b'' in ''S'' with ''a'' ≠ ''b'', so the estimate follows by applying the quasi-Möbius inequality to ''x'', ''a'', ''y'', ''b''. To check that ''f'' is quasisymmetric, it suffices to find a uniform upper bound for |''f''(''x'') − ''f''(''y'')| / |''f''(''x'') − ''f''(''z'')| in the case of a triple with |''x'' − ''z''| = |''x'' − ''y''|, uniformly small. In this case there is a point ''w'' at a distance greater than 1 from ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''. Applying the quasi-Möbius inequality to ''x'', ''w'', ''y'' and ''z'' yields the required upper bound.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Encryption for the Masses''' ('''E4M''') is a [[free software|free]] [[disk encryption software]] for [[Windows NT]] and [[Windows 9x]] families of operating systems.  E4M is no longer maintained. Its author, [[Paul Le Roux]], joined Shaun Hollingworth (the author of the [[Scramdisk]]) to produce the commercial encryption product [[DriveCrypt]] for the security company SecurStar.

The popular [[Open-source software#Open-source vs. source-available|source-available]] [[freeware]] program [[TrueCrypt]] was based on E4M's source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/version-history2|title=Version History|publisher=TrueCrypt Foundation|accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, TrueCrypt uses a different container format than E4M, which makes it impossible to use one of these programs to access an encrypted volume created by the other.

Shortly after TrueCrypt version 1.0 was released in February 2004, the TrueCrypt Team reported receiving emails from Wilfried Hafner, manager of SecurStar, claiming that Paul Le Roux had stolen the source code of E4M from SecurStar as an employee. According to the TrueCrypt Team, the emails stated that Le Roux illegally distributed E4M, and authored an illegal license permitting anyone to base derivative work on E4M and distribute it freely, which Hefner alleges Le Roux did not have any right to do, claiming that all versions of E4M always belonged only to SecurStar. For a time, this led the TrueCrypt Team to stop developing and
distributing TrueCrypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title =P.

In [[mathematics]], an '''equalizer''' is a set of arguments where two or more [[function (mathematics)|function]]s have [[equality (math)|equal]] values.
An equalizer is the [[solution set]] of an [[equation]].
In certain contexts, a '''difference kernel''' is the equalizer of exactly two functions.

== Definitions ==

Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].
Let ''f'' and ''g'' be [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, both from ''X'' to ''Y''.
Then the ''equalizer'' of ''f'' and ''g'' is the set of elements ''x'' of ''X'' such that ''f''(''x'') equals ''g''(''x'') in ''Y''.
Symbolically:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Eq}(f,g) := \{x \in X \mid f(x) = g(x)\}\mbox{.}\! &lt;/math&gt;
The equalizer may be denoted Eq(''f'',''g'') or a variation on that theme (such as with lowercase letters "eq").
In informal contexts, the notation {''f'' = ''g''} is common.

The definition above used two functions ''f'' and ''g'', but there is no need to restrict to only two functions, or even to only [[finite set|finite]]ly many functions.
In general, if '''F''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of functions from ''X'' to ''Y'', then the ''equalizer'' of the members of '''F''' is the set of elements ''x'' of ''X'' such that, given any two members ''f'' and ''g'' of '''F''', ''f''(''x'') equals ''g''(''x'') in ''Y''.
Symbolically:
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{Eq}(\mathcal{F}) := \{x \in X \mid \forall{f,g \,}{\in}\, \mathcal{F}, \; f(x) = g(x)\}\mbox{.}\! &lt;/math&gt;
This equalizer may be written as Eq(''f'',''g'',''h'',...) if &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the set {''f'',''g'',''h'',...}.
In the latter case, one may also find {''f'' = ''g'' = ''h'' = ···} in informal contexts.

As a [[degenerate (math)|degenerate]] case of the general definition, let '''F''' be a [[singleton (set theory)|singleton]] {''f''}.
Since ''f''(''x'') always equals itself, the equalizer must be the entire domain ''X''.
As an even more degenerate case, let '''F''' be the [[empty set]] {}.
Then the equalizer is again the entire domain ''X'', since the [[universal quantification]] in the definition is [[vacuously true]].

== Difference kernels ==

A binary equalizer (that is, an equalizer of just two functions) is also called a ''difference kernel''.
This may also be denoted DiffKer(''f'',''g''), Ker(''f'',''g''), or Ker(''f'' &amp;minus; ''g'').
The last notation shows where this terminology comes from, and why it is most common in the context of [[abstract algebra]]:
The difference kernel of ''f'' and ''g'' is simply the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the difference ''f'' &amp;minus; ''g''.
Furthermore, the kernel of a single function ''f'' can be reconstructed as the difference kernel Eq(''f'',0), where 0 is the [[constant function]] with value [[0 (number)|zero]].

Of course, all of this presumes an algebraic context where the kernel of a function is its [[preimage]] under zero; that is not true in all situations.
However, the terminology "difference kernel" has no other meaning.

== In category theory ==

Equalizers can be defined by a [[universal property]], which allows the notion to be generalized from the [[category of sets]] to arbitrary [[category theory|categories]].

In the general context, ''X'' and ''Y'' are objects, while ''f'' and ''g'' are morphisms from ''X'' to ''Y''.
These objects and morphisms form a [[commutative diagram|diagram]] in the category in question, and the equalizer is simply the [[limit (category theory)|limit]] of that diagram.

In more explicit terms, the equalizer consists of an object ''E'' and a morphism ''eq'' : ''E'' → ''X'' satisfying &lt;math&gt;f \circ eq = g \circ eq&lt;/math&gt;,
and such that, given any object ''O'' and morphism ''m'' : ''O'' → ''X'', if &lt;math&gt;f \circ m = g \circ m&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] morphism ''u'' : ''O'' → ''E'' such that &lt;math&gt;eq \circ u = m&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;[[Image:Equalizer-01.svg|200px]]&lt;/div&gt;

A morphism &lt;math&gt;m:O \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; is said to '''equalize''' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f \circ m = g \circ m&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barr |first1=Michael |authorlink1=Michael Barr (mathematician) |last2=Wells |first2=Charles |authorlink2=Charles Wells (mathematician) |year=1998 |title=Category theory for computing science |page=266 |url=http://www.math.mcgill.ca/triples/Barr-Wells-ctcs.pdf |accessdate=2013-07-20 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any [[universal algebra]]ic category, including the categories where difference kernels are used, as well as the category of sets itself, the object ''E'' can always be taken to be the ordinary notion of equalizer, and the morphism ''eq'' can in that case be taken to be the [[inclusion function]] of ''E'' as a [[subset]] of ''X''.

The generalization of this to more than two morphisms is straightforward; simply use a larger diagram with more morphisms in it.
The degenerate case of only one morphism is also straightforward; then ''eq'' can be any [[isomorphism]] from an object ''E'' to ''X''.

The correct diagram for the degenerate case with ''no'' morphisms is slightly subtle: one might initially draw the diagram as consisting of the objects ''X'' and ''Y'' and no morphisms. This is incorrect, however, since the limit of such a diagram is the [[product (category theory)|product]] of ''X'' and ''Y'', rather than the equalizer. (And indeed products and equalizers are different concepts: the set-theoretic definition of product doesn't agree with the set-theoretic definition of the equalizer mentioned above, hence they are actually different.) Instead, the appropriate insight is that every equalizer diagram is fundamentally concerned with ''X'', including ''Y'' only because ''Y'' is the [[codomain]] of morphisms which appear in the diagram. With this view, we see that if there are no morphisms involved, ''Y'' does not make an appearance and the equalizer diagram consists of ''X'' alone. The limit of this diagram is then any isomorphism between ''E'' and ''X''.

It can be proved that any equalizer in any category is a [[monomorphism]].
If the [[converse (logic)|converse]] holds in a given category, then that category is said to be ''regular'' (in the sense of monomorphisms).
More generally, a [[regular monomorphism]] in any category is any morphism ''m'' that is an equalizer of some set of morphisms.
Some authorities require (more strictly) that ''m'' be a ''binary'' equalizer, that is an equalizer of exactly two morphisms.
However, if the category in question is [[complete category|complete]], then both definitions agree.

The notion of difference kernel also makes sense in a category-theoretic context.
The terminology "difference kernel" is common throughout category theory for any binary equalizer.
In the case of a [[preadditive category]] (a category [[enriched category|enriched]] over the category of [[Abelian group]]s), the term "difference kernel" may be interpreted literally, since subtraction of morphisms makes sense.
That is, Eq(''f'',''g'') = Ker(''f'' - ''g''), where Ker denotes the [[kernel (category theory)|category-theoretic kernel]].

Any category with fibre products (pullbacks) and products has equalizers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5497">In [[Riemannian geometry]], the '''filling radius''' of a [[Riemannian manifold]] ''X'' is a metric invariant of ''X''.  It was originally introduced in 1983 by [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]], who used it to prove his [[Gromov's systolic inequality for essential manifolds|systolic inequality for essential manifolds]], vastly generalizing [[Loewner's torus inequality]] and [[Pu's inequality|Pu's inequality for the real projective plane]], and creating [[systolic geometry]] in its modern form.

The filling radius of a simple loop ''C'' in the plane is defined as the largest radius, ''R''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, of a circle that fits inside&amp;nbsp;''C'':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FillRad}(C\subset \mathbb{R}^2) = R.&lt;/math&gt;

==Dual definition via neighborhoods==

There is a kind of a dual point of view that allows one to generalize this notion in an extremely fruitful way, as shown by Gromov.  Namely, we consider the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhoods of the loop ''C'', denoted

:&lt;math&gt;U_\varepsilon C \subset \mathbb{R}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; increases, the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U_\varepsilon C&lt;/math&gt; swallows up more and more of the interior of the loop.  The ''last'' point to be swallowed up is precisely the center of a largest inscribed circle. Therefore, we can  reformulate the above definition by defining 
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FillRad}(C\subset \mathbb{R}^2) &lt;/math&gt; to  be the infimum of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the loop ''C'' contracts to a point in &lt;math&gt;U_\varepsilon C&lt;/math&gt;.

Given a compact manifold ''X'' imbedded in, say, Euclidean space ''E'', we could define the filling radius ''relative'' to the imbedding, by minimizing the size of the neighborhood &lt;math&gt;U_\varepsilon X\subset E&lt;/math&gt; in which ''X'' could be homotoped to something smaller dimensional, e.g., to a lower-dimensional polyhedron. Technically it is more convenient to work with a homological definition.

==Homological definition==

Denote by ''A'' the coefficient ring &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt;, depending on whether or not ''X'' is orientable.  Then the [[fundamental class]],  denoted ''[X]'', of a compact ''n''-dimensional manifold ''X'', is a generator of the homology group &lt;math&gt;H_n(X;A)\simeq A&lt;/math&gt;, and we set 
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{FillRad}(X\subset E) = \inf \left\{ \varepsilon &gt; 0 \mid \iota_\varepsilon([X])=0\in H_n(U_\varepsilon X) \right\},
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\iota_\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the inclusion homomorphism.

To define an ''absolute'' filling radius in a situation where ''X'' is equipped with a Riemannian metric ''g'', Gromov proceeds as follows. One exploits an imbedding due to [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] (the first name is sometimes spelled with a "C").  One imbeds ''X'' in the Banach space &lt;math&gt;L^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt; of bounded Borel functions on ''X'', equipped with the sup norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;. Namely, we map a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; to the function &lt;math&gt;f_x\in L^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt; defined by the formula &lt;math&gt;f_x(y) = d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;y\in X&lt;/math&gt;, where ''d'' is the distance function defined by the metric. By the triangle inequality we have &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \| f_x - f_y \|,&lt;/math&gt; and therefore the imbedding is strongly isometric, in the precise sense that internal distance and ambient distance coincide.  Such a strongly isometric imbedding is impossible if the ambient space is a Hilbert space, even when ''X'' is the Riemannian circle (the distance between opposite points must be
{{pi}}, not 2!).  We then set &lt;math&gt;E= L^\infty(X)&lt;/math&gt; in the formula above, and define

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FillRad}(X)=\mathrm{FillRad} \left( X\subset
L^{\infty}(X) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties==

* The filling radius is at most a third of the diameter (Katz, 1983).
* The filling radius of [[real projective space]] with a metric of constant curvature is a third of its Riemannian diameter, see (Katz, 1983).  Equivalently, the filling radius is a sixth of the systole in these cases.  
* The filling radius of the Riemannian circle of length 2π, i.e. the unit circle with the induced Riemannian distance function, equals π/3, i.e. a sixth of its length. This follows by combining the diameter upper bound mentioned above with Gromov's lower bound in terms of the systole (Gromov, 1983)
*The systole of  an [[essential manifold]] ''M'' is at most six times its filling radius, see (Gromov, 1983).  
**The inequality is optimal in the sense that the boundary case of equality is attained by the real projective spaces as above.
* The [[injectivity radius]] of compact manifold gives a lower bound on filling radius. Namely,
*:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{FillRad} M\ge \frac{\mathrm{InjRad} M}{2(\dim M+2)}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20391">In the field of [[mathematics]] known as [[differential geometry]], a '''generalized complex structure''' is a property of a [[differential manifold]] that includes as special cases a [[linear complex structure|complex structure]] and a [[symplectic structure]].  Generalized complex structures were introduced by [[Nigel Hitchin]] in 2002 and further developed by his students [[Marco Gualtieri]] and [[Gil Cavalcanti]].

These structures first arose in Hitchin's program of characterizing geometrical structures via [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s of [[differential forms]], a connection which formed the basis of [[Robbert Dijkgraaf]], [[Sergei Gukov]], [[Andrew Neitzke]] and [[Cumrun Vafa]]'s 2004 proposal that [[topological string theory|topological string theories]] are special cases of a [[topological M-theory]].  Today generalized complex structures also play a leading role in physical [[string theory]], as [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[Compactification (physics)#Flux compactification|flux compactification]]s, which relate 10-dimensional physics to 4-dimensional worlds like ours, require (possibly twisted) generalized complex structures.

==Definition==

===The generalized tangent bundle===
Consider an ''N''-manifold ''M''. The [[tangent bundle]] of ''M'', which will be denoted '''T''', is the [[vector bundle]] over ''M'' whose fibers consist of all [[tangent vector]]s to ''M''.  A [[fiber bundle#Sections|section]] of '''T''' is a [[vector field]] on ''M''.  The [[cotangent bundle]] of ''M'', denoted '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, is the vector bundle over ''M'' whose sections are [[differential form|one-forms]] on ''M''.

In [[complex geometry]] one considers structures on the tangent bundles of manifolds.  In [[symplectic geometry]] one is instead interested in [[Exterior algebra#The exterior power|exterior powers]] of the cotangent bundle.  Generalized geometry unites these two fields by treating sections of the '''generalized tangent bundle''', which is the [[direct sum of vector bundles|direct sum]] '''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;
'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;  of the tangent and cotangent bundles, which are formal sums of a vector field and a one-form.

The fibers are endowed with a natural [[inner product]] with [[signature (topology)|signature]] (''N'',&amp;nbsp;''N'').  If ''X'' and ''Y'' are vector fields and ''ξ'' and ''η'' are one-forms then the inner product of ''X+ξ'' and ''Y+η'' is defined as

:::&lt;math&gt;\langle X+\xi,Y+\eta\rangle=\frac{1}{2}(\xi(Y)+\eta(X)).&lt;/math&gt;

A '''generalized almost complex structure''' is just an [[almost complex structure]] of the generalized tangent bundle which preserves the natural inner product:

:::&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal J}: \mathbf{T}\oplus\mathbf{T}^*\rightarrow \mathbf{T}\oplus\mathbf{T}^*&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:::&lt;math&gt;{\mathcal J}^2=-{\rm Id},\ \ \mbox{ and }\ \ \langle {\mathcal J}(X+\xi),{\mathcal J}(Y+\eta)\rangle=\langle X+\xi,Y+\eta\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

Like in the case of an ordinary [[almost complex structure]], a generalized almost complex structure is uniquely determined by its &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;-[[Vector bundle#Operations on vector bundles|eigenbundle]], i.e. a subbundle &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of the complexified generalized tangent bundle &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{T}\oplus\mathbf{T}^*)\otimes\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;
given by

:::&lt;math&gt;L=\{X+\xi\in (\mathbf{T}\oplus\mathbf{T}^*)\otimes\mathbb{C}\  :\  {\mathcal J}(X+\xi)=\sqrt{-1}(X+\xi)\}&lt;/math&gt;

Such subbundle ''L'' satisfies the following properties:

(i) the intersection with its [[complex conjugate]] is the zero section: &lt;math&gt;L\cap\overline{L}=0&lt;/math&gt;;

(ii) ''L'' is '''maximal isotropic''', i.e. its complex [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] equals  ''N'' and &lt;math&gt;\langle\ell,\ell'\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\ell,\ell'\in L.&lt;/math&gt;

Vice versa, any subbundle ''L'' satisfying (i), (ii) is the &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;-eigenbundle of a unique generalized almost complex structure, so that the properties (i), (ii) can be considered as an alternative definition of generalized almost complex structure.

===Courant bracket===
In ordinary complex geometry, an [[almost complex structure]] is [[Integrable system|integrable]] to a [[linear complex structure|complex structure]] if and only if the [[Lie derivative|Lie bracket]] of two sections of the [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] subbundle is another section of the holomorphic subbundle.

In generalized complex geometry one is not interested in vector fields, but rather in the formal sums of vector fields and one-forms.  A kind of Lie bracket for such formal sums was introduced in 1990 and is called the [[Courant bracket]] which is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;[X+\xi,Y+\eta]=[X,Y]
+\mathcal{L}_X\eta-\mathcal{L}_Y\xi
-\frac{1}{2}d(i(X)\eta-i(Y)\xi)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Lie derivative]] along the vector field ''X'', ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]] and ''i'' is the [[Exterior algebra#The interior product or insertion operator|interior product]].

===The definition===
A '''generalized complex structure''' is a generalized almost complex structure such that the space of smooth sections of ''L'' is closed under the Courant bracket.

==Maximal isotropic subbundles==

===Classification===
There is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal isotropic [[subbundle]] of '''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and pairs ('''E''',''ε'') where '''E''' is a subbundle of '''T''' and ''ε'' is a 2-form.  This correspondence extends straightforwardly to the complex case.

Given a pair ('''E''',''ε'') one can construct a maximally isotropic subbundle ''L''('''E''',''ε'') of '''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; as follows.  The elements of the subbundle are the [[formal sum]]s ''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ξ where the [[vector field]] ''X'' is a section of '''E''' and the one-form ''ξ'' restricted to the [[dual space]] '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to the one-form ε(''X'').

To see that ''L''('''E''',&amp;nbsp;''ε'') is isotropic, notice that if ''Y'' is a section of '''E''' and ''ξ'' restricted to '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is ''ε(X)'' then ξ(''Y'') = ε(''X'',&amp;nbsp;''Y''), as the part of ξ orthogonal to '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; annihilates ''Y''.  Thesefore if ''X''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ξ and ''Y''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;η are sections of  '''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;  then

:&lt;math&gt;\langle X+\xi,Y+\eta\rangle=\frac{1}{2}(\xi(Y)+\eta(X))=\frac{1}{2}(\epsilon(Y,X)+\epsilon(X,Y))=0&lt;/math&gt;

and so ''L''('''E''', ''ε'') is isotropic.  Furthermore, ''L''('''E''', ''ε'') is maximal because there are dim('''E''') (complex) dimensions of choices for '''E''', and ''ε'' is unrestricted on the [[complement (complexity)|complement]] of '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, which is of (complex) dimension ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;dim('''E''').  Thus the total (complex) dimension in ''n''.  Gualtieri has proven that all maximal isotropic subbundles are of the form ''L''('''E''',ε) for some '''E''' and ε.

===Type===
The '''type''' of a maximal isotropic subbundle ''L''('''E''',ε) is the real dimension of the subbundle that annihilates '''E'''.  Equivalently it is ''2N'' minus the real dimension of the [[projection (mathematics)|projection]] of ''L''('''E''',ε) onto the tangent bundle '''T'''.  In other words, the type of a maximal isotropic subbundle is the codimension of its projection onto the tangent bundle.  In the complex case one uses the complex dimension and the type is sometimes referred to as the '''complex type'''.  While the type of a subbundle can in principle be any integer between 0 and ''2N'', generalized almost complex structures cannot have a type greater than ''N'' because the sum of the subbundle and its complex conjugate must be all of ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;
'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''.

The type of a maximal isotropic subbundle is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under [[diffeomorphisms]] and also under shifts of the [[Kalb-Ramond field|B-field]], which are [[isometry|isometries]] of '''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of the form
:::&lt;math&gt;X+\xi\longrightarrow X+\xi+i_XB&lt;/math&gt;
where ''B'' is an arbitrary closed 2-form called the B-field in the [[string theory]] literature.

The type of a generalized almost complex structure is in general not constant, it can jump by any even [[integer]].  However it is upper [[semi-continuous]], which means that each point has an open neighborhood in which the type does not increase.  In practice this means that subsets of greater type than the ambient type occur on submanifolds with positive [[codimension]].

===Real index===
The real index ''r'' of a maximal isotropic subspace ''L'' is the complex dimension of the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of ''L'' with its complex conjugate.  A maximal isotropic subspace of  ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''C''' is a generalized almost complex structure if and only if ''r'' = 0.

==Canonical bundle==
As in the case of ordinary complex geometry, there is a correspondence between generalized almost complex structures and [[complex line bundle]]s.  The complex line bundle corresponding to a particular generalized almost complex structure is often referred to as the '''canonical bundle''', as it generalizes the [[canonical bundle]] in the ordinary case.  It is sometimes also called the [[pure spinor bundle]], as its sections are [[pure spinor]]s.

===Generalized almost complex structures===

The canonical bundle is a one complex dimensional subbundle of the bundle '''Λ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;T'''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C''' of complex differential forms on ''M''.  Recall that the [[gamma matrices]] define an [[isomorphism]] between differential forms and spinors.  In particular even and odd forms map to the two chiralities of [[Spinor#Weyl spinors|Weyl spinors]].  Vectors have an action on differential forms given by the interior product.  One-forms have an action on forms given by the wedge product.  Thus sections of the bundle ('''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''C'''   act on differential forms.  This action is a [[group representation|representation]] of the action of the [[Clifford algebra]] on spinors.

A spinor is said to be a '''pure spinor''' if it is annihilated by half of a set of a set of generators of the Clifford algebra.   Spinors are sections of our bundle '''Λ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;T''', and generators of the Clifford algebra are the fibers of our other bundle ('''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''C'''.
Therefore, a given pure spinor is annihilated by a half-dimensional subbundle '''E''' of ('''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''C'''.
Such subbundles are always isotropic, so to define an almost complex structure one must only impose that the sum of '''E''' and its complex conjugate is all of ('''T'''&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''C'''.  This is true whenever the [[wedge product]] of the pure spinor and its complex conjugate contains a top-dimensional component.  Such pure spinors determine generalized almost complex structures.

Given a generalized almost complex structure, one can also determine a pure spinor up to multiplication by an arbitrary [[complex function]].  These choices of pure spinors are defined to be the sections of the canonical bundle.

===Integrability and other structures===

If a pure spinor that determines a particular complex structure is [[Closed and exact differential forms|closed]], or more generally if its exterior derivative is equal to the action of a gamma matrix on itself, then the almost complex structure is integrable and so such pure spinors correspond to generalized complex structures.

If one further imposes that the canonical bundle is holomorphically trivial, meaning that it is global sections which are closed forms, then it defines a generalized Calabi-Yau structure and ''M'' is said to be a '''generalized Calabi-Yau manifold'''.

==Local classification==

===Canonical bundle===
Locally all pure spinors can be written in the same form, depending on an integer ''k'', the B-field 2-form ''B'', a nondegenerate symplectic form ω and a ''k''-form Ω. In a local neighborhood of any point a [[pure spinor]] Φ which generates the canonical bundle may always be put in the form
::::&lt;math&gt;\Phi=e^{B+i\omega}\Omega&lt;/math&gt;
where Ω is decomposable as the [[wedge product]] of one-forms.

===Regular point===
Define the subbundle '''E''' of the complexified tangent bundle '''T'''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C''' to be the projection of the holomorphic subbundle '''L''' of ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)
&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C''' to '''T'''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''.  In the definition of a generalized almost complex structure we have imposed that the intersection of '''L''' and its conjugate contains only the origin, otherwise they would be unable to span the entirety of ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)
&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''.  However the intersection of their projections need not be trivial.  In general this intersection is of the form
::::&lt;math&gt;E\cap\overline{E}=\Delta\otimes\mathbf{C}&lt;/math&gt;
for some subbundle Δ.  A point which has an [[open set|open]] [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] in which the dimension of the fibers of Δ is constant is said to be a '''regular point'''.

===Darboux's theorem===
{{main|Darboux's theorem}}
Every regular point in a generalized complex manifold has an open neighborhood which, after a diffeomorphism and shift of the B-field, has the same generalized complex structure as the [[Cartesian product]] of the [[Linear complex structure|complex vector space]] '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; and the standard symplectic space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2n-2k&lt;/sup&gt; with the standard symplectic form, which is the [[direct sum of matrices|direct sum]] of the two by two off-diagonal matrices with entries 1 and -1.

===Local holomorphicity===

Near non-regular points, the above classification theorem does not apply.  However, about any point, a generalized complex manifold is, up to diffeomorphism and B-field, a product of a symplectic manifold with a generalized complex manifold which is of complex type at the point, much like Weinstein's theorem for the local structure of [[Poisson manifold]]s.  The remaining question of the local structure is: what does a generalized complex structure look like near a point of complex type?  In fact, it will be induced by a holomorphic [[Poisson manifold|Poisson structure]].

==Examples==

===Complex manifolds===

The space of complex differential forms '''Λ&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;T'''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C''' has a complex conjugation operation given by complex conjugation in '''C'''.  This allows one to define [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] and [[antiholomorphic]] one-forms and (''m, n'')-forms, which are homogeneous polynomials in these one-forms with ''m'' holomorphic factors and ''n'' antiholomorphic factors.  In particular, all (''n,0'')-forms are related locally by multiplication by a complex function and so they form a complex line bundle.

(''n,0'')-forms are pure spinors, as they are annihilated by antiholomorphic tangent vectors and by holomorphic one-forms.  Thus this line bundle can be used as a canonical bundle to define a generalized complex structure.  Restricting the annihilator from ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;
'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C''' to the complexified tangent bundle one gets the subspace of antiholomorphic vector fields.  Therefore, this generalized complex structure on  ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;
'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''  defines an ordinary [[linear complex structure|complex structure]] on the tangent bundle.

As only half of a basis of vector fields are holomorphic, these complex structures are of type ''N''.  In fact complex manifolds, and the manifolds obtained by multiplying the pure spinor bundle defining a complex manifold by a complex, &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;-closed (2,0)-form, are the only type ''N'' generalized complex manifolds.

===Symplectic manifolds===

The pure spinor bundle generated by
:::&lt;math&gt;\phi=e^{i\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

for a nondegenerate two-form ''ω'' defines a symplectic structure on the tangent space.  Thus symplectic manifolds are also generalized complex manifolds.

The above pure spinor is globally defined, and so the canonical bundle is trivial.  This means that symplectic manifolds are not only generalized complex manifolds but in fact are generalized Calabi-Yau manifolds.

The pure spinor &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is related to a pure spinor which is just a number by an imaginary shift of the B-field, which is a shift of the [[Kähler form]].  Therefore, these generalized complex structures are of the same type as those corresponding to a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] pure spinor.  A scalar is annihilated by the entire tangent space, and so these structures are of type ''0''.

Up to a shift of the B-field, which corresponds to multiplying the pure spinor by the exponential of a closed, real 2-form, symplectic manifolds are the only type 0 generalized complex manifolds.  Manifolds which are symplectic up to a shift of the B-field are sometimes called '''B-symplectic'''.

==Relation to G-structures==
Some of the almost structures in generalized complex geometry may be rephrased in the language of [[G-structure]]s.  The word "almost" is removed if the structure is integrable.

The bundle ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;'''C''' with the above inner product is an O(2''n'',&amp;nbsp;2''n'') structure.  A generalized almost complex structure is a reduction of this structure to a U(''n'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') structure.  Therefore, the space of generalized complex structures is the coset

:::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{O(2n,2n)}{U(n,n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

A [[generalized Kähler structure|generalized almost Kähler structure]] is a pair of [[commutative operation|commuting]] generalized complex structures such that minus the product of the corresponding tensors is a positive definite metric on ('''T'''&lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt;
'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''.
Generalized Kähler structures are reductions of the structure group to U(''n'')&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;U(''n'').  Generalized Kähler manifolds, and their twisted counterparts, are equivalent to the [[bihermitian manifolds]] discovered by [[Sylvester James Gates]], [[Chris Hull (physicist)|Chris Hull]] and [[Martin Rocek|Martin Roček]] in the context of 2-dimensional [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] in 1984.

Finally, a generalized almost Calabi-Yau metric structure is a further reduction of the structure group to SU(''n'')&lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;SU(''n'').

===Calabi versus Calabi&amp;ndash;Yau metric===

Notice that a generalized Calabi metric structure, which was introduced by Marco Gualtieri, is a stronger condition than a generalized Calabi&amp;ndash;Yau structure, which was introduced by [[Nigel Hitchin]].  In particular a generalized Calabi&amp;ndash;Yau metric structure implies the existence of two commuting generalized almost complex structures.

In [[information theory]], '''Gibbs' inequality''' is a statement about the [[entropy (information theory)|mathematical entropy]] of a discrete [[probability distribution]]. Several other bounds on the entropy of probability distributions are derived from Gibbs' inequality, including [[Fano's inequality]].
It was first presented by [[J. Willard Gibbs]] in the 19th century.

==Gibbs' inequality==
Suppose that

:&lt;math&gt; P = \{ p_1 , \ldots , p_n \} &lt;/math&gt;

is a [[probability distribution]]. Then for any other probability distribution

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \{ q_1 , \ldots , q_n \} &lt;/math&gt;

the following inequality between positive quantities (since the p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are positive numbers less than one) holds&lt;ref name="Bremaud2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Bremaud|title=An Introduction to Probabilistic Modeling|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4612-1046-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|68}}

:&lt;math&gt; - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 p_i \leq - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 q_i &lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if

:&lt;math&gt; p_i = q_i &lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i''. Put in words, the [[information entropy]] of a distribution P is less than or equal to its [[cross entropy]] with any other distribution Q.

The difference between the two quantities is the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] or relative entropy, so the inequality can also be written:&lt;ref name="MacKay2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. C. MacKay|title=Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

:&lt;math&gt; D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P\|Q) \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log_2 \frac{p_i}{q_i} \geq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the use of base-2 [[logarithm]]s is optional, and 
allows one to refer to the quantity on each side of the inequality as an 
"average [[surprisal]]" measured in [[bit]]s.

==Proof==
For simplicity we prove the statement using the natural logarithm (ln), since

:&lt;math&gt; \log_2 a = \frac{ \ln a }{ \ln 2 },&lt;/math&gt;

the particular logarithm we choose only scales the relationship.

Let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; for which ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is non-zero. Then, since &lt;math&gt; \ln x \leq x-1 &lt;/math&gt; for all ''x &gt; 0'', with equality if and only if ''x=1'', we have:

:&lt;math&gt;- \sum_{i \in I} p_i \ln \frac{q_i}{p_i}  \geq  - \sum_{i \in I} p_i \left( \frac{q_i}{p_i} - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;=  - \sum_{i \in I} q_i + \sum_{i \in I} p_i  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;= 0&lt;/math&gt;
:Then,
:&lt;math&gt; - \sum_{i \in I} p_i \ln \frac{q_i}{p_i} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The last inequality is a consequence of the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' being part of a probability distribution.  Therefore, the sum of all values is unity.  Specifically, the sum of all non-zero values is also unity, however, some non-zero ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be excluded since the choice of indices is conditioned upon the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. Therefore the sum of the ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' may be less than unity.

We now have:

:&lt;math&gt; - \sum_{i \in I} p_i \ln \frac{q_i}{p_i} \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; - \sum_{i \in I} p_i \ln q_i + \sum_{i \in I} p_i \ln p_i \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Since the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are probabilities, their logarithms are negative.  The negation of the first sum is thus positive, and the un-negated second sum is negative.  We may therefore add the negation of the second sum to both sides (a positive number) without changing the inequality to get:
 
:&lt;math&gt; - \sum_{i \in I} p_i \ln q_i \geq - \sum_{i \in I} p_i \ln p_i &lt;/math&gt;

Since the logarithm of zero is negative infinity, restoring the indices for values of ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' that are zero requires some care. We notice that:

:&lt;math&gt;0\cdot \textrm{ln}\, 0 = 0 \cdot -\infty = -\frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;

The quotient of zeros is an [[indeterminate form]].  Typically it is defined to be the convergent of asymptotic values in its neigborhood, or, if such a convergent does not exist, a convention convenient to the case at hand is adopted. In this context, the usual convention is to take the indeterminate form to be identically zero.  This gives us:

:&lt;math&gt; - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \ln q_i \geq - \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \ln p_i &lt;/math&gt;

The right hand side does not grow by our convention, and the left hand side does not grow either because zero times anything is zero, or by convention when ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is also zero.

For equality to hold, we require:
# &lt;math&gt; \frac{q_i}{p_i} = 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i \in I &lt;/math&gt; so that the approximation &lt;math&gt;\ln \frac{q_i}{p_i} = \frac{q_i}{p_i} -1 &lt;/math&gt; is exact.
# &lt;math&gt; \sum_{i \in I} q_i = 1&lt;/math&gt; so that equality continues to hold between the third and fourth lines of the proof.

This can happen if and only if

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = q_i &lt;/math&gt;

for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''.

==Alternative proofs==
The result can alternatively be proved using [[Jensen's inequality]] or [[log sum inequality]]. Below we give a proof based on Jensen's inequality:

Because log is a concave function, we have that:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_i p_i \log\frac{q_i}{p_i} \le \log\sum_i p_i\frac{q_i}{p_i} = \log\sum_i q_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where the first inequality is due to Jensen's inequality, and the last equality is because &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is a probability distribution.

Further, because &lt;math&gt;\log&lt;/math&gt; is not linear, therefore by the equality condition of Jensen's inequality, we get equality when

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{q_1}{p_1} = \frac{q_2}{p_2} = \cdots = \frac{q_n}{p_n}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose that this ratio is &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, then we have that

:&lt;math&gt;1 = \sum_i q_i = \sum_i \sigma p_i = \sigma&lt;/math&gt;

Where we use the fact that &lt;math&gt;p, q&lt;/math&gt; are probability distributions. Therefore the equality happens when &lt;math&gt;p = q&lt;/math&gt;.

==Corollary==
The [[information entropy|entropy]] of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by:&lt;ref name="Bremaud2012"/&gt;{{rp|68}}

:&lt;math&gt;H(p_1, \ldots , p_n) \leq \log n. &lt;/math&gt;

The proof is trivial – simply set &lt;math&gt;q_i = 1/n &lt;/math&gt; for all ''i''.

'''Golden Star''' is a technical signal used in technical analysis of stock prices charts that first was introduced in 2007 by J. Stromberg at the website getagraph.com. The signal derives from the well known [[Moving average crossover|Golden Cross]] that uses the 200 days moving average and the 50 days moving averages to define what has been argued by many to be the best technical signal of them all. Some, however, disagree, and as late as in April 2016 Kate Rooney publish the article "Don't trust the Dow's 'golden cross': Belski", at CNN (Kate Rooney, 2016) where Belski states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rooney|first1=Kate|title=Don't trust the Dow's 'golden cross': Belski|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/20/dont-trust-the-dows-golden-cross-belski.html|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Star signal differs from the Golden Cross by adding more conditions. The moving averages has to be selected based on the time frame selected. In addition, it has to cross the price line at a given pattern as shown below.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7039">In [[mathematics]], the [[infinite series]] &lt;math&gt;1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + \dotsb&lt;/math&gt;, also written
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_{n=0}^{\infin} (-1)^n
&lt;/math&gt;
is sometimes called '''Grandi's series''', after Italian mathematician, philosopher, and priest [[Guido Grandi]], who gave a memorable treatment of the series in 1703. It is a [[divergent series]], meaning that it lacks a sum in the usual sense. On the other hand, its [[Cesàro summation|Cesàro sum]] is 1/2.

==Unrigorous methods==
One obvious method to attack the series
:1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ...
is to treat it like a [[telescoping series]] and perform the subtractions in place:

:(1 − 1) + (1 − 1) + (1 − 1) + ... = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 0.

On the other hand, a similar bracketing procedure leads to the apparently contradictory result
:1 + (−1 + 1) + (−1 + 1) + (−1 + 1) + ... = 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + ... = 1.

Thus, by applying parentheses to Grandi's series in different ways, one can obtain either 0 or 1 as a "value". (Variations of this idea, called the [[Eilenberg–Mazur swindle]], are sometimes used in [[knot theory]] and [[algebra]].)

Treating Grandi's series as a [[divergent geometric series]] and using the same algebraic methods that evaluate convergent geometric series to obtain a third value:
:''S'' = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ..., so
:1 − ''S'' = 1 − (1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ...) = 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... = ''S''
:1 − ''S'' = ''S''
:1 = 2''S'',
resulting in ''S'' = 1/2.
The same conclusion results from calculating −''S'', subtracting the result from ''S'', and solving 2''S'' = 1.&lt;ref name=Devlin77&gt;Devlin p.77&lt;/ref&gt;

The above manipulations do not consider what the sum of a series actually means and how said algebraic methods can be applied to [[divergent geometric series]]. Still, to the extent that it is important to be able to bracket series at will, and that it is more important to be able to perform arithmetic with them, one can arrive at two conclusions:
*The series 1 − 1 + 1 − 1 + ... has no sum.&lt;ref name=Devlin77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Davis152&gt;Davis p.152&lt;/ref&gt;
*...but its sum ''should'' be 1/2.&lt;ref name=Davis152 /&gt;
In fact, both of these statements can be made precise and formally proven, but only using well-defined mathematical concepts that arose in the 19th century. After the late 17th-century [[history of calculus|introduction of calculus in Europe]], but before the advent of modern [[rigor#Mathematical_rigour|rigor]], the tension between these answers fueled what has been characterized as an "endless" and "violent" dispute between [[mathematician]]s.&lt;ref name=Kline307&gt;Kline 1983 p.307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Knopp457&gt;Knopp p.457&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for the [[Geometric progression#Infinite geometric series|sum to infinity of a Geometric series]] is &lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{1-r} &lt;/math&gt;, although the derivation for the sum is only valid when &lt;math&gt; |r|&lt;1 &lt;/math&gt; (as with the modulus of r less than one then the terms of the series will decay to zero as n increases and the series will converge).
In the case of &lt;math&gt; G= 1 - 1 + 1 - 1+\cdots &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; a=1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;  r=-1  &lt;/math&gt;, the above formula would equate to &lt;math&gt; \frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-(-1)} = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; but since the series does not converge it is misleading to speak of its "sum".

==Early ideas==
{{main|History of Grandi's series}}

==Divergence==
In modern mathematics, the sum of an infinite series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its [[partial sum]]s, if it exists. The sequence of partial sums of Grandi's series is {{nowrap|1, 0, 1, 0, ...,}} which clearly does not approach any number (although it does have two [[accumulation point]]s at 0 and 1). Therefore, Grandi's series is [[Divergent series|divergent]].

It can be shown that it is not valid to perform many seemingly innocuous operations on a series, such as reordering individual terms, unless the series is [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]]. Otherwise these operations can alter the result of summation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=A First Course in Real Analysis|series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]|first1=Murray H.|last1=Protter|first2=Charles B., Jr.|last2=Morrey|publisher=Springer|year=1991|isbn=9780387974378|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pZJeQ2lEmkC&amp;pg=PA249}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the terms of Grandi's series can be rearranged to have its accumulation points at any interval of two or more consecutive integer numbers, not only 0 or 1. For instance, the series
:&lt;math&gt;1+1+1+1+1-1-1+1+1-1-1+1+1-1-1+1+1-\cdots&lt;/math&gt;
(in which, after five initial +1 terms, the terms alternate in pairs of +1 and −1 terms) is a [[permutation]] of Grandi's series in which each value in the rearranged series corresponds to a value that is at most four positions away from it in the original series; its accumulation points are 3, 4, and 5.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2475">In [[numerical analysis]], an '''incomplete Cholesky factorization''' of a symmetric [[positive definite matrix]] is a [[sparse matrix|sparse]] approximation of the [[Cholesky factorization]]. An incomplete Cholesky factorization is often used as a [[preconditioner]] for algorithms like the [[conjugate gradient method]].

The Cholesky factorization of a positive definite matrix ''A'' is ''A'' = ''LL''* where ''L'' is a [[lower triangular matrix]]. An incomplete Cholesky factorization is given by a sparse lower triangular matrix ''K'' that is in some sense close to ''L''. The corresponding preconditioner is ''KK''*. 

One popular way to find such a matrix ''K'' is to use the algorithm for finding the exact Cholesky decomposition, except that any entry is set to zero if the corresponding entry in ''A'' is also zero. This gives an incomplete Cholesky factorization which is as sparse as the matrix ''A''.

== Algorithm ==
For &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
L_{ii}  = \left( {a_{ii}  - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{i - 1} {L_{ik}^2 } } \right)^{{1 \over 2}} 
&lt;/math&gt;
:For &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;i+1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;
L_{ji}  = {1 \over {L_{ii} }}\left( {a_{ji}  - \sum\limits_{k = 1}^{i - 1} {L_{ik} L_{jk} } } \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

== Implementation ==

Implementation of the incomplete Cholesky factorization in the Octave scripting language. The factorization is stored as a lower triangular matrix, with the elements in the upper triangle set to zero.

&lt;source lang="octave"&gt;
function a = ichol(a)
	n = size(a,1);

	for k=1:n
		a(k,k) = sqrt(a(k,k));
		for i=(k+1):n
		    if (a(i,k)!=0)
		        a(i,k) = a(i,k)/a(k,k);            
		    endif
		endfor
		for j=(k+1):n
		    for i=j:n
		        if (a(i,j)!=0)
		            a(i,j) = a(i,j)-a(i,k)*a(j,k);  
		        endif
		    endfor
		endfor
	endfor

    for i=1:n
        for j=i+1:n
            a(i,j) = 0;
        endfor
    endfor            
endfunction
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4094">In [[mathematical logic]], '''independence''' refers to the unprovability of a [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] from other sentences.
 
A [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] σ is '''independent''' of a given [[theory (mathematical logic)|first-order theory]] ''T'' if ''T'' neither proves nor refutes σ; that is, it is impossible to prove σ from ''T'', and it is also impossible to prove from ''T'' that σ is false. Sometimes, σ is said (synonymously) to be '''undecidable''' from ''T''; this is not the same meaning of "[[Undecidable problem|decidability]]" as in a [[decision problem]].

A theory ''T'' is '''independent''' if each axiom in ''T'' is not provable from the remaining axioms in ''T''. A theory for which there is an independent set of axioms is '''independently axiomatizable'''.

==Usage note==
Some authors say that σ is independent of ''T'' when ''T'' simply cannot prove σ, and do not necessarily assert by this that ''T'' cannot refute σ. These authors will sometimes say "&amp;sigma; is independent of and consistent with ''T''" to indicate that ''T'' can neither prove nor refute σ.

==Independence results in set theory==

Many interesting statements in set theory are independent of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF). The following statements in set theory are known to be independent of ZF, under the assumption that ZF is consistent:
*The [[axiom of choice]]
*The [[continuum hypothesis]] and the [[Continuum hypothesis#The generalized continuum hypothesis|generalized continuum hypothesis]]
*The [[Suslin's problem|Suslin conjecture]]

The following statements (none of which have been proved false) cannot be proved in ZFC (the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice) to be independent of ZFC, under the added hypothesis that ZFC is consistent. 

*The existence of [[strongly inaccessible cardinal]]s
*The existence of [[large cardinal]]s
*The non-existence of [[Kurepa tree]]s

The following statements are inconsistent with the axiom of choice, and therefore with ZFC. However they are probably independent of ZF, in a corresponding sense to the above: They cannot be proved in ZF, and few working set theorists expect to find a refutation in ZF. However ZF cannot prove that they are independent of ZF, even with the added hypothesis that ZF is consistent.

*The [[axiom of determinacy]]
*The [[axiom of real determinacy]]
*[[AD+]]

== Applications to physical theory ==
Since 2000, logical independence has become understood as having crucial significance in the foundations of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Paterek |first1=T. |last2=Kofler |first2=J. |last3=Prevedel |first3=R. |last4=Klimek |first4=P. |last5=Aspelmeyer |first5=M. |last6=Zeilinger |first6=A. |last7=Brukner |first7=Č. |year=2010 |title=Logical independence and quantum randomness |journal=[[New Journal of Physics]] |volume=12 |issue= |pages=013019 |arxiv=0811.4542 |bibcode=2010NJPh...12a3019P |doi=10.1088/1367-2630/12/1/013019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Székely |first=Gergely |year=2013 |title=The Existence of Superluminal Particles is Consistent with the Kinematics of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Reports on Mathematical Physics]] |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=133–152 |arxiv=1202.5790 |bibcode=2013RpMP...72..133S |doi=10.1016/S0034-4877(13)00021-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James "Jim" Paul Keener''' is an American mathematician, currently Distinguished Professor at [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.math.utah.edu/~keener/ |title=Jim Keener |publisher=utah.edu |accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n86057843/ |title=Keener, James P. |publisher=worldcat.org |accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://academic-affairs.utah.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/03/Distinguished-Professors-List-2016-5.pdf |title=Distinguished Professors List |publisher=utah.edu |accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is recognized as a pioneer in the field of mathematical physiology and cardiology.

==Biography==
Jim Keener received his PhD from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1972. Initially intending to work on [[bifurcation theory]], he came across a paper by [[Otto Rossler]] that implied that heartbeat can be modeled using [[chaos theory]]. Looking to investigate this claim, he picked up the ''Textbook of Medical Physiology'' by [[Arthur Guyton]] to build some foundational knowledge in cardiology and discovered examples of [[dynamical systems]] that had previously been untouched by the applied mathematics community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keener|first1=Jim|title=My Career in Mathematical Biology: A Personal Journel|journal=Newsletter for the Society for Mathematical Biology|date=September 2008|volume=21|issue=3|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited to join the faculty at the [[University of Utah]] in 1978 by Frank Hoppensteadt to start a new group in [[mathematical biology]]. He served as [[editor-in-chief]] of the [[SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics]] and was named a [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics#SIAM Fellows| SIAM Fellow]] in 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6939">'''János Komlós''' ([[Budapest]], 23 May 1942) is a [[Hungarian American|Hungarian-American]] [[mathematician]], working in [[probability theory]] and [[discrete mathematics]]. He has been a professor of [[mathematics]] at [[Rutgers University]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.rutgers.edu/people/?type=faculty&amp;id=199 Rutgers faculty profile for Komlós].&lt;/ref&gt; since 1988. He graduated from the [[Eötvös Loránd University]], then became a fellow at the [[Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics|Mathematical Institute]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. Between 1984&amp;ndash;1988 he worked at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucsd.edu/about/history/ UCSD Maths Dept history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028083525/http://math.ucsd.edu/about/history/ |date=2008-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable results==
* He proved that every [[L1 norm|L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]]-bounded sequence of real functions contains a subsequence such that the [[arithmetic mean]]s of all its subsequences [[Almost everywhere convergence|converge pointwise almost everywhere]]. In probabilistic terminology, the theorem is as follows. Let ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... be a sequence of [[random variable]]s such that ''E''[ξ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;],''E''[ξ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;],... is bounded. Then there exist a subsequence ξ'&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ξ'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... and a random variable β such that for each further subsequence η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,η&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,... of ξ'&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ξ'&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...  we have (η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+...+η&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;)/n → β [[almost surely|a.s]].
* With [[Miklós Ajtai]] and [[Endre Szemerédi]] he proved&lt;ref&gt;M. Ajtai, J. Komlós, E. Szemerédi: A note on Ramsey numbers, ''J. Combin. Theory Ser. A'',  '''29'''(1980), 354&amp;ndash;360.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''ct''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/log ''t'' upper bound for the [[Ramsey's theorem#Ramsey numbers|Ramsey number]] ''R''(3,''t''). The corresponding lower bound was established by [[Jeong Han Kim]] only in 1995, and this result earned him a [[Fulkerson Prize]].

* The same team of authors  developed the optimal Ajtai–Komlós–Szemerédi [[sorting network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Miklós|last1=Ajtai|author1-link=Miklós Ajtai|first2=János|last2=Komlós|first3=Endre|last3=Szemerédi|author3-link=Endre Szemerédi|contribution=An O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') sorting network|title=[[Symposium on Theory of Computing|Proc. 15th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing]]|year=1983|pages=1–9|doi=10.1145/800061.808726}}; {{citation|first1=Miklós|last1=Ajtai|author1-link=Miklós Ajtai|first2=János|last2=Komlós|first3=Endre|last3=Szemerédi|author3-link=Endre Szemerédi|title=Sorting in ''c''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'' parallel steps|journal=Combinatorica|volume=3|issue=1|year=1983|pages=1–19|doi=10.1007/BF02579338}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Komlós and Szemerédi proved that if ''G'' is a [[random graph]] on ''n'' vertices  with
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac12n\log n+\frac12n\log\log n+cn&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
:edges, where ''c'' is a fixed real number, then the probability that ''G'' has a [[Hamiltonian circuit]] converges to
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;e^{-e^{-2c}}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
* With [[Gábor N. Sárközy|Gábor Sárközy]] and [[Endre Szemerédi]] he proved the so-called [[blow-up lemma]] which claims that the regular pairs in [[Szemerédi's regularity lemma]] are similar to [[complete bipartite graph]]s when considering the embedding of graphs with bounded degrees.&lt;ref&gt;J. Komlós, G. Sárközy, Szemerédi: Blow-Up Lemma,  ''[[Combinatorica]]'', '''17'''(1997), 109&amp;ndash;123.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Komlós worked on [[Heilbronn triangle problem|Heilbronn's problem]]; he,  [[János Pintz]] and Szemerédi disproved Heilbronn's conjecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Komlós|first1=J.|author2-link=János Pintz|last2=Pintz|first2=J.|last3=Szemerédi|first3=E.|author3-link=Endre Szemerédi|title=A lower bound for Heilbronn's problem|journal=[[Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]|volume=25|issue=1|pages=13–24|year=1982|doi=10.1112/jlms/s2-25.1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7139">In mathematics  a '''linear inequality''' is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] which involves a [[linear function]]. A linear inequality contains one of the symbols of inequality:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|Heeren|1986|loc=p. 355}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It shows the data which is not equal in graph form.
* &lt; is less than

* &gt; is greater than
* ≤ is less than or equal to
* ≥ is greater than or equal to
* ≠ is not equal to
* = is equal to 
A linear inequality looks exactly like a [[linear equation]], with the inequality sign replacing the equality sign.

==Linear inequalities of real numbers==

===Two-dimensional linear inequalities===
[[File:Linearineq1.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Graph of linear inequality:&lt;br&gt; x + 3y &lt; 9&lt;/center&gt;]]

Two-dimensional linear inequalities are expressions in two variables of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;ax + by &lt; c \text{ and } ax + by \geq c,&lt;/math&gt;
where the inequalities may either be strict or not. The solution set of such an inequality can be graphically represented by a half-plane (all the points on one "side" of a fixed line) in the Euclidean plane.&lt;ref&gt;Technically, for this statement to be correct both ''a'' and ''b'' can not simultaneously be zero. In that situation, the solution set is either empty or the entire plane.&lt;/ref&gt; The line that determines the half-planes (''ax'' + ''by'' = ''c'') is not included in the solution set when the inequality is strict. A simple procedure to determine which half-plane is in the solution set is to calculate the value of ''ax'' + ''by'' at a point (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) which is not on the line and observe whether or not the inequality is satisfied.

For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angel|Porter|1989|loc=p. 310}}&lt;/ref&gt; to draw the solution set of ''x'' + 3''y'' &lt; 9, one first draws the line with equation ''x'' + 3''y'' = 9 as a dotted line, to indicate that the line is not included in the solution set since the inequality is strict. Then, pick a convenient point not on the line, such as (0,0). Since 0 + 3(0) = 0 &lt; 9, this point is in the solution set, so the half-plane containing this point (the half-plane "below" the line) is the solution set of this linear inequality.

===Linear inequalities in general dimensions===
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; linear inequalities are the expressions that may be written in the form

:&lt;math&gt; f(\bar{x}) &lt; b &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; f(\bar{x}) \leq b,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''f'' is a [[linear form]] (also called a ''linear functional''), &lt;math&gt;\bar{x} = (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; and ''b'' a constant real number.
 
More concretely, this may be written out as
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n &lt; b &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n \leq b.&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are called the unknowns, and &lt;math&gt;a_{1}, a_{2},..., a_{n}&lt;/math&gt; are called the coefficients.

Alternatively, these may be written as

:&lt;math&gt; g(x) &lt; 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; g(x) \leq 0,&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''g'' is an [[affine function]].&lt;ref&gt;In the 2-dimensional case, both linear forms and affine functions are historically called ''linear functions'' because their graphs are lines. In other dimensions, neither type of function has a graph which is a line, so the generalization of linear function in two dimensions to higher dimensions is done by means of algebraic properties and this causes the split into two types of functions. However, the difference between affine functions and linear forms is just the addition of a constant.&lt;/ref&gt;

That is
: &lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
or
: &lt;math&gt;a_0 + a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n \leq 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that any inequality containing a "greater than" or a "greater than or equal" sign can be rewritten with a "less than" or "less than or equal" sign, so there is no need to define linear inequalities using those signs.

===Systems of linear inequalities===
A system of linear inequalities is a set of linear inequalities in the same variables:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{7}
a_{11} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{12} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{1n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; \leq \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_1      \\
a_{21} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{22} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{2n} x_n &amp;&amp;\; \leq \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_2      \\
\vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;              &amp;&amp; \vdots\;\;\; &amp;&amp;     &amp;&amp;&amp; \;\vdots \\
a_{m1} x_1 &amp;&amp;\; + \;&amp;&amp; a_{m2} x_2 &amp;&amp;\; + \cdots + \;&amp;&amp; a_{mn} x_n &amp;&amp;\; \leq \;&amp;&amp;&amp; b_m      \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;
Here &lt;math&gt;x_1,\ x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; are the unknowns, &lt;math&gt;a_{11},\ a_{12},...,\ a_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; are the coefficients of the system, and &lt;math&gt;b_1,\ b_2,...,b_m&lt;/math&gt; are the constant terms.

This can be concisely written as the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] inequality

:&lt;math&gt;Ax \leq b,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is an ''m''&amp;times;''n'' matrix, ''x'' is an ''n''&amp;times;1 [[column vector]] of variables, and ''b'' is an ''m''&amp;times;1 column vector of constants.

In the above systems both strict and non-strict inequalities may be used.

*Not all systems of linear inequalities have solutions.

===Applications ===

====Polyhedra====
The set of solutions of a real linear inequality constitutes a [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]] of the 'n'-dimensional real space, one of the two defined by the corresponding linear equation.

The set of solutions of a system of linear inequalities corresponds to the intersection of the half-spaces defined by individual inequalities. It is a [[convex set]], since the half-spaces are convex sets, and the intersection of a set of convex sets is also convex. In the non-[[degenerate case]]s this convex set is a [[convex polyhedron]] (possibly unbounded, e.g., a half-space, a slab between two parallel half-spaces or a [[polyhedral cone]]). It may also be empty or a convex polyhedron of lower dimension confined to an [[affine subspace]] of the ''n''-dimensional space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Linear programming====
{{main|Linear programming}}

A linear programming problem seeks to optimize (find a maximum or minimum value) a function (called the ''objective function'') subject to a number of constraints on the variables which, in general, are linear inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Angel|Porter|1989|loc=p. 373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of constraints is a system of linear inequalities.

==Generalization==

The above definition requires well-defined operations of [[addition]], [[multiplication]] and [[Comparison (mathematics)|comparison]]; therefore, the notion of a linear inequality may be extended to [[ordered ring]]s, and in particular to [[ordered field]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3058">In [[mathematics]], a '''Lipschitz domain''' (or '''domain with Lipschitz boundary''') is a [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] in [[Euclidean space]] whose boundary is "sufficiently regular" in the sense that it can be thought of as locally being the graph of a [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous function]]. The term is named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Rudolf Lipschitz]].

Such domains are also called '''strongly Lipschitz domains''' to contrast them with weakly Lipschitz domains, which are a more general class of domains. A '''weakly Lipschitz domain''' is a domain whose boundary is locally flattable by a Lipschitzeomorphism.

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt;n \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; be an [[open set|open]] [[subset]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;
and let &lt;math&gt;\partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. 
Then &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''Lipschitz domain''' 
if for every point &lt;math&gt; p \in \partial\Omega &lt;/math&gt;
there exists a hyperplane &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;,
a Lipschitz-continuous function &lt;math&gt;g : H \rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; over that hyperplane,
and the values &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that 
* &lt;math&gt;\Omega \cap C = \left\{\; x + y \vec n \;|\; x \in B_r(p) \cap H,\ -h &lt; y &lt; g(x) \;\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\partial\Omega) \cap C = \left\{\; x + y \vec n \;|\; x \in B_r(p) \cap H,\ g(x) = y \;\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;\vec n&lt;/math&gt; is a unit vector that is normal to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;B_{r} (p) := \{\; x \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \;|\; \| x - p \| &lt; r \;\}&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;C := \left\{\; x + y \vec n \;|\; x \in B_r(p) \cap H,\ -h &lt; y &lt; h \;\right\}&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''weakly Lipschitz''' if for every point &lt;math&gt;p \in \partial\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a radius &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and a map &lt;math&gt;l_p : B_r(p) \rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; is a [[bijection]];
* &lt;math&gt;l_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l_p^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; are both Lipschitz continuous functions;
* &lt;math&gt;l_p\left( \partial\Omega \cap B_r(p) \right) = Q_0&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;l_p\left( \Omega \cap B_r(p) \right) = Q_+&lt;/math&gt;;
where &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; denotes the unit ball &lt;math&gt;B_1(0)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{0} := \{\; (x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) \in Q \;|\; x_{n} = 0 \;\};&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q_{+} := \{\; (x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}) \in Q \;|\; x_{n} &gt; 0 \;\}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications of Lipschitz domains==

Many of the [[Sobolev inequality|Sobolev embedding theorems]] require that the domain of study be a Lipschitz domain. Consequently, many [[partial differential equation]]s and [[calculus of variations|variational problems]] are defined on Lipschitz domains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6040">'''Loss reserving''' refers to the calculation of the required reserves for a [[tranche]] of general [[insurance]] business.&lt;ref name="BornFerg"&gt;'''Schmidt''', K. D., '''Zocher''', M.,
[http://www.variancejournal.org/issues/02-01/85.pdf The Bornhuetter-Ferguson Principle], Variance 2:1, 2008, pp. 85-110.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes '''outstanding claims reserves'''.

Typically, the claims reserves represent the money which should be held by the insurer so as to be able to meet all future [[Claim (legal)|claims]] arising from policies currently in force and policies written in the past.

Methods of calculating reserves in [[general insurance]] are different from those used in [[life insurance]], [[pension]]s and [[health insurance]] since general insurance contracts are typically of a much shorter duration. Most general insurance contracts are written for a period of one year, and typically there is only one payment of [[Insurance premium|premium]] at the start of the contract in exchange for coverage over the year. Reserves are calculated differently from contracts of a longer duration with multiple premium payments since there are no future premiums to consider in this case. The reserves are calculated by forecasting future losses from past losses.

==Methods==
The most popular methods of claims reserving include the [[chain-ladder method|chain-ladder]] method and the [[Bornhuetter-Ferguson method|Bornhuetter-Ferguson]] method.

The [[chain-ladder method]], also known as the development method, assumes that past experience is an indicator of future experience. [[Loss development factor|Loss development]] patterns in the past are used to estimate how claim amounts will increase (or decrease) in the future.

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses both past loss development as well as an independently derived prior estimate of ultimate expected losses.&lt;ref name="BornFerg"/&gt;

==Outstanding claims reserves==
'''Outstanding claims reserves''' in [[general insurance]] are a type of [[technical reserve]] or accounting [[provision (accounting)|provision]] in the [[financial statements]] of an insurer. They seek to quantify the have loss liabilities for insurance claims which have been reported and not yet settled
(RBNS) or which have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) reserves. This is a technical reserve of an insurance company, and is established to provide for the future liability for claims which have occurred but which have not yet been settled.

An insurance policy provides, in return for the payment of a premium, acceptance of the liability to make payments to the insured person on the occurrence of one or more specified events (insurance claims) over a specific time period. The occurrence of the specified events and the amount of the payment are both usually modeled as [[random variables]]. In general, there is a delay in the insurer's settlement of the claim, typical reasons are (i) reporting delay (time gap between
claims occurrence and claims reporting at the insurance company); (ii) settlement delay because
it usually takes time to evaluate the whole size of the claim. The time difference between
claims occurrence and claims closing (final settlement) can take days (e.g. in property insurance)
but it can also take years (typically in liability insurance).

Claims reserving now means, that the insurance company puts sufficient provisions from the premium payments aside, so that it is able to settle all the claims that
are caused by these insurance contracts. This is different from social insurance where one typically has a pay-as-you-go system which means that premium payments are not matched to the contracts that cause the claims&lt;ref name="Wüthrich-Merz 2008"&gt;'''Wüthrich''', M.V., '''Merz''', M., ''Stochastic Claims Reserving Methods in Insurance'', Wiley Finance, 2008, Section 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Method of estimation ===
Various statistical methods have been established for the calculation of outstanding claims reserves in general insurance. These include:&lt;ref name="Wüthrich-Merz 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Benjamin''', B., ''General Insurance'', Heinemann, 1987, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Taylor''', G., ''Loss Reserving: An Actuarial Perspective'', Kluwer, 2000, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Paid-incurred chain (PIC) claims reserving model
* Bootstrap methods
* Bayesian methods

Most of these methods started off as ''deterministic'' algorithms. Later actuaries started to develop and analyze underlying stochastic models that justify these algorithms. Probably, the most popular stochastic model is the distribution-free chain ladder method which was developed by T. Mack.&lt;ref&gt;'''Mack''', T., ''Distribution-free calculation of the standard error of chain ladder reserves estimates'', ASTIN Bulletin 23/2, 213-225, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; These stochastic methods allow to analyze and quantify the prediction uncertainty in the outstanding loss liabilities. Classical analysis studies the total prediction uncertainty, whereas recent research (under the influence of Solvency 2) also studies the one-year uncertainty, called claims development result (CDR).&lt;ref&gt;'''Merz''', M., '''Wüthrich''', M.V., ''Modelling the claims development result for solvency purposes'', CAS E-Forum, Fall 2008, 542-568, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''England''', P.D., '''Verrall''', R.J., ''Stochastic claims reserving in general insurance'', British Actuarial Journal 8/3, 443-518, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wüthrich-Merz 2008"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cryptography]], '''M8''' is a [[block cipher]] designed by [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] in 1999. It is a modification of Hitachi's earlier [[M6 (cipher)|M6]] algorithm, designed for greater security and high performance in both hardware and 32-bit software implementations.

Like M6, M8 is a 10-round [[Feistel cipher]] with a [[block size (cryptography)|block size]] of 64 bits. The round function can include [[bit rotation]]s, [[XOR]]s, and [[modular arithmetic|modular addition]], but the structure of each round function used is determined by the [[key (cryptography)|key]]. Making these variations key-dependent is intended to make [[cryptanalysis]] more difficult (see [[FROG]] for a similar design philosophy).

'''Morton Brown''' (born August 12, 1931, in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) is an American mathematician, who specializes in [[geometric topology]].

In 1958 Brown earned his Ph.D. from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] under [[R. H. Bing]]. From 1960 to 1962 he was at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. Afterwards he became a professor at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]].

With [[Barry Mazur]] in 1965 he won the [[Oswald Veblen prize]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-prizes/veblen-prize&lt;/ref&gt; for their independent and nearly simultaneous proofs of the [[Schönflies problem|generalized Schoenflies hypothesis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brown, Morton |year=1960 |title= A proof of the generalized Schoenflies theorem |journal= Bull.

[[Image:Parallel Scale Nomogram.svg|right|400px|thumb|A typical parallel-scale nomogram. This example calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17 are substituted into the equation. The isopleth crosses the scale for T at just under 4.65.]]

A '''nomogram''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] νόμος ''nomos'', "law" and γραμμή ''grammē'', "line"), also called a '''nomograph''', '''alignment chart''' or '''abaque''', is a graphical calculating device, a two-dimensional diagram designed to allow the approximate graphical computation of a [[Function (mathematics)|mathematical function]]. The field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer [[Philbert Maurice d'Ocagne|Philbert Maurice d’Ocagne]] (1862-1938) and used extensively for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas to a practical precision. Nomograms use a parallel [[coordinate system]] invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard [[Cartesian coordinates]].

A nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. The result is obtained by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an ''index line'' or ''isopleth''.

Nomograms flourished in many different contexts for roughly 75 years because they allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are obtained very quickly and reliably by simply drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a [[slide rule]], or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. In addition, nomograms naturally incorporate implicit or explicit [[domain knowledge]] into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. 
[[Image:Smith chart gen.svg|right|thumbnail|250px|An impedance [[Smith chart]] (with no data plotted)]]

Like a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device, and like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned. While the slide rule is intended to be a general-purpose device, a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation, with tables of values effectively built into the construction of the [[Scale (ratio)|scales]]. Nomograms are typically used in applications where the level of accuracy  they offer is sufficient and useful. Alternatively, a nomogram can be used to check an answer obtained from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation. 

Other types of graphical calculators such as '''intercept charts''', '''trilinear diagrams''' and '''hexagonal charts''' are sometimes called nomograms. Other such examples include the [[Smith chart]], a graphical calculator used in [[electronics]] and [[systems analysis]], [[thermodynamic diagram]]s and [[tephigram]]s, used to plot the vertical structure of the atmosphere and perform calculations on its stability and humidity content. These do not meet the strict definition of a nomogram as a graphical calculator whose solution is found by the use of one or more linear isopleths.

==Description==
[[Image:Components of a Nomogram.png|right|300px|thumb|Components of a parallel-scale nomogram]]
A nomogram for a three-variable equation typically has three scales, although there exist nomograms in which two or even all three scales are common. Here two scales represent known values and the third is the scale where the result is read off.  The simplest such equation is ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for the three variables ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. An example of this type of nomogram is shown on the right, annotated with terms used to describe the parts of a nomogram.

More complicated equations can sometimes be expressed as the sum of functions of the three variables. For example, the nomogram at the top of this article could be constructed as a parallel-scale nomogram because it can be expressed as such a sum after taking logarithms of both sides of the equation.

The scale for the unknown variable can lie between the other two scales or outside of them. The known values of the calculation are marked on the scales for those variables, and a line is drawn between these marks. The result is read off the unknown scale at the point where the line intersects that scale. The scales include 'tick marks' to indicate exact number locations, and they may also include labeled reference values. These scales may be [[linear]], [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]], or have some more complex relationship.

The sample isopleth shown in red on the nomogram at the top of this article calculates the value of ''T'' when ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.30 and ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.17. The isopleth crosses the scale for ''T'' at just under 4.65; a larger figure printed in high resolution on paper would yield ''T''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.64 to three-digit precision. Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.

Straight scales are useful for relatively simple calculations, but for more complex calculations the use of simple or elaborate curved scales may be required. Nomograms for more than three variables can be constructed by incorporating a grid of scales for two of the variables, or by concatenating individual nomograms of fewer numbers of variables into a compound nomogram.

==Applications==
Nomograms have been used in an extensive array of applications. A sample includes

* The original application by d'Ocagne, the automation of complicated [[cut and fill]] calculations for earth removal during the construction of the French national railway system. This was an important proof of concept, because the calculations are non-trivial and the results translated into significant savings of time, effort, and money.
* The design of channels, pipes and weirs for regulating the flow of water.
* The work of [[Lawrence Henderson]], in which nomograms were used to correlate many different aspects of blood physiology. It was the first major use of nomograms in the United States and also the first medical nomograms anywhere. Nomograms continue to be used extensively in medical fields.
* Ballistics calculations prior to fire control systems, where calculating time was critical.
* Machine shop calculations, to convert blueprint dimensions and perform calculations based on material dimensions and properties. These nomograms often included markings for standard dimensions and for available manufactured parts.
* Statistics, for complicated calculations of properties of distributions and for operations research including the design of acceptance tests for quality control.
* Operations Research, to obtain results in a variety of optimization problems.
* Chemistry and chemical engineering, to encapsulate both general physical relationships and empirical data for specific compounds.
* Aeronautics, in which nomograms were used for decades in the cockpits of aircraft of all descriptions. As a navigation and flight control aid, nomograms were fast, compact and easy-to-use calculators.
* Astronomical calculations, as in the post-launch orbital calculations of [[Sputnik 1]] by P.E. Elyasberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin Yu.A.Mozzhorin Memories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018165625/http://rgantd.ru/book_2.php?link=mozjorin |date=2007-10-18 }} at the website of Russian state archive for scientific-technical documentation&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engineering work of all kinds: Electrical design of filters and transmission lines, mechanical calculations of stress and loading, optical calculations, and so forth.
* Military, where complex calculations need to be made in the field quickly and with reliability not dependent on electrical devices.
*[[Seismology]], where nomograms have been developed to estimate earthquake [http://web.csulb.edu/~rodrigue/geog458558/labs/nomogram.html magnitude]

==Examples==

===Parallel-resistance/thin-lens===
[[Image:Nomogramparallelresistance.svg|right|200px|thumb|Parallel [[electrical resistance]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below performs the computation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1/A+1/B}=\frac{AB}{A+B}&lt;/math&gt;

This nomogram is interesting because it performs a useful nonlinear calculation using only straight-line, equally graduated scales. While the diagonal line has a scale &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times larger than the axes scales, the numbers on it exactly match those directly below or to its left, and thus it can be easily created by drawing a straight line diagonally on a sheet of [[graph paper]].

''A'' and ''B'' are entered on the horizontal and vertical scales, and the result is read from the diagonal scale.  Being proportional to the [[harmonic mean]] of ''A'' and ''B'', this formula has several applications.  For example, it is the [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel-resistance formula]] in [[electronics]], and the [[Thin lens|thin-lens equation]] in [[optics]].

In the example, the red line demonstrates that parallel resistors of 56 and 42&amp;nbsp;[[ohm]]s have a combined resistance of 24&amp;nbsp;ohms. It also demonstrates that an object at a distance of 56&amp;nbsp;cm from a [[lens (optics)|lens]] whose [[focal length]] is 24&amp;nbsp;cm forms a [[real image]] at a distance of 42&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Chi-squared test computation===
[[Image:chisquarenomo3.png|right|200px|thumb|[[Chi-squared distribution]] nomogram]]
The nomogram below can be used to perform an approximate computation of some values needed when performing a familiar statistical test, [[Pearson's chi-squared test]]. This nomogram demonstrates the use of curved scales with unevenly spaced graduations.

The relevant expression is

:&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;

The scale along the top is shared among five different ranges of observed values: A, B, C, D and E. The observed value is found in one of these ranges, and the tick mark used on that scale is found immediately above it. Then the curved scale used for the expected value is selected based on the range. For example, an observed value of 9 would use the tick mark above the 9 in range A, and curved scale A would be used for the expected value. An observed value of 81 would use the tick mark above 81 in range E, and curved scale E would be used for the expected value. This allows five different nomograms to be incorporated into a single diagram.

In this manner, the blue line demonstrates the computation of

:(9 &amp;minus; 5)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/ 5 = 3.2

and the red line demonstrates the computation of

:(81 &amp;minus; 70)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / 70 = 1.7

In performing the test, [[Yates's correction for continuity]] is often applied, and simply involves subtracting 0.5 from the observed values. A nomogram for performing the test with Yates's correction could be constructed simply by shifting each "observed" scale half a unit to the left, so that the 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, ... graduations are placed where the values 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... appear on the present chart.

===Food risk assessment===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food [[risk assessment]] nomogram]]
Although nomograms represent mathematical relationships, not all are mathematically derived.  The following one was developed graphically to achieve appropriate end results that could readily be defined by the product of their relationships in subjective units rather than numerically. The use of non-parallel axes enabled the non-linear relationships to be incorporated into the model.

The numbers in square boxes denote the axes requiring input after appropriate assessment.

The pair of nomograms at the top of the image determine the probability of occurrence and the availability, which are then incorporated into the bottom multistage nomogram.

Lines 8 and 10 are ‘tie lines’ or ‘pivot lines’ and are used for the transition between the stages of the compound nomogram.

The final pair of parallel logarithmic scales (12) are not nomograms as such, but reading-off scales to translate the risk score (11, remote to extremely high) into a sampling frequency to address safety aspects and other ‘consumer protection’ aspects respectively.  This stage requires political ‘buy in’ balancing cost against risk.  The example uses a three-year minimum frequency for each, though with the high risk end of the scales different for the two aspects, giving different frequencies for the two, but both subject to an overall minimum sampling of every food for all aspects at least once every three years.

This [[risk assessment]] nomogram was developed by the [[Public analyst|UK Public Analyst Service]] with funding from the [[Food Standards Agency|UK Food Standards Agency]] for use as a tool to guide the appropriate frequency of sampling and analysis of food for official food control purposes, intended to be used to assess all potential problems with all foods, although not yet adopted.

===Sample size estimation===
[[File:Power0501.pdf|thumb|Nomograph for Sample Size Estimation]]

This nomograph can be used to estimate the sample size requirements for statistical analyses. It uses four parameters: ''&amp;alpha;'' (fixed), effect size (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;''), statistical power, and number of cases ''N'' (two scales for ''&amp;alpha;'' = .05 (liberal) or .01 (conservative)).

The hypothesized effect size in the population can either be expressed as a correlation coefficient (''&amp;rho;'') or a normalized difference in means (''&amp;delta;'') for a [[T-test]]. The normalized difference is equal to the absolute value of the difference between two population means (''&amp;mu;''₁ &amp;minus; ''&amp;mu;''₂), divided by the pooled standard deviation (''s'').

The statistical power desired is estimated by 1 &amp;minus; ''&amp;beta;'', where ''&amp;beta;'' is equal to the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;II error. A [[type II error|''Type&amp;nbsp;II'' error]] is failing to reject the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact the null hypothesis is false in the population and should be rejected. Cohen (1977)&lt;ref name=Cohen_1977&gt;Cohen, J. (1977). ''Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences'', 2nd.&amp;nbsp;ed. San Diego, CA: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; recommends using power equal to 0.80 or 80%, for a ''&amp;beta;'' = 0.20&amp;nbsp;.

The sample size or number of cases required is reported for two standard levels of statistical significance (''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 or 0.05). The value of ''&amp;alpha;'' is the probability of making a Type&amp;nbsp;I error. A [[type I error|''Type&amp;nbsp;I'' error]] is rejecting the statistical null hypothesis (i.e., claiming that either ''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'' is zero), when in fact it ''is'' true (the value ''is'' zero) in the population and should ''not'' be rejected. The most commonly used values of &amp;alpha; are 0.05 or 0.01&amp;nbsp;.

To find the sample size requirements for a given statistical analysis, estimate the effect size expected in the population (''&amp;rho;'' or ''&amp;delta;'') on the left hand axis, select the desired level of power on the right hand axis, and draw a line between the two values.

Where the line intersects with either the ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.05 or ''&amp;alpha;'' = 0.01 middle axis will indicate the sample size required to achieve statistical significance of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05 or 0.01, respectively (for the previously given parameters).

For instance, if one estimates the population correlation (''&amp;rho;'') to be 0.30, and desires statistical power equal to 0.80, then to obtain a significance level of ''&amp;alpha;'' less than 0.05, the sample size requirement would be ''N'' = 70 cases rounded up (more precisely approximately 68&amp;nbsp;cases using interpolation).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">In the mathematical field of [[computability theory]], a '''PA degree''' is a [[Turing degree]] that computes a complete extension of [[Peano arithmetic]]&amp;nbsp;(Jockusch&amp;nbsp;1987). These degrees are closely related to fixed-point-free (DNR) functions, and have been thoroughly investigated in recursion theory.

== Background ==

In recursion theory, &lt;math&gt;\phi_e&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[computable function]] with index (program) ''e'' in some standard numbering of computable functions, and &lt;math&gt;\phi^B_e&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ''e''th computable function using a set ''B'' of natural numbers as an oracle.

A set ''A'' of natural numbers is [[Turing reducibility|Turing reducible]] to a set ''B'' if there is a [[computable function]] that, given an oracle for set ''B'', computes the [[indicator function|characteristic function]] &amp;chi;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; of the set ''A''. That is,  there is an ''e'' such that &lt;math&gt;\chi_A = \phi^B_e&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship is denoted ''A'' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''B''; the relation &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[preorder]].

Two sets of natural numbers are [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] if each is Turing reducible to the other. The notation ''A'' &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; ''B'' indicates ''A'' and ''B'' are Turing equivalent. The relation &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is an equivalence relation known as Turing equivalence. A [[Turing degree]] is a collection of sets of natural numbers, such that any two sets in the collection are Turing equivalent. Equivalently, a Turing degree is an equivalence class of the relation &amp;equiv;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Turing degrees are [[partial order|partially ordered]] by Turing reducibility. The notation '''a''' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''b''' indicates there is a set in degree '''b''' that computes a set in degree '''a'''. Equivalently, '''a''' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''b''' holds if and only if every set in '''b''' computes every set in '''a'''.

A function ''f'' from the natural numbers to the natural numbers is said to be diagonally nonrecursive (DNR) if, for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;f(n) \not = \phi_n(n)&lt;/math&gt; (here inequality holds by definition if &lt;math&gt;\phi_n(n)&lt;/math&gt; is undefined).  If the range of ''f'' is the set {0,1} then ''f'' is a DNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; function. It is known that there are DNR functions that do not compute any DNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; function.

== Completions of Peano arithmetic ==

A completion of [[Peano arithmetic]] is a set of formulas in the language of Peano arithmetic, such that the set is consistent in first-order logic and such that, for each formula, either that formula or its negation is included in the set. Once a Gödel numbering of the formulas in the language of PA has been fixed, it is possible to identify completions of PA with sets of natural numbers, and thus to speak about the computability of these completions.

A Turing degree is defined to be a '''PA degree''' if there is a set of natural numbers in the degree that computes a completion of Peano Arithmetic. (This is equivalent to the proposition that every set in the degree computes a completion of PA.) Because there are no computable completions of PA, the degree '''0''' consisting of the computable sets of natural numbers is not a PA degree.

Because PA is an effective first-order theory, the completions of PA can be characterized as the infinite paths through a particular computable subtree of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the PA degrees are exactly the degrees that compute an infinite path through this tree.

== Properties ==

The PA degrees are upward closed in the Turing degrees: if '''a''' is a PA degree and '''a''' &amp;le;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; '''b''' then '''b''' is a PA degree.

The Turing degree '''0'''‘, which is the degree of the [[halting problem]], is a PA degree. There are also PA degrees that are not above '''0'''‘. For example, the [[low basis theorem]] implies that there is a low PA degree.  On the other hand, [[Antonín Kučera]] has proved that there is a degree less than '''0'''‘ that computes a DNR function but is not a PA degree (Jockusch&amp;nbsp;1989:197).

[[Carl Jockusch]] and [[Robert Soare]]&amp;nbsp;(1972) proved that the PA degrees are exactly the degrees of DNR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; functions.

By definition, a degree is PA if and only if it computes a path through the tree of completions of Peano arithmetic. A stronger property holds: a degree '''a''' is a PA degree if and only if '''a''' computes a path through ''every'' infinite computable subtree of 2&lt;sup&gt;&lt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Simpson&amp;nbsp;1977).

Many '''paper size''' standards conventions have existed at different times and in different countries. Today, the A and B series of [[ISO 216]], which includes the commonly used A4 size, are the international standard used by almost every country. However, in many countries in [[the Americas]] as well as in the [[Philippines]], the North American series of [[paper]] sizes such as '[[Letter (paper size)|Letter]]' and '[[Legal (paper size)|Legal]]' is more prevalent.&lt;ref name="CLDR"/&gt; 

Paper sizes affect writing paper, [[stationery]], cards, and some printed documents. The international standard for envelopes is the C series of [[ISO 269]]
P10 size is the smallest of them all, containing less than 10 micrometers of paper

== International paper sizes ==

{{Main article|ISO 216}}
{{Hatnote|See [[Switching barriers|Switching costs]], [[Network effect]]s and [[Standardization]] for possible reasons for differing regional adoption rates of the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard sizes.}}

The international paper size standard is [[ISO 216]].  It is based on the German [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 476 standard for paper sizes. ISO paper sizes are all based on a single [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of the [[square root of 2]], or approximately 1:1.4142. There are different series, as well as several extensions.

The following international paper sizes are included in [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS): ''A3'', ''A4'', ''A5'', ''B4'', ''B5''.&lt;ref name="mozilla.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@page/size|title=size|publisher=|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A series ===

[[File:A size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ISO A series.]]
The base A0 size of paper is defined as having an area of 1&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}} and a dimension ratio of 1 to {{sqrt|2}}, making the A0 paper size exactly &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[4]{2}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;m × &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt[4]{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;m. Rounded to the nearest millimetre, that is {{convert|841|x|1189|mm|in}}.

Successive paper sizes in the series A1, A2, A3, and so forth, are defined by halving the preceding paper size across the larger dimension. This also effectively halves the area of each sheet. The most frequently used paper size is A4 measuring {{convert|210|x|297|mm|in|sigfig=3}}.

The significant advantage of this system is its scaling: if a sheet with an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} is divided into two equal halves parallel to its shortest sides, then the halves will again have an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}}. Folded brochures of any size can be made by using sheets of the next larger size, e.g. A4 sheets are folded to make A5 brochures. The system allows scaling without compromising the [[aspect ratio]] from one size to another—as provided by office photocopiers, e.g. enlarging A4 to A3 or reducing A3 to A4. Similarly, two sheets of A4 can be scaled down and fit exactly on 1 sheet without any cutoff or margins.

The behavior of the aspect ratio is easily proven: on a sheet of paper, let ''a'' be the long side and ''b'' be the short side; thus, {{sfrac|''a''|''b''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}. When the sheet of paper is folded in half widthwise, let ''c'' be the length of the new short side: ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|''a''|2}}. If we take the ratio of the newly folded paper we have:

&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{b}{c}=\frac{b}{\frac{a}{2}}=\frac{2}{\frac{a}{b}}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}}=\sqrt{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the aspect ratio is preserved for the new dimensions of the folded paper.

[[Paper density#Basis weight|Weight]]s are easy to calculate as well: a standard A4 sheet made from 80&amp;nbsp;g/m{{sup|2}} paper weighs 5&amp;nbsp;g (as it is {{frac|16}} of an A0 page, measuring 1&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}}), allowing one to easily compute the weight—and associated postage rate—by counting the number of sheets used.

The advantages of basing a paper size upon an aspect ratio of {{sqrt|2}} were first noted in 1786 by the [[Germany|German]] scientist and philosopher [[Georg Christoph Lichtenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/lichtenberg-letter.html |title=Lichtenberg’s letter to Johann Beckmann |publisher=Cl.cam.ac.uk |date=2006-02-07 |accessdate=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The formats that became A2, A3, B3, B4 and B5 were developed in France on proposition of the mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] and published for judiciary purpose in 1798 during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="B237"&gt;{{cite journal |date=1798-11-03 |title=Loi sur le timbre (Nº 2136) |journal=Bulletin des lois de la République |publisher=French government |location=Paris |issue=237 |pages=1–2 |language=French |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/loi-timbre.html |accessdate=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 20th century, Dr Walter Porstmann turned Lichtenberg's idea into a proper system of different paper sizes. Porstmann's system was introduced as a DIN standard (DIN 476) in Germany in 1922, replacing a vast variety of other paper formats. Even today, the paper sizes are called "DIN A4" ({{IPA-de|diːn.ʔaː.fiːɐ̯|IPA}}) in everyday use in Germany and Austria.

The DIN 476 standard spread quickly to other countries. Before the outbreak of [[World War II]], it had been adopted by the following countries:

During World War II, the standard was adopted by [[Uruguay]] (1942), [[Argentina]] (1943) and [[Brazil]] (1943), and afterwards spread to other countries:

By 1975, so many countries were using the German system that it was established as an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard, as well as the official [[United Nations]] document format. By 1977, A4 was the standard letter format in 88 of 148 countries.  Today the standard has been adopted by all countries in the world except the United States and Canada. In Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Chile]], and the [[Philippines]], the [[Letter (paper size)|US letter]] format is still in common use, despite their official adoption of the ISO standard.

=== B series ===

[[File:B size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ISO B series.]]
In addition to the A series, there is a less common B series. The area of B series sheets is the [[geometric mean]] of successive A series sheets. So, B1 is between A0 and A1 in size, with an area of 0.707&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}} ({{frac|{{sqrt|2}}}}&amp;nbsp;m{{sup|2}}). As a result, B0 is 1 metre wide, and other sizes in the B series are a half, a quarter or further fractions of a metre wide. While less common in office use, it is used for a variety of special situations. Many posters use B-series paper or a close approximation, such as 50&amp;nbsp;cm × 70&amp;nbsp;cm; B5 is a relatively common choice for books. The B series is also used for [[envelope]]s and [[passport]]s. The B-series is widely used in the [[printing]] industry to describe both paper sizes and [[printing press]] sizes, including [[Digital printing|digital presses]]. B3 paper is used to print two US letter or A4 pages side by side using [[imposition]]; four pages would be printed on B2, eight on B1, etc.

=== C series ===

[[File:C size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ISO C series.]]
The C series is usually used for envelopes and is defined in [[ISO 269]]. The area of C series sheets is the geometric mean of the areas of the A and B series sheets of the same number; for instance, the area of a C4 sheet is the geometric mean of the areas of an A4 sheet and a B4 sheet. This means that C4 is slightly larger than A4, and slightly smaller than B4. The practical usage of this is that a letter written on A4 paper fits inside a C4 envelope, and both A4 and C4 paper fits inside a B4 envelope.

Some envelope formats with mixed sides from adjacent sizes (and thus an approximate aspect ratio of 2:1) are also defined in national adaptations of the ISO standard, e.g. DIN C6/C5 is 114&amp;nbsp;mm × 229&amp;nbsp;mm where the common side to C5 and C6 is 162&amp;nbsp;mm.

The &amp;alpha; variables are the distinct first terms in the three [[geometric progression]]s of the same ''common-ratio'' equal to the square root of two. Each of the three geometric progressions (corresponding to the three series A, B, C) is formed by all possible paper dimensions (length and width) of the series arranged in a decreasing order. This interesting arrangement of dimensions is also very useful - not only it forms a geometric progression with easy to remember formulae, it also has that each consecutive pair of values (like a sliding window of size 2) will automatically correspond to the dimensions of a standard paper format in the series.

The [[tolerances]] specified in the standard are

* ±1.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.06&amp;nbsp;in) for dimensions up to 150&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in),
* ±2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.08&amp;nbsp;in) for lengths in the range 150 to 600&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9 to 23.6 in) and
* ±3&amp;nbsp;mm (0.12&amp;nbsp;in) for any dimension above 600&amp;nbsp;mm (23.6&amp;nbsp;in).

=== German extensions ===

The German standard '''DIN 476''' was published on 18 August 1922 and is the original specification of the A, B and C sizes. In 1991, it was split into DIN 476-1 for the A and B formats on the one hand and 476-2 for the C series on the other hand. The former has been withdrawn in 2002 in favor of adopting the international standard as DIN EN ISO 216, but part 2 has been retained and was last updated in 2008. 

The first and the second editions of DIN 476 from 1922 and 1925 also included a D series.

DIN 476 provides for formats larger than A0, denoted by a prefix factor. In particular, it lists the formats 2A0 and 4A0, which are twice and four times the size of A0 respectively.
However, ISO 216:2007 notes 2A0 and 4A0 in the table of ''Main series of trimmed sizes'' (ISO A series) as well: "The rarely used sizes [2A0 and 4A0] which follow also belong to this series."

DIN 476 also used to specify slightly tighter tolerances than ISO 216:

* ±1&amp;nbsp;mm (0.04&amp;nbsp;in) for dimensions up to 150&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9&amp;nbsp;in),
* ±1.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.06&amp;nbsp;in) for lengths in the range 150&amp;nbsp;mm to 600&amp;nbsp;mm (5.9 to 23.6 in) and
* ±2&amp;nbsp;mm (0.08&amp;nbsp;in) for any dimension above 600&amp;nbsp;mm (23.6&amp;nbsp;in).

[[File:SIS 014711 Paper Sizes.svg|thumb|200px|Comparison of ISO 216 and Swedish standard SIS 014711 paper sizes between A4 and A3 sizes.]]

The Swedish standard [[Swedish Standards Institute|SIS]] 014711&lt;ref name="ss014711"&gt;{{cite web |title=Papper&amp;nbsp;— Formatserier A-G |url=http://www.sis.se/pappersteknik/pappersprodukter/ss-14711 |work=Svensk standard |publisher=Swedish Standards Institute |accessdate=30 October 2013 }} {{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;  generalized the ISO system of A, B, and C formats by adding D, E, F, and G formats to it. Its D format sits between a B format and the next larger A format (just like C sits between A and the next larger B). The remaining formats fit in between all these formats, such that the sequence of formats A4, E4, C4, G4, B4, F4, D4, ''H4'', A3 is a [[geometric progression]], in which the dimensions grow by a factor {{radic|2|16}} from one size to the next. However, this SIS standard does not define any size between a D format and the next larger A format (called H in the previous example). 

Of these additional formats, G5 (169 × 239&amp;nbsp;mm) and E5 (155 × 220&amp;nbsp;mm) are popular in Sweden and the Netherlands for printing dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://ki.se/content/1/c6/05/90/62/Typography_en.pdf |publisher=Karolinska University press |title=Print format for dissertations }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the other formats have not turned out to be particularly useful in practice and they have not been adopted internationally.

The Swedish and German D series basically contain the same sizes, but are offset by one, i.e. DIN D4 equals SIS D5 and so on.

=== Japanese B-series variant ===

The [[Japanese Industrial Standards|JIS]] defines two main series of paper sizes. The JIS A-series is identical to the ISO A-series, but with slightly different tolerances. The area of B-series paper is 1.5 times that of the corresponding A-paper (instead of the factor {{sqrt|2}} = 1.414... for the ISO B-series), so the length ratio is approximately 1.22 times the length of the corresponding A-series paper. The aspect ratio of the paper is the same as for A-series paper. Both A- and B-series paper is widely available in Japan, [[Taiwan]] and China, and most photocopiers are loaded with at least A4 and either one of A3, B4 and B5 paper.

There are also a number of traditional paper sizes, which are now used mostly by printers. The most common of these old series are the Shiroku-ban and the Kiku paper sizes.

=== Chinese extensions ===
The Chinese standard GB/T 148-1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gb688.cn/bzgk/gb/newGbInfo?hcno=20746CFEE63514B24DD64A415CB65377|title=国家标准 {{!}} GB/T 148-1997|last=|first=|date=26 June 1997|website=Standardization Administration of China|access-date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which replaced GB 148-1989, documents the standard ISO series, A and B, but adds a custom D series. This Chinese format originates from the [[Republic of China (1912–49)]]. The D series is not identical to the Swedish D series. It does not strictly follow the same principles as ISO paper sizes: The aspect ratio is only very roughly {{radic|2}}. The short side of a size is always 4 mm longer than the long side of the next smaller size. The long side of a size is always exactly &amp;ndash; i.e. without further rounding &amp;ndash; twice as long as the short side of the next smaller size.

=== Soviet variants ===

The general adaptation of ISO 216 in the Soviet Union was GOST 9327-60. &lt;!--ОСТ 5115--&gt;
In its 1960 version, it lists formats down to A13, B12 and C8 and also specifies ½, ¼ and ⅛ prefixes for halving the shorter side (repeatedly), e.g. ½A4 = 105 mm × 297 mm.

[[File:Old Soviet standard for paper sizes.svg|thumb|A1, A2, A3, A4 and non-ISO sizes as GOST 3450-60 formats]]
A standard for technical drawings from 1960, GOST 3450-60&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://weldworld.ru/theory/cherchenie/formaty.html#link2 | title= Formaty | script-title= Форматы | trans-title= Formats | website= Мир Сварки | language= ru }}&lt;/ref&gt;, introduces alternative numeric format designations to deal with very high or very wide sheets.
These 2-digit codes are based upon A4 = "11": The first digit is the factor the longer side (297 mm) is multiplied by and the second digit is the one for the shorter side (210 mm), so "24" is 2×297 mm × 4×210 mm = 594 mm × 840 mm.

[[File:A4x8 a3x5 a2x4.png|thumb|A2, A3, A4 and some of their derived non-ISO sizes as GOST 2301-68 formats]]
GOST 3450-60 was replaced 8 years later by ESKD GOST 2301-68&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://graph.power.nstu.ru/wolchin/umm/eskd/eskd/GOST/2_301.htm | script-title=  Форматы (ЕСКД ГОСТ 2.301-68) | title= Formaty (ESKD GOST 2.301-68) | trans-title= Formats | website= Единая Система Конструкторской Документации | language= ru  }}&lt;/ref&gt;, but the numeric designations remained in popular use much longer.
The new designations were not purely numeric, but consisted of the ISO label followed by an 'x', or possibly the multiplication sign '×', and the factor, e.g. DIN 2A0 = GOST A0×2, but DIN 4A0 ≠ GOST A0×4, also listed are: A0×3, A1×3, A1×4, A2×3–A2×5, A3×3–A3×7, A4×3–A4×9. The formats …×1 and …×2 usually would be aliases for existing formats.

The United States, Canada, and the Philippines&lt;ref name="CLDR"&gt;Belize, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Philippines, Puerto Rico, United States, Venezuela according to {{cite|title=Territory Information|author=CLDR (version 31)|URL=https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_information.html}}, which is a data collection used by almost all software manufacturers.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily use a different system of paper sizes compared to the rest of the world. The current standard sizes are unique to those countries, although due to the size of the North American market and proliferation of both software and printing hardware from the region, other parts of the world have become increasingly familiar with these sizes (though not necessarily the paper itself). Some traditional North American inch-based sizes differ from the [[#Traditional inch-based paper sizes|Imperial British sizes]] described below.

==== Common loose sizes ====

''Letter, Legal'' and ''Ledger/Tabloid'' are by far the most commonly used of these for everyday activities, and the only ones included in [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS).

The origins of the exact dimensions of Letter size paper ({{convert|8+1/ 2|×|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are lost in tradition and not well documented. The American Forest and Paper Association argues that the dimension originates from the days of manual paper making, and that the 11-inch length of the page is about a quarter of "the average maximum stretch of an experienced vatman's arms."&lt;ref name="US"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afandpa.org/paper.aspx?id=511 |title=Why is the standard paper size in the U.S. 8½" x 11"? |accessdate=2009-08-04 |author=American Forest and Paper Association |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220192919/http://www.afandpa.org/paper.aspx?id=511 |archivedate=February 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not explain the width or aspect ratio.

Outside of North America, Letter size may also be known as "American Quarto".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dimensionsguide.com/junior-legal-paper-size/ |title=Junior Legal Paper Size |publisher=Dimensions Guide |accessdate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704081857/http://www.dimensionsguide.com/junior-legal-paper-size/ |archivedate=July 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If one accepts some trimming, the size is indeed one quarter of the old Imperial paper size known as Demy, {{convert|17+1/ 2|×|22+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fyffe |first=Charles |title=Basic Copyfitting |publisher=Studio Vista |year=1969 |location=London |isbn=0-289-79705-5 |page=74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

US paper sizes are currently standard in the United States and are the most commonly used formats at least in the Philippines, most of [[Mesoamerica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armada.mil.co/index.php?idcategoria=251610&amp;download=Y |title=Armada mil |accessdate=2010-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chile. The latter use US Letter, but their Legal size is one inch shorter than its US equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://qa.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=91260 |title=Request for inclusion of Page Size 8.5"×13" |accessdate=2008-08-11 |first=Rally |last=de Leon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico and Colombia, for instance, have adopted the ISO standard, but US Letter format is still the system in use throughout the country. It is virtually impossible to encounter ISO standard papers in day-to-day uses, with ''Carta'' (Letter), ''Oficio'' (Government-Legal) and ''Doble carta'' (Ledger/Tabloid) being nearly universal.

In Canada, US paper sizes are a de facto standard. The government, however, also uses ISO paper sizes.

==== Variant loose sizes ====

There is an additional paper size, {{convert|8|×|10+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, to which the name ''Government-Letter'' was given by the [[IEEE]] [[Printer Working Group]] (PWG). It was prescribed by [[Herbert Hoover]] when he was [[Secretary of Commerce]] to be used for US government forms, apparently to enable discounts from the purchase of paper for schools, but more likely due to the standard use of trimming books (after binding) and paper from the standard letter size paper to produce consistency and allow "bleed" printing. In later years, as photocopy machines proliferated, citizens wanted to make photocopies of the forms, but the machines did not generally have this size paper in their bins. [[Ronald Reagan]] therefore had the US government switch to regular Letter size, which is both half an inch longer and wider.&lt;ref name="US" /&gt; The former government size is still commonly used in spiral-bound [[notebook]]s, for children's writing and the like, a result of trimming from the current Letter dimensions.

By extension of the American standards, the halved Letter size, {{convert|5+1/ 2|×|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, meets the needs of many applications. It is variably known as ''Statement'', ''Stationery'', ''Memo'', ''Half Letter'', ''Half A'' (from ANSI sizes) or simply ''Half Size''. Like the similar-sized ISO A5, it is used for everything from personal letter writing to official aeronautical maps. Organizers, notepads, and diaries also often use this size of paper; thus 3-ring binders are also available in this size. Booklets of this size are created using word processing tools with landscape printing in two columns on letter paper which are then cut or folded into the final size.&lt;!--

==== Standardized American paper sizes ====
{{anchor|ANSI paper sizes}}[[File:ANSI size illustration2.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the ANSI sizes, superimposed on an "ANSI E" sheet.]]

In 1996&lt;!-- https://sizes.com/materials/paperUStech.htm claims that it was withdrawn in 1995!--&gt;, the [[American National Standards Institute]] adopted [[ANSI/ASME Y14.1]] which defined a regular series of paper sizes based upon the ''de facto'' standard {{convert|8+1/2|×|11|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} Letter size which it assigned "ANSI A", intended for technical drawings, hence sometimes labeled "Engineering". This series is somewhat similar to the ISO standard in that cutting a sheet in half would produce two sheets of the next smaller size and therefore also includes Ledger/Tabloid as "ANSI B". Unlike the ISO standard, however, the arbitrary base sides forces this series to have two alternating aspect ratios. For example, ANSI A is less elongated than A4, while ANSI B is more elongated than A3.

The Canadian standard CAN2-9.60-M76 and its successor CAN/CGSB-9.60-94 "Paper Sizes for Correspondence" specified paper sizes P1 through P6, which are the ANSI paper sizes rounded to the nearest 5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html |title= International standard paper sizes |accessdate=2008-03-06 |last=Kuhn |first=Markus }}&lt;/ref&gt; All custom Canadian paper size standards were withdrawn in 2012 and &lt;!--presumably--&gt; the respective ISO standards took their places.

Other, informal, larger sizes continuing the alphabetic series illustrated above exist, but they are not part of the series ''per se'', because they do not exhibit the same aspect ratios. For example, Engineering F size is {{convert|28|×|40|in|mm|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} with ca. 1.4286:1; it is commonly required for [[NAVFAC]] drawings, but is generally less commonly used. Engineering G size is {{convert|22+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} high, but it is a [[roll format]] with a variable width up to {{convert|90|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} in increments of {{convert|8+1/ 2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Engineering H through N sizes are also roll formats.

Such huge sheets were at one time used for full-scale layouts of aircraft parts, automotive parts, wiring harnesses and the like, but are slowly being phased out, due to widespread use of [[computer-aided design]] (CAD) and [[computer-aided manufacturing]] (CAM). Some visual arts fields also continue to use these paper formats for large-scale printouts, such as for displaying digitally painted character renderings at life-size as references for makeup artists and costume designers, or to provide an immersive landscape reference.

==== Architectural sizes ====

[[File:ARCH PAPER SIZES v3.svg|thumb|right|A size chart illustrating the Architectural sizes.]]
In addition to the system as listed above, there is a corresponding series of paper sizes used for [[architecture|architectural]] purposes defined in  the same standard, ANSI/ASME Y14.1, which is usually abbreviated "Arch". This series also shares the property that bisecting each size produces two of the size below, with alternating aspect ratios. It may be preferred by North American architects because the aspect ratios (4:3 and 3:2) are ratios of small integers, unlike their ANSI (or ISO) counterparts. Furthermore, the aspect ratio 4:3 matches the traditional aspect ratio for computer displays.

The size Arch E1 has a different aspect ratio because it derives from adding 6 inches to each side of Arch D or subtracting the same amount from Arch E. An intermediate size between Arch C and D with a long side of {{convert|30|in|mm}} does not exist.
&lt;!-- Someone please explain the weird E2 and E3 here! A reliable source would also be very much welcome.--&gt;

=== Notebook sizes ===

The sizes listed above are for paper sold loose in [[paper ream|ream]]s. There are many sizes of [[notebook|tablets of paper]], that is, sheets of paper bound at one edge, usually by a strip of plastic or hardened [[polyvinyl acetate|PVA adhesive]]. Often there is a pad of [[paperboard|cardboard]] (also known as [[Paperboard|chipboard]] or [[greyboard]]) at the bottom of the stack. Such a tablet serves as a portable writing surface, and the sheets often have lines printed on them, usually in [[Non-photo blue|non-repro blue]], to make writing in a line easier. An older means of binding is to have the sheets stapled to the cardboard along the top of the tablet; there is a line of perforated holes across every page just below the top edge from which any page may be torn off. Lastly, a pad of sheets each weakly stuck with adhesive to the sheet below, trademarked as "[[Post-It]]" or "Stick-Em" and available in various sizes, serve as a sort of tablet.

"Letter pads" are {{convert|8+1/2|by|11|in|mm|1}}, while the term "legal pad" is often used by laymen to refer to pads of various sizes including those of {{convert|8+1/2|by|14|in|mm|1}}. There are "steno pads" (used by [[stenography|stenographers]]) of {{convert|6|by|9|in|mm|1}}.

In countries where the ISO sizes are standard, most notebooks and tablets are sized to ISO specifications (for example, most newsagents in Australia stock A4 and A3 tablets).

=== Grain ===

Most industry standards express the direction of the [[Paper#Paper grain|grain]] last when giving dimensions (that is, 17&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;11 inches is short grain paper and 11&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;17 inches is long grain paper), although alternatively the grain alignment can be explicitly indicated with an underline (&lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;17 is short grain) or the letter "M" for "machine" (11M&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;17 is short grain). Grain is important because paper will crack if folded across the grain: for example, if a sheet 17&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;11 inches is to be folded to divide the sheet into two 8.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;11 halves, then the grain will be along the 11-inch side.&lt;ref name="xerox-grain"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.xerox.com/printer-supplies/paper-stock/paper-grain/enus.html
| title = Paper Grain &amp; Smoothness: Don't Go Against the Grain
| publisher = [[Xerox]] Corp.
| quote = A paper mill may indicate paper grain on carton and ream labels, product brochures, swatch books and price lists in several ways:&lt;br /&gt;1. You may see the words Grain Long or Grain Short.&lt;br /&gt;2. The dimension parallel to the grain may be underscored. For example, 8.5x&lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt; indicates long grain, while &lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt;x17 indicates short grain.&lt;br /&gt;3. "M" may be used to indicate machine direction, for example, 11Mx17 indicates short grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fold paper parallel to the grain direction. Paper folded against the grain may be rough and crack along the folded edge. The heavier the paper, the more likely roughness and cracking will occur.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper intended to be fed into a machine that will bend the paper around rollers, such as a [[printing press]], [[photocopier]] or [[typewriter]], should be fed grain side first so that the axis of the rollers is along the grain.
&lt;!-- This might explain the difference between Ledger and Tabloid. --&gt;

== Traditional inch-based paper sizes ==
&lt;!-- [[Foolscap]] links to this section --&gt;

[[File:Paper size - US system.svg|thumb|Traditional and standardized paper formats still relevant in the US]]
Traditionally, a number of different sizes were defined for large sheets of paper, and paper sizes were defined by the sheet name and the number of times it had been folded.  Thus a full sheet of "royal" paper was 25 × 20 inches, and "royal octavo" was this size folded three times, so as to make eight sheets, and was thus 10 × {{frac|6|1|4}} inches.

Many of these sizes were only used for making books (see [[bookbinding]]), and would never have been offered for ordinary stationery purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trussel.com/books/booksize.htm |title=Book sizes, with reference tables }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foolscap folio]] is often referred to simply as "folio" or "foolscap".  Similarly, "quarto" is more correctly "copy draught quarto" and "Kings" is an alias for "Foolscap quarto".

=== Demitab ===

The '''demitab''' or '''demi-tab''' (from the French "demi" or half tabloid) is {{convert|5+1/2|x|8+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, equal to one quarter of a sheet of {{convert |11|x|17|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[L size|tabloid]] size paper. In actual circulation, the size {{convert|8|x|10+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} is common for a demitab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://horizonpublications.ca/html/max_image_area.php |publisher=Horizon Publications |title=Max Image Area }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tabloid (newspaper format)#Tabloid-sized newspapers|Tabloid]] newspapers, which are "generally half the size of a broadsheet", also vary in size. To add to the lack of uniformity, [[broadsheet]]s also vary in size.

== Traditional French paper sizes ==

Before the adoption of the ISO standard system in 1967, France had its own paper size system. Some{{which|date=December 2016}} of these formats are still used today, and they are standardized by the [[Association française de normalisation|AFNOR]].&lt;ref&gt;Norme NF Q 02-000: Dimensions des papiers d’écriture et de certaines catégories de papiers d’impression.&lt;/ref&gt; Their names come from the [[watermark]]s that the papers were branded with when they were handcrafted, which is still the case for certain art papers. They also generally exist in double versions where the smallest measure is multiplied by two, or in quadruple versions where both measures have been doubled.

A transitional size called '''PA4''' ({{convert|210|×|280|mm|in|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), sometimes dubbed '''L4''', was proposed for inclusion into the ISO 216 standard in 1975. It has the height of Canadian P4 paper (215&amp;nbsp;mm&amp;nbsp;× 280&amp;nbsp;mm, about {{frac|8|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;× 11&amp;nbsp;in) and the width of international A4 paper ({{convert|210|×|297|mm|in|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}), i.e. it uses the smaller value among the two for each side. The table below, shows how this format can be generalized into an entire format series.

The PA formats did not end up in ISO 216, because the committee decided that the set of standardized paper formats should be kept to the minimum necessary.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} However, PA4 remains of practical use today. In [[landscape format|landscape]] orientation, it has the same 4:3 aspect ratio as the displays of traditional TV sets, some [[computer displays]] (e.g. [[iPad]]) and [[data projector]]s. PA4, with appropriate [[margin (typography)|margin]]s, is therefore a good choice as the format of presentation slides.

As a compromise between the two most popular paper sizes globally, PA4 is used today by many international [[magazine]]s, because it can be printed easily on equipment designed for either A4 or US Letter. That means it is not as much a paper size than a page format.

The size 210 mm × 280 mm was documented in the Canadian standard CAN2-200.2-M79 "Common Image Area for Paper Sizes P4 and A4"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scc.ca/en/standardsdb/standards/2464 CAN2-200.2-M79: "Common Image Area for Paper Sizes P4 and A4"] issued 1979-04-01, withdrawn 2012-03-01&lt;/ref&gt;.

A non-standard&lt;!--?--&gt; F4 paper size is common in Southeast Asia. It is a transitional size with the shorter side from ISO A4 (210&amp;nbsp;mm) and the longer side from British Foolscap (13 in, 330&amp;nbsp;mm) and is sometimes known as ''(metric) foolscap'' or ''folio'' as well.

In Indonesia and Philippines, F4 paper is 215&amp;nbsp;× 330&amp;nbsp;mm (8.5&amp;nbsp;× 13&amp;nbsp;in). In Indonesia it is sometimes called Folio, while in Philippines it is sometimes also called Long Bond.

A sheet of F4 can be cut from a sheet of SRA4 with very little wastage. The size is also smaller than its [[#Swedish extensions|Swedish equivalent]] SIS F4 at 239&amp;nbsp;mm × 338&amp;nbsp;mm.

=== A0a ===

Although the movement is towards the international standard metric paper sizes, on the way there from the traditional ones there has been at least one new size just a little larger than that used internationally.

British architects and industrial designers once used a size called "Antiquarian", {{convert|31|×|53|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, as listed [[#Traditional inch-based paper sizes|above]], but given in the ''New Metric Handbook'' (Tutt &amp; Adler 1981) as {{convert|813|×|1372|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} for board size. This is a little larger than ISO A0, 841&amp;nbsp;mm × 1189&amp;nbsp;mm. So for a short time, a size called '''A0a''' of {{convert|1000|×|1370|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} was used in Britain, which is actually just a slightly shorter version of ISO B0 at 1414&amp;nbsp;mm.

=== Pliego ===

The most common paper sizes used for commercial and industrial printing in Colombia&lt;!-- other South-American countries as well? --&gt; are based upon a size referred to as ''pliego'' that is ISO B1 (707&amp;nbsp;mm × 1000&amp;nbsp;mm) cut to full decimetres. Smaller sizes are derived by halving as usual and just get a vulgar fraction prefix: ''{{frac|2}} pliego'' and ''{{frac|4}} pliego''.

=== Drawing paper ===

ISO 5457 specifies drawing paper sizes with a trimmed size equal to the A series sizes from A4 upward. The untrimmed sizes are 3 to 4 cm larger and rounded to the nearest centimeter. A0 through A3 are used in landscape orientation, while A4 is used in portrait orientation. Designations for preprinted drawing paper include the base sizes and a suffix, either ''T'' for trimmed or ''U'' for untrimmed sheets.

In the context of [[percolation theory]], a percolation transition is characterized by a set of ''universal'' [[critical exponents]], which describe the [[fractal]] properties of the percolating 
medium at large scales and sufficiently close to the transition. The exponents are universal in 
the sense that they only depend on the type of percolation [[percolation theory#Different models|model]] and on the space dimension. They are expected to not depend on microscopic details such as the lattice structure, or whether site or bond percolation is considered. This article deals with the critical exponents of random percolation.

Percolating systems have a parameter &lt;math&gt;p\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which controls the occupancy of sites or bonds in the system.  At a critical value &lt;math&gt;p_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the mean cluster size goes to infinity and the percolation transition takes place.  As one approaches &lt;math&gt;p_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, various quantities either diverge or go to a constant value by a power law in &lt;math&gt;|p - p_c|\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and the exponent of that power law is the critical exponent.  While the exponent of that power law is generally the same on both sides of the threshold, the coefficient or "amplitude" is generally different, leading to a universal amplitude ratio.

== Description ==
Thermodynamic or configurational systems near a critical point or a continuous phase transition become [[fractal]], and the behavior of many quantities in such circumstances is described by universal [[critical exponents]].  [[Percolation theory]] is a particularly simple and fundamental model in statistical mechanics which has a critical point, and a great deal of work has been done in finding its critical exponents, both theoretically (limited to two dimensions) and numerically.

Critical exponents exist for a variety of observables, but most of them are linked to each other by exponent (or scaling) relations. Only a few of them are independent, and the choice of the fundamental exponents depends on the focus of the study at hand. One choice is the set &lt;math&gt;\{\sigma,\, \tau\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; motivated by the cluster size distribution, another choice is &lt;math&gt;\{d_\text{f},\, \nu\}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; motivated by the structure of the infinite cluster. So-called correction exponents extend these sets, they refer to higher orders of the asymptotic expansion around the critical point.

== Definitions of exponents ==

=== Self-similarity at the percolation threshold ===

Percolation clusters become self-similar precisely at the threshold density &lt;math&gt;p_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for sufficiently large length scales, entailing the following asymptotic power laws:

The '''fractal dimension''' &lt;math&gt;d_\text{f}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; relates how the mass of the incipient infinite cluster depends on the radius or another length measure, &lt;math&gt;M(L) \sim L^{d_\text{f}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;p=p_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and for large probe sizes, &lt;math&gt;L\to\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Other notation: magnetic exponent &lt;math&gt;y_t = D = d_f\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and co-dimension &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\sigma = d - d_f\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Fisher exponent''' &lt;math&gt;\tau\,\!&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the '''cluster-size distribution''' &lt;math&gt;n_s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, which is often determined in computer simulations. The latter counts the number of clusters with a given size (volume) &lt;math&gt;s\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, normalized by the total volume (number of lattice sites). The distribution obeys a power law at the threshold, &lt;math&gt;n_s \sim s^{-\tau}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically as &lt;math&gt;s\to\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The probability for two sites separated by a distance &lt;math&gt;\vec r\,\!&lt;/math&gt; to belong to the same cluster decays as &lt;math&gt;g(\vec r)\sim |\vec r|^{-2(d-d_\text{f})}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;g(\vec r)\sim |\vec r|^{-d+(2-\eta)}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for large distances, which introduces the '''[[anomalous dimension]]''' &lt;math&gt;\eta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Also, &lt;math&gt; \delta = (d + 2 - \eta)/(d - 2 + \eta)&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; \eta = 2 - \gamma/\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

The exponent &lt;math&gt;\Omega\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is connected with the leading '''correction to scaling''', which appears, e.g., in the asymptotic expansion of the cluster-size distribution,
&lt;math&gt;n_s \sim s^{-\tau}(1+\text{const} \times s^{-\Omega})\,\!&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;s\to\infty\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Also, &lt;math&gt; \omega = \Omega/(\sigma \nu) = \Omega d_f&lt;/math&gt;.

For quantities like the mean cluster size &lt;math&gt; S \sim a_0 |p - p_c|^{-\gamma} (1 + a_1 (p - p_c)^{\Delta_1} +\ldots )&lt;/math&gt;, the corrections are controlled by the exponent &lt;math&gt; \Delta_1 = \Omega\beta\delta = \omega \nu&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="AdlerMoshePrivman83"/&gt;

The '''minimum''' or '''chemical distance''' or '''shortest-path''' exponent  &lt;math&gt;d_\mathrm{min}&lt;/math&gt; describes how the average minimum distance  &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell \rangle &lt;/math&gt; relates to the Euclidean distance  &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, namely  &lt;math&gt;\langle \ell \rangle \sim r^{d_\mathrm{min}}&lt;/math&gt; .  The '''elastic backbone''' &lt;ref name="HerrmannHongStanley84"/&gt; has the same fractal dimension as the shortest path.  A related quantity is the '''spreading dimension''' &lt;math&gt;d_\ell&lt;/math&gt;, which describes the scaling of the mass M of a critical cluster within a chemical distance  &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; as  &lt;math&gt;M \sim \ell^{d_\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, and is related to the fractal dimension &lt;math&gt;d_f&lt;/math&gt; of the cluster by  &lt;math&gt;d_\ell = d_f/d_\mathrm{min}&lt;/math&gt;.  The chemical distance can also be thought of as a time in an epidemic growth process, and one also defines &lt;math&gt; \nu_t &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; d_\mathrm{min}  = \nu_t/\nu = 1/z  &lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;z &lt;/math&gt; is the '''dynamical exponent'''.&lt;ref name="Grassberger92"/&gt;  One also writes  &lt;math&gt; \nu_\parallel = \nu_t &lt;/math&gt;.

Also related to the minimum dimension is the simultaneous growth of two nearby clusters.  The probability that the two clusters coalesce exactly in time &lt;math&gt; t &lt;/math&gt; scales as &lt;math&gt; p(t) \sim  t^{-\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Grassberger99"/&gt;  with  &lt;math&gt; \lambda = 1 + 5/(4 d_\mathrm{min})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ziff99"&gt;{{cite journal

The dimension of the '''backbone''', which is defined as the subset of cluster sites
carrying the current when a voltage difference is applied between two sites far apart,  is &lt;math&gt;d_\text{b}&lt;/math&gt; (or  &lt;math&gt;d_\text{BB}&lt;/math&gt;).

The [[fractal dimension]] of the '''random walk''' on an infinite incipient percolation cluster is given by &lt;math&gt;d_w&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''spectral dimension''' &lt;math&gt;\tilde d&lt;/math&gt; such that the average number of distinct sites visited in an  &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;-step random walk scales as  &lt;math&gt;N^{\tilde d}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Critical behavior close to the percolation threshold ===

The approach to the percolation threshold is governed by power laws again, which hold asymptotically close to &lt;math&gt;p_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt;:

The exponent &lt;math&gt;\nu\,\!&lt;/math&gt; describes the divergence of the '''correlation length''' &lt;math&gt;\xi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; as the percolation transition is approached, &lt;math&gt;\xi \sim |p-p_c|^{-\nu}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The infinite cluster becomes homogeneous at length scales beyond the correlation length; further, it is a measure for the linear extent of the largest finite cluster.  Other notation: Thermal exponent &lt;math&gt; y_t = 1/\nu&lt;/math&gt; and  dimension &lt;math&gt; \Delta_\epsilon = d - 1/\nu &lt;/math&gt;.

Off criticality, only finite clusters exist up to a '''largest cluster size''' &lt;math&gt;s_\max\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, and the cluster-size distribution is smoothly cut off by a rapidly decaying function, &lt;math&gt;n_s \sim s^{-\tau} f(s/s_\max)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The exponent &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the divergence of the cutoff parameter, &lt;math&gt;s_\max \sim |p-p_c|^{-1/\sigma}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. From the [[fractal]] relation we have &lt;math&gt;s_\max \sim \xi^{d_\text{f}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, yielding &lt;math&gt;\sigma = 1/\nu d_\text{f}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''density of clusters''' (number of clusters per site) &lt;math&gt;n_c&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at the threshold but its third derivative goes to infinity as determined by the exponent &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:  &lt;math&gt;n_c \sim A + B (p - p_c) + C (p - p_c)^2 + D_\pm |p - p_c|^{2 - \alpha} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;D_\pm &lt;/math&gt; represents the coefficient above and below the transition point.

The '''strength''' or '''weight of the percolating cluster''', &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;P_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, is the probability that a site belongs to an infinite cluster. &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is zero below the transition and is non-analytic. Just above the transition, &lt;math&gt;P\sim |p-p_c|^\beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, defining the exponent &lt;math&gt;\beta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\ P&lt;/math&gt; plays the role of an [[Phase transition#Order parameters|order parameter]].

The divergence of the '''mean cluster size''' &lt;math&gt;S=\sum_s s^2 n_s/p_c \sim |p-p_c|^{-\gamma}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; introduces the exponent &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''conductivity''' exponent &lt;math&gt; t = t'/\nu &lt;/math&gt;  describes how the electrical conductivity &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; goes to zero in a conductor-insulator mixture, &lt;math&gt;C\sim |p-p_c|^t\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  Also,  &lt;math&gt; t' = \zeta  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Surface critical exponents ===

The probability a point at a surface belongs to the percolating or infinite cluster is &lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm{surf}\sim |p-p_c|^{\beta_\mathrm{surf}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The surface fractal dimension is given by &lt;math&gt;d_\mathrm{surf} = d - 1 -\beta_\mathrm{surf}/\nu &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="StaufferAharony99"&gt;{{cite journal

Note that it has been claimed that the numerical values of exponents of percolation depends only on the dimension of lattice. However, percolation on WPSL is an exception in the sense that albeit it is two dimensional yet it does not belong to the same universality where all the planar lattices belong.&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan and M. M. Rahman, “Percolation on a multifractal scale-free planar stochastic lattice and its universality class” Phys. Rev. E (Rapid Communication) '''92''' 040101(R) (2015) https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.040101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. K. Hassan and M. M.

== Exponents for directed percolation ==

Directed percolation (DP) refers to percolation in which the fluid can flow only in one direction along bonds—such as only in the downward direction on a square lattice rotated by 45 degrees.  This system is referred to as "1 + 1 dimensional DP" where the two dimensions are thought of as space and time.

&lt;math&gt;\nu_\perp &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_\parallel &lt;/math&gt; are the transverse (perpendicular) and longitudinal (parallel) correlation length exponents, respectively. Also &lt;math&gt;\zeta = 1/z = \nu_\perp / \nu_\parallel &lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; is the exponent corresponding to the behavior of the survival probability as a function of time: &lt;math&gt; P(t) \sim t^{-\delta} &lt;/math&gt;.

The d(space)+1(time) dimensional exponents are given below.

In [[graph theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''periodic graph''' with respect to an operator ''F'' on graphs is one for which there exists an integer ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that ''F&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;''(''G'') is [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Zelinka | first = B. | title = Periodicity of graph operators | journal = Discrete Mathematics | volume = 235 | pages = 349–351 | year = 2001 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V00-433PBV1-16&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=05%2F28%2F2001&amp;_rdoc=34&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=browse&amp;_srch=doc-info(%23toc%235632%232001%23997649998%23251347%23FLT%23display%23Volume)&amp;_cdi=5632&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;_ct=39&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=c91abbf2a679877d22212fa49932088c | accessdate = 14 August 2010 | doi=10.1016/s0012-365x(00)00288-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, every graph is periodic with respect to the [[complement graph|complementation operator]], whereas only [[complete graph]]s are periodic with respect to the operator that assigns to each graph the complete graph on the same vertices.  Periodicity is one of many properties of graph operators, the central topic in '''graph dynamics'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Prisner | first = Erich | title = Graph Dynamics | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-0-582-28696-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13650">In [[mathematics]], the '''Poisson boundary''' is a [[Measure (mathematics)|measure space]] associated to a [[random walk]]. It is an object designed to encode the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] behaviour of the random walk, i.e. how trajectories diverge when the number of steps goes to infinity. Despite being called a boundary it is in general a purely measure-theoretical object and not a [[Compactification (mathematics)|boundary in the topological sense]]. However, in the case where the random walk is on a topological space the Poisson boundary can be related to the '''[[Martin boundary]]''' which is an analytic construction yielding a genuine topological boundary. Both boundaries are related to [[harmonic function]]s on the space via generalisations of the [[Poisson kernel|Poisson formula]].

== The case of the hyperbolic plane ==

The Poisson formula states that given a positive harmonic function  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on the [[unit disc]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb D = \{ z \in \mathbb C : |z| &lt; 1\}&lt;/math&gt; (that is, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f = 0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator]] associated to the [[Poincaré metric]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb D&lt;/math&gt;) there exists a unique measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathbb D = \{ z \in \mathbb C : |z| = 1\}&lt;/math&gt; such that the equality 
:&lt;math&gt; f(z) = \int_{\partial \mathbb D} K(z, \xi) \, d\mu(\xi) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;K(z, \xi) = \frac {1 - |z|^2}{|\xi - z|^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''Poisson kernel'', 
holds for all &lt;math&gt;z \in \mathbb D&lt;/math&gt;. One way to interpret this is that the functions &lt;math&gt;K(\cdot, \xi)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\xi \in \partial \mathbb D&lt;/math&gt; are up to scaling all the [[extreme point]]s in the cone of nonnegative harmonic functions. This analytical interpretation of the set &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathbb D&lt;/math&gt; leads to the more general notion of ''minimal Martin boundary'' (which in this case is the full ''Martin boundary'').

This fact can also be interpreted in a probabilistic manner. If &lt;math&gt;W_t&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Markov process]] associated to &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. the [[Brownian motion]] on the disc with the Poincaré Riemannian metric), then the process &lt;math&gt;f(W_t)&lt;/math&gt; is a continuous-time [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]], and as such converges almost everywhere to a function on the [[Wiener space]] of possible (infinite) trajectories for &lt;math&gt;W_t&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the Poisson formula identifies this measured space with the Martin boundary constructed above, and ultimately to &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathbb D&lt;/math&gt; endowed with the class of Lebesgue measure (note that this identification can be made directly since a path in Wiener space converges almost surely to a point on &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathbb D&lt;/math&gt;). This interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\partial \mathbb D&lt;/math&gt; as the space of trajectories for a Markov process is a special case of the construction of the Poisson boundary.

Finally, the constructions above can be discretised, i.e. restricted to the random walks on the orbits of a [[Fuchsian group]] acting on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb D&lt;/math&gt;. This gives an identification of the extremal positive harmonic functions on the group, and to the space of trajectories of the random walk on the group (both with respect to a given probability measure), with the topological/measured space &lt;math&gt;\mathbb D&lt;/math&gt;.

== Definition ==

=== The Poisson boundary of a random walk on a discrete group ===

Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a discrete group and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; a probability measure on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, which will be used to define a random walk &lt;math&gt;X_t&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (a discrete-time Markov process whose transition probabilities are &lt;math&gt;p(x, y) = \mu(xy^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;); the measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''step distribution'' for the random walk. Let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; be another measure on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, which will be the initial state for the random walk. The space &lt;math&gt;G^{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; of trajectories for &lt;math&gt;X_t&lt;/math&gt; is endowed with the measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P_m = m*\mu^{*\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[convolution]] of measures). There is also an [[equivalence relation]] &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G^{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, which identifies &lt;math&gt;(x_t)&lt;/matH&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(y_t)&lt;/math&gt; if there exists &lt;math&gt;n, m \in \mathbb N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x_{t+n} = y_{t+m}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t \ge 0&lt;/math&gt; (the two trajectories have the same "tail"). The ''Poisson boundary'' of &lt;math&gt;(G, \mu)&lt;/math&gt; is then the measured space &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; obtained as the quotient of &lt;math&gt;(G^{\mathbb N}, \mathbb P_m)&lt;/math&gt; by the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Kaimanovich|1996}}

If &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the initial distribution of a random walk with step distribution &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; then the measure &lt;math&gt;\nu_\theta&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; obtained as the pushforward of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb P_\theta&lt;/math&gt;. It is a stationary measure for &lt;math&gt;(G, \mu)&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that 
:&lt;math&gt;\int_G \nu(g^{-1}A) \mu(g) = \nu_\theta(A).&lt;/math&gt;
It is possible to give an implicit definition of the Poisson boundary as the maximal &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set with a &lt;math&gt;(G, \mu)&lt;/math&gt;-stationary measure &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the additional condition that &lt;math&gt;(X_t)_*\nu&lt;/math&gt; almost surely [[Convergence of measures|weakly converges]] to a [[Dirac mass]].{{sfn|Kaimanovich|1996|loc=Section 2.7}}

=== The Poisson formula ===

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-harmonic function on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{h\in G} f(hg)\mu(h) = f(g)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the random variable &lt;math&gt;f(X_t)&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete-time martingale and so it converges almost surely. Denote by &lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt; the function on &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; obtained by taking the limit of the values of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; along a trajectory (this is defined almost everywhere on &lt;math&gt;G^{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; and shift-invariant). Let &lt;math&gt;x \in G&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\nu_x&lt;/math&gt; be the measure obtained by the constriction above with &lt;math&gt;\theta = \delta_x&lt;/math&gt; (the Dirac mass at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;). If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is either positive or bounded then &lt;math&gt;\hat f&lt;/math&gt; is as well and we have the ''Poisson formula'':
: &lt;math&gt; f(x) = \int_\Gamma \hat f(\gamma) \, d\nu_x(\gamma). &lt;/math&gt;
This establishes a bijection between &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-harmonic bounded functions and essentially bounded measurable functions on &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. In particular the Poisson boundary of &lt;math&gt;(G, \mu)&lt;/math&gt; is trivial, that is reduced to a point, if and only if the only bounded &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;-harmonic functions on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; are constant.

=== General definition ===

The general setting is that of a ''Markov operator'' on a measured space, a notion which generalises the Markov operator &lt;math&gt;f \mapsto \mu*f&lt;/math&gt; associated to a random walk. Much of the theory can be developed in this abstract and very general setting.

== The Martin boundary ==

=== Martin boundary of a discrete group ===

Let &lt;math&gt;G, \mu&lt;/math&gt; be a random walk on a discrete group. Let &lt;math&gt;p_n(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; be the probability to get from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; steps, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\mu^{*n}(x^{-1}y)&lt;/math&gt;. The Green kernel is by definition:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal G(x, y) = \sum_{n \ge 1} p_n(x, y).&lt;/math&gt; 
If the walk is transient then this series is convergent for all &lt;math&gt;x, y&lt;/math&gt;. Fix a point &lt;math&gt;o \in G&lt;/math&gt; and define the Martin kernel by: 
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal K_o(x, y) = \frac{\mathcal G(x, y)}{\mathcal G(o, y)}&lt;/math&gt;. 
The embedding &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \mathcal K_o( \cdot, y)&lt;/math&gt; has a relatively compact image for the topology of pointwise convergence, and the Martin compactification is the closure of this image. A point &lt;math&gt;\gamma \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is usually represented by the notation &lt;math&gt;\mathcal K(\cdot, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt;.

The Martin kernels are positive harmonic functions and every positive harmonic function can be expressed as an integral of functions on the boundary, that is for every positive harmonic function there is a measure &lt;math&gt;\nu_{o, f}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; such that a Poisson-like formula holds:
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = \int \mathcal K_o(x, \gamma) \, d\nu_{o, f}(\gamma).&lt;/math&gt;
The measures &lt;math&gt;\nu_{o, f}&lt;/math&gt; are supported on the ''minimal Martin boundary, whose elements can also be characterised by being minimal. A positive harmonic function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''minimal'' if for any harmonic function &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; 0 \le v \le u&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;c \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;v = cu&lt;/math&gt;.{{sfn|Kaimanovich|1996|loc=Section 1.2}}

There is actually a whole family of Martin compactifications. Define the Green generating series as
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal  G_r(x, y) = \sum_{n \ge 1} p_n(x, y)r^n.&lt;/math&gt;
Denote by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; the radius of convergence of this power series
and define for &lt;math&gt;1\leq r \leq R&lt;/math&gt; the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-Martin kernel by
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal K_{o,r}(x, y) = \frac{\mathcal G_r(x, y)}{\mathcal G_r(o, y)}&lt;/math&gt;.
The closure of the embedding &lt;math&gt;y \mapsto \mathcal K_{o,r}( \cdot, y)&lt;/math&gt; is called the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;-Martin compactification.

=== Martin boundary of a Riemannian manifold ===

For a Riemannian manifold the Martin boundary is constructed, when it exists, in the same way as above, using the [[Green's function|Green function]] of the Laplace–Beltrami operator &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt;. In this case there is again a whole family of Martin compactifications associated to the operators &lt;math&gt;\Delta + \lambda&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;0\le \lambda \le \lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\lambda_0&lt;/math&gt; is the bottom of the spectrum. Examples where this construction can be used to define a compactification are bounded domains in the plane and [[symmetric space]]s of non-compact type.{{sfn|Guivarc'h|Ji|Taylor|loc=Chapter VI}}

=== The relationship between Martin and Poisson boundaries ===

The measure &lt;math&gt;\nu_{o, 1}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the constant function is called the ''harmonic measure'' on the Martin boundary. With this measure the Martin boundary is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary.

== Examples ==

=== Nilpotent groups ===

The Poisson and Martin boundaries are trivial for symmetric random walks in nilpotent groups.{{sfn|Kaimanovich|1996|loc=Section 1.5}} On the other hand, when the random walk is non-centered, the study of the full Martin boundary, including the minimal functions, is far less conclusive.

=== Lie groups and discrete subgroups ===

For random walks on a semisimple Lie group (with step distribution absolutely continuous with respect to the Haar measure) the Poisson boundary is equal to the [[Furstenberg boundary]].{{sfn|Kaimanovich|1996|loc=Section 2.8}} The Poisson boundary of the Brownian motion on the associated symmetric space is also the Furstenberg boundary.{{sfn|Furstenberg|1963}} The full Martin boundary is also well-studied in these cases and can always be described in a geometric manner. For example, for groups of rank one (for example the isometry groups of [[hyperbolic space]]s) the full Martin boundary is the same as the minimal Martin boundary (the situation in higher-rank groups is more complicated).{{sfn|Guivarc'h|Ji|Taylor|1998}}

The Poisson boundary of a [[Zariski topology|Zariski-dense]] subgroup of a semisimple Lie group, for example a [[Lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]], is also equal to the Furstenberg boundary of the group.{{sfn|Kaimanovich|2000|loc=Theorem 10.7}}

=== Hyperbolic groups ===

For random walks on an [[hyperbolic group]], under rather weak assumptions on the step distribution which always hold for a simple walk (a more general condition is that the first moment be finite) the Poisson boundary is always equal to the Gromov boundary. For example, the Poisson boundary of a free group is the space of [[end (graph theory)|ends]] of its Cayley tree.{{sfn|Kaimanovich|2000|loc=Theorem 7.4}} The identification of the full Martin boundary is more involved; in case the random walk has finite range (the step distribution is supported on a finite set) the Martin boundary coincides with the minimal Martin boundary and both coincide with the Gromov boundary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1532">'''Preferential entailment''' is a [[non-monotonic logic]] based on selecting only [[model (logic)|model]]s that are considered the most plausible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">In [[theoretical computer science]], '''probabilistic bisimulation''' is an extension of the concept of [[bisimulation]] for fully probabilistic [[state transition system|transition systems]] first described by [[K.G. Larsen]] and [[A. Skou]].&lt;ref&gt;K. G. Larsen and A. Skou and appeared in the article ''Bisimulation through Probabilistic Testing'', published in Information and Computation, vol 94, pages 1-28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

A discrete probabilistic transition system is a triple

: &lt;math&gt;S = (\operatorname{St}, \operatorname{Act}, \tau:\operatorname{St} \times \operatorname{Act}\times \operatorname{St}\rightarrow [0,1])&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau(s,a,t)&lt;/math&gt; gives the probability of starting in the state ''s'', performing the action ''a'' and ending up in the state ''t''.  The set of states is assumed to be countable.  There is no attempt to assign probabilities to actions.  It is assumed that the actions are chosen nondeterministically by an adversary or by the environment.  This type of system is fully probabilistic, there is no other indeterminacy.

The definition of a probabilistic bisimulation on a system ''S'' is an equivalence relation ''R'' on the state space St, such that for every pair ''s'',''t'' in St with sRt and for every action a in Act and for every equivalence class ''C'' of ''R''
&lt;math&gt;\tau(s,a,C) = \tau(t,a,C).&lt;/math&gt;  Two states are said to be probabilistically bisimilar if there is some such ''R'' relating them.

When applied to [[Markov chains]], probabilistic bisimulation is the same concept as [[lumpability]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx5/8606/27273/01212701.pdf?arnumber=1212701 Probabilistic Noninterference through Weak Probabilistic Bisimulation] by Geoffrey Smith Proceedings of the 16th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Workshop (CSFW’03) 1063-6900/03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3733">In [[computability theory]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[natural number]]s is called '''recursive''', '''computable''' or '''decidable''' if there is an [[algorithm]] which takes a number as input, terminates after a finite amount of time (possibly depending on the given number) and correctly decides whether the number belongs to the set.

A more general class of sets consists of the [[recursively enumerable set]]s, also called '''semidecidable''' sets.  For these sets, it is only required that there is an algorithm that correctly decides when a number ''is'' in the set; the algorithm may give no answer (but not the wrong answer) for numbers not in the set.

A set which is not computable is called '''noncomputable''' or '''undecidable'''.

==Formal definition==

A subset {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}} of the [[natural number]]s is called '''recursive''' if there exists a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] {{math|''f'' }} such that 
{{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 1 }} if {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; &amp;isin; &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; }} and {{math|''f''(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;) {{=}} 0 }} if {{math|&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; &amp;notin; &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; }}.  In other words, the set {{math|&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;}} is recursive [[if and only if]] the [[indicator function]] {{math|1&lt;sub&gt;&lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[computable function|computable]].

==Examples==

*Every finite or [[cofinite]] subset of the natural numbers is computable. This includes these special cases:
**The [[empty set]] is computable.
**The entire set of natural numbers is computable.
**Each natural number ([[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers#The contemporary standard|as defined in standard set theory]]) is computable; that is, the set of natural numbers less than a given natural number is computable.
*The set of [[prime number]]s is computable.
*A [[recursive language]] is a recursive subset of a [[formal language]].
*The set of Gödel numbers of arithmetic proofs described in Kurt Gödel's paper "On formally undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and related systems I" is computable; see [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

==Properties==

If ''A'' is a recursive set then the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' is a recursive set. If ''A'' and ''B'' are recursive sets then ''A'' ∩ ''B'', ''A'' ∪ ''B'' and the image of ''A'' &amp;times; ''B'' under the [[Cantor pairing function]] are recursive sets.

A set ''A'' is a recursive set [[if and only if]] ''A'' and the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''A'' are both [[recursively enumerable set]]s. The [[preimage]] of a recursive set under a [[total function|total]] [[computable function]] is a recursive set. The image of a computable set under a total computable [[bijection]] is computable.

A set is recursive if and only if it is at level {{math| &amp;Delta;{{su|p=0|b=1}} }} of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].

A set is recursive if and only if it is either the range of a nondecreasing total computable function or the empty set. The image of a computable set under a nondecreasing total computable function is computable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9067">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[ring theory]], the '''simple modules''' over a ring ''R'' are the (left or right) [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over ''R'' that have no non-zero proper submodules.  Equivalently, a module ''M'' is simple [[if and only if]] every [[cyclic module|cyclic submodule]] generated by a non-zero element of ''M'' equals ''M''.  Simple modules form building blocks for the modules of finite [[length of a module|length]], and they are analogous to the [[simple group]]s in group theory.

In this article, all modules will be assumed to be right [[unital module]]s over a ring ''R''.

== Examples ==
'''[[Integer|Z]]'''-modules are the same as abelian groups, so a simple '''Z'''-module is an abelian group which has no non-zero proper subgroups.  These are the [[cyclic group]]s of [[prime number|prime]] [[order (group theory)|order]].

If ''I'' is a right ideal of ''R'', then ''I'' is simple as a right module if and only if ''I'' is a minimal non-zero right ideal: If ''M'' is a non-zero proper submodule of ''I'', then it is also a right ideal, so ''I'' is not minimal.  Conversely, if ''I'' is not minimal, then there is a non-zero right ideal ''J'' properly contained in ''I''.  ''J'' is a right submodule of ''I'', so ''I'' is not simple.

If ''I'' is a right ideal of ''R'', then ''R''/''I'' is simple if and only if ''I'' is a maximal right ideal: If ''M'' is a non-zero proper submodule of ''R''/''I'', then the preimage of ''M'' under the quotient map {{nowrap|''R'' &amp;rarr; ''R''/''I''}} is a right ideal which is not equal to ''R'' and which properly contains ''I''.  Therefore, ''I'' is not maximal.  Conversely, if ''I'' is not maximal, then there is a right ideal ''J'' properly containing ''I''.  The quotient map {{nowrap|''R''/''I'' &amp;rarr; ''R''/''J''}} has a non-zero kernel which is not equal to {{nowrap|''R''/''I''}}, and therefore {{nowrap|''R''/''I''}} is not simple.

Every simple ''R''-module is isomorphic to a quotient ''R''/''m'' where ''m'' is a [[maximal ideal|maximal right ideal]] of ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;Herstein, ''Non-commutative Ring Theory'', Lemma 1.1.3&lt;/ref&gt;  By the above paragraph, any quotient ''R''/''m'' is a simple module.  Conversely, suppose that ''M'' is a simple ''R''-module.  Then, for any non-zero element ''x'' of ''M'', the cyclic submodule ''xR'' must equal ''M''.  Fix such an ''x''.  The statement that {{nowrap begin}}''xR'' = ''M''{{nowrap end}} is equivalent to the surjectivity of the homomorphism {{nowrap|''R'' &amp;rarr; ''M''}} that sends ''r'' to ''xr''.  The kernel of this homomorphism is a right ideal ''I'' of ''R'', and a standard theorem states that ''M'' is isomorphic to ''R''/''I''.  By the above paragraph, we find that ''I'' is a maximal right ideal.  Therefore, ''M'' is isomorphic to a quotient of ''R'' by a maximal right ideal.

If ''k'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] and ''G'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]], then a [[group representation]] of ''G'' is a [[left module]] over the [[group ring]] ''k[G]'' (for details, see the [[Representation theory of finite groups#Representations.2C modules and the convolution algebra|main page on this relationship]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2202385|title=Linear Representations of Finite Groups|last=Serre|first=Jean-Pierre|date=|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1977|isbn=0387901906|series=|location=New York|pages=47|issn=0072-5285|oclc=2202385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple ''k[G]'' modules are also known as '''irreducible''' representations. A major aim of [[representation theory]] is to understand the irreducible representations of groups.

== Basic properties of simple modules ==
The simple modules are precisely the modules of [[length of a module|length]] 1; this is a reformulation of the definition.

Every simple module is [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]], but the converse is in general not true.

Every simple module is [[cyclic module|cyclic]], that is it is generated by one element.

Not every module has a simple submodule; consider for instance the '''Z'''-module '''Z''' in light of the first example above.

Let ''M'' and ''N'' be (left or right) modules over the same ring, and let {{nowrap begin}}''f'' : ''M'' → ''N''{{nowrap end}} be a [[module homomorphism]]. If ''M'' is simple, then ''f'' is either the zero homomorphism or [[injective]] because the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of ''f'' is a submodule of ''M''. If ''N'' is simple, then ''f'' is either the zero homomorphism or [[surjective]] because the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f'' is a submodule of ''N''. If {{nowrap begin}}''M'' = ''N''{{nowrap end}}, then ''f'' is an [[endomorphism]] of ''M'', and if ''M'' is simple, then the prior two statements imply that ''f'' is either the zero homomorphism or an isomorphism. Consequently, the [[endomorphism ring]] of any simple module is a [[division ring]]. This result is known as '''[[Schur's lemma]]'''.

The converse of Schur's lemma is not true in general. For example, the '''Z'''-module '''[[rational number|Q]]''' is not simple, but its endomorphism ring is isomorphic to the field '''Q'''.

== Simple modules and composition series ==
{{main|Composition series}}
If ''M'' is a module which has a non-zero proper submodule ''N'', then there is a [[short exact sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to N \to M \to M/N \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
A common approach to proving a fact about ''M'' is to show that the fact is true for the center term of a short exact sequence when it is true for the left and right terms, then to prove the fact for ''N'' and ''M''/''N''.  If ''N'' has a non-zero proper submodule, then this process can be repeated.  This produces a chain of submodules
:&lt;math&gt;\cdots \subset M_2 \subset M_1 \subset M.&lt;/math&gt;
In order to prove the fact this way, one needs conditions on this sequence and on the modules ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;.  One particularly useful condition is that the [[length of a module|length]] of the sequence is finite and each quotient module ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;/''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; is simple.  In this case the sequence is called a '''composition series''' for ''M''.  In order to prove a statement inductively using composition series, the statement is first proved for simple modules, which form the base case of the induction, and then the statement is proved to remain true under an extension of a module by a simple module.  For example, the [[Fitting lemma]] shows that the [[endomorphism ring]] of a finite length [[indecomposable module]] is a [[local ring]], so that the strong [[Krull-Schmidt theorem]] holds and the category of finite length modules is a [[Krull-Schmidt category]].

The [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] and the [[Schreier refinement theorem]] describe the relationships amongst all composition series of a single module.  The [[Grothendieck group]] ignores the order in a composition series and views every finite length module as a formal sum of simple modules.  Over [[semisimple ring]]s, this is no loss as every module is a [[semisimple module]] and so a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of simple modules.  [[Ordinary character theory]] provides better arithmetic control, and uses simple '''C'''''G'' modules to understand the structure of [[finite group]]s ''G''.  [[Modular representation theory]] uses [[Brauer character]]s to view modules as formal sums of simple modules, but is also interested in how those simple modules are joined together within composition series.  This is formalized by studying the [[Ext functor]] and describing the module category in various ways including [[quiver (mathematics)|quivers]] (whose nodes are the simple modules and whose edges are composition series of non-semisimple modules of length 2) and [[Auslander–Reiten theory]] where the associated graph has a vertex for every indecomposable module.

== The Jacobson density theorem ==
{{main|Jacobson density theorem}}
An important advance in the theory of simple modules was the [[Jacobson density theorem]]. The Jacobson density theorem states:
:Let U be a simple right R-module and write D = End&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;(U). Let A be any D-linear operator on U and let X be a finite D-linearly independent subset of U. Then there exists an element r of R such that x&amp;middot;A = x&amp;middot;r for all x in X.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacs, Theorem 13.14, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;
In particular, any [[primitive ring]] may be viewed as (that is, isomorphic to) a ring of ''D''-linear operators on some ''D''-space.

A consequence of the Jacobson density theorem is Wedderburn's theorem; namely that any right [[artinian ring|artinian]] [[simple ring]] is isomorphic to a full matrix ring of ''n'' by ''n'' matrices over a [[division ring]] for some ''n''. This can also be established as a corollary of the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4141">[[File:Couronne solide.svg|thumb|The '''spherinder''' can be seen as the volume between two parallel and equal solid 2-[[sphere]]s (3-balls) in 4-dimensional space, here stereographically projected into 3D.]]
In [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional geometry]], the '''spherinder''', or '''spherical cylinder''' or '''spherical prism''', is a geometric object, defined as the [[Cartesian product]] of a 3-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]] (or solid 2-[[sphere]]), radius ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a [[line segment]] of length 2''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \{ (x,y,z,w) | x^2+y^2+z^2\leq r_1^2,\ w^2\leq r_2^2 \}&lt;/math&gt;

Like the [[duocylinder]], it is also analogous to a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] in 3-space, which is the Cartesian product of a disk with a [[line segment]].

It can be seen in 3-dimensional space by [[stereographic projection]] as two concentric spheres, in a similar way that a [[tesseract]] (cubic prism) can be projected as two concentric cubes.

==Relation to other shapes==

In 3-space, a cylinder can be considered intermediate between a [[cube]] and a [[sphere]].  In 4-space there are three intermediate forms between the [[tesseract]] and the [[hypersphere]].  Altogether, they are the:
*[[tesseract]] (1-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]] × 1-ball × 1-ball × 1-ball), whose hypersurface is eight [[cube]]s connected at 24 [[square]]s
*[[cubinder]] (2-ball × 1-ball × 1-ball)
*spherinder (3-ball × 1-ball), whose hypersurface is two 3-balls and a tube-like cell connected at the respective bounding spheres of the 3-balls
*[[duocylinder]] (2-ball × 2-ball)
*[[hypersphere]] (4-[[ball (mathematics)|ball]]), whose hypersurface is a [[3-sphere]] without any connecting boundaries.

These constructions correspond to the five [[Partition (number theory)|partition]]s of 4, the number of dimensions.

If the two ends of a spherinder are connected together, or equivalently if a sphere is dragged around a circle perpendicular to its 3-space, it traces out a [[spheritorus]].

== Related 4-polytopes ==
[[File:Truncated icosidodecahedral prism.png|thumb|The related [[truncated icosidodecahedral prism]] is constructed from two [[truncated icosidodecahedron|truncated icosidodecahedra]] connected by [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], shown here in [[stereographic projection]] with some prisms hidden.]]
The spherinder is related to the [[Uniform polychoron#Prismatic uniform polychora|uniform prismatic polychora]], which are [[cartesian product]] of a regular or semiregular [[polyhedron]] and a [[line segment]]. There are eighteen convex uniform prisms based on the [[Platonic solid|Platonic]] and [[Archimedean solid]]s ([[tetrahedral prism]], [[truncated tetrahedral prism]], [[cubic prism]], [[cuboctahedral prism]], [[octahedral prism]], [[rhombicuboctahedral prism]], [[truncated cubic prism]], [[truncated octahedral prism]], [[truncated cuboctahedral prism]], [[snub cubic prism]], [[dodecahedral prism]], [[icosidodecahedral prism]], [[icosahedral prism]], [[truncated dodecahedral prism]], [[rhombicosidodecahedral prism]], [[truncated icosahedral prism]], [[truncated icosidodecahedral prism]], [[snub dodecahedral prism]]), plus an infinite family based on [[antiprism]]s, and another infinite family of uniform [[duoprism]]s, which are products of two [[regular polygon]]s.

'''Systems Tool Kit''' (formerly '''Satellite Tool Kit'''), often referred to by its initials '''STK''', is a physics-based [[software]] package from [[Analytical Graphics, Inc.]] that allows engineers and scientists to perform complex analyses of ground, sea, air, and space assets, and share results in one integrated solution. At the core of STK is a geometry engine for determining the time-dynamic position and attitude of objects ("assets"), and the spatial relationships among the objects under consideration including their relationships or accesses given a number of complex, simultaneous constraining conditions. STK has been developed since 1989 as a commercial off the shelf software tool. Originally created to solve problems involving Earth-orbiting [[satellite]]s, it is now used in the [[aerospace]] and [[Defense contractor|defense communities]] and for many other applications.

AGI states that STK has more than 50,000 installations at more than 800 global organizations such as [[NASA]], [[ESA]], [[CNES]], [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]], [[Boeing]], [[JAXA]], [[ISRO]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[Northrop Grumman]], [[Airbus]], [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]], and [[Civil Air Patrol]].

*[[Satellite|Space missions]]
*[[Aircraft]] missions (including [[UAV]]s commonly known as drones)
*[[Missile defense]]

*[[Electronic warfare|Electronic systems]] and communications

STK [http://www.agi.com/products/stk/stk-10/ can be downloaded for free] and has paid upgrade modules for more complex capability. As of release 10, the free version of STK includes 3D visualization, previously a paid upgrade module. The latest version available is STK 11.1.

== History ==

In 1989, the three founders of Analytical Graphics, Inc. - Paul Graziani, Scott Reynolds and Jim Poland, left [[GE Aerospace]] to create Satellite Tool Kit (STK) as an alternative to bespoke, project-specific aerospace software.

The original version of STK ran only on [[Sun Microsystems]] computers, but as PCs became more powerful, the code was converted to run on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

STK was first adopted by the aerospace community for orbit analysis and access calculations (when a satellite can see a ground-station or image target), but as the software was expanded, more modules were added that included the ability to perform calculations for communications systems, [[radar]], interplanetary missions and orbit collision avoidance.

The addition of 3D viewing capabilities led to the adoption of the tool by military users for real-time visualization of air, land and sea forces as well as the space component. STK has also been used by various news organizations to graphically depict current events to a wider audience, including the deorbit of [[Mir space station|Russia's Mir Space Station]], the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], the [[2009 satellite collision|Iridium/Cosmos collision]], the [[asteroid 2012 DA14]] close approach and various [[North korea|North Korea]] missile tests.

As of version 10, the software underwent a name change from Satellite Tool Kit to Systems Tool Kit to reflect its applicability in land, sea, air, and space systems.

In 2016 AGI released [http://www.agi.com/products/stk11/ STK 11], offering a 64-bit Desktop version in addition to a 32-bit version, and Windows 10 support. This release featured Volumetric coverage with custom dynamic isosurfaces in any coordinate system, streaming Terrain Server for visualization, position, access and coverage, phased array antennas in the Comm and Radar modules, and custom models, materials and time dynamic thermal profiles with EOIR.

== Interface ==

The STK interface is a standard GUI display with customizable toolbars and dockable maps and 3D viewports. All analysis can be done through mouse and keyboard interaction.

In addition, there is a scripting interface named Connect that enables STK to act within a client/server environment (via [[TCP/IP]]) and is language independent. Users on Windows have the option of using STK programatically via [[OLE automation]].

Each analysis or design space within STK is called a ''scenario''. Within each scenario any number of satellites, aircraft, targets, ships, communications systems or other objects can be created. Each scenario defines the default temporal limits to the child objects, as well as the base unit selection and properties. All of these properties can be overridden for each child object individually, as necessary. Only one scenario may exist at any one time, although data can be exported and reused in subsequent analyses.

For each object within a scenario, various reports and graphics (both static and dynamic) may be created. Relative parameters, between one object and another can also be reported and the effect of real-world restrictions (''constraints'') enabled so that more accurate reporting is obtained. Through the use of the ''constellation'' and ''chains'' objects, multiple child objects may be grouped together and the multipath interactions between them investigated.

AGI also offers software development kits for embedding STK capabilities into third-party applications or creating new applications based on AGI technology.

== Modules ==

STK is a modular product, in much the same way as [[MATLAB]] and Simulink, and allows users to add modules to the baseline package to enhance specific functions.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

== Integration ==

STK can be embedded within another application (as an ActiveX component) or controlled from an external application (through [[TCP/IP]] or [[Component Object Model (COM)]]). Both integration techniques can make use of the ''connect'' scripting language to accomplish this task. There is also an object model for more "programmer oriented" integration methodologies. STK can be driven from a script that is run from the STK internal web browser in the free version of the tool. To control STK from an external source, or embed STK in another application requires the STK/Integration module.

=== Connect ===

Since connect is a messaging format, it has the advantage of being completely language independent. This allows applications and client tools to be created in the [[programming language]] of the user's or developer's choice. In practice, as long as it is possible to create a [[Berkeley sockets|socket connection]], send information through that socket and then receive information that way then STK can be controlled with connect using that language.

Applications have been developed in [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Perl]], [[Visual Basic]], [[VBScript]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]] and [[MATLAB]]. Examples can also be found in the STK help files or downloaded from the AGI website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9999">{{DISPLAYTITLE:Uniform ''k''&amp;thinsp;&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; polytope}}
In [[geometry]], a '''uniform ''k''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; polytope''' is a [[polytope]] in ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;4 dimensions constructed from the [[En (Lie algebra)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Coxeter group]], and having only [[regular polytope]] facets. The family was named by their [[Coxeter symbol]] '''''k''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;''' by its bifurcating [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]], with a single ring on the end of the ''k''-node sequence.

[[Thorold Gosset]] discovered this family as a part of his 1900 enumeration of the [[regular polytope|regular]] and [[semiregular polytope]]s, and so they are sometimes called '''Gosset's semiregular figures'''. Gosset named them by their dimension from 5 to 9, for example the ''5-ic semiregular figure''.

== Family members ==
The sequence as identified by Gosset ends as an infinite tessellation (space-filling honeycomb) in 8-space, called the [[E8 lattice]]. (A final form was not discovered by Gosset and is called the '''E9 lattice''': 6&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a tessellation of hyperbolic 9-space constructed of (∞ 9-[[simplex]] and ∞ 9-[[orthoplex]] facets with all vertices at infinity.)

The family starts uniquely as [[6-polytope]]s. The ''triangular prism'' and ''rectified 5-cell'' are included at the beginning for completeness. The ''demipenteract'' also exists in the [[demihypercube]] family.

They are also sometimes named by their symmetry group, like '''E6 polytope''', although there are many [[uniform polytope]]s within the [[E6 (mathematics)|''E''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] symmetry.

The complete family of Gosset semiregular polytopes are:
# [[triangular prism]]: −1&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; (2 [[triangle]]s and 3 [[Square (geometry)|square]] faces)
# [[rectified 5-cell]]: 0&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Tetroctahedric'' (5 [[Tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] and 5 [[Octahedron|octahedra]] cells)
# [[demipenteract]]: 1&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, ''5-ic semiregular figure'' (16 [[5-cell]] and 10 [[16-cell]] facets)
# [[2 21 polytope]]: 2&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, ''6-ic semiregular figure'' (72 5-[[simplex]] and 27 5-[[orthoplex]] facets)
# [[3 21 polytope]]: 3&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, ''7-ic semiregular figure'' (567 6-[[simplex]] and 126 6-[[orthoplex]] facets)
# [[4 21 polytope]]: 4&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, ''8-ic semiregular figure'' (17280 7-[[simplex]] and 2160 7-[[orthoplex]] facets)
# [[5 21 honeycomb]]: 5&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, ''9-ic semiregular check'' tessellates Euclidean 8-space (∞ 8-[[simplex]] and ∞ 8-[[orthoplex]] facets)
# [[6 21 honeycomb]]: 6&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;, tessellates hyperbolic 9-space (∞ 9-[[simplex]] and ∞ 9-[[orthoplex]] facets)

Each polytope is constructed from (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-[[simplex]] and (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-[[orthoplex]] facets.

The orthoplex faces are constructed from the [[Coxeter group]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; and have a [[Schläfli symbol]] of {3&lt;sup&gt;1,''n''&amp;minus;1,1&lt;/sup&gt;} rather than the regular {3&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;,4}. This construction is an implication of two "facet types". Half the facets around each orthoplex [[Ridge (geometry)|ridge]] are attached to another orthoplex, and the others are attached to a simplex. In contrast, every simplex ridge is attached to an orthoplex.

Each has a [[vertex figure]] as the previous form. For example, the ''rectified 5-cell'' has a vertex figure as a ''triangular prism''.

In [[mathematics]], the '''upper half-plane''' '''H''' is the set of points (''x,y'') in the [[Cartesian plane]] with ''y'' &gt; 0.

==Complex plane==
Mathematicians sometimes identify the Cartesian plane with the [[complex plane]], and then the upper half-plane corresponds to the set of [[complex number]]s with positive [[imaginary part]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H} = \{x + iy \mid y &gt; 0; x, y \in \mathbb{R} \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The term arises from a common visualization of the complex number ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''iy'' as the point (''x'',''y'') in [[the plane]] endowed with [[Cartesian coordinates]]. When the [[Y-axis]] is oriented vertically, the "upper [[half-plane]]" corresponds to the region above the X-axis and thus complex numbers for which&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.

It is the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of many functions of interest in [[complex analysis]], especially [[modular form]]s. The lower half-plane, defined by  ''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0, is equally good, but less used by convention. The [[open unit disk]] '''D''' (the set of all complex numbers of [[absolute value]] less than one) is equivalent by a [[conformal mapping]] to '''H''' (see "[[Poincaré metric]]"), meaning that it is usually possible to pass between '''H''' and '''D'''.

It also plays an important role in [[hyperbolic geometry]], where the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] provides a way of examining [[hyperbolic motion]]s. The Poincaré metric provides a hyperbolic [[metric tensor|metric]] on the space.

The [[uniformization theorem]] for [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s states that the '''upper half-plane''' is the [[covering map#Universal covers|universal covering space]] of surfaces with constant negative [[Gaussian curvature]].

The '''closed upper half-plane''' is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of the upper half-plane and the real axis. It is the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of the upper half-plane.

==Affine geometry==
The [[affine transformation]]s of the upper half-plane include (1) shifts (''x,y'') → (''x'' + ''c, y''), ''c'' ∈ ℝ, and (2) dilations (''x,y'') → (&amp;lambda; ''x'', &amp;lambda; ''y''),  &amp;lambda; &gt; 0.

'''Proposition:''' Let ''A'' and ''B'' be [[semicircle]]s in the upper half-plane with centers on the boundary. Then there is an affine mapping that takes ''A'' to ''B''.
:Proof: First shift the center of ''A'' to (0,0). Then take &amp;lambda; = (diameter of ''B'')/(diameter of ''A'') and dilate. Then shift (0,0) to the center of ''B''.

'''Definition:''' &lt;math&gt;Z = \{ (\cos^2 \theta , \tfrac{1}{2} \sin 2 \theta) : 0 &lt; \theta &lt; \pi \} .&lt;/math&gt;

''Z'' can be recognized as the circle of radius 1/2 centered at (1/2, 0), and as the [[polar plot]] of &lt;math&gt;\rho (\theta) = \cos \theta .&lt;/math&gt;

'''Proposition:''' (0,0), &amp;rho;(&amp;theta;) in ''Z'', and (1, tan &amp;theta;) are [[collinear points]].

In fact, ''Z'' is the reflection of the line (1,''y''), ''y'' &gt; 0, in the [[unit circle]]. Indeed, the diagonal from (0,0) to (1, tan &amp;theta;) has squared length &lt;math&gt;1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta, &lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\rho (\theta) = \cos \theta &lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal of that length.

===Metric geometry===
The distance between any two points ''p'' and ''q'' in the upper half-plane can be consistently defined as follows: The [[perpendicular bisector]] of the segment from ''p'' to ''q'' either intersects the boundary or is parallel to it. In the latter case ''p'' and ''q'' lie on a ray perpendicular to the boundary and [[logarithmic measure]] can be used to define a distance that is invariant under dilation. In the former case ''p'' and ''q'' lie on a circle centered at the intersection of their perpendicular bisector and the boundary. By the above proposition this circle can be moved by affine motion to ''Z''. Distances on ''Z'' can be defined using the correspondence with points on (1,''y''), ''y'' &gt; 0, and logarithmic measure on this ray. In consequence, the upper half-plane becomes a [[metric space]]. The generic name of this metric space is the [[hyperbolic plane]]. In terms of the models of [[hyperbolic geometry]], this model is frequently designated the [[Poincaré half-plane model]].

==Generalizations==
One natural generalization in [[differential geometry]] is [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic ''n''-space]] '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the maximally symmetric, [[simply connected]], ''n''-dimensional [[Riemannian manifold]] with constant [[sectional curvature]] −1. In this terminology, the upper half-plane is '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; since it has [[real (numbers)|real]] [[dimension]] 2.

In [[number theory]], the theory of [[Hilbert modular form]]s is concerned with the study of certain functions on the direct product '''H'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of ''n'' copies of the upper half-plane. Yet another space interesting to number theorists is the [[Siegel upper half-space]] '''H'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of [[Siegel modular form]]s.

'''William Lax''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]}} (1761 – 29 October 1836) was an English astronomer and mathematician who served as [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] for 41 years.

Lax was born in [[Ravensworth]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]]. He attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Cambridge and graduated [[Bachelor of Arts]] as the [[Senior Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]] and first [[Smith's Prize]]man of his year. He was elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity College, ordained as a minister, and received his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]]. Lax was granted the livings of vicar of [[Marsworth]], [[Buckinghamshire]] and of [[St Ippolyts]] near [[Hitchin]], [[Hertfordshire]], where he erected an [[observatory]].

Lax was best known for his ''Remarks on a Supposed Error in the Elements of Euclid'' (1807) and his work regarding the ''[[Nautical Almanac]]'', which was an important reference for navigation in the period. An obituary claimed that "To whatever Professor Lax applied, he made himself completely master of it". His daughter married [[Andrew Amos (lawyer)|Andrew Amos]] and through that line Lax is the grandfather of [[Sheldon Amos]] and the great grandfather of [[Maurice Amos]], a notable legal dynasty.

==Early life==
[[File:The Old Grammar School, Kirby Hill - geograph.org.uk - 1626080.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The former grammar school at Kirby Hill.]]
Lax was born in the village of [[Ravensworth]], near [[Richmond, North Yorkshire|Richmond]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], England, the son of William (1731 – 19 August 1812) also born in Ravensworth, and Hannah Lax (1738 – 10 June 1811).&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;A. M. Clerke, ‘Lax, William (1761–1836)’, rev. Anita McConnell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16213, accessed 30 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; He was christened on 27 October 1761 in [[Burneston]].

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1785 Lax was appointed [[Curate#Anglican Communion|curate]] of [[Tideswell]] in the [[Peak District]] of [[Derbyshire]] with an annual [[stipend]] of £35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LRO, B/A/1/24 (Episcopal Register 1777-85)|url=http://eagle.cch.kcl.ac.uk:8080/cce/DisplayAppointment.jsp?CDBAppRedID=111849|publisher=Episcopal Register|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1786, as was essentially the due of Senior Wranglers, he was elected a [[fellow]] of Trinity College.&lt;ref&gt;A Cambridge Alumni Database, Cambridge University Library, [http://venn.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/search.pl?sur=&amp;suro=c&amp;fir=&amp;firo=c&amp;cit=&amp;cito=c&amp;c=all&amp;tex=LS780W&amp;sye=&amp;eye=&amp;col=all&amp;maxcount=50 accessed 8 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter Linehan, fellows at this time, "were becoming richer, living and behaving more like gentlemen".&lt;ref name="Linehan2011" /&gt; He was [[ordained]] as a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in 1787 at [[Peterborough]] and received his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] (M.A.) in 1788.&lt;ref&gt;Country News..

As a moderator Lax was responsible for the introduction of "very high flown compliments, and at the same time extending the disputations to double the usual length, which was around one hour and ten minutes" which "sent a ripple through tradition" according to [[Greg Dening]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unreformed Cambridge: A Study of Certain Aspects of the University in the Eighteenth Century  |last=Winstanley |first=Denys Arthur |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781108002295 |page=350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dening1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Dening|title=The Death of William Gooch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f07IuBDw6qYC|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=1 October 1995|publisher=Melbourne University Publish|isbn=978-0-522-84692-8|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dening argues that this was, "Lax's way of getting into the act and making Acts flourish".&lt;ref name="Dening1995" /&gt; In 1791 he was appointed as a [[taxor]] by the University.&lt;ref&gt;"News."

===Lowndean Chair===
[[File:WrenCambridge.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Wren Library, Trinity College, Cambridge.]]

In 1795 Lax was appointed [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry]] in succession to [[John Smith (astronomer)|John Smith]]. The position was a [[sinecure]] with an annual salary initially of around £300, later rising to around £500 per annum by 1821.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite news |title=To Mr. Brougham, and the gentlemen for the committee for investigating abuses in public charity schools, &amp;c. |author=Thos.

During Lax's tenure a mathematical chair was seen as "a prize or a means of securing leisure, and at best, merely as offering a position where a man could pursue his own researches undisturbed by other duties".&lt;ref name="Ball1908"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter William Rouse Ball|title=A Short Account of the History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_sT_psl3uYkC|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=1908|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-20630-1|page=315|chapter=Chapters 311-323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1816 Lax was described as holding the professorship with "great reputation".&lt;ref name="WatkinsShoberl1816"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Watkins|author2=Frederic Shoberl|title=A biographical dictionary of the living Authors of Great Britain and Ireland: comparising literary memoirs and anecdotes of their lives; and a chronological register of their publications, with the number of editions printed; including notices of some foreign writers whose works have been occasionally published in England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ndLAAAAcAAJ|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=1816|publisher=Colburn|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sole duty of Lax's professorship was that he was required to examine students annually for the Smith's Prize, including [[John Herschel]], [[Adam Sedgwick]], [[George Biddell Airy]] and [[William Cavendish, 7th Duke of Devonshire]].&lt;ref name="AiryAiry2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=George Biddell Airy|author2=Wilfred Airy|title=Autobiography of Sir George Biddell Airy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1zaHfblHvUC|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=24 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-00894-5|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Passages from the Life of a Philosopher |last=Babbage |first=Charles |date=1864 |publisher=Longman |accessdate=5 July 2012 |url=https://archive.org/stream/passagesfromlif01babbgoog/passagesfromlif01babbgoog_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Lax's time at Cambridge: "the mathematicians were in the saddle, and it would be difficult to dispute the judgement that they controlled Cambridge studies almost as completely as the [[logician]]s had done in the [[Middle Ages]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66632 |title=The University of Cambridge - The age of Newton and Bentley (1660-1800) |author=J.

Lax did encounter some criticism during his tenure. Whilst at the university he "never, as far as is known, delivered a single lecture", despite his chair's [[bequest]] that the holder deliver forty lectures each year, although his predecessor had not given any lectures either.&lt;ref name="Garrett2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Garrett|title=Cambridge: A Cultural and Literary History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-gCqtMfi-YC|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=2004|publisher=Signal Books|isbn=978-1-902669-79-3|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball1889"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter William Rouse Ball|title=A history of the study of mathematics at Cambridge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AFcPAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=9 July 2012|date=1889|publisher=University Press|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excuse was made that there was already an astronomical chair at Cambridge established before the Lowndean that already gave lectures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; By the 1820s it was no longer acceptable to consider chairs as sinecures, and Lax received criticism from a living descendent of the original benefactor, [[Thomas Lowndes (astronomer)|Thomas Lowndes]], for being remiss in his duties.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; His successor to the Lowndean chair George Peacock promised "to do his duty in a less lax manner than his predecessor", and although he struggled to get anyone to attend his lectures on pure mathematics, his lectures on practical astronomy were well attended.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Harvey W.

===Fellow of the Royal Society===
[[File:SomersetHousebyAnonpublAckermann&amp;Co1836.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Somerset House]] in 1836, where the Royal Society met in Lax's time.]]
Lax was admitted a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] on 5 April 1796.

Lax delivered two papers to the Royal Society which were published in ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''. In 1799 he delivered ''A Method of finding the Latitude of a place, by Means of two Altitudes of the Sun and the Time elapsed betwixt the Observations'', described as containing "several valuable remarks", but criticised as "a subject of no great importance" by the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Overall1870"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Henry Overall |author-link=William Henry Overall|title=The dictionary of chronology, or historical and statistical register|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwluAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=1870|publisher=W.

In it Lax defended the Greek mathematician against a charge levied at him by [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] in 1756.

===Board of Longitude===
Lax was elected to the [[Board of Longitude]] after he was nominated to the Lowndean chair in 1795, and remained on the board until it was dissolved in 1828.&lt;ref name="The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year ..."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAgAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP13|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=1800|publisher=order of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomas Young: Natural Philosopher 1773-1829 |last=Wood |first=Alexander |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521263764 |page=343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board was a governmental body charged with administering a scheme of prizes intended to encourage innovators to solve the problem of finding [[longitude]] at sea, which was vital for accurate navigation. Lax published a set of tables for use with the ''Nautical Almanac'' for finding [[latitude]] and longitude; these were published by the Board of Longitude in 1821, and whilst they were not considered to be of much practical use for seamen, they were described by ''[[The Nautical Magazine]]'' as a "very meritorious attempt to solve the problems of nautical astronomy by one uniform system."&lt;ref name="The Nautical magazine: a journal of papers on subjects connected with maritime affairs"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nautical magazine: a journal of papers on subjects connected with maritime affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA281|accessdate=2 July 2012|date=1832|publisher=Brown, Son and Ferguson|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=The Nautical Magazine |year=1840 |volume=9 |page=897 |title=in pages 896–899 of Review of ''The Practice of Navigational and Nautical Astronomy'' by H.

Murray|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a scientific member of the Board, Lax was one of eighteen men who were, according to Edmund Dews, "ultimately responsible for the form and contents of the ''Nautical Almanac''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48857">In [[mathematics]], a '''zonal spherical function''' or often just '''spherical function''' is a function on a [[locally compact group]] ''G'' with compact subgroup ''K'' (often a [[maximal compact subgroup]]) that arises as the [[matrix coefficient]] of a ''K''-invariant vector in an [[irreducible representation]] of ''G''. The key examples are the matrix coefficients of the ''[[principal series|spherical principal series]]'', the irreducible representations appearing in the decomposition of the [[unitary representation]] of ''G'' on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''K''). In this case the [[commutant]] of ''G'' is generated by the algebra of biinvariant functions on ''G'' with respect to ''K'' acting by right [[convolution]]. It is [[commutative]] if in addition ''G''/''K'' is a [[symmetric space]], for example when ''G'' is a connected semisimple Lie group with finite centre and ''K'' is a maximal compact subgroup. The matrix coefficients of the spherical principal series describe precisely the [[spectrum]] of the corresponding
[[C* algebra]] generated by the biinvariant functions of [[compact support]], often called a [[Hecke algebra of a locally compact group|Hecke algebra]]. The spectrum of the commutative Banach *-algebra of biinvariant ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; functions is larger; when ''G'' is a semisimple Lie group with maximal compact subgroup ''K'', additional characters come from matrix coefficients of the [[complementary series]], obtained by analytic continuation of the spherical principal series.

Zonal spherical functions have been explicitly determined for real semisimple groups by [[Harish-Chandra]]. For [[special linear group]]s, they were independently discovered by [[Israel Gelfand]] and [[Mark Naimark]].  For complex groups, the theory simplifies significantly, because ''G'' is the [[complexification]] of ''K'', and the formulas are related to analytic continuations of the [[Weyl character formula]] on ''K''. The abstract [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] theory of zonal spherical functions was first developed by [[Roger Godement]]. Apart from their group theoretic interpretation, the zonal spherical functions for a semisimple Lie group ''G'' also provide a set of simultaneous [[eigenfunction]]s for the natural action of the centre of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of ''G'' on  ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''K''), as [[differential operator]]s on the symmetric space ''G''/''K''. For semisimple [[p-adic]] Lie groups, the theory of zonal spherical functions and Hecke algebras was first developed by Satake and [[Ian G. Macdonald]]. The analogues of the [[Plancherel theorem]] and [[Fourier inversion formula]] in this setting generalise the eigenfunction expansions of Mehler, Weyl and Fock for [[Spectral theory of ordinary differential equations|singular ordinary differential equations]]: they were obtained in full generality in the 1960s in terms of [[Harish-Chandra's c-function]].

The name "zonal spherical function" comes from the case when ''G'' is SO(3,'''R''') acting on a 2-sphere and ''K'' is the subgroup fixing a point: in this case the zonal spherical functions can be regarded as certain functions on the sphere invariant under rotation about a fixed axis.

==Definitions==
{{See also|Hecke algebra of a locally compact group}}
Let ''G'' be a [[locally compact]] [[unimodular group|unimodular]] [[topological group]] and ''K'' a [[compact space|compact]] [[subgroup]] and let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''K''). Thus ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; admits a [[unitary representation]] π  of ''G'' by left translation. This is a subrepresentation of the regular representation, since if ''H''= ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'') with left and right [[regular representation]]s  λ  and  ρ  of ''G'' and ''P'' is the [[orthogonal projection]]

:&lt;math&gt; P =\int_K \rho(k) \, dk&lt;/math&gt;

from ''H'' to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; then ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can naturally be identified with ''PH'' with the action of ''G'' given by the restriction of λ.

On the other hand, by [[commutation theorem|von Neumann's commutation theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dixmier|1996}}, Algèbres hilbertiennes.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(G)^\prime= \rho(G)^{\prime\prime},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''S''' denotes the [[commutant]] of a set of operators ''S'', so that

:&lt;math&gt; \pi(G)^\prime = P \rho(G)^{\prime\prime}P. &lt;/math&gt;

Thus the commutant of π is generated as a [[von Neumann algebra]] by operators

:&lt;math&gt; P\rho(f)P = \int_G f(g) (P \rho(g)P) \, dg&lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is a continuous function of compact support on ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;If σ is a unitary representation of ''G'', then &lt;math&gt;\sigma(f)=\int_G f(g)\sigma(g)\, dg&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

However ''P''ρ(''f'') ''P'' is just the restriction of ρ(''F'') to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt; F(g) =\int_K \int_K f(kgk^\prime) \, dk\, dk^\prime &lt;/math&gt;

is the ''K''-biinvariant continuous function of compact support obtained by averaging ''f'' by ''K'' on both sides.

Thus the commutant of π is generated by the restriction of the operators ρ(''F'') with ''F'' in
''C''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''K''\''G''/''K''), the ''K''-biinvariant continuous functions of compact support on ''G''.

These functions form a [[* algebra]] under [[convolution]] with involution

:&lt;math&gt; F^*(g) =\overline{F(g^{-1})}, &lt;/math&gt;

often called the [[Hecke algebra of a locally compact group|Hecke algebra]] for the pair (''G'', ''K'').

Let ''A''(''K''\''G''/''K'') denote the [[C* algebra]] generated by the operators  ρ(''F'') on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

The pair (''G'', ''K'')
is said to be a [[Gelfand pair]] &lt;ref name="harvnb|Dieudonné |1978"&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné |1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; if one, and hence all, of the following algebras are [[commutative]]:

* &lt;math&gt; \pi(G)^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; C_c(K\backslash G /K) &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt; A(K\backslash G /K).&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''A''(''K''\''G''/''K'') is a commutative [[C* algebra]], by the [[Gelfand–Naimark theorem]] it has the form ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''),
where ''X'' is the locally compact space of norm continuous * [[homomorphism]]s of  ''A''(''K''\''G''/''K'') into '''C'''.

A concrete realization  of the * homomorphisms in ''X'' as ''K''-biinvariant [[uniformly bounded]] functions on ''G'' is obtained as follows.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Dieudonné |1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Godement|1952"&gt;{{harvnb|Godement|1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helgason2001"&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lang1985"&gt;{{harvnb|Lang|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the estimate

:&lt;math&gt; \|\pi(F)\|\le \int_G |F(g)| \, dg \equiv \|F\|_1,&lt;/math&gt;

the representation π of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''K''\''G''/''K'') in ''A''(''K''\''G''/''K'') extends by continuity
to  L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''K''\''G''/''K''),  the [[* algebra]] of ''K''-biinvariant integrable functions. The image forms
a dense * subalgebra of ''A''(''K''\''G''/''K''). The restriction of a * homomorphism χ continuous for the operator norm is
also continuous for the norm ||·||&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since the [[Banach space|Banach space dual]] of L&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is L&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;,
it follows that

:&lt;math&gt; \chi(\pi(F)) =\int_G F(g) h(g) \, dg,&lt;/math&gt;

for some unique uniformly bounded ''K''-biinvariant function ''h'' on ''G''. These functions ''h'' are exactly the '''zonal spherical functions''' for the pair (''G'', ''K'').

==Properties==
A zonal spherical function ''h'' has the following properties:&lt;ref name="harvnb|Dieudonné |1978"/&gt;

# ''h'' is uniformly continuous on ''G''
# &lt;math&gt; h(x) h(y) = \int_K h(xky) \,dk \,\,(x,y\in G).&lt;/math&gt;
# ''h''(1) =1 (normalisation)
# ''h'' is a [[positive definite function on a group|positive definite function]] on ''G''
# ''f''  * ''h'' is proportional to ''h'' for all ''f'' in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''K''\''G''/''K'').

These are easy consequences of the fact that the bounded linear functional χ defined by ''h'' is a homomorphism.  Properties 2, 3 and 4 or properties 3, 4 and 5 characterize zonal spherical functions. A more general class of zonal spherical functions can be obtained by dropping positive definiteness from the conditions, but for these functions there is no longer any connection
with [[unitary representation]]s. For semisimple Lie groups, there is a further characterization as eigenfunctions of
[[invariant differential operator]]s on ''G''/''K'' (see below).

In fact, as a special case of the [[Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction]], there is one-one correspondence between
irreducible representations σ of ''G'' having a unit vector ''v'' fixed by ''K'' and zonal spherical functions
''h'' given by

:&lt;math&gt; h(g) = (\sigma(g) v,v).&lt;/math&gt;

Such irreducible representations are often described as having '''class one'''. They are precisely the irreducible representations required to decompose the [[induced representation]] π on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Each representation σ extends uniquely by continuity
to ''A''(''K''\''G''/''K''), so that each zonal spherical function satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \left|\int_G f(g) h(g)\, dg\right| \le \|\pi(f)\|&lt;/math&gt;

for ''f'' in ''A''(''K''\''G''/''K''). Moreover, since the commutant π(''G'')' is commutative,
there is a unique probability measure μ on the space of * homomorphisms ''X'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \int_G |f(g)|^2 \, dg = \int_X |\chi(\pi(f))|^2 \, d\mu(\chi).&lt;/math&gt;

μ is called the '''[[Plancherel measure]]'''. Since π(''G'')' is the [[von Neumann algebra|centre]] of the von Neumann algebra generated by ''G'', it also gives the measure associated with the [[direct integral]] decomposition of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the irreducible representations σ&lt;sub&gt;χ&lt;/sub&gt;.

If ''G'' is a [[Connectedness|connected]] [[Lie group]], then, thanks to the work of [[Élie Cartan|Cartan]], [[Anatoly Maltsev|Malcev]], [[Kenkichi Iwasawa|Iwasawa]] and [[Claude Chevalley|Chevalley]], ''G'' has a [[maximal compact subgroup]], unique up to conjugation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cartier|1954-1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hochschild|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case ''K'' is connected and the quotient ''G''/''K'' is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space. When ''G'' is in addition [[Semisimple Lie group|semisimple]], this can be seen directly using the [[Cartan decomposition]] associated to the [[symmetric space]] ''G''/''K'', a generalisation of the [[polar decomposition]] of invertible matrices. Indeed, if τ is the associated period two automorphism of ''G'' with fixed point subgroup ''K'', then

:&lt;math&gt;G=P\cdot K,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; P= \{g\in G| \tau(g)=g^{-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Under the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]], ''P'' is diffeomorphic to the -1 eigenspace of τ in the [[Lie algebra]] of ''G''.
Since τ preserves ''K'', it induces an automorphism of the Hecke algebra ''C''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''K''\''G''/''K''). On the
other hand, if ''F'' lies in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(''K''\''G''/''K''), then

:''F''(τ''g'') = ''F''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;),

so that τ induces an anti-automorphism, because  inversion does. Hence, when ''G'' is semisimple,

*the Hecke algebra is commutative
*(''G'',''K'') is a Gelfand pair.

More generally the same argument gives the following criterion of Gelfand for (''G'',''K'') to be a Gelfand pair:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1978|pp=55–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''G'' is a unimodular locally compact group;
*''K'' is a compact subgroup arising as the fixed points of a period two automorphism τ of ''G'';
*''G'' =''K''·''P'' (not necessarily a direct product), where ''P'' is defined as above.

The two most important examples covered by this are when:

* ''G'' is a compact connected semisimple Lie group with τ a period two automorphism;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''G'' is a semidirect product &lt;math&gt;A\rtimes K&lt;/math&gt;, with ''A'' a locally compact Abelian group without 2-torsion and τ(''a''· ''k'')= ''k''·''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for ''a'' in ''A'' and ''k'' in ''K''.

The three cases cover the three types of [[symmetric space]]s ''G''/''K'':&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"/&gt;

# ''Non-compact type'', when ''K'' is a maximal compact subgroup of a non-compact real semisimple Lie group ''G'';
# ''Compact type'', when ''K'' is the fixed point subgroup of a period two automorphism of a compact semisimple Lie group ''G'';
# ''Euclidean type'', when ''A'' is a finite-dimensional Euclidean space with an orthogonal action of ''K''.

==Cartan–Helgason theorem==
Let ''G'' be a compact semisimple connected and simply connected Lie group and τ a period two automorphism of a ''G'' with fixed point subgroup ''K'' = ''G''&lt;sup&gt;τ&lt;/sup&gt;. In this case ''K'' is a connected compact Lie group.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984" /&gt; In addition let ''T'' be a [[maximal torus]] of ''G'' invariant under τ, such that ''T'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''P'' is a maximal torus in ''P'', and set&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=257–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S= K\cap T = T^\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

''S'' is the direct product of a torus and an [[elementary abelian group|elementary abelian 2-group]].

In 1929 [[Élie Cartan]] found a rule to determine the decomposition of L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''K'') into the direct sum of finite-dimensional [[irreducible representation]]s of ''G'', which was proved rigorously only in 1970 by [[Sigurdur Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurdur Helgason]]. Because the commutant of ''G'' on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''K'') is commutative, each irreducible representation appears with multiplicity one. By [[Frobenius reciprocity]] for compact groups, the irreducible representations ''V''  that occur are precisely those admitting a non-zero vector fixed by ''K''.

From the [[Weyl character formula|representation theory of compact semisimple groups]], irreducible representations of ''G'' are classified by their [[root system|highest weight]]. This is specified by a homomorphism of the maximal torus ''T'' into '''T'''.

The '''Cartan–Helgason theorem'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984|pp=534–538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|Wallach|1998|pp=549–550}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" |
|the irreducible representations of ''G'' admitting a non-zero vector fixed by ''K'' are precisely those with highest weights corresponding to homomorphisms trivial on ''S''.
|}

The corresponding irreducible representations are called ''spherical representations''.

The theorem can be proved&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"/&gt; using the [[Iwasawa decomposition]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{a} \oplus \mathfrak{n},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; are the complexifications of the [[Lie algebra]]s of ''G'', ''K'', ''A'' = ''T'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''P'' and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{n}=\bigoplus \mathfrak{g}_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

summed over all eigenspaces for ''T'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to [[root system|positive roots]] α not fixed by τ.

Let ''V'' be a spherical representation with highest weight vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''-fixed vector ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an eigenvector of the solvable Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}\oplus\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]]
implies that the ''K''-module generated by ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the whole of ''V''. If ''Q'' is the orthogonal projection onto the fixed points of ''K'' in ''V'' obtained by averaging over ''G'' with respect to [[Haar measure]], it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ v_K = c Qv_0}&lt;/math&gt;

for some non-zero constant ''c''. Because ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; is fixed by ''S'' and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an eigenvector for ''S'', the subgroup ''S'' must actually fix ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, an equivalent form of the triviality condition on ''S''.

Conversely if ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is fixed by ''S'', then it can be shown&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|Wallach|1998|p=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the matrix coefficient

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{f(g) =(gv_0,v_0)}&lt;/math&gt;

is non-negative on ''K''. Since ''f''(1) &gt; 0, it follows that (''Qv''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; 0 and hence that ''Qv''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a non-zero vector fixed by ''K''.

==Harish-Chandra's formula==
If ''G'' is a non-compact semisimple Lie group, its maximal compact subgroup ''K'' acts by conjugation on the component ''P'' in the [[Cartan decomposition]]. If ''A'' is a maximal Abelian subgroup of ''G'' contained in ''P'', then ''A'' is diffeomorphic to its Lie algebra under the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] and, as a [[Lie group decompositions|further generalisation]] of the [[polar decomposition]] of matrices, every element of ''P'' is conjugate under ''K'' to an element of ''A'', so that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}, Chapter IX.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''G'' =''KAK''.

There is also an associated [[Iwasawa decomposition]]

:''G'' =''KAN'',

where ''N'' is a closed nilpotent subgroup, diffeomorphic to its Lie algebra under the exponential map and normalised by ''A''. Thus
''S''=''AN'' is a closed [[solvable group|solvable subgroup]] of ''G'', the [[semidirect product]] of ''N'' by ''A'', and ''G'' = ''KS''.

If  α in Hom(''A'','''T''') is a [[character (mathematics)|character]] of ''A'', then α extends to a character of ''S'', by defining it to be trivial on ''N''.  There is a corresponding [[unitary representation|unitary]] [[induced representation]] σ of ''G'' on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''S'') = L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''K''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harish-Chandra|1954a|p= 251}}&lt;/ref&gt; a so-called [[principal series representation|(spherical) principal series representation]].

This representation can be described explicitly as follows. Unlike ''G'' and ''K'', the solvable Lie group ''S'' is not unimodular. Let ''dx'' denote left invariant Haar measure on ''S'' and Δ&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; the [[Haar measure#The modular function|modular function]] of ''S''. Then&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \int_G f(g) \,dg = \int_S\int_K f(x\cdot k) \, dx\, dk = \int_S\int_K f(k\cdot x) \Delta_S(x)\,dx\, dk.&lt;/math&gt;

The principal series representation σ is realised on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''K'') as&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallach|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (\sigma(g) \xi)(k) = \alpha^\prime(g^{-1}k)^{-1} \, \xi(U(g^{-1}k)), &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;g = U(g)\cdot X(g)&lt;/math&gt;

is the Iwasawa decomposition of ''g'' with ''U''(''g'') in ''K'' and ''X''(''g'') in ''S'' and

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^\prime(kx) = \Delta_S(x)^{1/2} \alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' in ''K'' and ''x'' in ''S''.

The representation σ is irreducible, so that if ''v'' denotes the constant function 1 on ''K'', fixed by ''K'',

:&lt;math&gt; \varphi_\alpha(g)=(\sigma(g)v,v)&lt;/math&gt;

defines a zonal spherical function of ''G''.

Computing the inner product above leads to '''Harish-Chandra's formula''' for the zonal spherical function

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\varphi_\alpha(g) = \int_K \alpha^\prime(gk)^{-1}\, dk &lt;/math&gt;
|}

as an integral over ''K''.

Harish-Chandra proved that these zonal spherical functions exhaust the characters of the [[C* algebra]] generated by the ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'' \ ''G'' / ''K'') acting by right convolution on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'' / ''K''). He also showed that two different characters α and β give the same zonal spherical function if and only if α = β·''s'', where ''s'' is in the [[Weyl group]] of ''A''

:&lt;math&gt; W(A)=N_K(A)/C_K(A),&lt;/math&gt;

the quotient of the [[normaliser]] of ''A'' in ''K'' by its [[centraliser]], a [[finite reflection group]].

It can also be verified directly&lt;ref name="harvnb|Dieudonné |1978"/&gt; that this formula defines a zonal spherical function, without using representation theory. The proof for general semisimple Lie groups that every zonal spherical formula arises in this way requires the detailed study of ''G''-[[invariant differential operator]]s on ''G''/''K'' and their simultaneous [[eigenfunctions]] (see below).&lt;ref name="Helgason2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"/&gt; In the case of complex semisimple groups, Harish-Chandra and [[Felix Berezin]] realised independently that the formula simplified considerably and could be proved more directly.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berezin|1956a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berezin|1956b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harish-Chandra|1954b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harish-Chandra|1954c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining positive-definite zonal spherical functions are given
by Harish-Chandra's formula with α in Hom(''A'','''C'''*) instead of Hom(''A'','''T'''). Only certain α are permitted and the corresponding irreducible
representations arise as analytic continuations of the spherical principal series. This so-called "[[complementary series]]" was first studied by {{harvtxt|Bargmann|1947}} for ''G'' = SL(2,'''R''') and by {{harvtxt|Harish-Chandra|1947}} and {{harvtxt|Gelfand|Naimark|1947}} for ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''').
Subsequently in the 1960s, the construction of a [[complementary series]] by analytic continuation of the spherical principal series was systematically developed for general semisimple Lie groups by Ray Kunze, [[Elias Stein]] and  [[Bertram Kostant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kunze|Stein|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kostant|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these irreducible representations are not [[tempered representation|tempered]], they are not usually required for harmonic analysis on ''G'' (or ''G'' / ''K'').

==Eigenfunctions==
Harish-Chandra proved&lt;ref name="Helgason2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"/&gt; that zonal spherical functions can be characterised as those normalised positive definite ''K''-invariant functions on ''G''/''K'' that are eigenfunctions of ''D''(''G''/''K''), the algebra of invariant differential operators on ''G''. This algebra acts on ''G''/''K'' and commutes with the natural action of ''G'' by left translation. It can be identified with the subalgebra of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of ''G'' fixed under the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint action]] of ''K''.  As for the commutant of ''G'' on L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G''/''K'') and the corresponding Hecke algebra, this algebra of operators is [[commutative]]; indeed it is a subalgebra of the [[affiliated operator|algebra of mesurable operators]] affiliated with the commutant π(''G'')', an Abelian von Neumann algebra. As Harish-Chandra proved, it is isomorphic to the algebra of ''W''(''A'')-invariant polynomials on the Lie algebra of ''A'', which itself is a [[polynomial ring]] by the [[Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem]] on polynomial invariants of [[finite reflection group]]s. The simplest invariant differential operator on ''G''/''K'' is the [[Laplacian operator]]; up to a sign this operator is just the image under π of the [[Casimir operator]] in the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of ''G''.

Thus a normalised positive definite ''K''-biinvariant function ''f'' on ''G'' is a zonal spherical function if and only if for each ''D'' in ''D''(''G''/''K'') there is a constant λ&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\pi(D)f =\lambda_D f,&lt;/math&gt;

i.e. ''f'' is a simultaneous [[eigenfunction]] of the operators π(''D'').

If ψ is a zonal spherical function, then, regarded as a function on ''G''/''K'', it is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian
there, an [[elliptic differential operator]] with [[real analytic]] coefficients. By [[FBI transform#Holmgren's uniqueness theorem|analytic elliptic regularity]],
ψ is a real analytic function on ''G''/''K'', and hence ''G''.

Harish-Chandra used these facts about the structure of the invariant operators to prove that his formula gave all zonal spherical functions for real semisimple Lie groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harish-Chandra|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Helgason|2001}}, pages 418–422, 427-434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the commutativity of the commutant implies that the simultaneous eigenspaces of the algebra of invariant differential operators all have dimension one; and the polynomial structure of this algebra forces the simultaneous eigenvalues to be precisely those already associated with Harish-Chandra's formula.

==Example: SL(2,C)==
{{See also|SL(2,C)|Representations of the Lorentz group|Spectral theory of ordinary differential equations}}
The group ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''') is the [[complexification]] of the [[compact Lie group]] ''K'' = SU(2) and the [[Double covering group|double cover]] of the [[Lorentz group]]. The infinite-dimensional representations of the Lorentz group were first studied by [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] in 1945, who considered the [[discrete series]] representations, which he termed ''expansors''. A systematic study was taken up shortly afterwards by Harish-Chandra, Gelfand–Naimark and
Bargmann. The irreducible representations of class one, corresponding to the zonal spherical functions, can be determined easily using the radial
component of the [[Laplacian operator]].&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984" /&gt;

Indeed, any unimodular complex 2×2 matrix ''g'' admits a unique [[polar decomposition]] ''g'' = ''pv'' with ''v'' unitary and ''p'' positive. In turn
''p'' = ''uau''*, with ''u'' unitary and ''a'' a diagonal matrix with positive entries. Thus ''g'' = ''uaw'' with ''w'' = ''u''* ''v'', so that any ''K''-biinvariant function on ''G'' corresponds to a function of the diagonal matrix

:&lt;math&gt;a = \begin{pmatrix} e^{r/2} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; e^{-r/2} \end{pmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

invariant under the Weyl group. Identifying ''G''/''K'' with hyperbolic 3-space, the zonal hyperbolic functions ψ correspond to radial functions that are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian. But in terms of the radial coordinate ''r'', the Laplacian is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L= -\partial_r^2 - 2 \coth r \partial_r.&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''f''(''r'') = sinh (''r'')·ψ(''r''), it follows that ''f'' is an [[odd function]] of ''r'' and an eigenfunction of &lt;math&gt;\partial_r^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Hence

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\varphi(r) = {\sin (\ell r)\over \ell \sinh r}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is real.

There is a similar elementary treatment for the [[Lorentz group#Generalization to higher dimensions|generalized Lorentz group]]s SO(''N'',1) in {{harvtxt|Takahashi|1963}} and {{harvtxt|Faraut|Korányi|1994}} (recall that SO&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(3,1) = SL(2,'''C''') / ±I).

==Complex case==
If ''G'' is a complex semisimple Lie group, it is the [[complexification]] of its maximal compact subgroup ''K''. If &lt;math&gt;{\mathfrak
g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; are their Lie algebras, then

:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \oplus i\mathfrak{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let ''T'' be a [[maximal torus]] in ''K'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;A= \exp i \mathfrak{t}, \,\, P= \exp i \mathfrak{k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt; W= N_K(T)/T&lt;/math&gt;

be the [[Weyl group]] of ''T'' in ''K''. Recall characters in Hom(''T'','''T''') are called [[weight (representation theory)|weights]] and can be identified with elements of the [[weight lattice]] Λ in
Hom(&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, '''R''') = &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}^*&lt;/math&gt;. There is a natural ordering on weights and every finite-dimensional irreducible representation (π, ''V'') of ''K'' has a unique highest weight λ. The weights of the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]] of ''K'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}\ominus \mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; are called roots and ρ is used to denote half the sum of the [[positive root]]s α, [[Weyl's character formula]] asserts that for ''z'' = exp ''X'' in ''T''

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle\chi_\lambda(e^X)\equiv {\rm Tr} \, \pi(z) = A_{\lambda+\rho}(e^X)/A_{\rho}(e^X),&lt;/math&gt;

where, for μ in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}^*&lt;/math&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; denotes the antisymmetrisation

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle A_\mu(e^X) =\sum_{s\in W} \varepsilon(s) e^{i\mu(sX)},&lt;/math&gt;

and ε denotes the ''sign character'' of the [[finite reflection group]] ''W''.

[[Weyl's denominator formula]] expresses the denominator ''A''&lt;sub&gt;ρ&lt;/sub&gt; as a product:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle A_\rho(e^X) = e^{i\rho(X)} \prod_{\alpha&gt;0}(1 - e^{-i\alpha(X)}),&lt;/math&gt;

where the product is over the positive roots.

[[Weyl's dimension formula]] asserts that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\chi_\lambda(1) \equiv {\rm dim}\, V = {\prod_{\alpha&gt;0} (\lambda + \rho,\alpha)\over \prod_{\alpha&gt;0} (\rho,\alpha)}.&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[inner product]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}^*&lt;/math&gt; is that associated with the [[Killing form]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now

*every irreducible representation of ''K'' extends  holomorphically to the complexification ''G''
*every irreducible character χ&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;(''k'') of ''K'' extends  holomorphically to the complexification  of ''K'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}^*&lt;/math&gt;.
* for every λ in Hom(''A'','''T''') = &lt;math&gt; i\mathfrak{t}^*&lt;/math&gt;, there is a zonal spherical function φ&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;.

The '''Berezin–Harish–Chandra formula'''&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"/&gt; asserts that for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt; \varphi_\lambda(e^X) = {\chi_\lambda(e^X)\over\chi_\lambda(1)}.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

In other words:

*'''''the zonal spherical functions on a complex semisimple Lie group are given by analytic continuation of the formula for the normalised characters.'''''

One of the simplest proofs&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984|pp=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; of this formula involves the ''radial component'' on ''A'' of the Laplacian on ''G'', a proof formally parallel to Helgason's reworking of [[Freudenthal]]'s classical proof of the [[Weyl character formula]], using the radial component on ''T'' of the Laplacian on ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984|pp= 501–502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter case the [[class function]]s on ''K'' can be identified with ''W''-invariant functions on ''T''. The
radial component of Δ&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''T'' is just the expression for the restriction of  Δ&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''W''-invariant functions on ''T'', where
it is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta_K=  h^{-1}\circ \Delta_T \circ h + \|\rho\|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(e^X) = A_\rho(e^X)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. If χ is a character with highest weight λ, it follows that φ = ''h''·χ satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_T \varphi= (\|\lambda + \rho\|^2 -\|\rho\|^2) \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus for every weight μ with non-zero [[Fourier coefficient]] in φ,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \|\lambda +\rho\|^2 = \|\mu+\rho\|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The classical argument of Freudenthal shows that μ + ρ must have the form ''s''(λ + ρ) for some ''s'' in ''W'', so the character formula
follows from the antisymmetry of φ.

Similarly ''K''-biinvariant functions on ''G'' can be identified with ''W''(''A'')-invariant functions on ''A''. The
radial component of Δ&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''A'' is just the expression for the restriction of  Δ&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; to ''W''(''A'')-invariant functions on ''A''.
It is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta_G=  H^{-1}\circ \Delta_A\circ H - \|\rho\|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H(e^X) = A_\rho(e^X)&lt;/math&gt;

for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;.

The Berezin–Harish–Chandra formula for a zonal spherical function φ can be established by introducing the antisymmetric function

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f= H\cdot\varphi,&lt;/math&gt;

which is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian Δ&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;. Since ''K'' is generated by copies of subgroups that are homomorphic images of SU(2) corresponding to [[root of a polynomial|simple roots]], its complexification ''G'' is generated by the corresponding homomorphic images of SL(2,'''C'''). The formula for zonal spherical functions of SL(2,'''C''') implies that ''f'' is a [[periodic function]] on  &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to some [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|sublattice]]. Antisymmetry under the Weyl group and the argument of Freudenthal again imply that ψ must have the stated form up to a multiplicative constant, which can be determined using the Weyl dimension formula.

==Example: SL(2,R)==
{{See also|SL(2,R)|Representation theory of SL2(R)|Spectral theory of ordinary differential equations}}
The theory of zonal spherical functions for [[SL(2,R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] originated in the work of [[Gustav Ferdinand Mehler|Mehler]] in 1881 on hyperbolic geometry. He discovered the analogue of the Plancherel theorem, which was rediscovered by Fock in 1943. The corresponding eigenfunction expansion is termed the [[Mehler–Fock transform]]. It was already put on a firm footing in 1910 by [[Hermann Weyl]]'s important work on the [[spectral theory of ordinary differential equations]]. The radial part of the Laplacian in this case leads to a [[hypergeometric differential equation]], the theory of which was treated in detail by Weyl. Weyl's approach was subsequently generalised by Harish-Chandra to study zonal spherical functions and the corresponding Plancherel theorem for more general semimisimple Lie groups. Following the work of Dirac on the discrete series representations of SL(2,'''R'''), the general theory of unitary irreducible representations of  SL(2,'''R''') was developed independently by Bargmann, Harish-Chandra and Gelfand–Naimark. The irreducible representations of class one, or equivalently the theory of zonal spherical functions, form an important special case of this theory.

The group ''G'' = [[SL(2,R)|SL(2,'''R''')]] is a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of the 3-dimensional [[Lorentz group]] SO(2,1), the [[symmetry group]] of the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] with its [[Poincaré metric]]. It acts by [[Möbius transformation]]s. The upper half-plane can be identified with the unit disc by the [[Cayley transform]]. Under this identification ''G'' becomes identified with the group SU(1,1), also acting by Möbius transformations. Because the action is [[transitive action|transitive]], both spaces can be identified with ''G''/''K'', where ''K'' = [[SO(2)]]. The metric is invariant under ''G'' and the associated Laplacian is ''G''-invariant, coinciding with the image of the [[Casimir operator]]. In the upper half-plane model the Laplacian is given by the formula&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lang1985" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\Delta=-4y^{2}(\partial_x^2 +\partial_y^2).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' is a complex number and ''z'' = ''x + i y'' with ''y'' &gt; 0, the function

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f_s(z) =y^{s}= \exp({s}\cdot\log y),&lt;/math&gt;

is an eigenfunction of Δ:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \Delta f_s = 4s(1-s) f_s.&lt;/math&gt;

Since Δ commutes with ''G'', any left translate of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is also an eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue. In particular, averaging over ''K'', the function

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt; \varphi_s(z) =\int_K f_s(k\cdot z)\, dk&lt;/math&gt;
|}

is a ''K''-invariant eigenfunction of Δ on ''G''/''K''. When

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s={1\over 2} + i\tau,&lt;/math&gt;

with τ real, these functions give all the zonal spherical functions on ''G''. As with Harish-Chandra's more general formula for semisimple Lie groups, φ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is a zonal spherical function because it is the matrix coefficient corresponding to a vector fixed by ''K'' in the [[principal series]]. Various arguments are available to prove that there are no others. One of the simplest classical [[Lie algebra]]ic arguments&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lang1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bargmann 1947"&gt;{{harvnb|Bargmann|1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe 1992"&gt;{{harvnb|Howe | Tan |1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wallach|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to note that, since Δ is an elliptic operator with analytic coefficients, by analytic elliptic regularity any eigenfunction is necessarily real analytic. Hence, if the zonal spherical function corresponds is the matrix coefficient for a vector ''v'' and representation σ, the vector ''v'' is an [[unitary representation|analytic vector]] for ''G'' and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle(\sigma(e^{X})v,v)= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (\sigma(X)^n v,v)/n!&lt;/math&gt;

for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The infinitesimal form of the irreducible unitary representations with a vector fixed by ''K'' were worked out classically by Bargmann.&lt;ref name="Bargmann 1947"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe 1992"/&gt; They correspond precisely to the principal series of SL(2,'''R'''). It follows that the zonal spherical function corresponds to a principal series representation.

Another classical argument&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|2001|p= 405}}&lt;/ref&gt; proceeds by showing that on radial functions the Laplacian has the form

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\Delta=-\partial_r^2 - \coth(r)\cdot \partial_r,&lt;/math&gt;

so that, as a function of ''r'', the zonal spherical function φ(''r'') must satisfy the [[ordinary differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\varphi^{\prime\prime} + \coth r\, \varphi^\prime = \alpha \, \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant α. The change of variables  ''t'' = sinh ''r''  transforms this equation into the [[hypergeometric differential equation]]. The general solution in terms of [[Legendre functions]] of complex index is given by&lt;ref name="harvnb|Dieudonné |1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bateman|Erdelyi|1953|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{| border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"
|&lt;math&gt;\varphi(r)=P_\rho(\cosh r) = {1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} (\cosh r + \sinh r \, \cos \theta)^\rho \, d\theta,&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where α = ρ(ρ+1). Further restrictions on ρ are imposed by boundedness and positive-definiteness of the zonal spherical function on ''G''.

There is yet another approach, due to Mogens Flensted-Jensen, which derives the properties of the zonal spherical functions on SL(2,'''R'''), including the Plancherel formula, from the corresponding results for SL(2,'''C'''), which are simple consequences of the Plancherel formula and Fourier inversion formula for '''R'''. This "method of descent" works more generally, allowing results for a real semisimple Lie group to be derived by descent from the corresponding results for its complexification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flensted-Jensen|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984|pages=489–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further directions==
*''The theory of zonal functions that are not necessarily positive-definite.'' These are given by the same formulas as above, but without restrictions on the complex parameter ''s'' or ρ. They correspond to non-unitary representations.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984" /&gt;
*[[Plancherel theorem for spherical functions|''Harish-Chandra's eigenfunction expansion and inversion formula for spherical functions]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1984|pp= 434–458}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important special case of his [[Plancherel theorem]] for real semisimple Lie groups.
*''The structure of the Hecke algebra''. Harish-Chandra and Godement proved that, as convolution algebras, there are natural isomorphisms between C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''K'' \ ''G'' / ''K'' ) and C&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'')&lt;sup&gt;''W''&lt;/sup&gt;, the subalgebra invariant under the Weyl group.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Godement|1952"/&gt; This is straightforward to establish for SL(2,'''R''').&lt;ref name="Lang1985" /&gt;
*''Spherical functions for [[Euclidean group|Euclidean motion groups]] and [[compact Lie group]]s''.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Helgason|1984"/&gt;
*''Spherical functions for [[p-adic]] Lie groups''. These were studied in depth by Satake and [[Ian G. Macdonald|Macdonald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Satake|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Macdonald|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study, and that of the associated Hecke algebras, was one of the first steps in the extensive representation theory of semisimple p-adic Lie groups, a key element in the [[Langlands program]].
