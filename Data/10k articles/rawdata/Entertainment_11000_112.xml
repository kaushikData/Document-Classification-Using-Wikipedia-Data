The [[Olympic Games ceremony#Opening|opening ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympic Games]] took place on the evening of Friday 27 July 2012 in the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]], [[London]]. As mandated by the [[Olympic Charter]], the proceedings combined the formal ceremonial opening of this international sporting event (including welcoming speeches, hoisting of the flags and the parade of athletes) with an artistic spectacle to showcase the host nation's culture.  The 2012 Games were formally opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. The spectacle was entitled '''''Isles of Wonder'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Isles of Wonder |url=http://olympicopeningceremony.tumblr.com/tagged/stage1 |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and directed by [[Academy Award]]-winning British film director [[Danny Boyle]].

Prior to London 2012 there had been considerable apprehension about [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ability to stage an opening ceremony that could reach the standard set at the [[Beijing]] [[2008 Summer Olympics|Summer Games of 2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/in-depth/the-big-story/engineering-the-london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony/1013640.article|work=The Negineer|first=Stephen|last=Harris|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012 cannot match Beijing Olympics opening ceremony 'because of trade unions'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/2617980/London-2012-cannot-match-Beijing-Olympics-opening-ceremony-because-of-trade-unions.html|work=Daily Telegraph|first=Richard|last=Spencer|date=25 August 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Ways for London to Top the Beijing Olympics Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/philip-hepple/london-2012-olympics-five-ways-to-top-beijing-opening-ceremony_b_1282811.html?ref=uk|work=Huffington Post|first=Philip|last=Hepple|date=16 February 2012|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|2008 ceremony]] had been noted for its scale, extravagance and expense, hailed as the "greatest ever",&lt;ref name="AFPGreatestEver"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibNAUAq-kZNOy3LmO9HAI2cN-smg |title=Press hails 'greatest ever' Olympic opening show |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=9 August 2008 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511131508/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibNAUAq-kZNOy3LmO9HAI2cN-smg |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and had cost £65m. In contrast, London spent an estimated £27m (out of £80m budgeted for its four ceremonies), which was nevertheless about twice the original budget.&lt;ref name="Kortekaas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kortekaas |first=Vanessa |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4e49451e-1f76-11e1-9916-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1z2AgdaE5 |title=Cameron doubles budget for Olympic ceremonies |publisher=FT.com |date=5 December 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the London opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a "masterpiece" and "a love letter to Britain".&lt;ref name="Dawson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012: the experts' view of the Olympic opening ceremony|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/9434563/London-2012-the-experts-view-of-the-Olympic-opening-ceremony.html|work=Daily Telegraph|first1=Harvey|last1= Goldsmith| first2=Arlene|last2= Phillips| first3=David|last3= Quantick| first4=Mick|last4= Brown| first5=Mary|last5= Beard| date=29 July 2012|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCmedreact&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19025686 |date=28 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2012|title=Media reaction to London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's [[Industrial Revolution]], [[National Health Service]], literary heritage, popular music and [[Culture of the United Kingdom|culture]], and were noted for their vibrant [[storytelling]] and use of music.  Two shorter sections drew particular comment, involving a filmed [[cameo appearance]] of [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], and a live performance by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] joined by comedian [[Rowan Atkinson]]. These were widely ascribed to [[British humour|Britain's sense of humour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A "noisy, busy, witty, dizzying production": What the world thought of London 2012's opening ceremony|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/london-2012-what-the-world-thought-1178468|work=Daily Mirror|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony featured children and young people in most of its segments, reflecting the 'inspire a generation' aspiration of London's original [[London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|bid]] for the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case Study – LONDON 2012: How We Won The Bid|url=http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/assets/hlst/documents/olympic_sig/case_studies/CS10-How-we-Won-the-Bid.pdf|work=Higher Education Academy Oxford Brookes University|date=February 2010|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC released footage of the entire opening ceremony on 29 October 2012, edited by Danny Boyle and with background extras, along with more than seven hours of sporting highlights and the complete closing ceremony.&lt;ref name=BBCDVD&gt;[http://www.bbcshop.com/sport/london-2012-olympic-games-dvd/invt/bbcdvd3745/  ''London 2012 Olympic Games'', BBC Shop, London, October 2012].

==Preparations==
The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games ([[LOCOG]]) approached [[Danny Boyle]] to be the director of the ceremony in June 2010, and he immediately accepted.&lt;ref name=QNov2012&gt;{{Citation | last = Lynskey | first = Dorian |  title = Oblivion with Bells | journal = [[Q (magazine)|Q]] | volume = 318 | pages = 82–88 | date = January 2013|origyear=published November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danny Boyle to direct London 2012 opening ceremony|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7199.aspx|work=Gov.uk|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle explained that there had been four things that made him take the job: he was a big Olympics fan, he lived a mile from the Stadium and so felt invested in the area, his late father's birthday was on the ceremony's date, and he felt his 'Oscar clout' would enable him to push through what he wanted to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's journey from truck driving to the Olympics |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schoolreport/21741278 |work=BBC |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said it "felt weirdly more like a ... civic or national responsibility" to take the job.&lt;ref name=GDBCotP&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle: champion of the people |first=Jonathan |last=Freedland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/09/danny-boyle-queen-olympics-film |newspaper=The Guardian |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle acknowledged that the extravagance of the 2008 opening ceremony was an impossible act to follow — "you can't get bigger than Beijing" — and that this realisation had in fact liberated his team creatively. He said "..obviously I'm not going to try and build on Beijing, because how could you? We can't, and you wouldn't want to, so we're going back to the beginning. We're going to try and give the impression that we're rethinking and restarting, because they've (''opening ceremonies'') escalated since Los Angeles in 1984. They've tried to top themselves each time and you can't do that after Beijing."&lt;ref name=DBTO&gt;{{cite news |title=How Danny Boyle followed up 'Slumdog Millionaire' |first=Dave |last=Calhoun|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/film/how-danny-boyle-followed-up-slumdog-millionaire-1 |work=Time Out |accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GDBF&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympics opening ceremony: Danny Boyle credits late father for inspiration |first=Owen |last=Gibson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony-danny-boyle-father |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beijing's budget had been £65m, whereas London's final budget was £27m, which was twice the original provision.&lt;ref name="Kortekaas"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012: Isles of Wonder theme for Olympic ceremony |first1=Jane |last=Mower|first2=Michael|last2=Hirst |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16747032 |publisher=BBC News |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London stadium had the same number of seats as [[Beijing National Stadium|Beijing's]], but was half the size; this intimacy of scale meant that Boyle felt he could achieve something personal and connecting.&lt;ref name=DBTO/&gt;&lt;ref name="DB&amp;FCBvid"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvPRnMS88ns|work=Liverpool Hope University|title=Danny Boyle and Frank Cottrell Boyce - Words of Wonder|first1=Danny |last1=Boyle|first2=Frank | last2=Cottrell Boyce|date=10 October 2012|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The different sections of the ceremony were designed to reflect aspects of British history and culture, with the title ''Isles of Wonder'' partly inspired by [[Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]'' (particularly Caliban's 'Be not afeard' speech&lt;ref name="IoWDT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/olympicsvideo/9044505/London-2012-Olympics-Shakespeares-Caliban-the-inspiration-for-Isles-of-Wonder-opening-ceremony.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|title=London 2012 Olympics: Shakespeare's Caliban the inspiration for 'Isles of Wonder' opening ceremony|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and partly by the [[G. K. Chesterton]] aphorism: "The world shall perish not for lack of wonders, but for lack of wonder."&lt;ref name="DB&amp;FCBvid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GdnFCB"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jul/29/frank-cottrell-boyce-olympics-opening-ceremony?CMP=twt_gu|newspaper=The Guardian|title=The night we saw our mad, fantastical dreams come true|first=Frank | last=Cottrell Boyce|date=29 July 2012|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010, Boyle started brainstorming ideas with designer [[Mark Tildesley (production designer)|Mark Tildesley]], writer [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] and costume designer [[Suttirat Anne Larlarb]]. They considered "what was essentially British", with the non-British Larlarb able to offer a view of what the world thought Britain meant. Cottrell Boyce had given Boyle a copy of ''[[Pandaemonium (history book)|Pandaemonium]]'', (named after the capital of Hell in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'') by [[Humphrey Jennings]], which collated contemporary reports from the [[industrial revolution]].&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="GdnFCB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jennings&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/06/pandaemonium-humphrey-jennings-review |title=Pandæmonium by Humphrey Jennings – review The book behind the Olympic opening ceremony |first=Nicholas| last=Lezard|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=20 October 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had become traditional during the opening ceremony to 'produce' the [[Olympic symbols#The Rings|Olympic rings]] in a spectacular manner. Cottrell Boyce commented "Danny had a very clear idea that in the first 15 minutes you had to have a great, startling image that could go around the world; it had to climax with something that made people go 'Oh my God!'".  Boyle decided that "the journey from the pastoral to the industrial, ending with the forging of the Olympic rings" would be that image.&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;

The ten distinct chapters on which the team started work were gradually compressed into three principal movements: the violent transition from 'Green and Pleasant Land' to the 'Pandemonium' of industrial revolution, a salute to the NHS and children's literature, and a celebration of pop culture, technology and the digital revolution.&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;

{{quote box|quote="At some point in their histories, most nations experience a revolution that changes everything about them. The United Kingdom had a revolution that changed the whole of human existence.

In 1709 [[Abraham Darby I|Abraham Darby]] smelted iron in a blast furnace, using [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. And so began the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Out of [[Coalbrookdale|Abraham's Shropshire furnace]] flowed molten metal. Out of his genius flowed the mills, looms, engines, weapons, railways, ships, cities, conflicts and prosperity that built the world we live in.

In November 1990 another Briton sparked another revolution - equally far-reaching - a revolution we're still experiencing. The digital revolution was sparked by [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s amazing gift to the world - the [[World Wide Web]]. This, he said, is for everyone.

We welcome you to an Olympic Opening Ceremony for everyone. A ceremony that celebrates the creativity, eccentricity, daring and openness of the British genius by harnessing the genius, creativity, eccentricity, daring and openness of modern London.

You'll hear the words of our great poets - [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[William Blake|Blake]] and [[John Milton|Milton]]. You'll hear the glorious noise of our unrivalled pop culture. You'll see characters from our great children's literature - [[Peter Pan]] and [[Captain Hook]], [[Mary Poppins]], [[Voldemort]], [[Cruella de Vil]]. You'll see ordinary families and extraordinary athletes. Dancing nurses, singing children and amazing special effects.

But we hope, too, that through all the noise and excitement that you will glimpse a single golden thread of purpose - the idea of [[Jerusalem (hymn)|Jerusalem]] - of a better world, the world of real freedom and true equality, a world that can be built through the prosperity of industry, through the caring nation that built the welfare state, through the joyous energy of popular culture, through the dream of universal communication.  A belief that we can build Jerusalem.  And that it will be for everyone."|source=Danny Boyle, in the ceremony programme.&lt;ref name=Intro&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's intro on Olympics programme |url=http://www.awardsdaily.com/blog/2012/07/27/danny-boyles-intro-on-olympics-programme/ |publisher=Awards Daily |first=Ryan|last=Adams|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|width=25%|align=right}}

When Boyle returned to work on the ceremony in the spring of 2011 he asked [[Rick Smith (Underworld)|Rick Smith]] of [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], with whom he had worked on several film projects as well as his [[Frankenstein (2011 play)|theatrical production]] of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'', to be the musical director.&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="baltin1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Underworld Named Music Directors of 2012 Olympics|first=Steve |last=Baltin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/underworld-named-music-directors-of-2012-olympics-20111208 |work=Rolling Stone |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the team moved to the [[Three Mills]] studio complex in east London, where a 4x4 metre scale model of the stadium was built. For security reasons, a single CGI-assisted version of the ceremony was kept on editor Sascha Dhillon's laptop; anyone needing it had to come to the studio.&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;

The cast included professional performers and 7,500 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Volunteers |work= London 2012|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/General/01/30/27/74/OOCVolunteers_Neutral.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle considered the volunteers to be "the most valuable commodity of all". In November 2011 they auditioned at Three Mills, and rehearsals began in earnest in spring 2012 at an open-air site at [[Dagenham]] (the abandoned [[Ford]] plant), often in foul weather. Although key contributors had to sign non-disclosure agreements and some elements were codenamed, Boyle placed immense trust in the volunteers by asking them simply to "save the surprise" and not leak any information.&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=GDBCotP/&gt; Further volunteers were recruited to help with security and marshalling, and to support the technical crew.&lt;ref name=GDBF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle hails 15,000 Olympics opening ceremony volunteers |first1=Wesley |last=Johnson|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/danny-boyle-hails-15000-olympics-opening-ceremony-volunteers-7982152.html |work=The Independent |date=27 January 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks before the ceremony, [[Mark Rylance]], who was to have taken a leading part, pulled out after a family bereavement and was replaced by [[Kenneth Branagh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Young British athletes light cauldron at Olympics Opening Ceremony |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/olympics/906568-young-british-athletes-light-cauldron-at-olympics-opening-ceremony#ixzz226AYmCK1 |newspaper=Metro |first=Julian|last=Shea|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenneth Branagh recalls the opening ceremony of London 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/dec/23/kenneth-branagh-danny-boyle-olympics |newspaper=The Observer|first=Kenneth|last=Branagh|date=23 December 2012 |accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle gave significant emphasis to the London 2012 theme 'inspire a generation' and devised a programme relying heavily on children and young people, and built around themes that would relate to the young.  25 schools in the six original East London host boroughs were used to recruit child volunteers for the performance, and 170 sixth formers (16–18-year-olds), between them speaking more than 50 languages, were recruited from their colleges.

On 12 June 2012 at a press conference, Boyle had promised a huge set of rural [[Great Britain|Britain]], which was to include a [[village cricket]] team, farm animals, a model of [[Glastonbury Tor]], as well as a [[maypole]] and a rain-producing cloud. His intention was to represent the rural and urban [[landscape]] of Britain. The design was to include a mosh pit at each end of the set, one with people celebrating a [[rock festival]] and the other the [[The Proms|Last Night of the Proms]]. Boyle promised a ceremony with which everyone would feel involved; he said, "I hope it will reveal how peculiar and contrary we are – and how there's also, I hope, a warmth about us". Some of the set was designed with real grass turf and soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic opening ceremony will recreate countryside with real animals |first=Owen |last=Gibson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012 opening ceremony promises spectacle and surprises |first=Charlotte |last=Higgins |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jun/12/london-2012-opening-ceremony-spectacle?intcmp=239 |newspaper=The Guardian |date=12 June 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of animals (40 sheep, 12 horses, 3 cows, 2 goats, 10 chickens, 10 ducks, 9 geese and 3 sheep dogs, looked after by 34 animal handlers) drew some criticism from [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)]]. Boyle, who was being advised by the [[RSPCA]], assured PETA that the animals would be well cared for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012 Olympics: Campaigners fear for opening ceremony animals |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/9375479/London-2012-Olympics-Campaigners-fear-for-opening-ceremony-animals.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the press conference, much commentary in the UK Press was negative and attracted "hundreds of comments online completely supporting...the view that the opening ceremony would be a disaster."&lt;ref name=moonbook/&gt;

The overwhelming majority of the music used was British. The team worked next door to the office of the musical director for the closing ceremony, [[David Arnold]], and so hearing each other's music there was a scramble to claim a particular song first.&lt;ref name=QAug2012&gt;{{Citation |  title = It's the Rock and Roll Olympics! | journal = [[Q (magazine)|Q]] | volume = 315 | pages = 82–88 | date = October 2013|origyear=published August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.R. Rahman]], who worked with Boyle on ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and ''[[127 Hours]]'', composed a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] song 'Nimma Nimma' to showcase [[India–United Kingdom relations|Indian influence in the UK]], according to Boyle's wishes. More Indian music was also scheduled for inclusion in the medley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AR Rahman's punjabi track to rock Olympics inaugural |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-30/news-and-interviews/32483335_1_london-olympics-olympics-opening-ceremony-punjabi |newspaper=The Times of India |first=AR| last=Reshmi|date=30 June 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul McCartney]] was to be the ceremony's closing act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2012: Olympics: Paul McCartney closes London's opening ceremony|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-33747_162-57481790/2012-olympics-paul-mccartney-closes-londons-opening-ceremony/|date=27 July 2012|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe|Sebastian Coe]] was instrumental in asking the Queen to take part, responding positively when Boyle first pitched the ''Happy and Glorious'' film sequence featuring the Queen.  Boyle suggested that the Queen be played either a lookalike, or by a world-class actress such as [[Helen Mirren]], in a location to double as Buckingham Palace.  Coe asked [[Princess Anne]], a [[List of members of the International Olympic Committee|British member of the IOC]] and [[LOCOG]], what she thought, and she told him to ask the Queen.  Coe presented the idea to the Queen's Deputy Private Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Queen'', documentary film, first broadcast on ITV on 17 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyle was surprised to hear that the Queen would be happy to play herself, and wanted a speaking part.&lt;ref name=GDBCotP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180214/London-Olympics-2012-Gary-Connery-played-Queen-opening-ceremony.html|title='Secret agent' in the coup that made the Queen a global TV comedy star.|date=29 July 2012|work=[[Mail on Sunday]]|accessdate=29 July 2012|first=Lise|last=Hand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming took place in late March 2012, and ''Happy and Glorious'' was produced by the BBC, as was the opening film sequence ''Journey along the Thames''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19018666|title=How James Bond whisked the Queen to the Olympics|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=19 October 2012|first=Nicolas|last=Brown|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes were still being made to the programme in the final days before the ceremony:  a [[BMX]] bike section was dropped due to time constraints, and the 'Pandemonium' and 'Thanks..Tim' sections were edited down.&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt; In 2016 Boyle recounted how he had come under pressure from junior minister Jeremy Hunt to cut back the NHS section, which he had saved only by threatening to resign and take the volunteers with him.

Two full dress and technical rehearsals took place in the Olympic stadium, on 23 and 25 July, in front of an audience of 60,000 comprising volunteers, cast members' families, competition winners, and others connected to the Games. Boyle asked them not to 'spoil the surprise' (#savethesurprise) for the billions who would watch on the Friday night.&lt;ref name="GdnFCB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2178089/London-2012-Olympics-opening-ceremony-Fans-rehearsal-ordered-save-surprise.html|title=Don't spoil the surprise! 60,000 fans watch Olympic opening ceremony rehearsal - but are sworn to secrecy by organisers |date=24 July 2012|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=25 November 2012|first=Martin|last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.podium.ac.uk/news/view/906/apply-now-for-free-london-2012-olympic-games-opening-ceremony-rehearsal-tickets|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717185055/http://www.podium.ac.uk/news/view/906/apply-now-for-free-london-2012-olympic-games-opening-ceremony-rehearsal-tickets|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 July 2012|title=Apply now for free London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony rehearsal tickets|work=Podium.ac.uk|date=16 July 2012|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prologue===
[[File:2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony (18).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Scene before the ceremony commenced, representing rural Britain]]
At exactly 20:12 (8:12 pm) the [[Red Arrows]] performed a flypast over the [[Olympic Stadium (London)|Olympic Stadium]] and then over the concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]].&lt;ref name="flypast"&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012: Red Arrows Perform Stunning Fly-By Before Olympic Opening Ceremony |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/07/27/london-2012-red-arrows-olympics_n_1711429.html |work=Huffington Post |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concert featured artists selected to represent the four nations of the United Kingdom: [[Duran Duran]], [[Stereophonics]], [[Snow Patrol]] and [[Paolo Nutini]].&lt;ref name="hydeshow"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hyde Park show kicks off Olympics |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19014489 |work=BBC News |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning the stadium contained a rural scene including the model of [[Glastonbury Tor]], a model village and a water wheel, replete with live animals (removed shortly before the ceremony began), and actors portraying working villagers, football and cricket players.

[[Frank Turner]] performed three songs ("Sailor's Boots", "Wessex Boy" and "[[I Still Believe (Frank Turner song)|I Still Believe]]") on the model of [[Glastonbury Tor]], joined by [[Emily Barker]], [[Ben Marwood]] and Jim Lockey, as well as his regular backing band the Sleeping Souls.&lt;ref name="frankturner"&gt;{{cite news |title=THE BEST OF 2012: AN OLYMPIC STORY BY FRANK TURNER! |url=http://www.rocksound.tv/blog/article/the-event-that-shall-not-be-named-an-olympic-story-by-frank-turner |work=Rock Sound |first=Frank|last=Turner|date=27 December 2012 |accessdate=8 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London Symphony Orchestra|LSO]] On Track (an orchestra of 80 young musicians from ten East London boroughs together with 20 LSO members) then performed [[Edward Elgar]]'s "[[Enigma Variations#Variation IX (Adagio) "Nimrod"|Nimrod]]" from the ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', accompanied by extracts from the [[BBC Radio]] ''[[Shipping Forecast]]'', and maritime images on the big screens, while the audience held up blue sheeting to simulate the sight of the ocean. This performance celebrated Britain's maritime heritage and geographical "isles" status.

===Countdown (21:00–21:04 BST)===
The ceremony began at 9pm after a one-minute '60 to 1' countdown film made up of shots of numbers, such as those on house doors, street nameplates, London buses and market labels.

[[File:Bradley Wiggins 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.jpg|thumb|left|The [[2012 Tour de France]] winner [[Bradley Wiggins]] opening the ceremony]]

A two-minute film ''Journey along the Thames'', directed by Boyle and produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]], opened the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle's Olympic opening ceremony: madcap, surreal and moving |first=Owen |last=Gibson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony?newsfeed=true |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the sound of "Surf Solar" by [[Fuck Buttons]], it followed the [[River Thames]] from its [[Thames Head|source]] to the heart of London, juxtaposing images of contemporary British life with pastoral shots and flashes of scenes from the stadium. The characters Ratty, Mole and Toad from ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' were briefly seen, as was a '[[Monty Python]] hand' pointing towards London on umbrellas, and an [[InterCity 125]] train passing the Olympic rings as [[crop circle]]s in a field. At [[Battersea Power Station]] a [[Pink Floyd pigs|Pink Floyd pig]] was flying between the towers; the clock sound from another Pink Floyd song "[[Time (Pink Floyd song)|Time]]" was heard passing [[Big Ben#Tower|Big Ben]]. The soundtrack included clips from the theme tune of ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', "[[London Calling (song)|London Calling]]" by [[The Clash]], and the [[Sex Pistols]]' "[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]" as the film followed the route of the band's infamous cruise down the River [[Thames]] during the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]].&lt;ref name="xan"&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony – as it happened |first=Xan |last=Brooks |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/jul/27/london-2012-olympics-opening-ceremony-live |newspaper=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nmeplaylist&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympics Opening Ceremony – The Playlist |first=Luke |last=Lewis |url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=1&amp;title=olympics_opening_ceremony_playlist&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |newspaper=NME |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After lifting to an aerial view of [[East London]] mirroring the title sequence of the BBC soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', to the sound of the drum beats from [[EastEnders theme tune|the closing theme]], the film flashed down through the [[Thames Barrier]], into Bow Creek, and then below surface through a [[London Underground]] train and station, historic footage of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[Thames Tunnel]], and through the [[Rotherhithe Tunnel]]. It then switched to a sequence filmed outside the stadium shortly before the ceremony, superimposed with posters from previous Summer Olympics (all of them except [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris]], [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Berlin]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles]], and [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta]]), to a recording of "[[Map Of The Problematique]]" by [[Muse (band)|Muse]]. This ended with a live shot of three cast members holding the posters for the 2012 competition.

There was then a 10-second countdown in the stadium, with children holding clusters of [[balloon]]s that burst simultaneously (although one set failed to burst), with the audience shouting out the numbers.

[[Bradley Wiggins]], who had won the [[2012 Tour de France|Tour de France]] five days earlier, opened the ceremony by ringing the [[Olympic Bell]] that hung at one end of the stadium.  Four [[weather balloon|upper-atmosphere balloons]] were released, each expected to carry a set of Olympic rings and a camera up to the mid-[[stratosphere]].

The depiction of rural life already in the arena was billed as "a reminder and a promise of a once and future better life". Youth choirs began [[a cappella]] performances of the informal anthems of the four nations of the UK: "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]" (for [[England]], sung by a live choir in the stadium and beginning with a solo from eleven-year-old Humphrey Keeper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180850/London-2012-Olympics-The-unlikely-stories-opening-ceremonys-surprise-stars.html |title=London 2012 Olympics: The unlikely stories of opening ceremony's surprise stars &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |date=30 July 2012 |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), "[[Danny Boy]]" (from the [[Giant's Causeway]] in [[Northern Ireland]]), "[[Flower of Scotland]]" (from [[Edinburgh Castle]] in [[Scotland]]), and "[[Cwm Rhondda|Bread of Heaven]]" (from [[Rhossili|Rhossili Beach]] in [[Wales]] – sung in English).&lt;ref name="koreen"&gt;{{cite news|title=London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony live |first=Eric |last=Koreen |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/07/27/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremonies-live/ |newspaper=The National Post |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120806010159/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2012/07/27/london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremonies-live/ |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were inter-cut with footage of notable [[Rugby Union|Rugby Union Home Nations]]' [[Try|tries]], England's winning [[drop goal]] from the [[2003 Rugby World Cup Final]], and live shots from the stadium.

As the last choir performance concluded, vintage [[London General Omnibus Company]] [[stagecoach]]es entered, carrying businessmen and early [[Business magnate|industrialist]]s in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Morning dress|dress]] and [[top hat]]s, led by [[Kenneth Branagh]] as [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel]]. The 50 men stepped down from the carriages and [[Surveying|surveyed the land]] approvingly. After walking onto the Glastonbury Tor, Brunel delivered [[Caliban]]'s "Be not afeard" speech, reflecting Boyle's introduction to the ceremony in the programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danny Boyle Welcomes The World To London |first=Danny |last=Boyle |url=http://descrier.co.uk/uk/2012/07/london-2012-danny-boyle-welcomes-the-world-to-london/ |newspaper=The Descrier |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and signifying an aspiration of new industry or a new era in Britain.  This anticipated the next section of the ceremony.

===Pandemonium (21:09–21:25)===
This section encapsulated British economic and social development from rural economy through the [[Industrial Revolution]] to the 1960s.

Proceedings were suddenly interrupted by a loud shout, recorded by volunteers during the rehearsals, followed by drumming (the pre-recorded drumming amplified by 965 cast members drumming on inverted household buckets and bins),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Volunteering for the greatest show on earth |url=http://www.ism.org/blog/article/volunteering_for_the_greatest_show_on_earth |publisher=Incorporated Society of Musicians |first=Laura|last=Hollands|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; led by [[Evelyn Glennie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evelyn Glennie on the Olympics Opening Ceremony |url=http://tomtommag.com/2013/02/evelyn-glennie-on-the-olympics-opening-ceremony/|publisher=Tom Tom Magazine |date=14 February 2013|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-tonne oak tree on top of the Glastonbury Tor lifted, and industrial workers emerged from both the Tor's brightly lit interior and the entrances to the stadium, to swell the cast to a total of 2,500 volunteers.&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt; So began what Boyle had called the "biggest scene change in theatre history" and something he had been advised against attempting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Among those dark satanic mills|url=http://www.sean.co.uk/a/london2012-opening-ceremony.shtm|first=Sean|last=McManus|accessdate=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]'s "[[And I Will Kiss]]" began to play, as the cast rolled away the grass and other rural props.  Seven smoking [[smoke stack|chimney stacks]] with accompanying [[steeplejack]]s rose from the ground, along with other industrial machinery: five [[beam engine]]s, six looms, a crucible and a water wheel (one of the few items left from the rural scene). Boyle said that this section celebrated the "tremendous potential" afforded by the advancements of the [[Victorian era]].&lt;ref name="koreen"/&gt;   It also included a [[Moment of silence|minute's silence]] in remembrance of the loss of life of both [[World war|World Wars]], featuring British '[[Tommy Atkins|Tommies]]' and shots of [[Remembrance poppy|poppies]], during which the names of the [[Accrington Pals]] were shown on the stadium screens. Unprompted, members of the audience stood in respect during this segment.&lt;ref name=DVDcomm&gt;Danny Boyle and Frank Cottrell Boyce, audio commentary track to the BBC DVD of the opening ceremony&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Unpredictable and inventive as the British themselves, this was the People's Opening Ceremony| url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/london-2012-opening-ceremony-opinion-1176668 |publisher=[[Daily Mirror]]|first=Brian|last=Reade|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volunteers paraded around the stadium representing some of the groups that had changed the face of Britain: the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|woman's suffrage]] movement, the [[Jarrow Crusade]], the first [[Caribbean]] immigrants arriving in 1948 on board the ''[[MV Empire Windrush#West Indian immigrants|Empire Windrush]]'', a 1970s DJ float, the Nostalgia Steel Band, and [[The Beatles]] as they appeared on the cover of ''[[Sgt.

[[File:KOCIS Korea London Olympics TeamKorea 09 (7683501986).jpg|thumb|upright|The Olympic rings]]
Workers began [[casting]] an iron ring.  As the noise level and tension built, driven by the relentless rhythm of the music and the drumming, participants mimed repetitive mechanical movements associated with industrial processes such as [[loom|weaving]]. Four glowing orange rings gradually began to be carried high above the stadium toward its centre on overhead wires, and then the ring seemingly being cast and forged in the arena began to lift.  The five rings converged, still glowing and accompanied by steam and firework effects to give the impression that they were of hot metal.  When the five rings formed [[Olympic symbols#Symbol|the Olympic symbol]] above the stadium, they ignited and rained fire in silver and gold.  The image of the Olympic rings in flame became the iconic image of the ceremony, reproduced in newspapers and web stories around the world.&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DTPand"&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012: How the might of the industrial revolution was created on stage|first=Patrick |last=Sawer |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012/9435386/London-2012-How-the-might-of-the-industrial-revolution-was-created-on-stage.html |work=Daily Telegraph |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Happy and Glorious (21:25–21:35)===
A short film directed by Boyle and produced by the [[BBC]], called ''Happy and Glorious'' (after a line in the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem]]), featured the character [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]], played by current Bond actor [[Daniel Craig]], entering the front gate of [[Buckingham Palace]] in a [[Hackney carriage|London black cab]].  His entrance (accompanied by an arrangement of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s '[[Arrival of the Queen of Sheba|The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba]]') is noticed by Brazilian children (a nod to [[Rio de Janeiro]], which was to be the next [[2016 Summer Olympics|summer Games]] host city) in the throne room. Bond escorted [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] (who played herself, acknowledging Bond with the words, "Good evening, Mr Bond") out of the building and into a waiting [[AgustaWestland AW139]] helicopter. The film followed the helicopter across London, with shots of a cheering crowd on [[The Mall, London|The Mall]], [[Nelson's Column]], the [[Palace of Westminster]] with an animated [[Statue of Winston Churchill, Parliament Square|Winston Churchill statue]] in [[Parliament Square]], and of the Thames past the [[London Eye]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]], the financial district [[City of London]].  The helicopter then passed through [[Tower Bridge]], accompanied by the [[Dambusters March]]. The film finished with Bond and the Queen apparently jumping from a real helicopter live above the stadium, accompanied by the "[[James Bond Theme]]".&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc120712jb"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nic |last=Brown |publisher=BBC News |title=How James Bond whisked the Queen to the Olympics |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19018666 |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], along with [[Jacques Rogge|Rogge]], were then introduced to the audience.  The Queen was wearing the same dress as in the film, as if she had just arrived with James Bond.

For the scenes with the helicopter, the Queen was doubled by actress [[Julia McKenzie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Guardian |title= London 2012: Danny Boyle thrills audiences with inventive Olympics opening ceremony |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/london-2012-boyle-olympics-opening-ceremony | first1=Tracy| first2= Owen | last1=McVeigh| last2=Gibson|date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the parachute jump by [[BASE jumping|BASE jumper]] and [[stunt performer|stuntman]] [[Gary Connery]] wearing a dress, hat, jewellery and with a handbag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title= London 2012 remembered: Gary Connery loved his Olympic skydiving entrance for opening ceremony |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/10205509/London-2012-remembered-Gary-Connery-loved-his-Olympic-skydiving-entrance-for-opening-cermony.html |date=27 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |title= London 2012: 'Amazing' to be Queen's stunt double |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19031022 |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond was played by [[Mark Sutton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=BBC News |title= Olympic Bond parachutist Mark Sutton killed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23707434 |date=15 August 2014 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The helicopter had flown to the stadium from [[Stapleford Aerodrome]] in Essex, piloted by [[Marc Wolff]].

The Union Flag was then raised by members of the [[British Armed Forces]], while the first and third verses of the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem]] were performed ''[[a cappella]]'' by the [[Kaos Signing Choir for Deaf and Hearing Children]].&lt;ref name="koreen"/&gt;

===Second to the right, and straight on till morning (21:35–21:47)===
The first part of this sequence celebrated the [[National Health Service]] ("the institution which more than any other unites our nation", according to the programme), which had been founded in the year of the previous London Games in 1948.  Music was by [[Mike Oldfield]]. 600 dancers, all of whom were NHS staff, along with 1,200 volunteers recruited from British hospitals, entered along with children on 320 hospital beds, some of which functioned as [[trampoline]]s.  They started a short jive routine. Watching from the tor were specially invited hospital staff and nine child patients from [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]].&lt;ref name="GOSH"&gt;{{cite news |title=Incredible honour for Great Ormond Street Hospital at London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony |url=http://www.gosh.org/gen/news/latest-news/2012-archive/incredible-honour-for-great-ormond-street-hospital-at-london-2012-olympic-opening-ceremony/ |publisher=Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blankets on the beds illuminated and the beds were arranged to depict a child's face with a smile and a tear (the Hospital Children's Charity's logo).  The acronym 'GOSH' then changed into the initials 'NHS', turning into the shape of a crescent moon as the children were hushed to sleep and read books by the nurses.

The sequence then moved on to celebrate British children's literature. [[J. K. Rowling]] began by reading from [[James Matthew Barrie|J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up|Peter Pan]]'' (whose copyright was given to Great Ormond Street Hospital). The [[Child Catcher]] appeared amongst the children, followed by giant puppet representations of villains from British children's literature: [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|the Queen of Hearts]], [[Captain Hook]], [[Cruella de Vil]] and [[Lord Voldemort]].  Minutes later, 32 women playing [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] descended with their umbrellas, as the villains deflated and the actors resumed dancing.&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt; The music for this sequence included partially rearranged sections from ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (with a giant set of [[tubular bells]] at the rear of the stage), ''[[Tubular Bells III]]'' and, after the villains had been driven away by the Mary Poppins characters, ''[[In Dulci Jubilo / On Horseback|In Dulci Jubilo]]''.&lt;ref name="dizzee"&gt;{{cite news |title=Dizzee Rascal, Emeli Sandé, Mike Oldfield perform at Olympics opening ceremony |url=http://www.nme.com/news/dizzee-rascal/65184 |newspaper=NME |date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this performance the children in pyjamas jumped up and down on their brightly lit beds, creating a memorable image amid the darkness of the stadium.

The sequence concluded with a pale, gigantic baby's head, with a rippling sheet for its body, in the centre of the arena.  This celebrated the Scottish pioneers of [[obstetric ultrasonography|obstetric ultrasound imaging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Oxford Companion to the London 2012 Opening Ceremony |url=http://blog.oup.com/2012/08/oxford-companion-london-2012-opening-ceremony/ |work=Oxford University Press Blog|first=Alice|last=Northover|date=12 August 2012|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interlude (21:47–21:52)===
[[Simon Rattle]] was then introduced to conduct the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in a performance of [[Vangelis]]'s "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Chariots of Fire]]", as a tribute to the British film industry. [[Rowan Atkinson]] appeared as a [[Mr. Bean]]-like character, comically playing a repeated note on a [[synthesizer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bumbling Mr. Bean brings down the house as he leads orchestra in hilarious rendition of Chariots Of Fire|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180052/Mr-Bean-Olympic-Opening-Rowan-Atkinson-brings-house-leads-orchestra-hilarious-rendition.html|newspaper=Daily Mail|first=Jill|last=Reilly|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then lapsed into a filmed dream sequence in which he joined the runners from the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', beating them in their iconic run along West Sands at [[St Andrews]] by riding in a car, rejoining the race and tripping the front runner. Danny Boyle later explained: "It wasn't actually Mr. Bean. Strictly speaking, the name of his character was Derek".&lt;ref name=raphael&gt;{{Cite book

===Frankie and June say...thanks Tim (21:52–22:09)===

The [[Great Storm of 1987|1987 "don't worry about a hurricane"]] weather forecast by [[Michael Fish]] was shown on the big screens as rain suddenly poured on the house, followed by "[[Push the Button (Sugababes song)|Push the Button]]", by [[Sugababes]]. In the centre of the arena the sides of another house, three times larger, were used as screens to show clips from various TV programmes, music videos and films, including ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (June is named for its protagonist), as well as ''[[Gregory's Girl]]'', ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'', ''[[The Snowman]]'', ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', [[Spain|Spanish]] TV show ''[[Cuéntame cómo pasó]]'', and Boyle's own ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic opening ceremony: Peter Bradshaw's review |first=Peter |last=Bradshaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony-review?newsfeed=true|newspaper=The Guardian| date=27 June 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large group of dancers, centred around Frankie and June (19-year-old Henrique Costa and 18-year-old Jasmine Breinburg) on a night out, performed to an assortment of British popular songs arranged broadly chronologically, beginning with "[[Going Underground]]" by [[The Jam]], suggesting a ride on the [[London Underground]]. During this track images of the Underground were projected onto the house and former London Mayor [[Ken Livingstone]] was briefly seen.  Throughout the sequence cast members were [[short message service|texting]] each other or placing [[social networking]] status updates on the [[Internet]]. Frankie and June first notice each other as a snippet from "[[Wonderful Tonight]]" by [[Eric Clapton]] plays, but when Frankie saw that June had dropped her phone on the Tube, he set off to return it (communicating using last number redial to her sister's phone).

[[File:This is for Everyone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s tweet, "This is for everyone"]]

An extended dance sequence followed, with songs including "[[My Generation]]" by [[The Who]], "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]" by the [[Rolling Stones]], "[[My Boy Lollipop]]" sung by [[Millie Small]], "[[All Day and All of the Night]]" by the [[Kinks]], "[[She Loves You]]" by the [[Beatles]] (with footage of the band performing the song), "[[Trampled Under Foot]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]], "[[Starman (song)|Starman]]" by [[David Bowie]], "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]" by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (during which the sound of the [[TARDIS]] from ''[[Doctor Who]]'' could be heard), "[[Pretty Vacant]]" by the [[Sex Pistols]] (during which dancers on power jumpers wearing large heads with [[Mohawk hairstyle]]s performed a [[Pogo (dance)|pogo]] dance, and the lyrics to the song were spelled out in LED lights around the stadium), "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]" by [[New Order (band)|New Order]], "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" by [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] (during which Frankie, asked by June for his name, replied by revealing one of the band's "Frankie say..." T-shirts), "[[Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)]]" by [[Soul II Soul]], "[[He's Gonna Step On You Again#Happy Mondays version|Step On]]" by [[Happy Mondays]], "[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]" by [[Eurythmics]], "[[Firestarter (The Prodigy song)|Firestarter]]" by [[The Prodigy]], and "[[Born Slippy .NUXX]]" by [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]], ending with the cast singing "[[I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles]]" as Frankie and June walked towards each other.  A sequence from the film ''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' was projected behind them; when they kissed, a montage of memorable kisses from film and real life was shown (including the lesbian kiss from ''[[Brookside]]'', which in some countries, including Saudi Arabia, then became the first lesbian kiss ever shown on [[Watershed (television)|pre-watershed]] television),&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt; while "[[Song 2]]" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]] was played. A live performance of "[[Bonkers (song)|Bonkers]]" by [[Dizzee Rascal]] followed, along with a further sequence in which all the cast (and ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' dancing duo [[Signature (dance group)|Signature]]) attend a party at June's house whilst [[Amy Winehouse]]'s "[[Valerie (The Zutons song)|Valerie]]", [[Muse (band)|Muse]]'s "[[Uprising (song)|Uprising]]", and [[Tinie Tempah]]'s "[[Pass Out (song)|Pass Out]]" played.&lt;ref name="dizzee"/&gt;

At the close the larger house was raised to reveal [[Tim Berners-Lee]] working at a [[NeXT Computer]], like the one on which he invented the [[World Wide Web]].  He [[Twitter|tweeted]] 'This is for everyone',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Berners-Lee, Tim|title=This is for everyone|url=https://twitter.com/timberners_lee/status/228960085672599552|publisher=Twitter|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; instantly spelled out in LED lights around the stadium.&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Friar&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Tim Berners-Lee stars in Olympics opening ceremony |first=Karen |last=Friar |url=http://www.zdnet.com/uk/sir-tim-berners-lee-stars-in-olympics-opening-ceremony-7000001744/ |newspaper=ZDNet |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme explained "Music connects us with each other and with the most important moments in our lives. One of the things that makes those connections possible is the World Wide Web". Boyle wanted to honour Berners-Lee for having made the World Wide Web free and available to everyone (hence the tweet), rather than seeking a commercial profit from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lunch with the FT: Tim Berners-Lee |first=Andrew |last=Edgecliffe-Johnson |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/b022ff6c-f673-11e1-9fff-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2NRakIIKj|newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations}}
[[File:2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations, Team GB.jpg|thumb|[[Team GB]] enters the [[2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations]] last]]

The Parade of Nations of athletes (drawn from the 10,490 competing) and officials from 204 nations (and also the "[[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Independent Olympic Athletes]]") was led, according to custom, by the [[Greece|Greek]] team, followed by other competing countries in [[alphabetical order]], and finally the host nation [[Team GB|Great Britain]].  Each of the 205 teams entered the stadium led by their flagbearer, accompanied by a child volunteer carrying a copper petal (later revealed to be part of the [[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron|cauldron]]) and a young woman carrying a sign with the country's name in English (and wearing a dress made from fabric printed with photos of people who had applied to be Olympic volunteers).&lt;ref name=MedGuide33&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/Publications/01/30/43/40/OPENINGCEREMONYGUIDE_English.pdf|title=London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Media Guide|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2012|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parade was accompanied by mainly British dance tracks and popular songs, including "[[Galvanize (song)|Galvanize]]" by [[Chemical Brothers]], "[[West End Girls]]" by [[Pet Shop Boys]], "[[Rolling in the Deep]]" by [[Adele]], "[[Stayin' Alive]]" by the [[Bee Gees]] and both "[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]" and "[[Beautiful Day]]" by Irish band [[U2]], with [[Team GB|Great Britain]] entering to [[David Bowie]]'s song "[["Heroes" (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]".&lt;ref name="koreen"/&gt;  Welsh [[drum and bass]] DJ [[High Contrast]] mixed and sequenced the music for the athletes' parade.&lt;ref name=QAug2012/&gt;

Music with a fast rhythm of 120 [[tempo|bpm]]&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt; was used in an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was reinforced by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion [[Confetti|small pieces of paper]] were dropped from a [[Westland Helicopters|Westland helicopter]], each piece representing one person on Earth.

Each nation's [[flag]] was planted on the Glastonbury Tor.

Once the athletes had gathered in the centre of the stadium, the [[Arctic Monkeys]] performed "[[I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor]]" and [[The Beatles]]' "[[Come Together]]", the latter whilst 75 cyclists circled the stadium with wings lit by [[LED]]s representing [[Peace symbol#The dove and olive branch|Doves of Peace]]. Doves were traditionally released at Olympic opening ceremonies, although real birds have not been used since 1992.  A single dove cyclist, his beak painted yellow in honour of [[Bradley Wiggins]], appeared to fly out of the stadium.&lt;ref name="arctic"&gt;{{cite news |title=What better way to end a great night than a sing-along?

===Let the Games Begin (00:07–00:24)===
[[File:Muhammed Ali receives the Olympic Flag at the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.JPG|thumb|left|[[Muhammad Ali]] receives the Olympic Flag]]The formal part of the ceremony was introduced by [[Sebastian Coe, Baron Coe|Sebastian Coe]], speaking from the Tor and surrounded by flags of the participating nations.  He welcomed the watching world to [[London]]. He expressed pride in being [[British people|British]] and part of the Olympic movement, and said that the Olympics "brings together the people of the world...to celebrate what is best about mankind".&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt;  He continued to speak of the "truth and drama" of sport, and then thanked Britain for "making all this possible". Rogge responded by thanking London, stating that it was the third time that London had held the Games, following [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], held at short notice when [[Rome]] was unable to do so (after a volcanic eruption), and [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] three years after the end of [[World War II]]. Rogge thanked the thousands of volunteers, to huge cheers. He announced that for the first time in Olympic history, every team had female participants. Rogge acknowledged the important role the UK had played as "the birthplace of modern sport", codifying its "fair play" ethos and building sport into the school curriculum.  He appealed to athletes to play fairly and be drug-free, according to the values of [[Pierre de Coubertin|Baron de Courbertin]], reminding them that they were role models who would "inspire a generation". After expressing these sentiments again briefly in French, he invited the Queen to open the Games.&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt;

The Queen declared the competition officially open, immediately followed by a [[trumpet]] fanfare based on a theme from ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' by [[Mike Oldfield]] and then a [[fireworks]] display.&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt; The 2012 ceremony was the second time the Queen had opened an Olympic Games, the first being the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]] in her capacity as [[Queen of Canada]]. It was also the first time any individual had opened a Summer Olympics twice (two more Olympiads had been opened on her behalf, with a further two Winter Games opened on her behalf).

The [[Olympic Flag]] was carried by eight people chosen from around the world to embody the Olympic values: [[Ban Ki-moon]] (as UN general secretary), [[Sally Becker]] (for courage), [[Doreen Lawrence]] (chosen for her "tireless thirst for justice"), [[Haile Gebrselassie]] (for his "fight against poverty"), [[Leymah Gbowee]] (as "a great peacemaker"), [[Shami Chakrabarti]] (for "her integrity"), [[Daniel Barenboim]] (for bringing "harmony in place of discord"), and [[Marina Silva]] (as UN Champion of the Earth).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.sports.yahoo.com/photos/olympic-flag-carried-daniel-barenboim-sally-becker-shami-photo-052852459--oly.html |title=The Olympic flag is carried by Daniel Barenboim, Sally Becker, Shami Chakrabati CBE, Leymah Gbowee, Haile Gebrselassie, Doreen Lawrence OBE, Ban Ki-moon and Marina Silva during the Opening Ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Summer Games at the Olympic Stadium in London, Saturday, July 28, 2012.

[[File:Olympic Cauldron after being lit at the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Heatherwick's Olympic Cauldron after being lit]]

This section was named after [[There Is a Light That Never Goes Out|a song]] by [[The Smiths]]. The [[motorboat]] driven by [[David Beckham]] arrived with the [[Olympic Flame]] via the [[Limehouse Cut]] and the [[Lee Navigation]]. [[Steve Redgrave]] lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the construction workers who had built the [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]]. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian to convey the Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Seven teenagers light Games' cauldron |first1=Kate |last1=Holton |first2=Neil |last2=Maidment |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2012/07/28/olympics-opening-ceremony-young-athletes-idINDEE86R00020120728 |agency=Reuters |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the team were athletes, and the seventh was a volunteer young ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012 remembered: the cauldron lighters|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/10203579/London-2012-remembered-the-cauldron-lighters.html|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|date=27 July 2013|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teenagers made a lap of the stadium, each carrying the torch in turn, while [[Alex Trimble]], lead singer of [[Two Door Cinema Club]], performed "[[Caliban's Dream]]"&lt;ref name="TDCC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Singer 'thought invite was dream' |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/singer-thought-invite-was-dream-16190962.html|newspaper=The Belfast Telegraph|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Dockhead Choir, [[Only Men Aloud]], Elizabeth Roberts, and Esme Smith. This had been written especially for the ceremony by [[Rick Smith (Underworld)|Rick Smith]] of [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]].&lt;ref name="TDCC"/&gt;

Each young athlete was greeted by their nominating Olympian (watched by 260 British medallists from previous summer and winter Games since London 1948) and presented with their own torch, which was then lit from the flame. They jogged through a corridor between assembled athletes to the centre of the stadium, where the 204&lt;ref name=Gdnind&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympic cauldron lit by sport stars of future| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/28/olympic-cauldron-lit-youngsters |work=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=10 December 2012 |quote=The independent athletes had a petal for the Athletes' Parade, but this was not attached to the cauldron.}}&lt;/ref&gt; copper petals (each inscribed with the name of the team it accompanied during the parade) were now seen in a circular formation attached to long pipes (the petals were to accompany each team home after the competition, as a souvenir).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic Cauldron|url=http://www.heatherwick.com/2012-olympic-cauldron/|publisher=Heatherwick Studio|accessdate=13 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217021742/http://www.heatherwick.com/2012-olympic-cauldron/|archive-date=17 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The young athletes lit some of the petals, and when the flame had spread to all of them, the pipes rose slowly from the floor of the stadium and converged to form the cauldron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cauldron Lighting Segment (Full)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei54TO1VBlM|publisher=Olympic YouTube Channel|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cauldron lighters were (''nominator in brackets''):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heatherwick Olympic cauldron lit by young hopefuls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19024475|publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron|The cauldron]] designed by [[Thomas Heatherwick]] was described as "one of the best-kept secrets of the opening ceremony": until this point, its design, location, and who would light it had not been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London 2012: Thomas Heatherwick, the designer behind the Olympic cauldron that stunned viewers |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012/9434325/London-2012-Thomas-Heatherwick-the-designer-behind-the-Olympic-cauldron-that-stunned-viewers.html|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|first=Roya|last=Nikkhah|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic cauldron represents peace says designer Heatherwick |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19028963|work=BBC|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Olympic cauldron built in 'Bond-style gadget workshop' says architect as organisers vow to make giant flame carbon neutral |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180217/Burning-green-Unique-design-Olympic-cauldron-help-make-carbon-neutral.html#ixzz21vsJPMna|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===And in the end (00:38–00:46)===
A flurry of spectacular fireworks accompanied by [[Pink Floyd]]'s song "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]" was supported by images of memorable Olympic victories shown on the big screens, with the stadium pixels showing [[Jesse Owens]] running.&lt;ref name=DVDcomm/&gt;  The climax of this section was a live view of the Olympic rings 34 kilometres (21 miles) above the Earth, transmitted from one of the balloons launched three and a half hours earlier. The sky was then lit by searchlights piercing the smoke (another iconic London image) from the fireworks, the [[ArcelorMittal Orbit|Orbit]] tower was illuminated.  [[Paul McCartney]] and his band performed the closing section of "[[The End (The Beatles song)|The End]]", and then "[[Hey Jude]]", with its chorus sung by the audience to close the ceremony at 00:46 BST.&lt;ref name="xan"/&gt;

The focus was mainly on [[British popular music|music of the 1960s onwards]], causing one [[Chinese people|Chinese]] journalist to ask: "Will this be the most rock and roll opening ceremony ever?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympics opening ceremony: the view from abroad|first=Alexandra |last=Topping |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympics-opening-ceremony-view-from-abroad?intcmp=239 |work=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rick Smith and [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]] composed pieces for the ceremony, including "[[And I Will Kiss]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Underworld - And I Will Kiss (Edit) (London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1jPRQOkuWw |publisher=YouTube |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; used during the 'Pandemonium' section, and "[[Caliban's Dream]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Underworld - Caliban's Dream (London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mec8GZkEpD4 |publisher=YouTube |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard during the lighting of the cauldron. These were favourably reviewed; in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Michael Hann wrote "Underworld ... had a bit of a triumph: the builds and fades they learned in the world of dance music lent the sometimes overwhelming visual spectacle a sense of structure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympic opening ceremony: the music, reviewed|first=Michael|last=Hann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/27/olympic-opening-ceremony-music?intcmp=239 |work=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Musical motifs were used to bind the ceremony programme together: for example, the 'whistling' theme first heard during the minute's silence embedded within "And I Will Kiss" returned frequently — behind the fury as the ring was being forged, emerging triumphant as the five rings came together, and again later as the main theme of 'Caliban's Dream' whilst the flame was paraded around the stadium.
[[File:London Olympics Opening Ceremony - Mike Oldfield.jpg|thumb|Mike Oldfield performing "[[Tubular Bells]]" at the opening ceremony]]
Bells were a theme of the opening day of the Olympics, starting at 8:12{{nbsp}}am with artist [[Martin Creed]]'s ''[[All the Bells|Work No. 1197: All the Bells]]'', when bells were rung across the UK including forty strikes of Big Ben.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bells toll across UK as Martin Creed's army of ringers welcome Olympics |first1=Severin| last1=Carrell| first2=Charlotte| last2=Higgins| url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/27/bells-toll-martin-creed-olympics?newsfeed=true|work=The Guardian |date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=30 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The sound of bells is the sound of England", Boyle had told volunteers during rehearsal.&lt;ref name="moonbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Moon | first1 = Russell| title = Days of Wonders | publisher = Oak House Partnership | year= 2012 | isbn = 978-095747310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the music for the ceremony contained 'bell' references, linking to the large bell forged for the ceremony and evoking bells as "the sound of freedom and peace".  Modified sequences based on the traditional British [[Ring of bells|eight-bell peal]] underlaid "And I Will Kiss" and carried through into the "[[Tubular Bells]]"/NHS section, with [[handbells]] and a tolling large bell featured on 'Caliban's Dream' and at key points in the ceremony. A handbell chime also played after the close, as the stadium emptied.

Boyle approached many of the artists personally, to see if they would be interested in performing, and he also flew to [[Barbados]] for an hour-long meeting with [[Mike Oldfield]]. A few turned him down, including [[Elvis Costello]] and [[David Bowie]],&lt;ref name=GDBCotP/&gt; and a well-known group Boyle has not named "wanted £20,000 and would not budge", and so they were not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='I almost quit Olympics over rooftop missiles': Danny Boyle's outrage over decision to mount weapons on east London tower blocks and how he persuaded the Queen to join in the fun |first=Amy| last=Raphael| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-2285926/Danny-Boyle-turning-knighthood-persuaded-Queen-join-Olympic-fun.html|work=The Daily Mail |date=3 March 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performing artists were paid a nominal £1 fee to make their contracts legally binding.&lt;ref name=QAug2012/&gt;

==Technical aspects==
The main loading of the stadium started on 10 May and took ten weeks of what was the wettest summer for a hundred years, posing considerable challenges.&lt;ref name=techvid&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0Z8pCTt1hE|title=Backstage at the London 2012 Olympic Ceremonies|work = Lsionline|date=12 September 2012|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19427139|title=Summer 'wettest in 100 years', Met Office figures show|date=30 August 2012|accessdate=15 March 2013|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dismantling the staging took just sixty hours.&lt;ref name=techvid/&gt;

The infield staging area was 2.5 metres high, and had to accommodate the elements revealed during the ceremony, such as the chimneys and beam engines from 'Pandemonium', and the [[2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron|cauldron]]. To ensure that it remained secret, the cauldron was code-named 'Betty', and installed and tested at night.&lt;ref name=techvid/&gt;

The stadium was rigged with a one million watt sound system and more than 500 speakers.&lt;ref name=MedGuide15&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/Publications/01/30/43/40/OPENINGCEREMONYGUIDE_English.pdf|title=London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Media Guide|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2012|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{convert|15000|sqm|acre}} of staging and 12,956 props were used,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Olympics ceremony: 27m UK viewers watched opening|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19026694|publisher=BBC News|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as {{convert|7346|sqm|acre}} of turf including crops.&lt;ref name=MedGuide21&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/mm/Document/Documents/Publications/01/30/43/40/OPENINGCEREMONYGUIDE_English.pdf|title=London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony Media Guide|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=1 August 2012|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

70,799&lt;ref name=MedGuide15/&gt; 25 centimetre (10 inch) pixel panels were placed around the stadium, including between every seat. Each panel connected to a central computer and was fitted with nine full-colour [[LED]] pixels by Tait Technology.&lt;ref name=techvid/&gt; These enabled images to be broadcast during the performance, such as of a 1960s [[go-go dancer]], a [[London Underground]] train, and a representation of the birth of the [[internet]]. The audience was also able to participate by waving the paddles to create a twinkling effect. These animations were designed by 59 Productions and the video animations were produced by Chinese company Crystal CG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Desmarais |first=Christina |url=http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/news/?NewsID=3372809 |title=HOW THE LONDON 2012 OLYMPICS OPENING CEREMONY AUDIENCE BECAME A GIANT TV SCREEN |publisher=Digitalartsonline.co.uk |date=30 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2D to 3D transformation and mapping of video content onto the panels were done by [[Avolites|Avolites Media]] [[media server]] consoles.&lt;ref name=TpITait&gt;{{cite web|title=Tait's Landscape Video System Engulfs Entire Olympic Stadium With Moving Images|url=http://www.tpimagazine.com/News/1511740/taits_landscape_video_system_engulfs_entire_olympic_stadium_with_moving_images.html|work=tpiMagazine.com|publisher=Total Production International|accessdate=23 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108024914/http://www.tpimagazine.com/News/1511740/taits_landscape_video_system_engulfs_entire_olympic_stadium_with_moving_images.html|archive-date=8 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LsiGreenInterview&gt;{{cite journal|title=Interview - Dave Green|journal=Lighting and Sound International|date=July 2013|page=82|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?PBID=8918c11d-2349-4b43-a6cc-a2fdecb2f2e2|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Carine06 - Olympic Stadium (3).jpg|thumb|At the technical rehearsal of the Opening Ceremony]]
Technical director Piers Shepperd masterminded the complex change from rural to industrial during 'Pandemonium'.&lt;ref name="DTPand"/&gt; The seven inflatable chimneys were made by Airworks, and varied in height (three were {{convert|22|m|ft|adj=on}}, two were {{convert|23|m|ft|adj=on}} and two were {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} high). They were made of soft fabric, with an outer layer of printed brick pattern.  Each contained four industrial fans at the base to inflate them, and a smoke machine near the top, and were hoisted into the air from the overhead rigs.&lt;ref name=techvid/&gt; Life-size [[beam engine]]s were constructed onstage by teams of stage hands and members of the Volunteer Staging Team.&lt;ref name="DTPand"/&gt;  At the climax of 'Pandemonium', in the [[Olympic symbols#Symbol|Olympic ring]] forging scene, amber lights lit in sequence created the illusion of a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on}} molten steel river, with pyrotechnic smoke and [[dry ice]] as steam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alice-azania |last=Jarvis |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2180814/London-2012-Olympics-opening-ceremony-How-magic-moments.html |title=How they made those magic moments: The secrets behind that jaw-dropping Olympic opening ceremony |work=Daily Mail |date=30 July 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original grass floor surface had been removed to reveal a giant stylised map of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Papworth |first=Andrew |url=http://www.huntspost.co.uk/news/latest-news/review_of_the_year_2012_july_september_1_1782551 |title=Review of the Year 2012: July-September|work=Hunts Post  |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working alongside the professional crew were over 800 volunteers; some were production arts students from British drama schools. Many had been working on the Olympic and Paralympic ceremonies since early 2012 at the [[Three Mills#Three Mills Studios|Three Mills Studios]] and [[Dagenham]] rehearsal sites, before moving to the Stadium on 16 June.

The thousands of cast were cued and co-ordinated by directions received through earphones ('in-ear monitors'), and adjustments were made during the performance: for example during Pandemonium extra volunteers were sent to make sure all the turf was cleared on time.  The earphones also carried a continuous electronic [[Metronome|metronomic]] four-beat to keep everyone walking and moving in time with the music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZlZZf8MKpM |title=Olympic Opening Ceremony Hidden Camera with performers in ear monitor|date=11 December 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 it was revealed that on the morning of the ceremony, Britain's surveillance headquarters [[GCHQ]] had detected a credible [[cyber attack]] threat that could have killed the lighting system in the stadium.  Counter-measures were taken, and in the afternoon contingency plans were discussed with government ministers at a meeting in the [[Cabinet Office]] briefing room. However, this attack never materialised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corera |first=Gordon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23195283|title=The 'cyber-attack' threat to London's Olympic ceremony|publisher=BBC News |date=8 July 2013 |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony was recorded by three separate broadcasters: the BBC, the [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] (directed by the Finnish state broadcaster [[YLE]] on behalf of the OBS), and by independent production company Done and Dusted, hired by LOCOG and working under Boyle's direction. This was the first time that an independent production company had been used for an Olympic ceremony.&lt;ref name=TYDandD/&gt;  This situation led to some tension, as Boyle wanted more artistic control and felt he was getting no co-operation from the OBS.&lt;ref name=Indycomm/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gdntension&gt;{{Cite news |title=Olympic opening ceremony: a feast of drama … and that's just the rehearsals |last1=Hopkins |first1=Nick|last2=Gibson|first2=Owen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/18/olympic-opening-ceremony-drama?newsfeed=true |newspaper=The Guardian |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GdnDVD&gt;{{Cite news |title=Your next box set: London 2012 Olympic Games |last=Moss |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/nov/01/box-set-london-2012-olympic-games |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 November 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised the OBS coverage during his commentary for the BBC DVD.&lt;ref name=DVDcomm/&gt; In addition, the BBC filmed some of the pre-recorded parts of the ceremony.&lt;ref name=Indycomm/&gt; The filming was directed for television by [[Hamish Hamilton (director)|Hamish Hamilton]], who described it as "easily the most difficult job of my life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2013/tvcraft/special-award|title=Television Craft - Special Award in 2013|work=BAFTA |date=29 April 2013|accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC released footage of the entire ceremony on 29 October 2012, edited by Danny Boyle and with background extras, filling more than one disc of a five [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray disc]] set, which also contained more than seven hours of sporting highlights as well as the complete closing ceremony.&lt;ref name=BBCDVD/&gt;  A 'BBC commentary-free' option for the opening ceremony is available on the DVD, as well as a commentary track by Danny Boyle and [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]].&lt;ref name=GdnDVD/&gt;  In contrast the [[NBC]] DVD only has highlights of the opening ceremony.

''[[The Times]]'' described the ceremony as "a masterpiece", with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' saying it was "brilliant, breathtaking, bonkers and utterly British".&lt;ref name=BBCmedreact/&gt; The [[BBC]]'s chief sports writer [[Tom Fordyce]] called it "eccentric" and "tongue-in-cheek", saying "no-one expected ... it would be quite so gloriously daft, so cynicism-squashingly charming and, well, so much pinch-yourself fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Olympics 2012 opening ceremony: 'A Britain as never seen before' |first=Tom |last=Fordyce |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/19022429 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after the ceremony [[Jonathan Freedland]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "Boyle's spectacular, so beautifully executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, but also because it had something to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London 2012: we've glimpsed another kind of Britain, so let's fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/10/london-2012-glimpsed-britain-fight?INTCMP=SRCH|first=Jonathan|last=Freedland|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Jackie Kay]] commented that "it seemed that Boyle had invented a new kind of opening ceremony, a concept ceremony, one that embraces big ideas as passionately as it does technical flamboyancy".&lt;ref name=Gdnrevs&gt;{{cite news |title=London 2012: Opening ceremony – reviews  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/jul/29/london-2012-opening-ceremony-reviews |work=[[The Observer]] |date=29 July 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Stage'' said that "Danny Boyle's spectacular and moving Olympics Opening Ceremony was undoubtedly the theatrical highlight of 2012".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Stage 100 2013: numbers 3 to 6  |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/2013/01/the-stage-100-2013-numbers-3-to-6/|work=The Stage |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Daily praised a "glorious pandemonium devoted to London's thriving, chaotic energy ... deliberately revelling in the chaos of Britain's free society and popular culture".  France's ''[[Le Figaro]]'' said it reflected "the best contributions that Britain has given to the world ... its sense of humour, its music, and of course sport".  The [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] said it was a "rocking, rollicking, sometimes quiet and brooding ceremony."  Qatar's ''[[The Peninsula (newspaper)|The Peninsula]]'' said London did a "spectacular job" making the ceremony a "memorable event".&lt;ref name=BBCmedreact/&gt;

In an end of the year review, British magazine ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' said "It could all have been so different. As the London 2012 Summer Olympics approached, the tide of scepticism seemed almost irreversible. There was the heavy-handed sponsorship, the draconian security, the ticketing problems, the ballooning budget, and the lurking fear that the Opening Ceremony might be, in director Danny Boyle's pungent description, 'shite'. It took less than four hours on the night of Friday 27 July to turn the whole country around.  Not only was the ceremony demonstrably ''not'' shite, it was the most surprising, moving, spectacular cultural event this country had ever seen...modern Britain, in all its berserk, multi-faceted glory."&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;

The writer of the ceremony, [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]], said: "People around us thought it might need defending, so I was told to do press the next morning. I was completely surprised ''[by the positive response]''.  A lot of people were surprised.  But I don't think Danny was surprised.  Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling that it was going to be anything but amazing.  And he was right."&lt;ref name=QNov2012/&gt;

In December 2012 the culture critic of ''[[The Guardian]]'' picked the ceremony as "best art event of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/dec/05/olympic-opening-ceremony-2012-highlight?intcmp=122|title=The Olympics opening ceremony: my cultural highlight of 2012|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 December 2012|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A British public survey by Samsung voted it the second most inspiring television moment of all time, second only to the [[Apollo 11|1969 moon landing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/olympic-opening-ceremony-most-inspiring-2012-television-moment-8425244.html|title=Olympic opening ceremony 'most inspiring' 2012 television moment|last=Dex|first=Robert|work=[[The Independent]] |date=19 December 2012|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Digital Spy survey of more than 25,000 overwhelmingly voted the ceremony as the entertainment highlight of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a446824/olympics-opening-ceremony-named-digital-spy-readers-2012-highlight.html|title=Olympics Opening Ceremony named Digital Spy readers' 2012 highlight|last=Nissim|first=Mayer|work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=22 December 2012|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony was the second most-mentioned entertainment event on the internet in 2012, with just over 6 million mentions, coming second to the [[Grammy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2012/12/19/the-web-votes-the-most-important-stories-of-201/|title=The Web Votes: The Most Important Stories of 2012|last=Konrad|first=Alex|work=[[Forbes]] |date=19 December 2012|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC reported that it was the most requested item from 2012 on its iPlayer on-demand service, with 3.3 million requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21177665|title=Olympic opening ceremony most requested on iPlayer|work=[[BBC]] |date=24 January 2013|accessdate=24 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyle was offered a knighthood in late 2012, but turned it down, saying "I'm very proud to be an equal citizen and I think that's what the Opening Ceremony was actually about."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/honours-refusenik-danny-boyle-joins-illustrious-roll-call-of-rebels-8421000.html|title=Honours refusenik Danny Boyle joins illustrious roll call of rebels...|last=Legg|first=James|work=[[The Independent]] |date=16 December 2012|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The ceremony was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new mood in the United Kingdom: it "had barely finished before it had become a byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's ceremony was hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country.&lt;ref name=GDBCotP/&gt; Boyle himself says this was the most important thing he took away from the Olympic experience: "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you."

Business leaders also took inspiration from the event, admiring its risk-taking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= What Every CEO Can Learn From The Olympics' Wacky Opening Ceremony  |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1844301/what-every-ceo-can-learn-olympics%E2%80%99-wacky-opening-ceremony |publisher=Fast Company|first=Adam|last=Hanft|date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and creative freedom, as well as the trust placed in and loyalty inspired from the workers and volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Team Danny Boyle: 5 Lessons in Leadership  |url=http://intentionalworkplace.com/2012/08/02/team-danny-boyle-5-lessons-in-leadership/|publisher=The Intentional workplace|first=Louise|last=Altman|date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013 the BBC's Head of Drama Ben Stephenson told an audience of writers, commissioners and producers that he "wanted them to seek inspiration from the opening ceremony of the London Olympics" which, he said, "had scale and brilliance and, above all, had succeeded not in spite of its Britishness but because of its Britishness, delighting viewers here and around the world by rooting itself in the authentic stories and spirit of these islands."&lt;ref name=GDBCotP/&gt; [[Steve Coogan]] told [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] that he felt it was "like the emperor's new clothes in reverse ... it made irony and postmodernism feel tired and past its sell-by date", and [[Russell T Davies]] told Boyce: "It changed my idea of the possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= We created the hope of a better Britain. But what remains of the Olympic magic?  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/13/olympic-opening-ceremony-britain-cottrell-boyce|publisher=The Guardian|first=Frank Cottrell|last=Boyce|date=13 July 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the [[2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony]] at [[Sochi]], Russia, Owen Gibson of ''The Guardian'' observed that with his 'complex, intimate snapshot of "who we were, who we are and who we wish to be"', Boyle 'rewrote the rule book for opening ceremonies'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sochi 2014 opening ceremony: Ernst delivers disco-led paean to the past  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/07/sochi-2014-opening-ceremony-ernst-disco-paean-to-past|publisher=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Gibson|date=7 February 2014 |accessdate= 8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current President of ACE is [[Stephen E. Rivkin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Eddie Awards==
Beginning in 1950, the ACE held an annual dinner to honor the film editing [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominees. When the [[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] (NATAS) created a film editing category, the ACE invited them to the dinner as well.

In 1962, the ACE began giving its own awards. The awards and nominations are typically covered in [[entertainment industry]] newspapers and journals such as ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Magazine==
{{main|Cinemaeditor}}

Since 1951, the ACE has published the quarterly magazine ''[[Cinemaeditor]]''. It began as an in-house publication, but grew to 5,000 subscribers in 1963. In the early 1990s the magazine collapsed into a four-page newsletter. In 1994, Jack Tucker was appointed as the Editor the publication into today's magazine. Walter Fernandez, Jr. leads the magazine's team, with publications committee chair [[Edgar Burcksen]].

==ACE Student Editing Competition==
The American Cinema Editors also holds an annual student competition, awarding one student editor for editing a set of video [[dailies]] for a dramatic scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://americancinemaeditors.org/student-editing-competition/
| title=ACE Student Editing Competition
| publisher=American Cinema Editors
| accessdate=2018-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three finalists are guests at the annual ACE Eddie Awards in February. Applications are accepted through October and cost US$125. The competition is limited to the first 100 students only.

==The ''Gunsmoke'' footage==
The ACE Store is the source of the [[dailies]] used at most film schools today. The scene is from a 1958 episode of the TV series ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. It is available only to instructors of film editing classes. The video tape is called ''FILM EDITING: Interpretation and Value'' and includes three different edits of the scene.

'''Andreas Karavis''' is a non-existent [[Greece|Greek]] [[poet]] created by [[Canadians|Canadian]] poet [[David Solway]].

On October 1999, ''[[Books in Canada]]'' published an article entitled "Modern Homer" about a supposedly newly discovered Greek poet Andreas Karavis, with an interview, a photograph, and an essay by David Solway. In the piece, Solway claimed that he had hunted the reclusive fisherman-poet for years until he had finally met him in 1991, and that he had begun to translate his poems in 1993.

Solway claimed that Karavis had been born in 1932 in [[Chania]], [[Crete]], and that he lived on the [[Dodecanese]] [[island]] of [[Lipsi]]. After Karavis' education on [[Serifos]], disrupted by [[World War II]] and the [[civil war]], he became a [[fisherman]] and settled on [[Amorgos]], selling his books of poetry in local harbors. Amongst his supposed collections was ''White Poems'' (1965). After having laboured in obscurity for the greater part of his life, he had become one of the country's most acclaimed and admired writers with the 1989 publication of ''The Dream Masters''.

In reality, Karavis was the creation of Solway. However, other people joined the joke. In the next issue there was a letter from a self-declared expert on Greek poetry, "Fred Reed". He did not dispute Karavis' existence, but claimed that Karavis was in fact a [[smuggler]], not a fisherman, and that the first poems were nothing else that pirated translations from a group of expatriate Canadians.

Later, press attaché Yiorgos Chouliaris of the Greek embassy, wrote to Solway to congratulate him for "imaginative effort". Solway convinced him to join the hoax.

The fame of Karavis spread. There were reports of international conferences about his poetry in [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Coimbra]]. Solway met a writer who claimed that he had admired Karavis for many years, and someone who said that Karavis was more worthy of the [[Nobel Prize]] than more famous Greek poets. He even received two postcards signed with Karavis' name.

In 2000, Chouliaris was one of the hosts at the launch of a translation of Karavis' poems, ''Saracen Island: The Poetry of Andreas Karavis''. Although Solway claimed to be the translator, the work was entirely his creation. A man who claimed to be Karavis appeared, wearing a fisherman's cap and speaking something that at least sounded like Greek.

Soon afterward Matthew Hayes, a columnist of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' in [[Toronto]], wrote an article entitled ''Karavis: Greek god of poetry or literary hoax?''. In a 2001 issue of ''Lingua Franca'' magazine, Solway finally confessed in public that he had invented the poet, and that the man who had appeared at the book launch, purporting to be Karavis,  was actually Solway's [[dentist]].

Solway has said that he had created Karavis as an "[[alter ego]] and [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]]" to gain new inspiration for his poetry.

'''Augusto Umberto Gentile''', also known as '''Augusto Alberto Gentile''' (September 11, 1891 - March 18, 1932) was a pianist and composer of [[Argentine]] [[tango]]s.  Gentile was born in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] and signed his middle name "Alberto" because he preferred it to "Umberto".  Around 1913, he began to compose tangos.  As a performer, he recorded some tangos on piano solo for the "Telephone" label in 1918, and he was also artistic director for that label.  He worked with lyricists such as [[Pascual Contursi]] and [[Juan Andrés Caruso]].  Gentile died in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

'''''Bang 3''''' is the second&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20087-nobody/|title=Chief Keef: Nobody Album Review - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=2 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[studio album]] by [[United States|American]] rapper [[Chief Keef]]. The [[LP album|LP]] is a double album itself, serving as the third installment of Chief Keef's ''Bang'' trilogy. It was leaked online on August 1, 2015. Soon after the album was released officially on [[iTunes]] on August 3, 2015, through the label FilmOn Music. The second part of the album was released on September 18, 2015, as well as the double disc being available for purchase in stores. The album features [[guest appearance]]s from [[ASAP Rocky]], [[Mac Miller]], [[Lil B]] and Jenn Em.

Since the album was originally slated for a December  2013 release, it was delayed several times, with numerous release dates falling through or never materializing. After Keef was dropped from Interscope, who owns the album name and its songs, it was unknown whether or not the album would ever be released.

In June 2015, Keef announced that the album would be released July 3, by FilmOnTV and Greek Billionaire [[Alki David]]. The album was then pushed back to July 14, with "Ain't Missing You," the first post-Interscope single, released on the July 3, instead. However, the album was once again pushed back to August 18, until being released 2 weeks early on August 1. This was followed by Chief Keef announcing the second part of the album being released on August 18, only to be delayed again to September 18, while instead only releasing the single "Bouncin".

==Background==
''Bang 3'' was originally planned to be released on December 25, 2013, as a mixtape. However, in February 2014, Chief's manager, Peeda Pan, announced the project would be developed into a full-length album.&lt;ref name=MTVmarch31&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleischer|first=Adam|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1725121/chief-keef-bang-3-june-10/|title=Chief Keef’s Bang 3 Gets A Release Date… Now Stop Asking|publisher=''MTV''|date=March 31, 2014|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late February it was announced Chief Keef was planning to release the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Bang 4'', as a "preview" for ''Bang 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kramer|first=Kyle|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/02/chief-keef-is-releasing-bang-4-the-ep-bfo-b3-as-a-preview-to-bang-3|title=Chief Keef Is Releasing "Bang 4" as A Preview to "Bang 3" Because He's Living In The Future|publisher=''Complex''|date=February 27, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as ''Bang 3'', kept getting pushed back, so did ''Bang 4'', until November when Chief Keef continued to go through with his plan of releasing the EP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keef|first=Chief|url=https://twitter.com/ChiefKeef/status/529721776306405376|title=Finna drop some off B4 The Ep B4 B3|publisher=''Twitter''|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Chief was still signed with [[Interscope Records]], the label's executive, Larry Jackson, announced a June 10, 2014 release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilah|first=Rose|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/chief-keef-announces-bang-3-release-date-update-new-date-announced-news.8915.html|title=Chief Keef Announces "Bang 3" Release Date [Update: New Date Announced]|publisher=''Hot New Hip Hop''|date=March 31, 2014|accessdate=November 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was later delayed to a September 30 release, and following another push back after that, Chief was dropped from [[Interscope Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeGroot|first=Joey|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/13024/20141021/chief-keef-dropped-interscope-records-plans-release-own-album.htm|title=Chief Keef Dropped from Interscope Records, Plans to Release Album on His Own|publisher=''Music Times''|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is despite Jackson previously stating that he and the label were behind Keef and ''Bang 3''.&lt;ref name=BillboardFeb2014&gt;{{cite web|last=Krishnamurthy|first=Sowmya|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/5908374/chief-keef-talks-rehab-bang-3-album-learning-how-to-surf|title=Chief Keef Talks Rehab, 'Bang 3' Album &amp; Learning How to Surf|publisher=''Billboard''|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''[[AllHipHop]]'' report details Interscope's disinterest in releasing a follow-up album to ''[[Finally Rich]]''.&lt;ref name=Keefdropped&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Houston|url=http://allhiphop.com/2014/10/21/exclusive-chief-keef-dropped-by-interscope-records/|title=Exclusive: Chief Keef Dropped By Interscope Records|publisher=''AllHipHop''|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous source for the report details, "Keef’s team tried to have formal meetings but nothing moved."&lt;ref name=Keefdropped/&gt; Legal issues that Keef dealt with seemed to cause Interscope to "subtly disassociate" with Keef.&lt;ref name=Keefdropped/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramirez|first=Erika|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-juice/6289381/chief-keef-confirms-being-dropped-from-interscope-records-on|title=Chief Keef Confirms Being Dropped From Interscope Records on Twitter|publisher=''Billboard''|date=October 22, 2014|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, Chief Keef maintained that he would release the album himself, and after confirming his departure from the label, [[Twitter|tweeted]] "One-hundred percent of everything goes to me now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=John|url=http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/is-this-the-end-for-chief-keef-111|title=Is This the End for Chief Keef?|publisher=''Ebony''|date=October 23, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Keef confirmed that he would be planning a Christmas release for the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keef|first=Chief|url=https://twitter.com/ChiefKeef/status/524612082378211329|title=Fuck that Everything that was Supposed to drop Still dropping 10days left for #BFTD2and Christmas #B3 SituationGang!|publisher=''Twitter''|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Caitlin|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/14052/20141031/stream-chief-keef-back-from-the-dead-2-mixtape-tracklist-gucci-mane-interscope.htm|title=Stream Chief Keef's 'Back From The Dead 2' Mixtape [TRACKLIST]|publisher=''Music Times''|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once again, the album's release did not materialize.&lt;ref name=TBArelease&gt;{{cite web|last=DeGroot|first=Joey|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/21820/20141226/chief-keef-fredo-santana-drop-new-track-bodies-ground-listen.htm|title=Chief Keef, Fredo Santana Drop New Track 'Bodies on the Ground' [LISTEN]|publisher=''Music Times''|date=December 26, 2014|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2015, Chief Keef organized a promotional concert for ''Bang 3'', which also served as a charity concert to help out the victims of a drive-by shooting that left Keef's fellow Glo Gang member, Capo, as well as 13-month year old Dillan Harris dead. Due to outstanding warrants, Keef performed via hologram. However, during the concert, [[Hammond, Indiana|Hammond]] police shut down the concert.

On August 1, 2015, 2 songs from the album featuring [[A$AP Rocky]] and [[Mac Miller]] were leaked. Soon after the album was released for free as a mixtape on the website Hot New Hip Hop and other mixtape sites. The next day, the mixtape was removed from Hot New Hip Hop at the request of Alki David, and was made available through FilmOnTV for purchase. The official version was then made available for purchase on iTunes on August 3, 2015. Later that day Keef via social media, Keef told fans Bang 3 was a double disc album. On August 8 an official release date for the second part of Bang 3 was set for August 18 which was the original release date for the album. However, come August 18 the album was delayed to September 18th with a pre-order made available. The album would then be released on September 18 with a physical edition available which included both discs and advertising 3 bonus tracks (T'd, 'Ignorant' and 'Told Ya'). Due to a technical error, the 3 bonus tracks were not featured on the physical edition and as compensation an employee of FilmOn provided those with proof of purchase 2 extra tracks ('Off The Tooka/Tooka' and 'Real Money') as well as the original advertised 3 bonus tracks.

Bang 3 was met with a generally positive  reception, critics argued that it's his most polished work since [[Finally Rich]]. "The higher, clearer production values are most immediately noticeable—this is the crispest-sounding Keef release since 2012's ''Finally Rich—''and its well-ironed-out song structures." said [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]. [[HipHopDX]] argued, "''Bang 3'' isn’t precisely a return to ''Finally Rich'' form as that version of Sosa may be long gone but,  it is the closest he’s gotten in his continuing journey of wide-ranging sonic discovery. It isn’t Chief Keef at his best or even his most interesting; it’s Keef at his most pliable." Critics also praised Chief Keef's growth and experimentation with Pitchfork saying, "it's the work of a mature rapper and songwriter, putting the skills he developed over several years spent branching out stylistically to good use". As of January 2017 Bang 3 Sold around 63,000 copies which includes 22,000 copies of streams in the US. HipHopDX weighed in that, "Singing To The Cheese,” eschews normal time in favor of Keef’s abstract arrangements without unraveling; moving forward while also moving sideways. It’s a reminder of everything Chief Keef has been and everything he can be." [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] also added, "Getting dropped from [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] might be the best thing that ever happened to Chief Keef, or at least the best thing for his music (his recent partnership with [[FilmOn]] remains a mysterious business move that hasn't seemed to confine him creatively whatsoever). It’s hard to imagine a major-Keef getting away with the chorus on the massive, self-produced  opener “Pee Pee’d”.

==Singles==
On July 3, 2015, "Ain't Missing You", a tribute to Keef's late cousin and fellow Glo Gang member, Big Glo was released. The song featured Jenn Em and the video was released by FilmOnTV.

'''Caden Manson''' is the co-founder and director of [[Big Art Group]], an experimental theatre ensemble based in New York City. Dedicated to advancing the boundaries of contemporary theatre, Manson has expanded the field of contemporary performance through his use of digital media, creative interdisciplinary collaborations, and teaching. Manson is the Editor in Chief and co-curator at Contemporary Performance Network, a community organizing platform and social network dedicated to facilitating collaboration among artists, presenters, scholars and festivals.&lt;ref name="contemporaryperformance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporaryperformance.org/|publisher=contemporaryperformance.org|title=Contemporary Performance Network - A Resource for Performing Artists, Scholars and Audiences.|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is the co-Artistic director of the Special Effects festival, an experimental performance festival which premiered in January 2014 &lt;ref name="contemporaryperformance2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://contemporaryperformance.com/sfx/|publisher=contemporaryperformance.com|title=Special Effects &amp;#8211; Contemporary Performance Festival|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
A Texas native, Manson attended University of Texas at Austin, where he earned awards in acting and a Presidential scholarship that supported his Bachelor of Arts in Theatre. Manson moved to New York in 1995, and in 1999, along with Jemma Nelson, he founded [[Big Art Group]]. Initially a small underground performance group, the company has since burgeoned into an internationally appreciated and critically acclaimed ensemble.&lt;ref name="bigartgroup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigartgroup.com/about/big-art-group/|publisher=bigartgroup.com|title=Big Art Group &amp;#124; History|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Direction==
Manson has been responsible for the direction, co-creation, set and media design of [[Big Art Group]]'s productions since its initial original work, CLEARCUT Catastrophe in 1999.  Since CLEARCUT, the company has produced 22 original works with repeated tours. The People, a serial production adaptively rewritten for each city it is presented in has enjoyed success in Polverigi, Halle, San Francisco, Portland, and most recently New York.&lt;ref name="exeuntmagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exeuntmagazine.com/features/with-democracy-and-theater-for-all/|publisher=exeuntmagazine.com|title=With Democracy and Theater for All - Exeunt Magazine|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson's work is characterized by its intense visual spectacle, savvy blending of video and live acting to produce self-reflective commentary on its own genre, and technical sophistication. At its birth, Manson envisioned Big Art Group as a means to, 'aggressively attack the boundaries of performance and art through its experimentation with structure, medium and process."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/19/theater/theater-review-the-freedom-and-limits-of-fudging-boundaries.html|publisher=nytimes.com|title=THEATER REVIEW; The Freedom (and Limits) of Fudging Boundaries - The New York Times|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Big Art Group's unique integration of live acting and video, known as Real Time Film, was pioneered and titled by Manson himself, and has remained a characteristic element of the artist's work, revisited and developed in new productions.&lt;ref name="bigartgroup2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigartgroup.com/work/|publisher=bigartgroup.com|title=Big Art Group &amp;#124; Work|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of Big Art Group's work blends elements of popular culture and current events with scenes inspired by literature or Classical mythology.&lt;ref name="americanrealness"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanrealness.com/portfolio-type/big-art-group/|publisher=americanrealness.com|title=Big Art Group &amp;#124; American Realness|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Manson's work seeks to actively engage and challenge its audience and to confront expectations constructed by traditional theatre:

"Unlike traditional theatrical performance, Big Art Group's extended mediated performances reposition viewers into active editors, challenging audience members to problem-solve complex issues of sexuality, race, narrative and truth as a theatrical mirror to the process of navigation through contemporary society."&lt;ref name="bigartgroup3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigartgroup.com/work/sos/|publisher=bigartgroup.com|title=Big Art Group &amp;#124; SOS|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with the village voice, Manson remarked on the political quality of Big Art's serial project, The People, and on his broader goal of encouraging popular engagement in art, politics, and thought: "For me, culture is a space for critical thought," says Manson. "We're not really making a show, we're making a space for people to think."&lt;ref name="villagevoice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-04-13/theater/big-art-group-celebrates-10-years-of-multimedia-weird/full/|publisher=villagevoice.com|title=Big Art Group Celebrates 10 Years of Multimedia Weird &amp;#124; Village Voice|accessdate=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5420">The '''cinema of Gabon''' has had an uneven history. Though President [[Omar Bongo]] and his wife, [[Josephine Bongo]], encouraged filmmaking in the 1970s, there was a twenty-year hiatus until filmmaking started to grow again in the new millenium.

==History==
French companies made documentaries in colonial Gabon from 1936 onwards.&lt;ref name="Yates2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas A. Yates|title=Historical Dictionary of Gabon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbZGDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA119|date=28 December 2017|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=978-1-5381-1012-6|pages=119–|chapter=Cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After independence, Philippe Mory, Gabon's first professionally trained actor, organized the Compagnie Cinematographique du Gabon in 1962, and helped produce ''[[The Cage (1963 film)|The Cage]]'', a feature film entered into the [[1963 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Yates2017"/&gt; The national television company supported films like Pierre-Marie Dong's ''Carrefour humain'' (1969) and Mory's ''Les tams-tams se sont tus'' (1972).&lt;ref name="Diawara1992"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diawara|first=Manthia|authorlink=Manthia Diawara|title=African Cinema: Politics &amp; Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lIjrlnC0bmsC&amp;pg=PA62|year=1992|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-20707-X|pages=62–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Gabon had only eight cinemas, President [[Omar Bongo]] and his wife [[Joséphine Bongo]] took a direct personal interest in film.&lt;ref name="Armes2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Armes|title=African Filmmaking: North and South of the Sahara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qr3h5X_9B34C&amp;pg=PA46|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21898-5|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President built a 400-seat cinema in his presidential palace, and in 1975 founded the Centre National Du Cinéma with Mory as director. He also founded a production company, Les Films Gabonais.&lt;ref name="Yates2017"/&gt; Gabon saw nine films from six directors in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Armes2006"/&gt; Les Films Gabonais produced several films co-directed by Dong and based on the writings of the presidential couple: ''Obali'' (1976) and ''Ayouma'' (1977) were based on plays examining social themes by Joséphine Bongo,&lt;ref name="Akyeampong2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=David E.

==Contemporary cinema==
After two decades of relative inactivity, Gabonese filmmaking started to rise again in the new millenium. Charles Mensah at the Centre National du Cinéma Gabonais (CENACI) had introduced new policies to restructure Gabonese cinema in the early 1990s .&lt;ref&gt;Imunga Ivanga, [http://africultures.com/the-revival-of-gabonese-cinema-5495/ The revival of Gabonese cinema], ''Revue Africultures'', Vol. 36, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imunga Ivanga]] started making short films in the 1990s, and his feature film ''Dôlè'' (2000) was the first Gabonese feature film for two decades.&lt;ref name="Armes2008-78"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Armes|title=Dictionary of African Filmmakers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88sTRTl6yKwC&amp;pg=PA78|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-35116-2|pages=78-9|chapter=Ivanga, Imunga}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won festival awards at [[Carthage Film Festival|Carthage]], [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] and [[Milan Film Festival|Milan]].&lt;ref name="Hickendorff2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Annelies Hickendorff|title=Gabon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g99xBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|year=2014|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-554-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henri-Joseph Koumba Bididi made a number of short films, and the 2001 feature film ''The Elephant's Balls''.&lt;ref name="Armes2008-85"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Armes|title=Dictionary of African Filmmakers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88sTRTl6yKwC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-35116-2|page=85|chapter=Koumba-Bibidi, Henri-Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivunga and Mory collaborated on ''L'Ombre de Liberty'' (2006), and in 2014 Ivunga was made general director of the national television network, [[Gabon Television]].&lt;ref name="Yates2017-254"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas A.

The [[Film|cinema]] of [[South Africa]] refers to the films and [[film industry]] of the nation of South Africa. Many foreign films have been produced about South Africa (usually involving race relations). 

One South African film to achieve international acclaim was ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy]]'' in 1980, set in the [[Kalahari]]. This is about how life in a traditional community of Bushmen is changed when a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] bottle, thrown out of an aeroplane, suddenly lands from the sky. The late [[Jamie Uys]], who wrote and directed ''The Gods Must Be Crazy'', also had success overseas in the 1970s with his films ''Funny People'' and ''Funny People II'', similar to the TV series ''[[Candid Camera]]'' in the United States. [[Leon Schuster]]'s ''You Must Be Joking!'' films are in the same genre, and hugely popular among South Africans.

Another high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was ''[[District 9]]''. Directed by [[Neill Blomkamp]], a native South African, and produced by [[Peter Jackson]], the action/science-fiction film depicts a sub-class of alien refugees forced to live in the slums of Johannesburg in what many saw as a creative allegory for apartheid. The film was a critical and commercial success worldwide, and was nominated for Best Picture at the [[82nd Academy Awards]].

Other notable films are ''[[Tsotsi]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Foreign Language Film]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]] in 2006 as well as ''[[U-Carmen eKhayelitsha]]'', which won the [[Golden Bear]] at the 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

The first film studio in South Africa, [[Killarney Film Studios]], was established in 1915 in [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/topic/history-south-african-film-industry-timeline-1895-2003|title=A History of the South African Film Industry timeline 1895-2003|last=Anonymous|date=2011-03-21|work=South African History Online|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s and 1920s, many South African films were made in or around [[Durban]]. These films often made use of the dramatic scenery available in rural [[KwaZulu-Natal]], particularly the [[Drakensberg]] region. KwaZulu-Natal also served as the appropriate location for historical films such as ''De Voortrekkers'' (1916) and ''The Symbol of Sacrifice'' (1918). American filmmaker [[Lorimer Johnston]] directed several films in the area in the late 1910s which starred American actresses [[Edna Flugrath]] and Caroline Frances Cooke. Despite the participation of Johnson, Flugrath and Cooke, these were South African productions featuring local actors and stories.

==Sound Era==
''[[Sarie Marais#Sarie Marais .281931.29: the first South African film with sound|Sarie Marais]]'', the first Afrikaans-language sound film, was released in 1931. Subsequent sound releases such as ''Die Wildsboudjie'' (1948), a 1949 ''Sarie Marais'' remake, and ''[[Daar doer in die bosveld]]'' (1950) continued to cater primarily to white, Afrikaans-speaking audiences.

The 1950s saw an increased use of South African locations and talent by international filmmakers. British co-productions like ''[[Coast of Skeletons]]'' (1956) and American co-productions like ''[[The Cape Town Affair]]'' (1967) reflected the a growing trend of shooting in real locations, rather than using backlots.

'''''Cry Freedom''''' is a 1987 British-South African epic drama film directed by [[Richard Attenborough]], set in late-1970s  [[apartheid]] era [[South Africa]]. The screenplay was written by [[John Briley]] based on a pair of books by journalist [[Donald Woods]]. The film centres on the real-life events involving black activist [[Steve Biko]] and his friend Donald Woods, who initially finds him destructive, and attempts to understand his way of life. [[Denzel Washington]] stars as Biko, while actor [[Kevin Kline]] portrays Woods. ''Cry Freedom'' delves into the ideas of discrimination, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.

The film was primarily shot on location in [[Zimbabwe]] and in [[Kenya]] due to political turmoil in South Africa at the time of production. As a film showing mostly in limited cinematic release, it was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song. It also won a number of awards including those from the Berlin International Film Festival and the British Academy Film Awards.

A joint collective effort to commit to the film's production was made by [[Universal Pictures]] and Marble Arch Productions. It was commercially distributed by Universal Pictures cinematically, and by [[MCA Home Video]] for home media. ''Cry Freedom'' premiered in cinemas nationwide in the United States on 6 November 1987 grossing $5,899,797 in domestic ticket receipts. The film was at its widest release showing in 479 cinemas nationwide. It was generally met with positive critical reviews before its initial screening in cinemas.

South African authorities unexpectedly allowed the film to be screened in cinemas without cuts or restrictions, despite the publication of Biko's writings being banned at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="nyTimesCryFreedom"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/28/world/pretoria-censors-to-let-cry-freedom-be-seen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Following a news story depicting the demolition of a slum in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[South Africa]], liberal journalist [[Donald Woods]] (Kevin Kline) seeks more information about the incident and ventures off to meet black activist [[Steve Biko]] (Denzel Washington). Biko has been officially [[banning order|''banned'']] by the [[South African government]] and is not permitted to leave his defined banning area at [[King William's Town]]. Woods is formally against Biko's banning, but remains critical of his political views. Biko invites Woods to visit a black township to see the impoverished conditions and to witness the effect of the government-imposed restrictions, which make up the apartheid system. Woods begins to agree with Biko's desire for a South Africa where blacks have the same opportunities and freedoms as those enjoyed by the white population. As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.

After speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by South African security forces. Following this, he is brought to court in order to explain his message directed toward the South African government. After he speaks eloquently in court and advocates non-violence, the security officers who interrogated him visit his church and vandalize the property. Woods assures Biko that he will meet with a government official to discuss the matter. Woods then meets with [[Jimmy Kruger]] ([[John Thaw]]), the South African Minister of Justice in his house in [[Pretoria]] in an attempt to prevent further abuse by the security force. Kruger first expresses discontent over the actions of security force, however Woods is later harassed by security forces at his home. The security men that harass Woods insinuate that their orders to visit Woods came directly from Kruger.

Later, Biko decides to travel to Cape Town to speak at a student-run meeting. En route, security forces stop his car and arrest him. He is held in harsh conditions and beaten, causing a severe brain injury. A doctor recommends consulting a nearby specialist in order to best treat his injuries, but the police refuse out of fear that he might escape. The security forces instead decide to take him to a police hospital in Pretoria, around 700 miles (1&amp;nbsp;020&amp;nbsp;km) away from Cape Town. He is thrown into the back of a prison van and driven on a bumpy road, aggravating his brain injury and resulting in his death.

Woods then works to expose the police's complicity in Biko's death. He attempts to expose photographs of Biko's body that contradict police reports that he died of a hunger strike, but he is prevented just before boarding a plane to leave and informed that he is now banned, therefore not able to leave the country. Woods and his family are targeted in a campaign of harassment by the security police. He later decides to seek asylum in England to expose the corrupt and racist nature of the South African authorities. After a long trek, Woods is eventually able to escape to the Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], disguised as a priest. His wife Wendy ([[Penelope Wilton]]) and their family later join him. With the aid of Australian journalist [[Bruce Haigh]] ([[John Hargreaves (actor)|John Hargreaves]]), the [[British High Commission]] in Maseru, and the [[Government of Lesotho]], they are flown under [[United Nations Laissez-Passer|United Nations passports]] and with one Lesotho official over South African territory, via [[Botswana]] to [[London]], where they were granted [[political asylum]].

The film's epilogue displays a graphic detailing a long list of anti-apartheid activists (including Biko), who died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned by the government.

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:South Africa racial map, 1979.gif|thumb|right|350px|Racial-demographic map of South Africa in the late 1970s.]]
The premise of ''Cry Freedom'' is based on the true story of [[Steve Biko]], the charismatic South African [[Black Consciousness Movement]] leader who attempts to bring awareness to the injustice of [[Apartheid]]; and [[Donald Woods]], the [[Liberalism in South Africa|liberal]] white editor of the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' newspaper who struggles to do the same after Biko is murdered. In 1972, Biko was one of the founders of the [[Black People's Convention]] working on social upliftment projects around Durban.&lt;ref name=aboutAfrican&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/stevebiko/a/bio-Biko.htm |title=Stephen Bantu (Steve) Biko |publisher=About.com |accessdate=2010-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BPC brought together almost 70 different black consciousness groups and associations, such as the South African Student's Movement (SASM), which played a significant role in the 1976 uprisings, and the Black Workers Project which supported black workers whose unions were not recognized under the Apartheid regime.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; Biko's political activities eventually drew the attention of the South African government which often harassed, arrested, and detained him. These situations resulted in his being banned in 1973.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt; The banning restricted Biko from talking to more than one person at a time, in an attempt to suppress the rising anti-apartheid political movement. Following a violation of his banning, Biko was arrested and later killed while in police custody. The circumstances leading to Biko's death caused worldwide anger, as he became a martyr and symbol of black resistance.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; As a result, the South African government banned a number of individuals (including Donald Woods) and organizations, especially those closely associated with Biko.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; The United Nations Security Council responded swiftly to the killing by later imposing an arms embargo against South Africa.&lt;ref name="aboutAfrican" /&gt; After a period of routine harassment against his family by the authorities, as well as fearing for his life,&lt;ref name=BBCuk /&gt; Woods fled the country after being placed under house arrest by the South African government.&lt;ref name=BBCuk&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/1/newsid_2459000/2459845.stm 1978: Newspaper editor flees South Africa]. [[BBC]]. Retrieved 20 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Woods later wrote a book in 1978 entitled: ''[[Biko (book)|Biko]]'', exposing police complicity in his death.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt; That book, along with Woods's autobiography ''Asking For Trouble'', both being published in the UK, became the basis for the film.&lt;ref name=SouthAfricanHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/people/bios/biko-s.htm |title=Stephen Bantu Biko |publisher=South African History Online |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Principal filming took place primarily in the Republic of [[Zimbabwe]] because of the tense political situation in South Africa at the time of shooting. Other filming locations included [[Kenya]], as well as film studios in [[Shepperton, England|Shepperton]] and [[Middlesex, England]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Attenborough|Attenborough, Richard]] (Director).

Indiscriminate firing by police killed and injured hundreds of African schoolchildren during a protest march.&lt;ref name="SouthAfricanHistory" /&gt;

===Music===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''Cry Freedom'' was released by [[MCA Records]] on 25 October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5E |title=Cry Freedom: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack |accessdate=2010-06-15 |publisher=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features songs composed by veteran musicians [[George Fenton]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]] and Thuli Dumakude. At Biko's funeral they sing the hymn [[Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika]]. Jonathan Bates edited the film's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800052312/cast |title=Cry Freedom |accessdate=2010-06-15 |publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A live version of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s 1980 song "[[Biko (song)|Biko]]" was released to promote the film; although the song was not on the film soundtrack, footage was used in its [[music video|video]].&lt;ref name="Bowman2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=Durrell|title=Experiencing Peter Gabriel: A Listener's Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_o8BDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=12 September 2017|date=2016-09-02|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9781442252004|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rita Kempley, writing in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', said actor Washington gave a "zealous, Oscar-caliber performance as this African messiah, who was recognized as one of South Africa's major political voices when he was only 25."&lt;ref&gt;Kempley, Rita (6 November 1987).

But on a negative front, he noted how the film "promises to be an honest account of the turmoil in South Africa but turns into a routine cliff-hanger about the editor's flight across the border. It's sort of a liberal yuppie version of that [[Night Crossing|Disney movie]] where the brave East German family builds a hot-air balloon and floats to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger (6 November 1987).

[[Janet Maslin]] writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' saw the film as "bewildering at some points and ineffectual at others" but pointed out that "it isn't dull.

Cry Freedom. ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]''. Retrieved 2010-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Rating the film with ''3 Stars'', critic [[Leonard Maltin]] wrote that the film was a "Sweeping and compassionate film". He did however note that the film "loses momentum as it spends too much time on Kline and his family's escape from South Africa". But in positive followup, he pointed out that it "cannily injects flashbacks of Biko to steer it back on course."&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard (5 August 2008). ''Leonard Maltin's 2009 Movie Guide''.

Ando was born in [[Harbin]], [[Heilongjiang]], in the Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]] (today Northeast [[China]]), to a Japanese [[industrialist]]. When the Communists took over the family fled back to Japan. After her father died in 1953, she went to work as a singer and then as a [[burlesque]] dancer.

Once Huston saw her, after auditioning 33 other actresses, he and producer [[Eugene Frenke]] were done looking, mainly because of her height over the other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Thomas, Bob |title=Try In First Hollywood Role |newspaper=[[Portsmouth Daily Times|The Portsmouth Times]] |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date=March 18, 1958 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Durgin, Cyrus |title=Asiatic Beauty Won First Role In Films With No Experience |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe|Daily Boston Globe]] |date=October 2, 1958 |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Two-people Rotation''''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:二人转|二人转]]|p=Èrrénzhuàn}}) is a genre of local folk [[dance]] and [[song]] from [[Northeast China]]. It usually involves two performers, one male and one female. They sing and dance, using folded fans or square-shaped red handkerchiefs, which are twirled along as the songs are performed, during the dancing portion. It is very popular due to its humorous dialogue and sketches, which have eclipsed the old dances and songs.

In earlier times, the Er ren zhuan has been both criticized ad loved due to its “vulgarity,” which involves profanities and sex. This also led to the reforming works of Zhao Benshan, who make the genre more appealing to the modern crowd by making it “greener." ''Er ren zhuan'' is now becoming better known in the rest of China, because many ''er ren zhuan'' performers perform on television and act in TV serials; [[Zhao Benshan]] is one of the most famous examples.

Popular routines include "Fowling", "Selling Thread", "Reward for Detective Dee's Deeds", "Ancient City", "Blue Bridge Tryst", "Romance of the West Chamber", "At Ba Bridge", "Shuangsuo Mountain", "Huarong Pass", "Palace", "Baohao", "Pandao", "Chanyu Temple" and "Spring Trip of Miss Yang the Eighth".

After the foundation of the People's Republic of China, the government cared for and supported the prosperous development of ''er ren zhuan'', organizing training courses for both old artists and new learners. It invites old artists to pass on their art to the new learners, and organizes performers of ''er ren zhuan'' to watch each other perform and learn from one another, which leads to more improvements of the art form.

"'''Eric the Half-a-Bee'''" is a song by the British comedy troupe [[Monty Python]] that was composed by [[Eric Idle]] with lyrics by [[John Cleese]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Monty Python Sings]]'' CD booklet. 1989 Virgin Records&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared as the A-side of the group's second 7" single, released in a mono mix on 17 November 1972, with a stereo mix appearing three weeks later on the group's third LP ''[[Monty Python's Previous Record]]''. On this album, the song followed the routine called "[[Fish Licence]]" in which [[Mr Praline|Mr Eric Praline]], played by Cleese, tried to obtain a pet licence for an [[halibut]] and numerous other pets all named Eric, much to the chagrin of the licence office worker ([[Michael Palin]]).  One such pet is half a [[bee]]. The song relates the tale of the half-a-bee, having been "bisected accidentally" by his owner one summer's afternoon.

The lyrics raise [[philosophical]] questions as to the existence or not of half a bee: "Half a bee, philosophically, must ''[[ipso facto]]'' half ''not'' be. But half the bee has got to be, ''vis-à-vis'' its entity – d'you see? But can a bee be said to be or not to be an entire bee when half the bee is not a bee, due to some ancient injury?"

The song ends with Cleese saying he loves his pet half-a-bee "semi-carnally", which Palin mishears as [[Cyril Connolly]], a British writer and literary critic.

It is one of Cleese's personal favourite sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=And Now For Something Completely Digital: The Complete Illustrated Guide to Monty Python CDs and DVDs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G49bRxbeH1kC&amp;pg=PA28|author=Alan Parker|author2=Mick O'Shea|date=April 2006|publisher=[[Disinfo]]|page=28|isbn=978-1-932857-31-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On more than one occasion, Cleese has expressed his regret in not having the song follow "Fish Licence" in the sketch's airing on ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' (Episode 23, "Scott of the Antarctic" 1970) as he describes himself as "most unmusical."

'''Gambling in China''' is officially illegal under [[Law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese law]].&lt;ref name="tgraph"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/6942975/Chinas-secret-gambling-problem.html|accessdate=1 May 2015|date=9 January 2010|last=Eimer|first=David|place=Shenyang|title=China's secret gambling problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, Chinese people can participate in state-run [[Lottery|lotteries]] and engage in legal [[gambling]] in the [[special administrative region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], whose legal systems resemble those of European countries which formerly administered those regions (the United Kingdom and Portugal, respectively).

==Mainland China==
The Chinese government operates two [[Lottery|lotteries]]: the China Sports Lottery and the China Welfare Lottery. The Chinese government does not legally consider the lotteries a form of gambling.&lt;ref name=Kalenyuk&gt;{{cite news |last=Kalenyuk |first=Mary |date=7 November 2013 |title=The bets are on for gambling in China |url=http://www.theworldofchinese.com/2013/11/the-bets-are-on-for-gambling-in-china/ |newspaper=[[The World of Chinese]] |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illegal gambling in China remains common, including unofficial lotteries, clandestine casinos, and betting in games such as [[mahjong]] and various [[card game]]s. In 2010, ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Daily Telegraph (UK)]]'' reported that an estimated one trillion [[Renminbi|yuan]] are wagered in illegal gambling every year in China. [[Problem gambling]] exists in the country, and may be more prevalent than in countries with legalized gambling.&lt;ref name="tgraph"/&gt; [[Online gambling]] is another outlet for illegal gambling in the country.&lt;ref name=Kalenyuk/&gt;

Various attempts have been made to establish legal casinos in mainland China, although these have been unsuccessful.

In June 2018, the Chinese Government banned all online poker application. App stores had to remove all poker related applications, and the promotion of poker in general via all social media channels in China (Wechat, Weibo) became forbidden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://somuchpoker.com/crackdown-on-online-poker-applications-in-china/|title=Crackdown on online poker applications in China - Somuchpoker|website=somuchpoker.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.This decision has been considered to be the Chinese equivalent of the [[United States v. Scheinberg|2011 American Black Friday.]]

==Hong Kong==
{{main|Gambling in Hong Kong}}

While some aspects of [[mainland Chinese]] law apply in Hong Kong, certain forms of gambling are legal and regulated in [[Hong Kong]]. The [[Law of Hong Kong]] is based on English [[common law]], Hong Kong having been a British territory [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|until 1997]]. Gambling in Hong Kong has been regulated since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deans |first=Rob |year=2001 |title=Online Gambling: Changes to Hong Kong's Gambling Legislation |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/109218801753336166 |journal=Gaming Law Review |publisher=[[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]] |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=555–560 |doi=10.1089/109218801753336166 |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hong Kong Jockey Club]] organizes much of the legal betting in the region.

==Macau==
{{main|Gambling in Macau}}

Gambling in [[Macau]] has been legal since the 1850s, when it was a [[Portuguese Macau|Portuguese colony]]. The region has a history of gambling on traditional Chinese games. Gambling in Macau now primarily takes place in Western-style [[casino]]s; in 2007, Macau overtook the [[Las Vegas Strip]] in gaming revenues. {{As of|2016}},&lt;ref&gt;2016 Wynn 10-K&lt;/ref&gt; 38 casinos operate in Macau, and the region's annual gambling revenues exceed US$27.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/abstract/macau.html |title=Macau Gaming Summary |publisher=[[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] Center for Gaming Research |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Garganta's Thrilling Science''''' was a [[comic book]] published in 2001 by [[A.C. Comics]]. The central character is [[Garganta]], also known as Dr. Carol Heisler, who can transform herself into a [[giantess]] at will. The Garganta stories, drawn by [[Stephanie Sanderson]], are supplemented by several classic comic-book adventures. Garganta is also a regular character in the [[Femforce]] comic book, where she appears in her own section ''Gargantarama''.

''Garganta's Thrilling Science'' was originally intended to be a continuing series, but only one issue (#1) has so far appeared.

Entertainment|SLG Entertainment]] and [[National Hockey League|NHL]] Enterprises, created [[hockey]]-themed superheroes called "Guardians" for each of the 30 teams in the National Hockey League. The venture includes a [[graphic novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guardianproject30.com/ |title=The Guardian Project |publisher=Guardian Media Entertainment |accessdate=January 22, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60TZcx1uY?url=http://www.guardianproject30.com/ |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Friedman |first=Wayne |url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/?fa=Articles.showArticle&amp;art_aid=152537 |title=NHL's 'Guardian Project' Strikes Marketing Deal With NBCU |work=Media Daily News |date=June 16, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/62l12sVyR?url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/152537/ |archivedate=October 27, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guardian Media reached an venture agreement with NBCUniversal in June for further media projects from movies to television series and promotion for an equity in the company.  In September, Guardian Media, SLG Entertainment, [[Anthony Chargin]], and [[J.

[[File:Henrik Ibsen Vanity Fair 1901-12-12.jpg|right|thumb|Ibsen caricatured by SNAPP for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1901]]

'''Henrik Johan Ibsen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|b|s|ən}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ibsen "Ibsen"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-no|ˈhɛnrɪk ˈɪpsn̩|lang}}; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a Norwegian playwright, theatre director, and poet. As one of the founders of [[Modernism]] in theatre, Ibsen is often referred to as "the father of [[theatrical realism|realism]]" and one of the most influential playwrights of his time.&lt;ref&gt;On Ibsen's role as "father of modern drama", see {{cite web|url=http://www.bowdoin.edu/news/events/archives/003725.shtml|title=Ibsen Celebration to Spotlight 'Father of Modern Drama'|publisher=Bowdoin College|date=23 January 2007|accessdate=27 March 2007}}; on Ibsen's relationship to modernism, see Moi (2006, 1–36)&lt;/ref&gt; His major works include ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'', ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'', ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'', ''[[A Doll's House]]'', ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'', ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'', ''[[The Wild Duck]]'', ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', ''[[Pillars of Society]]'', ''[[The Lady from the Sea]]'', ''[[Rosmersholm]]'', ''[[The Master Builder]]'', and ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]]''. He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shakespearetheatre.org/_pdf/first_folio/folio_enemy_about.pdf shakespearetheatre.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norway.lk/ARKIV/Old_web/ibsen/Ibsen_events_in_Sri_Lanka/Ibsen_launching/|title=Henrik Ibsen – book launch to commemorate the "Father of Modern Drama"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the early 20th century ''A Doll's House'' became the world's most performed play.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie G. Smith, "A Doll's House", in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History'', Vol. 2, p. 81, [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen's later work examined the realities that lay behind the façades, revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries. He had a critical eye and conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. His early poetic and cinematic play ''Peer Gynt'', however, has also strong [[surrealism|surreal]] elements.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Van Den Berg, "Peer Gynt" (review), ''Theatre Journal'' 58.4 (2006) 684–687&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibsen was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1902, 1903, and 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=4435|title=Nomination Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibsen wrote his plays in [[Danish language|Danish]] (the common written language of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] during his lifetime)&lt;ref&gt;[[Danish language]] was the written language of both Denmark and Norway at the time, although it was referred to as Norwegian in Norway and occasionally included some minor differences from the language used in Denmark. Ibsen occasionally used some Norwegianisms in his early work, but he wrote his later works in a more standardised Danish, as his plays were published by a Danish publisher and marketed to both Norwegian and Danish audiences in the original Danish. Cf. {{cite book|last=Haugen|first=Einar|authorlink=Einar Haugen|title=Ibsen's Drama: Author to Audience|year=1979|publisher=University of Minnesota|location=Minneapolis|isbn=0-8166-0896-2|page=99|chapter=The nuances of Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they were published by the Danish publisher [[Gyldendal]]. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in places reminiscent of [[Skien]], the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into [[Ibsen (family)|a merchant family]] connected to the [[Patriciate of Norway|patriciate]] of Skien, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister [[Sigurd Ibsen]]. Ibsen's dramas have a strong influence upon contemporary culture.

==Early life and family==
[[File:Altenburg2.png|thumb|A [[silhouette]] of the [[Johan Andreas Altenburg|Altenburg]]/[[Paus]] family, members of the [[Skien]] [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patriciate]], shortly after the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Ibsen was born to [[Knud Ibsen]] (1797–1877) and [[Marichen Altenburg]] (1799–1869), into a well-to-do merchant family, in the small port town of [[Skien]] in [[Telemark]] county, a city which was noted for shipping timber. As he wrote in an 1882 letter to critic and scholar [[Georg Brandes]], "my parents were members on both sides of the most respected families in Skien", explaining that he was closely related with "just about all the [[Patriciate of Norway|patrician]] families who then dominated the place and its surroundings", mentioning the families [[Paus]], [[Plesner (Norwegian family)|Plesner]], [[von der Lippe (Norwegian family)|von der Lippe]], [[Cappelen (family)|Cappelen]] and [[Blom (family from Skien)|Blom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibsen.uio.no/BREV_1880-1889ht%7cB18820921GB.xhtml|title=Henrik Ibsens skrifter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haugen (1979: 23)&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen's grandfather, ship captain Henrich Ibsen (1765–1797), had died at sea in 1797, and Knud Ibsen was raised on the estate of ship-owner [[Ole Paus (shipowner)|Ole Paus]] (1766–1855), after his mother Johanne, {{née}} Plesner (1770–1847), remarried. Knud Ibsen's half-brothers included lawyer and politician [[Christian Cornelius Paus]], banker and ship-owner [[Christopher Blom Paus]], and lawyer Henrik Johan Paus, who grew up with Ibsen's mother in the Altenburg home and after whom Henrik (Johan) Ibsen was named.

[[File:Hedvig C Paus2.jpg|thumb|left|Ibsen's grandmother Hedevig Altenburg, {{née}} [[Paus]] (cf. the character Hedvig in ''[[The Wild Duck]]'')]]
Knud Ibsen's [[Ibsen (family)|paternal ancestors]] were ship captains of Danish origin, but he decided to become a merchant, and had some initial success. His marriage to Marichen Altenburg, a daughter of ship-owner [[Johan Andreas Altenburg]] (1763–1824) and Hedevig Christine Paus (1763–1848), was a successful match.&lt;ref name="Templeton"/&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2018|reason=Ibsen uses his mother as the model of woman who suffered under his father's bullying in all his plays, so this is not accurate. Source not available online. Quote?}} Theodore Jorgenson points out that "Henrik's ancestry [thus] reached back into the important Telemark family of Paus both on the father's and on the mother's side. Hedvig Paus must have been well known to the young dramatist, for she lived until 1848."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Jorgenson (1945). ''Henrik Ibsen: life and drama''. Northfield, Minnesota: St. Olaf College Press&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents' "strange, almost incestuous marriage," and would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably his masterpiece ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

When Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, however, his father's fortunes took a significant turn for the worse, and the family was eventually forced to sell the major Altenburg building in central Skien and move permanently to their small summer house, ''Venstøp'', outside of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyers. ''Henrik Ibsen'', Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik's sister Hedvig would write about their mother: "She was a quiet, lovable woman, the soul of the house, everything to her husband and children. She sacrificed herself time and time again. There was no bitterness or reproach in her."&lt;ref name="Templeton"&gt;Michael Meyers. ''Henrick Ibsen''. Chapter one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Bernhard Jaeger, ''Henrik Ibsen, 1828–1888: et literært livsbillede'', Copenhagen, [[Gyldendal]], 1888&lt;/ref&gt; The Ibsen family eventually moved to a city house, Snipetorp, owned by Knud Ibsen's half-brother, wealthy banker and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus.&lt;ref name="Templeton"/&gt;

His father's financial ruin would have a strong influence on Ibsen's later work; the characters in his plays often mirror his parents, and his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society. Ibsen would both model and name characters in his plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his mother [[Marichen Altenburg]]; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their portrayal in dramas such as ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and ''[[Rosmersholm]]''.&lt;ref name="Templeton"/&gt;

At fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of [[Grimstad]] to become an apprentice [[pharmacist]] and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was 18, he had a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid for until the boy was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw Hans Jacob. Ibsen went to [[Oslo|Christiania]] (later renamed Kristiania and then Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His first play, the [[tragedy]] ''[[Catilina (play)|Catilina]]'' (1850), was published under the pseudonym "Brynjolf Bjarme", when he was only 22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, ''[[The Burial Mound]]'' (1850), received little attention. Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years remained unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyes. ''Henrik Ibsen''. Chapters corresponding to individual early plays.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', was apparently the Norwegian author [[Henrik Wergeland]] and the [[Norwegian folk tales]] as collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]]. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and playwright.

==Life and writings==
{{More citations needed|section|date=December 2016}}
He spent the next several years employed at [[Det norske Theater (Bergen)]], where he was involved in the production of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued writing.

Ibsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the [[Christiania Theatre]]. He married [[Suzannah Ibsen|Suzannah Thoresen]] on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child [[Sigurd Ibsen|Sigurd]] on 23 December 1859. The couple lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he left Christiania and went to [[Sorrento]] in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.

His next play, ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]'' (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial success, as did the following play, ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' (1867), to which [[Edvard Grieg]] famously composed [[incidental music]] and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] and traces of the latter's influence are evident in ''Brand'', it was not until after ''Brand'' that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously. Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read ''[[Either/Or]]'' and ''[[Fear and Trembling]]''. Ibsen's next play ''Peer Gynt'' was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Bruce. ''Divine Madness and the Absurd Paradox''. (1990) {{ISBN|978-0-313-27290-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Downs, Brian. ''Ibsen: The Intellectual Background'' (1946)&lt;/ref&gt;

With success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements into the drama, exploring what he termed the "drama of ideas". His next series of plays are often considered his Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy across Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[File:Ibsen-Dresden01.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Ibsen photographed in Dresden c. 1870]]

Ibsen moved from Italy to [[Dresden]], Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his main work, ''[[Emperor and Galilean]]'' (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]. Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to [[Munich]] in 1875 and began work on his first contemporary realist drama ''[[The Pillars of Society]]'', first published and performed in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Pillars of Society|url=http://ibsen.nb.no/index.gan?id=473|work=ibsen.nb.no|date=10 August 2001|first=Jens-Morten|last=Hanssen|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Doll's House]]'' followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which characterized Ibsen's society.

''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her to marry her fiancé despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable family was considered intolerable.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households. In ''An Enemy'', controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often "right" than the mass of people, who are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In ''An Enemy of the People'', Ibsen chastised not only the conservatism of society, but also the liberalism of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. ''An Enemy of the People'' was written as a response to the people who had rejected his previous work, ''Ghosts''. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people reacted to the plot of ''Ghosts''. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]]. He expects to be acclaimed for saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the doctor.

As audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an iconoclast, Ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political spectrum, including his own.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

''[[The Wild Duck]]'' (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals' apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the "Summons of the Ideal". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed. Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary "invention", his wife is earning the household income.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Ibsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the "ideal" is sometimes too much for the human heart to bear.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[File:Handwriting2.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Letter from Ibsen to his English reviewer and translator [[Edmund Gosse]]: "30.8.[18]99. Dear Mr. Edmund Gosse! It was to me a hearty joy to receive your letter. So I will finally personally meet you and your wife. I am at home every day in the morning until 1 o'clock. I am happy and surprised at your excellent Norwegian! Your amicably obliged Henrik Ibsen."]]

Late in his career, Ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of society's moral values and more to do with the problems of individuals. In such later plays as ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' (1890) and ''[[The Master Builder]]'' (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective consideration of interpersonal confrontation.  ''Hedda Gabler'' is probably Ibsen's most performed play,{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} with the title role regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the present day. ''Hedda Gabler'' and ''A Doll's House'' center on female protagonists whose almost demonic energy proves both attractive and destructive for those around them, and while Hedda has a few similarities with the character of Nora in ''A Doll's House'', many of today's audiences and theatre critics{{Who|date=September 2009}} feel that Hedda's intensity and drive are much more complex and much less comfortably explained than what they view as rather routine feminism on the part of Nora.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Ibsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] which was to be adopted by [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and others and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of [[William Archer (critic)|William Archer]] and [[Edmund Gosse]]. These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical novel "Stephen Hero". Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left. Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise, not only in the theatre, but across public life.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Ibsen intentionally obscured his influences. However, asked later what he had read when he wrote [[Catiline]], Ibsen replied that he had read only the Danish [[Norse saga]]-inspired [[Romantic period|Romantic]] tragedian [[Adam Oehlenschläger]] and [[Ludvig Holberg]], "the Scandinavian Molière".

==Death==
[[File:Henrik Ibsen portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Ibsen, late in his career]]
On 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo)&lt;ref&gt;since 2006 [[The Ibsen Museum (Oslo)]]&lt;/ref&gt; after a series of strokes in March 1900. When, on 22 May, his nurse assured a visitor that he was a little better, Ibsen spluttered his last words "On the contrary" ("Tvertimod!"). He died the following day at 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''Ibsen – A Biography'', Doubleday 1971, p. 807&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibsen was buried in [[Vår Frelsers gravlund]] ("The Graveyard of Our Savior") in central Oslo.

==Legacy==
[[File:Plaque to Ibsen, Oslo.jpg|thumb|Plaque to Ibsen, Oslo marking his home from 1895-1906]]
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Ibsen's death in 2006, the Norwegian government organised the [[Ibsen Year]], which included celebrations around the world. The [[NRK]] produced a miniseries on Ibsen's childhood and youth in 2006, ''[[An Immortal Man]]''. Several prizes are awarded in the name of Henrik Ibsen, among them the [[International Ibsen Award]], the [[Norwegian Ibsen Award]] and the [[Ibsen Centennial Commemoration Award]].

Every year, since 2008, the annual "Delhi Ibsen Festival", is held in Delhi, India, organized by the Dramatic Art and Design Academy (DADA) in collaboration with The Royal Norwegian Embassy in India. It features plays by Ibsen, performed by artists from various parts of the world in varied languages and styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ibsen time of the year again – Hindustan Times |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art/ibsen-time-of-the-year-again/article1-962902.aspx |date=22 November 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227063726/http://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/art/ibsen-time-of-the-year-again/article1-962902.aspx |archivedate=27 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Showcase: Reinventing Ibsen|work=The Hindu| url = http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/theatre/showcase-reinventing-ibsen/article4126276.ece |date= 24 November 2012| accessdate = 21 December 2013| location=Chennai, India| first=Swati| last=Daftuar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ibsen Society of America (ISA) was founded in 1978 at the close of the Ibsen Sesquicentennial Symposium held in New York City to mark the 150th anniversary of Henrik Ibsen's birth. Distinguished Ibsen translator and critic [[Rolf Fjelde]], Professor of Literature at [[Pratt Institute]] and the chief organizer of the Symposium, was elected Founding President. In December 1979, the ISA was certified as a non-profit corporation under the laws of the State of New York. Its purpose is to foster through lectures, readings, performances, conferences, and publications an understanding of Ibsen's works as they are interpreted as texts and produced on stage and in film and other media. An annual newsletter ''Ibsen News and Comment'' is distributed to all members.&lt;ref name="Schanke"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schanke|first1=Robert A.|title=Ibsen in America: A Century of Change|date=1988|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810820999|page=157|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eoOL_Uufu94C&amp;pg=PA157|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
[[File:Ibsen monogram.svg|thumb|[[Monogram]] of Henrik Ibsen]]

Ibsen's ancestry has been a much studied subject, due to his perceived foreignness&lt;ref&gt;Johan Kïelland Bergwitz, ''Henrik Ibsen i sin avstamning: norsk eller fremmed?'', [[Gyldendal Norsk Forlag]], 1916&lt;/ref&gt; and due to the influence of his biography and family on his plays. Ibsen often made references to his family in his plays, sometimes by name, or by modelling characters after them.

The oldest documented member of the [[Ibsen family]] was ship's captain Rasmus Ibsen (1632–1703) from [[Stege, Denmark]]. His son, ship's captain Peder Ibsen became a [[Citizen|burgher]] of [[Bergen]] in Norway in 1726.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Ibsen/norsk_slekt_som_stammer_fra_skipper_Rasmus_Ibsen|title=Ibsen – norsk slekt|author=Terje Bratberg|work=Store norske leksikon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henrik Ibsen had Danish, German, Norwegian and some distant Scottish ancestry. Most of his ancestors belonged to the merchant class of original Danish and German extraction, and many of his ancestors were ship's captains.

Ibsen's biographer [[Henrik Jæger]] famously wrote in 1888 that Ibsen did not have a drop of Norwegian blood in his veins, stating that "the ancestral Ibsen was a Dane". This, however, is not completely accurate; notably through his grandmother Hedevig Paus, Ibsen was descended from one of the very few families of the patrician class of original Norwegian extraction, known since the 15th century. Ibsen's ancestors had mostly lived in Norway for several generations, even though many had foreign ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henrik Jæger|Henrik Jaeger]], ''Henrik Ibsen. A Critical Biography'', Chicago: A.C. McClurg &amp; Co., 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergwitz, Joh. K, ''Henrik Ibsen i sin avstamning. Norsk eller fremmed?'', Nordisk forlag, Gyldendalske boghandel, Christiania and Copenhagen, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Ibsen is originally a [[patronymic]], meaning "son of Ib" (Ib is a Danish variant of [[Jacob (name)|Jacob]]). The patronymic became "frozen", i.e. it became a permanent [[family name]], in the 17th century. The phenomenon of patronymics becoming frozen started in the 17th century in bourgeois families in Denmark, and the practice was only widely adopted in Norway from around 1900.

===English translations===
The authoritative translation in the English language for Ibsen remains the 1928 ten-volume version of the ''Complete Works of Henrik Ibsen'' from Oxford University Press. Many other translations of individual plays by Ibsen have appeared since 1928 though none have purported to be a new version of the complete works of Ibsen.

'''''Horizon Group v. Bonnen''''' was a [[libel]] suit brought by Horizon Realty Group, a [[Chicago]] real estate management company, against one of its former tenants, Amanda Bonnen, in [[Circuit Court of Cook County|Cook County Circuit Court]]. This case has received extensive publicity and touches on issues such as [[consumer protection]], limits of [[libel]], [[Freedom of speech|free speech]], and [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|strategic lawsuits against public participation]]. The lawsuit was dismissed after a judge determined that the actions did not meet the definition of libel.

Horizon contended that Bonnen defamed Horizon by posting a "tweet", or [[Twitter]] message, on May 12, 2009, to her friends that said, "You should just come anyway. Who said sleeping in a moldy apartment was bad for you?  Horizon realty thinks it's ok." Horizon asked for at least $50,000 for the alleged libel&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|title=Defamation lawsuit for US tweeter|work=BBC News|date=29 July 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8173731.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterized by the plaintiff's attorney as "[[Defamation#Defamation per se|liable {{sic|nolink=y}} per se]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Horizon Group Management, LLC v Amanda Bonnen,'' Cook County No. 2009 L 8675, [http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/chicago-bar-tender/Twitter%20lawsuit.pdf Complaint], ¶ 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The story was first made public by the ''ChicagoNow'' columnist Marian Wang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will one Chicago woman's Tweet cost her $50,000? |work=ChicagoNow |date=27 July 2009 |url=http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/chicago-bar-tender/2009/07/exhibit-a-will-one-chicago-womans-tweet-cost-her-50000.html |author=Marian Wang |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730103259/http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/chicago-bar-tender/2009/07/exhibit-a-will-one-chicago-womans-tweet-cost-her-50000.html |archivedate=30 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Michael, whose family runs Horizon, said the suit was warranted and that Horizon is "a sue first, ask questions later kind of an organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tweet about apartment mold draws lawsuit |work=Chicago Sun Times |date=28 July 2009 |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/24-7/1687436,CST-NWS-twitter28web.article |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730013535/http://www.suntimes.com/news/24-7/1687436%2CCST-NWS-twitter28web.article |archivedate=30 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lawsuit prompted widespread comment from journalists, bloggers, and legal experts. Sam Bayard, assistant director of [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]]'s Citizen Media Law Project called the suit "foolhardy", adding  "They chose to file a lawsuit, instead drawing more attention to it," rather than handling the matter as a consumer complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tweet lawsuit: Chicago Landlord sues ex-tenant over tweet complaining about apartment: Internet is buzzing after ex-tenant sued for online complaint|work=Chicago Tribune|date=29 July 2009|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-twitter-suit-29-jul29,0,2500898.story|authors=Ben Meyerson and Andrew Wang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael later stated that Bonnen's Twitter post emerged from an earlier lawsuit by Bonnen that Horizon violated the Chicago Residential Landlord Tenant Ordinance, although Michael denied his suit was a [[strategic lawsuit against public participation]]. The exact cause of Bonnen's lawsuit was not discussed by Michael, but he acknowledged a leaky roof at the apartment complex caused by a contractor in March 2009.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Sue First, Ask Questions Later'?

Bonnen was represented by the Balough Law Offices, LLC, the Center for Information Technology and Privacy Law at [[John Marshall Law School (Chicago)|John Marshall Law School]] and The Law Offices of Jeffrey S. Sobek, P.C. On January 21, 2010, Horizon's suit was dismissed; the judge felt the original tweet was too vague to meet the strict definition of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freedomproject.us/post-exchange/Article-Judge_dismisses_twitter_defamation_lawsuit.aspx |title=Judge: Tweet "lacks context" for court action |publisher=McCormick Freedom Projects |date=2010-01-20 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is based on [[Hundred Regiments Offensive]], a series of engagements involving CPC's [[Eighth Route Army]] under [[Peng Dehuai]] and both [[Japanese Imperial Army|IJA]] and collaborationist Wang Jingwei forces under [[Hayao Tada]]. In [[Yan'an]], [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Zhu De]] talks about setbacks suffered by NRA in Japanese attacks. In the IJA HQ in [[Peking]], before beginning their advances against Soviet Union and Pacific Islands, the Chinese war must be finished first. Then the commanders are debriefed into Peng and Zuo's profiles then [[Yukio Kasahara]] enforce the [[Three Alls]] upon arriving on the train station. In Peng's position, Zuo told him that the Japanese are controlling the railways, building strongholds and relying on armor to ensnare them. He decided to act. The tactic was distributed to officers and Mao got the message through Zhu De.

In the [[Battle of Zaoyi]] where NRA forces was one-sidedly slaughtered by advancing IJA, Yao Shangwu was dragged away from [[Zhang Zizhong]], and the latter was killed. He was buried in full honors for his effort. He returned home, to find his village ravaged by Japanese Army's assault, massacring all except a mute villager, and his wife and baby killed. He was found by Liang Shan and her unit, when they go to the village. He joined the unit afterwards.

Meanwhile, in Wuxing Eighth Route Army HQ, Peng formulated an offensive with [[Zuo Quan]] to counter the Japanese attempts to ensnare them. He formed 22 Regiments worth, with more joining his plan, involving paralyzing 4 Japanese-controlled rail stations, bridges, mines and factories and forcing the enemies to act. He met Shangwu and Liang's unit to congratulate, revealing that Yao was graduated to [[Whampoa Academy]] and part of Zhang's army and accepts the mute guy's horse. The campaign started by derailing, assaults upon Japanese bases and outposts.

Initially, Shangwu's unit disrupt a train line and assaulted the depot in Niangziguan, suffering and inflicting casualties, but they were fooled by IJA into not touching a fake [[Red Cross]] train, the train dismounted Japanese troops and an [[armored train]] disrupts their attack, leading them to collide a train engine. The unit suffered casualties just to hold a rail switch. They are victorious in the effort. The unit was permanently honored.

In the IJA's headquarters, [[Hayao Tada]] berated Commander Okazaki for his failure and took away his medal. Meanwhile, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was listening to the broadcast in his house when [[Lin Sen]] talk to him about the history of anti-Japanese resistance of China. Mao also listens to the broadcast. Chiang later sends a commendation on the 8th Route Army.

Later, Tada commands a Collaborator to Okazaki to infiltrate the CPC's depot headed by Master Feng and returns his medal. Yao's unit was charged of defending the same depot which develops a new weapon made of chili. They also sent spies upon a Japanese armory depot in Xiyingwu, disguised as supplying Collaborrators. Peng also inspects several volunteers preparing clothes and explains to Zuo the importance of the offensive when 120th Division gives them telegrams. Yao's unit was charged of attacking the depot in Xiyingwu and the division was led by Zuo himself, but there are Japanese armor that serves as reinforcements and civilians as [[comfort women]] inside the depot. Another unit ambushed the armor convoy while Zuo's unit assaulted the depot. When the women were rescued, at the cost of Liu Zhu Zi, whose family hated him for being a 'traitor' and demoted from being a commander to an infantryman, they relentlessly killed all the Japanese soldiers they find. Mao took the telegram on its success. The mute man gave Peng shoes, but he gives it back.

Okazaki meanwhile assaulted the Huangyadong depot in Licheng with infantry and later, air support, but retreated when the news of the counterattack of the 8th was reached him. Master Feng, as well as the Collaborator died on the assault. Peng later honors the casualties and swears revenge upon Guanjianao, a major IJA stronghold and Okazaki's HQ.

Peng himself led the attack upon Panlong, Guanjianao. Casualties were rising on both sides, especially on the caves where Japanese are holed. With air support from Tada, Okazaki led the defense, Kuromon's cavalry was repulsed. The flanks were taking fire, until a squadron entered and eliminated the defenders on a side. The assault on the main peak started. Okazaki relays a message on Tada instead of Kasahara that air support must be directed to him and wears the medal he has. Liang's position was taken air strikes, but unharmed. They were charged to plant explosives under the main base. The mute man sacrificed himself while delaying the cavalry charge, Peng took the bloodied shoes. Yao was hit by airstrike, but unharmed while Liang's men are busy planting explosives. She saved Yao from an exploding bomb, knocked her unconscious. A soldier sacrificed his life while repairing the detonation cord and detonated, destroying the flanks, while Yao carries Liang to safety.

The battle ends in Peng's victory, taking the mountains. months later, Peng and Zuo debriefs his men when Yao approaches Peng and told him that if not for Liang (she died of wounds), and Peng's words, he will not be encouraged. Peng told him that it's not him, but Yao's sacrifice made him. Mao made a speech praising Hundred Regiment Offensives and commanded the listeners to use this as inspiration. Near the end of the film, both CPC and NRA are mounting offensives all over China, Zuo Quan was killed in one engagement, until Japan surrenders in 1945. At Zuo's grave, he swore that until the war is over, he will not stop fighting. He completes his map, while Hayao messed his and cried.

In 1996 in Brantford, [[New Hampshire]], teenager Alex Vreeke is given the Jumanji [[board game]] by his father, who found it on a beach. Uninterested, he sets the game aside. That night, it transforms into a [[video game]] [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] which catches Alex's attention when he is awakened by the Jumanji drum beats. When he begins playing it, he disappears into the game.

Twenty years later,&lt;!-- The film set is 2016, do not remove it. It specifically says in the movie --&gt; four students at Brantford High School are sentenced to detention: Spencer Gilpin and his former friend Anthony "Fridge" Johnson for cheating, Bethany Walker for making a phone call during an English test, and Martha Kaply for refusing to participate in gym class and insulting her teacher. In the school basement, where they are serving their detention, Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video-game system, and he and Spencer decide to play. Although it has five [[Avatar (computing)|playable characters]], they are unable to select the first one, so they choose two others, and convince the girls to play as the remaining two. When Spencer presses "Start", they are transported into the game.

They land in a jungle, in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is a tough, muscular explorer and archaeologist named Dr. Smolder Bravestone; Fridge is a diminutive zoologist named Franklin "Mouse" Finbar; Bethany is an overweight male cartographer named Professor Shelly Oberon; and Martha is a female commando and martial arts expert named Ruby Roundhouse. They each have three lives marked on their arms and Bethany immediately loses one after being eaten by a hippo. Spencer deduces that if they lose all three, they die for real.

They learn the game's story from [[Non-player character|NPC]] Nigel: corrupt archeologist Russel Van Pelt stole the Jaguar's Eye, a magic jewel, from its shrine, cursing Jumanji. Nigel escaped Van Pelt with the jewel, and the players must return it to a jaguar statue and call "Jumanji" to lift the curse. Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanji's animals. They begin tackling the game's increasingly-difficult "levels", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex, the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough. Taking shelter in a jungle house built by the game's previous player Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home. They break into a transportation shed, commandeering a [[helicopter]] to fly to the jaguar statue and return the jewel, but Fridge drops the jewel into a herd of white rhinoceros. Spencer sacrifices one of Fridge's lives, pushing him out of the helicopter as a distraction, and retrieves the jewel. Alex loses his last life when a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs CPR and transfers one of her lives to him.

At the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelt's forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha and demands the jewel, but she purposely gets a snake to bite her, allowing her to respawn and to get the jewel to Spencer. With the players on their last lives, they end the game, with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of [[rat]]s, and return to the school basement, though without Alex. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, having returned to 1996 when the game ended. Now married with children, he reveals he named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life.

Spencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany begins caring for others more than herself and plans a summer wilderness backpacking adventure, Martha and Spencer become romantically involved and the four are now friends after their experiences in the game. When they hear Jumanji's drumbeats, they bring the game behind the school and Fridge destroys it to prevent anyone from playing it again.

In March 2017, during CinemaCon, it was announced that the film's complete title was ''Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle''. Its plot involved teenagers cleaning out a school's basement who find a [[Retrogaming|vintage video-game]] version of ''Jumanji'' and are sucked into the first film's jungle setting. Although fans debated whether the film was a sequel or a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], the second trailer (released on September 20, 2017) indicated that the sequel is set 21 years after the first. Dwayne Johnson noted that the film was inspired by classic [[1990s in video gaming|video games of the 1990s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jumanji Inspired By 1990s Video Games |url=https://screenrant.com/jumanji-tone-video-games-1990s/ |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How Video Games From The 1990s Are Influencing Jumanji, According To The Rock |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1713130/how-video-games-from-the-1990s-are-influencing-jumanji-according-to-the-rock |work=Cinema Blend |date=October 12, 2017 |access-date=2018-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044825/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1713130/how-video-games-from-the-1990s-are-influencing-jumanji-according-to-the-rock |archive-date=2017-12-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site's critical consensus reads, "''Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'' uses a charming cast and a humorous twist to offer an undemanding yet solidly entertaining update on its source material."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jumanji_welcome_to_the_jungle|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|access-date=2017-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209034738/https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jumanji_welcome_to_the_jungle|archive-date=2017-12-09|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 58 out of 100 based on 44 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/movie/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle|title=Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=2018-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820020825/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle|archive-date=2018-08-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="Cinemascore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemascore.com|title=Cinemascore|work=cinemascore.com|access-date=2018-11-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102130540/https://www.cinemascore.com/|archive-date=2018-01-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dave White of ''[[TheWrap]]'' praised the cast and called the film a pleasant surprise: "''Jumanji: Welcome to The Jungle'' is the Christmas tentpole release that aims to please and succeeds, a funny family entertainment product that subverts more expectations than it was obligated to contractually".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-film-review-dwayne-johnson-kevin-hart-jack-black/|title='Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' Film Review: A Mainstream Moviegoing Miracle|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=December 19, 2017|accessdate=December 19, 2017|last=White|first=David|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220150617/https://www.thewrap.com/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-film-review-dwayne-johnson-kevin-hart-jack-black/|archive-date=2017-12-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Ehrlich of [[IndieWire]] gave the film a C grade, calling it unnecessary but mildly amusing: "''Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'' is further proof that even the stalest whiff of brand recognition has become preferable to originality. Only part of the blame for that belongs to the studios but after cannibalizing themselves for much of the last 20 years, Hollywood has clearly eaten their way down to the crumbs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Ehrlich |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-review-dwayne-johnson-jack-black-kevin-hart-karen-gillan-1201904969/ |title='Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle' Review: A Robin Williams Relic Is Reborn as a Mildly Amusing Video Game Movie |work=[[IndieWire]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media]] |date=December 8, 2017 |accessdate=December 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209072600/http://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-review-dwayne-johnson-jack-black-kevin-hart-karen-gillan-1201904969/ |archive-date=2017-12-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', [[Owen Gleiberman]] wrote: "Excitement!

'''''Lady Chatterley's Stories''''' is an [[erotic]] [[softcore pornography|softcore]] TV show that aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] where it continues running in syndication to this day.

==Premise==
The show featured [[Shauna O'Brien]] as Lady Constance Chatterley, a land [[real estate broker|broker]] by day and at night a sexual [[psychiatrist]] to her friends and exclusive clients inside her secluded mansion. Constance is known for her taste for the sexually exotic and the ability to take an unflinching look into the sex lives of her and her clients and friends. Each episode treats the viewer to a provocative and arousing story punctuated by highly charged erotic sequences.

The series featured other notable softcore stars, including [[Gabriella Hall]], [[Kim Dawson]], [[Holly Sampson]], [[Veronica Hart]], Susan Featherly, and Shannan Leigh.

The show's name appears to be derived from ''[[Lady Chatterley's Lover]]'', a controversial [[novel]] by [[D.H. Lawrence]] published in 1928.

== Production ==
The show was the result of a long line of late-night cable TV erotic series such as ''[[Erotic Confessions]]'', ''[[Women: Stories of Passion]]'', and ''[[Beverly Hills Bordello]]'' that emerged in the middle-to-late 1990s which placed an emphasis on women-centered stories where the women were in control and could be sexually independent and become actual experts in the art and science of romance and seduction. These series also served as a virtual training ground and stable, continuous employment for many a B-actress in between their movie roles.

In early 2000, Showtime joined forces with Mainline Releasing Group (more popularly known 
as MRG Entertainment) to create a 15-episode erotic series to run on late-night weekends.(MRG had produced a similar series, ''Bedtime Stories'', for rival cable channel [[Cinemax]].) Polly Quennel was brought in as executive producer and [[Rebecca Lord]] was brought in as director. In an effort to create a totally different lead character than the usual professional sex expert in other series, they decided to utilize the famous lead character from [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s classic novel, ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' but with a more modern 21st Century, independent, sexually liberated woman.

For this series, however, Lady Chatterley would become a successful [[real estate broker]] by day, and a party girl/sex expert/faux counselor by night who would create innovative ways and means to solve her friends' sexual relationship problems....all while getting her field-playing time on her own.

When it came time to cast the pivotal role of Lady Chatterley, a conflict arose between the President of Showtime Networks and the series creators who were supported by some of the lower-level executives at Showtime. Many actresses tried out for the lead role with it coming down to two:
[[Chloe (actress)|Chloe Nicholle]], a middle-level [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] adult actress better known as Chloe with limited experience and even less name recognition in the B-movie/cable TV market;
and [[Shauna O'Brien]], January 1992 [[Penthouse Pet]] and a 10-year veteran of B-movies.

The Showtime president favored O'Brien because of her impressive qualifications and experience. She also fit into his philosophy of the erotic cable series. The series brass and lower execs 
favored Nicholle because they thought that she would be more suitable for the pushing of erotic boundaries that they wanted to accomplish. The second group — in direct violation of the president's orders, and while he was away on company business — pulled off a coup-d'état by giving Nicholle the lead role and began filming, production, and promotion of the series. They were able to complete production of the first two episodes; however, this ended when the Showtime president returned from his trip and found out about their actions. Production stopped, Nicholle was fired and O'Brien hired to take over the lead role, taking over the role beginning with the third episode.

[[Israel]] has submitted films for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] since 1964.
Despite its relatively small film-making industry, ten Israeli films have been nominated for the Foreign Language Oscar, placing it in the Top Ten most nominated countries of all time. However, no Israel film has ever won the coveted award.

Since 1991, the Israeli [[Ophir Award]] winner for Best Film is automatically designated the Israeli submission for the Oscar. In 2007, ''Aviva My Love'' and ''[[Sweet Mud]]'' tied for the award, necessitating a second round of voting which resulted in the submission of ''Sweet Mud''. In 2008 ''[[The Band's Visit]]'' won the Ophir Award for Best Film but was disqualified by [[AMPAS]] for containing too much English dialogue. The runner-up ''[[Beaufort (film)|Beaufort]]'' was submitted in its place, resulting in Israel's first Oscar nomination in 23 years.

The most successful Israeli director is this category is [[Moshé Mizrahi]] who received two Oscar nominations representing Israel, and whose 1977 film ''[[Madame Rosa]]'' won the Oscar, representing [[List of French submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|France]]. [[Ephraim Kishon]] represented Israel twice, and was nominated both times. [[Joseph Cedar]] and [[Savi Gavison]] have represented Israel in the competition three times each, and Cedar was nominated twice.

==Submissions==
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has invited the film industries of various countries to submit their best film for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1956. The Foreign Language Film Award Committee oversees the process and reviews all the submitted films. Following this, they vote via [[secret ballot]] to determine the five nominees for the award.&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rule Thirteen: Special Rules for the Foreign Language Film Award |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |accessdate=2013-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822101822/http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/rules/86/rule13.html |archivedate=22 August 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a list of the films that have been submitted by Israel for review by AMPAS for the Foreign Film Oscar along with the year of the submission and the year of the respective Academy Award ceremony.

In most of the Israeli submissions, the majority of the dialogue was in [[Hebrew]]. Films which notably used another language as a primary spoken language are ''The Glass Cage'' and ''[[Moments (1979 film)|Moments]]'' ([[French language|French]]), ''[[Late Marriage]]'' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]) and ''[[Ajami (film)|Ajami]]'' (the local dialect of [[Arabic language|Arabic]]). Many others, including ''Yana's Friends'' and ''Saint Clara'', feature a heavy dose of [[Russian language|Russian]].

The missing years are those in which no film was submitted by Israel.

In [[probability theory]], the '''minimal-entropy martingale measure (MEMM)''' is the risk-neutral probability measure that minimises the [[entropy]] difference between the objective probability measure, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, and the risk-neutral measure, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. In [[incomplete market]]s, this is one way of choosing a [[risk-neutral measure]] (from the infinite number available) so as to still maintain the no-arbitrage conditions.

The MEMM has the advantage that the measure &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; will always be equivalent to the measure &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by construction. Another common choice of equivalent [[martingale measure]] is the minimal martingale measure, which minimises the variance of the equivalent [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]]. For certain situations, the resultant measure &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; will not be equivalent to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

In a finite probability model, for objective probabilities &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and risk-neutral probabilities &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; then one must minimise the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] &lt;math&gt;D_{KL}(Q\|P) = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \ln\left(\frac{q_i}{p_i}\right)&lt;/math&gt; subject to the requirement that the expected return is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the risk-free rate.

[[File:NewZealandRacingBoard.jpg|right|thumb|New Zealand Racing Board logo.]]

The '''New Zealand Racing Board''' ('''NZRB''') is a statutory [[monopoly]] for [[New Zealand]] [[sports betting]], including [[betting]] on [[horse racing]] and [[greyhound racing]]. It was established under the Racing Act 2003 to operate the [[Totalizator Agency Board|TAB]], promote the racing industry and maximise the profits of the industry. It broadcasts racing on two television channels TAB Trackside 1 and TAB Trackside 2, in addition to TAB Trackside Radio.

The Board has an obligation under the Racing Act to regulate and improve the New Zealand racing industry. It must schedule the racing calendar to maximise profit. It must promote wider ownership of racehorses and greyhounds, and best practice amongst racing clubs and racing events. It must also aim to improve the technology and efficiency of the industry, improve the atmosphere of race day events and improve the facilities of racing venues.

==TAB==
[[File:TAB Logo.jpg|thumb|TAB Logo]]
The NZ Racing Board’s income comes from [[Totalizator Agency Board|TAB]] betting revenue. The NZ Racing Board operates around 675 TAB outlets throughout New Zealand as well as On-course Tote Terminals, Internet, Phonebet and Touch Tone wagering channels. TAB Touch Tone, Phonebet and Internet wagering channels service more than 170,000 TAB account holders.

The TAB offers a wide range of [[tote board|totalisator]] and [[fixed-odds betting]] products. Just over 80 percent of the totalisator betting dollar is returned to the customer. The rest is returned to the racing and sporting codes, after tax and NZ Racing Board costs.

===TAB wagering channels===

The TAB has several different wagering channels, tailored to meet the requirements of its vastly varying customers:
* Betting at racetracks on raceday
* A national network of streetfront and social venue betting shops, one of New Zealand's largest retail networks
* A national chain of call centres. The Phonebet centres handle more operator-assisted calls than any other New Zealand call centre
* New Zealand's only betting website, www.tab.co.nz
* A Touch Tone phone betting service
* A mobile application on Android and iOS
* Other betting channels exploiting emerging new technologies are in development.

Wagering channels are constantly evolving to provide a premium standard of customer service.

===TAB wagering products===

The TAB initiated the world's first Government-run totalisator wagering service in 1951. Today a growing range of tote bet types is on offer, from win, place and each way to Poker and All Up bets, Easybets where the computer picks the runners, weighted towards the favourites, and Percentage betting to cut the cost of placing a bet.

In 1996 it added fixed-odds betting to its stable when the TAB began sports betting. Now 31 sporting codes are covered including matches and fixtures around the world, from [[rugby football]], [[Association football|soccer]] and [[cricket]] to [[sheep shearing]]. As with race betting, a proportion of every betting dollar is returned to the New Zealand sporting code on which the bet is taken. The choice of sports betting products included head to head, half / full-time double, winning team and margin, and more.

Fixed odds betting is also available on racing, through Futures books, and Final Field.

In June, 2007 [[Australia]]n racing product became available to New Zealand customers through the commingling of the Australian Super TAB and New Zealand totalisator pools. More recently the [[Tabcorp Holdings|Tabcorp]] agreement has been extended to include Australian wagering on New Zealand racing product. Commingled pools and the expansion of the New Zealand and Australian race programmes provides increased wagering opportunities for customers in both countries. The New Zealand TAB now also take betting on a selection of races from America, England, Hong Kong, Japan, France and Singapore.

===Spam Complaint===

In August 2011, the TAB was subject to a spam complaint with the department of internal affairs.[http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/complaint-over-tab-text-campaign-4352299 ]

==Responsible gambling==
The New Zealand Racing Board, under the Racing Act 2003 and associated Regulations, is required to report on programmes relating to [[problem gambling]], to provide information and advice on problem gambling and to provide problem gambling training. Since its establishment the NZ Racing Board has taken a proactive stance in meetings its responsibilities for harm prevention and minimisation. Initiatives include:
* Self exclusion programmes
* Problem gambling awareness workshops for drug addicts
* Staff intervention policies
* Tools such as maximum bet and loss limits for account holders

==Racing==
Racing is a long-established sport in New Zealand, with a tradition stretching back to colonial times. Today, the New Zealand racing industry is a major contributor to the New Zealand economy as well as local communities across New Zealand. Racing generates more than $1.4 billion in economic activity each year and creates the equivalent of 18,300 full-time jobs. More than 40,000 people derive their livelihoods from the New Zealand racing industry, not to mention accommodation, travel, fashion and entertainment providers who all benefit from the industry’s economic wellbeing. More than one million people have attended race meetings across New Zealand and spent in excess of $55 million on wagering, food, beverages, transport and accommodation in a year.

There are 69 [[thoroughbred horse race|thoroughbred]], 51 [[harness racing|harness]] and 12 [[greyhound racing|greyhound]] clubs licensed to race in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand. In the racing year from 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010, 10,106 races were held throughout New Zealand. Further to this the New Zealand Racing Board carried 35,323 overseas races on their network, for a total of 45,439 races covered for the year, an increase of approximately 27% over the previous year.

The bloodstock industry is of international importance to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses – mainly to Australia and Asia – generating more than $120 million a year. New Zealand-bred runners compete very well overseas and regularly win major races, with a particularly good record in Australian distance races.

A major source of funding for the racing industry is returns from betting on racing and sports, which is conducted by the New Zealand TAB, the retail arm of the New Zealand Racing Board.

The New Zealand Racing Board is a co-ordination point for the three racing codes. They  are operated by the three governing bodies, New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing (gallops), Harness Racing New Zealand ([[Trot (horse gait)|trotting]] and pacing) and New Zealand Greyhound Racing.

The Judicial Control Authority (JCA), established in 1996, is the legal body that administers the rules of racing and conducts inquiries into breaches of the rules, for all three racing codes. The JCA ensures that judicial and appeal proceedings in racing are heard and decided fairly, professionally, efficiently, and in a consistent and cost effective manner. The current focus of the JCA is on contributing to consumer confidence in the racing product.

==Board members==
The management of the business and affairs of the New Zealand Racing Board takes place under the direction of its governing body, the Board. The seven-member board contains a representative from each of the three codes (greyhound, thoroughbred and harness racing) as well as three independent appointed Board members and the Board Chairman. 

Current members are Glenda Hughes (Independent Chair), Rod Croon (Harness Code nominee), Greg McCarthy (Thoroughbred Code nominee), Mauro Barsi (Greyhound Code nominee), Alistair Ryan (Independent Member), Graham Cooney (Independent Member) and Barry Brown (Independent Member).

==Governance==
The Board has formally constituted three Board committees  - the Dates Committee, the Audit and Finance Committee and the Compensation and Development Committee. These committees support the Board by considering relevant issues at a suitably detailed level and reporting back to the Board.

Each committee has a written [[charter]]s setting out their roles and responsibilities, membership, functions, reporting procedures and the manner in which they are to operate. The structure and membership of each committee is reviewed annually.

===Dates Committee===
The Dates Committee is established in accordance with section 42 of the Racing Act 2003, which requires the committee to determine, following consultation with each of the recognised industry organisations, the annual racing calendar that betting will take place on.

===Audit and Finance Committee===
The Audit and Finance Committee  assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities with respect to financial reporting and the [[financial risk management]] practices of the NZRB, the work and performance of the internal audit function and the NZ Racing Board’s external auditor, Deloitte.

===Compensation and Development Committee===
The Compensation and Development Committee's purpose is to monitor issues and determine policies and practices related to the remuneration and review of the [[Chief Executive]] and the [[senior management]] team, as well as overseeing the management development and succession planning process.

===Leadership===
In late November 2014 the Board of the NZ Racing Board announced the appointment of John Allen as the organisation's new CEO.  John Allen commences his role in early March 2015.

'''''Ocean's 8''''' (stylized onscreen as '''''Ocean's Eight''''') is a 2018 American [[heist film|heist]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Gary Ross]] and written by Ross and Olivia Milch. The film is both a continuation and a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] from [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s [[Ocean's (film series)|''Ocean's'' trilogy]] and features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Mindy Kaling]], [[Sarah Paulson]], [[Rihanna]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and [[Awkwafina]]. The film follows a group of women led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual [[Met Gala]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]], United States. 

After the release of ''[[Ocean's Thirteen]]'' in 2007, Soderbergh stated he had no intentions of making a fourth film, citing his desire to have the series "go out on top". However, an all-female spin-off was announced in October 2015, with much of the cast signing on by August 2016. Filming took place from October 2016 to March 2017 around New York City.

''Ocean's 8'' premiered at [[Alice Tully Hall]] on June 5, 2018, and was released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day of the release of ''Ocean's Thirteen''. The film has grossed over $296 million worldwide and received a lukewarm critical response, with praise for the performances of the cast (particularly Bullock, Blanchett, and Hathaway), but criticism for the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/oceans-8-review-cast-release-date-uk-sandra-bullock-rihanna-cate-blanchett-a8385901.html |title=Ocean's 8: What the critics are saying about all-female reboot |first=Jacob |last=Stolworthy|work=[[The Independent]]|date=June 6, 2018|accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/oceans-8-review-round-up-anne-hathaway-is-secret-comedic-weapon-in-franchises-most-satisfying-installment-4502267.html|title=Ocean’s 8 review round-up: Anne Hathaway is 'secret comedic weapon' in franchise's 'most satisfying installment'|work=Showsha|publisher=[[Firstpost]]|author=FP Staff|date=June 8, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.in/oceans-8-review-round-producer-stephen-soderbergh-should-have-directed-movie-771164 |title=Ocean's 8 review round-up: Producer Stephen Soderbergh should have directed the movie|first=Asmita |last=Kundu|work=[[International Business Times]]|date=June 6, 2018|accessdate=June 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Following her release from prison, Debbie Ocean, younger sister of the late [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]], meets with her former partner-in-crime Lou to convince her to join a heist that she planned while serving her sentence. Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil, a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS; Amita, a jewelry maker and friend of Debbie's who is eager to move out of her mother's house and start her own life; Nine Ball, a computer [[security hacker|hacker]]; Constance, a street hustler and pickpocket; and Tammy, a profiteer and another friend of Debbie's who has been secretly selling stolen goods out of her family's suburban home.

Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million [[Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] necklace, from the [[Met Gala]] in three-and-a-half weeks, and use Met Gala co-host Daphne Kluger, a famous actress known for her long neck, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace into the gala. The team manipulates Daphne into choosing Weil as her stylist, and Weil and Amita go to Cartier to convince them to let Daphne wear the Toussaint. They also surreptitiously digitally scan the necklace in order to manufacture a [[cubic zirconia]] duplicate.

Debbie seeks out Claude Becker, an art dealer who ratted her out to the police when they were discovered for art fraud, which led to her arrest and imprisonment. Debbie manipulates Daphne to invite Becker as her date to the gala. Lou realizes that Debbie is out for revenge on Becker, but Debbie reassures her that everything will be fine.

Weil discovers a flaw in the plan: The Toussaint can only be unclasped using a special magnet carried by the bodyguards hired by Cartier. Nine Ball enlists her younger sister, Veronica, to build a similar magnet in time for the gala. As the gala begins, Daphne consumes soup that Lou spiked, causing her to vomit in the restroom, where Constance takes the necklace. When the necklace is discovered to be missing, the museum is evacuated and searched; Tammy "finds" the duplicate necklace in order to end the search before Amita, who has retrieved the real necklace and is disassembling it, is discovered in the kitchen restroom. Amita retools the Toussaint into several pieces of jewelry, and gives them to Constance to slip to the members of the team. Debbie plants one of the parts of the necklace on Becker.

Soon after the gala the necklace is returned to Cartier and identified as a fake. John Frazier, an insurance fraud investigator, arrives to investigate. Frazier, who has a history with the Ocean family, notices Debbie's presence at the gala and suspects her involvement in the heist, although he is unable to find any evidence against her. Debbie assures Frazier that she does not know where the necklace is, but she may know where part of it is. Daphne is revealed to have been in on the plan, tipped off by Weil's bad acting, and Debbie and Lou invited her in to keep her from turning them in. Daphne visits Becker for a romantic evening, and she finds the diamonds planted on him by Debbie during the gala. She sends a picture to Frazier so that he can obtain an arrest warrant, and Becker is arrested for stealing the necklace. To further frame Becker, Debbie hires actresses disguised as elderly socialites to sell pieces of the necklace and deposit the money into an account in Becker's name. 

As the eight celebrate their victory, Daphne asks Debbie and Lou how all the shares could be paid from the lesser amount made from the sale of separate parts of the necklace. Lou reveals that while the gala was being evacuated, Lou and "The Amazing" Yen were stealing some of the Royal jewels on display during the Gala, which makes their cuts higher than expected. Each member of the team goes her separate way with her money: Amita goes to Paris with a man she met on [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]]; Weil pays off her debts and opens her own store; Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a [[YouTuber]]; Tammy expands her business in selling stolen goods; Nine Ball opens a pool bar; Daphne becomes a director; Lou goes on a cross-country road trip; and Debbie returns to Danny's grave to raise a toast to him with a [[martini (cocktail)|martini]] in his honor.

''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' noted that it was tracking on-par with the 2016 all-female [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|''Ghostbusters'' reboot]] (which opened to $46 million), and had more interest from audiences than the likes of fellow female-led comedies ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'' ($39.1 million debut), ''[[Spy (2015 film)|Spy]]'' ($29.1 million) and ''[[Girls Trip]]'' ($31.2 million).&lt;ref name=preview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/05/rihanna-anne-hathaway-oceans-8-box-office-opening-projection-1202393228/|title=‘Ocean’s 8’ Looking Great On Tracking With Potential $45M Start|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Business Media|date=May 17, 2018|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film made $4 million from Thursday night previews, including $100,000 from additional early screenings Wednesday night, and $15.8 million on its first day (including previews).

==Critical reception==
According to several media outlets, ''Ocean's 8'' received a generally lukewarm response from critics.&lt;ref name="Shoard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|date=June 15, 2018|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jun/15/oceans-8-dominance-men-film-reviews|title=Ocean's 8 stars blame dominance of male critics for film's mixed reviews|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=June 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 68% based on 277 reviews, and an [[Weighted arithmetic mean|average rating]] of 6.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Ocean's 8'' isn't quite as smooth as its predecessors, but still has enough cast chemistry and flair to enjoyably lift the price of a ticket from filmgoers up for an undemanding caper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/oceans_8|title=Ocean's 8 (2018) |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/oceans-8|title=Ocean’s 8 Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[BBC News]], while critical reviews of the film were "broadly positive", "most had some reservations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 6, 2018|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-44381297|title=Is Ocean's 8 a waste of talent?|website=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by ''Ocean's Eleven'' and ''Thirteen''.&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised the cast, saying, "''Ocean's 8'' is a heist caper that looks gorgeous, keeps the twists coming and bounces along on a comic rhythm that's impossible to resist. What more do you want in summer escapism?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Travers |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Travers|date=June 6, 2018 |title='Ocean's 8' Review: Heist Franchise's Female Reboot Gives You Stars For a Steal|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/oceans-8-movie-review-sandra-bullock-cate-blanchett-w521144|work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alonso Duralde]] of ''[[TheWrap]]'' called the film "slick, charming and funny," though added it never quite kicks into high gear" and said, "Cinematographer Eigil Bryld gives the proceedings the high-gloss of a SkyMall catalog, which is appropriate for a movie about robbing a legendary Cartier necklace at fashion's most exclusive event...And between the sheen and the talented performers, ''Ocean's 8'' does eventually coast on froth and good will."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/oceans-8-film-review-sandra-bullock-cate-blanchett-rihanna/|title=‘Ocean’s 8’ Film Review: Sandra Bullock and Her Female Crew Idle Amiably in Heist Farce|first=Alonso |last=Durande |work=[[TheWrap]] |date=June 5, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'}}s [[Owen Gleiberman]] said it is "clever enough to get by" and wrote "''Ocean's 8'' is a casually winning heist movie, no more and no less, but like countless films devoted to the exploits of cool male criminals, it lingers most...as a proudly scurrilous gallery of role models."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Gleiberman, Owen |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/reviews/oceans-8-review-sandra-bullock-1202830271/|authorlink=Owen Gleiberman|title=Film Review: 'Ocean's 8' |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation|Penske Business Media]]|date=June 5, 2018 |accessdate=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said, "Some movies are more about parallel play than actual playground interaction, and despite a screenful of terrifically skillful talents, ''Ocean's 8'' never quite gets its ensemble act together. It's smooth, and far from inept. But it isn't much fun. That's all you want from a certain kind of heist picture, isn't it? Fun?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Michael |authorlink=Michael Phillips (critic) |title='Ocean's 8' review: Sandra Bullock and Rihanna lead a low-stakes reboot|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-oceans-8-rev-0605-story.html |accessdate=June 5, 2018 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from actors===
Kaling and Blanchett attributed the lukewarm reception to the dominance of male critics and a lack of diversity among mainstream film reviewers. In an interview with [[Yahoo! Movies]], Kaling cited actress [[Meryl Streep]]'s [[Meryl_Streep#Political_views|criticism of Rotten Tomatoes]] and said, "There is obviously an audience out there who want to watch things like [''Ocean's 8''], what I work on, what Sarah [Paulson] works on ... I think white men, critics would enjoy [the movie], would enjoy my work, but often I think there is a critic who will damn it in a way because they don't understand it, because they come at it at a different point of view, and they're so powerful, Rotten Tomatoes."&lt;ref name="Shoard"/&gt;

Several film journalists strongly disagreed with claims that the reception had been dictated by the gender and ethnicity of the critics. Guy Lodge, a chief film critic for ''Variety'', highlighted the fact that several female reviewers, including Emily Yoshida from ''[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Stephanie Zacharek]], concurred with the general lukewarm response.&lt;ref name="Shoard"/&gt; [[Justin Chang]], an Asian-American critic for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', argued that film criticism needed increased diversity, but "We negate the possibility of sympathetic imagination when we assume that someone’s particular affinity for a work of art will be dictated in advance by specifics of race, gender and age." He instead argued that the benefits would be a broader pool of talent and perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-film-criticism-diversity-20180620-story.html|title=We need more diversity in film criticism, but 'Who is this movie for?' is the wrong question to ask|author=Justin Chang|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Clarke from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' pointed out that film had received a "fresh" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/men-shouldn-t-review-ocean-s-8-wrong-cate-blanchett-1.3534130|title=Men shouldn't review 'Ocean's 8'?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7145">'''Oral literature''' or '''folk literature''' corresponds in the sphere of the spoken (oral) word to [[literature]] as literature operates in the domain of the [[writing|written]] word. 

==Background==

Oral literatures forms a generally more fundamental component of [[culture]], but operates in many ways as one might expect literature to do. The [[Uganda]]n scholar [[Pio Zirimu]] introduced the term '''''orature''''' in an attempt to avoid an [[oxymoron]], but ''oral literature'' remains more common both in academic and popular writing.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Auger, ''The Anthem Dictionary of Literary Terms and Theory'', Anthem Press, 2010 {{ISBN|9780857286703}}, at p. 210, and Adrian Roscoe, ''Uhuru's Fire: African Literature East to South'', CUP Archive, 1977 {{ISBN|9780521290890}} at p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The Encyclopaedia of African Literature'', edited by [[Simon Gikandi]] (Routledge, 2003), gives this definition: "Orature means something passed on through the spoken word, and because it is based on the spoken language it comes to life only in a living community. Where community life fades away, orality loses its function and dies. It needs people in a living social setting: it needs life itself."

In ''Songs and Politics in Eastern Africa'', edited by Kimani Njogu and Hervé Maupeu (2007), it is stated (page 204) that Zirimu, who coined the term, defines orature as "the use of utterance as an aesthetic means of expression" (as quoted by [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], 1988). According to the book ''Defining New Idioms and Alternative Forms of Expression'', edited by Eckhard Breitinger (Rodopi, 1996, page 78): "This means that any 'oral society' had to develop means to make the spoken word last, at least for a while. We tend to regard all the genres of orature as belonging to the homogeneous complex of folklore."

Pre-literate societies, by definition, have no written literature, but may possess rich and varied [[oral tradition]]s&amp;mdash;such as folk [[Epic poetry|epic]]s, [[folklore]], [[proverb]]s and [[folksong]]&amp;mdash;that effectively constitute an oral literature. Even when these are collected and published by scholars such as [[folklorist]]s and [[paremiography|paremiographers]], the result is still often referred to as "oral literature". The different genres of oral literature pose classification challenges to scholars because of cultural dynamism in the modern digital age. &lt;ref&gt; Kipchumba, Paul, ''Oral Literature of the Marakwet of Kenya'', Nairobi: Kipchumba Foundation, 2016. {{ISBN|1973160064}} {{ISBN|978-1973160069}}. &lt;/ref&gt;  

Literate societies may continue an oral tradition — particularly within the family (for example  [[Bedtime story|bedtime stories]]) or informal social structures. The telling of [[urban legend]]s may be considered an example of oral literature, as can [[jokes]] and also [[oral poetry]] including [[slam poetry]] which has been a televised feature on [[Russell Simmons]]' ''[[Def Poetry]]''; [[performance poetry]] is a genre of poetry that consciously shuns the written form.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Parker, [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article1725243.ece "Three-minute poetry? It’s all the rage"], ''The Times'', 16 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of oral literature==
Lore is seen in societies with vigorous oral conveyance practices to be a general term inclusive of both oral literature and any written literature, including sophisticated writings, as well, potentially, as visual and [[performance art]]s which may interact with these forms, extend their expression, or offer additional expressive media. Thus even where no phrase in local language which exactly translates "oral literature" is used, what constitutes "oral literature" as understood today is already understood to be part or all of the lore media with which a society conducts profound and common cultural affairs among its members, orally. In this sense, oral lore is an ancient practice and concept natural to the earliest storied communications and transmissions of bodies of knowledge and culture in verbal form near the dawn of language-based human societies, and 'oral literature' thus understood was putatively recognized in times prior to recordings of history in non-oral media including painting and writing.

Oral literature as a concept, after CE 19th century antecedents, was more widely circulated by [[Hector Munro Chadwick]] and [[Nora Kershaw Chadwick]] in their comparative work on the "growth of literature" (1932–40). In 1960, [[Albert B. Lord]] published ''[[The Singer of Tales]]'' (1960), which influentially examined fluidity in both ancient and later texts and "oral-formulaic" principles being used during composition-in-performance, particularly by contemporary Eastern European bards relating long traditional narratives.

From the 1970s, the term "Oral literature" appears in the work of both literary scholars and anthropologists: Finnegan (1970, 1977), Görög-Karady (1982), Bauman (1986) and in the articles of the journal ''[[Cahiers de Littérature Orale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, Alan, and Jonathan Spencer, ''Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaf culture==

Although [[Deaf culture|deaf people]] communicate manually rather than orally, their culture and traditions are considered in the same category as oral literature. Stories, jokes and poetry are passed on from person to person with no written medium.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

{{nihongo|'''''Saint Seiya Omega'''''|{{ruby-ja|聖闘士星矢|セイントセイヤ}}{{ruby-ja|Ω|オメガ}}|Seinto Seiya Omega|stylized as '''''Saint Seiya Ω'''''}} is an [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]. It is a spin-off of the ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' anime series written and illustrated by [[Masami Kurumada]], produced in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the franchise.&lt;ref name="toei"&gt;[http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/seiya/ Saint Seiya Ω new series announced by Toei Animation] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series began broadcasting in Japan on [[TV Asahi]] on April 1, 2012. It is directed by Morio Hatano (his debut as series director), with animation character designs by illustrator and animator [[Yoshihiko Umakoshi]], known for performing the same duties on ''[[Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation]]'', ''[[HeartCatch PreCure!]]'' and ''[[Casshern Sins]]''.&lt;ref name="toei"/&gt;

The series follows a young teenager known as Koga who becomes one of the 88 warriors protecting the Goddess Athena known as Saints. As the Pegasus Bronze Saint, Koga embarks on a journey to increase his power to save Athena while meeting some other Saints. For the second season, the series tells the conflict between Athena and her sister Pallas which starts a new war. The series also got a [[manga]] adaptation and a [[fighting game]].

''Omega'' was created as an alternative to the series' direct sequel ''[[Saint Seiya: Next Dimension]]'' due to lack of material to adapt. As a result, rather than refocusing on the returning cast, Toei created a new generation of Saints who would succeed the old cast. Critical reception to the series has been mixed with critics often finding it derivative from other shows from the same genre.

==Plot==
The storyline of ''Omega'' takes place 25 years after the Holy Wars of the 20th century narrated in the original manga and its anime adaptation. The goddess [[List of Saint Seiya characters|Athena]] is still on Earth after reincarnating to continue her duty of protecting peace against several antagonistic deities. Athena and a new generation of Saints prepare to face new threats that lurks in this new era, in which [[Pegasus Seiya]], the protagonist of Kurumada's manga, is revered as a Saint of legend and one of Athena's Gold Saints.

The first part of the series is the {{nihongo|"Chapter Mars"|マルス編|Marusu Hen}}, introducing the new Pegasus Saint Koga and his friends Dragon Ryuhou, Lionet Souma, Wolf Haruto, Aquila Yuna and Aria, and the beginning of their fight against the God of War Mars in his quest to capture Aria to become the new Athena. The second part is the {{nihongo|"Zodiac Temples Saga"|十二宮編|Jūnikyū Hen}}, featuring Koga and his friends who decides to fight against the many Gold Saints who have aligned themselves with Mars in their fight to save Athena before it is too late, eventually being accompanied by Orion Eden.

The second season begins the {{nihongo|"Chapter New Cloth"&lt;ref name="Blu-Ray_2-1"&gt;[http://shopping.toei-anim.co.jp/system/item/29354/ Saint Seiya Omega Chapter New Cloth Blu-ray Box{{ja icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{ruby-ja|新生聖衣|ニュークロス}}編|Nyū Kurosu Hen}}, introducing Athena's new enemy Pallas and her Pallasite warriors, a new ally in the Steel Saint Subaru, and new powers with their stronger New Cloths. The second half of season 2 comprises the {{nihongo|"Chapter Ω Awakening"&lt;ref name="Blu-Ray_2-2"&gt;[http://shopping.toei-anim.co.jp/system/item/29836/ Chapter Ω Awakening Blu-Ray Box{{ja icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;|{{ruby-ja|Ω|オメガ}}覚醒編|Omega Kakusei Hen}}, where Athena and her many Saints take their war with Pallas to her stronghold Pallasvelda, where Pallas's elite Pallasites begin to conspire against her.

===Characters===
{{see also|List of Saint Seiya Omega characters}}

As an installment separate from Kurumada's work, the series will introduce characters new to the ''Saint Seiya'' fictional universe, that will make use of elements already established within it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20120207-00000003-mantan-ent Saint Seiya Ω headlines in Yahoo Japan] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, such as the deities, exist in the original manga. Additionally, known elements from ''Saint Seiya'', such as the Cloths, the armors worn by the Saints, bear their known constellations, but are presented in ''Omega'' with a new design that differs substantially from those in the original source material, and departing from it, the Cloths emerge from jewels worn by the characters to envelop their bodies, which are known in ''Omega'' as {{nihongo|ClothStones|クロストーン|Kurosutōn}}.

The Cosmo essence, one of the basic concepts of ''Saint Seiya'', is expanded in ''Omega'' with the addition of specific elemental properties: {{nihongo|Fire|火|Hi}}, {{nihongo|Wind|風|Kaze}}, {{nihongo|Thunder|雷|Kaminari}}, {{nihongo|Earth|土|Tsuchi}}, {{nihongo|Water|水|Mizu}}, {{nihongo|Darkness|闇|Yami}} and {{nihongo|Light|光|Hikari}}.

In the second season, several Saints including the main characters have their cloths upgraded, sporting a new design much more reminiscent of Kurumada's original designs, and are stored in special boxes like in the original continuity.

==Production==
Originally, Toei planned to make an anime adaptation of the manga ''[[Saint Seiya: Next Dimension]]'' but the series' slow pace of release resulted in them trying the opposite of ''Next Dimension'': A story set several years after the events of the original manga. For this they created a new cast of main characters who would be assisted by the previous generation's Saints.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Seiya Omega Blu-ray Jacket: Interview with Go Wakabayashi&lt;/ref&gt;

The creative staff, including character designer Umakoshi and head writer Reiko Yoshida, previously worked under flagship ''Saint Seiya'' director Shigeyasu Yamauchi, either on the original ''Saint Seiya'' anime adaptation (director Morio Hatano was assistant director of its [[Saint Seiya Heaven Chapter: Overture|fifth film]]), or on his other works, such as ''[[Mushiking: King of the Beetles|Mushiking: Mori no Tami no Densetsu]]'' and ''[[Casshern Sins]]''. They referred to Yamauchi as a strong influence in interviews.&lt;ref&gt;As seen in the Saint Seiya Pia mook released in March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
{{main article|List of Saint Seiya Omega episodes}}
''Omega'' was renewed for a second season which started airing in April 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-02-23/saint-seiya-omega-to-launch-new-arc-in-april |title=Saint Seiya Omega to Launch New Arc in April - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crunchyroll]] announced on March 30, 2012 that they had acquired the rights to stream the show online with English subtitles in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, and have since continued to post new episodes online shortly after they air on TV in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-03-30/crunchyroll-to-stream-saint-seiya-omega-tv-anime | title=Crunchyroll to Stream Saint Seiya Omega TV Anime | date=2012-03-30 | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toei Animation describes it as an "original anime story", separate from the continuity of Kurumada's manga.&lt;ref name="toei" /&gt; Original ''Saint Seiya'' author Kurumada is not involved in the creative process of ''Omega'', thus he is credited as the original creator of the series' concept.&lt;ref name="asahi"&gt;[http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/seiya-koga/ Kurumada explains he trusts the Toei staff for the production of Omega.] {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception to the series has been mixed with critics often finding it derivative from other shows from the same genre. Bamboo Dong from Anime News Network said "Saint Seiya Omega is your archetypal hero tale, in which someone finds his true calling for justice, and together, he and his friends band together, embrace friendship, and vanquish evil from the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-stream/2012-05-23#sso|title=The Stream Hiiro Tale|accessdate=April 26, 2014|publisher=Anime News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fandom Post's Sean Connolly "Saint Seiya Omega is a good entry point into the franchise for those who have never tried it out." Like Dong, Connolly found the series derivatve of the genre but noted it had potential to be entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2012/04/05/saint-seiya-omega-episode-01-anime-review/|title= Saint Seiya Omega Episode #01 Anime Review |accessdate=April 26, 2014|publisher=Fandom Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandompost.com/2012/04/14/saint-seiya-omega-episode-02-anime-review/|title= Saint Seiya Omega Episode #01 Anime Review |accessdate=April 26, 2014|publisher=Fandom Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria Holden from ''[[Otaku USA]]'' listed ''Omega'' as her favorite anime from 2012 noting that despite its lighter elements, different character designs and comedic elements, she enjoys the characterization from the main cast in their growth into Saints. The updated character designs and the new elements not seen in the classic series made Holden note that ''Omega'' managed to attract a new generation of fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Otaku-USAs-Top-Anime-of-2012-4912.aspx|title=Otaku USA's Top Anime of 2012|date=January 12, 2013|accessdate=February 12, 2014|publisher=Otaku USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seiya's voice actor, [[Toru Furuya]], commented that thanks to ''Omega''{{'}}s success in Japan, several new projects related with ''Saint Seiya'' would begin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cavzodiaco.com.br/noticia/18/07/2013/imperdivel_toru_furuya_entrevistamos_o_dublador_japones_do_seiya_veja_o_que_ele_falou_sobre_possiveis_continuacoes_apos_omega_a_continuacao_do_prologo_do_ceu_sobre_ser_o_dublador_do_seiya_no_filme_em_3d_sucesso_de_omega_e_a_chave_para_a_continuacao|title=Imperdível - Toru Furuya: entrevistamos o dublador japonês do Seiya + veja o que ele falou sobre possíveis continuações após Ômega, a continuação do Prólogo do Céu, sobre ser o dublador do Seiya no filme em 3D + sucesso de Ômega é a chave para a continuação!|accessdate=April 27, 2014|publisher=Cavzodiaco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music and lyrics by [[Bono]] and [[The Edge]], and a book by [[Julie Taymor]] and [[Glen Berger]], with revisions by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]].

The musical is based on the [[Spider-Man]] comics created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], published by [[Marvel Comics]], as well as the [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|2002 film]] and the Greek myth of [[Arachne]]. It tells Spider-Man's origin story, his romance with [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] and his battles with the [[Green Goblin]]. The show includes highly technical stunts, such as aerial combat scenes and actors swinging from "webs".&lt;ref name="bla"&gt;Healy, Patrick. [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/concussion-sidelines-spider-man-actress/?hp "Concussion Sidelines ‘Spider-Man’ Actress"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. December 3, 2010. Retrieved December 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Broadway production was notorious for its many troubles. Several actors were injured performing stunts and the [[opening night]] was repeatedly pushed back to give the creative team more time to work, causing some critics to review the 'unfinished' production in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/theater/reviews/spiderman-review.html|title=Good vs. Evil, Hanging by a Thread|last=Brantley|first=Ben|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following negative reviews, ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' suspended performances for a month to retool the show. Long-time ''Spider-Man'' comics writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa was brought in to revise the story and book. Director Julie Taymor, whose vision had driven the concept of the musical, was replaced by creative [[consultant]] Philip William McKinley.

Critical reception of the opening was better than for the previews, but mixed, with praise for the visual effects but little enthusiasm for the book and score. ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'' is the most expensive Broadway production in history, and also once held the box office record for Broadway sales in one week, taking in $2.9 million over nine performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16421826 | title=Spider-Man musical makes Broadway history | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=bbc.co.uk | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production closed on January 4, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Stefanie|title='Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' to Close in January, Sources Say|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303531204579206490035959108|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115531/https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303531204579206490035959108|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=16 December 2013|date=November 19, 2013|archive-date=2014-02-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Bono and Edge in Auckland.jpg|alt=|thumb|Bono (left) and The Edge (right)]]
Although often described as a [[rock musical]], the production "treads new ground" that some commentators have asserted "have effectively distanced it from its peers—and caused some confusion when it comes time to describe the show."&lt;ref name="MTV"&gt;Marshall, Rick. [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1653191/20101129/u2.jhtml "Bono Calls 'Spider-Man' Musical 'Pop-Up, Pop-Art Opera': U2's The Edge describes Broadway's 'Turn Off the Dark' as 'something that hasn't been done before."]. [[MTV|MTV.com]]. November 30, 2010. Retrieved December 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Edge]] stated that he is unsure of what description to use for the production, because "It is elements of rock and roll, it's elements of circus, it's elements of opera, [and] of musical theater."&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt; [[Bono]], admitting that his description is a little "pretentious," has referred to it as "pop-up, pop-art opera," noting that Julie Taymor is calling it a "rock-and-roll circus drama."&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernardin, Marc.

Retrieved December 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bono has also described the production as "wrestling with the same stuff" as "[[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke]], [[William Blake|Blake]], ''[[Wings of Desire]]'', [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [and] the [[Ramones]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Wieseltier|Wieseltier, Leon]].

Retrieved January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[60 Minutes]]'' [[CBS]] special stated that it is being called a "comic book rock opera circus," although in that segment Bono noted that even using "rock" to describe the music is too narrow a description, because "We've moved out of the rock and roll idiom in places into some very new territory for us ... [including] big show tunes and dance songs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/23/60minutes/main7083076.shtml "A Peek At Spider-Man, The Musical"]. [[CBS|CBS.com]]. November 28, 2010. Retrieved December 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production was described early on as "the most technically complex show ever on Broadway, with 27 aerial sequences of characters flying" and engaging in aerial combat.&lt;ref name="bla"/&gt; The production also includes a "multitude of moving set pieces that put the audience in the middle of the action," and enough projections onto giant screens that Bono has said that it is like a three-dimensional graphic novel.&lt;ref name="MTV"/&gt;  The original story treated the origins of Spider-Man similarly to the story in the [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|2002 film]], but wove in an involved story about a villain based on the mythological [[Arachne]].  A "geek chorus" of four teenagers narrated the story.  In the rewritten version, the plot hews closer to the comic book and film and trims and transforms the role of Arachne into a "kindred spirit in Spider-Man's dreams".&lt;ref&gt;Marks, Peter.

==Synopsis==

===Version 1===
''The following is a synopsis of the show as it was performed in its preview period from November 28, 2010, to April 17, 2011. Various changes were made throughout this period, however.''

====Act I====
As the curtain rises New York City is burning ("Splash Page"). [[Mary Jane Watson]] is seen suspended from the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and [[Spider-Man]] is running to save her. He is too late, as the [[Green Goblin]] depicted as a comic book cut out, slashes the rope. As Mary Jane falls, Spider-Man makes a leap, and is tethered, frozen in a comic book panel snapshot, as citizens chant the emblem of the original version, "And the boy... falls... from... the... sky..." We are now in the present where the Geek Chorus ([[Miss Arrow]], [[Jimmy-6]], [[Professor Cobbwell|Professor Cobwell]], and [[Grim Hunter]]) enters. They are in the process of "writing" the most extreme and ultimate Spider-Man story. Miss Arrow contends that Peter Parker isn't actually the first person to become a spider. She begins to tell the story of [[Arachne]] ("Behold and Wonder"), as depicted weaving a huge tapestry on the stage with her weavers. She was an Ancient Greek weaver who challenged [[Athena]], the Goddess of Weaving, to a duel; Arachne who wove blasphemous images in her tapestry to mock the gods, won but was punished for her hubris by Athena, who destroyed her work with a crack of a lightning bolt. Arachne was so distraught, she hanged herself. Athena felt guilty, so she gave her eternal life in the form of the world's first spider, doomed to weave in the shadows forever, never more in the light.

The scene dissolves into Queens High School where Peter Parker is presenting an oral report on Arachne. His questions prompt the teacher to assign the entire class a ten-page report, which they must work on over the weekend. As revenge, his ex-best friend [[Flash Thompson]] and the other bullies at the school begin to physically and verbally abuse Peter ("Bullying by Numbers"). He walks home beaten and alone, until he runs into his next door neighbor, crush, and Flash's girlfriend, Mary Jane. They each go into their separate homes and have arguments with their guardians: Mary Jane's father tries to beat her, while Peter feels his [[Uncle Ben]] is trying to replace his dead father. Peter has been living with Uncle Ben and Aunt May ever since his parents died. Both teenagers long for escape ("No More").

The next day, the class goes on a field trip to the laboratory of Dr. [[Norman Osborn]], who is performing genetic experiments which involve splicing different gene traits from different animals together. He explains the need to speed up evolution ("D.I.Y. World") to make the world a more perfect place and shows off his prime specimen: a large female spider. Unfortunately, the spider is missing; it turns up moments later and bites Peter. The action is interrupted again by the Geek Chorus, who argue why Peter was bitten; some believe it was fate, some believe he was chosen by the spider, and some believe it was a case of him simply being in the spider's path.

Back in the story, Peter is discovering his new spider powers: climbing on the ceiling, shooting webs, and using his new found agility and strength to give a beating back to the bullies ("Bouncing Off the Walls"). Unfortunately his new powers don't impress Mary Jane, who drives off with Flash in his new car. Peter believes that if he can afford a car, he'll be able to earn MJ's love; he enters an amateur wrestling contest and defeats champion Bonesaw McGraw for the $1,000 prize. On his way home he sees Flash going into MJ's house; soon after someone steals his new car, but Peter refuses to stop him. Uncle Ben sees the thief and runs after him, only to be killed by the speeding motorist. Ashamed of his recent selfishness and powerless to save his uncle, he goes to his room to grieve; Arachne sees him and shares in his pain ("Rise Above"). She gives him a costume made with the colors she described: "For every heart that bleeds, will color your world ''red'' and the sorrow in the night, will be the ''blue'' you cannot shed." Peter copes with his uncle's death and wish to "Rise Above" by swinging through the city breaking up crimes as "Spider-Man" ("NY Debut"). Editor of the [[Daily Bugle]] [[J. Jonah Jameson]] thinks he's a menace and offers cash for whoever can manage to get pictures of him; Peter takes on the job as Spider-Man's personal photographer.

Back at the laboratory, the U.S. military tries to convince Osborn to speed up his experiments and create new genes to be spliced into people, so that they can be used as fighting machines in war times ("Pull the Trigger"). Osborn decides he will try the new experiment on himself first, with the help of his wife. Meanwhile, MJ is impressed by Peter's new status at the Daily Bugle, and the two discuss their plans after high school: MJ wants to be an actress and Peter wants to be a photographer. They flirt, while Osborn and his wife prepare the gene splicer for the new experiment ("Picture This"). The machine goes haywire and Osborn's wife is killed, while he is transformed into the Green Goblin. To avenge his wife's death, Osborn begins murdering the lab techs and takes the military men hostage; Spider-Man intervenes and saves them, but Osborn knows it is Peter; after all, it was his spider who bit him. The Green Goblin kidnaps MJ and tells Spider Man to meet him atop the [[Chrysler Building]], via a piano solo ("I'll Take Manhattan"). Spider-Man accepts, and the two have an epic battle over the audience. The Geek Chorus interrupts, wondering how they can get Spider-Man to defeat his foe; they decide that MJ has been attached to the piano and the Green Goblin pushes it over the side. He gets caught in it and falls to his death, while Spider-Man saves MJ. As he brings her down, they kiss and she asks who he is. He responds, "I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man," and swings off into the night. An image of Arachne is barely visible above them, as MJ sings "And the girl falls from the sky."

====Act II====
The Geek Chorus enters and informs the audience that Spider-Man has defeated his ultimate enemy, so their story is complete. Miss Arrow is convinced that they are not finished, because Spider-Man's real ultimate enemy should be unbeatable. So they introduce several villains which Spider-Man dispatches: [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], The [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], and Swiss Miss (whom Miss Arrow invents on the spot). Throughout this super villain parade, we also learn that Peter and MJ have formed a relationship. With all of these villains afoot, Peter is exhausted and not paying much attention to her or anyone else in his life ("Spider-Man Rising"). As Peter sleeps one night, Arachne invades his dreams. She realizes that she will no longer be alone now that there is another spider to share her darkness ("Turn Off the Dark"). She begins to weave illusions in his mind, and Peter can't tell the difference between the dream and reality when he awakes. MJ becomes completely fed up with Peter's constant lateness and disregard for her after he does not show up for her new play ("Walk Away"). That night, he decides to abandon Spider-Man forever.

The Daily Bugle finds Peter's suit thrown in the trash and runs a headline about Spider-Man disappearing. Arachne reads this and becomes enraged ("Think Again"). She devises a plan to bring Spider-Man back by having all of his former enemies descend on the city at once. The Geek Chorus interrupts, citing the fact that they are all dead. Arachne's furies then take over the script-writing and scare the Chorus away. Peter and MJ enjoy a night out dancing, now that Peter has no real commitments to Spider Man and is back in school doing well. Suddenly, the power goes out; then the walls of the club come alive with the image of the Green Goblin, apparently alive and wreaking havoc. The villains destroy the city piece by piece, yet still Spider-Man does not appear ("Sinistereo").

Arachne is upset that Spider-Man has not taken her bait, and she visits him in another dream in which the two of them get married. When that does not work, she uses a headline in the Daily Bugle about 50 stolen pairs of shoes to weasel her way into the office of J. Jonah Jameson. Her furies steal the shoes for themselves and descend upon Jameson ("Deeply Furious"). Arachne convinces him to run a headline pronouncing Spider-Man a needed hero, and he does. After enjoying the blackout and its intimacy, MJ and Peter come to a standstill: because of the dreams and the added pressure of needing Spider-Man, Peter doesn't think he can be good enough for MJ anymore. She assures him that he is all she needs in the world ("If the World Should End"). On a path of soul-searching, Peter realizes that if MJ loves him then he can go on being Spider-Man; he finds his inner hero and vanquishes the [[Sinister Six]] ("The Boy Falls From the Sky").

Arachne kidnaps Mary Jane, and the Geek Chorus appears once again. They argue about who Spider-Man's true nemesis is, the one he can never beat, with some thinking it must be MJ. But Miss Arrow assures them that it is Arachne, since she is an expert of weaving illusion. Back in the story, we see that Miss Arrow is right: Arachne has trapped Peter in her giant web. MJ is suspended in a cocoon and will die unless Peter pledges to be with Arachne, to share her darkness forever ("Love Me or Kill Me*"). They fight, and eventually Peter agrees to be with Arachne if it means saving MJ. Arachne has a sudden change of heart, realizing that there is still humanity left in the curse of the spider. She finds her own humanity and spares MJ's life. Arachne spares Peter of a life with her, as she knows he will always only love MJ and will never truly be hers; but in realizing his humanity, she has found her own and is released of her burden of darkness in the shadows. Peter watches as Arachne ascends into the heavens by the same piece of thread she used to take her life. With his suit at the Daily Bugle, MJ sees Peter and finally realizes his secret. She agrees to stand by him as sirens begin wailing and Peter swings away ("Finale").

===Version 2===
''The following is a synopsis of the show as it was performed in its official run from June 14, 2011 to January 4, 2014.''

====Act I====
At Midtown High School in [[Queens, New York]], local teenager [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] gives a book report about [[Arachne]], Goddess of the Weavers ("The Myth of Arachne"). As Peter gives his report, Arachne descends to the stage and tells the audience her story ("Behold and Wonder"). Thousands of years ago, Arachne was a skilled weaver who became conceited and boasted that she was greater than the goddess [[Athena]], who challenged Arachne to a weaving contest. During the contest, Arachne created blasphemous images of the gods. Furious, Athena destroyed Arachne's work. Devastated, Arachne hanged herself, but Athena took pity on Arachne and transformed her into the world's first spider. Now Arachne is cursed to wander the universe and weave her web for all eternity.

After class ends, Peter's ex-best friend [[Flash Thompson]] and his gang gleefully torment the straight A student ("Bullying by Numbers"). Peter has a crush on his popular next door neighbor [[Mary Jane Watson]], but they both have unhappy lives: Mary Jane has an abusive father and suffers at home while Peter suffers the torment of bullies at school ("No More"). Peter has lived with [[Uncle Ben]] and [[Aunt May]] ever since his parents [[Richard and Mary Parker]] died in a plane crash when he was a baby. A few days later, Peter and classmates go on a field trip to the genetics laboratory of scientist [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]] and his wife Emily, who explain what they hope to accomplish with their genetic research ("D.I.Y. World"). While Peter takes pictures of the lab for the school newspaper, the Osborns put the whole lab on lockdown as a dangerous genetically altered spider has escaped. While the students and scientists panic, the spider lowers itself onto Peter's shoulder and bites him ("Venom").

Peter soon becomes aware that, as a result of the spider's bite, he has spider-like powers along with a muscular physique, 20/20 vision and the ability to emit web strings from his wrists. He uses his powers at school to defeat Flash and his friends in a fistfight ("Bouncing Off the Walls"). After seeing Flash give Mary Jane a ride, Peter decides to buy a car to impress her. He enters a wrestling tournament, where he defeats champion Bonesaw McGraw for the grand prize of $1,000. Peter returns home only to learn that Uncle Ben has been shot by a carjacker. Ashamed of his recent selfishness and realizing he's powerless to save his dying uncle, Peter has an emotional encounter with Aunt May unaware that Arachne is watching over him. Arachne encourages him to use his gift to defend the innocent from evil ("Rise Above"). Peter vows to avenge Uncle Ben's death by using his powers to save the world and notes that "[[with great power comes great responsibility]]".

Peter then makes a costume with the colors that Arachne described to him (red for every heart of the innocent that bleeds, and blue for the sorrow of endangered citizens) before swinging through the city on his webs, fighting criminals and saving innocent civilians as "Spider-Man" ("NY Debut"). The ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' begins to publish articles about Spider-Man while Peter is hired by editor-in-chief [[J. Jonah Jameson]] as a [[freelancer|freelance]] [[photojournalist]]. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn begins thinking that Spider-Man stole his research as the military organization Viper Worldwide presses him to accelerate his project ("Pull the Trigger").  Norman contemplates the dilemma with Emily while Peter shares his first romantic moment with Mary Jane ("Picture This"). Norman decides to experiment on himself, causing an electrical surge that results in Emily's accidental death. Norman goes insane and mutates into the "[[Green Goblin]]".

====Act II====
The Green Goblin comes up with a plan to genetically alter other humans as he did himself ("A Freak Like Me Needs Company"). Through his experiments on his former employees, he manages to create six villains: [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Kraven the Hunter]], [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]], [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], and Swiss Miss. That night, Mary Jane tells Peter that her love for him has grown and he admits that the feeling is mutual ("If the World Should End"). The Goblin and his new alliance of criminals – calling themselves the "[[Sinister Six]]" – go on a rampage through New York ("Sinistereo"). Spider-Man quickly defeats the Sinister Six as the citizens of New York cheer him on ("Spider-Man!"), unaware that the Goblin has managed to escape. The Goblin arrives at the headquarters of the ''Daily Bugle'' and tells Jameson to print his plans of dominating the world through genetic mutation. The Goblin also tells Jameson that he gave Spider-Man life, making Jameson believe Spider-Man is in league with the Goblin and therefore giving Spider-Man an even worse image from the ''Bugle''. Later that night, Arachne comes to Peter in a vision and explains that she is his guardian along with the reminder that being a hero is his destiny and he cannot escape it ("Turn Off the Dark").

Maligned by the media and suffering financial woes, Peter wants to spend more time with Mary Jane after missing the opening night of her play and begins considering to take time off from fighting crime. Upset over Peter's constant excuses and not wanting to lose the best friend she ever had, Mary Jane suggests they take a break from their relationship ("I Just Can't Walk Away (Say It Now)"). Hurt, Peter decides not to resume his heroic acts as Spider-Man and gives his costume to J. Jonah Jameson, telling him that Spider-Man has quit. He later takes Mary Jane to a night club and impulsively proposes to her. While there, the Green Goblin intercepts the city's TV signals and sends a message to Spider-Man threatening his loved ones. Peter takes Mary Jane to his apartment and breaks off their relationship for good so that his enemies won't target her. After telling Mary Jane that he will always love her, Peter takes a walk and realizes that he needs to be a hero not only for Mary Jane but for the world ("The Boy Falls From the Sky"). Spider-Man then recovers his costume from the ''Daily Bugle'' and goes after the Green Goblin.

The Green Goblin sits at a piano at the top of the [[Chrysler Building]] and humorously boasts to the audience of his plan to destroy New York City ("I'll Take Manhattan"). Spider-Man arrives ready to fight, but is soon unmasked when the Goblin reveals he knows Spider-Man's true identity. Peter attempts to revive the good-natured Norman within the Goblin, but to no avail. Peter engages the Goblin in combat, but before he can finish him the Goblin reveals that he has Mary Jane, who now dangles from the Chrysler Building. A flying battle over the audience takes place and when it seems all hope is lost, Spider-Man webs the Green Goblin to his piano. The Green Goblin, not realizing this, thrusts the piano over the side of the Chrysler Building, taking him down to his death. After Spider-Man saves Mary Jane, she tells him not to leave and reveals that she has guessed who he is. Peter removes his mask and they embrace. The two contemplate their new life together before sirens begin wailing and Spider-Man swings away ("Finale: A New Dawn").

==History==

===Early development===
According to the ''[[New York Post]]'', Bono began composing ''Spider-Man'' after [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] joked, "I'd like to thank rock musicians for leaving me alone for 25 years&amp;nbsp;– I've had the theater all to myself"; Bono and Taymor "decided to give Andrew a little competition".&lt;ref name="Riedel" /&gt;

In August 2002, Marvel announced that [[Tony Adams (producer)|Tony Adams]] would produce a stage musical based on the Spider-Man comics.&lt;ref name="gur"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoby|first=Hermione|title=Can the Spider-Man musical turn disaster into triumph?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/06/spiderman-musical-bono-broadway-preview|accessdate=February 20, 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=February 6, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams approached Bono and The Edge to be involved with the project; in turn, they enlisted Taymor to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=David|title=Broadway's 'Spider-Man': The Full Story|url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/December-2010/Broadways-Spider-Man-The-Full-Story/|accessdate=March 10, 2011|magazine=[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]|date=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, Adams suffered a stroke while the creative team was assembled to sign contracts; he died two days later.&lt;ref name="gur" /&gt;  Patrick Healy in ''[[The New York Times]]'' described their situation:

{{quote|Others might have abandoned the project, but the ''Spider-Man'' team decided to go on, with Mr. Adams's partner, David Garfinkle, as lead producer. An able entertainment lawyer, Mr. Garfinkle had little producing experience, and he ceded artistic decisions to Ms. Taymor, a perfectionist whose aesthetic included never repeating herself. Mr. Garfinkle did not take the tack that Disney had while working with Ms. Taymor on their hit musical, ''[[The Lion King (musical)|The Lion King]]'': her genius flourishes best under supervision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/theater/spider-man-a-superlative-for-all-the-wrong-reasons.html?_r=1&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=Spider%20Man&amp;st=cse|title=A Broadway Superlative for All the Wrong Reasons|last=Healy|first=Patrick|date=March 13, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite poor reviews and bad publicity, ''Spider-Man'' was at times successful at the box office.&lt;ref name="healy20110206"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/theater/06spider.html?pagewanted=all|title='Spider-Man' Isn't Just the Talk of Broadway, It's the Punch Line|accessdate=March 23, 2011|last=Healy|first=Patrick|date=February 6, 2011|work=The New York Times|pages=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ticket sales the day after the first preview on November 28, 2010, were more than one million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Krystal.

''The New York Times''' Patrick Healy stated in February 2011 that ''Spider-Man'' had become "a national object of pop culture fascination—more so, perhaps, than any show in Broadway history" due to media coverage and late-night comedians' monologues on the musical's many delays, injuries, and creative issues. He speculated that the musical would not have staying power through repeat viewings like other hit musicals, after "tourists and parents with children" watched it for "bragging rights at dinner parties or on the playground".{{r|healy20110206}} The ''[[New York Post]]'' columnist Michael Riedel opined that month that the musical would be short-lived: "Depending on how much more money its backers are willing to lose, my hunch is that 'Spider-Man' will stagger through the spring, pick up with the tourist traffic in the summer and then collapse in the fall. It should be gone by September [2011]."&lt;ref&gt;Riedel, Michael.

''Spider-Man'' survived beyond September 2011, with ticket sales improving during the summer. About half of its audience came from beyond the [[New York metropolitan area]], including many foreign tourists. In November, its producers stated that the show earned about $100,000 to $300,000 in net income each week, which means that ''Spider-Man'' would have had to continue playing for at least five years to recoup the $75 million cost. Producers discussed adding new scenes and perhaps a new song each year to persuade fans to attend it again as "a whole new [comic book] issue".&lt;ref name="healy20111127"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/28/theater/spider-man-a-year-after-first-preview-is-on-solid-ground.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all | title=Turn on the Cash: After a Year, 'Spider-Man' Earns Its Weekly Keep | work=The New York Times | date=November 27, 2011 | accessdate=December 2, 2011 | author=Healy, Patrick | pages=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first week of January 2012, the Broadway League reported that the show had taken in $2,941,790 in ticket sales the week before, the highest single-week gross of any show in the history of Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], "Spider-Man show rakes in the dough", ''[[Japan Times]]'', January 5, 2012, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|ny20131202}} The record was previously held by ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', which took $2.2 million in a week the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-01-05/u2s-spider-man-musical-breaks-broadway-box-office-records | title=U2's Spider-Man musical breaks Broadway box office records | publisher=[[Radio Times]] | work=radiotimes.com | date=January 5, 2012 | accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales declined to $621,960, however, by the last week of September 2013.{{r|ny20131202}}

The musical has been parodied several times on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. On the December 4, 2010 episode, [[Andy Samberg]] played an understudy playing Spider-Man due to injuries, hanging upside-down from the ceiling and failing to flip over, saying, "You'll flip for it!" The February 12, 2011 episode had a commercial parody for a [[law firm]] called [[Green Goblin|Gublin and Green]] specializing in lawsuits related to ''Turn Off the Dark'', with a lawyer portrayed by [[Fred Armisen]]. While none of the plaintiffs receive cash, they do receive free tickets to a future showing of the musical. One of the testimonials in the advertisement comes from Bono, as played by [[Andy Samberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/hot-snl-parody-spider-man-turn-off-the-dark/ Hot ‘SNL’ Parody: ‘Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark’ –].

The 18th episode of the sixth season of the satirical stop-motion series ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', released February 3, 2013, features a sketch where, after the failure of ''Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark'', a second attempt is made to make a Marvel superhero musical, titled ''"[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]: Musictacular Tapstravaganza"'', featuring musical numbers sung by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Black Widow (Marvel Comics)|Black Widow]], [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]], [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], and [[Iron Man]], a dance number by [[Captain America]], and a large animatronic [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]. The musical plays out decently at best until the animatronic Hulk begins to spark and malfunction, causing an explosion that decapitates the actor playing Thor, impales the actor playing Iron Man with a pipe, and severely injures the rest of the cast. Considering the fact that the actors have no insurance, the musical's director and producer light two Molotov cocktails and toss them, burning the theatre as they make a beeline for the exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2674382/|title=Robot Fight Accident}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Broadway Bro Down]]", episode of ''[[South Park]]'', Randy Marsh discovers that men take women to see Broadway musicals because doing so arouses the women into later performing oral sex on them. When Randy later learns that a boy has taken his teenage daughter to a Broadway show, Randy sneaks into the theater in a Spider-Man costume, and swings onstage, crashing into many actors and audience members, and damaging a [[Water supply network|water main]].

The ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "I Am Spider-Man", which first aired September 23, 2012, features a Spider-Man musical, with [[Flash Thompson]] playing the web slinger.

In ''[[Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3]]'', if [[Deadpool]] is fighting Spider-Man, Deadpool says that he will "rough [Spider-Man] up like a Broadway musical!" If victorious, he tells Spider-Man that "maybe it would have helped if [he] turned off the dark!"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV2TC6usxsM Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Spider-Man/Deadpool Quotes].

''Simpsons Super Spectacular'' issue #14 features a parody musical featuring [[Bart Simpson]]'s favorite superhero Radioactive Man.  The story chronicles the many disasters that befall attempts to produce a musical featuring the hero titled ''Turn up the Silence''.

Also, at the end of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XXII]]", a hospital is filled with injured cast members.

In an episode of ''[[Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt]]'', Kimmy's friend and roommate, Titus, auditions for the role of "Spider-Man #12" in the Broadway play  ''Spider-Man 2: Too Many Spider-Men'' after a stage accident results in half the cast being injured.

In a season six episode of "[[Veep]]", Jonah Ryan agrees to help Dan Egan in return for tickets for to "a certain broadway musical whose tickets are impossible to get, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark", to which Egan informs him "that show closed years ago".

''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode Springfield Splendor, which aired October 1, 2017, uses the song NY Debut when a producer adapts Lisa and Marge's graphic novel "Sad Girl" into a theatrical show that turns disastrous — a physical bit that parodies the rash of injuries when "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" made its way to Broadway.

Jon Dolan for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the album a three stars rating out of five commenting: "Amid the all many disasters that beset the Broadway version of Spider-Man, Bono and the Edge's songs emerge pretty much unscathed by critics. Now that the show has been revised and restaged, this centerpiece anthem of struggle over adversity may become a metaphor for its slog towards redemption. "Rise Above" is a trademark soaring U2 ballad, with  the elegant grandeur cranked up to Andrew Lloyd Webber levels. But show tunes need big voices too, and, singing next to Bono on this version from the forthcoming cast recording album, leading man Reeve Carney sounds like a nervous understudy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=Rise Above 1 by Carney feat.

Erlewine summed up his review calling the songs a "murky, turgid mess, too concerned with atmosphere and narrative to reel in a listener and ironically not offering ambience or story enough to suggest that the musical would entertain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen|title=Spider-Man: Turn Off The Dark|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/spider-man-turn-off-the-dark-mw0002161756|work=Allmusic|accessdate=July 9, 2012|date=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept album features alternate orchestrations and arrangements not featured in the Broadway productions and omits a number of songs including "The Myth of Arachne," "Behold and Wonder," "Bullying By Numbers," "Venom," "Spider-Man!" "I'll Take Manhattan" and the finale "A New Dawn."

A '''spoonerism''' is an error in speech in which corresponding [[consonant]]s, [[vowel]]s, or [[morphemes]] are switched (see [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]]) between two words in a phrase.&lt;ref name="HirschKett2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eric Donald Hirsch|author2=Joseph F.

An example is saying "The Lord is a shoving leopard" instead of "[[The Lord]] is a [[The Lord is my shepherd|loving shepherd]]." While spoonerisms are commonly heard as slips of the tongue, and getting one's words in a tangle, they can also be used intentionally as a play on words.

An article in ''[[The Times]]'' from that year reports that,

In 1937, The Times quoted a detective describing a man as "a bricklabourer's layer" and used "Police Court Spoonerism" as the headline.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, 29 October 1937, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
A spoonerism is also known as a ''marrowsky,'' purportedly after a [[Polish people|Polish]] count who suffered from the same impediment.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers Dictionary 1993 {{ISBN|0-550-10255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt;Most of the quotations attributed to Spooner are [[apocryphal]]; ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'' (3rd edition, 1979) lists only one substantiated spoonerism: "The weight of rages will press hard upon the employer" (instead of "rate of wages"). Spooner himself claimed&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; that "The Kinquering Congs Their Titles Take" (in reference to a hymn)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartlett |first=John |authorlink=John Bartlett (publisher) |editor=Justin Kaplan |title= [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]  |origyear=1855 |edition=16th |year=1992 |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] |location= |isbn=0-316-08277-5 |pages=533 |editor-link= Justin Kaplan}}&lt;/ref&gt; was his sole spoonerism.

==Popular use==
In modern terms, "spoonerism" generally refers to any changing of sounds in this manner.
*On the TV series ''[[Hee Haw]]'', comedian/writer [[Archie Campbell]] was well known for using spoonerisms in his skits, most famously the "[[The Three Little Pigs|Pee Little Thrigs]]" and "[[Cinderella|Rindercella]]" skits, as well as previously doing so in his own comedy recordings well before the country/western-themed TV variety series, such as his "[[Sleeping Beauty|Beeping Sleauty]]" sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vexdVbSb4K0|title=1965 comedy: Beeping Sleauty - Archie Campbell|first=|last=MusicProf78|date=26 January 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*"Puck Flattsburgh" is a common rallying cry in the [[sports rivalry]] between [[State University of New York at Oswego|Oswego]] and [[State University of New York at Plattsburgh|Plattsburgh]] State Universities' men's ice hockey teams, especially when Oswego is victorious.

===Poetry===
[[Shel Silverstein]]'s book ''Runny Babbit'' is almost completely written in spoonerisms, from character names to anything else.

In his poem "Translation," [[Brian P. Cleary]] describes a boy named Alex who speaks in spoonerisms (like "shook a tower" instead of "took a shower"). Humorously, Cleary leaves the poem's final spoonerism up to the reader when he says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;He once proclaimed, "Hey, '''belly jeans'''"&lt;br/&gt;
When he found a stash of jelly beans.&lt;br/&gt;
But when he says he '''pepped in stew'''&lt;br/&gt;
We'll tell him he should wipe his shoe.&lt;ref&gt;Cleary, Brian P. ''Rainbow Soup: Adventures in Poetry''. Minneapolis, MN: Carolrhoda, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In [[Samuil Marshak]]'s poem ''What an Absent-Minded Guy'' (Вот какой рассеянный), the titular character uses spoonerisms at one point ("Глубокоуважаемый Вагоноуважатый! Вагоноуважаемый Глубокоуважатый!"). The character is based on the Russian scientist [[:ru:Каблуков, Иван Алексеевич|Ivan Kablukov]], who was prone to spoonerisms himself.

===Twisted tales===
Comedian [[F. Chase Taylor]] was the star of the 1930s radio program ''[[Stoopnagle and Budd]]'', in which his character, Colonel Stoopnagle, used spoonerisms. In 1945, he published a book, ''My Tale Is Twisted'', consisting of 44 "spoonerised" versions of well-known children's stories. Subtitled "Wart Pun: Aysop's Feebles" and "Tart Pooh: Tairy and Other Fales," these included such tales as "Beeping Sleauty" for "[[Sleeping Beauty]]."&lt;!--URL blacklisted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hubpages.com/hub/Spoonerism-tales |title=Spoonerisms: Tongue-tied Tales for Grown-ups |publisher=WordPlay |accessdate=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; The book was republished in 2001 by Stone and Scott Publishers as ''Stoopnagle's Tale is Twisted''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoneandscott.com/stoopnagle.asp |title=Stoopnagle's Tale is Twisted, by Ken James |accessdate=3 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006042511/http://stoneandscott.com/stoopnagle.asp |archivedate=6 October 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
*The title of the [[Van der Graaf Generator]]'s album ''[[Pawn Hearts]]'' resulted from a spoonerism by [[David Jackson (rock musician)|David Jackson]], who said one time: "I'll go down to the studio and dub on some more porn hearts", meaning to say 'horn parts'.&lt;ref&gt;Christopulos, J., and Smart, P.: ''Van der Graaf Generator – The Book'', page 128.

*The title of the [[Caravan (band)|Caravan ]] album ''[[Cunning Stunts (Caravan album)|Cunning Stunts]]'' is a thinly veiled profane spoonerism.

*The title of [[Lords of Acid]]'s 2001 album ''[[Farstucker]]'' is a thinly veiled profane spoonerism.

==Kniferisms and forkerisms==
As complements to ''spoonerism'', [[Douglas Hofstadter]] used the [[nonce words]] ''kniferism'' and ''forkerism'' to refer to changing, respectively, the vowels or the final consonants of two syllables, giving them a new meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hofstadter|first1=Douglas|title=Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Human Thought|date=1995|publisher=Basic|location=NY|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of so-called kniferisms include a British television newsreader once referring to the police at a crime scene removing a 'hypodeemic nerdle'; a television announcer once saying that "All the world was thrilled by the marriage of the Duck and Doochess of Windsor";&lt;ref name=Simonini&gt;{{cite journal |title= Phonemic and Analogic Lapses in Radio and Television Speech |journal= American Speech |volume= 31 |issue= 4 |pages= 252–263 |publisher= Duke University Press |date= December 1956 |jstor= 453412 |doi= 10.2307/453412 |last1= Simonini |first1= R.

'''''Strange as It Seems''''' appeared as a syndicated cartoon feature in 1928 and became a familiar brand to millions around the globe for its [[comic strip]]s, [[book]]s, [[radio]] shows and film shorts. Created by [[John Hix]], ''Strange as It Seems'' was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources. In Hix's words, ''Strange as It Seems'' is a library of {{cquote|the curious, in nature and humankind, set adrift on the vast sea of public opinion with the hope that it will fulfill its mission to entertain and acquaint its viewers with some of the marvels of the world in which we live.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' syndicated comic strips were printed daily in newspapers from 1928 to 1970. They were originally created by John Hix. ''Strange as It Seems'' was distinguished for its adherence to Hix's standard that every published fact be verified by a minimum of three sources.

It was syndicated domestically by [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] and internationally by [[United Press International]]. At its peak the strip was printed in 1,300 newspapers. The cartoons competed in newspapers with ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]]'' cartoons. Other similar strips at the time included Ralph Graczak's ''[[Our Own Oddities]]'' and ''[[It Happened in Canada]]'' by Gordon Johnston.

By 1953, the strip's syndication was down to 175 newspapers. The demise of multiple newspapers in cities and the changing taste of readers led to the strip ending in 1970.

The cartoon strip was written and drawn by John Hix from 1928 until his health began to deteriorate in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby began drawing the strip, although Hix continued to oversee and approve all content.

John Hix died of [[myocarditis]] on June 6, 1944 (which was also [[D-Day]]). His brother, Ernest Hix, took over producing the feature. The cartoons were drawn by Dick Kirby from 1944 to 1946, then by Doug Heyes from 1946 to 1948. After Ernest Hix's death in the crash of a private plane on September 18, 1948, in Los Angeles, the writing of the strip was taken over by his wife Elsie Huber Hix. Ms. Hix had two young children at the time, Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Dixie Ann Hix. Dick Kirby returned to draw the strip from 1948 until 1949, then George Jahns took over and continued as the feature's artist until 1970 when the strip was discontinued. Ms. Hix continued to write the stories for the comics until 1963, when she turned the work over to her son, Ernest Hix, Jr. He wrote and produced the strip with his wife Phyllis until 1970 when the feature went out of syndication.

==Radio show==
''Strange as It Seems'' was a radio program of strange and unusual tales about fantastic people and events, based on the daily syndicated newspaper cartoon panels of John Hix of the same name. ''Strange as It Seems'' began as a 15-minute radio program on March 22, 1935. It was broadcast over the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee Coast]] radio network. The schedule was 3 nights a week - Sunday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:45 PM (6:45 during summer [[daylight saving time]]). The sponsor was [[Ex‐Lax]]. In late September 1935 the show changed to two shows per week, dropping the Sunday show. In late September 1936 the schedule changed again to Tuesday and Friday nights. A 1936 booklet of the ''Strange as It Seems'' stories was sponsored by Ex-Lax and given away as a free promotion of the radio program by writing to the station. The show was hosted by [[Gayne Whitman]], produced and directed by Cyril Armbrister and the music was composed and directed by Felix Mills. Whitman had been the announcer on the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts from 1930–1934. The programs included two or three segments of dramatized events in mini plays with dramatic, fanfare music interspersed in the show between segments. After the opening line, an Ex-Lax commercial would follow. Then two or three strange stories would be presented. The show would conclude with a preview of the next show's stories, an Ex-Lax commercial, a strange fact of trivia, such as "butterflies smell with their feet" and finally a short musical ending. There were occasionally live interviews with unusual personalities, such as the World's Fastest Talker. Many of the programs were distributed on 16" [[33 RPM]] records with one 15 minute show on each side. Many sources list at least 39 of these records with a total of 78 programs recorded. This run of the shows concluded at the end of January 1937, after over 210 shows. The show began again in January 1938 as a 15-minute once a week program, airing on Sunday afternoons at 3:00 (2:00 during daylight saving time). The show ended at the end of December 1938, with 53 shows in this run.

The ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program was picked up as a 30-minute network program on the [[CBS|Columbia Broadcasting System]] from August 17, 1939 to December 26, 1940 on Thursdays at 8:30 P.M. (7:30 P.M. during the summer daylight saving time). There were 72 broadcasts of these 1⁄2 hour broadcasts. The sponsor was [[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive Shave Cream]] and the host was Alois Havrilla. Havrilla was the announcer on the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' movie shorts beginning in 1934 and continuing in that role until the shorts were ended in 1942. ''Stranger Than Fiction'' was the successor to the ''Strange as It Seems'' movie shorts that ran from 1930 until 1934.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction #2 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program had one final run in its original 15 minute format from Nov. 10, 1946 to April 13, 1947, airing at 7:30 PM on Sunday nights. There were 22 episodes aired in this run. In the newspaper story about the death of John Hix on June 6, 1944, Ernest Hix stated there were over 600 radio programs produced, indicating there were other shows than those so far identified.

===Gayne Whitman (announcer 1935–1939)===
Alfred Vosburgh was born March 19, 1890 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He first used the stage name of Alfred Whitman when he began acting in silent films in 1917. He later used the stage name [[Gayne Whitman]], beginning in 1925. He was an American radio and film actor. On radio, he played the title role in Chandu the Magician and was an announcer on other programs. He appeared in 213 films between 1904 and 1957. His wife was the former Estelle Allen. Whitman died on August 31, 1958 in Los Angeles, CA of a heart attack.

===Gordon "Felix" Mills (musical director (1935–1939)===
Gordon 'Felix' Mills was born on July 28, 1901 in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]]. He was a highly successful composer-arranger-conductor during the [[Golden Age of Radio]] in the 1930s and 1940s. He was the musical director for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air]]'', a Disney radio show of the 1930s. Mills created a "gadget band" with wild instruments for Donald Duck to direct on some episodes.

He was also the musical director for CBS Radio's ''[[Silver Theater (radio program)|Silver Theater]]'' from 1937 to 1947. Choosing to retire rather than fire a few band members during the Red Inquisition, he built a home in Morro Bay, California to pursue his favorite hobbies, sailing and slide photography. Mills died on April 5, 1987 at Morro Bay, California.

===Cyril Armbrister (producer and director 1935–1939)===
Cyril Edward Armbrister was born on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]] on August 24, 1896. His ancestors had been British loyalists during the Revolutionary War and immigrated to the Bahamas in the late 1700s. His father, William Armbrister, married for a second time at the age of 76 to Eugenie Bode and Cyril was born of this marriage. His father died when Cyril was 12 and he and his mother moved to Canada. Cyril was educated in England and was a captain in the Canadian Militia during World War I. He later moved to Hollywood and became a director. He directed ''[[Chandu the Magician (radio)|Chandu the Magician]]'', [[Terry and the Pirates (radio serial)|''Terry and the Pirates'']], and [[Land of the Lost (radio)|''Land of the Lost'']], among other radio programs. He married the actress Frances Fintel and they split their time between California and the family plantation on [[Cat Island, Bahamas]]. Cyril's son Tony developed the family plantation into the resort, Fernandez Bay. Cyril died on September 18, 1966 in Nassau, Bahamas.

===Alois Havrilla (announcer 1939‐1940)===
Alois Havrilla was born June 7, 1891 in Presov, Slovakia. He arrived in the United States as a small child, speaking no English. He worked hard to perfect his English. He began his radio career as a baritone singer. In 1921, he recorded, "Tancuj, Tancuj," a well-known Slovak folk song. He then worked as an announcer on the ''[[Colgate-Palmolive|Palmolive]] Hour'' on [[NBC]] from 1927 to 1931. He also worked as an announcer on several other radio programs, including ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in 1934–1935 and the [[Paul Whiteman]] radio program. In 1935, he received an award from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], the prestigious Medal for Good Diction and was named as the country's best radio announcer. He also worked as a narrator for [[Universal Studios|Universal]], [[Paramount Studios|Paramount]] Pictorial and Pathe Motion Picture Studios. Havrilla worked at a number of New York-area radio stations as a news commentator, announcer, narrator, and host of musical programs. He died on December 7, 1952 in Englewood, New Jersey.

==Film shorts==
[[Warner Brothers]] released a series of short films beginning in May 1930 based on Robert Ripley's ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'' cartoon series. [[Universal Studios]] responded by signing John Hix to a contract to create short films based on his cartoon strip ''Strange as It Seems''. There were 39 short subjects released between August 22, 1930 and May 5, 1934, coming out on average about once per month. The films were produced by [[Jerry Fairbanks]] &amp; Manny Nathan, scripted by John Hix and narrated by [[Gayne Whitman]].&lt;ref name="SAIS1"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0183823/ Strange as It Seems #1 (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The first 21 released in 1930 were produced in Multicolor. Beginning in September, 1932, the remaining 17 shorts were filmed in Black &amp; White. The shorts played in over 6,000 movie theaters. When Jerry Fairbanks left Universal for rival Paramount, (starting their ''[[Popular Science|Popular Science (film)]]'' films, his ''Strange as It Seems'' series was taken over by the [[Universal Studios]] newsreel staff with Thomas Mead and Joseph O'Brien in charge and renamed ''Stranger Than Fiction''. The first of these films was released on June 28, 1934 and came out about every 2 to 3 weeks. They were also filmed in black and white and were directed by Charles E. Ford and narrated by Alois Havrilla &amp; James Wallington.&lt;ref name="STF2"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0249999/ Stranger Than Fiction (1934) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning on Sept. 18, 1940, the films were directed by Henry Clay Bate and narrated by Alois Havrilla.&lt;ref name="STF70"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1556701/ Stranger Than Fiction (1940) - IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; The last of the ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films was released on August 31, 1942, for a total of 110 ''Stranger Than Fiction'' short films and a total of 149 short films, including the ''Stranger than Fiction'' series. Columbia Studios brought back the ''Strange as It Seems'' shorts in 1937. CBS bundled 8 of these shorts in a package to their television affiliates in 1949.

==Books==
The first ''Strange as It Seems'' book was published in 1931 and reprinted many of the cartoons from the three-year run of the newspaper feature. In December 1936, [[Eastern Color Printing]] published the ''John Hix Scrapbook''. In 1937, Eastern released a second volume.

There was also a hardback written by Elsie Huber Hix in 1945 and a follow-up paperback. Each sold over 500,000 copies. She published two more paperbacks, with the final one published in 1962.

==Comic books==
Comic books were a natural medium for these cartoons. The first of these comic books appeared in 1932. Promotional comic books were created for [[Ex-Lax]] (as a promotional giveaway on the radio program they sponsored) and [[United Airlines]] (as a handout for passengers to read on the flights). A series of comics began in 1939, with issues 2 – 9 being published.

==Exhibitions==
The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935. But by that fall, the promoters knew they needed to make changes. Areas like [[Gold Gulch]] (a replica of an 1849 Gold Rush town) and the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] were getting out of hand and generating bad publicity while the ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome, so the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was very popular. John Hix drew from his large collection of oddities for the Exhibition in the large building in the center of the Fun Zone. Then in 1939, the Hix brothers aced out Robert Ripley for an exhibition at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Ripley responded with his own exhibition near the Fair and named it ''Ripley's Believe It Or Not Odditorrium''. A series of the Odditoriums would eventually be created around the world. A 1938 newspaper article described the groundbreaking of the exhibit at the World's Fair "61 Year old Shovel. Auspiciously performing groundbreaking ceremonies for the John Hix "Strange as It Seems" show at the New York World's Fairground on December 30, 1938, Grover Whalen, President of the Fair, used a shovel invented 61 years before – on April 16, 1878 – by G. B. DeForest, embodying construction principles still in use. Betty Broadbent was one of the persons at the Hix's attraction. Her body was covered almost entirely with over 450 tattoos.

==Archives==
The ''Strange as It Seems'' archives are maintained by Jeff Hix, grandnephew of John Hix and the son of Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. and are currently being digitized by HistoriVision, LLC. to be made available to the public for reference as well as for use in the ''Strange as It Seems'' productions currently published on their website and [[YouTube]] channel. According to the [http://www.strangeasitseems.com ''Strange as It Seems'' website], the archives are a "40 year treasure trove of fascinating letters and photos from the world over confirming the strange and unusual stories in sports, science, popular culture, history and nature delivered daily to its faithful readership throughout the 1930's, 40's, 50's &amp; 60's."

==Ripley vs. Hix==
Robert Ripley of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]'' and John Hix of ''Strange as It Seems'' competed on many media fronts in acquiring and accumulating the most original and strange facts for their projects. There was always a friendly rivalry between Ripley and Hix in their various media offerings: 
*Robert Ripley was 16 years older than John Hix so he had a head start based on his age.
*In 1918, Robert Ripley began publishing his cartoons in newspapers. John Hix began nationally syndicating his newspaper cartoons in 1928, ten years later. 
*In April 1930, Ripley aired his first radio show; Hix started his ''Strange as It Seems'' radio program in March, 1935. 
*In May 1930, Ripley released his first movie shorts through [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]]. 3 months later in August 1930, Hix released his first film shorts through [[Universal Studios]]. 
*Ripley was selected for an exhibit at the [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in 1935. Hix replaced him with an exhibit at the show in 1936. 
*And in 1939, Hix scooped Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]]. Ripley countered by opening the first of his Ripley's Odditoriums a few blocks from the fair.

They also competed in book and comic book publishing as well.

John McCary Hix was born on June 17, 1907 in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], to John Harmon Hix and Viola Ann McCary Hix. His brother Ernest Harmon Hix was born on September 13, 1902. Before World War I, the family first located to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], then [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]]. John Harmon Hix was a traveling salesman and moved his family to [[Greenville, South Carolina]], where their third child, a daughter, Elizabeth Jane, was born in August 1918.

At an early age, John McCary Hix had a strong urge to draw. He drew unflattering caricatures of his teachers which often got him into trouble. Eventually his cartooning paid off and his drawings appeared in the ''Nautilus'', the Greenville High School newspaper. While in school, John took a job with the ''Greenville Daily News'' as a staff artist for $5 a week.
He was also a delivery boy on his bicycle, which earned him $7 a week. His dog Pal, a shaggy black and white half-[[collie]] and half-[[Water spaniel]]{{dn|date=December 2018}}, followed him everywhere on his deliveries. John trained Pal to drop papers on the doorsteps of one side of street while he delivered the other. He got up every morning at 3:00 AM and was at the newspaper office by 4:00 AM. He was also the local agent for several magazines, selling them as well. 

He studied cartooning through a correspondence course, since there were no art schools nearby. When his father died on March 5, 1926 of heart failure, John was in his senior year of school. After graduation from Greenville High School in May 1926 (he has a plaque on the Greenville High School Wall of Fame),{{cn|date=November 2018}} John decided he wanted bigger things and applied to the ''[[Washington Herald]]'' newspaper as an editorial cartoonist. He got the job and moved to Washington, D.C., where he was paid $15 a week. While in Washington D.C., he attended a few classes at the [[Corcoran College of Art and Design|Corcoran School of Art]]. 

He also started a daily one-column comic strip called ''Hicks by Hix'', featuring various wise-cracking [[Yokel|hick]] characters. It was syndicated by [[King Features Syndicate]].  The strip did very well and was syndicated to several newspapers. This success lead to a job with [[McClure Syndicate|McClure Newspapers]] in New York City. He illustrated a new strip called ''[[Frank Merriwell|Young Frank Merriwell]]'', written by [[Gilbert Patten]].&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;[http://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2006/05/frank-merriwell-bulletin.html Stripper's Guide: A Frank Merriwell Bulletin!], May 30th, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted on March 26, 1928 and ran for 6 months (the comic strip was resurrected in July 1931 as ''Frank Merriwell's Schooldays'' and ran for three years, this time illustrated by Jack Wilhelm).&lt;ref name=Frank /&gt; He also created a strip called ''[[O. Henry]]'s Short Stories''.&lt;ref name="OHenry"&gt;[https://strippersguide.blogspot.com/2018/09/obscurity-of-day-o-henrys-short-stories.html "Obscurity of the Day: O. Henry's Short Stories,"] ''Stripper's Guide'' (October 05, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he attended a few classes at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York. His dream was to attend the [[Yale School of Art]] where several of his art school classmates were attending, but there was not the money for that so most of John's art training was learned on the job.

''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]]'', drawn by Robert Ripley began syndication in 1918. It contained many fantastic claims, which were not always verified. In 1927, John conceived the idea of ''Strange as It Seems'' and in December of that year, he signed a contract with The [[McClure Newspaper Syndicate]] in New York City, making him the nation's youngest nationally syndicated artist at only 20 years old. The cartoon was announced for syndication by McClure in February 1928 and debuted on March 28, 1928 in about 50 newspapers, the same day ''Young Frank Merriwell'' debuted. The cartoon was one panel with several illustrations of strange and unusual people, places and events. The feature required much more than just drawing as countless hours of research were required for the ideas and to verify their authenticity. Hix advertised widely that all of his claims were verified by at least three sources. He even included a notation on his cartoons, "If you doubt this, write for proof to the author." In the May 20, 1929 issue of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine, it was erroneously reported that the comic had debuted the previous week. A letter to the editor three weeks later from Harold Matson, Managing Editor of the syndicate, corrected the timing of the cartoons publication dates. ''Time'' compared Hix to Ripley with this observation: "Cartoonist Hix does not seem quite so able with his pencil as Cartoonist Ripley. Astounder Ripley, after nine years, does not seem quite so astounding as fresh Astounder Hix."{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In the January 4, 1930 edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine, Hix announced that in early February 1930, ''Strange as It Seems'' would be expanded to include a full page Sunday color edition. The comic was being carried in over 80 newspapers by this time. John was now drawing a daily panel plus a Sunday color panel, a full 365 cartoons a year. As the cartoon grew in popularity and distribution spread into more papers, fans began mailing John ideas for the feature. To verify the story ideas, John would correspond with educators, scientists, civic workers and historians from around the world for photographs and documentation of authenticity. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that Hix rarely traveled for his ideas, but relied on correspondence for verification and had built a repository of 50,000–60,000 usable ideas ready to be incorporated into his cartoons. The claim that drew the most requests for proof of authenticity was that [[George Washington]] was the eighth president of the United States and that he was born on February 11, not February 22. The cartoons were often accompanied by several paragraphs of explanation in an article next to the cartoon.

John Hix continued to live in Washington D.C. and is listed in the 1930 U.S. Census as living on New Hampshire Avenue, a couple of houses down from the rest of his family.
''Strange as It Seems'' became immensely popular and there were many opportunities for expanding the feature. John's brother Ernest Hix became his business manager and together they recognized the possibilities of turning the ''Strange as It Seems'' cartoons into a multi-media empire, especially after Ripley's ''[[Believe It Or Not!]]'' cartoons were transformed into live action movie shorts for [[Paramount Studios]] beginning in May 1930. 

[[Universal Studios]] offered John Hix an opportunity to create movie shorts for their studio and the first ''Strange as It Seems'' short was released on August 22, 1930. The shorts would eventually play in over 6,000 movie theaters across the country. Like the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney brothers]] a decade before them, the Hix brothers relocated their feature to [[Hollywood, California]], in 1931. In 1931, a hardback book of the cartoon stories was released. The first of many comic books with the cartoons in them appeared in 1932. In May 1932, the cartoon was in over 150 newspapers. By November 1932, the cartoons were appearing in England, China and Japan.

In the spring of 1935, John Hix turned his cartoons into a successful 15-minute radio program on the [[CBS|Columbia – Don Lee network]]. Beginning on Sept. 13, 1936, ''The John Hix Scrapbook'' was released as half of the syndicated Sunday Color full page cartoon. In September 1939, the radio show became a 30-minute program broadcast weekly over the CBS network for 72 weeks. Over 600 radio programs were eventually created. The [[California Pacific International Exposition]] in San Diego opened in May 1935 with an exhibit of ''[[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!]]''. But by the end of that year, exhibit was deemed to be too gruesome. So the exhibitors contacted Ernest and John Hix about opening their own exhibit to replace Ripley's in the 1936 season of the fair. Their exhibit opened in February 1936 and was immensely popular. In 1939, the Hix brothers outmaneuvered Ripley for an exhibit at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]. 

In its heyday, it was reported that the ''Strange as It Seems'' comic strip was syndicated in over 1,300 newspapers. John Hix enjoyed people questioning the authenticity of his stories and continued to invite them to write for proof in each cartoon, a feature that became the centerpiece for many of his promotional newspaper articles. During World War II, John worked with the [[Office of Emergency Management]] to incorporate 70 ideas they supplied into his comics to help the war effort.

John's health began failing in the early 1940s and Dick Kirby took over the drawing of ''Strange as It Seems'', but Hix still reviewed all of the cartoons prior to publication.

On Monday evening, June 5, 1944, John Hix collapsed against a car, gashing his head in front of a hotel on Ivar Ave. He was taken to his home by his physician and died the following morning, June 6, 1944 ([[D-Day]]). The cause of death was a heart attack caused by myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle due to a viral infection). He was only 11 days shy of his 37th birthday. On June 8, 1944, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced that there would be a private service coordinated by [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks &amp; Mortuaries|Forest Lawn]] Mortuary. John was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, CA]]. His plot is in The Great Mausoleum, Memorial Terrace, Hall of Memory, Columbarium of Memory, Niche 19608. He had no wife or children.

===Ernest Hix===
Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. was born September 13, 1902 in Huntsville, Alabama. After he moved to Washington D.C. with his family in the 1920s, he met and married Elsie Huber in 1932. Ernest became the business manager of the "Strange as It Seems" business and helped to create a multi-media empire of cartoons, movies shorts, books, comics, radio programs and exhibitions. He relocated with his brother, mother, sister and wife to Los Angeles in the 1930s. In 1942, he shared an office with his brother, John, at 6362 Haywood Blvd, Los Angeles, CA and his residence was on Canyon Drive, Los Angeles, CA. Ernest took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' creative business after John Hix died suddenly in 1944. Besides continuing to write the daily syndicated cartoon, Ernest revived the radio show, as a transcribed 15 minute program in 1947. The program ran until his death on September 18, 1948 in a private plane crash, shortly after take-off from the Newhall Airport north of Los Angeles.

The plane's owner, Eugene Joseff, had been warned not to take off until a fog lifted, but he took off anyway. The plane crashed and burst into flames after circling the field. Beside Ernest Hix and Eugene Joseff, there were two other persons killed in the plane crash: John M. Lacey, the pilot and Wilmer F. Pemberton, a designer.
Joseff was the maker and supplier of about 90% of the ornate jewelry used in motion pictures at the time. After his death, Hix's wife Elsie took over the ''Strange as It Seems'' work.

===Elsie Hix===
Elsie Elizabeth Huber was born Nov. 11, 1902 in Allentown, PA.  Her parents were John and Anna Lowe Huber, both born in Germany. They immigrated separately to the United States in their twenties and were married in Pennsylvania in 1894. Elsie Huber graduated from [[Cedar Crest College]] in 1928. From 1928 to 1930, she taught secretarial courses at [[Virginia Intermont College]] in Bristol, VA. In 1930, she became the Office Business Manager of Remington Rand Co. in [[Washington, D.C.]] She held this position until her marriage in 1932 to Ernest Harmon Hix, Sr. After the family moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s, from 1939 until 1964, she was the Executive Secretary to George E. Kinsey, a Los Angeles real estate investor, philanthropist and former president of the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] Commission. After the death of her husband in 1948 in a private plane crash, she took over the work of ''Strange as It Seems''. She was the writer of the comic strip for 15 years until 1963, when she turned it over to her son, Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. In 1964, she married Donald Lee Chamberlin. They were married until his death in 1976. From 1985 she lived in Glendora, CA. She died on December 9, 1995 in Glendale, CA and is buried in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park cemetery in Glendale.

===Phyllis and Ernest Hix, Jr.===
Ernest Harmon Hix, Jr. is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Sr. and Elsie Elizabeth Huber Hix. He wrote and produced the ''Strange as It Seems'' comic strip with his wife Phyllis from 1963 until the feature ceased production in 1970.

===Jeff Hix===
Jeffrey David Hix is the son of Ernest Harmon Hix Jr. and Phyllis Hix and is curator of the ''Strange as It Seems'' archives. Hix is reviving the ''Strange as It Seems'' brand for the digital age.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historivision.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syndication exclusivity''' (also known as '''syndex''') is a [[federal law]] implemented by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) in the United States that is designed to protect a local [[television station]]'s rights to [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television programs by granting exclusive broadcast rights to the station for that program in their [[media market|local market]], usually defined by a station's [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] Designated Market Area.

As a result, any airings of the same program on [[cable network]]s and, more commonly, [[superstation]]s must be blocked by the local [[cable television|cable]] provider upon request from the local station. Broadcast television stations have the option of signing programming deals with or without syndex protection, but they stand to have audiences significantly diluted in markets without protection. Syndex protection is rarely enforced in regards to conventional cable networks, which (particularly since the late 1990s) often concurrently maintain rights to a particular program during the period of a broadcast syndication deal.

==History==
The first syndex rule to be passed by the Federal Communications Commission went into effect on March 31, 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC adopts compromise plan on big city cable television|newspaper=[[Daily Independent Journal]]|location=San Rafael, California|date=February 3, 1972|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC adopts rulings on cable TV|newspaper=[[El Paso Herald-Post]]|date=February 3, 1972|page=A6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations at the time were similar to those in the present-day law, except for the fact that they applied to almost all programming, including shows such as the [[MDA Show of Strength|Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpjohnson1.tripod.com/page2.html dpjohnson1]&lt;/ref&gt; [[TBS (TV network)|WTCG]] in [[Atlanta]], the original "superstation" (which at the time was distributed only in the Southeastern United States, five years before it became available nationally via [[communications satellite|satellite]] transmission), had programming blacked out in some areas where duplication existed.

In November 1976, the FCC began to consider making alterations to the syndex rulings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC mulls new rules on cable television|newspaper=[[Des Moines Register]]|date=November 6, 1976|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1979, the FCC made a proposal to remove some of the rules. Further debate led the Cable Television Bureau of the FCC to recommend doing away with the rules entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spread of cable TV concerns operators|newspaper=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|date=June 26, 1979|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Proposed cable TV access rules generate lively debate|newspaper=[[Kokomo Tribune]]|date=February 22, 1980|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 1980, the Commission revoked the syndex rulings in a 4–3 vote, on the basis that "local stations are not adversely affected when a cable system offers subscribers signals from television stations in other cities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC substantially deregulates cable television industry|newspaper=[[San Bernardino County Sun]]|date=July 23, 1980|page=A-8|quote=A Federal agency Tuesday substantially deregulated the cable television industry, by ruling local stations are not adversely affected when a cable system offers subscribers signals from television stations in other cities.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the FCC lifted the old syndex law, as a way to bolster the growing cable television industry. This led cable systems to begin carrying other superstations and more regional out-of-market [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]], at a time when the popularity of both was growing.

The current syndex law was tied in part to the [[Satellite Home Viewer Act]] of 1988. In the run-up to that legislation's passage on May 18, 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC Reimposes Rule On TV Exclusivity|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-05-19/business/8803180484_1_fcc-chairman-dennis-patrick-exclusivity-rules-superstations|author=Charles Storch|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=May 19, 1988|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC Reinstates Exclusive Rights|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-05-18/news/mn-2996_1_exclusive-rights|agency=[[Reuters]]|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 18, 1988|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Same reruns on too many channels? FCC says no more. Panel's ruling considered defeat for cable operators|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1988/0526/lfcc.html|author=Louise Sweeney|periodical=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=May 26, 1988|accessdate=September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Meek]] (general manager of [[WOFL]] in [[Orlando, Florida]]), with the assistance of [[Preston Padden]] of the [[Association of Independent Television Stations]] (INTV), presented a study utilizing custom [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] audience data showing significant ratings dilution in the 7:00–8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. period that was directly attributable to the carriage of identical programming via Chicago superstation [[WGN-TV]] on numerous local cable providers, resulting in an estimated loss in advertising revenue of several hundred thousand dollars. The legislation, [[House Resolution|H.R.]] 2848, had been blocked by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] representative [[Mike Synar]], whose district included [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], where WGN's satellite carrier [[Gemstar-TV Guide International|United Video Satellite Group]] was headquartered. After the study was presented to and subsequently validated by Synar's staff, Synar dropped his opposition under pressure from committee chairman [[Washington (state)|Washington]] Democratic Rep. [[Al Swift]]. H.R. 2848, sponsored by [[Texas]] Democratic Rep. [[John Wiley Bryant|John Bryant]], then passed.

The syndex rules went back into effect on January 1, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCC ruling may cause TV scheduling problems|newspaper=[[The Galveston Daily News]]|date=December 27, 1989|page=15|quote=A Federal Communications Commission ruling that will go into effect Jan. 1 may for a time affect the accuracy of television listings, according to an industry spokesman.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the reimposition of the syndex rules, stations like WGN and WTBS were paying local single market rates for programming acquisitions, even as they were gaining national coverage, and were selling that extended coverage to advertisers. After the syndex law was implemented, in at least some cases, the prices that superstations paid for program content had better{{According to whom|date=November 2015}} reflected their actual national distribution, depending on arrangements with any given syndicator.

Syndex is currently{{When|date=November 2015}} being used to block superstations offered through a programming tier provided by satellite provider [[Dish Network]] from being picked up in certain markets. In this case, the [[The CW|CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliates in given markets can invoke the syndex law to keep the superstations that have the same network affiliations as the local station from coming into the market in any form. CW stations are using the law in order to block [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles, [[WPIX]]/New York City and [[KWGN-TV]]/[[Denver]], while [[WWOR-TV]] in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] and [[WSBK-TV]]/[[Boston]] are presently{{When|date=November 2015}} blocked in markets where MyNetworkTV affiliates are invoking the law.

There have been a number of legal cases, most notably in [[Miami]], and efforts in Washington, D.C. by terrestrial broadcasters to keep satellite providers from exploiting a provision in the law whereby satellite providers can offer programming where a broadcast station's signal is not available. In the Miami case, satellite providers were found to have allowed carriage of outside stations in households within a few miles of broadcast transmitters in violation of the law. Syndex is often unpopular{{According to whom|date=November 2015}} with satellite subscribers and companies who would rather not afford local broadcast stations program rights protection.

==Notable examples==
* Syndex also applies to programs seen on stations in Canada and Mexico – in the [[Buffalo, New York]] television market, when [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[CFTO-DT]] or [[Global Television Network|Global]] owned-and-operated station [[CIII-DT]] airs a program that is also seen on an American broadcast network, the Canadian broadcast is blacked out, or replaced with the signal of the American station carrying the same program at that time (note that this does not apply to most sports on cable, especially if they are different productions from one another, unless the league for that sport requests a blackout; [[Buffalo Sabres]] games carried on [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' and on [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]] can be seen on both channels).
** During an October 2008 dispute between [[LIN Media|LIN TV Corporation]] and [[Time Warner Cable]], [[CBS]] programming (most notably [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] games, including those featuring the [[Buffalo Bills]]) were blacked out in the Buffalo market as a result of LIN and TWC's inability to come to terms on a new contract. Despite this, [[WIVB-TV]] (a CBS affiliate owned at the time by LIN, it is now owned by [[Media General]]) was still allowed to enforce syndex and prevent other CBS affiliates or CFTO from being brought into the market. CFTO was allowed to carry games in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], [[WSEE-TV]] (out of [[Erie, Pennsylvania]]) in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], [[WBNG]] (out of [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]]) in [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]], and [[WROC-TV]] (out of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]]) in [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans]], [[Genesee County, New York|Genesee]] and [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming]] counties. Time Warner Cable customers in [[Erie County, New York|Erie]], [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] and [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany]] counties, whose only CBS affiliate is WIVB, were completely blacked out; in the latter two counties, because of terrestrial reception issues, antennas cannot be used, leaving satellite television (which still carried WIVB) as the only choice.
* A similar rule, [[simultaneous substitution]], exists in Canada, allowing broadcasters to require that U.S. feeds of shows airing at exactly the same time on a Canadian network to be replaced with the Canadian feed. This is intended to protect domestic advertising revenue that would otherwise go to the U.S. network.
* Sporting events that air on a national network such as [[ESPN]] are often blacked out in the markets of the teams that are playing, if a local station or [[regional sports network]] also has rights to the game. For example, a weeknight baseball game between the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] and [[St. Louis Cardinals|Cardinals]] carried by ESPN would be blacked out in areas that receive either team's local broadcaster. The [[National Hockey League]] utilizes a similar policy for non-exclusive national games carried by [[NBCSN]] or [[NHL Network (U.S.)|NHL Network]].In another case, ESPN's ''[[ACC Wednesday]]'' games are blacked out in markets that receive coverage of [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] basketball on local stations via [[Raycom Sports#ACC Network|Raycom Sports]]. In such instances, the ESPN feed is usually replaced with a simulcast of [[ESPNEWS]]. ESPN's most recent contract extension with the league, which went into effect with the [[2014 Major League Baseball season|2014 season]], virtually eliminated local blackouts during the network's Monday and Wednesday night games, allowing ESPN coverage to co-exist in the home markets served by each team's local broadcaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MLB, ESPN extend television contract|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57502391/mlb-espn-extend-television-contract/|work=CBS News|date=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[National Football League]] utilizes a similar rule for nationally-televised games carried exclusively by cable networks (such as [[ESPN]] and [[NFL Network]]). NFL policies require all games to be available on broadcast television in the markets of the teams involved, so rights to simulcast these games are typically syndicated to local stations in the affected markets, and the telecast on the respective cable network is blacked out to protect the local broadcaster that has syndication rights to these games.

==Some effects==
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, several independent local stations were uplinked via satellite so that they could be available either nationally or regionally, especially to markets that did not have independent stations, either because the market could not support one due to having lower population densities or because one simply did not exist. Three of those stations, [[WWOR-TV|WOR-TV/WWOR-TV]] in New York City (later moved to Secaucus, New Jersey), WGN-TV in Chicago and [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]] in [[Atlanta]], were available nationally. WTBS aired shows that were generally "syndex proof" (or, in simpler terms, having "full signal rights") due to program contracts that the station was able to negotiate so that it could avoid having any programs blacked out or substituted, save for sports programs.

In 1990, when the syndex law was passed, national versions of WWOR-TV and WGN-TV, which aired different programs from the local signals in their native cities, were launched. These feeds replaced programs that had syndication exclusivity claims in certain markets with syndicated programs to which no station held exclusive rights in any market. WWOR's national feed outside of New York City was branded as the "[[WWOR EMI Service]]" (the "EMI" referring to Eastern Microwave, Inc., the superstation feed's satellite uplinker). WGN-TV did not have to cover up as many programs as WWOR, and while WGN was able to carry programming from [[The WB]] network on its national feed from January 1995 (when its Chicago parent station also affiliated with the network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time Warner Takes Crucial Step Toward New Network Television: A pact with superstation WGN-TV gives it access to 73% of homes. Analysts say that will still leave gaps.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-04/business/fi-63860_1_time-warner|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 4, 1993|accessdate=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) to October 1999, WWOR was not permitted by [[UPN]] to carry that network's programming on the EMI feed. This negatively affected UPN as WGN's carriage of The WB temporarily filled holes where that network did not have a full-time or secondary carrier in some markets until the network found local over-the-air affiliates and later set up a [[The WB 100+ Station Group|cable-only feed]] in 1998. UPN's decision to deny WWOR permission to carry its programming nationally left open gaps in market coverage for that network in several large and mid-sized cities.

After the national version of WWOR ceased uplinking in January 1997 (after [[Advance Entertainment Corporation]] sold WWOR's satellite transponder slot to [[Discovery Communications]] to expand national coverage of [[Animal Planet]]), the New York City-area feed, which included UPN programs and other shows previously covered up on the EMI feed, was uplinked by the National Programming Service for exclusive distribution to satellite providers. That feed was discontinued in 1999 with its transponder space being turned over to [[Ion Television|Pax TV]], though Dish Network now carries the New York City feed of WWOR. WTBS was separated from the national feed of [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in October 2007, and now airs only Atlanta-cleared programming as WPCH (the Atlanta station remains a superstation in Canada, although some of its programming is instead substituted with a domestic network feed of the same program under simultaneous substitution regulations). WGN's national superstation feed, later branded as "WGN Superstation" and "Superstation WGN", would be renamed ''[[WGN America]]'' in 2007; by this point, the number of syndicated programs that WGN-TV both gained full signal rights to ''and'' aired on both the Chicago broadcast signal and the national feed had substantially decreased, with WGN America mirroring the former WWOR EMI Service in its scheduling. WGN's national feed was also separated from its parent station, except in name, and converted into a basic cable network on December 16, 2014, and as a result no longer carries any Chicago-area programming.&lt;ref name=FederWGNAComcast&gt;{{cite news|title=WGN America comes home to Chicago|url=http://www.robertfeder.com/2014/12/15/wgn-america-comes-home-to-chicago/|author=[[Robert Feder]]|newspaper=Chicago Tribune''|date=December 15, 2014|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B&amp;CWGNAComcast&gt;{{cite news|title=WGN America Converts to Cable in Five Markets|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/programming/wgn-america-converts-cable-five-markets/136444|work=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|author=Kent Gibbons|date=December 16, 2014|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syndex-free/full signal rights==
In any case, national superstations such as WGN were, in later years, still sometimes able to negotiate full signal rights for a syndicated program. Whether or not a particular program could be cleared for full signal rights depends on how it was originally sold to other television stations nationwide. For example, the repackaged ''[[American Idol Rewind]]'' was allowed to air on WGN's national "Superstation" signal by virtue of [[Tribune Entertainment]] (the now-defunct production and distribution unit of the station's owner, the [[Tribune Media|Tribune Company]]) being a majority partner as well as the distributor of the program.

Other studios can also allow full signal rights to superstations for its programming. For example, [[20th Television]] allowed WGN full signal rights to the syndicated version of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' as did [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]] with ''[[30 Rock]]'', and [[Sony Pictures Television]] used the same method for ''[[Seinfeld]]'' for TBS.

However, once one superstation's term of license on a program ends, it can enter into syndex restrictions. For example, for decades TBS had full signal rights to ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' until [[Viacom]]'s cable networks were able to negotiate new full signal rights in the mid-1990s (''The Andy Griffith Show'' at the time was distributed by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]], then its successor, [[Paramount Television]]). Today, [[TV Land]] has national rights to ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (now distributed through [[CBS Television Distribution]]), and under this new contract cannot be seen on any other national network or superstation, but it can still be seen on local over-the-air stations, as stations such as [[WRAL-TV]]/[[WRAZ (TV)|WRAZ]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] and [[WVTV]] in [[Milwaukee]] have done for decades (similarly, the broadcast rights to the program held by some local stations have prevented [[Me-TV]] from carrying ''Andy Griffith'' on many of its affiliates since it began carrying the sitcom in 2014). Broadcasts on these local stations are only restricted to their particular markets.

'''Taisia Anatolievna Kornilova''' ({{lang-ru|Таисия Анатольевна Корнилова}}) is a [[People's Artist of Russia]], circus performer, elephant trainer, screenwriter, director, artistic director of variety-circus programs. She holds several certified [[Guinness World Records]] for her achievements in elephant training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fakty.ua/40254-narodnaya-artistka-rossii-taisiya-kornilova-quot-takogo-v-kieve-ecshe-ne-bylo-slony-budut-progulivatsya-pryamo-po-krecshatiku-i-posmotret-na-nih-smogut-vse-zhelayucshie-quot|publisher=fakty.ua|title=Народная артистка россии таисия корнилова: «такого в киеве еще не было! Слоны будут прогуливаться прямо по крещатику и посмотреть на них смогут все желающие! »}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography and career==
Kornilova Taisiya Anatolyevna was born on May 19, 1961. Her parents are circus performers, trainers Anatoly Alexandrovich Kornilov and Nina Andreyevna Kornilova. Taisia, the representative of the dynasty in the third generation, began to perform in the circus from the age of 6 with the number "Girl Taya and elephant Maya".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal-kultura.ru/articles/matinee/3826-taisiya-kornilova-my-so-slonami-odna-semya/|publisher=Gazeta Kultura|title=Таисия Корнилова: «Мы со слонами — одна семья»|author=Felix Grozdanov}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the family of trainers was on tour in Riga, Taisia was first seen by her future husband Alexei Dementyev, who at that time was 6 years old. After many years in the same place in Riga, where Kornilov's program once again came on tour, Taisia and Alexey were students of the same school. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ruscircus.ru/16429/|title=Таисия Корнилова: «Цирк Никулина – настоящая Академия циркового искусства!»|publisher=ruscircus.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creative tandem of two young talented people turned out to be ideal: Alexei, in addition to animal training, was engaged in all administrative issues, Taisia, after graduating from the directing department of [[Russian Academy of Theatre Arts|GITIS]], took over the creative side of the program. The artists not only improved the attraction, showing in it a completely new presentation of animal training which met the requirements and style of the time, but also created their own tent-circus, with which they successfully toured in many cities and countries. Their elephants appeared in many famous movies, and the couple themselves in 2000 became the youngest People's Artists of Russia and received the state award of Moscow.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In 2000, the Kornilov family experienced a tragedy - Aleksei Dementiev died in a car accident. The circus show artists went on tour to Belgium, and Alexei fell asleep at the wheel, drove to the oncoming lane and died from a head-on collision. Goodbyes were bid to him twice - on the arena of the [[Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard]] where the same kind of farewell was held only with [[Yuri Nikulin]], and in native Riga.
Currently Taisia Kornilova is helped by her son Andrei in her creative projects, who became his father's successor. The most famous circus shows of Taisiya Kornilova are "Carnival of elephants", "On elephants around the world", "The mystery of elephants-giants", "New Year's stir", "Journey into the jungle". Almost all the premieres of the variety show Taisiya Kornilova are on the arena of the Nikulin Circus.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The '''Butterfly Club''' is a [[performing arts]] venue in [[Melbourne, Victoria]], [[Australia]]. Drawing from a growing interest in [[cabaret]], the Club was conceived and created by artist and entrepreneur, Matthew Grant. Grant lived and worked from the building from 1993: opening to the public in 1999. Grant sold the club in November 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news.asp?sId=52485 |title=Arts News, Commentary, Reviews &amp; Industry Analysis - ArtsHub Australia |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921102717/http://www.artshub.com.au/au/news.asp?sId=52485 |archivedate=2007-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006 the Club was [[Melbourne]]'s only full-time cabaret venue.&lt;ref name="chum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/come-to-the-cabaret-here-old-chum/2006/06/20/1150701552188.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1|title=Come to the Cabaret Here, Old Chum|accessdate=2008-05-06|date=2006-06-21|work=The Age | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Butterfly Club has presented more than 1,000 new works, with an emphasis on discovering and nurturing performers, many of which are now household names, such as [[Tim Minchin]] and [[Eddie Perfect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/play/entertainment-play/2010/12/20/butterfly-club-changes-hands/40551|title=Butterfly Club changes hands|last=Sheldrick|first=Drew|work=The Star Observer|date=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the stewardship of David Read and Neville Sice, over eight years the venue was saved and became sustainable using has an arts model which doesn’t rely on public subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.artshub.com/au/news-article/news/architecture-and-design/the-butterfly-club-changes-hands-183080|title=The Butterfly Club changes hands|date=21 December 2010|publisher=ArtsHub Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="samesame.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|title=New owners for Butterfly Club|last=de Jonk|first=Travis|date=20 December 2010|website=Same Same|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/local/6265/New-owners-for-Butterfly-Club.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; They established it as a premiere incubator for Melbourne performers and a key location for Melbourne’s burgeoning cabaret scene.&lt;ref name="samesame.com.au"/&gt;

The club, together with the [[Australian National Academy of Music]], has played a key role in developing the [[Melbourne Cabaret Festival]]. 
In January 2011 The Butterfly Club again changed hands to new director Simone Pulga. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/ipad/butterfly-club-spreads-wings/story-fn6bn9st-1225985226603|title=Butterfly Club spreads wings|work=The Herald Sun|last=Bennett|first=Sally|date=10 January 2011|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, The Butterfly Club announced a planned relocation to a central city Collins St building. In conjunction with this relocation, a massive fundraising effort through crowdfunding and social media campaigns, as well as media coverage, was launched under the cry to action 'Save The Butterfly Club.' &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/comedy/butterfly-club-floats-to-new-venue-with-a-little-help-from-its-friends-20121205-2avxn.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Butterfly Club floats to new venue, with a little help from its friends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a successful relocation, The Butterfly Club began trading from its new home, in the Melbourne CBD, in February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/after-metamorphosis-butterfly-retains-its-artistic-flair-20130214-2efl2.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=After metamorphosis, Butterfly Club retains its artistic flair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)''''' is a 2011 British-Dutch [[Black-and-white|black and white]] [[Exploitation film|exploitation]]-[[horror film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-centipede-2-full-sequence|title=THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 (FULL SEQUENCE) - British Board of Film Classification|website=Bbfc.co.uk|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; written, directed, and co-produced by Dutch filmmaker [[Tom Six]]. The [[sequel]] to Six's 2009 film ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'', the film stars [[Laurence R. Harvey]] as a mentally impaired English man who watches and becomes obsessed with the first ''Human Centipede'' film, and decides to make his own "centipede" consisting of 12 people, including [[Ashlynn Yennie]], an actress from the first film.

The film was subject to heavy [[The_Human_Centipede_2_(Full_Sequence)#Censorship|censorship]] throughout the world, where it was sometimes edited to remove objectionable content or banned altogether. It received generally negative reviews, with much criticism focused on its acting, plot and violence.

==Plot==
In the tollbooth of a multistory carpark in [[East London|east London]], Martin Lomax ([[Laurence R. Harvey]]) is watching ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'' on his laptop, a film he is obsessed with. Overweight, asthmatic, and mentally challenged, Martin lives with his overbearing mother (Vivien Bridson), who blames him for having his father put in prison for physically and sexually abusing Martin when he was a boy. Dr. Sebring (Bill Hutchens), Martin's psychiatrist, also touches him inappropriately and prescribes him heavy medication. Martin keeps a pet centipede, which he gleefully feeds insects to.

Martin acquires a dingy warehouse after killing the lessor and begins abducting people to use for his own human centipede. His victims include: an aggressive young man (Lucas Hansen) and his girlfriend (Emma Lock), two drunk girls (Kandice Caine and Georgia Goodrick) who catch Martin masturbating with sandpaper, a man (Daniel Jude Gennis) and his pregnant wife (this couple has a toddler, whom Martin leaves in the back seat of their car uninjured), and another man. Martin also catches Dr. Sebring and a cabbie (Gabe Kerr) having sex with a prostitute (Maddi Black), and proceeds to kill Sebring before abducting the cabbie and prostitute. When Martin's mother finds and destroys his scrapbook, Martin kills her by bludgeoning her head repeatedly with his crowbar until her skull caves in. He then lures his detested neighbour (Lee Nicholas Harris) to the scene, shoots, and kidnaps him. Martin's final victim is [[Ashlynn Yennie]], the actress who played "Jenny" in the first film (now playing herself, having been lured by Martin under the pretense of a film audition with [[Quentin Tarantino]]).

With twelve victims, Martin begins assembling his "centipede". He severs the ligaments in each person's knees to prevent them from fleeing and uses a hammer to knock out their teeth. He slices open the buttocks of one of his victims, causing him to bleed to death. In a quick change of plan, instead of actual surgeon tools, he uses a staple gun and duct tape to attach each person's lips to the next person's buttocks. During the assembly process, the pregnant woman is presumed dead; a grieving Martin places her in the corner. His "human centipede" is ultimately ten people long with Ashlynn in front.

After performing the crude procedure, Martin begins experimenting. Disturbed by Ashlynn's screams, he tears her tongue out with pliers. He then injects each victim with a syringe of [[laxative]], forcing each of them to explosively evacuate their bowels into the mouth of the person behind them. After pausing, he then wraps his genitals in barbed wire and rapes the woman at the end of his "centipede". As he finishes, the pregnant woman awakes and runs outside screaming, apparently in labour. She leaps into a victim's car and bears her child. She then gets onto the road, but as she starts the engine, she stomps on the accelerator, crushing the baby's skull under the pedal. She still manages to escape.

The neighbour rips his face from the person in front of him, separating the "centipede" into two halves. Furious that his centipede is ruined, Martin shoots all the victims, and when he runs out of ammunition, uses a knife to slit the throats of the remaining victims. As he advances on Ashlynn, he appears to give pause, and kneels in front of her. She punches him in the genitals, shoves the funnel into his rectum, and drops his pet centipede into it. In agony, Martin stabs her in the neck and staggers out. Ashlynn is seen slightly moving afterwards.

The scene cuts back to the tollbooth, with Martin watching the credits of ''First Sequence'' on his laptop, with exactly the same reaction as the initial scene. However, the toddler left in the car from the previous kidnappings can be heard crying in the background.

Director [[Tom Six]] stated in 2010 that he was working on a sequel to ''[[The Human Centipede (First Sequence)]]'', as well as a possible third film depending upon its success.&lt;ref name = "bloody disgusting tom six video interview"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20023 | title = Tom Six Answers YOUR Questions About 'The Human Centipede' | first=Brad | last=Miska | work=[[Bloody Disgusting]] | date = 29 April 2010 | accessdate = 8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the plot would follow on from the first film, but with a centipede made from 12 people as opposed to the three victims of the first. The tag-line would be "''100% medically inaccurate''", in contrast to his "100% medically ''accurate''" claim for the first film. Six stated the sequel would be much more graphic and disturbing, making the first film seem like "''[[My Little Pony]]'' compared with part two."&lt;ref name = "'guardian film weekly tom six interview"&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/audio/2010/aug/19/film-weekly-human-centipede-pianomania | title = Film Weekly hooks up with The Human Centipede and experiences Pianomania | author=Jason Solomons |work=The Guardian |location=London | date = 19 August 2010 | accessdate = 8 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation regarding the plot of ''Full Sequence'' grew after the [[Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors|Weekend of Horrors]] convention in May 2010, when [[Ashlynn Yennie]] and [[Akihiro Kitamura]], who had starred in ''First Sequence'', hinted that their characters might return for the sequel despite their deaths in ''First Sequence''.&lt;ref name = "dreadcentral-weekend-of-horrors-may-2010"&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37690/weekend-horrors-ashlynn-yenni-and-akimura-kitamura-return-the-human-centipede-ii | title = Weekend of Horrors: Ashlynn Yenni and Akimura Kitamura Return for The Human Centipede II | author=SeanD | work=Dread Central | date = 25 May 2010 | accessdate = 5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Ashley C. Williams, whose character was left alive at the end of ''First Sequence'', stated in September 2010 that she was shooting a horror film in Britain, which led to speculation from FEARnet that she is reprising her role of Lindsay.&lt;ref name = "fearnet-lindsay-speculation"&gt;{{citation | title = Part of 'The Human Centipede' Returning for Full Sequence? | url = http://www.fearnet.com/news/interviews/b20169_part_of_human_centipede_returning_full.html | author=Sara Castillo | work=[[Fearnet]] | date = 13 September 2010 | accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a further interview, Yennie confirmed Six's statement that the sequel would contain "the blood and shit" which viewers did not see in the first film.&lt;ref name = "dreadcentral-weekend-of-horrors-may-2010" /&gt;

Six was inspired to make the movie a [[metafilm]] after reporters kept asking him if he worried about people committing [[copycat crimes]] inspired by the first film.&lt;ref name="Threefinal"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|title=‘Human Centipede’ Director Tom Six Takes on Censorship, Critics: ‘I Like the People Who Hate It’|url=http://www.thewrap.com/human-centipede-director-tom-six-takes-on-censorship-critics-i-like-the-people-who-hate-it/|website=The Wrap|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he had previously considered the concept for a possible sequel, the questions cemented his idea.&lt;ref name="Threefinal"/&gt; 

According to Six, he intentionally made ''Full Sequence'' very different from ''First Sequence'' for two reasons. First, when he was writing the script of ''First Sequence'', he knew people would want more "blood and shit" than is shown. Second, the two parts reflect the different characters: the coloured ''First Sequence'', with a slow-moving camera, fit the story of Dr. Heiter, while Martin Lomax's character required a "dark and dirty" film. Six shot ''Full Sequence'' in colour, but "was always thinking about black and white" and realized while editing that it was "much scarier" that way.&lt;ref name="collider.com"&gt;{{citation | url = http://collider.com/tom-six-laurence-harvey-human-centipede-2-interview/118452/ | title = Fantastic Fest 2011: Tom Six and Laurence Harvey Interview THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2: FULL SEQUENCE | first=Scott | last=Wampler| work=Collider.com | date = 3 October 2011 | accessdate = 25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also Six's idea to have little dialogue in the film's second half, except for moans, screams, and whimpers.&lt;ref name="Saucedo"&gt;[http://insidepulse.com/2011/09/23/fantastic-fest-11-human-centipede-2-full-sequence-review/ Saucedo, Robert.

The film had its United States [[premiere]] at [[Fantastic Fest]] in [[Austin, Texas]], on 22 September 2011.&lt;ref name="Yamato" /&gt; The film's distributor, [[IFC Films]], gave audience members complimentary [[Airsickness bag|barf bags]] at the screening,&lt;ref name="Yamato" /&gt; and stationed an ambulance outside the theater as a [[gimmick]].&lt;ref name="Kohn" /&gt; However, one audience member became so physically ill during the premiere that actual paramedics had to assist her.&lt;ref name="Kohn" /&gt;

The film began a [[Limited release|limited theatrical release]] in the United States on 7 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifc.com/news/2011/09/human-centipede-2-full-trailer.php Singer, Matt.

In April 2016, a Tennessee high school teacher was suspended after the film was played during class. Tom Six responded by tweeting "It should be mandatory to watch THC2 in school classes...It deals with a character that is bullied and what to do!" Six also said that he would be giving the teacher an autographed copy of the film.&lt;ref name="highschool"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/29/human-centipede-2-high-school|title=Teacher suspended for showing high school class Human Centipede 2|website=Ew.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Censorship ===
==== United Kingdom ====
In June 2011, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) refused to classify ''The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)'' for a [[direct-to-video]] release, effectively meaning that the film could not legally be supplied in any format in the UK.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc/media-centre/bbfc-rejects-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence|title=BBFC rejects THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE) {{!}} British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBFC had given the preceding ''First Sequence'' title an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Board stated that they had considered ''First Sequence'' to be "undoubtedly tasteless and disgusting",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; but deemed it acceptable for release because the "centipede" was the product of a "revolting medical experiment".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By contrast, the BBFC report on ''Full Sequence'' stated that the film's content was too extreme for an 18 certificate and was "sexually violent, and potentially obscene".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The board members felt that the centipede of ''Full Sequence'' existed purely as "the object of the protagonist's depraved sexual fantasy".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They criticised the film for making "little attempt to portray any of the victims in the film as anything other than objects to be brutalised and degraded for the amusement and sexual arousal of the main character and for the pleasure of the viewer,"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-centipede-2-full-sequence|title=THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 (FULL SEQUENCE) {{!}} British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated their opinion that the film was potentially in breach of the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959|Obscene Publications Act]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The BBFC initially suggested that cutting the film would not affect the decision, "as the unacceptable material featured throughout".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Tom Six responded to the BBFC's decision in a statement released the next day:&lt;blockquote&gt;Thank you BBFC for putting spoilers of my movie on your website and thank you for banning my film in this exceptional way. Apparently I made an horrific horror-film, but shouldn't a good horror film be horrific? My dear people it is a f**cking MOVIE. It is all fictional. Not real. It is all make-belief ''[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[sic]]]''. It is art. Give people their own choice to watch it or not. If people can't handle or like my movies they just don't watch them. If people like my movies they have to be able to see it any time, anywhere also in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/human-centipede-ii-rejected-bbfc/|title=Human Centipede II Rejected By BBFC|last=O'Hara|first=Helen|date=2011-06-07|website=[[Empire Magazine|Empire]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Eureka Entertainment, the film's UK distributor, issued a statement criticising the ban, echoing Six's sentiments about the revelation of plot details in the BBFC's report, and announcing their intention to appeal to the [[Video Appeals Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.starburstmagazine.com/news-why-the-bbfc-dont-want-you-to-see-human-centipede-2|title=News: Why The BBFC Don't Want You To See HUMAN CENTIPEDE 2 With Response From Distributors - STARBURST Magazine|last=Heys|first=Kris|date=2011-06-07|work=STARBURST Magazine|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, the BBFC ultimately granted the film an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]] for "very strong bloody violence and gore, and sexual violence" after 32 compulsory cuts were made, totalling 2 minutes and 37 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bbfc.co.uk/releases/human-centipede-ii-full-sequence|title=THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE) {{!}} British Board of Film Classification|website=bbfc.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quentin Thomas|Sir Quentin Thomas]], president of the BBFC, stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;When we first examined this work earlier this year we judged that, as submitted, it was unsuitable for classification; and, as we explained to the company, we could not ourselves see how cuts could produce a viable and classifiable work. That remains the view of one of our Vice Presidents, Gerard Lemos, who is therefore abstaining from the Board's collective decision. The company lodged an appeal against our decision to refuse classification. In the course of preparations for that appeal, the company proposed a number of cuts which it was right for us to consider. In response, after further examination, we proposed a more extensive series of cuts. These cuts produce a work which many will find difficult but which I believe can properly be classified at the adult level. The company has now accepted these cuts, withdrawn its appeal and the work has been classified, as cut, at 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/about-bbfc/media-centre/bbfc-has-awarded-18-classification-cut-version-human-centipede-ii|title=The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) has awarded an '18' classification to a cut version of THE HUMAN CENTIPEDE II (FULL SEQUENCE), following 32 cuts. {{!}} British Board of Film Classification|website=www.bbfc.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The sales director of Eureka Entertainment supported the decision, stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;We are really pleased that after nearly four months of detailed discussion and debate, we have been able to reach an agreement with the BBFC and to produce a very viable cut of the film which will both excite and challenge its fans. Naturally we have a slight disappointment that we have had to make cuts, but we feel that the storyline has not been compromised and the level of horror has been sustained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/06/human-centipede-2-18-classification|title=Human Centipede 2 wins certificate 18 classification from British censors|last=Shoard|first=Catherine|date=2011-10-06|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film grossed $5,824 in [[Iceland]] and $1,511 in the United Kingdom. Released in [[Peru]] in April 2012, the horror picture grossed $21,111 there. At the end of its run, the film made $141,877, about half of what the previous installment had grossed.

===Critical response===
The film has a rating of 30% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 77 reviews, with a consensus that reads "''The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)'' attempts to weave in social commentary but as the movie wears on, it loses its ability to repulse and shock and ends up obnoxious and annoying."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|the_human_centipede_ii|The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)}} Accessed 20 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], it rates 17 out of 100, indicating "overwhelming dislike", based on 22 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|the-human-centipede-ii-full-sequence|The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giving it a score of 7 out of 10, ''[[Bloody Disgusting]]'' writer Brad Miska said the film was a "brilliant response to critics of his first film. It makes a strong statement that it's just a movie and that people take his work way too seriously, while also implementing a unique concept". Miska added that he "found it an intensely engaging and absolutely hilarious meta experience that gets its point across with flying colors", but was critical of the script's lack of depth.&lt;ref name="bloody disgusting thc 2 review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Miska|first=Brad|title=Review: The Human Centipede Part 2 (Full Sequence) (limited)|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/film/4823/review|work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|publisher=The Collective|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Owen Gleiberman gave the film a B+ rating, stating that viewers "may feel gripped by the horror of what you're seeing and the terror of what's coming". Gleiberman noted how "The scatological climax would have the Marquis de Sade gagging into his popcorn."&lt;ref name="EW THC 2 review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=Movie Review: The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20534454,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|accessdate=12 October 2011|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[New York Post]]'', V. A. Musetto gave the film 3 out of 4 and said ''Full Sequence'' "is sick, disgusting and vile. (but) It's also demonically funny, stylish and ingenious."&lt;ref name="nyp thc 2 review"&gt;{{cite news|last=Musetto|first=V A|title=Inhuman attachment|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/inhuman_attachment_X6W2IGCw3GrikUB13I23xN?CMP=OTC-rss&amp;FEEDNAME=|work=New York Post|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=12 October 2011|date=7 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jen Yamato, writing for ''Movieline'', criticized the film's excessive gore and the way director Tom Six seemed to dislike his own audience, specifying "It's not really a film one can or should 'enjoy', which is what Six seems to be telling his own audience, the fans who giggled through ''The Human Centipede'' and demanded more! Gorier! More extreme! Well, those people will get what they asked for."&lt;ref name="Yamato" /&gt; Eric Kohn, writing for ''indieWire'', criticized the excessive grotesqueness of the film as well as Six's vanity. He stated, "Well, what if it turns someone's own body against them—is that a measure of success? To some degree, yes; it's designed to turn the tables on its own gore-hungry fans by depicting a fictionalized version of one of their own so revolting they think twice about their twisted tendencies. But it's so indulgently perverse, and so viscerally disturbing to watch—not to mention a painfully vain exercise in self-worship—that the lesson is incredibly hard-won. Take a word of warning, if you're on the fence; you don't have to see ''The Human Centipede II'' to know you don't want to see it."&lt;ref name="Kohn" /&gt;

Some reviewers found the extreme nature of the film boring. Robert Koehler, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', found the gore so excessive that he termed it a form of lazy filmmaking. "More boring than stomach-churning, the film nevertheless contains scattered scenes and sequences so far beyond the tolerance of the squeamish that it can't be overstated; one, detailing the violent birth and death of a baby, is here simply to shock the most jaded of the jaded," he wrote.&lt;ref name="Variety" /&gt;

Reviewer Robert Saucedo of InsidePulse.com was more generous toward the film, but found its execution lacking. He wrote, "The film ... has a hint of intelligence hiding behind its beady little eyes. Smeared with blood and poo as it may be, this intelligence exposes a film that has something to say. The problem, unfortunately, is that director Tom Six is like a child – attempting to make a profound statement but unable to get it out eloquently or even in anything not resembling a whimper or a groan most of the time ... Who would have guessed? ''Human Centipede II'' is a treatise about horror fandom as delivered by a giggling, poop-infatuated toddler."&lt;ref name="Saucedo" /&gt;

Mark Olsen, film critic for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', expressed concern over the film's conclusion as well as its basic premise. The conclusion (which he admits is open to interpretation; did Lomax commit these crimes or not?) leaves the audience either believing that the film is a "cop-out repudiation of everything that has come prior" or that even more graphic torture is coming in the third film.&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-human-centipede-20111007-1,0,5524602.story Olsen, Mark. "Movie Review: ''The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)''." ''Los Angeles Times.'' 7 October 2011.] Accessed 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Olsen concluded that writer-director Six has left himself with no good option for the third film.

[[Roger Ebert]], of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', who did not assign a star rating to the original, gave this film zero stars on review, calling it "reprehensible, dismaying, ugly, artless and an affront to any notion, however remote, of human decency."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20111007/REVIEWS/111009982 Ebert, Roger.

In the UK, the reception of the film was just as hostile. Chris Tookey of the [[Daily Mail]] compared director Tom Six to recently convicted Dutch murderer [[Vincent Tabak]] to argue that such films would lead to the decline of society in a strong criticism of the [[BBFC]]: "That such obviously depraved, exploitative vileness has not been banned, but has instead been granted an 18 certificate, is yet more proof that the BBFC has lost its collective marbles". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2055937/|title=It's not just the internet that's full of violent porn - so are cinemas |publisher=Mail Online|date=1 November 2011|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Weinberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/sep/27/human-centipede-2-censors |title="Human Centipede 2": the censors saved you from a shockingly boring film |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 September 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Catherine Shoard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/06/human-centipede-2-18-classification |title="Human Centipede 2" wins certificate 18 classification from British censors |publisher=The Guardian |date=6 October 2011 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[The Guardian]] and [[Mark Kermode]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kermode |first=Mark |date=2011-11-20 |title=“Is it the end of life in the fast lane?: The all-conquering Pixar franchise stalls this time with the pedestrian Cars 2”  |work=The Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[The Observer]] praised the BBFC for heavily censoring the film, their only regret being that the BBFC could not make ''The Human Centipede 2'' into a "better" film.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Martin Ian (13 January 2015).

Six stated that the third film would again be very different from the previous entry, but would also start with its ending, making the trilogy similar to a centipede. In the end, the parts of the trilogy form one continuous film about four and a half hours long. He also stated that the third film would answer some "lasting questions", have a strange happy ending, and is the last of the series, as he does not want to make any more ''Centipede'' films.&lt;ref name="collider.com"/&gt; In an interview with DreadCentral.com, Six said the third film would "make the last one look like a Disney film. We're going to shoot the third film entirely in America, and it's going to be my favorite... It's going to upset a lot of people."

Around late 2012, actor [[Dieter Laser]] and Six ended their legal battle about creative differences, which had been ongoing since March 2012. Laser and Harvey returned for the third film, which is set in the United States, and played new characters. Six had said that the film would star a "big American celebrity," have "a storyline that nobody would expect," and feature a centipede consisting of 500+ people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rigney |first=Todd |url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/human-centipede-3-debuts-new-poster-at-the-american-film-market/ |title=Human Centipede 3 Debuts New Poster at the American Film Market |publisher=BeyondHollywood.com |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208183205/http://www.beyondhollywood.com/human-centipede-3-debuts-new-poster-at-the-american-film-market/ |archivedate=8 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an episode of [[BBC Radio 2|BBC Radio 2's]] [[The Russell Brand Show (radio show)|''The Russell Brand Show'']] broadcast on Saturday 18 October 2008, comedian [[Russell Brand]] and presenter [[Jonathan Ross]] made [[prank call]]s to actor [[Andrew Sachs]] that led to controversy in the United Kingdom. Brand and Ross called Sachs to interview him on-air; when he did not answer, they left a series of lewd messages on his answering machine, including comments about Brand's relationship with Sachs' granddaughter, Georgina Baillie. After initially receiving little attention, a 26 October article in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' led to widespread criticism of Brand, Ross and the editorial decisions of the [[BBC]], with the event becoming known as "Sachsgate" or "Manuelgate" (a reference to Sachs' [[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|character]] in ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/sachsgate-obscene-prank-calls-russell-9376380|title=Andrew Sachs was 'haunted' by obscene calls from Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross|last=Rutter|first=Claire|date=2016-12-02|work=mirror|access-date=2017-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand and Ross were criticised by a number of [[Members of Parliament]], including [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]], and the BBC received a record number of complaints. The BBC suspended Ross while it and [[Ofcom]] launched investigations. Both Brand and Radio 2 controller [[Lesley Douglas]] resigned from the BBC. On 30 October, the BBC suspended Ross without pay for 12 weeks. The BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/apr/03/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-bbc-fine|title=BBC fined £150,000 over Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross phone prank scandal|work=The Guardian|accessdate=3 April 2009|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
From April 2006 through to October 2008, [[Russell Brand]] presented the weekly BBC radio show [[The Russell Brand Show (radio show)|''The Russell Brand Show'']]. In most episodes Brand was joined by his co-host [[Matt Morgan (comedian)|Matt Morgan]] who would often steer him in certain directions regarding what to talk about. Brand sometimes called in a variety of his celebrity friends as well, including [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Alan Carr]] and [[Jonathan Ross]], to talk on the show each week.

On 11 October 2008, [[David Baddiel]] co-hosted Brand's show. Baddiel recalled having met Georgina Baillie at Brand's home and being told that her grandfather was actor [[Andrew Sachs]]. According to Baddiel, Baillie said "Don't tell him I was here!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC apologises for lewd phone calls by Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross|date=28 October 2008|work=[[The Times]]|author=Patrick Foster|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5022840.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prank calls==

On Thursday 16 October 2008, Sachs, who famously portrayed [[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|Manuel]] in television comedy ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', was scheduled to be a phone-in guest on Brand's evening radio show.  The show was to be pre-recorded due to Brand's work commitments.&lt;ref name="bbcApology"/&gt;

After being unable to reach Sachs on his home telephone, Brand and his co-host of the week, fellow Radio 2 DJ [[Jonathan Ross]], left Sachs four voice messages. In the first message, Brand joked about ''Fawlty Towers'' and the fact that both he and Sachs had appeared in ''[[The Bill]]'', but was interrupted by Ross shouting out "he fucked your granddaughter". The rest of the message and the following three messages were all characterised by Brand and Ross attempting to apologise for Ross' outburst, but each quickly descended into farce, with, for example, Brand singing to Sachs: "It was consensual and she wasn't menstrual" and Ross asking to marry him.&lt;ref name="bbcApology"/&gt;  Brand later said that listening to those calls is like hearing 'two idiots dancing towards a canyon.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4289499/Russell-Brand-jokes-about-Andrew-Sachs-scandal-in-new-comedy-gig.html |title=Russell Brand jokes about Andrew Sachs scandal in new comedy gig |work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London |first=Aislinn |last=Simpson |date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complaints==
On 25 October, Brand presented his last edition of his radio show with co-host [[Simon Amstell]], which they performed live. Shortly before going on air, Brand was informed that ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' would be running a story about the phone calls. During the show, Brand apologised to Sachs, but also devoted much of the show to deriding the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for its support of [[Nazism]] in the run up to [[World War II]]. Even in his apology to Sachs, Brand stated "what's worse – leaving a swearword on [[Andrew Sachs]]' answerphone or tacitly supporting [[Adolf Hitler]] when he took charge of the [[Third Reich]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/27/russell-brand-daily-mail-fawlty-towers |title=Russell Brand highlights Mail Hitler links in apology to Fawlty Towers star |date=27 October 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=John |last=Plunkett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident escalated into a media and political storm that, in much of the British media, eclipsed news of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]], the [[United States presidential election, 2008|US Presidential election]], and [[2008 Nord-Kivu fighting|fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC suspends top stars in media storm|date=29 October 2008|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|url=http://currentaffairs.ninemsn.com.au./article.aspx?id=657414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs later stated he had not given permission for the messages to be broadcast.&lt;ref name="Telegraph29Oct08"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3278635/Jonathan-Ross-and-Russell-Brand-suspended-by-BBC-over-Andrew-Sachs-calls.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|title=Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand suspended by BBC over Andrew Sachs calls|date=29 October 2008|accessdate=29 October 2008|author=Anita Singh | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC originally stated that they were "not aware of any complaint by Mr Sachs", but later confirmed a complaint had been received, and apologised.&lt;ref name="bbcApology"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7692911.stm|title=BBC apologises over Brand prank|date=27 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand issued an apology for making the calls&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7691641.stm|title=Brand 'sorry' for telephone stunt|publisher=BBC|date=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but stated it was "funny" during his last radio show, before the ''Mail'' had printed the story.&lt;ref name="bbcApology" /&gt; [[Ofcom]], the telecommunications regulator, announced its own investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rob Shepherd|title= Pressure mounts over Ross and Brand phone prank|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/10/pressure_mounts_over_ross_and_brand_phone_prank.html|work= [[Broadcast Now]]|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2008, the BBC said that it had received 4,700 complaints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7694921.stm|title=Ofcom to launch BBC Brand inquiry|date=28 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the calls became international news.&lt;ref name="NME29Oct08"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-killers/40721|title=Killers and Glasvegas caught-up in Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand's BBC ban|date=29 October 2008|work=[[NME]]|accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Times2 /&gt; Later the same day, this number had passed 10,000.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7694989.stm|title=Timeline: Russell Brand prank calls|publisher=BBC|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same afternoon, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] called the incident "clearly inappropriate and unacceptable".&lt;ref name="sack"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7696714.stm|title=BBC pressured to sack presenters|date=29 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day the number of complaints was said to have topped 18,000.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

This incident resulted in the second-highest number of complaints to the BBC in recent years, second only to its airing of ''[[Jerry Springer: The Opera]]''.&lt;ref name=Times2&gt;{{cite news|title=Tories demand Commons debate on BBC 'Manuelgate'|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=30 October 2008|author=Philippe Naughton|url=http://timesonline.co.uk./tol/news/uk/article5047594.ece|publisher=News International Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Offence record: The most complained-about shows|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 October 2008|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/29/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-complaints|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This could spell the end for the comedy of cruelty|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 October 2008|url=http://telegraph.co.uk./opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/10/30/dl3001.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the telephone calls, Baillie said that her relationship with Brand had been brief and she now felt betrayed that he had revealed it to her grandfather.  Baillie called for both Brand and Ross to be sacked by the BBC and stated that she and her family would be considering whether to make a formal complaint to the police.&lt;ref name="Telegraph29Oct08"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jemima Kiss|date=29 October 2008|title=Sachs' granddaughter calls for Brand and Ross to be sacked|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/29/russell-brand-jonathan-ross1|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs stated that he had no intention of making a complaint to the police or taking the matter further.&lt;ref name="Apology accepted"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7697988.stm |title=Sachs accepts presenters' apologies|publisher=BBC|date=29 October 2008|accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2008, [[Director-General of the BBC]] [[Mark Thompson (media executive)|Mark Thompson]] announced that [[Russell Brand]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] were suspended, pending the report of an investigation by [[Tim Davie]], director of BBC audio and music.&lt;ref name="suspended"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7696714.stm|title=Brand and Ross suspended by BBC|date=29 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC suspends Ross and Brand|author=Salamander Davoudi|date=29 October 2008|work=[[Financial Times]]|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c425fb84-a5b6-11dd-9d26-000077b07658.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suspension meant that, for the week, Ross would not be appearing on his regular ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' television show, [[Film... (TV programme)|''Film 2008 with Jonathan Ross'']], or his Saturday-morning [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] show. Similarly Brand would not be hosting his regular Saturday-night Radio 2 show or appearing as a guest captain on an episode of ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' due to be aired on 30 October; the episode had been taped before his resignation, and aired on BBC Two on 19 January 2011, more than 2 years after the incident.&lt;ref name="Telegraph29Oct08"/&gt; Thompson called the events a "gross lapse of taste by the performers and the production team" (who chose to broadcast the advance-recorded show) that angered [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|licence-payers]].  Thompson offered a personal and unreserved apology to Sachs and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7697354.stm|title=Brand and Ross: BBC statement|last=Thompson|first=Mark|date=29 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Sachs revealed that he had received and accepted written apologies from Brand and Ross.&lt;ref name="Apology accepted"/&gt; Brand resigned from the BBC later in the day.&lt;ref name=BBCBrandQuits&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7698417.stm|date=29 October 2008|title=Brand quits BBC over prank calls|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of 30 October it was announced that Controller of Radio 2 [[Lesley Douglas]] had tendered her resignation, which had been accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7700816.stm|title= Radio 2 boss quits over call row|date=30 October 2008|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her resignation letter did not address the question of whether Douglas herself had approved the pre-recorded show for transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lesley Douglas profile: Puppet master who shunned the public eye|author=Maggie Brown|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 October 2008|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/30/lesleydouglas-bbc|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day, Ross was suspended without pay from all BBC shows for a period of 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ross suspended for three months|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7700816.stm|publisher=BBC|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC issued an apology on 8 November, stating that the telephone calls were "grossly offensive" and a "serious breach of editorial standards".&lt;ref name=Barber&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5109646.ece|title=David Barber, BBC executive, quits after Brand Ross scandal|work=The Times|author=Nico Hones|date=7 November 2008|accessdate=7 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporation apologised specifically to Sachs and Baillie, and also to [[Television licence|licence fee payers]]. The evening before this formal apology, David Barber, head of specialist music and compliance at Radio 2, also resigned. Like Douglas,&lt;ref name=Notover&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7703870.stm|title=It's not all over yet|author=Torin Douglas|publisher=BBC News|date=1 November 2008|accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had been aware of the contents of the show, and had sanctioned the segment's broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/3400839/Radio-2-executive-resigns-over-Jonathan-Ross-and-Russell-Brand-prank.html|title=Radio 2 executive resigns over Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand prank|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Anita Singh|date=7 November 2008|accessdate=7 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions from politicians and the media===
Fifteen [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s signed a motion in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], tabled by Labour MP [[Andrew MacKinlay]] and Conservative MP [[Nigel Evans]], calling for Brand and Ross to no longer be funded by the [[licence fee#United Kingdom|licence fee]] (which funds the BBC). The chairman of the House of Commons [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committee]] on culture, media and sport, [[John Whittingdale]], stated that an investigation by the BBC was needed, but stopped short of calling for Ross and Brand to be sacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC should 'take some pain' for phone prank, says Will Wyatt|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Leigh Holmwood|date=28 October 2008|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/28/bbc-russell-brand|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chairman of the [[House of Lords]] Select Committee on Communication, [[Norman Fowler, Baron Fowler|Lord Fowler]], in a letter to The Times (see Fowler in [[#Further reading|Further reading]]) stated that there were fundamental flaws in the way that the BBC was regulated and governed, and that there was "confusion all round" because two parallel bodies, the [[BBC Trust]] and Ofcom, were investigating the incident, and it was both unclear which of them the public should complain to and which of them had precedence over the other.&lt;ref name=Times1&gt;{{cite news|title=Russell Brand falls on his sword and a sorry Ross is taken off the air|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|author1=Patrick Foster |author2=Philip Webster |author3=Adam Sherwin |author4=Charlene Sweeney  |last-author-amp=yes |date=30 October 2008|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk./tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5042843.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Jeremy Hunt]], speaking on the Radio 4 [[Today Programme]] on 30 October, also refused to say whether he thought Ross should be sacked, asserting that politicians should remain at "arm's length" from such decisions. In a speech at the [[London School of Economics]] the previous day he had criticised the decision by the BBC to broadcast the programme, which had been recorded 2 days prior to its transmission, saying that "[t]he BBC was quite wrong to take the decision to broadcast the offensive phone calls". He also demurred about calling for the resignations of anyone in BBC management, saying that "[i]t is wrong, in principle, for politicians to be calling for heads of individual broadcasting to be removed", and criticised the BBC for not releasing the name of the person who had given the green light for the show to be broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://walesonline.co.uk./showbiz-and-lifestyle/news/2008/10/30/steve-coogan-speaks-out-about-brand-and-ross-91466-22148936/|title=Steve Coogan speaks out about Brand and Ross|date=30 October 2008|author=Robin Turner|work=[[WalesOnline]]|publisher=Media Wales Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NewStatesman1&gt;{{cite news|title=Tory weighs into Ross/Brand row|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2008/10/ross-brand-bbc-hunt-public|date=29 October 2008|author=Brittany Peats|work=[[New Statesman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt was speaking to the LSE about socially responsible broadcasting, and stated "I do think the BBC is a socially responsible broadcaster, I just think we need to hear that."  He argued that broadcasters were not being ambitious enough, and outlined his party's plans, should it be elected to government at the next general election, to relax regulation for those broadcasters who agreed to provide only socially responsible output. In addition to citing the Ross/Brand/Sachs affair as a "perfect example" of where such a "responsibility deal" could have operated, he also pointed to [[Channel 4]] as an example, stating that it was "not good enough" for it to produce "worthy" programmes such as [[Dispatches (TV series)|''Dispatches'']] documenting alcohol abuse in the US, whilst at the same time it was broadcasting programmes such as ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' where such abuse took up, according to his estimates, 18% of screen time. The culture spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, [[Don Foster, Baron Foster of Bath|Don Foster]], criticised this idea, stating that it threatened the very foundational principles of freedom and independence of British media, arguing that such government interference in television programming would be "a very sad day for British broadcasting", and pointing out that regulatory mechanisms already exist to deal with issues such as this.&lt;ref name=NewStatesman1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tories mull responsible TV incentives|author=Ian Darby|url=http://brandrepublic.com./News/858123/Tories-mull-responsible-TV-incentives/|date=30 October 2008|publisher=Haymarket Media|work=Brand Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Responsibility contract' would threaten media freedom, say Lib Dems|author=Mark Sweney|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=29 October 2008|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|url=http://guardian.co.uk./politics/2008/oct/29/liberaldemocrats-television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October, Conservative MP [[Nadine Dorries]] had already called for the BBC to terminate the contracts of both Ross and Brand, and in the Commons [[David Hanson (politician)|David Hanson]] had criticised the comments for being inappropriate and not "in keeping with broadcasting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC on defensive and Ofcom steps in as 10,000 complain about Brand and Ross|author=Owen Gibson|date=29 October 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/29/russell-brand-jonathan-ross-bbc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative journalist [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]] announced he would not pay his television licence after the BBC's failure to sack Ross,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Moore [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/11/charles-moore-fined-tv-licence "The BBC was too scared to sack Jonathan Ross, so the obscenity goes on"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 22 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a decision which eventually led to Moore being fined in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;James Robinson [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/11/charles-moore-fined-tv-licence "Charles Moore fined for Jonathan Ross-inspired TV licence boycott"], ''The Guardian'', 11 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretary of State for Justice [[Jack Straw]], writing in his local newspaper the ''[[Lancashire Telegraph]]'' on 30 October (see Straw in [[#Further reading|Further reading]]), became the first Cabinet Minister to call for the pair to be sacked, arguing that if both presenters had worked in [[Independent Local Radio|local radio]] "they'd have been given their [[P45 (tax)|P45]] before you could say 'Jack Robinson'."&lt;ref name=Times1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/3801342.Sack_Jonathan_Ross__say_East_Lancashire_MPs/|date=30 October 2008|title=Sack Jonathan Ross, say East Lancashire MPs Jack Straw and Nigel Evans|work=[[The Citizen (Blackburn)|The Citizen]]|location=Blackburn|publisher=Newsquest Media Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, [[Theresa May]], called for a Commons debate on the BBC's handling of the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New exit in Russell Brand row as Jonathan Ross suspended unpaid|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk./tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5050293.ece|author1=Nico Hines  |author2=Philippe Naughton |lastauthoramp=yes |work=[[The Times]]|location=London|publisher=News International Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction against censures and suspensions===
In the days following the suspensions, a number of celebrities, particularly from television and radio, came out in support of Brand and Ross. Many felt that, whilst the incident was unacceptable, it was not deserving of the strong criticism it received, especially when there were other issues troubling the United Kingdom.

Rod McKenzie, the editor of BBC Radio 1 ''[[Newsbeat]]'', observed on the BBC Editors' weblog (see [[#Further reading|Further reading]]) that audience reactions to Brand's and Ross' remarks had been polarised, noting that whilst his colleagues at [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]], television, and the [[BBC World Service]] had been seeing one thing, the younger audiences of Radio 1 had been reacting quite differently, and were broadly supportive of Ross and Brand. Some were amazed at the comments of the Prime Minister, with one person observing that "[t]he financial markets are wrecked and all he can do is talk about a petty joke."  Others stated that people should "calm down", "get a grip", and that the subject had been "blown out of all proportion". McKenzie also characterised the reaction from the news media as containing "anger: some genuine, some of it synthetic. Some of it comes from the BBC's usual critics."  He stated that for the people who worked in the media "profile and salary-envy and [[:wikt:schadenfreude|schadenfreude]] may play a part in all this. But how many heard the original transmission and how many are responding to the newspapers' quotes or others' arguments?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Criticism of Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross driven by 'salary envy', says BBC executive|author=Nicole Martin|date=29 October 2008|url=http://telegraph.co.uk./news/newstopics/celebritynews/3280037/Criticism-of-Russell-Brand-and-Jonathan-Ross-driven-by-salary-envy-says-BBC-executive.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Shaw (presenter)|Tim Shaw]], disc jockey for [[Absolute Radio]], also supported Ross and Brand, appearing on BBC News wearing a T-shirt that read "I back Brand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com./International/Story?id=6139816&amp;page=2|publisher=[[ABC News]]|title=BBC Comedians' Joke Falls Flat|author=Gabrial O'Rorke|date=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television presenter [[Paul O'Grady]] stated that the comedians' behaviour was, "...well out of order". However, he also suggested that the Prime Minister should get on with more important matters than complaining about media gossip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= O'Grady: 'Move on from Ross and Brand'|date=30 October 2008|author=David Balls|work=[[DigitalSpy]]|url=http://digitalspy.co.uk./showbiz/a134098/ogrady-move-on-from-ross-and-brand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carol McGiffin]], a presenter on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[Daytime television|daytime]] programme ''[[Loose Women]]'' similarly supported the pair, criticising those who complained and stating that she could not wait to download the official [[podcast]] which included the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Loose Women]] |network=[[ITV1]] |airdate=27 October 2008 |minutes=60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then-[[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] leader and friend of [[Russell Brand]], [[Noel Gallagher]], complained that the press had "dictated the tone" of the controversy, and thought it "typical of the English in general" when "10,000 people get outraged, but only days after it has happened". Gallagher claimed to have spoken to Brand, who told Gallagher he was "going to fall on his sword".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oasis' Noel Gallagher 'outraged' at Russell Brand BBC scandal|work=[[NME]]|date=30 October 2008|url=http://www.nme.com/news/oasis/40735}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=30 October 2008|title=Oasis star backs radio pal Brand|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7699623.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Digital Spy]]|title=Gallagher 'outraged' by Brand resignation|author=Alex Fletcher|url=http://digitalspy.co.uk./showbiz/a134117/gallagher-outraged-by-brand-resignation.html?id=134117&amp;id=134117|publisher=Digital Spy Limited|date=30 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A petition on the GoPetition web site, calling for the BBC "to turn blame on the '[[Andrew Sachs]]' incident away from [[Russell Brand]] and [[Jonathan Ross]], and instead onto whoever green lighted the show" had garnered 336 signatures by 29 October. At the same time, a similar group on Facebook had over 1,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Petition supports Brand and Ross|date=29 October 2008|work=[[Web User]]|url=http://webuser.co.uk./news/news.php?id=270991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 30 October, the petition had risen to 4,000 signatures and the Facebook group to 15,609 members.&lt;ref name=Conlan1&gt;{{cite news|title=Brand-Ross Facebook supporters to protest outside Daily Mail|author=Tara Conlan|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/31/facebook-jonathan-ross|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2 November, the Facebook group had over 30,000 members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/No-laughing-matter-as-.4652344.jp|title=Have you heard the one about the gagged comedians?|last=Horne|first=Marc|date=2 November 2008|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=2 November 2008|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had risen to over 43,000 members by 5 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dancer in Sachs prank criticises BBC response|author=Owen Gibson|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=6 November 2008|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/nov/06/bbc-ross-brand-georgina-baillie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 October, fans of Ross and Brand protested outside of the offices of the BBC. On 31 October, fans prepared to hold a protest outside of the offices of the ''Daily Mail'' and of the BBC.&lt;ref name=Conlan1 /&gt;

Comedian [[Jimmy Carr]] also expressed his support for Ross, saying the issue had been blown out of proportion, and blamed the media themselves for escalating it further, and that Ross was a "national treasure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ross pulls out of Comedy Awards | date=31 October 2008 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7702309.stm | publisher =BBC News | accessdate = 31 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former celebrity publicist [[Max Clifford]] played down the apparent outrage aimed at Brand. In an interview he said "I don't think this will cause any problems for Russell Brand. He's known to be controversial and, if anything, it will make him more popular amongst his fans, who will have thought this was hilarious...They won't see anything wrong in what he did. It is a big PR success for him...He will have no problem with his career."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3288422/Russell-Brand-controversy-will-only-increase-his-popularity-experts-say.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Anita Singh|date=31 October 2008|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|title=Russell Brand controversy will only increase his popularity, experts say | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TV critic and columnist [[Charlie Brooker]] stated on his show, ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'', his worry that the controversy would lead to a [[Chilling effect (term)|chilling effect]] on comedy, and that the BBC and others would self-censor too much in future. He went on to say that the attitude displayed by the complainants and the BBC's backing down would have, in earlier times, precluded the production of much of what was at the time edgy comedy and made culture poorer for it (citing ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', ''[[The Day Today]]'' and ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' amongst others as shows that would have not been commissioned owing to their controversial content). While pouring scorn on those who had complained without seeing the programme, and attacking newspapers that attempted to stir up further controversy (in particular the ''[[Daily Mail]]''), he did not appear to defend Brand and Ross in particular, stating that the possibility of people being offended by some misjudged humour is "the price you pay for freedom of speech." In a further column in ''[[The Guardian]]'', he reiterated this point as well as saying that "people who retrospectively complain to Ofcom about material they've only read about second-hand are, in essence, a bunch of sanctimonious crybabies indulging in a wretched form of masturbation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Charlie Brooker's screen burn|date=29 November 2008|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/nov/29/charlie-brooker-screen-burn-tv | location=London | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC website"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7698477.stm|title= Prank row: Georgina Baillie's reaction|date=29 October 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ='publicityparadox'&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/30/russell-brand-ross-baillie-sachs |title=Georgina Baillie: the Satanic Slut at the centre of the Ross-Brand controversy |work=The Guardian |date= 30 October 2008|accessdate=22 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BroadcastFiveTV"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/10/five_to_air_doc_on_russell_and_ross.html|title=Five to air doc on Russell and Ross|work=Broadcast|date=31 October 2008|accessdate =2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7710341.stm|title=Radio 2 row 'out of proportion'|publisher=BBC News|date=7 November 2008|accessdate =7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction from Georgina Baillie===

====Interviews====
Reacting to the suspension of [[Russell Brand]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] on 29 October, Baillie remarked: "I'm thrilled because justice has been done...It's despicable. Calling me that in public, not only does it damage my relationship with my granddad but it could permanently damage my life as well," despite having declared apathy to the sentiment referenced in the latter sentence on her Myspace page.&lt;ref name="BBC website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="publicityparadox"/&gt;

A week later, on 5 November 2008, UK television channel [[Five (TV channel)|Five]] broadcast a 1-hour documentary on the incident, titled ''Russell &amp; Ross: What the F*** Was All That About?'' featuring an exclusive interview with Baillie.&lt;ref name="BroadcastFiveTV"/&gt; Baillie stated in the interview that "I think it's way out of proportion what's happened and I don't hate either of them – I don't at all", going on to say "I think they're really talented comedians and I think a world without [[Jonathan Ross]] and [[Russell Brand]] would be a very sad, dull place." She concluded by saying that Brand needed to learn about respecting women, while Ross should just think before he speaks, "I don't have any harder feeling than that."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Baillie also made clear that she would not object to the reinstatement of both Brand and Ross.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;

On 14 May 2009, Baillie was a guest on the BBC politics and current affairs programme ''[[This Week (BBC One TV series)|This Week]]''. She was questioned by host [[Andrew Neil]] and regular guests [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Diane Abbott]] about the Brand row within discussion of the general subject of the present day worth and genuineness of public figures saying sorry, in the wake of public apologies from members of parliament (MP's) and Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] following the events of the [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|MP's expenses row]]. Asked by Neil if receiving an apology from Brand and Ross had mattered to her, she said yes, as she had been "publicly offended and humiliated", and her father "had been humiliated too". When asked by Abbott if all the publicity surrounding the Brand row had helped her career, she responded "not necessarily ... one would think so, but not really." Neil further asked if the apology she received had helped, she replied yes, stating "definitely" to the follow-up comment from Neil of "better to get it than not get it?" When asked finally on the row by Neil if she thought the apologies from Brand and Ross were genuine, she replied that she thought Ross' was, but the fact that Brand had joked about the row on his later tour negated his apology.

====Songwriting====
In 2010, Baillie teamed up with singer [[Adam Ant]] (whose drummer Hayley Leggs had been a member, alongside Baillie, of [[burlesque]] troupe The Satanic Sluts) to compose the song ''Gun in Your Pocket'', about Ross, Brand and the entire affair. He intended to release the song as the lead single for his ninth album ''[[Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner's Daughter]]'' (with a rerecording of early 1980s outtake ''Who's A Goofy Bunny Then?'' as the B-side in tribute to the recently deceased [[Malcolm McLaren]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04165-adam-ant-interview-oasis-lady-gaga-madonna-punk |title=Features &amp;#124; A Wild Nobility: An Adam Ant Exclusive By Simon Price |publisher=The Quietus |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gun in Your Pocket'' was performed live on at least one occasion, at a [[guerilla gig]] (one of several he played around this time) at London's Troubadour Café on 2 April 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adam-ant.net/april10.html |title=April 2010 News |publisher=adam-ant.net |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-live-troubadour-last-night |title=Adam Ant Live at the Troubadour Last Night &amp;#124; Ant Lib Ønline &amp;#124; Adam &amp; the Ants Cømmunity Øutpost &amp;#124; Adam Ant News &amp; Events |publisher=Adamandtheants.org |date=6 April 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was setlisted, (but not performed) at Adam's ''Pirate Metal Extravanganza'' concert at the [[Scala (club)|Scala]] on 30 April 2010, while the recording received a club play when Adam DJ'd at the Family Affair clubnight in [[Shoreditch]], London on 24 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmantell.com/Family_Of_Noise/Adam_Ant_Live.htm |title=Adam Ant Live!

The single, along with its parent album, was put on hold when Adam Ant (who has a history of [[bipolar disorder]] and was widely suspected around this time to have been undergoing a [[Bipolar disorder#Manic episodes|manic]] episode)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holymoly.com/celebrity-news/adam-ants-comeback-all-delusion45650 |title=Adam Ant's comeback "all delusion" &amp;#124; Celebrity News |publisher=Holy Moly! |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712214236/http://www.holymoly.com/celebrity-news/adam-ants-comeback-all-delusion45650 |archivedate=12 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; was once again [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on 18 May 2010 and it remained to be seen if a medicated and stabilised Adam would wish to continue this project or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-news/adam-ant-sectioned-under-mental-health-act |title=Adam Ant Sectioned Under Mental Health Act &amp;#124; Ant Lib Ønline &amp;#124; Adam &amp; the Ants Cømmunity Øutpost &amp;#124; Adam Ant News &amp; Events |publisher=Adamandtheants.org |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, interviewed by [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] on 31 December 2010 Adam Ant – by his own admission once more unmedicated and now including Baillie on backing vocals in his live band – confirmed the song as still on the album. "Georgina is a friend of mine who has really been through it. Her grandad still won't speak to her because he is so hurt."&lt;ref&gt;Swift, Jacqui (31 December 2010). [http://www.adamandtheants.org/ant-spotting/sun-adam-ant-dont-bother-coming-my-shows "SFTW meets Adam Ant"] ''The Sun'' p50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gun in Your Pocket'' was finally released in October 2012 as the B-side to ''Cool Zombie'', the eventual first single from the album (which finally emerged in January 2013).  In addition to this song, Baillie and Adam Ant composed a second track about the Ross-Brand affair, ''Rubber Medusa'', a song focussed mainly on Brand and written from Baillie's perspective.  Baillie's band, the [[Fiona Bevan#Poussez Posse|Poussez Posse]], performed this second song regularly in live support slots for Ant's UK tours during 2011–2012.  Commenting on the two songs in an interview by [[John Robb (musician)|John Robb]], Baillie noted "The first one that Adam and I wrote was about an ex of mine- guess who! Which is not on the album, which is called ''Gun in Your Pocket'' ...(Subsequently) the first one Adam and I wrote together was ''Rubber Medusa'', which was about Russell, Adam came up with the title which is a quote from the [[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]] film, (Brand) does look like a rubber [[Medusa]] so I see why he said it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://louderthanwar.com/25352/|title=Georgie Girl and her Poussez Posse : interview|work=Louder Than War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for Lesley Douglas===
A number of radio personalities employed by the BBC came out in support of [[Lesley Douglas]], after her resignation. Douglas was aware of the contents of the programme, but had not heard them before they were broadcast. She sanctioned its broadcast with a single word e-mail of "Yes" sent from her [[BlackBerry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/25/lesleydouglas-bbc | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Lesley Douglas to join Universal Music | first=John | last=Plunkett | date=25 November 2008 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst her supporters were [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] and [[Terry Wogan]], both of whom worked for BBC Radio 2 at the time, and Dame [[Liz Forgan]], who called her one of the "outstanding broadcasters of her generation", and said that the BBC had "lost its wits". Mark Thompson said that because of her knowledge of the broadcast, she had to shoulder some of the responsibility.&lt;ref name=Notover/&gt;

===Subsequent appearances by Brand and Ross===
Ross had been scheduled to host the 2008 [[British Comedy Awards]] for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] during the period of his suspension from the BBC; however, on 31 October he stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ross steps down from awards show|work=[[Shropshire Star]]|url=http://shropshirestar.com./2008/10/31/bbc-suspends-jonathan-ross/|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Tara Conlan|title=Jonathan Ross pulls out of hosting British Comedy Awards|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/31/jonathan-ross-itv|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher='Guardian News and Media Limited|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 October, Brand left the country, saying that he had work to do in America, including TV programmes and film collaborations with [[Judd Apatow]] and [[Helen Mirren]].&lt;ref name=Notover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7703014.stm|title=Brand to film with Helen Mirren|publisher=BBC News|date=1 November 2008|accessdate=1 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second series of Brand's [[Channel 4]] television show ''[[Russell Brand's Ponderland]]'' aired as normal on the previous evening, attracting 1 million viewers, the show's largest ever audience. A further 180,000 watched the show time-shifted on the Channel 4+1 [[timeshift channel]]. The first series of ''Ponderland'', aired in October 2007, had been watched by 840,000 viewers, including those watching Channel 4+1. The channel reported that it had received 164 complaints from the public, many of these criticising the decision to broadcast the programme, rather than a reflection on the content, and the majority before the programme was transmitted; the show also attracted 212 emails and phone-calls of praise from fans and as such was the most praised programme screened on [[Channel 4]] for that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brand praised for Ponderland|publisher=broadcastnow.co.uk|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/11/brand_praised_for_ponderland.html|date=5 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holmwood1&gt;{{cite news|title=TV ratings: Russell Brand's post-Sachsgate TV debut bags 1m viewers|author=Leigh Holmwood|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=31 October 2008|url=http://guardian.co.uk./media/2008/oct/31/tvratings-russell-brand}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://digitalspy.co.uk./tv/a134243/brands-ponderland-draws-1m.html|title=Brand's 'Ponderland' draws 1m|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=31 October 2008|author=Neil Wilkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Channel 4 viewers unfazed by Brand|url=http://www.metro.co.uk./fame/article.html?Channel_4_viewers_unfazed_by_Brand&amp;in_article_id=382486|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=31 October 2008|publisher=Associated Newspapers Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand similarly continued to be on the front cover of [[PETA]]'s "Vegetarian Starter Kit" booklet, despite people protesting to the organisation. PETA's director, Robbie LeBlanc, said that Brand, who had previously won PETA's Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrity contest twice, would remain on the cover "because Mr Sachs, who is also a PETA supporter, has accepted Mr Brand's apology, and that's good enough for us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Russell Brand Wins Support of PETA Over BBC Prank Scandal|author=Jason Gregory|work=[[Gigwise]]|url=http://gigwise.com./news/47193/Russell-Brand-Wins-Support-Of-PETA-Over-BBC-Prank-Scandal|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nme.com./news/russell-brand/40766|title=PETA to stand by Russell Brand despite BBC ban|work=[[NME]]|date=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brand went on to win the British Comedy Award for Best Live Standup Performer. In his acceptance speech, Brand dedicated his award to Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brand wins British Comedy Award|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7769652.stm|date=7 December 2008|accessdate =1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being taken off the air due to Ross' suspension, ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' returned to [[BBC One]] on 23 January 2009, featuring guests [[Tom Cruise]], [[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]] and [[Stephen Fry]]. The show was watched by 5.1 million viewers, an increase from the 3.74 million of the last show before going off air. Ross' return attracted 25 complaints and 3 messages of support to the BBC.&lt;ref name="BBC24Jan09"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7849582.stm |title=Ross TV return is watched by 5.1m |date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=27 January 2009 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' was nominated for a BAFTA. According to ''[[The Times]]'', Ross was nominated soon after he was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foster|first=Patrick|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5971275.ece|title=BBC banned offensive Ross, then put him up for a Bafta|work=The Times|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', saying: "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it."&lt;ref name="DT BAFTA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Anita|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/5043185/Baftas-family-of-Andrew-Sachs-flabbergasted-by-Jonathan-Ross-nomination.html|title=Baftas: family of Andrew Sachs 'flabbergasted' by Jonathan Ross nomination|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=24 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sachs himself said that the nomination was: "a bit of a surprise", and that: "One would question the reasons when it comes so quickly after what happened. I wonder how much it has to do with trying to comfort him. I don't know. That is how it happens. That is showbusiness."&lt;ref name="DT BAFTA"/&gt;

==BBC Trust ruling==
On 21 November 2008, the BBC's watchdog [[BBC Trust]] said that the phone calls were a "deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification."&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationDeplorable"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm|title= 'No justification' for Brand show|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 21 November 2008|accessdate= 21 November 2008|quote=Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand's lewd calls to actor Andrew Sachs were a "deplorable intrusion with no editorial justification", the BBC Trust has said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust found that the existing BBC guidelines should have been sufficient to have prevented the incident, and that the "very offensive" programme should "never have been recorded."&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationFailures"/&gt; It found the failures lay in mistakes made by BBC editorial and compliance management.&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationFailures"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm|title= 'No justification' for Brand show|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 21 November 2008|accessdate= 21 November 2008|quote=Referring to the incident, BBC trustee Richard Tait said three main failures were made – in exercising editorial control; in following established compliance systems and a failure of judgment in taking editorial decisions. He said the furore could have been avoided if BBC management had followed the corporation's editorial guidelines. "It is a catalogue of editorial and management failures," he added. "It was a very offensive programme which should never have been recorded. Once the offensive phone call was made, the recording should have stopped and senior management alerted," he said. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust gave its backing to the BBC's response to the incident and Ross' 12-week suspension.&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationBBCActions"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm|title= 'No justification' for Brand show|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 21 November 2008|accessdate= 21 November 2008|quote=However, he said the trust considered the BBC's response to the controversy to have been appropriate. Asked if any further action would be taken against Jonathan Ross, Sir Michael said: "We are very clear that the director general has taken the right action with respect to Jonathan Ross."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoing the findings of the BBC Trust, the BBC itself stated the incident was a "very, very serious failure in a radio programme where editorial judgement was exercised that seriously let the BBC down."&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationDeplorableBBCResponse"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm|title= 'No justification' for Brand show|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 21 November 2008|accessdate= 21 November 2008|quote=The BBC said in a statement "It was a very, very serious failure in a radio programme where editorial judgement was exercised that seriously let the BBC down,"
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trust also criticised Brand's "so-called apology" of 25 October, and the staff of [[Chris Moyles]]' BBC Radio 1 show for also breaching BBC guidelines for comments by Brand in an interview on the morning of 21 October at a time when children were likely to be listening.&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationDeplorableBrandActions"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm|title= 'No justification' for Brand show|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 21 November 2008|accessdate= 21 November 2008|quote=Mr Tait said the offence of the original broadcast was compounded by Russell Brand's appearance on Chris Moyles' Radio 1 show on 21 October. He said this discussion, in itself, was also in breach of editorial guidelines in respect of privacy, offence and the fact it was broadcast at a time when children were likely to be listening. Mr Tait added that the trust considered Brand's "unacceptable, so-called apology" broadcast on Radio 2 on 25 October "exacerbated the intrusion into privacy and the offence". The trust ... recommended ... that there should be tighter controls on shows made by companies owned by their performers. Brand's show was made by his own firm.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust recommended tighter controls for programmes such as Brand's, made by companies owned by their performers.&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationDeplorableBrandActions"/&gt; Long-term effects of the controversy would include the setting up of a register of high-risk programmes.&lt;ref name="BBC21Nov2008NoJustificationDeplorableRiskResgister"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7741322.stm|title= 'No justification' for Brand show|publisher= [[BBC]]|date= 21 November 2008|accessdate= 21 November 2008|quote=Steps taken to ensure there is no repeat of the incident include creating a register of high-risk programmes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Thematic elements'''", or "'''thematic material'''", is a term used by the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and other film ratings boards to highlight elements of a film that do not fit into the traditional categories such as violence, sex, drug use and language, but may involve some degree of objectionable content.  This rating reason raises a warning to parents and guardians to learn more about a film before they allow their children to view it.&lt;ref name=MPAA/&gt; 

These thematic elements may include [[autism]], [[death]], [[disease]], [[discrimination]], [[self-harm]], [[wikt:defiance|defiance]], [[child abuse]], [[dysfunctional family|dysfunctional families]], [[driving under the influence]], [[sexually transmitted infection|STDs]], [[hatred|hate]], [[coming of age|coming-of-age issues]], [[crime]], [[corruption]], [[verbal abuse]], [[teenage pregnancy]], [[addiction]], [[disability]], [[hazing]], [[infidelity]], [[politics]], [[social issue]]s, [[abortion]], [[religion]], and other serious subjects or mature discussions that some parents and guardians feel may not be appropriate for their young children.&lt;ref name=MPAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Reasons for Movie Ratings (CARA) FAQ|url=http://filmratings.org/filmRatings_Cara/#/ratings/faq/|work=|publisher=MPAA|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==
Films with strong thematic elements include ''[[The Cider House Rules (film)|The Cider House Rules]]'', ''[[Zootopia]]'', ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'', ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'', ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', ''[[In Her Shoes (2005 film)|In Her Shoes]]'', ''[[I Love You Phillip Morris]]'', ''[[Finding Dory]]'', ''[[My Girl (film)|My Girl]]'', ''[[Hey Arnold!: The Movie]]'', ''[[Hop (film)|Hop]]'', ''[[The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (film)|The Curious Case of Benjamin Button]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Warrior (2011 film)|Warrior]]'', ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]'', ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'', ''[[White Oleander (film)|White Oleander]]'', ''[[42 (film)|42]]'',''[[Only Yesterday (1991 film) | Only Yesterday]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]'', ''[[The Fault in Our Stars (film)|The Fault in Our Stars]]'', ''[[Isle of Dogs (film)|Isle of Dogs]]'', ''[[The Secret Life of Pets 2]]'' and ''[[Wonder Park]]''. Mild thematic elements appear in many other PG and PG-13-rated drama and, primarily, documentary films.

'''''Tjioeng Wanara''''' ({{IPA-id|tʃiˈuŋ waˈnara|}}; [[Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System|Perfected Spelling]]: '''''Ciung Wanara''''') is a 1941 film from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day Indonesia) directed and produced by Jo Eng Seka. Starring R Sukran, [[Elly Yunara|Elly Joenara]] and AB Djoenaedi, it featured more than 500 people in supporting roles. The film follows a young prince named Tjioeng Wanara who must reclaim his throne from the cruel King of [[Galuh]]; it is adapted from the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] legend [[Ciung Wanara|of the same name]].

The second production by [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]], ''Tjioeng Wanara'' was released 18 August 1941. It was advertised heavily, emphasising the fact that the scholar [[Poerbatjaraka]] had served as the historical adviser and that the film was based on [[Balai Pustaka]]'s version of the legend. It premiered to commercial success, but received mixed reviews. This [[black-and-white]] production, which was screened until at least 1948, is now thought [[Lost film|lost]].

==Plot==
In 1255 [[Indian national calendar|Saka]], Permana Dikoesoemah is the King of [[Galuh]], beloved by his people and his wife Naganingroem. The minister Aria Kebonan wants power for himself, and persuades the king to surrender the crown to him. Permana Dikoesoemah warns Aria Kebonan to respect him always and not to bother his wife. He then abdicates to meditate, ultimately ascending to a higher plane of existence. Aria Kebonan, meanwhile, magically gains the king's appearance, ensuring that the people of Galuh are unaware that they have a new king.

Aria Kebonan proves to be an unpopular ruler. One day, he hears that both Naganingroem and the king's former concubine, Dewi Pangrenjep, are pregnant. With Dewi Pangrenjep, Aria Kebonan plans to eliminate Naganingroem's son. During childbirth the son is replaced with a dog, while Dewi Pangrenjep takes the newborn and throws him into a river. He is later found and rescued by farmers, who name him Tjioeng Wanara. Dewi Pangrenjep, meanwhile, gives birth to a son, Aria Banga.

Years pass, and Tjioeng Wanara grows to be a strong young man. Aria Banga, meanwhile, has taken over the throne and rules with an iron fist, hated and feared by his people. Tjioeng Wanara returns to Galuh and overthrows the king, arresting Aria Kebonan and Dewi Pangrenjep; Aria Banga, however, is able to escape and establish the kingdom of [[Majapahit]]. Tjioeng Wanara rules kindly over his people and later moves his capital to [[Pajajaran]].{{sfn|Fientje|1941|p=49}}

==Production==
[[File:Tjioeng Wanara Pertjatoeran Doenia June 1941 p48 1.jpg|thumb|A production still from the film, showing many supporting actors]]
''Tjioeng Wanara'' was directed and produced by Jo Eng Sek for [[Star Film (Dutch East Indies company)|Star Film]]. It was the second production by both Jo and the company, following ''[[Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman]]'' in 1941.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=234}} [[Poerbatjaraka]], a scholar of traditional literature, served as the historical adviser to the production.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Tjioeng Wanara}} Cinematography for the [[black-and-white]] film was handled by Chok Chin Hsien.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit}} By June 1941 production was almost complete.{{sfn|Fientje|1941|p=48}}

The film starred R Sukran, [[Elly Yunara|Elly Joenara]], AB Djoenaedi, Muhamad Arief, and [[S Waldy]].{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Tjioeng Wanara}} Waldy had made his film debut in 1940's ''[[Zoebaida]]'' for Oriental Film Company, later joining Star for ''Pah Wongso'';{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=488}} Joenara and Arief had begun their cinema careers in the latter film.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=246}} ''Tjioeng Wanara'' featured the first on-screen performances by Djoenaedi and Sukran.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Sukran}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djoenaedi}} The stars were supported by over 500 [[Extra (acting)|extras]] and actors in [[bit part]]s.{{sfn|Fientje|1941|p=48}} As such, JB Kristanto's ''Katalog Film Indonesia'' records the production as the first "colossal" film in the Indies, in terms of scale.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Tjioeng Wanara}}

''Tjioeng Wanara'' was based on a [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] legend [[Ciung Wanara|of the same name]], retold by M. A. Salmoen in a 1938 [[Balai Pustaka]]-published edition which was then adapted by [[Rd Ariffien]];{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=234}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Tjioeng Wanara}} as such, a review in the ''[[Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad]]'' found that the film contained little of the original tale except for the characters' names. The film featured traditional arts such as the [[Serimpi|Serimpi dance]].{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Filmaankondiging Orion}}

==Release and reception==
Though initially slated for a July 1941 release,{{sfn|Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film 1941, Warta dari Studio}} ''Tjioeng Wanara'' ultimately premiered at the Orion Theatre in Batavia (now [[Jakarta]]) on 18 August 1941.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Filmaankondiging Orion}} It was publicised extensively,{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Tjioeng Wanara}} often emphasising the role of Poerbatjaraka and using the name of Balai Pustaka, the official publishing house of the Dutch East Indies government known for its printed versions of traditional tales, in advertisements.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Filmaankondiging Orion}} The film was rated for all ages.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, (untitled)}}

The premiere of ''Tjioeng Wanara'' was shown to a packed theatre.{{sfn|Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad 1941, Filmaankondiging Orion}} Reception of the film, however, was mixed. An anonymous review in the ''[[Soerabaijasch Handelsblad]]'' was positive, considering the film to be successful in its adaptation of the legend,{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna 1}} while another, in the same newspaper, recommended it.{{sfn|Soerabaijasch Handelsblad 1941, Sampoerna 2}} Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]], however, writes that some viewers considered the film "nothing more than a stage play brought to the silver screen".{{efn|Original: "''tidak lain dari wayang orang atau ketoprak yang dipindahkan ke layar perak''"}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=276}}

==Legacy==
Star made four further films before it was closed in 1942, when the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupied the Indies]]; Jo Eng Sek did not direct again.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=234}} After writing ''Tjioeng Wanara'', Ariffien left Star Film to work at a circus; Biran writes that he was disappointed over the work's poor reception.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=276}} Joenara, Arief, and Waldy remained in the film industry; Joenara went on to be a producer,{{sfn|Apa Siapa|1999|p=175}} while Arief and Waldy later took up directing.{{sfn|Biran|1979|p=489}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Arief}} Neither Djoenaedi nor Sukran are recorded as making another film.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Sukran}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djoenaedi}}

''Tjioeng Wanara'' was screened as late as June 1948,{{sfn|Pelita Rakjat 1948, (untitled)}} though it is now likely [[lost film|lost]]. Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable [[nitrate film]], and after a fire destroyed much of [[Produksi Film Negara]]'s warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed.{{sfn|Biran|2012|p=291}} As such, American visual anthropologist [[Karl G. Heider]] suggests that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost.{{sfn|Heider|1991|p=14}} However, Kristanto records several as having survived at [[Sinematek Indonesia]]'s archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the [[Netherlands Government Information Service]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=351}}

The film was released on [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] in the United States on February 23, 2010.

==Plot==
Bobby Kalinowski (Rob Van Dam), is a former [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy Seal]] enjoys a peaceful life as a [[landscape]] [[architect]] in [[Louisiana]] with his family. After receiving an invitation from new neighbors Clay Freeman (Edrick Browne) and Elise Freeman (Ava Santana), they go out for a night on the town to a famous club. The evening soon takes a turn for the worse when Bobby gets into a conflict with one of the club owners, named Ethan Bordas (Ross Britz). In the middle of the conflict, Ethan accidentally falls and is stabbed by his own knife, while fighting with Bobby, who was defending his wife.

Seeking revenge, Ethan's father Seth Bordas (Jerry Katz), previously thought to be his older brother, puts a $100,000 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Bobby's head. Also making matters difficult, Bobby is unable to receive help from the law, for Seth has Clay Freeman, and a corrupt police sergeant, working for him. Now Bobby must survive and escape Louisiana while being hunted by criminals, corrupt law, and many others in the city. To protect his family and neighbors, Bobby decides to separate himself from them and goes to his Navy Seal colleague Big Ronnie (David Bautista) (or known as B.R.) for help. B.R. initially refuses, deciding to take the bounty, but later changes his mind and helps Bobby. Seth targets Bobby’s family and kidnaps his 16-year-old daughter Brianna (Brooke Frost).
