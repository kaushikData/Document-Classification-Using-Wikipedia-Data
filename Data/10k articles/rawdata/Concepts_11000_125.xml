      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7710">'''Behavioral ethics''' is a new field of [[social science|social scientific]] research that seeks to understand how people actually behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas.&lt;ref&gt;Bazerman, Max H. and Tenbrunsel, Ann E. "Blind Spots: Why we fail to do what's right and what to do about it". Princeton University Press, 2011, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intro to Behavioral Ethics - Ethics Unwrapped - UT Austin|url = http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/video/introduction-to-behavioral-ethics|website = Ethics Unwrapped|accessdate = 2015-11-04|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to behavior that is judged according to generally accepted norms of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, Linda K., Weaver, Gary R., and Reynolds, Scott J. "Behavioral Ethics in Organizations: A review". Journal of Management, 2006, p. 952.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = June 27, 2014 ~ Behavioral Ethics {{!}} June 27, 2014 {{!}} Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/2014/06/27/june-27-2014-behavioral-ethics/23445/|website = Religion &amp; Ethics NewsWeekly|accessdate = 2015-11-05|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ethics in different fields ==

=== Behavioral ethics and education ===
In ethics teaching and research, ethics is arguably the "next big thing" because its ï¿½investigation agenda has generated many knowledge on why and how people choose and act when being confronted with ethical subject, which was unknown previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Teaching-Behavioral-Ethics-by-Robert-A.-Prentice.pdf|title = Teaching behavioral ethics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Robert|first = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics and Rational Actor Model ===
Philosophical views about morality has been supported traditionally by theoretical reasoning and introspection, with at best passing reference to actual human behavior. Models of human morality advanced by behavioral ethics based on the fact that morality is a new and still developing quality of the evolutionary dynamic that leads to our species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/BehavioralEthics.pdf|title = Behavioral Ethics|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Herbert|first = Gintis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics Meets Behavioral Law and Economics ===
Clarifying the difference between behavioral law and economics(BEL) and behavioral ethics(BE) is of importance. Compared to BLE, BE has reduced its ability of influencing broad legal academic circles. In addition, unlike BLE, BE was advanced as piece of the management literature, which is less related to legal scholarship than BLE is, and thus less likely to have impact on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioral Ethics Meets Behavioral Law and Economics|ssrn = 2226711|date = 2013-10-03|location = Rochester, NY|first = Yuval|last = Feldman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behavioral Ethics and Justice ===
Behavioral ethics researchers have found the relationship between employees' justice perceptions and also, ethical and unethical behavior. In the 1990s, organizational justice became one of the most studied organizational themes. The term organizational justice is created by Greenberg(1987) to involve employee's perception of organizational events, policies, and practices as being fair or not fair. Classic work on distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice has been built. This research has focused on theoretical advance and empirical testing about the formation of justice judgements as well as the result of these justice evaluation. Justice and injustice perception have been related to an extensive variety of employee attitudes and behaviors consisted of trust, satisfaction, turnover and plenty of opposite formal negative behaviors such as theft and unethical behaviors which are more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nipc.ir/uploads/m099_12051.pdf|title = Behavioral Ethics in Organizations: A Review|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
There are experiments that can be linked to behavioral ethics. The [[Trolley problem]] and the [[Prisoner's dilemma]] both place individuals in decision-making situations that carry ethical questions. In each, an individual is asked to make a decision that affects another person. In the [[prisoner's dilemma]], the principles of [[Reciprocity (social psychology)]] and [[Cooperation]] come into play, but not all who participate behave in the same manner. In the [[Trolley problem]] an individual has to choose which group of people to save. Both of these experiments shed light on how people behave when confronted with ethical dilemmas.

== The impact of behavioral ethics ==
If firms are able to utilize the principles of behavioral psychology to alter consumer's behavior and thus increase sales and governments can change people's behavior and hence promote policy target using those same principles, then individuals and their employers can apply related principles of behavioral ethics to promote ethical behavior in the company and in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Behavioral Ethics: Can It Help Lawyers (and Others) Be Their Best Selves?|ssrn = 2424249|date = 2014-04-12|location = Rochester, NY|first = Robert A.|last = Prentice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of Unethical behavior in Business ==
According to an article in the Chron.com, examples of unethical behavior in business an environment can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-unethical-behavior-workplace-10092.html|title=Examples of Unethical Behavior in the Workplace|last=|first=|date=January 31, 2018|work=Chron.com|access-date=2018-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Deliberate Deception
# Violation of Conscience
# Failure to Honor Commitments
# Unlawful Conduct
# Disregard of Company Policy

These behaviors are mostly based on different rights that we all have in society and therefore have in work environments as well. Usually each company have its own set of policy but there are some common ones as well. 

== Examples of Ethical Behavior in Business Meetings ==
At most business conference, employees are required to report on the progress of their missions. It can lead to an ethical dilemma because they may report their performance better than it is due to external pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Ethical Behavior in Business Meetings|url = http://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-ethical-behavior-business-meetings-21680.html|website = Small Business - Chron.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unethical behavior ==
Unethical behavior is an action that falls outside of what is thought morally appropriate for a person, a job or a company. Individuals can act unethically, as can businesses, professionals and politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Examples of Unethical Behavior|url = http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-unethical-behavior.html|website = YourDictionary|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unethical behavior in business ===
Ethics can be defined as going beyond what is legal and doing right things, even no one is paying attention to. So unethical behavior in business is about actions that don't obey the acceptable criterion of business operations, failing to do right things in each condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unethical Behavior in Business: Definition &amp; Examples - Video &amp; Lesson Transcript {{!}} Study.com|url = http://study.com/academy/lesson/unethical-behavior-in-business-definition-examples.html|website = Study.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research background ==
The behavioural synchrony model universe relies on two key sets of assumptions. The first set of assumptions concerns the structure of the network: it is assumed that (a) the agents form a [[social network]] in a way that the network is connected, i.e., all agents have some direct or indirect connection to every other agent, and [[Sparse network|sparse]], i.e., the network the agents form is not fully connected; and (b) all agents have the same [[Degree (graph theory)|network degree]], i.e., every agent is connected to the same number of other agents. In network science terms, the assumption is that the agents form a ''k''-regular ''n''-sized connected graph, where ''k'' is the degree of the agents, and ''n'' is the number of agents. The second set of assumptions concern the nature of coordination: it is assumed that the content of the coordination is not important (independent of whether it is a linguistic cue, cultural identity, or simple compass direction), but is set up in a way that the agents cannot guess the location of the final convergence point of the group from any individual information exchange. These assumptions cause coordination to slow, where the speed is dependent on the network structure, and the agents need to think hard during the coordination process.

The behavioural synchrony approach introduced behavioural realism into social network coordination, via assuming that the network structure is similar to actual human groups, and by making the coordination process not-trivial, and thus making the modelled group processes reflect [[Human behavior|human behaviour]]. The behavioural synchrony approach has led to a range of human application, especially concerning the human evolutionary past:
* Synchronisation of physical activity, especially of exertion, contributes to group bonding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Social hierarchy can be beneficial for collective action,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but can lead to stratification and elite delineation that is harmful for collective action.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = DÃ¡vid-Barrett|first = TamÃ¡s|last2 = Dunbar|first2 = R.

* Supernatural beliefs, especially when mediated by a priestly cast, can increase the efficiency of large but not small groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = DÃ¡vid-Barrett|first = TamÃ¡s|last2 = Carney|first2 = James|date = 2016-10-01|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|volume = 6|issue = 4|pages = 307â317|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|issn = 2153-599X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increased brain size during human evolution only leads to increased cooperation efficiency if associated with increased complexity of communication, in particular with language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* All lasting human societies must have found a solution to regulate social inequality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Bellingcat''' (also rendered '''bellÂ¿ngcat''') is a website founded by the British [[citizen journalist]] [[Eliot Higgins]]. Bellingcat publishes the findings of citizen journalist investigations into war zones and the [[criminal underworld]]. The site's contributors also publish guides to their techniques, as well as [[case studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/about/|title=About - bellingcat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellingcat began as an investigation of the use of weapons in the [[Syrian civil war]]. It first received international attention with its analysis of forged data on satellite images of the downing of the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] during the still ongoing [[War in Donbass|war in eastern Ukraine]].

==Name==
The name derives from the idiom "[[belling the cat]]", which comes from a medieval fable about mice who discuss how to make a cat harmless. One suggests hooking a bell around his neck, and all the mice support the idea but none is willing to do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/To+bell+the+cat |title=To bell the cat - definition of To bell the cat by The Free Dictionary |website=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In March 2012, Eliot Higgins started a blog under the pseudonym Brown Moses, through which he published his research into video footage of the [[Syrian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brown-moses.blogspot.de/2012_03_01_archive.html |title=Brown Moses Blog: March 2012 |website=Brown-moses.blogspot.de |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He looked at hundreds of these short clips on the Internet, localized them, and examined details of the weapons used. As a result, Higgins was able to demonstrate that the Syrian regime was using [[cluster munition]]s and [[chemical weapon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/254405/kickstarter-funded-journalists-found-an-isil-training-camp-using-google-earth-and-bing-maps/|title=Kickstarter-funded journalists found an ISIL training camp using Google Earth and Bing Maps|date=24 August 2014|quote=for proving Syria was using chemical weapons from his bedroom in Leicester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Higgins linked the significant [[chemical attack]] in [[Ghouta]] (the [[Ghouta chemical attack]]) to [[Bashar al-Assad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/bellingcat_brown_moses.php|title=Watch out for Bellingcat|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Bellingcat was launched, major ground was covered over the course of its first investigation, the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] (MH17). Bellingcat concluded that the downing was initiated by the Russian military; this was later confirmed by the Joint Investigation Team (JIT), which found in a report dated 25 May 2018 that the downing of MH17 was initiated by the Russian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.om.nl/onderwerpen/mh17-vliegramp/@103183/update-criminal/|title=Update in criminal investigation MH17 disaster|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other notable investigations using [[Google Earth]], analysts from Bellingcat said that they had discovered the coordinates of an [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] training camp, as well as the site where an American journalist was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1278239551/bellingcat-the-home-of-online-investigations|title=Bellingcat: the home of online investigations|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kristyan Benedict]], an [[Amnesty International]] campaign manager, told ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in 2013 that many organisations had analysts but that Higgins was faster than many established investigation teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Batuman |first=Elif |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/11/25/rocket-man-2 |title=Rocket Man |publisher=[[The New Yorker]] |date=23 November 2013|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higgins launched the Bellingcat platform in 2014 with the help of private donations received through the crowdfunding platform [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Beauman |first1=Ned |title=How to Conduct an Open-Source Investigation, According to the Founder of Bellingcat |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2018-08-30 |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-to-conduct-an-open-source-investigation-according-to-the-founder-of-bellingcat |issn=0028-792X |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of funding comes from grants and donations, the other half from running workshops training people in the art of open-source investigations.&lt;ref name=millard&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/uk-leads-way-skripal-case-online-savvy-033611412.html |title=UK site leads the way in Skripal case with online savvy |work=AFP |via=[[Yahoo!

As of 2018, the company has four full-time staff plus Higgins, 11 members of its investigation team and 60 contributors.&lt;ref name=millard/&gt; The office is in [[Leicester]].&lt;ref name=millard/&gt;

==Notable cases==
===War in eastern Ukraine===
{{main|War in Donbass}}
On 21 December 2016, a report by Bellingcat was published which analyses the use of Russian artillery in the summer of 2014 against Ukrainian villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ArtilleryAttacks_withCover_EmbargoNote.pdf |format=PDF |title=Putin's Undeclared War : Summer 2014 : Russian Artillery Strikes Against Ukraine |author1=Sean Case |author2=Klement Anders |website=Bellingcat.com |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MH17===
[[File:MH17 map-lv.svg|thumb|351x351px|Route of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on July 17, 2014 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.]]

On July 17, 2014 [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], a passenger flight from [[Amsterdam]] to [[Kuala Lumpur]], was shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine. All 283 passengers and 15 crew members died after the Boeing 777 was hit by a burst of "high-energy objects".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/09/world/europe/netherlands-ukraine-mh17-report/index.html |title=Report: MH17 hit by burst of 'high-energy objects' |author=Jethro Mullen|publisher=CNN|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press conference, Russian officials blamed the flight's destruction on Ukrainian forces and presented radar data, expert testimony and a satellite image. The radar data that showed another aircraft in the vicinity of MH17 was debunked as falling debris from MH17 by experts. A Spanish air traffic controller in Kiev gave interviews that stated that two Ukrainian fighter jets followed the Malaysian plane but the Spanish Embassy later said that there was no Spanish air traffic controller at either of Kiev's airports. The satellite image showed an aircraft firing on the airliner but Bellingcat exposed the photo as a composite of Google images, with the Malaysian airline logo even being misplaced.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2015/07/03/meet-eliot-higgins-putins-mh17-nemesis-345485.html|title=Meet Eliot Higgins, Putinâs MH17 Nemesis|author=Maxim Tucker |date=2015-06-22|website=Newsweek|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2014, the Bellingcat MH17 Investigation team published a report titled âMH17: Source of the Separatistsâ Bukâ. Based on evidence from open sources, primarily social media, the report links a Buk missile launcher that was filmed and photographed in eastern Ukraine on July 17 to the downing of the MH17 flight. The 35 page report, including photographs and maps, details the movements of the Buk in eastern Ukraine on July 17, evidence that the Buk originated from the [[53rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade]] in Kursk, Russia, along with a convoy headed towards the Ukrainian border, and the activity of the vehicles seen in the same convoy after July 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Origin-of-the-Separatists-Buk-A-Bellingcat-Investigation1.pdf|title=Origin of the Seperatists' Buk|last=Bellingcat|first=|date=November 9, 2014|website=Bellingcat|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This report was later echoed by the Dutch-led international [[Joint Investigation Team]]. The head of the Netherlandsâ National Crime Squad, said they officially concluded that the missile that shot down MH17 "is from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade from Kursk in the Russian Federation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/investigators-russian-military-missile-downed-flight-mh17/2018/05/24/5b807ac2-5f34-11e8-b656-236c6214ef01_story.html?noredirect=on|title=Probe: Missile that downed MH17 came from Russia-based unit|date=24 May 2018|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Bellingcat published evidence that Russia had used [[Adobe Photoshop]] to manipulate satellite images of the MH17 disaster. Image forensics expert Jens Kriese of Germany maintained that Bellingcat's report used invalid methods to reach its conclusion.&lt;ref name=ders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/expert-criticizes-allegations-of-russian-mh17-manipulation-a-1037125.html |title=Expert Criticizes Allegations of Russian MH17 Manipulation |work=Der Spiegel |author=Jens Kriese |date=June 4, 2015 |accessdate=June 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a follow-up report, Bellingcat published crowdfunded satellite imagery and further analysis that supported their claim.&lt;ref name=zeitde&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/ausland/2015-06/bellingcat-russland-mh17-satellitenfotos-manipulation |title=Bellingcat kontert Kritik mit neuen Satellitenbildern |work=Zeit Online |language=German |author= |date=12 June 2015 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On December 20, 2017, Bellingcat published an article focusing on a section of the 2017 [[Intelligence and Security Committee]] report, which categorically stated that the British stance on the MH17 incident was that Russian forces were behind the orchestration and implementation of a plan to shoot down an aircraft. Whether the target was the MH17 passenger jet is not defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toler|first1=Aric|title=British Intelligence Report Confirms Russian Military Origin of MH17 Murder Weapon|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/12/20/british-intelligence-report-confirms-russian-military-origin-mh17-murder-weapon/|website=Bellingcat|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCP Annual Report 2016-2017|url=https://b1cba9b3-a-5e6631fd-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/independent.gov.uk/isc/files/2016-2017_ISC_AR.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqS8WVJqzXucCjkPcD1PkT4M4RJspBV9tHBYEJAZLobTFw2rG67hpLh55zoZsZ9_9Xrmtqiq4CzbwmhAUpzCTh3AW-lBjOdmWFYJds1-EYzBgJGRmPWubVpg_Yl0SrMUrYTcKGn-8HtPvf5AARiu60msxtT2SpjJfdv78EEeqkINZBUythVem1KHFtKbbziZLQNdiiOymaCinv1pUa1FIpSVaHOkjNwmyfFteiMvnTRX00Qz_0%3D&amp;attredirects=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syrian Civil War===
{{main|Syrian Civil War}}

[[File:ISIS (Grey) Territory Change 2014-2016.gif|thumb|ISIS (grey) territory change 2014â2016]]
Beginning in March 2011 after political protests turned violent,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-12791738l|title=Middle East unrest: Three killed at protest in Syria |publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Syrian Civil War has been an ongoing conflict between the [[Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Syrian Opposition]], [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], and [[List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War|other combatants]]. Bellingcat reports primarily analyse the factions at war, and what weapons and armor they utilize, as well as news that would normally go unreported by the mainstream media. Bellingcat utilizes a network of contributors who specialize in open source and social media investigation, and creates guides and case studies so others may learn to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.bellingcat.com/about/|title= About |last=Higgins|first=Elliot|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Bellingcat published extensive evidence of chemical weapons being used on Syrian civilians, including children. Collecting and analysing video footage from local sources which apparently showed parts of [[chlorine]] cylinders, Higgins said that while the contents of the cylinders could not be verified "the injuries depicted in the videos all appear to be consistent with chemical exposure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/syria-is-accused-of-suffocating-its-citizens-with-chlorine-bombs|title=Syria Is Accused of Suffocating Its Citizens with Chlorine Bombs|date=23 April 2014|work=Vice News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, Bellingcat published an article showing the use of [[cluster munition]]s were being used against the [[New Syrian Army]], in clear violation of the [[Convention on Cluster Munitions]]. Bellingcat provided photographic evidence from firsthand sources that the munitions used were identical to those used by the [[Russian Armed Forces|Russian Military]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/06/21/al-tanf-bombing-russia-assisted-isis-attacking-us-backed-fsa-group-cluster-bombs/|title=The al-Tanf Bombing: How Russia Assisted ISIS by Attacking an American Backed FSA Group with Cluster Bombs|last=Komar|first=Rao|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008185930/https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/06/21/al-tanf-bombing-russia-assisted-isis-attacking-us-backed-fsa-group-cluster-bombs/|archive-date=2016-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Bellingcat published an article detailing how rudimentary [[Quadcopter|drones]] were being used by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] to drop explosives onto opposition targets. Analysing footage from Twitter and other social media platforms, it was discovered that the drones were dropping modified [[40 mm grenade|40mm grenades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/uncategorized/2017/02/10/death-drone-bombs-caliphate/|title=Death From Above: The Drone Bombs of the Caliphate |last=Waters|first=Nick |website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bellingcat also does extensive reporting into attacks that are not openly claimed by combatants.

In September 2016, Bellingcat released a fact-checking article in response to Russia denying the bombing of hospitals in Syria. The article analysed footage from YouTube and images from Facebook, cross referencing them with areas that were confirmed to be attacked by Russian forces. The article reported that the hospital in question was within the area under Russian attack, although Russia denies these claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/09/01/fact-checking-russias-claim-didnt-bomb-5-year-old-syria/|title=Fact-Checking Russiaâs Claim that It Didnât Bomb a 5-Year-Old in Syria |last=Al-Khatib|first=Hady|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, Bellingcat published an investigative report on [[2017 al-Jina mosque airstrike|the bombing of a mosque in Aleppo]] that killed over 50 civilians.  The article included photographs of the remnants of the bomb used, and showed that the piece was identical to that of similar bombs used by the US military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/03/16/us-missile-remains-reportedly-recovered-from-site-of-aleppo-mosque-bombing/|title=CONFIRMED: US Responsible for âAleppo Mosque Bombingâ |last=Triebert|first=Christiaan|website=Bellingcat|access-date=2017-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemeni Civil War===

Bellingcat published that in the [[2018 Hajjah Governorate airstrike]] the bomb was made by the American company [[Raytheon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/04/27/american-made-bomb-used-airstrike-yemen-wedding/|title=American-Made Bomb Used in Airstrike on Yemen Wedding - bellingcat|date=27 April 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, a Bellingcat investigation on [[Houthi]] broadcasts through their affiliated [[Almasirah]] news channel of missile attacks targeted against [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) airports the [[Abu Dhabi International Airport]] and [[Dubai International Airport]] was published. The investigation report concluded that "It is highly likely that a Houthi-led drone attack did not take place in Abu Dhabi or Dubai".&lt;ref name="BY"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2018/11/07/investigating-houthi-claims-drone-attacks-uae-airports/|title=Investigating Houthi Claims of Drone Attacks on UAE Airports|author=Khalil Dewan|publisher=bellingcat.com|date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the claims of the attacks constituted a a propaganda effort and followed a "propaganda pattern" claims by the [[Houthi]] leaders.&lt;ref name="BY"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skripal poisoning===
{{main|Poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal}}
Following [[RT (TV network)|RT]]'s interview with the suspects of the Sergei Skripal poisoning case, Bellingcat published the suspectsâ passport data showing inconsistencies in the official story, and possible links to the Russian secret service. The Russian foreign ministry rejected the report stating that it believed Bellingcat had ties to western intelligence. It noted Bellingcat's access to a Russian database not publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/14/skripal-poisoning-suspects-passport-data-shows-link-security-services/|title=Skripal Poisoning Suspect's Passport Data Shows Link to Security Services - bellingcat|date=14 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/15/documents-show-novichok-salisbury-suspects-alexander-petrov-ruslan-boshirov-links-defence|title=Documents reveal Salisbury poisoning suspects' Russian defence ministry ties|first=Andrew|last=Roth|date=15 September 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, the website said it had identified one of the suspects as decorated [[GRU]] [[colonel]] [[Anatoliy Chepiga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/salisbury-poisoning-suspect-is-russian-colonel-reports|title=Salisbury poisoning suspect identified as Russian colonel|first1=Andrew|last1=Roth|first2=Vikram|last2=Dodd|date=26 September 2018|website=the Guardian|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2015, Eliot Higgins and Bellingcat received the special prize of the [[Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanns-joachim-friedrichs.de/index.php/pressemitteilung-2015.html |title=Pressemitteilung 2015 - Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Preis |website=Hanns-joachim-friedrichs.de |date= |accessdate=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bersih 5 rally''' (also known by its tagline: '''Combine our energy â New Malaysia''')&lt;ref name="TSD01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bersih 5 rally set for Nov 19|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1971236|publisher=The Sun Daily|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a peaceful democratic protest in Malaysia, supported by the [[Bersih|Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections]] (Bersih), which took place on 19 November 2016. The rally was held calling for a new and cleaner electoral system in [[Malaysia]]. A Bersih convoy was also launched and targeted all parts of Malaysia to raise awareness of the current democratic problems nationwide.&lt;ref name="MK01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Bersih is marching for the fifth time on Nov 19 - Malaysiakini|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/355714|publisher=Malaysia Kini|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMM01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria Chin: Bersih 5 in November|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/maria-chin-bersih-5-in-november|publisher=The Malay Mail|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TMM02"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bersih 5 on November 19|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/bersih-5-on-november-19|publisher=The Malay Mail|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TS01"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bersih 5 rally set for Nov 19|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/09/14/bersih-5-rally-set-for-nov-19/|publisher=The Star|accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Incumbent Malaysian Prime Minister [[Najib Razak]] has denied any wrongdoing amidst the ongoing [[1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal]] and former premier Mahathir Mohamad has come out in support of pro Bersih campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/1mdb-scandal-around-malaysian-prime-minister-najib-puts-spotlight-on-wife-1473606895|title=1MDB Scandal Around Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Puts Spotlight on Wife|first=Tom|last=Wright|date=12 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Shirts were basically formed to opposed the activities of Bersih, especially its criticisms of the government and to support the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/red-shirts-gather-to-counter-bersih-5-rally|title=Red Shirts gather to counter Bersih 5 rally|date=19 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many members of the Red Shirts consists of [[United Malay National Organisation|UMNO]], which is the ruling party in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/363203|title=Sâgor Umno info chief and his kids will join the red-shirts|date=17 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/2062828|title=Umno will not stop its members from joining Red Shirts group (Updated) - theSundaily|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/11/16/umno-powerless-to-stop-members-from-wearing-red-shirts/|title=Umno powerless to stop members from wearing red shirts|date=16 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro government group led by Jamal Yunos indicates that the Red Shirts will confront the yellow shirt Bersih protesters during the stipulated rally on 19 November 2016. In a prelude encounter, Jamal Yunos was injured with his nose bloodied in [[Ampang, Kuala Lumpur|Ampang]] during a filmed scuffle with the police, with Jamal shouting that he was punched by the police.&lt;ref name="TheStar131116"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jamal Yunos left with bloodied nose|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/11/13/jamal-bloodied-nose-ampang/|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later changed his statement because he was threatened by the government, claiming he was punched by a Bersih supporter.&lt;ref name="TheStar131116" /&gt;

=== Participants ===

== Pre-rally plans ==
=== Bersih convoy ===
Bersih organised a convoy of vehicles to tour parts of Peninsula Malaysia and the states of Sabah and Sarawak to disseminate information to the public about the Bersih's goals regarding institutional reforms and creating awareness about the 1MDB scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/10/182740/bersih-5-convoy-causes-barely-stir-pahang|title=Bersih 5 convoy causes barely a stir in Pahang|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout their nationwide roadshow in Peninsula Malaysia, the Bersih convoy had to endure harassment from anti-Bersih groups such as the Red Shirts and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/11/11/sarawak-bersih-convoy-peaceful-as-theres-no-umno/|title=Sarawak Bersih convoy peaceful as there's no Umno|date=11 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/11/188318/man-recorded-hurling-racist-remarks-bersih-5-convoy-under-investigation|title=Man recorded hurling racist remarks at Bersih 5 convoy under investigation|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/360116|title=Politics could be derailing Bersih convoy in Selangor|date=23 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-rally arrests ==
The Malaysian police, during their raid on Bersih's office in [[Petaling Jaya]] arrested Bersih chairperson [[Maria Chin Abdullah]] and secretariat Mandeep Singh for their part in organising the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/11/18/police-arrests-maria-chin-after-bersih-raid/|title=Police arrest Maria Chin after Bersih raid|date=18 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/11/189909/bersih-rally-go-or-without-maria-chin|title=Bersih rally to go on, with or without Maria Chin|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the Red Shirts, a group opposing Bersih and their Yellow Shirt followers, Jamal Yunos was arrested a few hours before the Bersih rally began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/11/19/cops-arrest-red-shirts-leader-jamal-yunos-from-hotel/|title=Cops arrest Red Shirts leader Jamal Yunos|date=19 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rally incidents ==
The counter-rally by the Red Shirts ended prematurely after they were unable to get past the police blockade to confront the Bersih rally-goers, with a majority of them dispersing at Padang Merbok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/11/190097/red-shirts-regrouping-padang-merbok|title=Red Shirts regrouping at Padang Merbok|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/11/19/red-shirts-disperse-leaving-padang-merbok-in-a-mess/|title=Red Shirts disperse, leaving Padang Merbok in a mess|date=19 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Even though the protests ended peacefully, the arrests against Bersih protestors such as [[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|People's Justice Party (Malaysia)'s]] [[Chua Tian Chang|Tian Chua]] and [[Zuraida Kamaruddin]] were conducted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/11/20/tian-chua-and-zuraida-arrested/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://english.astroawani.com/malaysia-news/bersih-5-tian-chua-zuraida-detained-police-123143&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
=== Prime Minister ===
Then Prime Minister Datuk Seri [[Najib Razak]] who was in Tokyo, said that Malaysians should respect the law and avoid chaos and physical clashes. He also claimed that Malaysians should elect their leaders without having to protest as it was not Malaysia's culture, despite the fact that right of peaceful assembly (which Bersih exercised) is legally provided for in Malaysia.&lt;ref name="NST171116"&gt;{{cite web|title=Avoid chaos, Najib says ahead of Bersih|url=http://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/11/189284/avoid-chaos-najib-says-ahead-bersih|website=NST Online|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysian Police ===
Inspector General of Police, Khalid Abu Bakar stated that Bersih 5 does not fulfil the Section 10(c) and Section 11 of [[Peaceful Assembly Act 2012]] as there was no consent letter was produced for the venue of the rally, Dataran Merdeka.&lt;ref name="FMT081116"&gt;{{cite web|title=IGP: Bersih 5 doesn't fulfil rules of Peaceful Assembly Act|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2016/11/08/igp-bersih-5-doesnt-fulfil-rules-of-peaceful-assembly-act/|website=Free Malaysia Today|accessdate=19 November 2016|date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-governmental organisations ===
[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] have condemned the spate of arrests by the government of Malaysian activists as a form of intimidation and harassment against dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/aec/30300361|title=Protesters gather in Malaysia's capital for anti-government rally - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mysinchew.com/node/116125?tid=4|title=Malaysiakini editor charged amidst press freedom fears|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2016/11/malaysia-end-crackdown-on-bersih-activists/|title=Malaysia: End crackdown on Bersih activists|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Ernest Drummond''' (born 29 April 1953) is a Scottish artist, musician, writer, and record producer. He was the co-founder of late 1980s avant-garde pop group [[The KLF]] and its 1990s media-manipulating successor, the [[K Foundation]], with which he [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|famously burned Â£1 million]] in 1994. More recent art activities, carried out under Drummond's chosen banner of the Penkiln Burn, include making and distributing cakes, soup, flowers, beds and shoe-shines. More recent music projects include [[No Music Day]], and the international tour of a choir called The17. Drummond is the author of several books about art and music.

==Background==
William Ernest Drummond&lt;ref&gt;Drummond's full name is given in "Special K" by William Shaw, ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; was born in [[Butterworth, South Africa|Butterworth]], South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;Confirmed by Drummond's official website ([http://www.penkiln-burn.com/jobs/job44.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A music encyclopaedia once mistakenly printed that Drummond was born ''William Butterworth'' not ''in Butterworth''. This error has been reported, and Drummond's real name confirmed, by, for example, ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'' (Edinburgh), 27 February 2000, p 22.&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] for the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Harrison |title=Bill Drummond: The Man Who Wants To End Recorded Music |url=http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/bill-drummond-man-who-wants-end-recorded-music |work=[[The Word (magazine)|The Word]] |publisher=Development Hell Limited |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912154836/http://www.wordmagazine.co.uk/content/bill-drummond-man-who-wants-end-recorded-music |archivedate=12 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved back to Scotland when he was 18 months old, and his early years were spent in the town of [[Newton Stewart]]. He moved to [[Corby]], Northamptonshire at the age of 11. It was here that he first became involved in performing as a musician, initially working with school friends such as Gary Carson and Chris Ward.&lt;ref&gt;McKerron, I., "Duo Burn Â£1M In Midnight Madness", ''Daily Express'', 1 October 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=388 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[University of Northampton]] and the [[Art and Design Academy]] from 1970 to 1973. He later decided that "art should use everything, be everywhere" and that, as an artist, he would "use whatever medium is to hand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penkilnburn.com/about/biography_very_long.php |title=About |publisher=Penkiln Burn |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two years working as a milkman, gardener, steel worker, nursing assistant, theatre carpenter, and scene painter.

==Career==

===1970s: ''Illuminatus'', Big in Japan, and Zoo===
In 1975 Drummond began working at the Everyman Theatre, Liverpool as a carpenter and scene painter. In 1976 he was the set designer for the first stage production of ''[[The Illuminatus Trilogy]]'', a 12-hour performance which opened on 23 November 1976, and which was staged by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]]'s "Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool".&lt;ref&gt;Drummond mentioned Campbell and the play in an interview by Ben Watkins, published by ''The Wire'' Magazine in March 1997 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=435]). Campbell spoke about his production in an interview given to James Nye, first published in ''Gneurosis'' 1991, available at [http://www.frogboy.freeuk.com/ken.html Frogweb: Ken Campbell] (URL accessed 2 March 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Logan, B., "Arts: Gastromancy and other animals: Ken Campbell has a new show at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] â but he'd rather tell Brian Logan about dogs that talk and sucking spirits up your bottom", ''The Guardian'' ([[Manchester]]), 29 August 2000, "Guardian Features Pages" section, p14.&lt;/ref&gt; This production then transferred to the National Theatre in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/7081/history-of-the-nt/denys-lasduns-national-theatre.html |title=Denys Lasdun's National Theatre|work= |publisher=National Theatre |quote=The National opened theatre-by-theatre, as the building became available. The Lyttelton opened first in March 1976, with a season of plays transferred from the Company's first home, the Old Vic. It was followed by the Olivier in October of that year with Tamburlaine The Great; the Cottesloe opened on 4 March 1977 with Illuminatus!, an eight-hour play by Ken Campbell. The Queen officially opened the National Theatre on 26 October 1976. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119061721/http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/7081/history-of-the-nt/denys-lasduns-national-theatre.html |archivedate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Campbell, Drummond became known as "the man who went for [[Araldite]]": "In the middle of a tour, Drummond announced he was popping out to get some glue â and never returned."&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Neil, "Yes, this is the cutting edge of rave music Forty striking dockers, one brass band, two former pop stars in wheelchairs and one baffled reporter. What's going on?", ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), The Arts p26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond's musical career began in 1977 with [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]], a band whose membership also included future luminaries [[Holly Johnson]] ([[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]), [[Budgie (drummer)|Budgie]] ([[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]), [[Jayne Casey]] ([[Pink Military]]/[[Pink Industry]]) and [[Ian Broudie]] ([[The Lightning Seeds]]).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Pattenden, M., "A Broudie guy", ''The Times'' (1FA Edition, London), 30 October 1999, p8.&lt;/ref&gt; After the band's demise, Drummond and another member [[David Balfe]] started [[Zoo Records]], their first release being Big in Japan's posthumous EP, ''[[From Y To Z and Never Again (Album)|From Y To Z and Never Again]]''. They went on to act as producers of the debut albums by [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]] and [[The Teardrop Explodes]], both of which Drummond would later manage somewhat idiosyncratically. With Zoo Music Ltd, Drummond and Balfe were also music publishers for Zodiac Mindwarp &amp; The Love Reaction and The Proclaimers. The production team of Drummond and Balfe was christened The Chameleons, who recorded the single "Touch" together with singer Lori Lartey as [[Lori and the Chameleons]].&lt;ref name="tatetat"&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''New Musical Express'', 20 November 1993, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s: A&amp;R man &amp; solo recording artist===
Drummond later took a job in the mainstream music business as an [[A&amp;R]] consultant for the label [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] working with [[Strawberry Switchblade]] and [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]]. In July 1986, on his 33 and a third birthday, Drummond repented his corporate involvement and resigned his job by way of a "ringingly quixotic press release": "I will be 33.5 (sic) years old in September, a time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and I want to see the world from the top..."&lt;ref&gt;Drummond's 1986 press release, quoted by Shaw in ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; (In an interview in December 1990, Drummond recalled spending half a million pounds at WEA on the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]]&amp;nbsp;â for whom he envisioned massive worldwide success&amp;nbsp;â only for them to completely flop. "At that point I thought 'What am I doing this for?' and I got out.")&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;Bill Drummond interviewed by [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]] on ''Saturday Sequence'', [[BBC Radio 1]], December 1990 ([http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 MP3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524180959/http://www.brandnew.co.uk/klf/billdrummond/Bill%20Drummond%20Interview_Radio1%20Dec90.mp3 |date=24 May 2006 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond was "obviously very sharp," said WEA chairman [[Rob Dickens]], "and he knew the business. But he was too radical to be happy inside a corporate structure. He was better off working as an outsider."&lt;ref name="trash"&gt;Sharkey, A., "Trash Art &amp; Kreation", ''The Guardian'', 21 May 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, Drummond issued a solo album, ''[[The Man (Bill Drummond album)|The Man]]'', a country/folk music recording, backed by Australian rock group [[The Triffids]]. The album was released on Creation Records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bill-Drummond-The-Man/release/2329417 |title=Bill Drummond â The Man (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included the sardonic "[[Julian Cope]] Is Dead", where he outlined his fantasy of shooting the Teardrop Explodes frontman in the head to ensure the band's early demise and subsequent legendary status. The song has commonly been seen as a reply to the Cope song "Bill Drummond Said".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bar-none.com/bios/drumbio.html |title=Bill Drummond |publisher=Bar-none.com |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206211828/http://www.bar-none.com/bios/drumbio.html |archivedate=6 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Graham Johnston |url=http://www.beefheart.com/zine/001/45rm.htm |title=Clicks and Klangs â Bill Drummond â 45 |publisher=Beefheart.com |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207155057/http://www.beefheart.com/zine/001/45rm.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a B-side, Drummond wrote and recorded "The Manager" in which he lamented the state of the music industry and offered his services to help fix it.

''The Man'' received positive reviews â including 4 stars from ''[[Q Magazine]]'';&lt;ref&gt;du Noyer, P. (1986), "''The Man''" review, ''[[Q Magazine]]'', December (?) 1986 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=483 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; and 5 from ''Sounds'' Magazine who called the album a "touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement".&lt;ref name="sounds-man"&gt;Wilkinson, R., "''The Man'' review", ''Sounds'', 8 November 1986 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=15 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond intended to focus on writing books once ''The Man'' had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, "That only lasted three months, until I had an[other] idea for a record and got dragged back into it all".&lt;ref name="skinner"/&gt;

===1987â1992: The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu, The Timelords and The KLF===
{{Main|The KLF}}
While out walking on [[New Years Day]] 1987, Drummond formulated a plan to make a hip-hop record. However, "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said. "...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, I thought, I knew [[Jimmy Cauty|Jimmy [Cauty]]], I knew he was a like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said 'Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu'. And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'".&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story Of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First [[BBC]] broadcast believed to have been in  late 1994, and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[Citadel Media|ABC]] on [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm 1 January 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010218093054/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm |date=18 February 2001 }}.

Drummond and Cauty (who Drummond had signed to [[Food Records|Food]]/[[Warner Music Group|WEA]] as a member of Brilliant) released their first single, [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]]'s "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]", in March 1987. This was followed by an album â ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)]]'' â in June of the same year, and a high-profile copyright dispute with [[ABBA]] and the [[Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society]].&lt;ref name=sweden87&gt;"Thank You For The Music", ''New Musical Express'', 17 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; A second album  â ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]'', also the last album under the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (The JAMs) name, was released in February 1988.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Later in 1988, Drummond and Cauty released a 'novelty' pop single, "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]" as The Timelords. The song reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 12 June, and charted highly in Australia and New Zealand. On the back of this success, the duo self-published a book, ''[[The Manual|The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)]]''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In late 1988, the duo was renamed [[The KLF]] and released their first singles under this moniker, "[[Burn the Bastards]]" and "[[Burn the Beat]]" (both taken from the JAMs' last album). (From late 1987, Drummond and Cauty's independent record label had been named "[[KLF Communications]]".) As The KLF, Drummond and Cauty would amass fame and fortune. "[[What Time Is Love?]]" â a signature song which they would revisit and revitalise several times in the coming years â saw its first release in July 1988, and its success spawned an album, ''[[The "What Time Is Love?" Story]]'', in September 1989.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

''[[Chill Out]]'', an [[ambient house]] album which had its roots in Cauty's chill-out sessions with [[The Orb]]'s [[Alex Paterson]], was released in February 1990. Described by ''[[The Times]]'' as "The KLF's comedown classic",&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Paddy, "And you thought they were dead", ''The Times'' (London) ISSN 0140-0460 , 4 May 2001, Features p2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chill Out'' was named the fifth best dance album of all time in a 1996 ''[[Mixmag]]'' feature.&lt;ref&gt;Philips, D., "50 Greatest Dance Albums: # 5", ''[[Mixmag]]'', March 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=478 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The KLF's commercial success peaked in 1991, with ''[[The White Room]]'' album and the accompanying "Stadium House" singles, remixes of 1988's "What Time Is Love?", 1989's "[[3&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eternal]]", 1990's "[[Last Train to Trancentral]]"; and "[[Justified and Ancient]]", a new song based on a sample from ''1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)''{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 1992, The KLF were awarded the "Best British group" [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Award]]. With grindcore group [[Extreme Noise Terror]], The KLF performed a live "violently antagonistic performance" of "[[3&amp;nbsp;a.m. Eternal]]" at the BRIT Awards ceremony in front of "a stunned music-business audience".&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, N., "The Arts: My name is Bill, and I'm a popaholic", ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 2 March 2000, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in the evening Drummond and Cauty dumped a dead sheep with the message "I died for you âbon appetit {{sic}}" tied around its waist at the entrance to one of the post-ceremony parties.&lt;ref name="sheep-seats"&gt;Kelly, D. "Welcome To The Sheep Seats", ''New Musical Express'', 29 February 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=297 link])&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[NME]]'' listed this appearance at number 4 in their "top 100 rock moments",&lt;ref&gt;[http://microsites.nme.com/rock100/site/4.html "100 Rock Moments"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417214917/http://microsites.nme.com/rock100/site/4.html |date=17 April 2006 }}, NME.com. Retrieved 21 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2003, ''The Observer'' named it the fifth greatest "publicity stunt" in the history of popular music.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, B.

On 14 May 1992, The KLF announced their immediate retirement from the music industry and the [[Deletion (music industry)|deletion]] of their ''entire'' back catalogue, an act which associate [[Scott Piering]] described as "[throwing] away a fortune".&lt;ref name="select92"&gt;"Who Killed The KLF?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', July 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; 

As when he left WEA, Drummond issued an enigmatic press release, this time talking of a "wild and wounded, glum and glorious, shit but shining path" he and Cauty had been following "...these past five years. The last two of which has {{sic}} led us up onto the commercial high groundâwe are at a point where the path is about to take a sharp turn from these sunny uplands down into a netherworld of we know not what."&lt;ref&gt;KLF Communications advertisement in ''New Musical Express'', 16 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Timelords gentlemen, please!", ''New Musical Express'', 16 May 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309 link])&lt;/ref&gt; There have been numerous suggestions that in 1992 Drummond was at the edge of a nervous breakdown.&lt;ref name="select92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vox (magazine)|''Vox'' Magazine]] wrote, for example, that 1992 was "the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when The KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, ... [and] machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, G., "The Chronicled Mutineers", ''Vox'', December 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=430 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond himself said that he was on the edge of the "abyss".&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Bill and Mark Manning, ''Bad Wisdom'' ({{ISBN|0-14-026118-4}})&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993â1997: K Foundation, burning one million pounds, and other activities with Jimmy Cauty===

Despite The KLF's retirement from the music business, Drummond's involvement with Jimmy Cauty was far from over. In 1993, the pair regrouped as the [[K Foundation]], ostensibly a foundation for the arts. They established the [[K Foundation art award]] for the "''worst'' artist of the year". The award, worth Â£40,000, was presented to [[Rachel Whiteread]] on 23 November 1993 outside London's [[Tate Gallery]]. Ms Whiteread had just accepted the Â£20,000 1993 [[Turner Prize]] award for best British [[Contemporary art]]ist inside the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Ellison, M. "Terror strikes at the Turner Prize / Art at its very best (or worst)", ''The Guardian'', 24 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=362 link]).&lt;/ref&gt; The K Foundation award attracted huge interest from the British [[broadsheets|broadsheet newspapers]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[K Foundation art award#Media and art-world reaction]] for some of the reports.&lt;/ref&gt;

Infamy followed when, on 23 August 1994, the K Foundation burnt what remained of The KLF's earnings â one million [[pounds sterling]] â at a [[boathouse]] on the [[Scottish island]] of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].&lt;ref name="burning"&gt;"Burning Question", ''The Observer'', 13 February 2000 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=486 link])&lt;/ref&gt; A film of the event â ''[[Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]]'' â was taken on tour, with Drummond and Cauty discussing the incineration with members of the public after each screening. In 2004 Drummond admitted to the BBC that he now regretted burning the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McKevitt |first=Greg |title=What Drummond did next |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=30 April 2004 |accessdate=18 August 2013 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/3667901.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain why I did it so people would understand."&lt;ref&gt;"KLF Bill: I regret burning Â£1m", ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' ([[Glasgow]]), 25 July 2004, p27.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 September 1995 the duo recorded "[[The Magnificent (song)|The Magnificent]]" for ''[[The Help Album]]''. In 1997, Drummond and Cauty briefly re-emerged as 2K and K2 Plant Hire Ltd. with various plans to "[[Fuck the Millennium]]". K2 Plant Hire's published aim was to "build a massive pyramid containing one brick for every person born in the UK during the 20th century"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fortean Times]]'', referencing ''[[The Big Issue]]'', 15â21 Sept and ''The Guardian'', 5 Nov 1997. ([http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/107_sdays.shtml link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504220313/http://www.forteantimes.com/articles/107_sdays.shtml |date=4 May 2006 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the public were urged to donate bricks, with 1.5 bricks per Briton being needed to complete the project.&lt;ref&gt;"2K: Brickin' it!", ''New Musical Express'', Nov 97 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=457 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond also contributed a short story titled "Letâs Grind, or How K2 Plant Hire Ltd Went to Work" to the book "Disco 2000".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Champion (journalist)|Champion, S.]] (editor), ''Disco 2000'', Sceptre, {{ISBN|0-340-70771-2}}, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art activities and the Penkiln Burn ===
Drummond studied painting at Liverpool School of Art from 1972 to 1973. Following that, he decided that instead of limiting his practice to paint and canvas, as an artist he would use any medium that came to hand. He has said that much of his work since  â including the pop-music, book-writing, and The17 choir â has been done as art.&lt;ref&gt;See interview [[Apollo Magazine]], Belgium March 2010. Or questions 77 to 80, Q&amp;A [http://www.penkilnburn.com penkilnburn.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1998, Drummond's art activities have been carried out using the brand-name of the Penkiln Burn. This is the name of the river in Scotland upon the banks of which he played and fished as a boy.

In 1995, Drummond bought ''A Smell of Sulphur in the Wind'' by [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], for $20,000. In Drummondâs own words, he âfell in love with Richard Longâs work becauseâ "it was art by walking and doing things on his walks."&lt;ref&gt;page ii How To Be An Artist 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Drummond felt that he was no longer "getting his money's worth" from the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;see page 27 $20,000 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  He decided to try to sell it by placing a series of placards around the country. When this failed to result in its sale, in 2001 he cut the photograph and mounting card into 20,000 pieces to sell for $1 each. His plan, upon retrieving the $20,000 in cash, is to walk with it to the remote place in Iceland where Richard Long had made the photograph and bury it in a box beneath the stone circle. He will then take his own photograph of the site, bring it home, frame it, hang it in the same place in his bedroom where the Richard Long hung, and call the new work ''The Smell of Money Underground''. Drummond's books ''How to be an Artist'' and a later soft-bound edition titled ''$20,000'' recounts this story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q-arts.co.uk/parsetemplate.asp?id=109 Q ARTS | How to be an Artist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050511125444/http://www.q-arts.co.uk/parsetemplate.asp?id=109 |date=11 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Bill, ''Job 5'', [http://www.penkiln-burn.com/jobs/job5elements.html Penkiln Burn]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Drummond was involved in a controversial exhibition at the deconsecrated [[St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Liverpool]]. Drummond contributed a guestbook which asked visitors "Is God a Cunt?".&lt;ref&gt;"Artistic or offensive?", ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'', 20 September 2002, p1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that the artwork had been stolen and a Â£1000 reward offered for its return.&lt;ref&gt;"Art stolen from church", ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'', 1 October 2002, 1st edition p9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Self|Self, W.]], "God is in the details", ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) ISSN 0951-9467 , 14 October 2002, Features p14.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond himself said that he would answer "no" to his own question: "God is responsible for all the things I love, the speckles on a [[brown trout]]; the sound of [[Angus Young]]'s guitar, the nape of my girlfriend's neck, the song of the [[blackcap]] when he returns in Spring. I never blame God for all the shit, for the baby [[Rwanda]]n slaughtered in a casual [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]], the ever-present wars, drudgery and misery that fills most of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;"Artwork that uses [[obscene language]] is stolen from Merseyside church", ''[[The Independent]]'' (London) ISSN 0951-9467 , 1 October 2002, News p5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Penkiln Burn projects involve making things and then distributing them. Drummond has created a Soup Line drawn across a map going through Belfast and Nottingham to the edges of the British Isles. Anyone living on the Soup Line may contact Drummond to come to their house and make soup for them, their family and friends. Drummond has also constructed â and encourages others to construct â Cake Circles drawn on maps. Cakes are then made and delivered to people who live within the circle with the words "I have baked you a cake, here it is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penkilnburn.com/poster.php?poster=73.jpg&amp;painting=09 |title=Penkiln Burn |publisher=Penkiln Burn |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other projects involve Drummond building beds from timber in public places which are then raffled off. In 2011, for the Venice Biennale, Drummond took up shoe-shining on the streets of Venice. Each spring, Drummond gives away 40 bunches of daffodils to strangers on the street in different cities.&lt;ref&gt;Penkiln Burn jobs are detailed at www.penkilnburn.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond's web-based projects include MyDeath.net, where people can plan their own funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Mick, "Bill Drummond once burnt Pounds 1m for art's sake. Now he is taking a soupopera to Belfast", ''[[Sunday Times]]'' (London), 18 April 2004, p18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--, and...--&gt;  Another site, youwhores.com, was meant for anyone to advertise any kind of service at their own set price. Due to misuse though, youwhores.com has become archival only. Still open for contributions is Drummond's website www.openmanifesto.com which "exists to define what art is and art is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openmanifesto.com/notice.php?lang=english |title=The Open Manifesto |publisher=The Open Manifesto |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open Manifesto site invites definitions of art in 100 words or less.

Drummond was a Director of The Foundry, an arts centre in [[Shoreditch]], London which closed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundry.tv/ |title=The Foundry |publisher=Foundry.tv |date= |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also owner of The Curfew Tower in [[Cushendall]], Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="BelfastNews"&gt;"Perfect tower for artistic retreat", Arts Diary, ''[[The Belfast News Letter]]'', 26 April 1999, p27&lt;/ref&gt; Via an arts trust called In You We Trust, the Curfew Tower acts as an artists' residency.&lt;ref name="BelfastNews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drummond, Bill, ''Welcome To The Turnly Prize'', [http://www.penkiln-burn.com/jobs/job43_elements/30.html Penkiln Burn], June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 onwards: Music===
&lt;!--Kalevala needs a mention.--&gt;

With Jimmy Cauty, Bill Drummond announced his retirement from pop-music with a dramatic performance involving deactivated machine guns, a dead sheep and a grindcore version of the KLF hit 3am Eternal at the [[Brit Awards#The KLF (1992)|1992 BRIT Awards]]. His involvement in the music industry more widely has been minimal since his final collaboration with Jimmy Cauty as 2K in 1997.

In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond to write and record a theme song for the Scotland national football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"KLF kick off their bid for France 98", ''The Sun'' (London), 30 January 1998, p29.&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but he wondered if he had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen ("Vindaloo") and Ian Broudie ("Three Lions"), two men he had met on the same day when working on ''Illuminatus!'' in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.

In 2000, Drummond released ''[[45 (book)|45]]'', a book consisting of a "series of loosely related [[vignette (literature)|vignettes]] forming the rambling diary of one year."&lt;ref&gt;Maunsell, J.B., ''The Times'' (London), 26 February 2000, p22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''45'' also explored Drummond's KLF legacy, and was well received by the press.&lt;ref&gt;For reviews see [[45 (book)#Reviews]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====No Music Day====
{{Main|No Music Day}}
In 2005, Drummond announced an annual No Music Day on 21 November. The 22 November is Saint Cecilia day â the Patron Saint of Music â so No Music Day represents a fast before the feast.&lt;ref&gt;16 November 2009, Financial Times, A Day for Savouring the Sound of Silence&lt;/ref&gt;  No Music Day was held between 2005 and 2010. In this time, [[BBC Radio Scotland]] observed it by broadcasting no music, including jingles, for 24 hours. Radio Resonance FM also acknowledged it. In 2009 the entire city of Linz, Austria observed No Music Day with the backing of the city mayor; music was not played on local radio stations or in shops, and the cinemas only showed films without music soundtracks. No Music Day is documented at www.nomusicday.com

==== The17 ====
Drummond's most recent music project is a [[choir]] called [[The17]]. His first formal performance of The17 was staged with 16 other men in a studio in Leicester in 2004. It followed thoughts about music that Drummond had been having for many years. With the advent of recorded music via the internet, iPods and MP3 players etc. Drummond proclaims that "all recorded music has run its course."&lt;ref&gt;Penkiln Burn Poster 59&lt;/ref&gt;  The17 creates music that follows no musical history, or necessarily has words, melodies or rhythms. It may be made up of many human voices or none. Performances may only be recorded and played back once and then deleted. The17 can be made up of as many people who want to be a part of it at the time of a performance; they are all then lifetime members.

The17 now has several thousand members who have carried out performances on Drummond's Coast-to-Coast tour across the UK, and a World Tour which has included Jerusalem, Beijing, Port-au-Prince and Gothenburg. The17 is the subject of the 2008 book ''17'' published by Beautiful Books.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3558135/Review-17-by-Bill-Drummond.html |title=Review: 17 by Bill Drummond â Telegraph |publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performances, scores, tours and Drummond's related graffiti are documented on a website: the17.org.

A performance of The17's SURROUND, originally planned to take place in Damascus, Syria, will take place in London on 18 March 2012. Drummond explains in his essay for Treuchet Magazine: 'it would best for all concerned if the Syrian leg of the tri-nation festival was postponed for a few weeks or maybe months, when things would have undoubtedly settled down'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/bill_drummond_presents_surround_damascus_in_london/ Bill Drummond Presents: SURROUND: Damascus in London, Trebuchet-Magazine] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317081231/http://www.trebuchet-magazine.com/index.php/site/article/bill_drummond_presents_surround_damascus_in_london/ |date=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April 2013, the day before his 60th birthday, Drummond took part in what has been billed as the last performance of The17. A seventeen-hour version of Score 1: IMAGINE was performed while standing on a manhole cover at the bottom of Mathew Street in Liverpool.

=== The 25 Paintings World Tour: 2014â2025 ===
In February 2014, Drummond announced plans for a world tour, beginning under Spaghetti Junction in Birmingham on 13 March 2014 and ending at the same place on the 28 April 2025. Taking in twelve cities in twelve different countries, each leg of the tour will last three months, during which he will produce 25 Paintings whilst working on other art projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Beaumont-Thomas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/feb/14/bill-drummond-world-tour-2025 |title=Bill Drummond announces world tour that will last until 2025 &amp;#124; Culture |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews, accolades and criticism==
In 1993, ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' magazine published a list of the 100 Coolest People in Pop. Drummond was number one on the list. "What has this giant of coolness not achieved?", they asked: "Like the Monolith in [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]], Drummond has always been a step ahead of human evolution, guiding us on. Manager of The Teardrop Explodes, co-inventor of ambient and trance house, number one pop star, situationist pagan, folk troubadour, pan-dimensional zenarchist gentleman of leisure...and then, ladies and gentlemen, he THROWS IT ALL AWAY, machine-guns the audience and dumps a dead sheep on the doorstep of the Brit Awards and vanishes to build dry-stone walls. His new 'band' The K Foundation make records but say they won't release them at all until world peace is established. Deranged, inspired, intensely cool."&lt;ref&gt;"Cool like what?", ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'', September 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=343 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1993, an ''NME'' piece about the [[K Foundation]] found much to praise in Drummond's career, from [[Zoo Records]] through to the [[K Foundation art award]]: "Bill Drummond's career is like no other... there's been cynicism... and there's been care (no one who didn't love pop music could have made a record so commercial and so [[Pet Shop Boys]]-lovely as '[[Kylie Said to Jason]]', or the madly wonderful '[[Last Train to Trancentral]]', or the [[Tammy Wynette]] version of '[[Justified and Ancient]]'). There's been mysticism... But most of all there's been a belief that, both in music and life, there's something more."&lt;ref name="tatetat"/&gt;

[[Charles Shaar Murray]] wrote in ''[[The Independent]]'' that "[Bill] Drummond is many things, and one of those things is a magician. Many of his schemes... involve symbolically-weighted acts conducted away from the public gaze and documented only by Drummond himself and his participating comrades. Nevertheless, they are intended to have an effect on a worldful of people unaware that the act in question has taken place. That is magical thinking. Art is magic, and so is pop.

'''Comparative research''' is a research methodology in the [[social science]]s that aims to make comparisons across different [[country|countries]] or [[culture]]s. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of [[poverty]]).

== Development of the tradition ==

As Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of ''episteme'' and ''philo-sophia'', as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. ''Episteme'', as a form and activity in the field of ''logos'', marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures â which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) âOn comparative inquiry: the Ancient Greek originsâ. Research paper presented at the conference of the Comparative Education Society in Europe (CESE), Freiburg, Germany, 11/06/14 - 14/06/14. &lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic ''polis''. Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotusâ ''Histories'' demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. ''isegoria'' and ''parrhesia''), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

According also to [[Karl Deutsch]], we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"&gt;Deutsch 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.

Textbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Clasen"&gt;Clasen 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antal, Dierkes &amp; Weiler 1987: 13&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. [[Globalization]] has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. [[Information technology]] has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.&lt;ref&gt;Ãyen 2004: 276&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparative research defined ==
Comparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"&gt;Heidenheimer, Heclo &amp; Adams 1983: 505&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a "seamless whole."&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esping"&gt;Esping-Andersen 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clasen"/&gt; The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1990: 14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

In line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate "grand theories," such as [[Marxism]]. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related.&lt;ref&gt;Przeworski &amp; Teune 1970: 31&lt;/ref&gt; The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of [[decommodification]]. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy.&lt;ref name="Esping"/&gt; Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.

Comparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"/&gt; Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.

The [[historical comparative research]] involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

When it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.

'''Cultural conflict''' is a type of [[conflict (process)|conflict]] that occurs when different [[culture|cultural]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[belief]]s clash. It has been used to explain violence and crime.

==Wider definition==
[[Jonathan H. Turner]] defines it as a conflict caused by "differences in [[culture|cultural]] [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s and [[belief]]s that place people at odds with one another".&lt;ref name="Turner2005-87"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. Turner|authorlink=Jonathan H. Turner|title=Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90vMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113496-6|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a micro level, Alexander Grewe discusses a cultural conflict between guests of different culture and nationality as seen in a British 1970 sitcom, ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.&lt;ref name="Grewe2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Grewe|title="I'm sick to death with you..." or External Character Conflicts in Fawlty Towers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRnUcigKzqEC&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=17 October 2005|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-638-42885-9|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines this conflict as one that occurs when '''people's''' expectations of a certain behavior coming from their cultural backgrounds are not met, as others have different cultural backgrounds and different expectations.&lt;ref name="Grewe2005"/&gt;

Cultural conflicts are difficult to resolve as parties to the conflict have different beliefs.&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"/&gt;  Cultural conflicts intensify when those differences become reflected in [[politics]], particularly on a macro level.&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan H. Turner|authorlink=Jonathan H. Turner|title=Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90vMAAAACAAJ|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 September 2005|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-13-113496-6|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of cultural conflict is [[Abortion debate|the debate]] over [[abortion]].&lt;ref name="Turner2005-83"/&gt; [[Ethnic cleansing]] is another extreme example of cultural conflict.&lt;ref name="AndersenTaylor2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Margaret L. Andersen|author2=Howard F. Taylor|title=Sociology: The Essentials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NTvpA0P3u-gC&amp;pg=PT72|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=1 January 2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-83156-1|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wars can also be a result of a cultural conflict; for example the differing views on [[slavery]] were one of the reasons for the [[American civil war]].&lt;ref name="Fellman1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Fellman|title=Inside War: The Guerrilla Conflict in Missouri During the American Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LldHnF7CB3kC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=19 April 1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506471-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrow definition==
A more narrow definition of a cultural conflict dates to [[Daniel Bell]]'s 1962 essay, "Crime as an American Way of Life", and focuses on [[criminal]]-enabling consequences of a clash in cultural values.&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Kornblum|title=Sociology in a Changing World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtKcG6qoY5AC&amp;pg=PT191|accessdate=14 January 2013|date=31 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-30157-6|pages=191â192; 195, 197, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Kornblum]] defines it as a conflict that occurs when conflicting [[Norm (social)|norm]]s create "opportunities for deviance and criminal gain in deviant [[sub-culture]]s".&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt; Kornblum notes that whenever laws impose cultural values on a group that does not share those views (often, this is the case of the majority imposing their laws on a minority), illegal markets supplied by criminals are created to circumvent those laws.&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt; He discusses the example of [[prohibition]] in the [[interbellum]] United States, and notes how the cultural conflict between pro- and anti-alcohol groups created opportunities for illegal activity; another similar example he lists is that of the [[war on drugs]].&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt;

Kornblum also classifies the cultural conflict as one of the major types of [[conflict theory]].&lt;ref name="Kornblum2011-191"/&gt;  In ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]'' [[Samuel P.

The term '''cycle of violence''' refers to repeated and dangerous acts of [[violence]]  as a cyclical pattern,&lt;ref name=HELP&gt;[http://helpguide.org/mental/domestic_violence_abuse_types_signs_causes_effects.htm#cycle ''The cycle of violence.''] Domestic Violence and Abuse,

It often refers to violent behavior learned as a child, and then repeated as an adult, therefore continuing on in a perceived cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, A. A. (2005). The Relationship Between Adolescent Physical Abuse and Criminal Offending: Support for an Enduring and Generalized Cycle of Violence. ''Journal of Family Violence.'' 20(5):279-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within a relationship==

A cycle of abuse generally follows the following pattern:&lt;ref name=HELP/&gt; 
* [[Abuse]] &amp;ndash; The abuser initiates aggressive, [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse]], designed to [[Abusive power and control|control]] and oppress the victim.
* [[Guilt (emotion)|Guilt]] &amp;ndash; The abuser feels guilty for inflicting abusive behavior, primarily out of a concern of being found guilty of abuse rather than feelings of sympathy for the victim.
* [[Rationalization (making excuses)|Excuses &amp;ndash; Rationalization]] of the behavior, including [[blame]] and excuses.
* "Normal" behavior &amp;ndash; The abuser regains personal control, creates a peaceful phase in an attempt to make the victim feel in the relationship.
* [[Fantasy (psychology)|Fantasy]] and planning &amp;ndash; thinking of what the victim has done wrong, how they will be punished, and developing a plan to realize the fantasy.
* Set-up &amp;ndash; the plan is "put in motion."

A cyclical nature of domestic violence is most prevalent in intimate terrorism (IT), which involve a pattern of ongoing [[Abusive power and control|control]] using emotional, physical and other forms of domestic violence and is what generally leads victims, who are most often women, to [[women's shelter]]s.  It is what was traditionally the definition of domestic violence and is generally illustrated with the "Power and Control Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf ''Power and Control Wheel,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027084459/http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf |date=2011-10-27 }} National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence.

Children exposed to domestic violence are likely to develop [[Behaviorism|behavioral]] problems, such as [[Regression (psychology)|regressing]], exhibiting out of control behavior,&lt;ref name=acadv&gt;[http://www.acadv.org/children.html ''The Effects of Domestic Violence on Children.''] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021103134717/http://www.acadv.org/children.html |date=2002-11-03 }} Alabama Coalition Against Domestic Violence.&lt;/ref&gt;  and imitating behaviors.

An estimated 1/5 to 1/3 of teenagers subject to viewing domestic violence situations experience [[teen dating violence]], regularly abusing or being abused by their partners verbally, mentally, emotionally, sexually and/or physically. Thirty to 50% of dating relationships can exhibit the same cycle of escalating violence in their marital relationships.&lt;ref name=SASS&gt;[http://www.sassnh.org/ ''Sexual Assault Survivor Services''] (SASS) Facts about domestic violence. (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Physical punishment]] of children has also been linked to later [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gershoff, E.T. |date=2008 |title=Report on Physical Punishment in the United States: What Research Tells Us About Its Effects on Children |format=PDF |location=Columbus, OH |publisher=Center for Effective Discipline |page=16 |url=http://www.phoenixchildrens.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/principles_and_practices-of_effective_discipline.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family violence researcher [[Murray A. Straus]] believes that disciplinary [[spanking]] forms "the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later assaults on spouses.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (2000).

==In politics==

Arab philosopher [[Ibn Khaldun]] in 1377 identified a cycle of violence in which successive [[dynasties]] take control of a state and establish [[asabiyyah]] or social cohesion, enabling them to expand to the limit. Excess 'pomp' causes the dynasty then to stagnate, become sedentary and collapse, giving way to conquest by a new, more ruthless dynasty. This cycle plays out over the course of three generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[The Muqadimmah]]'', Routledge, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John J. Mearsheimer]] the cycle of violence between nations will continue indefinitely because the [[Great powers]] fear each other, thus compete for power and dominance, in the belief that this will ensure safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[John J. Mearsheimer]], ''[[The Tragedy of Great Power Politics]]'', WW Norton, 2003, Preface&lt;/ref&gt;

'Cycle of violence' is also used more generally to describe any long-term factional dispute within a nation in which [[tit-for-tat]] acts of aggression occur frequently, as for example in  [[Argentina]] in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ervin Staub]],
''The Roots of Evil'', Cambridge UP, 1989, p281&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie Miller, ''From Lebanon to Intifada'', University Press of America, 1991, p104&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17025">The '''EVR model''' is a [[life cycle assessment]] based method to analyse consumption patterns, business strategies and design options in terms of eco-efficient value creation. Next to this it is used to compare products and service systems (e.g. [[benchmarking]]).

The '''eco-costs/value ratio''' ('''EVR''') is an indicator to reveal sustainable and un[[sustainable consumption]] patterns of people. The [[eco-costs]] is an indicator for the environmental pollution of the products people buy, the value is the price they pay for it in our free market economy. Example: When somebody spends 1000 euro per month on housing (in Europe: EVR approx. 0,3) it is less harmful for the environment than when 1000 euro is spend on diesel (in Europe: EVR approx. 1,0). See section 3.1.

The EVR is also relevant for business strategies, because companies are facing the slow but inevitable internalization of environmental costs. At the moment the costs of products don't take into account the environmental damage caused by these products. This "pollution is for free" mentality is less and less accepted by communities.

The EVR makes companies aware of the relative importance of the environmental pollution of their products, and the relative risk they run that future production costs will increase because of this internalization of environmental costs. 
By using the EVR, companies can make decisions for their product portfolio: abandon products with low value and high environmental costs and stimulate products with high value and low environmental costs. See sections 2.3 and 3.2.

[[File:EVR Value costs ecocosts chain.gif|600px|right|thumb|Figure 1: The basic idea of combining the economic and ecological chain: 'the EVR chain'.]]

==Background information==
The EVR model has been introduced in 1998 and published in 2000â2004 in the International Journal of LCA,&lt;ref&gt;VogtlÃ¤nder J.: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m464712867ph38k0/fulltext.pdf "The virtual eco-costs '99 A single LCA-based indicator for sustainability and the eco-costs-value ratio (EVR) model for economic allocation"], International Journal of LCA, 2001, 6 (3) pp 157-166&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Journal of Cleaner Production.&lt;ref&gt;VogtlÃ¤nder J.: [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=MImg&amp;_imagekey=B6VFX-44CVVBS-8-11&amp;_cdi=6022&amp;_user=499885&amp;_orig=search&amp;_coverDate=02%2F28%2F2002&amp;_sk=999899998&amp;view=c&amp;wchp=dGLbVlz-zSkzV&amp;md5=9fcd2ef852be07c9b7de3b4fb3b9b3eb&amp;ie=/sdarticle.pdf " Communicating the eco-efficiency of products and services by means of the eco-costs/value model"], Journal of Cleaner Production 10, 2002, pp 57-67&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of EVR is based on [[eco-costs]]. In 2007, 2012 and in 2017, the eco-costs system was updated. General databases of eco-costs are provided (open source) at [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com] of Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands). In 2010 a book named "LCA-based assessment of sustainability: the Eco-costs/Value Ratio (EVR)"&lt;ref&gt;J.G. VogtlÃ¤nder;[http://www.vssd.nl/hlf/b004.htm ''LCA-based assessment of sustainability: the Eco-costs/Value Ratio (EVR)''], VSSD, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was published containing the most important articles about the EVR.

==Working principle==

===The model===
EVR = Eco-costs/value. The basic idea of the EVR model is to link the '[[value chain]]'&lt;ref&gt;Porter, M. E.: Competitive advantage, Free Press, New York 1985&lt;/ref&gt;  to the ecological product chain. In the value chain, the added value (in terms of money) and the added costs are determined for each step of the product 'from cradle to grave'. Similarly, the ecological impact of each step in the product chain is expressed in terms of money, the so-called '[[eco-costs]]'.&lt;ref&gt;VogtlÃ¤nder J.G. [http://www.ecocostsvalue.com www.ecocostsvalue.com] Website. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; See Figure 1. Note that there exists also a Porter chain from the right to the left in Figure 1, starting with waste and adding value by recycling. In this way the Porter chain becomes circular.

===Eco-costs===
[[Eco-costs]] express the amount of environmental burden of a product on basis of prevention of that burden. They are the marginal prevention costs (money) which should be made to reduce the environmental pollution and materials depletion in our world to a level which is in line with the carrying capacity of our earth.

As such, the eco-costs are virtual costs, since they are not yet integrated in the real life costs of current production chains (Life Cycle Costs). The eco-costs should be regarded as hidden obligations.
 
For example: for each 1000&amp;nbsp;kg {{CO2}} emission, one should invest â¬135,- in offshore windmill parks (or other {{CO2}} reduction systems at that price or less). When this is done consequently, the total {{CO2}} emissions in the world will be reduced by 65% compared to the emissions in 2008. As a result global warming will stabilise. In short: "the eco-costs of 1000kg {{CO2}} are â¬ 135,-".
Similar calculations can be made on the environmental burden of acidification, eutrification, summer smog, fine dust, eco-toxicity, and the use of metals, fossil fuels and land (nature).

Eco-costs are used in Life Cycle Assessment, [[Life Cycle Assessment|LCA]], to assess the environmental performance of different materials, processes and End of Life methods.

===Of products===
[[File:EVR Eco-costs costs value bars.gif|350px|right|thumb|Figure 2: The decomposition of 'virtual eco-costs', costs and value of a product.]]

The EVR combines eco-cost and value to see whether a product will be successful. The product should have low environmental impact in its lifecycle (low eco-costs) and an attractive value for consumers.  The value here is the market value (perceived customer value, also called fair price).  Figure 2 depicts the three dimensions of a product: the value, the costs and the eco-costs.

It is a trend in society that heavy pollution of industry is not accepted anymore by the inhabitants of a country. This results in stricter regulations by countries (e.g. tradable emission rights, enforcement of best available technologies, eco-taxes, etc.). Eco-costs will then become part of the internal production costs. This internalizing of eco-costs might be a threat to a company, but it might also be an opportunity: âWhen my product has less eco-burden than that of my competitor, my product can withstand stricter regulations of the government. So this characteristic of low eco-costs of my product is a competitive edge.â 
To analyse the short term and the long term market prospects of a product or a product service combination (Product Service System, PSS), each product or PPS can be positioned in the portfolio matrix of Figure 3. The basic idea of the product portfolio matrix is the notion that a product, service or PSS is characterized by: 
* its short term market potential: high value/costs ratio
* its long term market requirement: low eco-costs.

[[File:product portfolio EVR.png|350px|left|thumb|Figure 3: Product portfolio matrix for EVR product strategy of companies.]]In terms of product strategy, the matrix results in 3 strategic directions:

# enhance the value/costs ratio of a green design to create a bigger market
# lower the eco-costs of current successful products to make it fit for future markets
# abandon products with a low value/ costs ratio (not much profit, small market) and high eco-costs

For many 'green designs', the usual problem is that they have a low current value/costs ratio. In most of the cases the production costs are higher than the production costs of the classic solution, in some cases even the (perceived) quality is poor. There are two ways to do something about it:

a. enhance the (perceived) quality of the product

b. attach to the product a service (create a PSS) in a way that the value of the bundle of the product and the service is more than the value of its components.

For a product which has a good present value/costs ratio, but high eco-costs, the product and the production process have to be redesigned to lower the eco-costs. This road towards [[sustainability]] is often far more promising than the strategy of enhancing the value/costs ratio of a green design. [[File:Figure 4 product strategy matrix.jpg|330px|right|thumb|Figure 4: Design strategies to enhance the EVR of a product.]]The reason is that the economies of scale for production and distribution are available and that the new product is marketed to an existing client base which is used to the brand name, the quality standards, the service system, etc.

Note: The most common fear of business managers is that their new green products end up with a deteriorated value/costs ratio, and hence will have a cumbersome position in the market. The stability of the governmental policy plays an important role here. When governmental regulations which level the playing field are postponed or even abandoned, proactive companies with sound product strategies are harmed. This can cause severe damage to the transition process and may lead to reluctance of players to move proactively in the future.
 
The most successful design options are depicted in Figure 4. The best design strategy is: 
* to increase value where value is high
* to decrease the eco-costs where the eco-costs are high

===De-linking===
[[File:Consumers spending NL.JPG|340px|right|thumb|Figure 5. The consumer's side: preference of expenditures in Dutch households.]]
[[File:Spending.JPG|340px|right|thumb|Figure 6. The EVR and the total expenditures of all consumers in the EU25 (from EIPRO)]]
In economics, de-linking (also known as [[Decoupling (organizational studies)|decoupling]]) is often used in the context of economic production and environmental quality. In this context, it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without corresponding increases in environmental pressure. In many economies increasing production (GDP) would involve increased pressure on the environment. An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth, without also experiencing a worsening of environmental conditions, is said to be de-linked.

There is a consumer's side of the de-linking of economy and ecology. Under the assumption that most of the households spend in their life what they earn in their life, the total EVR of the spending of households is the key towards sustainability. Only when this total EVR of the spending gets lower, the eco-costs related to the total spending can be reduced even at a higher level of spending. There are two ways of achieving this: 
* At the production side: the improvement of eco-efficiency ('lowering EVR') of products and services by the industry
* At the consumer's side: the change of lifestyle of customers in the direction of 'low EVR' products.

At the production side, society is heading in the right direction: gradually, industrial production is achieving higher levels of the value/costs ratio and is at the same time becoming cleaner. At the consumer's side, however, society is suffering from the fact that the consumers preferences are heading in the wrong direction: towards products and services with an unfavourable EVR (like driving in SUVs, more kilometres, intercontinental flights for holidays). These unfavourable preferences can be concluded from Figure 5.

Figure 5 shows that people in the Netherlands (and probably in the other EC countries as well) spend relatively more money on cars and holidays when they have more money available. Other studies show that people tend to have intercontinental holidays at the moment they can afford it. This shift in consumer spending will become a big problem in the near future, since the EVR of e.g. housing and health care is much lower than the EVR of transport and (inter)continental holidays by plane. 
Figure 6 shows the EVR (= ecocosts/price) on the Y/axis as a function of the cumulative expenditures of all products and services of all citizens in the EU 25 on the X-axis. The data is from the EIPRO study of the European Commission (EIPRO = environmental impact of products).

The area underneath the curve is proportional to the total eco-costs of the EU25. Basically there are two strategies to reduce the area under the curve: - ask industry to reduce the eco-costs of their products (this will shift the curve downward) - try to reduce expenditures of consumers in high end of the curve, and let them spend this money at the low end of the curve (this will shift the middle part of the curve to the right). 
The question is now how designers and engineers can contribute to this required shift towards sustainability and what this means to product portfolio strategies of companies. The solution is Eco-efficient Value Creation.

===Eco-efficient value creation===
[[File:double objective EVR.png|350px|right|thumb|Figure 7: The double objectvive for design &amp; engineering: less eco-costs, more value.]]
The way towards sustainability requires a double aim in product innovation, see Figure 7: 
* lower eco-costs, and at the same time
* higher value (a higher market price).

We call this: eco-efficient value creation. 
The reason we need value creation for eco-efficient products is threefold:

# the higher price in the market is required to cover the higher production cost of green products (note that a higher price is only accepted by the consumer when the perceived value is higher, otherwise the consumer will not buy the product)
# the higher price prevents the rebound effect
# lowering the EVR appears the key to a sustainable development at the level of countries (Figure 6)

Below, an example of eco-efficient value creation is given, which is the introduction of the [[Lexus RX (XU30)|Lexus RX 400h]] in the USA: 
* the customer value has increased, by emphasising its combined power and comfort (from the advertisement in the US: "â¦â¦While it may have a V6 engine under the hood, the extra boost from the electric-drive motor gives the vehicle the acceleration power of a V8â¦â¦. and the noise levels in Lexus hybrid vehicles have been reduced even more")
*  the eco-costs of driving are lower, since its excellent overall fuel economy

Note that the acceleration of a car is an interesting issue in terms of value. High acceleration is associated with expensive sports cars (Porsche, Ferrari). But people who buy these fast cars hardly use it. For these people acceleration is more part of the image of the product than it is part of the product qualities they use on a daily basis. So reducing the acceleration is the wrong strategy: it eliminates the extra value, and it hardly reduces the overall eco-costs in practice.

===Environmental benchmarking in LCA===
Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the generally accepted method to compare two (or more) alternative products or services. A prerequisite for such a comparison is that the functionality ('functional unit') and the quality of the alternatives are the same (you cannot compare [[apples and oranges]] in the classical LCA). In cases of product design and architecture, however, this prerequisite seems to be a fundamental flaw in the application of LCA: the designer or architect is aiming at a better quality (in the broad sense of the word: including intangible aspects like beauty and image), so the new design never has the same quality. In some cases the functionality of the design is not the same, since the design solution is limited by a maximum budget, in some cases the functionality is the same, but the higher quality results in a higher price. In all these cases a single indicator in LCA (like the eco-costs) is not suitable for environmental benchmarking.
In these cases however, it does make sense to compare the design alternatives on the basis of the eco-costs/value ratio (EVR), where the value is the perceived customer value (the fair price). See section 3.1 on Delinking.

Example 1. Different types of armchairs differ in terms of comfort, aesthetics, etc. rather than in terms of functionality. A classical LCA (with a single indicator like eco-costs, carbon footprint, etc.) does not make sense here. Selection on the basis of EVR, however, is the key to a sustainable consumption pattern. The chair with the lowest EVR is the best solution in terms of sustainability.

Example 2. In LCA, the comparison of a new building and a renovated building is in the majority of cases not possible, since, in practice, both solutions differ in almost all quality aspects (tangible as well as intangible). However, the solution with lowest EVR is the best in terms of sustainable consumption.

Note that the renovated building is the best solution in most of the cases, because it has the lowest EVR in the production phase. However, in some cases the renovated building is not the best solution, because of unfavourable energy consumption (high EVR) in the use phase.

The proposition that '''existence precedes essence''' ({{lang-fr|l'existence prÃ©cÃ¨de l'essence}}) is a central claim of [[existentialism]], which reverses the traditional philosophical view  that the [[essence]] (the nature) of a thing is more fundamental and immutable than its [[existence]] (the mere fact of its being).&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Timaeus''; Aristotle, ''Metaphysics''; St Thomas Aquinas, ''Summa contra Gentiles'', Pars 3:1, ''Summa Theologiae'', Pars 1:1, etc. Analysis of "existence before essence" in Etienne Gilson, ''The Christian Philosophy of Saint Thomas Aquinas'', Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt; To existentialists, human beings&amp;mdash;through their [[consciousness]]&amp;mdash;create their own values and determine a meaning for their life because the human being does not possess any inherent [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or [[Value (ethics)|value]]. That identity or value must be created by the individual. By posing the acts that constitute them, they make their existence more significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} (Dictionary) "L'existencialisme" - see "l'identitÃ© de la personne"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} EncyclopÃ©die de la jeunesse, 1979, p.567&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea can be found in the works of philosopher [[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, SÃ¸ren. ''Philosophical Fragments'', 1844.&lt;/ref&gt; but was explicitly formulated by philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in the 20th century. The three-word formula originated in his 1945&lt;ref&gt;The lecture was delivered on Monday, October 29, 1945, although not published until 1946. "Existentialism is a Humanism." trans. Carol Macomber, preface by Arlene ElkaÃ¯m-Sartre, ed. John Kulka (New Haven: Yale, 2007), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; lecture "[[L'existentialisme est un humanisme|Existentialism Is a Humanism]]",&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; though antecedent notions can be found in [[Heidegger|Heidegger's]] ''[[Being and Time]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943), credits a slightly longer version of the claim to Heidegger: "Now freedom has no essence.  It is not subject to any logical necessity; we must say of it what Heidegger said of the ''Dasein'' in general: 'In it existence precedes and commands essence.'"  However, Sartre gives no page reference for this citation.  In ''Being and Time'', Heidegger writes: "The 'essence' of human-being lies in its existence." ("Das 'Wesen' des Daseins liegt in seiner Existenz", ''Sein und Zeit'', p. 42.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sartre's view==
The [[Sartre]]an claim is best understood in contrast to an established principle of [[metaphysics]]{{dubious|date=April 2012}} that ''essence'' precedes ''existence'', i.e. a typical claim for this traditional thesis would be that man is essentially selfish, or that he is a rational being.

To Sartre,  "existence precedes essence" means that a [[Personality development|personality]] is not built over a previously designed model or a precise purpose, because it is the human being who [[free will|chooses]] to engage in such enterprise. While not denying the constraining conditions of human existence, he answers to [[Spinoza]] who affirmed that man is determined by what surrounds him. Therefore, to Sartre an [[oppression|oppressive situation]] is not intolerable in itself, but once regarded as such by those who feel oppressed the situation ''becomes'' intolerable. So by projecting my intentions onto my present condition, "It is I who freely transform it into action". When he said that "the world is a [[mirror]] of my [[Political freedom|freedom]]", he meant that the world obliged me to react, to overtake myself. It is this overtaking of a present constraining situation by a project to come that Sartre names [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. He added that "we are condemned to be free".&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}}
[http://www.philagora.net/philo-bac/anthro10.htm Philagora.net -Notions de philosophie, L'existencialisme: Jean-Paul Sartre] (Notions of Philosophy, Existentialism)&lt;/ref&gt;

When it is said that man defines himself, it is often perceived as stating that man can "wish" to be something â anything, a bird, for instance â and then be it. According to Sartre's account, however, this would be a kind of [[Bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]. What is meant by the statement is that man is (1) defined only insofar as he acts and (2) that he is responsible for his actions. To clarify, it can be said that a man who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel man and in that same instance, he (as opposed to his genes, for instance) is defined as being responsible for being this cruel man. Of course, the more positive therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: You can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person. Here it is also clear that since man can choose to be either cruel or good, he is, in fact, neither of these things ''essentially''.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

To claim that existence precedes essence is to assert that there is no such predetermined essence to be found in humans, and that an individual's essence is defined by the individual through how that individual creates and lives his or her life. As Sartre puts it in his [[Existentialism is a Humanism]]: "man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world â and defines himself afterwards".&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, ''Existentialism is a humanism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Existentialism tends to focus on the question of human existence and the conditions of this existence. What is meant by existence is the concrete life of each individual, and their concrete ways of being in the world. Even though this concrete individual existence must be the primary source of information in the study of people, certain conditions are commonly held to be "endemic" to human existence. These conditions are usually in some way related to the inherent meaninglessness or absurdity of the earth and its apparent contrast with our pre-reflexive lived lives which normally present themselves to us as meaningful. A central theme is that since the world "in-itself" is absurd, that is, not "fair", then a meaningful life can at any point suddenly lose all its meaning. The reasons why this happens are many, ranging from a tragedy that "tears a person's world apart", to the results of an honest inquiry into one's own existence. Such an encounter can make a person mentally unstable, and avoiding such instability by making people aware of their condition and ready to handle it is one of the central themes of existentialism. [[Albert Camus]], for instance, famously claimed in ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus|Le Mythe de Sisyphe]]'' that "there is only one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide".&lt;ref&gt;Camus, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from these "psychological" issues, it is also claimed that these encounters with the absurd are where we are most in touch with our condition as humans. Such an encounter cannot be without philosophical significance, and existentialist philosophers derive many metaphysical theories from these encounters. These are often related to [[self|the self]], [[consciousness]] and [[free will|freedom]] as well as the nature of meaning.

==Overview==
Each author has recorded the subjective experiences of various persons in violent environments and surroundings. These are the perspectives of the offenders, victims, noncombatants, soldiers, insurgents, black marketers, heroes, scavengers and researchers. Articles also show how anthropologists are often compelled to create innovative data gathering strategies when working in the midst of dangerous environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4054">In [[category theory]], '''filtered categories''' generalize the notion of [[directed set]] understood as a category (hence called a  directed category; while some use directed category as a synonym for a filtered category). There is a dual notion of '''cofiltered''' category which will be recalled below. 

==Filtered categories==

A [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is '''filtered''' when
* it is not empty,
* for every two objects &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; there exists an object &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and two arrows &lt;math&gt;f:j\to k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f':j'\to k&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;,
* for every two parallel arrows &lt;math&gt;u,v:i\to j&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an object &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and an arrow &lt;math&gt;w:j\to k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;wu=wv&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''filtered colimit''' is a [[colimit]] of a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;F:J\to C&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a filtered category. 

==Cofiltered categories==
A category &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is cofiltered if the [[opposite category]] &lt;math&gt;J^{\mathrm{op}}&lt;/math&gt; is filtered.  In detail, a category is cofiltered when
* it is not empty
* for every two objects &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; there exists an object &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and two arrows &lt;math&gt;f:k\to j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f':k \to j'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;,
* for every two parallel arrows &lt;math&gt;u,v:j\to i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an object &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and an arrow &lt;math&gt;w:k\to j&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;uw=vw&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''cofiltered limit''' is a [[limit (category theory)|limit]] of a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;F:J \to C&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a cofiltered category.

==Ind-objects and pro-objects==

Given a small category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, a [[Presheaf_(category_theory)|presheaf]] of sets &lt;math&gt;C^{op}\to Set&lt;/math&gt; that is a small filtered colimit of representable presheaves, is called an '''ind-object''' of the category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Ind-objects of a category &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; form a full subcategory &lt;math&gt;Ind(C)&lt;/math&gt; in the category of functors (presheaves) &lt;math&gt;C^{op}\to Set&lt;/math&gt;. The category &lt;math&gt;Pro(C)=Ind(C^{op})^{op}&lt;/math&gt; of pro-objects in &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is the opposite of the category of ind-objects in the opposite category &lt;math&gt;C^{op}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Îº-filtered categories==
There is a variant of "filtered category" known as a "Îº-filtered category", defined as follows. This begins with the following observation: the three conditions in the definition of filtered category above say respectively that there exists a [[cone (category theory)|cocone]] over any diagram in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;\{\ \ \}\rightarrow J&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\{j\ \ \ j'\}\rightarrow J&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\{i\rightrightarrows j\}\rightarrow J&lt;/math&gt;. The existence of cocones for these three shapes of diagrams turns out to imply that cocones exist for ''any'' finite diagram; in other words, a category &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is filtered (according to the above definition) if and only if there is a cocone over any ''finite'' diagram &lt;math&gt;d: D\to J&lt;/math&gt;.

Extending this, given a regular cardinal Îº, a category &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be Îº-filtered if there is a cocone over every diagram &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; of cardinality smaller than Îº. (A small [[Diagram_(category_theory)|diagram]] is of cardinality Îº if the morphism set of its domain is of cardinality Îº.)

A Îº-filtered (co)limit is a (co)limit of a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;F:J\to C&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a Îº-filtered category.

In the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, the '''five hindrances''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''à¤ªà¤à¥à¤ à¤¨à¤¿à¤µà¤°à¤£ paÃ±ca nivÄraá¹a''; [[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|à¤ªà¤à¥à¤ à¤¨à¥à¤µà¤°à¤£à¤¾à¤¨à¤¿ paÃ±ca nÄ«varaá¹Äni}}'') are identified  as [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] that hinder progress in [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and in our daily lives.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}} In the [[Theravada]] tradition, these factors are identified specifically as obstacles to the [[jhÄna]]s (stages of concentration) within meditation practice. Within the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the five hindrances are identified as obstacles to [[samatha]] (tranquility) meditation. Contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] teachers identify the five hindrances as obstacles to [[mindfulness meditation]].

==Overview==

===Within the Buddhist traditions===
The five hindrances are identified in the major Buddhist traditions of [[Theravada Buddhism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], as well in the contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] tradition. But the hindrances are presented differently within these different traditions, depending upon the way each tradition teaches the practice of meditation.

;Contemporary Insight Meditation:
Contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] teacher [[Gil Fronsdal]] describes the hindrances as "a very important list of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental states]] that have a big impact on meditation practice and peopleâs daily lives." Fronsdal emphasizes that it is important not to see the hindrances as personal failings. All human beings have them. A big part of mindfulness meditation is to learn about these hindrances in order to become free of them. Therefore, Fronsdal states, the goal is to not dismiss them, but to study them and understand them really well.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}

Contemporary teacher [[Jack Kornfield]] described the five hindrances as "difficult energies which arise in the mind and in one's life as a part of meditation practice."&lt;ref group=web name=k1&gt;[http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html The Five Hindrances-2 by Jack Kornfield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026134307/http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html |date=2012-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Theravada tradition:
Contemporary Theravada scholar Nina van Gorkom states: "The hindrances are obstructions, overwhelming the mind, weakening insight.[...] The hindrances obstruct the development of what is wholesome."&lt;ref group=web name=nina1&gt;[https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/cetasikas/d/doc2873.html Different Groups Of Defilements Part II, Nina van Gorkom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Theravada tradition, the five hindrances are identified specifically as obstacles to the [[jhÄna]]s (stages of concentration) within meditation. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Brahmavamso]] states:&lt;ref group=web name=b2001&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Gt5hSX0EGjkJ:www.dhammatalks.net/Books7/Ajahn_Brahm_Five_Hindrances.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjae0cxvWrUHJDKcwEZcvBx4XgEqWqqmk_0Y_nRqvACIxXjxwSh7pyCY00KOO0JW9DiKrPR_9XuNq-fZGUsqJbloC4xwLgZMfjltOqWSP8_bWvrksc_a5tjxJ9Acqea1jHfR3dm&amp;sig=AHIEtbRsGoEAn-GXCI-LWctEQin1flxZtg The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:The deliberate idea of overcoming these five hindrances is important because it is the five hindrances that block the door to both the jhÄnas, and wisdom. Itâs the five hindrances that fuel [[avijjÄ]]. The Buddha said that theyâre the nutriments, the food of delusion.

Ajahn Brahmavamso emphasizes that any obstacle that arises in meditation can be identified as one of the five hindrances; he states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
:Any problem which arises in meditation will be one of these Five Hindrances, or a combination. So, if one experiences any difficulty, use the scheme of the Five Hindrances as a 'check list' to identify the main problem. Then you will know the appropriate remedy, apply it carefully, and go beyond the obstacle into deeper meditation. When the Five Hindrances are fully overcome, there is no barrier between the meditator and the bliss of Jhana. Therefore, the certain test that these Five Hindrances are really overcome is the ability to access Jhana.

;Mahayana tradition:
Within the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances are typically identified as obstacles to [[samatha]] meditation (also referred to as tranquility meditation).{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}

===Overcoming the hindrances===
All of the Buddhist traditions emphasize that the hindrances are overcome by investigating and understanding them. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Sumedho]] states:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/sumedho/fivehind.html The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Sumedho]&lt;/ref&gt;
: In meditation one develops an understanding of the Five Hindrances -- how, when one of them is present, you investigate it, you understand it, you accept its presence and you learn how to deal with it. Sometimes you can just tell it to go away and it goes; sometimes you just have to allow it to be there till it wears out.

Contemporary Insight Meditation teacher Gil Fronsdal emphasizes that to be a good student of the hindrances, you must be very patient with them and not be dismissive of them. When they arise, you must stop for them. Fronsdal states that a bumper sticker for this type of training could be âI stop for the hindrances.â You donât indulge them, Fronsdal states, you become interested and study them.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}

The Insight Meditation tradition teaches the RAIN formula for investigating the hindrances:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/FiveHindrances.pdf Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation: The Five Hindrances (study notes)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=brach&gt;[http://www.tarabrach.com/howtomeditate.html How to Meditate: A Guide to Formal Sitting Practice, by Tara Brach]&lt;/ref&gt;

* R: Recognize it.
* A: Accept it.
* I: Investigate it, be curious. What is it like?
* N: Non-identification. This is just a passing process that comes and goes, not who we are.

==The five hindrances individually==

===1. Sensory desire (kamacchanda) ===
The hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on the pleasures of the five senses.
* Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999) states: "Sensory desire refers to that particular type of wanting that seeks for happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling. It specifically excludes any aspiration for happiness through the sixth sense of mind alone. In its extreme form, sensory desire is an obsession to find pleasure in such things as sexual intimacy, good food or fine music. But it also includes the desire to replace irritating or even painful five-sense experiences with pleasant ones, i.e. the desire for sensory comfort."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1&gt;[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebmed051.htm The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001) states: "[...] kÄma chanda are anything from the extremes of lust to just being concerned with how the body is doing. Thinking about the letter that you have to write afterwards, about the rain pattering on your roof, about your kutÄ« [monk's hut], or what needs to be built next, or where you are going to next, thatâs all in the kÄmaloka, the world of the senses, thatâs all kÄma chanda. Itâs also kÄma vitakka, or the thoughts about those things, about family, about health, about coming here, going there, and thoughts about words.&lt;ref group=web name=b2001/&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2016}}
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "This term alludes to the mind's tendency to latch on to something that attracts it--a thought, a visual object, or a particular emotion. When we allow the mind to indulge in such attractions, we lose our concentration. So we need to apply mindfulness and be aware of how the mind operates; we don't necessarily have to suppress all these things arising in the mind, but we should take notice of them and see how the mind behaves, how it automatically grabs onto this and that."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}

;Analogy
The hindrance of sensory desire is compared to taking out a loan â any pleasure one experiences through these five senses must be repaid through the unpleasantness of separation or loss which invariably follow when the pleasure is used up. There is also interest to be repaid on the loan. Thus, the Buddha said that the pleasure is small compared to the suffering repaid.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote
In order to overcome the hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda''), the meditator must first apply mindfulness and recognize that the hindrance is present.{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}&lt;ref group=web name=cards1&gt;[http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html Five Hindrances Bodhi Cards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831220653/http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html |date=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then one must look at the hindrance, analyze it, make it the object of our meditation, experience it fully. The meditator can then apply specific techniques such as contemplating the impermanence of the pleasant desire.&lt;ref group=web name=cards1/&gt;
 
Ajahn Brahmavamso emphasizes the technique of letting go of concern for the body and the five senses completely; he states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
:In meditation, one transcends sensory desire for the period by letting go of concern for this body and its five sense activity. Some imagine that the five senses are there to serve and protect the body, but the truth is that the body is there to serve the five senses as they play in the world ever seeking delight. Indeed, the Lord Buddha once said, "The five senses ARE the world" and to leave the world, to enjoy the other worldly bliss of Jhana, one must give up for a time ALL concern for the body and its five senses.

;Etymology
Kamacchanda can be compared to giving your approval for ''[[kÄma]]''-based thoughts and emotions to remain in your mind. It is allowing these thoughts to occupy your mind. Ajahn Brahmavamso explains:&lt;ref group=web name=b2001/&gt;
:In the PÄli term ''kÄma chanda'', ''chanda'' is what you have to do if you cannot attend a meeting of the community of monks, and you want to give approval and agreement to whatâs happening there, you give your ''chanda'' to go ahead in your absence. Itâs agreement, approval, consent, and itâs much more subtle than mere desire. This means that you are buying into, giving in to this, you want it, you approve of it, and you allow it to happen. In the same way that we have ''chanda'' in the Vinaya, we have that ''kÄma chanda''. Itâs as if you give your approval for the sensory world to be in your consciousness, in your mind, you accept it, approve of it, and you play with it, thatâs all ''chanda''. Itâs letting it completely occupy the mind, and itâs much more subtle than just mere desire. The kÄma part of ''kÄma chanda'', thatâs all that is comprised in kÄmaloka, the world of the five senses, which goes from the hell realms, the animal realms, the ghost realms, the human realm, and the Deva realms, to everything that is concerned with those kÄmaloka realms. ''KÄma Chanda'' is acceptance, agreement, and consent for that world to occupy you.

===2. Ill will (vyapada) ===
The hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on anger, resentment, hostility, bitterness, etc.
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Ill will refers to the desire to punish, hurt or destroy. It includes sheer hatred of a person, or even a situation, and it can generate so much energy that it is both seductive and addictive. At the time, it always appears justified for such is its power that it easily corrupts our ability to judge fairly. It also includes ill will towards oneself, otherwise known as guilt, which denies oneself any possibility of happiness. In meditation, ill will can appear as dislike towards the meditation object itself, rejecting it so that one's attention is forced to wander elsewhere."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "The second hindrance is ''ill will''; it is the opposite of the first hindrance, being brought about by aversion rather than attraction. Ill will refers to all kinds of thought related to wanting to reject, feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness. When they arise, we should take note of them, not necessarily suppressing them, but seeing how they arise."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}

;Analogy
The hindrance of ill will is compared to being sick. Just as sickness denies one the freedom and happiness of health, so ill will denies one the freedom and happiness of peace.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote
The antidote to the hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is meditation on loving kindness (metta). Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
:Ill will is overcome by applying Metta, loving kindness. When it is ill will towards a person, Metta teaches one to see more in that person than all that which hurts you, to understand why that person hurt you (often because they were hurting intensely themselves), and encourages one to put aside one's own pain to look with compassion on the other. But if this is more than one can do, Metta to oneself leads one to refuse to dwell in ill will to that person, so as to stop them from hurting you further with the memory of those deeds. Similarly, if it is ill will towards oneself, Metta sees more than one's own faults, can understand one's own faults, and finds the courage to forgive them, learn from their lesson and let them go. Then, if it is ill will towards the meditation object (often the reason why a meditator cannot find peace) Metta embraces the meditation object with care and delight. For example, just as a mother has a natural Metta towards her child, so a meditator can look on their breath, say, with the very same quality of caring attention. Then it will be just as unlikely to lose the breath through forgetfulness as it is unlikely for a mother to forget her baby in the shopping mall, and it would be just as improbable to drop the breath for some distracting thought as it is for a distracted mother to drop her baby! When ill will is overcome, it allows lasting relationships with other people, with oneself and, in meditation, a lasting, enjoyable relationship with the meditation object, one that can mature into the full embrace of absorption.

===3. Sloth-torpor (thina-middha)===
{{see also|thÄ«na|middha}}

Sloth-torpor is a dull, morbid state that is characterized by unwieldiness, lack of energy, and opposition to wholesome activity.

* Traleg Kyabgon states: "When this hindrance is present, we lose our focus in meditation. We may not be agitated in any perceptible way, but there is no mental clarity. We gradually become more and more drowsy, and then eventually go to sleep."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Sloth and torpor refers to that heaviness of body and dullness of mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression. [...] In meditation, it causes weak and intermittent mindfulness which can even lead to falling asleep in meditation without even realising it!"&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "The mind has two main functions, 'doing' and 'knowing'. The way of meditation is to calm the 'doing' to complete tranquility while maintaining the 'knowing'. Sloth and torpor occur when one carelessly calms both the 'doing' and the 'knowing', unable to distinguish between them."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Sloth and torpor is an unpleasant state of body and mind, too stiff to leap into the bliss of Jhana and too blinded to spot any insights. In short, it is a complete waste of precious time."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Analogy:
The hindrance of sloth-torpor is compared to being imprisoned in a cramped, dark cell, unable to move freely in the bright sunshine outside.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote:
Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
: "Sloth and torpor is overcome by rousing energy. Energy is always available but few know how to turn on the switch, as it were. Setting a goal, a reasonable goal, is a wise and effective way to generate energy, as is deliberately developing interest in the task at hand. A young child has a natural interest, and consequent energy, because its world is so new. Thus, if one can learn to look at one's life, or one's meditation, with a 'beginner's mind' one can see ever new angles and fresh possibilities which keep one distant from sloth and torpor, alive and energetic. Similarly, one can develop delight in whatever one is doing by training one's perception to see the beautiful in the ordinary, thereby generating the interest which avoids the half-death that is sloth and torpor. [...] Sloth and torpor is a common problem which can creep up and smother one slowly. A skilful meditator keeps a sharp look-out for the first signs of sloth and torpor and is thus able to spot its approach and take evasive action before it's too late. Like coming to a fork in a road, one can take that mental path leading away from sloth and torpor."

Traleg Kyabgon states: "When this happens, instead of persisting with the meditation, it is better to try to refresh ourselves by getting up and going for a walk or washing our face, after which we return to our meditation."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}

===4. Restlessness-worry (uddhacca-kukkucca)===
{{see also|uddhacca|kukkucca}}

The hindrance of restlessness-worry (''uddhacca-kukkucca'') refers to a mind that is agitated and unable to settle down.

* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Restlessness [uddhacca] refers to a mind which is like a monkey, always swinging on to the next branch, never able to stay long with anything. It is caused by the fault-finding state of mind which cannot be satisfied with things as they are, and so has to move on to the promise of something better, forever just beyond. [...] Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the kammic effect of one's misdeeds."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "The fourth hindrance is ''restlessness and worry'', which refers to all the mental activities that go on in our mind due to its restless nature."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}
* Gil Fronsdal states: "The discomfort of restlessness creates an outward looking [tendency] â what can I do to fix this? What can I do to settle this? [...] So the challenge in restlessness is how to turn towards it and be present for it and engage it."&lt;ref group=web name=gil01&gt;[http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1808/ ''The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry'' audio talk by Gil Fronsdal]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Analogy:
Restlessness (''uddhacca'') is compared to being a slave, continually having to jump to the orders of a tyrannical boss who always demands perfection and so never lets one stop.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote:
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
** Restlessness [uddhacca] is overcome by developing contentment, which is the opposite of fault-finding. One learns the simple joy of being satisfied with little, rather than always wanting more. One is grateful for this moment, rather than picking out its deficiencies. For instance, in meditation restlessness is often the impatience to move quickly on to the next stage. The fastest progress, though is achieved by those who are content with the stage they are on now. It is the deepening of that contentment that ripens into the next stage. 
** Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the kammic effect of one's misdeeds. The only way to overcome remorse, the restlessness of a bad conscience, is to purify one's virtue and become kind, wise and gentle. It is virtually impossible for the immoral or the self-indulgent to make deep progress in meditation.
* Gil Fronsdal states: "[There are] a variety of ways to engage restlessness, be present for it. [...] [One is] learning, reflecting, meditating and contemplating what the nature of restlessness is. [...] There might be a really good cause for you to be restless. [...] Maybe you haven't paid your taxes in ten years. [...] [In this case] you don't need meditation, you need to pay your taxes. You don't use meditation to run away from the real issues of your life. [...] Sometimes what's needed is to really look and understand are there root causes for being restless."&lt;ref group=web name=gil01/&gt;

===5. Doubt (vicikicchÄ)===
{{see also|vicikicchÄ}}

The hindrance of doubt (''vicikicchÄ'') refers to doubt about one's ability to understand and implement the meditation instructions, as well as about the teacher and Buddhist teachings in general.

* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Doubt refers to the disturbing inner questions at a time when one should be silently moving deeper. Doubt can question one's own ability 'Can I do This?,' or question the method 'Is this the right way?,' or even question the meaning 'What is this?.' It should be remembered that such questions are obstacles to meditation because they are asked at the wrong time and thus become an intrusion, obscuring one's clarity."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "When we meditate in the presence of this hindrance, we have a constant nagging feeling: 'How do I know what I am doing is right? How do I know if this thing really works and if I am not just wasting my time? How do I know what the Buddhist teachings say is true? How do I know if that what the meditation teachers have taught me is right and that they are not deluded?'"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}

;Analogy:
Doubt is compared to being lost in a desert, not recognising any landmarks.

;Antidote:
Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Such doubt is overcome by gathering clear instructions, having a good map, so that one can recognise the subtle landmarks in the unfamiliar territory of deep meditation and so know which way to go. Doubt in one's ability is overcome by nurturing self-confidence with a good teacher. A meditation teacher is like a coach who convinces the sports team that they can succeed.
* The end of doubt, in meditation, is described by a mind which has full trust in the silence, and so doesn't interfere with any inner speech. Like having a good chauffeur, one sits silently on the journey out of trust in the driver.

==Mental factors that counteract the five hindrances==
B. Alan Wallace identifies five mental factors that counteract the five hindrances, according to the Theravada tradition:{{sfn|Wallace|2006|pp=158-159}}
# ''Coarse examination ([[vitakka]])'' counteracts sloth-torpor (lethargy and drowsiness)
# ''Precise investigation ([[vicÄra]])'' counteracts doubt (uncertainty)
# ''Well-being ([[pÄ«ti]])'' counteracts ill-will (malice)
# ''Bliss ([[sukha]])'' counteracts restlessness-worry (excitation and anxiety)
# ''Single-pointed attention ([[ekaggatÄ]])'' counteracts sensory desire

These five counteracting factors arise during the first [[DhyÄna in Buddhism#Stages of jhÄna|jhÄna]] (stage of concentration).

==In Pali Literature==

===In the Pali Canon===
In the [[Pali Canon]]'s [[Samyutta Nikaya]], several discourses juxtapose the five hindrances with the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''bojjhanga'').{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For example, in [[Samyutta Nikaya]] chapter 46, ''Bojjhanga-samyutta'', discourses 46.31 through 46.40 are based on this juxtaposition (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1589-94).}}  For instance, according to [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.37, [[the Buddha]] stated:
:"[[Bhikkhu]]s, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, corruptions of the mind, weakeners of wisdom.  What five? Sensual desire... ill will... sloth and torpor ... restlessness and remorse... doubt....
:"There are, bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment, which are nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation.  What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness... [discrimination of states... energy... rapture... tranquility... concentration...] equanimity....&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1591-92&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bodhi (2000) elides the middle five factors of enlightenment, inserted here in square brackets, since all seven factors of enlightenment are identified previously multiple times in Bodhi's text.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|AnÄlayo (2006), pp. 239-40, underlines:
:"To overcome the hindrances, to practise ''[[satipatthana]]'', and to establish the awakening factors are, indeed, according to several Pali discourses, the key aspects and the distinctive features common to the awakenings of all Buddhas, past, present, and future."
AnÄlayo further supports this by identifying that, in all extant Sanskrit and Chinese versions of the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], only the five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment are consistently identified under the ''dhamma'' contemplation section; contemplations of the [[five aggregates]], six [[sense base]]s and Four Noble Truths are not included in one or more of these non-Pali versions.}}

In terms of gaining [[vipassana|insight]] into and overcoming the Five Hindrances, according to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], the Buddha proclaimed:
:How, monks, does a monk live contemplating mental objects in the mental objects of the five hindrances?

:Herein, monks, when sense-desire is present, a monk knows, "There is sense-desire in me," or when sense-desire is not present, he knows, "There is no sense-desire in me." He knows how the arising of the non-arisen sense-desire comes to be; he knows how the abandoning of the arisen sense-desire comes to be; and he knows how the non-arising in the future of the abandoned sense-desire comes to be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.nysa.html Nyanasatta (1994).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the remaining four hindrances are similarly treated in subsequent paragraphs.

The Buddha gives the following analogies in the ''SamaÃ±Ã±aphala Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 2, "The Fruits of the Contemplative Life"): 
:"... [W]hen these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html Thanissaro (1997).]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Some correlate each individual hindrance with its sequentially matched metaphor, so that covetness is likened to being in debt, having ill will to sickness, sloth and torpor to imprisonment, having restlessness and anxiety to slavery, and doubt to traveling through uncertain terrain.}}

Similarly, in the ''Sa{{IAST|á¹}}gÄrava Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.55), the Buddha compares sensual desire with looking for a clear reflection in water mixed with [[lac]], turmeric and dyes; ill will with boiling water; sloth-and-torpor with water covered with plants and algae; restlessness-and-worry with wind-churned water; and, doubt with water that is "turbid, unsettled, muddy, placed in the dark."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1611-15; Walshe (1985), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-60 sutta 60], pp. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the first-century CE exegetic ''[[Vimuttimagga]]'', the five hindrances include all ten "[[Fetters (Buddhism)|fetters]]": sense desire includes any attachment to passion; ill will includes all unwholesome states of hatred; and, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt include all unwholesome states of infatuation.  The Vimuttimagga further distinguishes that "sloth" refers to mental states while "torpor" refers to physical states resultant from food or time or mental states; if torpor results from food or time, then one diminishes it through energy; otherwise, one removes it with meditation.  In addition, the Vimuttimagga identifies four types of doubt: 
* doubt regarding [[anatta|self]] is a hindrance to [[samatha|tranquility]];
* doubt regarding the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[tiloka|three worlds]] is a hindrance to [[vipassana|insight]];
* doubt regarding the [[Triple Gem]] is a hindrance to both tranquility and insight;
* doubt regarding places and people is a hindrance to "non-doctrinal" things;
* doubt regarding the [[Tipitaka|Discourses]] is a hindrance to solitude.&lt;ref&gt;Upatissa ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Buddhaghosa]]'s fifth-century CE commentary to the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] (''{{IAST|SÄratthappakÄsinÄ«}}''), one can momentarily escape the hindrances through [[jhana|jhanic]] suppression or through [[vipassana|insight]] while, as also stated in the ''Vimuttimagga'', one eradicates the hindrances through attainment of one of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] (see Table 1).{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Regarding the ''{{IAST|SÄratthappakÄsinÄ«}}'' commentary, see Bodhi (2005), p. 440, ''n''. 14.  Regarding the ''Vimuttimagga'' commentary, see Upatissa ''et al.'' (1995), p. 316.}}

==Etymology==
According to Gil Fronsdal, the Pali term ''nÄ«varaá¹a'' means covering. Fronsdal states that these hindrances cover over: the clarity of our mind, and our ability to be mindful, wise, concentrated, and stay on purpose.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}

According to Rhys Davids, the Pali term ''nÄ«varaá¹a'' (Sanskrit: ''nivÄraá¹a'') refers to an obstacle or hindrance only in the ethical sense, and is usually enumerated in a set of five.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120629231520/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:669.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 376], entry for "{{IAST|NÄ«varaá¹a}}."&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''floodgate effect''' is situation in which a small action can result in a far greater effect with no easily discernible limit.  The original [[analogy]] is that of a [[floodgate]], which once opened, no matter how minutely, will allow water to flow from either side through the gate until both sides are balanced up.  It may also be used to refer to the effect where, once a floodgate has been opened, water will gush out in a torrent through the gate, making it easier to continue to open the gate, but harder to close it.

The term is commonly used to illustrate a situation where a precedent will set the stage for repeated performances, the number of which is hard to control. Such an example can be illustrated as follows:

''The setting up of a [[redlight district]] here will create a floodgate effect, causing redlight districts to be set up elsewhere.''

The '''fundamental theorem of calculus''' is a [[theorem]] that links the concept of [[derivative|differentiating]] a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with the concept of [[integral|integrating]] a function. 

The first part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''first fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that one of the [[antiderivative]]s (also called ''indefinite integral''), say ''F'', of some function ''f'' may be obtained as the integral of ''f'' with a variable bound of integration. This implies the existence of [[antiderivative]]s for [[continuous function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spivak|first=Michael|year=1980|title=Calculus|edition=2nd|publication-place=Houston, Texas|publisher=Publish or Perish Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the second part of the theorem, sometimes called the '''second fundamental theorem of calculus''', states that the integral of a function ''f'' over some interval can be computed by using any one, say ''F'', of its infinitely many [[antiderivative]]s. This part of the theorem has key practical applications, because explicitly finding the antiderivative of a function by [[symbolic integration]] avoids [[numerical integration]] to compute integrals. This provides generally a better numerical accuracy.

==History==
{{See also|History of calculus}}

The fundamental theorem of calculus relates differentiation and integration, showing that these two operations are essentially inverses of one another. Before the discovery of this theorem, it was not recognized that these two operations were related. Ancient [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematicians]] knew how to compute area via [[infinitesimals]], an operation that we would now call [[Integral|integration]]. The origins of [[Derivative|differentiation]] likewise predate the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by hundreds of years;  for example, in the fourteenth century the notions of ''continuity'' of functions and ''motion'' were studied by the [[Oxford Calculators]] and other scholars. The historical relevance of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is not the ability to calculate these operations, but the realization that the two seemingly distinct operations (calculation of geometric areas, and calculation of velocities) are actually closely related.

The first published statement and proof of a rudimentary form of the fundamental theorem, strongly geometric in character,&lt;ref name=GregoryGeometry&gt;{{cite journal| last=Malet|first=Antoni|title=James Gregorie on tangents and the "Taylor" rule for series expansions| publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]|year=1993|journal=[[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]|doi=10.1007/BF00375656|quote=Gregorie's thought, on the other hand, belongs to a conceptual framework strongly geometrical in character. (page 137)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was by [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1638â1675).&lt;ref&gt;
See, e.g., Marlow Anderson, Victor J. Katz, Robin J. Wilson, ''Sherlock Holmes in Babylon and Other Tales of Mathematical History'', Mathematical Association of America, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BKRE5AjRM3AC&amp;pg=PA114 p.&amp;nbsp;114].

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646â1716) systematized the knowledge into a calculus for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation used today.

==Geometric meaning==
[[File:FTC_geometric.svg|500px|thumb|right|The area shaded in red stripes is close to ''h'' times ''f''(''x''). Alternatively, if the function ''A''(''x'') were known, this area would be exactly {{nowrap|''A''(''x'' + ''h'') â ''A''(''x'').}} These two values are approximately equal, particularly for small ''h''.]]
For a continuous function {{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} whose graph is plotted as a curve, each value of ''x'' has a corresponding area function ''A''(''x''), representing the area beneath the curve between 0 and ''x''. The function ''A''(''x'') may not be known, but it is given that it represents the area under the curve.

The area under the curve between ''x'' and {{nowrap|''x'' + ''h''}} could be computed by finding the area between 0 and {{nowrap|''x'' + ''h'',}} then subtracting the area between 0 and ''x''. In other words, the area of this âstripâ would be {{nowrap|''A''(''x'' + ''h'') â ''A''(''x'')}}.

There is another way to ''estimate'' the area of this same strip. As shown in the accompanying figure, ''h'' is multiplied by ''f''(''x'') to find the area of a rectangle that is approximately the same size as this strip. So:

:&lt;math&gt;A(x+h)-A(x) \approx f(x) \cdot h&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, this estimate becomes a perfect equality if we add the red portion of the "excess" area shown in the diagram. So:

:&lt;math&gt;A(x+h)-A(x)=f(x)\cdot h+(\text{Red Excess})&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging terms:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h} - \frac{\text{Red Excess}}{h}&lt;/math&gt;.

As ''h'' approaches 0 in the [[limit of a function|limit]], the last fraction can be shown to go to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lipman Bers|Bers, Lipman]]. ''Calculus'', pp.&amp;nbsp;180â181 (Holt, Rinehart and Winston (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This is true because the area of the red portion of excess region is less than or equal to the area of the tiny black-bordered rectangle.  More precisely,
:&lt;math&gt;\left|f(x) - \frac{A(x+h) - A(x)}{h}\right| = \frac{|\text{Red Excess}|}{h} \le \frac{h(f(x+h_1) - f(x+h_2))}{h} = f(x+h_1) - f(x+h_2)|,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;x+h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+h_2&lt;/math&gt; are points where {{mvar|f}} reaches its maximum and its minimum, respectively, in  the interval {{math|[''x'', ''x'' + ''h'']}}.
By the continuity of {{math|''f''}}, the latter expression tends to zero as {{math|''h''}} does.  Therefore, the left-hand side tends to zero as {{math|''h''}} does, which implies
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}.&lt;/math&gt;
This implies {{math|''f''(''x'') {{=}} ''A''â²(''x'')}}. That is, the derivative of the area function ''A''(''x'') exists and is the original function ''f''(''x''); so, the area function is simply an [[antiderivative]] of the original function.  Computing the derivative of a function and âfinding the areaâ under its curve are "opposite" operations. This is the crux of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

==Physical intuition==
Intuitively, the theorem simply states that the sum of [[infinitesimal]] changes in a quantity over time (or over some other variable) adds up to the net change in the quantity.

Imagine for example using a stopwatch to mark-off tiny increments of time as a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car. To understand the power of this theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed to look out the window of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.

For any tiny interval of time in the car, you could calculate how far the car has traveled in that interval by multiplying the current speed of the car times the length of that tiny interval of time. (This is because ''distance'' = ''speed'' &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ''time''.)

Now imagine doing this instant after instant, so that for every tiny interval of time you know how far the car has traveled. In principle, you could then calculate the ''total'' distance traveled in the car (even though you've never looked out the window) by simply summing-up all those tiny distances.

:distance traveled = &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; the velocity at any instant &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; a tiny interval of time

In other words,

:distance traveled = &lt;math&gt;\sum v(t) \times \Delta t&lt;/math&gt;

On the right hand side of this equation, as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; becomes infinitesimally small, the operation of "summing up" corresponds to [[Integral|integration]]. So what we've shown is that the integral of the velocity function can be used to compute how far the car has traveled.

Now remember that the velocity function is simply the derivative of the position function. So what we have really shown is that integrating the velocity simply recovers the original position function. This is the basic idea of the theorem: that ''integration'' and ''differentiation'' are closely related operations, each essentially being the inverse of the other.

In other words, in terms of one's physical intuition, the theorem simply states that the sum of the changes in a quantity over time (such as ''position'', as calculated by multiplying ''velocity'' times ''time'') adds up to the total net change in the quantity. Or to put this more generally:
* Given a quantity &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that changes over some variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and
* Given the velocity &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt; with which that quantity changes over that variable
then the idea that "distance equals speed times time" corresponds to the statement
:&lt;math&gt;dx = v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;
meaning that one can recover the original function &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; by integrating its derivative, the velocity &lt;math&gt;v(t)&lt;/math&gt;, over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal statements==
There are two parts to the theorem. The first part deals with the derivative of an [[antiderivative]], while the second part deals with the relationship between antiderivatives and [[definite integral]]s.

===First part===
This part is sometimes referred to as the ''first fundamental theorem of calculus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=Â§5.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''f'' be a continuous real-valued function defined on a [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|closed interval]] [''a'', ''b'']. Let ''F'' be the function defined, for all ''x'' in [''a'', ''b''], by
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x\!f(t)\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Then, ''F'' is uniformly continuous on [''a'', ''b''], differentiable on the open interval {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b''),}} and

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' in (''a'', ''b'').

===Corollary===
[[File:Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus_(animation_).gif|thumb|Fundamental theorem of calculus (animation)]]

The fundamental theorem is often employed to compute the definite integral of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; for which an antiderivative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is known.  Specifically, if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a real-valued continuous function on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(t)\, dt = F(b)-F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

The corollary assumes [[Continuous function|continuity]] on the whole interval. This result is strengthened slightly in the following part of the theorem.

===Second part===
This part is sometimes referred to as the second fundamental theorem of calculus&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apostol|1967|loc=Â§5.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''NewtonâLeibniz axiom'''.

Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be a real-valued function on a [[closed interval]] &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;F'(x) = f(x).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[Riemann integrable]] on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

The second part is somewhat stronger than the corollary because it does not assume that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

When an antiderivative &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; exists, then there are infinitely many antiderivatives for &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, obtained by adding  an arbitrary constant to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Also, by the first part of the theorem, antiderivatives of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; always exist when &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

==Proof of the first part==
For a given ''f''(''t''), define the function ''F''(''x'') as
:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

For any two numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Î''x'' in [''a'', ''b''], we have
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1) = \int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Subtracting the two equalities gives
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt - \int_a^{x_1} f(t) \,dt. \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

It can be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt + \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt = \int_a^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;
:(The sum of the areas of two adjacent regions is equal to the area of both regions combined.)
Manipulating this equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{a}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt - \int_{a}^{x_1} f(t) \,dt = \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into (1) results in
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = \int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt. \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[mean value theorem]] for integration, there exists a real number &lt;math&gt;c \in [x_1, x_1 + \Delta x]&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{x_1}^{x_1 + \Delta x} f(t) \,dt = f(c)\cdot \Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

To keep the notation simple, we write just &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, but one should keep in mind that, for a given function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the value of &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and on &lt;math&gt;\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt; but is always confined to the interval  &lt;math&gt; [x_1, x_1 + \Delta x]&lt;/math&gt;.
Substituting the above into (2) we get
:&lt;math&gt;F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1) = f(c)\cdot \Delta x.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; gives
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1)}{\Delta x} = f(c).&lt;/math&gt;
:The expression on the left side of the equation is Newton's [[difference quotient]] for ''F'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Take the limit as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; â 0 on both sides of the equation.
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{F(x_1 + \Delta x) - F(x_1)}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(c). &lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the left side of the equation is the definition of the derivative of ''F'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} f(c). \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;

To find the other limit, we use the [[squeeze theorem]]. The number ''c'' is in the interval [''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Î''x''], so ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; â¤ ''c'' â¤ ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + Î''x''.

Also, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x_1 = x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} x_1 + \Delta x = x_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, according to the squeeze theorem,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} c = x_1.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into (3), we get
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = \lim_{c \to x_1} f(c).&lt;/math&gt;

The function ''f'' is continuous at ''c'', so the limit can be taken inside the function. Therefore, we get
:&lt;math&gt;F'(x_1) = f(x_1).&lt;/math&gt;
which completes the proof.

&lt;small&gt;(Leithold ''et al.'', 1996)&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt; (a rigorous proof can be found http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=438)&lt;/small&gt;

==Proof of the corollary==
Suppose ''F'' is an antiderivative of ''f'', with ''f'' continuous on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}} Let

: &lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;.

By the ''first part'' of the theorem, we know ''G'' is also an antiderivative of ''f''. Since ''F' - G' = 0'' the mean value theorem implies that ''F - G'' is a constant function, i. e. there is a number ''c'' such that {{nowrap|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''F''(''x'') + ''c''}}, for all ''x'' in {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  Letting {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''a''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;F(a) + c = G(a) = \int_a^a f(t)\, dt = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

which means {{nowrap|''c'' {{=}} â ''F''(''a'').}} In other words, {{nowrap|''G''(''x'') {{=}} ''F''(''x'') â ''F''(''a'')}}, and so

:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = G(b) = F(b) - F(a).&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof of the second part==
This is a limit proof by [[Riemann integral|Riemann sums]].
Let ''f'' be (Riemann) integrable on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''],}} and let ''f'' admit an antiderivative ''F'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  Begin with the quantity {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') â ''F''(''a'')}}.  Let there be numbers ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
such that

:&lt;math&gt;a = x_0 &lt; x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; x_{n-1} &lt; x_n = b. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = F(x_n) - F(x_0). &lt;/math&gt;

Now, we add each ''F''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) along with its additive inverse, so that the resulting quantity is equal:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F(b) - F(a)
&amp;= F(x_n) + [-F(x_{n-1}) + F(x_{n-1})] + \cdots + [-F(x_1) + F(x_1)] - F(x_0) \\
&amp;= [F(x_n) - F(x_{n-1})] + [F(x_{n-1}) - F(x_{n-2})] + \cdots + [F(x_2) - F(x_1)] + [F(x_1) - F(x_0)].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The above quantity can be written as the following sum:

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1})]. \qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

Next, we employ the [[mean value theorem]].  Stated briefly,

Let ''F'' be continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on the open interval (''a'', ''b''). Then there exists some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') such that

:&lt;math&gt;F'(c) = \frac{F(b) - F(a)}{b - a}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that

:&lt;math&gt;F'(c)(b - a) = F(b) - F(a). &lt;/math&gt;

The function ''F'' is differentiable on the interval {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''];}} therefore, it is also differentiable and continuous on each interval {{nowrap|[''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''â1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]}}.  According to the mean value theorem (above),

:&lt;math&gt;F(x_i) - F(x_{i-1}) = F'(c_i)(x_i - x_{i-1}). &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above into (1), we get

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[F'(c_i)(x_i - x_{i-1})].&lt;/math&gt;

The assumption implies &lt;math&gt;F'(c_i) = f(c_i).&lt;/math&gt;  Also, &lt;math&gt;x_i - x_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; of partition &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)]. \qquad (2)&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Riemann integral irregular.gif|frame|right|A converging sequence of Riemann sums. The number in the upper left is the total area of the blue rectangles. They converge to the definite integral of the function.]]

We are describing the area of a rectangle, with the width times the height, and we are adding the areas together.  Each rectangle, by virtue of the [[mean value theorem]], describes an approximation of the curve section it is drawn over. Also &lt;math&gt;\Delta x_i&lt;/math&gt; need not be the same for all values of ''i'', or in other words that the width of the rectangles can differ.  What we have to do is approximate the curve with ''n'' rectangles.  Now, as the size of the partitions get smaller and ''n'' increases, resulting in more partitions to cover the space, we get closer and closer to the actual area of the curve.

By taking the limit of the expression as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the [[Riemann integral]]. We know that this limit exists because ''f'' was assumed to be integrable. That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.

So, we take the limit on both sides of (2). This gives us

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} F(b) - F(a) = \lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)].&lt;/math&gt;

Neither ''F''(''b'') nor ''F''(''a'') is dependent on &lt;math&gt;\|\Delta x_i\|&lt;/math&gt;, so the limit on the left side remains {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') â ''F''(''a'').}}

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \lim_{\| \Delta x_i \| \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^n \,[f(c_i)(\Delta x_i)].&lt;/math&gt;

The expression on the right side of the equation defines the integral over ''f'' from ''a'' to ''b''. Therefore, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx,&lt;/math&gt;

which completes the proof.

It almost looks like the first part of the theorem follows directly from the second. That is, suppose ''G'' is an antiderivative of ''f''. Then by the second theorem, &lt;math&gt;G(x) - G(a) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;. Now, suppose &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt\ = G(x) - G(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''F'' has the same derivative as ''G'', and therefore {{nowrap|''F''â² {{=}} ''f''}}. This argument only works, however, if we already know that ''f'' has an antiderivative, and the only way we know that all continuous functions have antiderivatives is by the first part of the Fundamental Theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Spivak|first=Michael|year=1980|title=Calculus|edition=2nd|publication-place=Houston, Texas|publisher=Publish or Perish Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, if {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} e&lt;sup&gt;â''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;,}} then ''f'' has an antiderivative, namely

:&lt;math&gt;G(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

and there is no simpler expression for this function.  It is therefore important not to interpret the second part of the theorem as the definition of the integral.  Indeed, there are many functions that are integrable but lack elementary antiderivatives, and discontinuous functions can be integrable but lack any antiderivatives at all.  Conversely, many functions that have antiderivatives are not Riemann integrable (see [[Volterra's function]]).

==Examples==
As an example, suppose the following is to be calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_2^5 x^2\, dx. &lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;f(x) = x^2 &lt;/math&gt; and we can use &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} &lt;/math&gt; as the antiderivative. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\int_2^5 x^2\, dx = F(5) - F(2) =  \frac{5^3}{3} - \frac{2^3}{3} = \frac{125}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{117}{3} = 39.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, more generally, suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt &lt;/math&gt;
is to be calculated. Here, &lt;math&gt;f(t) = t^3 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F(t) = \frac{t^4}{4} &lt;/math&gt; can be used as the antiderivative. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt = \frac{d}{dx} F(x) - \frac{d}{dx} F(0) = \frac{d}{dx} \frac{x^4}{4} = x^3.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \int_0^x t^3\, dt = f(x) \frac{dx}{dx} - f(0) \frac{d0}{dx} = x^3.&lt;/math&gt;

As a theoretical example, the theorem can be used to prove that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_a^b f(x) dx=\int_a^c f(x) dx+\int_c^b f(x) dx.&lt;/math&gt; 

Since, 
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\int_a^b f(x) dx &amp;= F(b)-F(a), \\
\int_a^c f(x) dx &amp;=F(c)-F(a), \text{ and } \\
\int_c^b f(x) dx &amp;=F(b)-F(c), 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; 

the result follows from, 
:&lt;math&gt;F(b)-F(a)=F(c)-F(a)+F(b)-F(c).&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalizations==
We don't need to assume continuity of ''f'' on the whole interval.  Part I of the theorem then says: if ''f'' is any [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integrable]] function on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a number in {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} such that ''f'' is continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int_a^x f(t)\, dt&lt;/math&gt;

is differentiable for {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{nowrap|''F''â²(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) {{=}} ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;).}} We can relax the conditions on ''f'' still further and suppose that it is merely locally integrable.  In that case, we can conclude that the function ''F'' is differentiable [[almost everywhere]] and {{nowrap|''F''â²(''x'') {{=}} ''f''(''x'')}} almost everywhere. On the [[real line]] this statement is equivalent to [[Lebesgue differentiation theorem|Lebesgue's differentiation theorem]].  These results remain true for the HenstockâKurzweil integral, which allows a larger class of integrable functions {{harv|Bartle|2001|loc=Thm. 4.11}}.

In higher dimensions Lebesgue's differentiation theorem generalizes the Fundamental theorem of calculus by stating that for almost every ''x'', the average value of a function ''f'' over a ball of radius ''r'' centered at ''x'' tends to ''f''(''x'') as ''r'' tends to 0.

Part II of the theorem is true for any Lebesgue integrable function ''f'', which has an antiderivative ''F'' (not all integrable functions do, though).  In other words, if a real function ''F'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} admits a derivative ''f''(''x'') at ''every'' point ''x'' of {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} and if this derivative ''f'' is Lebesgue integrable on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''],}} then

:&lt;math&gt;F(b) - F(a) = \int_a^b f(t) \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rudin|1987|loc=th. 7.21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This result may fail for continuous functions ''F'' that admit a derivative ''f''(''x'') at almost every point ''x'', as the example of the [[Cantor function]] shows. However, if ''F'' is [[Absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]], it admits a derivative ''Fâ²''(''x'') at almost every point ''x'', and moreover ''Fâ²'' is integrable, with {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') â ''F''(''a'')}} equal to the integral of ''Fâ²'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}} Conversely, if ''f'' is any integrable function, then ''F'' as given in the first formula will be absolutely continuous with ''Fâ²'' = ''f'' a.e.

The conditions of this theorem may again be relaxed by considering the integrals involved as [[HenstockâKurzweil integral]]s.  Specifically, if a continuous function ''F''(''x'') admits a derivative ''f''(''x'') at all but countably many points, then ''f''(''x'') is HenstockâKurzweil integrable and {{nowrap|''F''(''b'') â ''F''(''a'')}} is equal to the integral of ''f'' on {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b''].}}  The difference here is that the integrability of ''f'' does not need to be assumed. {{harv|Bartle|2001|loc=Thm. 4.7}}

The version of [[Taylor's theorem]], which expresses the error term as an integral, can be seen as a generalization of the fundamental theorem.

There is a version of the theorem for [[complex number|complex]] functions: suppose ''U'' is an open set in '''C''' and {{nowrap|''f'' : ''U'' â '''C'''}} is a function that has a [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] antiderivative ''F'' on ''U''. Then for every curve {{nowrap|Î³ : [''a'', ''b''] â ''U'',}} the [[curve integral]] can be computed as

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma f(z) \,dz = F(\gamma(b)) - F(\gamma(a)).&lt;/math&gt;

The fundamental theorem can be generalized to curve and surface integrals in higher dimensions and on [[manifold]]s. One such generalization offered by the [[calculus of moving surfaces]] is the [[time evolution of integrals]]. The most familiar extensions of the fundamental theorem of calculus in higher dimensions are the [[divergence theorem]] and the [[gradient theorem]].

One of the most powerful generalizations in this direction is [[Stokes' theorem]] (sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of multivariable calculus):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_on_Manifolds_(book)|title=Calculus on Manifolds|last=Spivak|first=M.|publisher=W. A. Benjamin|year=1965|isbn=978-0-8053-9021-6|location=New York|pages=124â125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''M'' be an oriented [[piecewise]] [[Infinitely differentiable|smooth]] [[manifold]] of [[dimension]] ''n'' and let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be a smooth [[compactly supported]] [[differential form|(''n''â1)-form]] on ''M''. If â''M'' denotes the [[manifold|boundary]] of ''M'' given its induced [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''d'' is the [[exterior derivative]], which is defined using the manifold structure only.

The theorem is often used in situations where ''M'' is an embedded oriented submanifold of some bigger manifold (e.g. '''R'''''&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'') on which the form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37150">'''Gender and security sector reform''' is an emerging subfield of [[security sector governance and reform|security sector reform]] (SSR) that is both practical and conceptual. SSR generally is a comprehensive framework within which all or part of a state's [[security sector]] undergoes a process of transformation in order to bring it more into line with principles such as democratic oversight, [[good governance]] and the [[rule of law]].&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, ''The OECD DAC Handbook on Security System Reform (SSR): Supporting Security and Justice'' (Paris: OECD, 2007), p. 21. Available at http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/the-oecd-dac-handbook-on-security-system-reform_9789264027862-en (Gender and Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Sections added in 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The overall objectives of SSR programmes â as defined both by the state in question and any international donors supporting the process â tend to include improving service delivery, enhancing local ownership and ensuring the sustainability of security sector institutions.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; As [[gender]]-specific approaches take into account the specific needs of men, women, boys and girls through [[gender mainstreaming]] and by promoting the equal participation of people of all genders in decision-making processes, states and international organisations increasingly consider them to be a necessary component of SSR programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Academically, gender-specific approaches would also incorporate the needs of people identifying as other gender identities such as intersex, queer and trans as well as regionally specific identities like kathoey, Two-Spirit and hijra. However, this is rarely seen in current SSR practice at this time.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The need to integrate gender into SSR processes was recognised at the international level in 2008 by then-[[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations (UN) Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] in his report on SSR, where he stated that: "...the integration of a gender perspective in security sector reform is inherent to an inclusive and socially responsive approach to security. Gender-sensitive security sector reform", he went on, "is key to developing security sector institutions that are non-discriminatory, representative of the population and capable of effectively responding to the specific security needs of diverse groups."&lt;ref name ="UNSG Report"&gt;United Nations General Assembly and Security Council, ''Securing peace and development: the role of the United Nations in supporting security sector reform'', Report of the Secretary-General, 23 January 2008. UN Document No. [https://undocs.org/S/2008/39 A/62/659âS/2008/39]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of this report, the number of SSR programmes incorporating a gender dimension has increased dramatically, as has the amount of academic literature available and the number of specialists working in the area. Gender dimensions are often included in SSR processes as part of a country's commitment to [[UNSCR 1325|UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) (UNSCR 1325)]], which calls for wider female participation in all aspects of post-conflict reconstruction and for more consideration of the specific needs of women and girls.&lt;ref name="UNSCR 1325"&gt;United Nations Security Council, ''Resolution 1325 (2000)'', 31 October 2000, Document No. [https://undocs.org/S/RES/1325(2000) S/RES/1325 (2000)].&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Liberia's National Action Plan on [[UNSCR 1325]] makes provisions for strengthening the capacity of the SSR desk at the Ministry for Gender and Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ministry of Gender and Development|title=The Liberia National Action Plan for the implementation of United Nations Resolution 1325|year=2009|publisher=Government of Liberia|location=Monrovia|page=21|url=http://www.peacewomen.org/assets/file/NationalActionPlans/liberia_nationalactionplanmarch2009.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a decade after [[UNSCR 1325]] began to be implemented, the Security Council highlighted "the importance of addressing sexual violence in armed conflict and post-conflict situations in the context of security sector reform initiatives and arrangements, including training, vetting, and capacity-building of national security actors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=United Nations Security Council|title=Statement by the President of the Security Council |id=S/PRST/2012/3 |date=23 February 2012|url=https://undocs.org/S/PRST/2012/3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a US representative on the Security Council noted that the "integration of a gender perspective made institutions more inclusive and improved the overall effectiveness of security sector reform."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=United Nations Security Council|title=Effective, Professional, Accountable Security Sector at Cornerstone of Peace,  Sustainable Development, Security Council Stresses in Presidential Statement: Lessons Learned Could Become 'Lessons Lost', If Africa's Experience  With Security Sector Reform Not Utilized, Nigerian Foreign Minister Says in Debate|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10409.doc.htm|newspaper=UN Department of Public Information â¢ News and Media Division â¢ New York|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rationale==

===Effective service delivery===
One of the key tenets of SSR is that the security sector should be designed to serve the security and justice needs of the population. A person's gender (along with other characteristics, such as age, class, ethnicity/clan/tribe/caste, and sexual orientation) plays an important part in his or her own security needs. Worldwide, women, men, girls and boys have different experiences in areas such as sexual violence, trafficking in human beings, gang violence, robbery, dowry deaths, abduction and so-called 'honour killings'. For example, over 90 percent of deaths related to firearms are male,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Health Organization|title=Small Arms and Global Health: WHO Contribution to the UN Conference on Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, July 9â20, 2001|year=2001|publisher=WHO|location=Geneva|pages=3|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_NMH_VIP_01.1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in most countries, the proportion of women with male intimate partners who experience physical violence during the course of their relationship lies between one-quarter and one-half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garcia-Morena|first=Claudia|title=WHO Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women|year=2005|publisher=WHO|location=Geneva|pages=xii|url=http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/Introduction-Chapter1-Chapter2.pdf |author2=Henrica A.F.M. Jansen |author3=Mary Ellsberg |author4=Lori Heise |author5=Charlotte Watts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world, women, men, girls and boys also have different access to resources such as land, money, education, healthcare and political power. Women own less than 15 percent of land worldwide and only 2 percent in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Global Compact|title=Snapshot of Women Worldwide: Facts and Figures|publisher=UN|url=http://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/issues_doc/human_rights/Meetings_x_events/05Mar2009_PPT_Snapshot_Facts_and_Figures.pdf|date=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, gender perspectives are a useful tool to achieving the security sector's objectives. For example, in order to encourage women who have been victims of SGBV to report the crime, it may be important to give them the option of speaking to a woman police officer, perhaps in a specialized police station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unifem.org/attachments/gender_issues/women_war_peace/CaseStudiesOfGenderSensitivePoliceReformInRwandaAndTimorLeste_2009.pdf, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where men are affected by SGBV, similar provisions may also be needed, as well as training for security sector personnel who may not be aware of the existence and extent of gender-based violence committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Storr|first=Will|title=The rape of men|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/17/the-rape-of-men|newspaper=The Observer|date=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, an effective response will usually also involve public awareness campaigns highlighting the problem and the services available to survivors. It will probably also include forming partnerships between security providers (e.g. police, justice institutions and prisons), health care providers and civil society organisations, as part of a holistic approach to SSR.

More broadly, collaboration between security sector institutions and civil society groups involved in gender issues can increase the effectiveness of the security sector. Such groups can deliver training, support policy development, and on an ongoing basis provide complementary security and justice services and keep security forces informed about issues within communities.

A further gendered aspect of effective service delivery centres around the skills of security sector personnel themselves. Other societal factors tend to result in men and women having different skill sets. Consequently, if security sector institutions lack either male and female staff at any level, their staff will possess a smaller skill set, limiting their operational options. For example, studies in the USA found that American female police officers were more adept at policing without the use of excessive or deadly force than their male counterparts, although they were as likely to use force as men when absolutely necessary. As a result, male police officers cost US taxpayers between 2.5 and 5.5 times more in legal fees related to excessive force liability lawsuit payouts and are almost three times more likely to be threatened or attacked by citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lonsway|first=Dr. Kim |author2=Margaret Moore |author3=Chief Penny Harrington |author4=Eleanor Smeal |author5=Katherine Spillar|title=Hiring &amp; Retaining More Women: The Advantages to Law Enforcement Agencies|journal=National Center for Women &amp; Policing: a division of the Feminist Majority Foundation|date=Spring 2003|pages=4, 7|url=http://womenandpolicing.com/pdf/NewAdvantagesReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the proven ability of women to increase the skill set of police forces, the closest any police force has come to achieving gender balance is Estonia, where 33.5% of officers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Resetnikova|first=Aigi|title=Women in Policing in a Transforming Organization : The Case of The Estonian Police|journal=The Journal of Power Institutions in Post-Soviet Societies|year=2006|volume=4/5|url=http://pipss.revues.org/502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourthly, certain security roles might for cultural reasons only be able to be performed by personnel of a particular gender, requiring both male and female personnel for effective operations. For example, in many cultures it is inappropriate for a male police officer or soldier to search a woman. Likewise, in intelligence-gathering, civilians may only be willing to speak with security sector personnel of a certain gender.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender and Security Sector Reform Toolkit|last=Valasek|first=Kristin|publisher=DCAF, OSCE/ODIHR, UN-INSTRAW|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Bastick|editor-first=Megan|series=|place=Geneva|pages=|chapter=Security Sector Reform and Gender|author-link=|editor2-last=Valasek|editor2-first=Kristin|chapterurl=http://www.osce.org/odihr/30655?download=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local ownership===
Local ownership has been recognised as a key pillar in ensuring that SSR is both implemented correctly and sustainable. Local ownership of SSR is characterised by "the reform of security policies, institutions and activities in a given country must be designed, managed and implemented by local actors rather than external actors" and is notably distinct from local support for donor programmes and projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nathan|first=Laurie|title=No ownership, no commitment : a guide to local ownership of security sector reform|year=2007|publisher=University of Birmingham|location=Birmingham|isbn=9780704425644|pages=4|url=http://www.ssrnetwork.net/documents/Publications/No_Ownership_No_Commitment_v2.pdf|edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that security and justice needs vary by gender, it is important to ensure that people of different genders are consulted and involved in an SSR process. In practice, this can be achieved by involving women's groups, youth groups and other organisations that work on gender-related security issues such as human trafficking, gang violence and human rights. Such groups can serve as a crucial bridge between local communities and SSR policymakers, strengthening local ownership through communicating security and justice needs to policymakers and raising awareness of SSR in local communities.

===Oversight and accountability===
Improving oversight and accountability of the security sector can ensure the sustainability of SSR by building trust among the population and by deterring security sector personnel from abusing their power.&lt;ref&gt;For further details, see {{cite book|last=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]|title=OECD Handbook on Security System Reform|year=2008|publisher=OECD DAC|location=Paris|isbn=9789264022287|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/the-oecd-dac-handbook-on-security-system-reform_9789264027862-en|chapter=Section 7.1: Democratic Oversight and Accountability|edition=2011 Update|pages=112â123}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be effective, it is essential that security sector oversight bodies  and accountability mechanisms (parliaments, national human rights institutions, complaints bodies, local security fora etc.) adopt a gendered perspective. This involves both giving particular attention to the different types of violations committed by security sector personnel against people of different genders, and monitoring the quality of services delivered to people of different genders. Involving gender experts, women's groups and other civil society organisations that work on gender issues in oversight bodies and accountability processes is helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]|title=OECD Handbook on Security System Reform|year=2008|publisher=OECD DAC|location=Paris|isbn=9789264022287|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/the-oecd-dac-handbook-on-security-system-reform_9789264027862-en|edition=2011 Update|page=5|chapter=Section 9: Integrating gender awareness and equality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International frameworks==
Gender and SSR at both national and international levels takes place within a well-elaborated legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;For a near-complete list of international and regional legal instruments, see {{Citation | editor-last = Bastick | editor-first = Megan

===Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) (1979)===

[[CEDAW]] holds states responsible for ending discrimination against women, which it defines in Article 1 as "any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field." States parties agree to do this using measures such as reviewing their national legislation to remove discriminatory laws and to criminalize discrimination against women, creating national tribunals or institutions to eliminate discrimination or by implementing policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995)===

The [[Beijing Declaration]] and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Platform for Action]] resulted from the [[Fourth World Conference on Women]] and aimed to promote the advancement and empowerment of women. Areas related to SSR include calls on governments to ensure access to free or low-cost legal services, to aim for gender balance in nominations to international, judicial and governmental bodies and to develop comprehensive human rights education programmes for the public, public officials (notably within the police, military, prison system, government, judiciary and all those working in positions related to migration).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 1325 on Women Peace and Security (2000)===

[[UNSCR 1325]] was a landmark resolution in that it recognised the disproportionate impact of armed conflict on civilian women and children, whether they are targeted (e.g. rape as an instrument of war) or indirectly affected (e.g. forced migration). It also recognised contributions women make to conflict prevention, resolution and post-conflict reconstruction and called for greater inclusion of women in processes related to peace and security. It mandated a policy of gender mainstreaming in all UN peacekeeping operations, which often include support to SSR processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peacewomen.org/themes_page.php?id=15&amp;subtheme=true&amp;adhoc=88&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 1820 (2008)===

[[UNSCR 1820]] sought to address the issue of sexual violence against women and girls during conflict by explicitly mandating the participation of women in "all disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration processes, and in justice and security sector reform efforts assisted by the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/S/RES/1820(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCRs 1888 and 1889 (2009)===

[[UNSCR 1888]] builds on 1820 by mandating that sexual violence also be addressed in peace processes and calls for the deployment of experts and a Special Representative of Sexual Violence in Conflict. [[UNSCR 1889]] calls for an increased role for women at the top levels of mediation as well as mandating the UN to collect gender-segregated data on all activities related to peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inclusivesecurity.org/publication/guide-to-un-security-council-resolutions-on-women-peace-and-security/&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 1960 (2010)===

[[UNSCR 1960]] encourages the inclusion of women in police, civil and military functions during peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.makeeverywomancount.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1369:united-nations-security-council-resolution-1960-unscr-1960-&amp;catid=51:handouts-a-guides&amp;Itemid=154&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNSCR 2106 (2013)===
[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2106|UNSCR 2106]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; requests relevant UN entities to assist national authorities in addressing sexual violence, with effective participation of women, in SSR and justice sector reform processes, specifically through training, increasing female recruitment and implementing vetting processes that exclude perpetrators of sexual violence from serving in security institutions.&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/S/RES/2106(2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods and strategies==
The following two complementary strategies can be used to integrate gender issues into SSR policy and programming:

===Gender mainstreaming===
[[Gender mainstreaming]] is "the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, economic and societal spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated. The ultimate goal is to achieve [[gender equality]]."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. "[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/52/plenary/a52-3.htm Report of the Economic and Social Council for 1997]". A/52/3.18 September 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of SSR, gender mainstreaming involves considering the impact all aspects of the programme at all stages of the programming cycle in light of the different security needs of women, men, boys and girls. To achieve this, all data collected should be gender disaggregated. It may result in gender initiatives â such as gender training for security sector personnel and gender budget analysis to ensure that resources are being distributed equally: It may also result in initiatives aimed at men, women, boys or girls&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; â such as mentoring schemes to facilitate the professional development of female police officers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carson|first=David|author-link=|date=November 2009|title=Mentoring For Women in Policing in the UK|url=http://business.brookes.ac.uk/commercial/work/iccld/ijebcm/documents/special3-paper-05.pdf|journal=International Journal of Evidence Based Coaching and Mentoring|volume=Special Issue No.3|pages=51â63|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing access to justice for male civilian victims of wartime sex-selective massacres,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first1=R.

===Promoting the equal participation of men and women===
Sometimes known as gender balance, promoting the equal participation of men and women in SSR processes and security sector institutions is a method of strengthening local ownership as well as increasing representation and effectiveness. In relation to SSR processes, this may involve ensuring that women and men are equally involved in SSR needs assessment, monitoring and evaluation, and that representatives of women (such as from the ministry responsible for women, or from civil society) participate in SSR policy- and decision-making. In relation to security sector institutions, because men are over-represented, promoting equal participation generally involves increasing the recruitment, retention and advancement of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=D.|title=Gender Advisor to COM KFOR|url=http://www.nato.int/kfor/chronicle/2012/chronicle_09/chronicle_09.pdf|newspaper=KFOR Chronicle|date=September 2012}} There are, however, some areas where numbers of men need to be increased. For example, NATO Gender Advisor Major Elisabeth Schleicher recruited NATO's first male Gender Focal Point, CPT Andy Young, and claims that this has enhanced the effectiveness of the gender unit.&lt;/ref&gt; Doing so may require developing policies for security sector institutions that allow personnel to perform socially-expected gender roles (e.g. flexible working hours for parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some countries have attempted to promote equal participation by introducing gender quotas. In the Liberian National Police, for example, a quota that at least 20% of new recruits must be women succeeded in rapidly increasing female participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Country contexts==
While all gender and SSR processes share many overarching objectives, the kinds of activities carried out on the ground will vary significantly depending upon the context in which they take place.

===Post-conflict countries===
The focus of many gender and SSR efforts in post-conflict settings is on stemming heightened levels of SGBV, particularly against women and children, that tend to persist due to high levels of available weapons, trauma and a lack of economic opportunities for former-combatants and young adults (especially men) who feel marginalised. Men, women, girls and boys all have important roles to play in re-establishing civil society. However, as there is often pressure to rebuild security sector institutions as quickly as possible and as male-dominated, militarised command structures may still be in political control of the state, the different needs of the population are often overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastick|first=Megan|title=Integrating Gender in Post-Conflict Security Sector Reform|journal=DCAF Policy Papers|year=2008|issue=29|pages=4â5|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/Publications/Integrating-Gender-in-Post-Conflict-Security-Sector-Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges in these settings frequently include integrating gender issues in DDR processes, recruiting more women into newly reconstructed security sector institutions, ensuring access to transitional justice mechanisms for victims of SGBV during the conflict and ensuring that the newly reformed justice institutions take into account the needs of those most at risk from the heightened levels of post-conflict SGBV. However, it should also be emphasised that SSR can be an entry point in post-conflict contexts for overcoming pre-conflict gender-based inequality and insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastick|first=Megan|title=Integrating Gender in Post-Conflict Security Sector Reform|journal=DCAF Policy Papers|year=2008|issue=29|pages=16â20|url=http://www.dcaf.ch/Publications/Integrating-Gender-in-Post-Conflict-Security-Sector-Reform}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transitional countries===
Transitional countries refer to post-authoritarian contexts which may or may not be accompanied be changes in economic system. They tend to have well-funded and oversized security institutions that are undergoing a shift from serving a regime to serving the population. As such, developing and implementing new working practices whereby the primary objective is to respond to the different security needs of the population may present a challenge for personnel who are used to maintaining order through violent means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Future of Security Sector Reform|year=2010|publisher=The Centre for International Governance Innovation|location=Waterloo, Ont.|pages=183â186.|author=Alice Hills|editor=Mark Sedra|chapter=Learning the Hard Way: Implementing SSR in Africa's Post-Authoritarian States}}&lt;/ref&gt; In former [[Eastern Bloc]] transitional countries, civil society may be weak but in other contexts such as in countries affected by the [[Arab Spring]], civil society may have organised into a broad coalition in order to bring about political change with women's groups playing a leading role. There often is a window of opportunity for civil society to reshape security sector institutions by, for example, integrating gender perspectives. This may also be incentivised by new possibilities for regional cooperation which involve adhering to gender-related minimum standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Developing countries===
There is increasing opinion that gender-based violence and discrimination inhibit development as, aside from their negative social and personal consequences, they impair the productivity of those affected to the detriment of the whole economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morrison|first=Andrew R.|title=The costs and impacts of gender-based violence in developing countries: Methodological considerations and new evidence|date=November 2004|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/costsandimpactsofgbv.pdf|author2=Maria Beatriz Orlando}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UN Women|title=Gender-Based Violence and the Workplace: Report of the Expert Group Meeting|date=12â13 December 2011|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/osagi/ianwge2012/Executive-Summary-EGM-GBV-Workplace-Feb-21.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gender-based violence and discrimination also increases the risk of violent conflict breaking out as it can be used as an instrument of warfare to destabilise communities, can inhibit certain groups from participating in post-conflict peacebuilding activities as well as perpetuating an atmosphere of impunity regarding violence in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barr|first=Corey|title=Making Connections: Bridging Transitional Justice and Security Sector Reform to Confront Conflict-Related Sexual and Gender-Based Violence|journal=[[PRAXIS: The Fletcher Journal of Human Security]]|year=2011|volume= XXVI|pages=6, 8, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, gender and SSR is increasingly being implemented by the governments of developing countries with the support of donors and other actors in the international community, who may make the integration of gender a condition for development support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oelke|first=Sandra|title=Security Sector Reform and Gender: Concept and Points of Entry for Development Cooperation|year=2007|publisher=Deutsche Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) GmbH|location=Eschborn|pages=7|url=http://www2.gtz.de/dokumente/bib/07-0738.pdf}} Translated by Katherine Clark. See also UN Millennium Development Goal 3, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/gender.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Translating policy into practice is often hindered by the lack of human and financial resources in developing counties. However, civil society organisations are widespread and well-organised in many developing countries providing competent partners for governments and donors in implementing gender and SSR initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mobekk|first=Eirin|title=Gender, Women and Security Sector Reform|journal=International Peacekeeping|date=23 April 2010|volume=17|issue=2|pages=284, 288â9|doi=10.1080/13533311003625142|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13533311003625142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developed countries===
The term SSR is usually used to refer to processes in post-conflict and transitional countries, where there is often support by third countries and/or international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Concept for European Community Support for Security Sector Reform refers to it as EU "external action"; it does not include justice reform activities in member-states such as Romania and Bulgaria within the scope of its SSR activities. See {{cite journal|last=Commission of the European Communities|title=A Concept for European Community Support for Security Sector Reform|journal=Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament|date=24 May 2006|issue={SEC(2006) 658}|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/com/2006/com2006_0253en01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, developed countries also engage in SSR activities. Gender and SSR-related activities include efforts to increase the recruitment, retention and advancement of female security sector personnel, improving responses to SGBV, training on how to prevent and respond to SGBV during overseas deployments, strengthening the gender dimensions of oversight and monitoring, and building collaboration with civil society groups concerned with gender issues. The challenges for integrating gender in such contexts tend to revolve around complacency and the emphasis on external threats such as terrorism. Entry points for gender and SSR are often linked to legal obligations under anti-discrimination and human rights legislation, or the need to boost recruitment for operational reasons. For example, following the introduction of the Canadian Human Rights Act (1977), the Canadian Forces were obliged to prove that any discriminatory policies were an operational necessity. After consistently failing to do so in court, the systemic barriers to women's participation in all areas of activity had been lifted by 2001. Social pressure also forced the Canadian Forces to address attitudinal causes of discrimination and SGBV through the establishment of Defense Diversity Councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winslow|first=Donna|author2=Jason Dunn|title=Women in the Canadian Forces: Between legal and social integration|journal=Current Sociology|year=2002|volume=50|issue=5|pages=642, 661â2|doi=10.1177/0011392102050005003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, regional frameworks such as NATO and the Council of Europe can provide impetus and a degree of social pressure for gender and SSR activities in developing countries.

[[Jewish history|Jewish communities]] have existed across the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] since [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]]. By the time of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, these ancient communities had been ruled by various empires and included the [[Babylonian Jews|Babylonian]], [[Persian Jews|Persian]], [[Jews in Carthage|Carthaginian]], [[Hellenistic Jews|Greek]], [[Roman Jews|Roman]], [[Byzantine Jews|Byzantine]], [[Old Yishuv|Ottoman]] and [[Yemenite Jews]].

[[IslamicâJewish relations|Jews under Islamic rule]] were given the status of [[dhimmi]], along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Though [[second-class citizen]]s, these non-Muslim groups were nevertheless accorded certain rights and protections as "[[people of the book]]". During [[Jews in the Middle Ages|waves of persecution in Medieval Europe]], many [[Jewish refugees|Jews found refuge]] in Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] were invited to settle in various parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they would often form a prosperous [[model minority]] of merchants [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire|acting as intermediaries for their Muslim rulers]].

Today, Jews residing in [[Muslim countries]] have been [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|reduced to a small fraction]] of their [[Historical Jewish population comparisons|former sizes]], with [[Jews in Iran|Iran]] and [[Jews in Turkey|Turkey]] being home to the largest remaining Jewish populations.

==Middle Ages==

===Muslim conquests===
{{main|History of the Jews in the Arabian Peninsula}}
There were, for a long but uncertain period, a significant number of Jews in [[Arabia]]. Historians claim that very large numbers of Jews â as many as 80,000 â arrived after the destruction of the [[First Temple]], to join others already long-established in places such as the oasis of [[Khaybar]] as well as the trading colonies in [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]] (where they had their own [[cemetery]]). Another theory posits that these Jews were refugees from [[Byzantine]] persecutions. Arab historians mention some 20 Jewish communities, including two of [[Kohanim]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003), p. XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], written shortly after [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]], addressed some points regarding the civil and religious situation for the Jewish communities living within the city from an Islamic perspective. For example, the constitution stated that the Jews "will profess their religion, and the Muslims theirs", and they "shall be responsible for their expenditure, and the Muslims for theirs". After the [[Battle of Badr]], the Jewish tribe of [[Banu Qaynuqa]] breached treaties and agreements with Muhammad. Muhammad regarded this as [[casus belli]] and besieged the [[Banu Qaynuqa]]. Upon surrender the tribe was expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The following year saw the expulsion of the second tribe, the [[Banu Nadir]], accused of planning to kill the prophet Muhammad. The third major Jewish tribe in Medina, [[Banu Qurayza]] was eliminated after  betraying the Muslims during the [[Battle of the Trench]]. However, there were many Jewish communities in Medina who continued to live in Medina peacefully after these events such as [[Banu Awf]], [[Banu Harith]], [[Banu Jusham]] [[Banu Alfageer]], [[Banu Najjar]], [[Banu Sa'ida]], and [[Banu Shutayba]].&lt;ref&gt;Stillman ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irvin and Sunquist, ''History of the World Christian Movement'', Vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 2001), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

In year 20 of the Muslim era, or the year 641 AD, Muhammad's successor the Caliph [[Umar]] decreed that Jews and Christians should be removed from all but the southern and eastern fringes of Arabiaâa decree based on the uttering of the Prophet: "Let there not be two religions in Arabia". The two populations in question were the Jews of the [[Khaybar]] oasis in the north and the Christians of [[Najran]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003) p. XXVII&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''The Crisis of Islam'' (London, 2003), p. XXVIII&lt;/ref&gt; Only the Red Sea port of [[Jeddah]] was permitted as a "religious quarantine area" and continued to have a small complement of Jewish merchants.

===During the Caliphates===
[[Image:Al-andalus_229.png|thumb|A Jew and a Muslim playing chess in 13th century [[al-Andalus]].]]

During the [[Middle Ages]], Jewish people under Muslim rule experienced tolerance and integration.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"&gt;Cohen, Mark R. "[https://www.academia.edu/6560487/Neo_lachrymose_Conception_of_Jewish-Arab_History The Neo-Lachrymose Conception of Jewish-Arab History]." ''Tikkun'' 6.3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}} Some historians refer to this time period as the "Golden Age" for the Jews, as more opportunities became available to them.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt; In the context of day-to-day life, Abdel Fattah Ashour, a professor of medieval history at Cairo University, states that Jewish people found solace under Islamic rule during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}} The Muslim rule at times didn't fully enforce the [[Pact of Umar]] and the traditional [[Dhimmi]] status of Jews; i.e., the Jews sometimes, as in eleventh-century [[Granada]], were not second-class citizens. Author Merlin Swartz referred to this time period as a new era for the Jews, stating that the attitude of tolerance led to Jewish integration into Arab-Islamic society.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Social integration allowed Jews to make great advances in new fields, including mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, chemistry and philology,&lt;ref&gt;Cowling (2005), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; with some even gaining political power under Islamic rule.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|55}} For example, the [[vizier]] of [[Baghdad]] entrusted his capital to Jewish bankers, Jews were put in charge of certain parts of maritime and slave trade, and [[Siraf]], the principal port of the caliphate in the 10th century, had a Jewish governor.&lt;ref&gt;Poliakov (1974), pg.68-71&lt;/ref&gt; Increased commercial freedom increased their integration into the Arab marketplace.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} [[Leon Poliakov]] writes that in the early ages of Islam, Jews enjoyed great privileges, and their communities prospered. No laws or social barriers restricted their commercial activities, and exclusive trade and craft guilds like those in Europe did not exist. Jews who moved to Muslim lands found themselves free to engage in any profession, resulting in less stigma than in Europe where such restrictions were still in force.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} This, coupled with more intense Christian persecution, encouraged many Jews to migrate to areas newly conquered by Muslims and establish communities there.

Although Jewish life improved under Islamic rule, an interfaith utopia did not exist.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}}  Jews still experienced persecution. Under Islamic Rule, the [[Pact of Umar]] was introduced, which protected the Jews but also established them as inferior.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|59}} Since the 11th century, there have been instances of [[pogrom]]s against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/Jews_in_Arab_lands_(gen).html The Treatment of Jews in Arab/Islamic Countries]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[1066 Granada massacre]], the razing of the entire Jewish quarter in the [[Al-Andalus|Andalucian]] city of [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&amp;letter=G&amp;search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North Africa]], there were cases of violence against Jews in the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/morocjews.html|title=The Jews of Morocco}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other Arab lands including [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/egjews.html|title=The Jews of Egypt|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/syrianjews.html|title=The Jews of Syria|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yemen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/yemenjews.html|title=The Jews of Yemen|work=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 15th century, the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] Jewish population was confined to segregated quarters known as [[mellah]]s. In cities, these were surrounded by walls and a [[fortified gateway]]. Rural ''mellahs'', however, were separate villages inhabited solely by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/publication/lm/017/morocco.html The Jews of Morocco, by Ralph G. Bennett]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Almohad]]s, who had taken control of much of Islamic Iberia by 1172, were far more fundamentalist in outlook than the [[Almoravides]], and they treated the ''dhimmis'' harshly. Jews and Christians were expelled from [[Morocco]] and [[Islamic Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 The Forgotten Refugees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051923/http://www.theforgottenrefugees.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66&amp;Itemid=39 |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the choice of either death or conversion, some Jews, such as the family of [[Maimonides]], fled south and east to more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html Sephardim], ''Jewish Virtual Library'', Rebecca Weiner&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, Joel L., ''Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait'' in ''The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides'' pp. 16-17 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1465, Arab mobs in [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] slaughtered thousands of Jews, leaving only 11 alive, after a Jewish deputy vizier treated a Muslim woman in an offensive manner. The killings touched off a wave of similar massacres throughout [[Morocco]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerber (1986), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsje.org/Jews%20Kicked%20out%20of%20Arab%20Lands%20Part%202.htm Jews kicked out of Arab Countries Part 2: The Persecution of Jews prior to 1948], Historical Society of Jews from Egypt&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Mark R. Cohen proposes a comparative approach to understanding Jewish life under Islamic rule, noting that Jews in Islamic lands often experienced less physical violence than Jews under Western Christendom.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} He posits that Muslims considered Jews less theologically threatening than Christians did, suggesting that the Christians wanted to establish a separate religious identity from Judaism, from which their faith split and diverged.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|58}} According to him, instances of persecution were occasional, more the exception than the rule,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|59}} and claims of systemic persecution at the hands of Muslim rulers are myths created to bolster political propaganda.&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"/&gt;{{rp|56}} {{dubious|date=April 2017}} The situation where Jews in the Muslim world both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted there at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Von Grunebaum, ''Eastern Jewry Under Islam'', 1971, p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Seljuk Empire (1077-1307) and early Ottoman rule===
{{main|History of the Jews in Turkey}}
Jews have lived in [[Asia Minor]] for more than 2,400 years. Originally settling in Asia Minor in the Hellenistic era, they were expelled by Byzantines between the 5th and 11th centuries{{fact|date=November 2018}}, resettling there only after the conquest of much of Anatolia by Muslim [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] forces after the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. Jewish communities grew and thrived under the Seljuks, and later also under Ottoman rule, making it a safe haven for Jews fleeing from persecution elsewhere.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Early Modern Period==

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Ottoman Empire]] served as a [[refugees|refuge]] for [[History of the Jews in Spain#Number of the exiles|Jewish refugees]] from [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish empire]], especially after the fall of Muslim Spain in 1492 and [[Alhambra decree|Edict of Expulsion]]. This continued through the [[Roman Catholic]] [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], as secret Jews and [[Marranos|forced converts]] continued to flee Spain. The [[Maghreb]] from North Africa similarly found refuge among the Ottomans, as large Arabian cities created their own restrictive Jewish quarters (''[[Mellah]]s'').

[[Image:Jews in Jerusalem 1890s.jpg|thumb|[[Photochrom]] of Jews in Jerusalem, in the 1890s.]]
In 1834, in [[Safed]], [[Ottoman Syria]], local Muslim Arabs carried out a massacre of the [[Old Yishuv|Jewish population]] known as the [[Safed Plunder]].&lt;ref name=bloch&gt;Bloch, Abraham P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mjxJAFawRasC&amp;pg=PA168 One a day: an anthology of Jewish historical anniversaries], 1987. pg. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelstein1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Finkelstein|title=The Jews: their history, culture, and religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-QDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=17 February 2012|year=1960|publisher=Harper|page=679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1840, the [[History of the Jews in Syria|Jews of Damascus]] were falsely accused of having murdered a Christian monk and his Muslim servant and of having [[blood libel|used their blood]] to bake [[Matzo|Passover bread]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/reaction.html Americans React to Damascus Blood Libel]&lt;/ref&gt; A Jewish barber was tortured until he "confessed"; two other Jews who were arrested died under torture, while a third converted to Islam to save his life. Throughout the 1860s, the [[History of the Jews in Libya|Jews of Libya]] were subjected to what Gilbert calls punitive taxation. In 1864, around 500 Jews were killed in [[Marrakech]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fez]] in [[Morocco]]. In 1869, 18 Jews were killed in [[Tunis]], and an Arab mob on [[Djerba|Jerba Island]] looted and burned Jewish homes, stores, and synagogues. In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight. In 1897, synagogues were ransacked and Jews were murdered in [[Tripolitania]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert179/&gt;

====Kurdistan====
{{main|Kurdish Jews}}
Jews lived in [[Kurdistan]] for thousands of years, before the final and mass migration in 1951-1952 to Israel. The Jews lived under the Ottoman Empire and under the Persian Empire for many years and following World War I, they lived mainly in Iraq, Iran and Turkey, some lived in Syria. Jews lived in many Kurdish urban centers such as Aqra, Dohuk, Arbil, Zakho, Sulaimaniya, Amadia, in Southern Kurdistan, in Saqiz, Bana and Ushno, in Eastern Kurdistan, in Jezira, Nisebin, Mardin and DiyarbakÄ±r in Turkey and in Qamishle in North-Western Syria. Jews lived as well in hundreds of villages in the rural and tribal area of Kurdistan, usually one or two families in a village, where they worked as weavers of traditional Kurdish clothing or as tenants of the ''agha'', the landlord or head of the village.

===Persia===
{{main|Persian Jews|History of the Jews in Iran}}
In 1656, all Jews were expelled from [[Isfahan]] and [[forced to convert to Islam]] because of a common belief that their Jewishness was impure. However, as it became known that the converts continued to practice [[Judaism]] in secret and because the treasury suffered from the loss of ''jizya'' collected from the Jews, in 1661 they were allowed to revert to Judaism, although they were still required to wear a distinctive patch on their clothing.&lt;ref name="littman1"&gt;Littman (1979), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of [[Meshed]], a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]]. The Jews themselves were violently forced to convert, narrowly avoiding complete massacre.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179-182.&lt;/ref&gt; There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867.&lt;ref name="littman2"&gt;Littman (1979), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), p. 168..&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- was: &lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;; this is no longer valid but may be in the history --&gt; In 1839, the [[Allahdad incident]], the Jews of [[Mashhad]], [[Iran]], now known as the Mashhadi Jews, were [[anusim|coerced into converting]] to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Hadassah"&gt;{{cite web  |year=2003  |title=Mashhadi Jews in New-York  |url=http://dangoor.com/issue76/articles/76014.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote of [[Persian Jews]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"â¦they are obliged to live in a separate part of townâ¦; for they are considered as unclean creaturesâ¦  Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirtâ¦  For the same reason, they are prohibited to go out when it rains; for it is said the rain would wash dirt off them, which would sully the feet of the Mussulmansâ¦  If a Jew is recognized as such in the streets, he is subjected to the greatest insults.  The passers-by spit in his face, and sometimes beat himâ¦ unmercifullyâ¦  If a Jew enters a shop for anything, he is forbidden to inspect the goodsâ¦ Should his hand incautiously touch the goods, he must take them at any price the seller chooses to ask for them... Sometimes the Persians intrude into the dwellings of the Jews and take possession of whatever please them. Should the owner make the least opposition in defense of his property, he incurs the danger of atoning for it with his life... If... a Jew shows himself in the street during the three days of the Katel (Muharram)â¦, he is sure to be murdered."''&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1984), pp. 181â183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bukhara===
A number of groups of [[Persian Jews]] have split off since ancient times, to the extent that they are now recognized as separate communities, such as the [[Bukharian Jews]] and [[Mountain Jew]]s.

Confined to [[ghetto|city quarters]], the [[Bukharan Jews]] were denied basic rights and many were forced to [[Chala (Jews)|convert]] to Islam. They had to wear black and yellow dress to distinguish themselves from the Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Bukharan_Jews.html Bukharan Jews], Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}

===Zaydi Yemen===

Under the [[Zaydi]] rule, discriminatory laws became more severe against the [[Yemenite Jews]], which culminated in their eventual exile, in what later became known as the [[Exile of Mawza]]. They were considered to be impure, and therefore forbidden to touch a Muslim or a Muslim's food. They were obligated to humble themselves before a Muslim, to walk to the left side, and greet him first. They could not build houses higher than a Muslim's or ride a camel or horse, and when riding on a mule or a donkey, they had to sit sideways. Upon entering the Muslim quarter a Jew had to take off his foot-gear and walk barefoot. If attacked with stones or fists by Islamic youth, a Jew was not allowed to defend himself. In such situations he had the option of fleeing or seeking intervention by a merciful Muslim passerby.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Communities in Exotic Places," by Ken Blady, [[Jason Aronson]] Inc., 2000, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-colonial era==

===Arab League===
{{further| Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
By the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|had left, fled or had been expelled]] from Arab and Muslim-majority  countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States.&lt;ref name=Shenhav&gt;[[Yehouda Shenhav]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=k7FoMi-qY4kC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and Ethnicity]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.&lt;ref name=Shenhav/&gt; In 1945, there were between 758,000 and 866,000 Jews living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,000. In some Arab states, such as [[Libya]], which once had a Jewish population of around 3 percent, similar to that of the [[American Jews|United States]] today), the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

The largest communities of Jews in Muslim countries exist in the non-Arab countries of [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]; both, however, are much smaller than they historically have been. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in [[Morocco]] with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia with about 1,000.

===Imperial Iran and Islamic Republic===
Judaism is the second-oldest religion still existing in Iran after [[Zoroastrianism]]. By various estimates, between 8,000 and 10,000 Jews remain in [[Iran]], mostly in [[Tehran]] and [[Hamedan]]. About one-third of the some 120,000-150,000 Iranian Jews in the mid-20th century fled the country during the 1950s, as a consequence of political instability. Most of the remaining 80,000-100,000 Jews fled during and following the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Today, the largest groups of Persian Jews are found in [[Israel]] (236,000-360,000 in 2014, including second-generation Israelis) and the [[United States]] (45,000, especially in the [[Los Angeles]] area, home to a large concentration of [[expatriate]] Iranians). There are also smaller communities in Western Europe.

The '''Holdridge life zones system''' is a global bioclimatic scheme for the classification of land areas. It was first published by [[Leslie Holdridge]] in 1947, and updated in 1967. It is a relatively simple system based on few empirical data, giving objective mapping criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/publications/abstracts/archived/lugo.htm Western Ecology Division | US EPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EN4ZYhX6?url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/publications/abstracts/archived/lugo.htm |date=2013-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic assumption of the system is that both [[soil type|soil]] and [[climax vegetation]] can be mapped once climate is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comments on the Application of the Holdridge System for Classification of World Life Zones as Applied to Costa Rica |author=Harris SA |journal=Arctic and Alpine Research |volume=5 |year=1973 |pages=A187âA191 |jstor=1550169 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheme==
While it was first designed for tropical and subtropical areas, the system applies globally. The system has been shown to fit [[tropical]] vegetation zones, [[Mediterranean]] zones, and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] zones, but is less applicable to cold oceanic or cold arid climates where moisture becomes the determining factor. The system has found a major use in assessing the possible changes in natural vegetation patterns due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ecosys/cdroms/ged_iia/datasets/a06/reprints/lh1.htm |title=Possible Changes in Natural Vegetation Patterns Due to a Global Warming |last=Leemans |first=Rik |year=1990 |publisher=National Geophysical Data Center (NOAA) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016000404/http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ecosys/cdroms/ged_iia/datasets/a06/reprints/lh1.htm |archivedate=2009-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three axes of the [[barycentric subdivision]]s are:
* [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (annual, logarithmic)
* biotemperature (mean annual, logarithmic)
* [[potential evapotranspiration]] ratio  (PET) to mean total annual precipitation.

Further indicators incorporated into the system are:
* [[humidity]] provinces
* [[Latitudinal|latitudinal regions]]
* [[Altitudinal zonation|altitudinal belts]]

Biotemperature is based on the growing season length and temperature. It is measured as the mean of all temperatures above freezing, with all temperatures below freezing and above 30&amp;nbsp;Â°C adjusted to 0&amp;nbsp;Â°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lugo|first1=A.

Holdridge's system uses biotemperature first, rather than the temperate latitude bias of [[Clinton Hart Merriam|Merriam]]'s life zones, and does not primarily consider elevation. The system is considered more appropriate to the complexities of [[tropical vegetation]] than Merriam's system.

== Scientific relationship between the 3 axes and 3 indicators ==
[[Potential evapotranspiration]] (PET) is the amount of water that would be evaporated and transpired if there were sufficient [[water]] available. High temperatures result in higher PET. [[Evapotranspiration]] (ET) is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the Earth's land surface to atmosphere. Evapotranspiration can never be greater than PET. The ratio, Precipitation/PET, is the [[aridity index]] (AI), with an AI&lt;0.2 indicating arid/hyperarid, and AI&lt;0.5 indicating dry.
          Coldest
           /\
          /  \
     PET - -- - Rain
Coldest regions have not much evapotranspiration nor precipitation, hence polar deserts. In the warmer regions, there are deserts with maximum PET but low rainfall that make the soil even drier, and rain forests with low PET and maximum rainfall causing [[river]] systems to drain excess water into oceans.

== Classes ==
The classes defined within the system, as used by the [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]] (IIASA), are:

'''Innatism''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] doctrine that holds that the mind is born with ideas/knowledge, and that therefore the mind is not a "[[blank slate]]" at birth, as early [[Empiricism|empiricists]] such as [[John Locke]] claimed. It asserts that not all knowledge is gained from experience and the [[senses]]. [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]] are prominent philosophers in the development of innatism and the notion that the mind is already born with ideas, knowledge and beliefs.&lt;ref name=:Schmaltz/&gt; Both philosophers emphasize that experiences are the key to unlocking this knowledge but not the source of the knowledge itself. Essentially, no knowledge is derived exclusively from one's experiences as empiricists like John Locke suggested.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Stich, S. P. (1975). ''Innate ideas''. Berkley, CA: University of California Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Difference from nativism ==

In general usage, the terms ''innatism'' and ''nativism'' are synonymous as they both refer to notions of preexisting ideas present in the mind. However, more correctly,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} innatism refers to the philosophy of [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]], who assumed that a God or a similar being or process placed innate ideas and principles in the human mind.&lt;ref name=:Schmaltz&gt;Tad M. Schmaltz, ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nativism represents an adaptation of this, grounded in the fields of [[genetics]], [[cognitive psychology]], and [[psycholinguistics]]. Nativists hold that innate beliefs are in some way genetically programmed to arise in our mind&amp;mdash;that innate beliefs are the [[phenotypes]] of certain [[genotypes]] that all humans share in common.

== Nativism ==

{{main|Psychological nativism}}

Nativism is a modern view rooted in innatism. The advocates of nativism are mainly philosophers who also work in the field of [[cognitive psychology]] or [[psycholinguistics]]: most notably [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jerry Fodor]] (although the latter has adopted a more critical attitude towards nativism in his later writings). The nativist's general objection against [[empiricism]] is still the same as was raised by the [[Rationalism|rationalists]]; the human mind of a newborn child is not a [[tabula rasa]], but equipped with an inborn structure.

== Innate idea ==

In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], an '''innate idea''' is a [[concept]] or item of [[knowledge]] which is said to be ''[[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] to all [[human race|humanity]]''âthat is, something people are born with rather than something people have ''learned'' through experience.

The issue is controversial, and can be said to be an aspect of a long-running [[nature versus nurture]] debate, albeit one localized to the question of understanding human [[cognition]].

=== Philosophical debate ===

Although individual human beings obviously vary due to cultural, racial, linguistic and era-specific influences, innate ideas are said to belong to a more fundamental level of human cognition. For example, the philosopher [[RenÃ© Descartes]] theorized that knowledge of [[God]] is innate in everybody as a product of the faculty of faith.

Other philosophers, most notably the [[Empiricism|empiricists]], were critical of the theory and denied the existence of any innate ideas, saying all human knowledge was founded on experience, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning.

Philosophically, the debate over innate ideas is central to the conflict between [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and [[Empiricism|empiricist]] [[Epistemology|epistemologies]]. While rationalists believe that certain ideas exist independently of experience, empiricism claims that all knowledge is derived from experience.

[[Immanuel Kant]] was a German philosopher who is regarded as having ended the impasse in modern philosophy between rationalists and empiricists, and is widely held to have synthesized these two early modern traditions in his thought.

==== Plato ====
[[Plato]] argues that if there are certain concepts that we know to be true but did not learn from experience then it must be because we have an innate knowledge of it and this knowledge must have been gained before birth. In Plato's ''[[Meno]]'', he recalls a situation in which [[Socrates]], his mentor, questioned a slave boy about a geometry theorem. Though the slave boy had no previous experience with geometry, he was able to generate the right responses to the questions he was asked. Plato reasoned that this was possible as Socrates' questions sparked the innate knowledge of math the boy had had from birth.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lacewing, M. (n.d.). Innate knowledge''. Routledge Taylor &amp; Francis Group''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/AS/ReasonandExperience/Innate-knowledge.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Descartes ====
[[Descartes]] conveys the idea that innate knowledge or ideas is something inborn such as one would say, that a certain disease might be 'innate' to signify that a person might be at risk of contacting such a disease. He suggests that something that is 'innate' is effectively present from birth and while it may not reveal itself then, is more than likely to present itself later in life. Descartes comparison of innate knowledge to an innate disease, whose symptoms may only show up later in life, unless prohibited by a factor like age or puberty, suggests that if an event occurs prohibiting someone from exhibiting an innate behaviour or knowledge, it doesnât mean the knowledge did not exist at all but rather it wasnât expressed â they were not able to acquire that knowledge. In other words, innate beliefs, ideas and knowledge require experiences to be triggered or they may never be expressed. Experiences are not the source of knowledge as proposed by John Locke, but catalysts to the uncovering of knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== John Locke ====
The main antagonist to the concept of innate ideas is [[John Locke]], a contemporary of Leibniz. Locke argued that the mind is in fact devoid of all knowledge or ideas at birth; it is a blank sheet or ''tabula rasa''. He argued that all our ideas are constructed in the mind via a process of constant composition and decomposition of the input that we receive through our senses.

Locke, in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', suggests that the concept of universal assent in fact proves nothing, except perhaps that everyone is in agreement; in short universal assent proves that there is universal assent and nothing else. Moreover, Locke goes on to suggest that in fact there ''is'' no universal assent. Even a phrase such as "What is, is" is not universally assented to; infants and severely handicapped adults do not generally acknowledge this [[truism]]. Locke also attacks the idea that an innate idea can be imprinted on the mind without the owner realizing it. For Locke, such reasoning would allow one to conclude the absurd: âall the Truths a Man ever comes to know, will, by this account, be, every one of them, innate.â&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0sdAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22%E2%80%9Call+the+Truths+a+Man+ever+comes+to+know,+will,+by+this+account,+be,+every+one+of+them,+innate%E2%80%9D+%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DVgzhSVEu8&amp;sig=MufLd5R0cx-LNt3Xf3CwjrJApkI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb27iUxpDdAhUOEawKHWYVCLkQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%E2%80%9Call%20the%20Truths%20a%20Man%20ever%20comes%20to%20know,%20will,%20by%20this%20account,%20be,%20every%20one%20of%20them,%20innate%E2%80%9D%20%22&amp;f=false|title=An essay concerning human understanding: and a treatise on the conduct of the understanding. Complete in one volume with the author's last additions and corrections|last=Locke|first=John|date=1860|publisher=Hayes &amp; Zell|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; To return to the musical analogy, we may not be able to recall the entire melody until we hear the first few notes, but we were aware of the fact that we knew the melody and that upon hearing the first few notes we would be able to recall the rest.

Locke ends his attack upon innate ideas by suggesting that the mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'' or "blank slate", and that all ideas come from experience; all our knowledge is founded in sensory experience.

Essentially, the same knowledge thought to be ''a priori'' by Leibniz is in fact, according to Locke, the result of empirical knowledge, which has a lost origin [been forgotten] in respect to the inquirer. However, the inquirer is not cognizant of this fact; thus, he experiences what he believes to be ''a priori'' knowledge.

1) The theory of innate knowledge is excessive. Even innatists accept that most of our knowledge is learned through experience, but if that can be extended to account for all knowledge, we learn colour through seeing it, so therefore, there is no need for a theory about an innate understanding of colour.

2) No ideas are universally held. Do we all possess the idea of God? Do we all believe in justice and beauty? Do we all understand the law of identity? If not, it may not be the case that we have acquired these ideas through impressions/experience/social interaction (this is the children's and idiot's criticism).

3) Even if there are some universally agreed statements, it is just the ability of the human brain to organize learned ideas/words, that is, innate. An "ability to organize"  is not the same as "possessing propositional knowledge" (e.g., a computer with no saved files has all the operations programmed in but has an empty memory).

==== Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz ====
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] suggested that we are born with certain innate ideas, the most identifiable of these being mathematical [[truism]]s. The idea that ''1 + 1 = 2'' is evident to us without the necessity for [[empirical evidence]]. Leibniz argues that empiricism can only show us that concepts are true in the present; the observation of one apple and then another in one instance, and in that instance only, leads to the conclusion that one and another equals two. However, the suggestion that one and another will always equal two require an innate idea, as that would be a suggestion of things unwitnessed.

Leibniz called such concepts as mathematical truisms "necessary truths". Another example of such may be the phrase, "what is, is" or "it is impossible for the same thing to be and not to be". Leibniz argues that such [[truism]]s are universally assented to (acknowledged by all to be true); this being the case, it must be due to their status as innate ideas. Often there are ideas that are acknowledged as necessarily true but are not universally assented to. Leibniz would suggest that this is simply because the person in question has not become aware of the innate idea, not because they do not possess it. Leibniz argues that empirical evidence can serve to bring to the surface certain principles that are already innately embedded in our minds. This is similar to needing to hear only the first few notes in order to recall the rest of the melody.

=== Scientific ideas ===

In his ''[[Meno]]'', Plato raises an important epistemological quandary: How is it that we have certain ideas which are not conclusively derivable from our environments? [[Noam Chomsky]] has taken this problem as a philosophical framework for the scientific enquiry into innatism. His linguistic theory, which derives from 18th century [[Classical liberalism|classical-liberal]] thinkers such as [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], attempts to explain in cognitive terms how we can develop knowledge of systems which are said, by supporters of innatism, to be too rich and complex to be derived from our environment. One such example is our linguistic faculty. Our linguistic systems contain a systemic complexity which supposedly could not be empirically derived: the environment seems too poor, variable and indeterminate, according to Chomsky, to explain the extraordinary ability to learn complex concepts possessed by very young children. Essentially, their accurate grammatical knowledge cannot have originated from their experiences as their experiences are not adequate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It follows that humans must be born with a universal innate grammar, which is determinate and has a highly organized directive component, and enables the language learner to ascertain and categorize language heard into a system. Chomsky states that the ability to learn how to properly construct sentences or know which sentences are grammatically incorrect is an ability gained from innate knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Noam Chomsky cites as evidence for this theory, the apparent invariability, according to his views, of human languages at a fundamental level. In this way, linguistics may provide a window into the human mind, and establish scientific theories of innateness which otherwise would remain merely speculative.

One implication of Noam Chomsky's innatism, if correct, is that at least a part of human knowledge consists in cognitive predispositions, which are triggered and developed by the environment, but not determined by it. Chomsky suggests that we can look at how a belief is acquired as an input-output situation. He supports the doctrine of innatism as he states that human beliefs gathered from sensory experience are much richer and complex than the experience itself. He asserts that the extra information gathered is from the mind itself as it cannot solely be from  experiences. Humans derive excess amount of information from their environment so some of that information must be pre-determined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Parallels can then be drawn, on a purely speculative level, between our moral faculties and language, as has been done by sociobiologists such as [[E. O. Wilson]] and evolutionary psychologists such as [[Steven Pinker]]. The relative consistency of fundamental notions of morality across cultures seems to produce convincing evidence for these theories. In psychology, notions of [[archetypes]] such as those developed by [[Carl Jung]], suggest determinate identity perceptions.

=== Scientific evidence for innateness ===
Evidence for innatism is being found by neuroscientists working on the [[Blue Brain Project]]. They discovered that [[neuron]]s transmit signals despite an individual's experience. It had been previously assumed that neuronal circuits are made when the experience of an individual is imprinted in the brain, making memories. Researchers at Blue Brain discovered a network of about fifty neurons which they believed were building blocks of more complex knowledge but contained basic innate knowledge that could be combined in different more complex ways to give way to acquired knowledge, like memory.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Pousaz, L. (2011, March 22). ''New evidence for innate knowledge''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://actu.epfl.ch/news/new-evidence-for-innate-knowledge-5/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists ran tests on the neuronal circuits of several rats and ascertained that if the neuronal circuits had only been formed based on an individual's experience, the tests would bring about very different characteristics for each rat. However, the rats all displayed similar characteristics which suggests that their neuronal circuits must have been established previously to their experiences â it must be inborn and created prior to their experiences. The research done in the Blue Brain project expresses that some the building blocks of all our knowledge, is genetic and we're born with it.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Learning vs. innate knowledge ==

There are two ways in which animals can gain knowledge. The first of these two ways is learning. This is when an animal gathers information about its surrounding environment and then proceeds to use this information. For example, if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach, it has learned not to eat this again. The second way that an animal can acquire knowledge is through innate knowledge. This knowledge is genetically inherited. The animal automatically knows it without any prior experience. An example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk. The horse has not learned this behavior; it simply knows how to do it.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila&gt;[http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113233355/http://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/51978/1/DunlapLehtila_umn_0130E_10349.pdf |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some scenarios, innate knowledge is more beneficial than learned knowledge. However, in other scenarios the opposite is true.

=== Costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge and the evolution of learning ===

In a changing environment, an animal must constantly be gaining new information in order to survive. However, in a stable environment this same individual need only to gather the information it needs once and rely on it for the duration of its life. Therefore, there are different scenarios in which learning or innate knowledge is better suited.
Essentially, the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of having it determined whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation or whether it innately knew the information. If the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighed the benefit of having it, then the individual would not have evolved to learn in this scenario; instead, non-learning would evolve. However, if the benefit of having certain information outweighed the cost of obtaining it, then the animal would be far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt;

Non-learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios. If an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs then learning would simply be unnecessary. Because there is no need for learning in this scenario â and because learning could prove to be disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information â non-learning evolves.  However, if an environment were in a constant state of change then learning would also prove to be disadvantageous. Anything learned would immediately become irrelevant because of the changing environment.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt; The learned information would no longer apply. Essentially, the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned. In this situation, non-learning would evolve.

However, in environments where change occurs but is not constant, learning is more likely to evolve. Learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation, but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time. Therefore, learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing and adapts to changes in the environment as opposed to innate knowledge.&lt;ref name=DunlapLehtila/&gt;

'''International Women's Day''' ('''IWD''') is celebrated on March 8 every year.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html | title=UN WomenWatch: International Women's Day â  | publisher=UN.org | accessdate=February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- LINK PARTIALLY BROKEN: UN put up a redirection with JavaScript, avoidable with "stop loading" button in browsers --&gt; It is a focal point in the movement for [[women's rights]].

After the [[Socialist Party of America]] organised a Women's Day on February 28, 1909 in [[New York (city)|New York]], the [[International Socialist Women's Conferences|1910 International Socialist Woman's Conference]] suggested a Women's Day be held annually. After women gained suffrage in [[Soviet Russia]] in 1917, March 8 became a national [[holiday]] there. The day was then predominantly celebrated by the socialist movement and communist countries until it was adopted in 1975 by the [[United Nations]].

Today, International Women's Day is a public holiday in some countries and largely ignored elsewhere.&lt;ref name=RFE100 /&gt; In some places, it is a day of protest; in others, it is a day that celebrates womanhood.

In August 1910, an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Copenhagen 1910|International Socialist Women's Conference]] was organized to precede the general meeting of the Socialist [[Second International]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="ruthchild 2012"&gt;Rochelle Goldberg Ruthchild, "From West to East: International Womenâs Day, the First Decadeâ, ''Aspasia: The International Yearbook of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern European Women's and Gender History'', vol. 6 (2012): 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired in part by the American socialists, German Socialist [[Luise Zietz]] proposed the establishment of an annual Women's Day and was seconded by fellow socialist and later communist leader [[Clara Zetkin]], supported by [[KÃ¤te Duncker]], although no date was specified at that conference.&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;Temma Kaplan, "On the Socialist Origins of International Women's Day", Feminist Studies, 11/1 (Spring, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= History of International Women's Day |url= https://www.un.org/womenwatch/feature/iwd/history.html |publisher= United Nations |accessdate= May 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegates (100 women from 17 countries) agreed with the idea as a strategy to promote equal rights including [[suffrage]] for women.&lt;ref name="iwd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalwomensday.com/About|title=About International Women's Day |publisher=Internationalwomensday.com |date=March 8, 1917 |accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year on March 19, 1911, IWD was marked for the first time, by over a million people in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt; In the Austro-Hungarian Empire alone, there were 300 demonstrations.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; In Vienna, women paraded on the [[Ringstrasse]] and carried banners honouring the martyrs of the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; Women demanded that they be given the [[right to vote]] and to hold public office. They also protested against employment sex discrimination.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; The Americans continued to celebrate National Women's Day on the last Sunday in February.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt;

In 1913 [[Russian Empire|Russian]] women observed their first International Women's Day on the last Saturday in February (by the [[Julian calendar]] then used in Russia).&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;

In 1914 International Women's Day was held on March 8 in Germany, possibly because that day was a Sunday, and now it is always held on March 8 in all countries.&lt;ref name="mmf1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |title=8th of March â International woman's day: in search of lost memory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313064904/http://www.mmf2010.info/our-action/le-8-mars-2013-journee-internationale-des-femmes-a-la-recherche-de-la-memoire-perdue |archivedate=March 13, 2011|deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1914 observance of the Day in Germany was dedicated to women's right to vote, which German women did not win until 1918.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/suffrage.htm |title=Women's Suffrage |publisher=Inter-Parliamentary Union |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In London there was a march from Bow to [[Trafalgar Square]] in support of women's suffrage on March 8, 1914. [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] was arrested in front of [[Charing Cross]] station on her way to speak in Trafalgar Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suffragist Disorders|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/archive/article/1914-03-09/5/1.html#start%3D1785-01-01%26end%3D1985-12-31%26terms%3D%22Sylvia%20Pankhurst%22%20arrested%26back%3D/tto/archive/find/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/4%26prev%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/32%26next%3D/tto/archive/frame/goto/%252522Sylvia+Pankhurst%252522+arrested/w:1785-01-01%7E1985-12-31/o:date/34|accessdate=May 9, 2014|newspaper=The Times|date=March 9, 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 1917, on the [[Gregorian calendar]], in the capital of the [[Russian Empire]], [[Petrograd]], women textile workers began a demonstration, covering the whole city. This marked the beginning of the [[February Revolution]], which alongside the [[October Revolution]] made up the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ria.ru/revolution_postup/20170306/1489217048.html|title=February Revolution|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt; Women in Saint Petersburg went on strike that day for "Bread and Peace"&amp;nbsp;â demanding the end of World War I, an end to Russian food shortages, and the end of czarism.&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; [[Leon Trotsky]] wrote, "23 February (8th March) was International Woman's Day and meetings and actions were foreseen. But we did not imagine that this 'Women's Day' would inaugurate the revolution. Revolutionary actions were foreseen but without date. But in the morning, despite the orders to the contrary, textile workers left their work in several factories and sent delegates to ask for support of the strikeâ¦ which led to mass strike... all went out into the streets."&lt;ref name="mmf1" /&gt; Seven days later, the [[Emperor of Russia]], [[Nicholas II]] abdicated and the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional Government]] granted women the right to vote.&lt;ref name="unevents" /&gt;

Following the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]] [[Alexandra Kollontai]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]] made it an [[Public holiday|official holiday]] in the Soviet Union, but it was a working day until 1965. On May 8, 1965 by the decree of the [[USSR]] [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] International Women's Day was declared a non-working day in the USSR "in commemoration of the outstanding merits of Soviet women in communistic construction, in the defense of their Fatherland during the Great Patriotic War, in their heroism and selflessness at the front and in the rear, and also marking the great contribution of women to strengthening friendship between peoples, and the struggle for peace. But still, women's day must be celebrated as are other holidays."

From its official adoption in Soviet Russia following the Revolution in 1917, the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist countries and by the communist movement worldwide. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922.&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt; After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the State Council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anniversaries of important events|url=http://www.gov.cn/english/2005-08/10/content_28291.htm|website=China Factfile|publisher=Chinese Government|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist leader [[Dolores IbÃ¡rruri]] led a women's march in Madrid in 1936 on the eve of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="kaplan" /&gt;

The [[United Nations]] began celebrating International Women's Day in the [[International Women's Year]], 1975. In 1977, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the [[UN Day]] for [[women's rights]] and [[world peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/international-womens-day|title=International Women's Day |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of 2010 International Women's Day the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) drew attention to the hardships displaced women endure.

Australia issued an IWD 100th anniversary [[Commemorative coins of Australia#20 cent coin|commemorative 20-cent coin]].

In Egypt, however, the day was a step back for women. In Egypt's [[Tahrir Square]], hundreds of men came out not in support, but to harass the women who came out to stand up for their rights as the police and military stood by watching the events unfold in front of them, doing nothing to stop the crowds of men. "The women&amp;nbsp;â some in headscarves and flowing robes, others in jeans&amp;nbsp;â had marched to Cairo's central Tahrir Square to celebrate International Women's Day.

On the occasion of International Women's Day 2012, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] called for more action to help the mothers and wives of people who have gone missing during armed conflict. The vast majority of people who go missing in connection with conflict are men. As well as the anguish of not knowing what has happened to the missing husband or son, many of these women face economic and practical difficulties. The ICRC underlined the duty of parties to a conflict to search for the missing and provide information to the families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2012/women-day-news-2012.htm Helping women take matters into their own hands] International Committee of the Red Cross&lt;/ref&gt;

In a message in support of International Women's Day, the UN Secretary-General [[AntÃ³nio Guterres]] commented on how [[women's rights]] were being "reduced, restricted and reversed". With men still in leadership positions and a widening economic [[Gender pay gap|gender gap]], he called for change "by empowering women at all levels, enabling their voices to be heard and giving them control over their own lives and over the future of our world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2017/3/statement-sg-international-womens-day-2017|title=UN Secretary-General's Message for International Women's Day|date=6 March 2017|publisher=UN|accessdate=8 March 2017 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On this day it is customary for men to give the women in their lives&amp;nbsp;â friends, mothers, wives, girlfriends, daughters, colleagues, etc.&amp;nbsp;â flowers and small gifts. In some countries (such as Bulgaria and Romania) it is also observed as an equivalent of Mother's Day, where children also give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.&lt;ref name="agentia.org" /&gt; In Russia, the day has lost all political context through the time, becoming simply a day to honor women and feminine beauty.&lt;ref&gt;''[[ÐÑÑÐ¸ÐµÐ², Ð¡ÐµÑÐ³ÐµÐ¹ ÐÐ°ÑÐ°ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ|Ð¡ÐµÑÐ³ÐµÐ¹ ÐÑÑÐ¸ÐµÐ²]]''.

In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], huge Soviet-style celebrations were held annually. After the fall of Communism, the holiday, generally considered to be one of the major symbols of the old regime, fell into obscurity. International Women's Day was re-established as an official "important day" by the [[Parliament of the Czech Republic]] in 2004&lt;ref name="KapustaâPofahl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/aeer/article/viewFile/1284/1356 |title=Reinstating International Women's Day in the Czech Republic: Feminism, Politics and the Specter of Communism |author= Karen KapustaâPofahl |publisher=Washburn University |access-date= February 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the proposal of the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] and [[Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia|Communists]]. This has provoked some controversy as a large part of the public as well as the political right see the holiday as a relic of the nation's Communist past.&lt;ref name="KapustaâPofahl" /&gt;

International Women's Day sparked violence in [[Tehran]], Iran on March 4, 2007, when police beat hundreds of men and women who were planning a rally. (A previous rally for the occasion was held in Tehran in 2003.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4555610/international_womens_day_rally_in/ "Iranian Women Rally to Demand Equal Social, Political Rights"] ''Index-Journal'' (March 9, 2003): 9. via [[Newspapers.com]]{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested dozens of women and some were released after several days of solitary confinement and interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Frances |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6426087.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iranian women struggle for equality |publisher=BBC News |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shadi Sadr]], [[Mahbubeh Abbasgholizadeh]] and several more community activists were released on March 19, 2007, ending a fifteen-day hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/03/07/iran15452.htm |title=Iran: Release Women's Rights Advocates &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=March 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mimosa2007.JPG|150px|thumb|left|[[Acacia dealbata|Yellow mimosa]] is the symbol of IWD in Italy]]
In Italy, to celebrate the day, men give [[Acacia dealbata|yellow mimosas]] to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/societa/otto/otto/otto.html |title=la Repubblica/societa: 8 marzo, niente manifestazione tante feste diverse per le donne |publisher=Repubblica.it |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/c/sezioni/politica/versoelezioni34/ciampidonne/ciampidonne.html |title=politica " Festa della donna, parla Ciampi "La paritÃ  Ã¨ ancora lontana" |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=March 8, 2006 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communist politician [[Teresa Mattei]] chose the mimosa in 1946 as the symbol of IWD in Italy because she felt that the French symbols of the day, [[Violet (plant)|violets]] and [[lily-of-the-valley]], were too scarce and expensive to be used effectively in Italy.&lt;ref name=florentine&gt;{{cite news|first=Dierdre|last=Pirro|title=Teresa Mattei, Flower power |url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=5425 |work=[[The Florentine]] |publisher= |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, actress and human rights activist [[Beata Pozniak]] worked with the Mayor of Los Angeles and the Governor of California to lobby members of the U.S. Congress to propose official recognition of the holiday. In February 1994, H. J. Res. 316 was introduced by Rep. [[Maxine Waters]], along with 79 cosponsors, in an attempt to officially recognize March 8 of that year as International Women's Day. The bill was subsequently referred to, and remained in, the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. No vote of either house of Congress was achieved on this piece of legislation.&lt;ref name="billsummary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d103:h.j.res.00316: |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status 103rd Congress (1993â1994) H.J.RES.316 |publisher=Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2330">The '''law of contagion''' is a magical law that suggests that once two people or objects have been in contact a magical link persists between them unless or until a formal [[Ritual purification|cleansing]], [[consecration]], [[exorcism]], or other act of [[banishing]] breaks the non-material bond. The first description of the law of contagion appeared in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[James George Frazer]]. [[Isaac Bonewits|Bonewits and Bonewits]] have noted parallels in quantum physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonewits|first1=Phaedra|last2=Bonewits|first2=Isaac|title=Real Energy: Systems, Spirits, and Substances to Heal, Change, and Grow|date=2007|publisher=New Page Books|location=[[Franklin Lakes, New Jersey]]|isbn=1564149048|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and dangers==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
According to this law, contagion has both dangers and benefits. Benefits, for example, include that the holiness of a [[saint]], [[god]] or other venerated figure confers benefits to [[relic]]s, as do [[temple]]s and [[church (building)|churches]], by virtue of their having [[religious]] [[ritual]]s conducted within them. [[Psychics]] and [[mediumship|mediums]] commonly utilize an object once owned by a missing or deceased subject as their "focus" for [[psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]] or [[clairvoyance]] or during [[sÃ©ance]]s.

Dangers include, for example, a [[magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] or [[witch]] might acquire a lock of hair, [[nail clipping]] or scrap of clothing in order to facilitate a [[curse]]. [[Voodoo doll]]s resemble the victim and often incorporate hair or clothing from them. In cultures that practice sorcery individuals often exercise care that their hair or nails do not end up in the hands of sorcerers.

==Unconscious belief in the law of contagion==
Even among people who do not profess a belief in magic, [[psychological experiment]]s have shown a reluctance on the part of the public to, say, try on a sweater worn by a [[serial murderer]].{{citation required|date=July 2017}}

'''''Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass''''' is a [[anthology|collection of essays]] written by British writer, doctor, and [[psychiatrist]] [[Theodore Dalrymple]] and published in book form by [[Ivan R. Dee]] in 2001. In 1994, the [[Manhattan Institute for Policy Research|Manhattan Institute]] started publishing the contents of these essays in the [[City Journal (New York)|''City Journal'']] magazine. They are about personal [[:wikt:responsibility|responsibility]], the [[mentality]] of society as a whole, and the troubles of the [[underclass]]. Dalrymple had problems in finding a British publisher to help him turn his individual essays into a collection, so he eventually turned to American companies for publication.

The main themes expressed in the collection include how an individual's [[worldview]] (''Weltanschauung'') affects their actions and the attitudes of those around them, the philosophy of [[social determinism]], and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in [[determinism]]. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.

Most reviews of the collection were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often became too opinionated in his writing while he was trying to get across the results of his experiences.

==Background==
Between 1990 and 2000, "Theodore Dalrymple", whose real name is Anthony Daniels, worked as a physician at [[City Hospital, Birmingham|City Hospital]] and [[Birmingham Prison]], both located in the [[Winson Green]] area of [[Birmingham]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Imperfect Fit: Advanced Democracy and Human Nature |last=Klemes |first=Vit |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Trafford Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=290 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_16Y-4NMWr8C&amp;pg=PA290 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life at the Bottom Created by Those on Top |first=Darryn |last=Martin |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Sentinel]] |date=7 January 2004 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-91949797.html |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he wrote essays on topics related to his work, such as his discussions with patients and [[Convict|inmates]]. Individual essays began being published periodically in the American quarterly magazine ''City Journal'' in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=[[Ivan R.

The experiences and situations described are largely [[Anecdote|anecdotal]], but Dalrymple explains that he interviewed over 10,000 people who attempted suicide and had them tell stories about "the lives of four or five other people", resulting in a sample base of around 50,000 individuals.&lt;ref name="Ethics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Actual ethics |last=Otteson |first=James |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= |page=173 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbnLn6A3q-4C&amp;pg=PA173 |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=[[Ivan R.

According to social critic [[Thomas Sowell]], this allows a look at the underclass "without fear of being called 'racist'."&lt;ref name="Bleak" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life at the bottom remains a real nightmare |first=Thomas |last=Sowell |newspaper=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |date=8 November 2001 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZhQ0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KiEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2271,670715&amp;dq=life-at-the-bottom+dalrymple&amp;hl=en |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his attempts to have his collection published in a single work, Dalrymple turned to "an American house of conservative leaning"&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt; because he had little luck with British publishers. The publisher who eventually helped Dalrymple release the book was the Ivan R. Dee imprint of [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]] publishing house. They published the collection as a hardcover in 2001.&lt;ref name="Third"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearse |first=Meic |date= December 2002 |title=Life at the Bottom: the worldview that makes the underclass Review |trans_title= |journal=[[Third Way Magazine|Third Way]] |volume=25 |series= |issue= 10 |page=27 |pages= |at= |publisher=Hymns Ancient &amp; Modern Ltd |location= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |oclc= |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ll39wzxRnMMC&amp;pg=PA27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ayn-rand.info/cth--582-Rousseaus_Children.aspx |title=Rousseau's Children |last=Donway|first= Roger |date= |work= |publisher=[[The Atlas Society]] |accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
The collection of essays has an [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]], an [[Index (publishing)|index]], and two sections called "''Grim Reality''" and "''Grimmer Theory''". The sections are individually broken up into chapters, with sixteen in "''Grim Reality''" and six in "''Grimmer Theory''". Each chapter is an individual essay, which were published in separate issues of ''City Journal'' around seven years prior. The chapters are organised [[Theme (literature)|thematically]], not necessarily in [[Chronology|chronological order]].&lt;ref name="Original"&gt;{{cite book |title=Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=[[Ivan R.

The main argument represented in the collection is that, rather than economics and wealth, modern-style poverty is described by a "wildly dysfunctional set of values".&lt;ref name="Bleak"&gt;{{cite news|title=Portrait of the poor both sharp and bleak |first=Theresa K. |last=Weaver |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=16 December 2001 |url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_ajc-portrait_of_the_poor.htm |accessdate=8 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828151539/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_ajc-portrait_of_the_poor.htm |archivedate=28 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of chapters discuss the "ferocious young egoist" that is meant to represent male youths who are violent and obsessive toward their [[significant other]]s. Dalrymple also writes about his views on the "destruction of...family ties", arguing that without family ties it is nearly impossible to rise out of the underclass.&lt;ref name="Insightful"&gt;{{cite news |title=An insightful, painful picture of the underclass |first=Thomas |last=Sowell |newspaper=[[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]] |date=2 November 2001 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RIYUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4gMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5479,517511&amp;dq=life-at-the-bottom+dalrymple&amp;hl=en |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues, among others, are described as resulting from the "intellectual foundation...[which] makes a permanent underclass possible". This is meant to be directed against intellectuals and liberals that form the many ideas absorbed into the mentality of the underclass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book review: Conservative dissects European apathy |first=John |last=Broening |newspaper=[[The Denver Post]] |date=11 July 2010 |url=http://www.denverpost.com/recommended/ci_15470639 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the larger first section titled "''Grim Reality''", Dalrymple "uses specific stories from his practice and from some journalistic forays to show how the 'fundamental premise of popular culture' leads to actions that wreck people's lives."&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt; This section covers things like modern [[Bohemianism]], [[Substance dependence|drug addictions]] and [[Drug overdose|overdoses]], lack of education, familial obligations, [[physical abuse]], and the concept of personal responsibility for choices made.&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt; Then, in the section "''Grimmer Theory''", he "shows that the twentieth century's intellectuals have provided members of the underclass with a battery of rationalizations by which they can shift the blame for their misery away from their actions and attitudes and can unleash their hatred of everyone who challenges their outlook.".&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt; Focusing on ideas more than events, this section considers the concepts of [[relativism]], [[determinism]], and [[egalitarianism]], and how each idea, in their creation by the [[bourgeoisie]] [[intellectual]]s, adversely affects the underclass.&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt;

==Themes==
The work explores the various [[worldview]]s of individuals and societies, and the impositions of society on those within it. Dalrymple states that "...everyone has a Weltanschauung, a worldview, whether he knows it or not...Their ideas make themselves manifest even in the language they use."&lt;ref name="Humboldt"/&gt; The example stated is the use of [[Passive voice|passive speech]] by "those who refuse to accept responsibility for their acts". The type of language that the underclass uses, according to Dalrymple, professes their own ideas and ideology about the world.&lt;ref name="Humboldt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Humboldt, worldview and language |last=Underhill |first=James W. |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location= |isbn= |page=129 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JkMHVkgZcEsC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22Life+at+the+Bottom%22+Dalrymple&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Uz6FTPeSLoGBlAeZzpHSDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Life%20at%20the%20Bottom%22%20Dalrymple&amp;f=false |accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also explains the philosophy of [[social determinism]] held by those Dalrymple interviewed, and how the [[welfare state]] and the socialist tenets within it help feed this mindset. However, Dalrymple never directly accuses socialism and the welfare state in his essays, instead focusing on the beliefs and reasons for why the patients and inmates take the destructive actions that they did. This is expressed with determinism in that they believe that their actions must be based on their childhoods or the failure of society in the past to help them.&lt;ref name="Carolina"&gt;{{cite news |title=Life at the Bottom: Socialism Destroys Freedom |first=Arthur E. |last=Foulkes |newspaper=[[John Locke Foundation|Carolina Journal]] |date=January 2004 |url=http://www.johnlocke.org/acrobat/cjPrintEdition/cj_2004_jan.pdf  |page=18 |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liberty"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark |first=John |date=December 2002 |title=Living and Dying in Socialist Britain |journal=[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]] |publisher=[[R.

An important subset to this deterministic theme, related to the original worldview idea as well, is the lack of personal responsibility that those in the underclass accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, "The knife went in", in reference to the words of one of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions seem like they are something separate from the person themselves and that they have no control over it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olasky|first= Martin |date=9 August 2008 |title=Drug of choice |journal=[[World (magazine)|WORLD Magazine]] |publisher= |volume=23 |issue= 16 |pages= |url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/14243 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sub-theme that is mentioned is the conflict between two groups, the [[Sikhism in the United Kingdom|Indian Sikhs]] and the [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani Muslims]], who "not only cannot get along with each other but also cannot adapt to secular Britain". This conflict is shown throughout the collection, usually when an Indian or Pakistani woman is acting as a patient for Dalrymple, who then extracts the story for why the person is there. However, there are only a few stories told from the perspective of Indian Sikhs and Pakistani Muslims since the majority of the patients and prisoners that Dalrymple interviews are white.&lt;ref name="Mental" /&gt;

==Style==
Meic Pearse of ''[[Third Way Magazine|Third Way]]'' magazine described the style of the collection as "funny yet depressing, easy to read yet extremely profound."&lt;ref name="Third" /&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' considered the writing to be "graceful and often witty", although the "main points get hammered home too quickly and too often".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=22 October 2001 |title=Review |journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |publisher= |volume=248 |issue=43 |page=67 |url=http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_pubweek-life.htm |accessdate=15 November 2010 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622101119/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_pubweek-life.htm |archivedate=22 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor D. of the ''[[National Review]]'' considered the style to be "extraordinary", with "clear and penetrating prose" that was "always fearless for the truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dr. D |date=11 February 2002 |title=Dr. D's Diagnosis |journal=[[National Review]] |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1321826/Dr-D-s-Diagnosis-book.html |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Otteson|James R. Otteson]], in his novel ''Actual Ethics'', spoke of how Dalrymple "does not employ the facts and figures", but "relies instead on his anecdotal experience". This, however, allows the "patterns [to] crystallize with [[wikt:pellucid|pellucid]] clarity [very clear, transparently clear]".&lt;ref name="Ethics" /&gt;

==Critical reception==
''Life at the Bottom'' has received mostly positive reviews. Gregory Schneider of the ''[[The Topeka Capital-Journal|Topeka Capital-Journal]]'' called the collection "the best exploration of the problems of poverty ever written."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lots of good reading for the right folks |first=Gregory L. |last=Schneider |newspaper=[[Topeka Capital-Journal]] |date=12 December 2005 |url=http://cjonline.com/stories/121205/opi_schneidercol.shtml |accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' magazine writer, Peter Heinegg, considered the essays to be a "barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life...stories", but he said that Dalrymple puts too much of his personal "snorting indignation" into the text without letting the reader draw their own conclusions. He ended by saying, "Dalrymple's case sounds like a paranoid tirade or perverse tribute, but it is at least partially redeemed by the barrage of breathtakingly horrible true-life (one assumes) stories that this very angry doctor tells...to bolster it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinegg |first=Peter |date=6 May 2002 |title=Downhill Since Victoria |journal=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] |publisher= |volume=186 |issue=15 |pages= |url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=1832 |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |accessdate=8 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612112147/http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=1832 |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Clark of ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine called it "so compelling...that I read it cover to cover in a day's timeâand later reread it twice."&lt;ref name="Liberty" /&gt;

[[Thomas Sowell]], a pundit and [[Critic|social critic]], described it as "brilliant and insightful" in ''Capitalism'' magazine&lt;ref name="Capitalism"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sowell |first=Thomas |date=3 June 2006 |title=Preserving a Visionâat the Expense of the Facts |journal=Capitalism |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/culture/4687-Preserving-Vision---the-Expense-the-Facts.html |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |accessdate=1 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "an insightful and devastating eyewitness account of the white underclass in Britain" in the ''[[Jewish World Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Holiday book picks |first=Thomas |last=Sowell |newspaper=[[Jewish World Review]] |date=6 December 2005 |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/sowell120605.asp |accessdate=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Sowell said that the collection was able to explain that "One of the most telling examples of the social destructiveness of the left's welfare-state vision can be found among the white slum dwellers in Britain."&lt;ref name="Capitalism"/&gt; ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' writer, Theresa K. Weaver, called the collection "saddening, infuriating, and ultimately not terribly empowering", stating that she wishes Dalrymple "might at least offer a few ideas on turning everything around."&lt;ref name="Bleak" /&gt; Arthur Foulkes of the ''[[John Locke Foundation|Carolina Journal]]'' described it as a "fine book" that "offers much to friends of liberty everywhere."&lt;ref name="Carolina" /&gt; Roger Donway of ''[[The Atlas Society]]'' considered it to be "one of the most instructive books that I have read in many years".&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt; Stephen Goode, writing for ''[[Insight on the News]]'', said that the collection argued its "position brilliantly and with impressive passion".&lt;ref name="Goode" /&gt; The ''[[National Observer (Australia)|National Observer]]'' wrote that it "has much value", if it is taken as an "antidote to fashionable loose thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=22 March 2002 |title=Life at the Bottom (Book Review) |journal=[[National Observer (Australia)|National Observer]] |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1560495/Life-at-the-Bottom-Book.html |doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The idea that there are specific '''marine counterparts to land creatures''',&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly expressed by [[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], "It used to be a common belief that everything on the earth had its counterpart in the sea" ([[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], Kenneth Frazier, ''Bestiary: Being a Translation of a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1954), reissued as ''The Book of Beasts'' 1960:250ff).&lt;/ref&gt; inherited from the writers on [[natural history]] in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]], was firmly believed in [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hasan M. El-Shamy, ''Folk traditions of the Arab world: a guide to motif classification'', 1995, under F133.1, Marine counterpart to land.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medieval Europe]], and is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. "The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines," T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. "Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a [[Pegasus]] in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;T.H. White, ''op. cit'' p 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect [[symmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;The "perfection" of symmetry was an idea highly developed in the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creator_deity|Creator]]'s plan, offered as the "[[book of nature]]" to mankind, for which a text could be found in ''[[Book of Job|Job]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Job 12:7â10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source â the land is referred to as "Chaled", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.
 
All of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the "[[watchmaker analogy]]" offered as a proof of God's existence.

The correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for [[allegory]] engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of [[exegesis]], which also encouraged the [[doctrine of signatures]], a "key" to the meaning and use of herbs.

The source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the ''[[Physiologus]]'', one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further "exemplary" beasts in the next three centuries and more, ''Physiologus'' was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestiary.ca/intro.htm David Badke, "The Medieval Bestiary: Introduction"]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the Characteristics of Animals'' (A. F. Scholfield, in [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1958).

Christian writers, trained in [[Anagoge|anagogical thinking]] and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in [[Pliny's Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Naturalis''IX.2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the idea is presented as a "vulgar opinion": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. 

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] reasons based on [[analogy]], that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a [[Leviathan]] in the sea, there must be a [[Behemoth]] on the land. (''City of God''? xi.15?)

&lt;!--this doctrine doesn't appear in the on-line translation of excerpts:[[Isidore of Seville]]'s encyclopedic ''Etymologiae'',&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologiae'' XII?&lt;/ref&gt; contained a section about animals, derived from Classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]].--&gt; 
The reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical [[Scientific thinking|scientific thought]] in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] devoted a chapter of his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: "That all Animals in the land are in their kinde&lt;!--kinde in original--&gt; in the Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo324.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by [[BenoÃ®t de Maillet]] in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the [[Dianthus|Pink]], the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?&lt;ref&gt;Maillet, ''Telliamed'': "Sixth Day: Origin of Man and Animals"; this and several further passages are quoted in Mary Efrosini Gregory, ''Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought'' :22f., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,&lt;blockquote&gt;For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Moby-Dick'', ch. 58 "Brit".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
in discussing [[dolphin]]s trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article could still casually state: "It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|Man-in-the-Sea program]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stimson, "Lifeguards: Friendly dolphinsâ the mammals with the high IQâ are being trained for undersea rescue missions", ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33900">In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''maximum sustainable yield''' or '''MSY''' is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) that can be taken from a species' stock over an indefinite period.  Fundamental to the notion of [[sustainable harvest]], the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely.  Under the assumption of [[logistic function|logistic growth]], resource limitation does not constrain individuals' reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small.  At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the [[carrying capacity]], individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate.  At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals.  Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity.  At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero.  The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the [[optimum sustainable yield]] and [[maximum economic yield]].

MSY is extensively used for [[fisheries management]]. Unlike the logistic ([[Milner Baily Schaefer|Schaefer]]) model,&lt;ref name="Schaefer"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSY has been refined in most modern fisheries models and occurs at around 30% &lt;ref name ="Thorpe"&gt;Thorpe 2015&lt;/ref&gt; of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

However, the approach has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and has led to the devastating collapse of many fisheries. As a simple calculation, it ignores the size and age of the animal being taken, its reproductive status, and it focuses solely on the species in question, ignoring the damage to the ecosystem caused by the designated level of exploitation and the issue of bycatch. Among [[Conservation biology|conservation biologists]] it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.&lt;ref name=Epitaph&gt;Larkin PA (1977) [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:0ZITmBnzlDUJ:fiesta.bren.ucsb.edu/~gsd/595e/docs/22.%2520Larkin_Epitaph_Max_Sust_Yield.pdf+Larkin+1977+%22An+epitaph+for+the+concept+of+maximum+sustained+yield%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=nz&amp;sig=AHIEtbSBFh-w5xzWiBK7rnHSLBmolsfaWA "An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Transactions of the American Fisheries Society'', '''106''': 1â11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;[[Carl Walters|Walters C]] and Maguire J (1996) "Lessons for stock assessment from the northern cod collapse", ''Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries'', '''6''':125â137.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of MSY as a fisheries management strategy developed in [[Belmar, New Jersey|Belmar]], [[New Jersey]], in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="Russell1931"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=E. S.|title=Some theoretical Considerations on the "Overfishing" Problem|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=6|issue=1|year=1931|pages=3â20|issn=1054-3139|doi=10.1093/icesjms/6.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hjort et al 1933&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graham1935"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham|first1=M.|title=Modern Theory of Exploiting a Fishery, and Application to North Sea Trawling|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=10|issue=3|year=1935|pages=264â274|issn=1054-3139|doi=10.1093/icesjms/10.3.264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It increased in popularity in the 1950s with the advent of surplus-production models with explicitly estimate MSY.&lt;ref name="Schaefer"/&gt;  As an apparently simple and logical management goal, combined with the lack of other simple management goals of the time, MSY was adopted as the primary management goal by several international organizations (e.g., [[International Whaling Commission|IWC]], [[Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission|IATTC]],&lt;ref&gt;IATTC, Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas|ICCAT]], [[Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization|ICNAF]]), and individual countries.&lt;ref name="Mace"&gt;Mace 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1949 and 1955, the U.S. maneuvered to have MSY declared the goal of international fisheries management (Johnson 2007).  The international MSY treaty that was eventually adopted in 1955 gave foreign fleets the right to fish off any coast. Nations that wanted to exclude foreign boats had to first prove that its fish were overfished.&lt;ref name="Botsford"&gt;Botsford et al 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

As experience was gained with the model, it became apparent to some researchers that it lacked the capability to deal with the real world operational complexities and the influence of [[Trophic level|trophic]] and other interactions. In 1977, [[Peter Anthony Larkin|Peter Larkin]] wrote its epitaph, challenging the goal of maximum sustained yield on several grounds: It put populations at too much risk; it did not account for spatial variability in productivity; it did not account for species other than the focus of the fishery; it considered only the benefits, not the costs, of fishing; and it was sensitive to political pressure.&lt;ref name="Larkin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Larkin|first1=P. A.|title=An epitaph for the concept of maximum sustained yield|journal=Transactions of the American Fisheries Society|volume=106|issue=1|year=1977|pages=1â11|issn=0002-8487|doi=10.1577/1548-8659(1977)106&lt;1:AEFTCO&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, none of these criticisms was aimed at sustainability as a goal. The first one noted that seeking the absolute MSY with uncertain parameters was risky. The rest point out that the goal of MSY was not holistic; it left out too many relevant features.&lt;ref name="Botsford"/&gt;

Some managers began to use more conservative quota recommendations, but the influence of the MSY model for [[fisheries management]] still prevailed. Even while the scientific community was beginning to question the appropriateness and effectiveness of MSY as a management goal,&lt;ref name="Larkin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sissenwine 1978&lt;/ref&gt; it was incorporated into the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea]], thus ensuring its integration into national and international fisheries acts and laws.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt; According to Walters and Maguire, an ââinstitutional juggernaut had been set in motionââ, climaxing in the early 1990s with the [[Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of northern cod]].&lt;ref&gt;Walters and Maguire, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modelling MSY ==

=== Population growth ===
{{see also|Population growth}}

The key assumption behind all [[sustainable harvest]]ing models such as MSY is that populations of organisms grow and replace themselves â that is, they are renewable resources.  Additionally it is assumed that because the growth rates, survival rates, and reproductive rates increase when harvesting reduces [[population density]],&lt;ref name="Russell1931"/&gt; they produce a surplus of biomass that can be harvested.  Otherwise, [[sustainable harvest]] would not be possible.

Another assumption of renewable resource harvesting is that populations of [[organisms]] do not continue to grow indefinitely; they reach an equilibrium population size, which occurs when the number of individuals matches the resources available to the population (i.e., assume classic [[logistic function|logistic growth]]).  At this equilibrium population size, called the [[carrying capacity]], the population remains at a stable size.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998, pp. 14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:logisticpopulationgrowth2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1]]

The logistic model (or [[logistic function]]) is a function that is used to describe bounded [[population growth]] under the previous two assumptions.  The [[logistic function]] is bounded at both extremes: when there are not individuals to reproduce, and when there is an equilibrium number of individuals (i.e., at [[carrying capacity]]).  Under the logistic model, population growth rate between these two limits is most often assumed to be [[sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] (Figure 1).  There is scientific evidence that some populations do grow in a logistic fashion towards a stable equilibrium â a commonly cited example is the [[logistic growth]] of [[yeast]].

The equation describing logistic growth is:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; N_{t} = \frac{K}{1 + \frac{K-N_0}{N_0} e^{-rt}}&lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.1)

The parameter values are:
:: &lt;math&gt; N_{t}&lt;/math&gt;=The population size at time t

:: &lt;math&gt; K&lt;/math&gt;=The carrying capacity of the population

:: &lt;math&gt; N_{0}&lt;/math&gt;= The population size at time zero

:: &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;= the intrinsic rate of population increase (the rate at which the population grows when it is very small)

From the logistic function, the population size at any point can be calculated as long as &lt;math&gt; r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; N_{0}&lt;/math&gt; are known.

[[Image:growthratevs.populationsize.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 2]]

Differentiating equation 1.1 give an expression for how the rate of population increases as N increases.  At first, the population growth rate is fast, but it begins to slow as the population grows until it levels off to the maximum growth rate, after which it begins to decrease (figure 2).

The equation for figure 2 is the differential of equation 1.1 ([[Pierre FranÃ§ois Verhulst|Verhulst's]] 1838 [[Logistic function#In ecology: modeling population growth|growth model]]):&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = r N \left(1 - \frac {N}{K} \right)&lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.2)

&lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; can be understood as the change in population (N) with respect to a change in time (t).  Equation 1.2 is the usual way in which logistic growth is represented mathematically and has several important features.  First, at very low population sizes, the value of &lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{K}&lt;/math&gt; is small, so the population growth rate is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt; rN&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the population is growing exponentially at a rate r (the intrinsic rate of population increase).  Despite this, the population growth rate is very low (low values on the y-axis of figure 2) because, even though each individual is reproducing at a high rate, there are few reproducing individuals present.  Conversely, when the population is large the value of &lt;math&gt; \frac{N}{K}&lt;/math&gt; approaches 1 effectively reducing the terms inside the brackets of equation 1.2 to zero.  The effect is that the population growth rate is again very low, because either each individual is hardly reproducing or mortality rates are high.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   As a result of these two extremes, the population growth rate is maximum at an intermediate population or half the carrying capacity (&lt;math&gt;N= \frac{K}{2}&lt;/math&gt;).

=== MSY model ===

[[Image:harvestingrates.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 3]]

The simplest way to model harvesting is to modify the logistic equation so that a certain number of individuals is continuously removed:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) - H &lt;/math&gt; (equation 1.3)

Where H represents the number of individuals being removed from the population â that is, the harvesting rate.  When H is constant, the population will be at equilibrium when the number of individuals being removed is equal to the population growth rate (figure 3). The equilibrium population size under a particular harvesting regime can be found when the population is not growing â that is, when &lt;math&gt; \frac{dN}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  This occurs when the population growth rate is the same as the harvest rate:

:: &lt;math&gt; rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right) = H &lt;/math&gt;

Figure 3 shows how growth rate varies with population density.  For low densities (far from carrying capacity), there is little addition (or "recruitment") to the population, simply because there are few organisms to give birth.  At high densities, though, there is intense competition for resources, and growth rate is again low because the death rate is high.  In between these two extremes, the population growth rate rises to a maximum value (&lt;math&gt; N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt;).   This maximum point represents the maximum number of individuals that can be added to a population by natural processes.  If more individuals than this are removed from the population, the population is at risk for decline to extinction.&lt;ref name="Jennings"&gt;Jennings et al 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum number that can be harvested in a sustainable manner, called the maximum sustainable yield, is given by this maximum point.

Figure 3 also shows several possible values for the harvesting rate, H.  At &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;, there are two possible population equilibrium points: a low population size (&lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt;) and a high one (&lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt;).  At &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, a slightly higher harvest rate, however there is only one equilibrium point (at &lt;math&gt; N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt;), which is the population size that produces the maximum growth rate.  With logistic growth, this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, is where the population size is half the carrying capacity (or &lt;math&gt; N = \frac{K}{2}&lt;/math&gt;). The maximum sustainable yield is the largest yield that can be taken from a population at equilibrium.
In figure 3, if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is higher than &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, the harvesting would exceed the population's capacity to replace itself at any population size (&lt;math&gt; H_3&lt;/math&gt; in figure 3).  Because harvesting rate is higher than the population growth rate at all values of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, this rate of harvesting is not sustainable.

An important feature of the MSY model is how harvested populations respond to environmental fluctuations or illegal offtake.  Consider a population at &lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt; harvested at a constant harvest level &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;.  If the population falls (due to a bad winter or illegal harvest) this will ease density-dependent population regulation and increase yield, moving the population back to &lt;math&gt;N_b&lt;/math&gt;, a stable equilibrium.  In this case, a negative feedback loop creates stability.  The lower equilibrium point for the constant harvest level &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; is not stable however; a population crash or illegal harvesting will decrease population yield farther below the current harvest level, creating a [[positive feedback]] loop leading to extinction.  Harvesting at &lt;math&gt;N_{MSY}&lt;/math&gt; is also potentially unstable.  A small decrease in the population can lead to a positive feedback loop and extinction if the harvesting regime (&lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;) is not reduced.  Thus, some consider harvesting at MSY to be unsafe on ecological and economic grounds.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"&gt;Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  The MSY model itself can be modified to harvest a certain percentage of the population or with constant effort constraints rather than an actual number, thereby avoiding some of its instabilities.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;

The MSY equilibrium point is semi-stable â a small increase in population size is compensated for, a small decrease to extinction if H is not decreased.  Harvesting at MSY is therefore dangerous because it is on a knife-edge â any small population decline leads to a positive feedback, with the population declining rapidly to extinction if the number of harvested stays the same.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;

The formula for maximum sustained harvest (&lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;) is one-fourth the maximum population or carrying capacity (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) times the intrinsic rate of growth (&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;Bolden and Robinson 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; H = \frac{Kr}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

=== For demographically structured populations ===
The principle of MSY often holds for age-structured populations as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=William J.|date=1980-01-01|title=Optimum Age-Specific Harvesting in a Nonlinear Population Model|jstor=2556112|journal=Biometrics|volume=36|issue=4|pages=579â593|doi=10.2307/2556112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculations can be more complicated, and the results often depend on whether density dependence occurs in the larval stage (often modeled as density dependent reproduction) and/or other life stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=2HjvNbzWuTMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=%22Optimal+Control+of+Age-structured+Populations+in+Economy,+Demography,+and+the+Environment&amp;ots=mCg54KPuRi&amp;sig=eWk-Pz7XeB7WxXHUVeLywWMWais#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Optimal%20Control%20of%20Age-structured%20Populations%20in%20Economy,%20Demography,%20and%20the%20Environment&amp;f=false|title=Optimal Control of Age-structured Populations in Economy, Demography, and the Environment|last=Boucekkine|first=Raouf|last2=Hritonenko|first2=Natali|last3=Yatsenko|first3=Yuri|date=2013-05-13|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136920935|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that if density dependence only acts on larva, then there is an optimal life stage (size or age class) to harvest, with no harvest of all other life stages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Hence the optimal strategy is to harvest this most valuable life-stage at MSY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Getz|first=Wayne M.|date=1980-01-01|title=The ultimate-sustainable-yield problem in nonlinear age-structured populations|url=https://www.mysciencework.com/publication/show/157dcc9f75a6172a154d8c9da5c7e7bb|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|language=en|volume=48|issue=3-4|pages=279â292|doi=10.1016/0025-5564(80)90062-0|issn=0025-5564|access-date=2017-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203111733/https://www.mysciencework.com/publication/show/157dcc9f75a6172a154d8c9da5c7e7bb|archive-date=2017-02-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in age and stage-structured models, a constant MSY does not always exist. In such cases, cyclic harvest is optimal where the yield and resource fluctuate in size, through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Optimal Harvesting of Age-structured Fish Populations|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/full/10.5950/0738-1360-24.2.147|journal=Marine Resource Economics|language=en-US|doi=10.5950/0738-1360-24.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, environmental stochasticity interacts with demographically structured populations in fundamentally different ways than for unstructured populations when determining optimal harvest. In fact, the optimal biomass to be left in the ocean, when fished at MSY, can be either higher or lower than in analogous deterministic models, depending on the details of the density dependent recruitment function, if stage-structure is also included in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Conrad|first2=Jon M.|date=2015-11-01|title=Optimal escapement in stage-structured fisheries with environmental stochasticity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556415001753?np=y&amp;npKey=61e2ba84d62d6ab3316edbcaf02be9915419c89c51d6d0bdd1d49e9d1b8c7355|journal=Mathematical Biosciences|volume=269|pages=76â85|doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2015.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implications of MSY model ===
Starting to harvest a previously unharvested population will always lead to a decrease in the population size.   That is, it is impossible for a harvested population to remain at its original carrying capacity.  Instead, the population will either stabilize at a new lower equilibrium size or, if the harvesting rate is too high, decline to zero.

The reason why populations can be sustainably harvested is that they exhibit a density-dependent response.&lt;ref name="Jennings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt; This means that at any population size below K, the population is producing a surplus yield that is available for harvesting without reducing population size. Density dependence is the regulator process that allows the population to return to equilibrium after a perturbation.  The logistic equation assumes that density dependence takes the form of negative feedback.&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;

If a constant number of individuals is harvested from a population at a level greater than the MSY, the population will decline to extinction.  Harvesting below the MSY level leads to a stable equilibrium population if the starting population is above the unstable equilibrium population size.

=== Uses of MSY ===
MSY has been especially influential in the management of renewable biological resources such as commercially important fish and wildlife.  In fisheries terms, '''maximum sustainable yield''' (MSY) is the largest average catch that can be captured from a stock under existing environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council (NRC). 1998. Improving Fish Stock Assessments. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; MSY aims at a balance between too much and too little harvest to keep the population at some intermediate abundance with a maximum replacement rate.

Relating to MSY, the [[maximum economic yield]] (MEY) is the level of catch that provides the maximum net economic benefits or profits to society.&lt;ref&gt;Clark 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). 1996. OUr Living Oceans: Report on the Status of U.S. Living Marine Resources 1995. NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS0F/SPO-19. NMFS, Silver Springs, Md.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[optimum sustainable yield]], MEY is usually less than MSY.

=== Limitations of MSY approach ===
Although it is widely practiced by state and federal government agencies regulating wildlife, forests, and fishing, MSY has come under heavy criticism by ecologists and others from both theoretical and practical reasons.&lt;ref name="Milner-Gulland and Mace 1998"/&gt;  The concept of maximum sustainable yield is not always easy to apply in practice.  Estimation problems arise due to poor assumptions in some models and lack of reliability of the data.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;Townsend et al 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Biologists, for example, do not always have enough data to make a clear determination of the population's size and growth rate.  Calculating the point at which a population begins to slow from competition is also very difficult.  The concept of MSY also tends to treat all individuals in the population as identical, thereby ignoring all aspects of population structure such as size or age classes and their differential rates of growth, survival, and reproduction.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

As a management goal, the static interpretation of MSY (i.e., MSY as a fixed catch that can be taken year after year) is generally not appropriate because it ignores the fact that fish populations undergo natural fluctuations (i.e., MSY treats the environment as unvarying) in abundance and will usually ultimately become severely depleted under a constant-catch strategy.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;  Thus, most fisheries scientists now interpret MSY in a more dynamic sense as the [[maximum average yield]] (MAY) obtained by applying a specific harvesting strategy to a fluctuating resource.&lt;ref name="Mace"/&gt; Or as an optimal "escapement strategy", where escapement means the amount of fish that must remain in the ocean [rather than the amount of fish that can be harvested]. An escapement strategy is often the optimal strategy for maximizing expected yield of a harvested, stochastically fluctuating population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reed|first=William J|date=1979-12-01|title=Optimal escapement levels in stochastic and deterministic harvesting models|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0095069679900147|journal=Journal of Environmental Economics and Management|volume=6|issue=4|pages=350â363|doi=10.1016/0095-0696(79)90014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the limitations of MSY, does not mean it performs worse than humans using their best intuitive judgment. Experiments using students in natural resource management classes suggest that people using their past experience, intuition, and best judgement to manage a fishery generate far less long term yield compared to a computer using an MSY calculation, even when that calculation comes from incorrect population dynamic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|date=2016-07-01|title=Human judgment vs. quantitative models for the management of ecological resources|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/15-1295/abstract|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1553â1565|doi=10.1890/15-1295|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orange roughy ====
{{see also|Orange roughy}}
An example of errors in estimating the [[population dynamics]] of a species occurred within the New Zealand [[Orange roughy]] fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the [[orange roughy]] lived a long time and had [[k-selection|bred slowly]] (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Overfishing ==
{{see also|Overfishing}}
All around the world, from the arctic to the tropics, there is a crisis in the world's fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5800/787.short sciencemag.org Worm, Boris, ''et. a;.'' "Impacts of Biodiversity Loss on Ocean Ecosystem Services," ''Science'', 3 November 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Until fairly recently it was assumed that our marine resources were limitless.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In recent years however, an accelerating decline has been observed in the productivity of many important fisheries.&lt;ref&gt;Christy and Scott 1965&lt;/ref&gt;  Fisheries which have been devastated in recent times include (but are not limited to) the great whale fisheries, the Grand Bank fisheries of the western Atlantic, and the Peruvian anchovy fishery.&lt;ref name="Clark 1973"&gt;Clark 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent assessments by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the state of the world's fisheries indicate a levelling off of landings in the 1990s, at about 100 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, Review of the State of World Marine Fishery Resources, FAO Technical Paper 335 (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the composition of global catches has changed.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  As fishers deplete larger, long-lived predatory fish species such as cod, tuna, shark, and snapper, they move down to the next level â to species that tend to be smaller, shorter-lived, and less valuable.&lt;ref name="Pauly1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pauly|first1=D.|title=Fishing Down Marine Food Webs|journal=Science|volume=279|issue=5352|year=1998|pages=860â863|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.279.5352.860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overfishing is a classic example of the [[tragedy of the commons]].&lt;ref name="Clark 1973"/&gt;

== Optimum sustainable yield ==
{{see also|Optimum sustainable yield}}
In [[population ecology]] and [[economics]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the [[Level of Effort|level of effort]] (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.
In [[environmental science]], '''optimum sustainable yield''' is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.

'''Mersenne's laws''' are [[scientific law|laws]] describing the [[frequency]] of [[oscillation]] of a stretched [[Strings (music)|string]] or [[monochord]],&lt;ref name="Jeans"/&gt; useful in [[musical tuning]] and [[musical instrument construction]]. The equation was first proposed by French mathematician and music theorist [[Marin Mersenne]] in his 1637 work ''[[TraitÃ© de l'harmonie universelle]]''.&lt;ref name="mersenne"&gt;Mersenne, Marin (1637). ''TraitÃ© de l'harmonie universelle'', {{page needed|date=October 2013}}. via the [[Bavarian State Library]]. Cited in "[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MersennesLaws.html Mersenne's Laws]", ''[[Wolfram Research|Wolfram.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mersenne's laws govern the construction and operation of [[string instruments]], such as [[piano]]s and [[harp]]s, which must accommodate the total tension force required to keep the strings at the proper pitch. Lower strings are thicker, thus having a greater [[mass]] per unit length. They typically have lower [[Tension (physics)|tension]]. Guitars are a familiar exception to this - string tensions are similar, for playability, so lower string pitch is largely achieved with increased mass per length.{{notetag|Mass is typically added by increasing cross-section area. This increases the string's force constant (k). Higher k doesn't affect pitch ''per se'', but fretting a string stretches it in addition to shortening it, and the pitch increase due to stretching is larger for higher k values. Thus ''intonation'' requires more compensation for lower strings, and (markedly) for steel vs nylon. This effect still applies to strings where mass is increased with windings, albeit to a lesser extent, because the core that supports string tension generally needs to be larger to support larger masses of winding.}} Higher-pitched strings typically are thinner, have higher tension, and may be shorter. "This result does not differ substantially from [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s, yet it is rightly known as Mersenne's law," because Mersenne physically proved their truth through experiments (while Galileo considered their proof impossible&lt;!--how does one count something that is too fast for one to see?--&gt;).&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, H.F.

:&lt;math&gt; f_0 \propto \sqrt{F}.&lt;/math&gt; (equation 27)

:&lt;math&gt;  f_0 \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu}}.&lt;/math&gt; (equation 28)

Thus, for example, all other properties of the string being equal, to make the note one octave higher (2/1) one would need either to decrease its length by half (1/2), to increase the tension to the square (4), or to decrease its mass per unit length by the inverse square (1/4).

These laws are derived from Mersenne's equation 22:&lt;ref name="Steinhaus"&gt;Steinhaus, Hugo (1999). ''Mathematical Snapshots'', {{page needed|date=October 2013}}. Dover, {{ISBN|9780486409146}}. Cited in "[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/MersennesLaws.html Mersenne's Laws]", ''[[Wolfram Research|Wolfram.com]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; f_0 = \frac{\nu}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[formula]] for the [[fundamental frequency]] is:
:&lt;math&gt; f_0=\frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''f'' is the frequency, ''L'' is the length, ''F'' is the force and ''&amp;mu;'' is the mass per unit length.

Similar laws were not developed for pipes and wind instruments at the same time since Mersenne's laws predate the conception of [[Wind instrument#Physics of sound production|wind instrument pitch]] being dependent on longitudinal waves rather than "percussion".&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9422">'''Michael Huggins''' (born 1957) is the [[American people|American]] founder and Executive Director of Transformation Yoga Project, a non-profit organization teaching [[yoga]] and mindfulness as a tool for personal change in the lives of people within [[Drug rehabilitation|drug and alcohol rehabilitation]] facilities, the criminal justice system, community transitional centers and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA hospitals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://www.transformationyogaproject.org/who-we-are-1#staff-board|website=transformationyogaproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Yoga Practice and Training ==
Huggins began practicing yoga in 2002 to counteract chronic back pain.  In 2010 he became a registered yoga teacher with a 200-Hour Level certification from Power Yoga Works recognized by [[Yoga Alliance]]. Later that year he trained with Street Yoga to teach yoga and mindfulness to at-risk youth and vulnerable populations. He has since trained at the [[Kripalu Center|Kripalu Yoga Center]], [[Omega Institute for Holistic Studies]], the Prison Yoga Project, Power Yoga Works, and other organizations to gain additional skills as a teacher, including for incarcerated populations and veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bense|first1=Michelle|title=Transformation Yoga Project Uses Yoga to Heal Addiction and Trauma|url=http://issuu.com/nabuxmont/docs/na_buxmont_june15_/20|website=issuu.com|publisher=Natural Awakenings|accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Michael Huggins|url=https://www.yogaalliance.org/TeacherPublicProfile?tid=30284|website=yogaalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Huggins studied Accounting at [[Villanova University]] and received an MBA from the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Profile: Michael Huggins|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=8295616&amp;privcapId=7407998|website=bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked as a Senior Auditor at [[Arthur Andersen]] and Co., Manager of Treasury Operations for [[Kenner Products|Kenner Parker Toys]], Vice President of Administration for Town &amp; County Corp., CFO/COO for Spectra Science, President and COO for [[Synthes|Synthes, Inc.]], CEO for Scientâx, and most recently as a Consultant for MDH Advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scient'x, S.A.

== Incarceration ==
In July 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice charged [[Synthes]] and a subsidiary with various offenses relating to a bone cement regulated by the federal government as a medical device.  The government also charged four company executives, including Michael Huggins, with a strict liability misdemeanor offense.  After pleading guilty to the strict liability misdemeanor charge, Huggins was sentenced in November 2011 to a nine-month prison term, a $100,000 fine, and three months of supervised release following his release from custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judgment in a Criminal Case|url=http://www.circare.org/lex/09cr00403_judghug_20111121.pdf|website=circare.org|accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transformation Yoga Project ==
In 2010, Huggins began working with community organizations to provide yoga to at-risk youth, and as after-school programming for young people. During his first weeks in prison Huggins began teaching yoga and [[guided meditation]] to his fellow inmates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huggins|first1=Michael|title=Back to Basics: Yoga in Prison|url=http://www.phillyareayoga.com/back-to-basics-a-yogis-view-from-prison/|website=phillyareayoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of his teaching spurred him to train fellow inmates as teachers also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bense|first1=Michelle|title=Transformation Yoga Project Uses Yoga to Heal Addiction and Trauma|url=http://issuu.com/nabuxmont/docs/na_buxmont_june15_/20|website=issuu.com|publisher=Natural Awakenings|accessdate=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release from prison, Huggins attended a Prison Yoga Project training course and soon after began returning to prisons as a volunteer yoga instructor. Huggins found that yoga could be a therapy and build emotional tools against the traumas of living in prison as well as the traumas that came before incarceration, such as [[homelessness]], [[Addiction|drug abuse]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pence|first1=Mary|title=Why Teach Yoga to Prisoners?|url=http://www.maryspence.org/blog/2015/06/04/why-teach-yoga-to-prisoners/|website=maryspence.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Michael|first1 = Huggins|url = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCW26WAmaB0Dkw9x45O635w|website = youtube.com|title = Transformation Yoga Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Huggins founded Transformation Yoga Project as a non-profit organization with a mission to train and provide teachers with yoga and mindfulness techniques that specifically support people with traumatic or addictive backgrounds in an effort to heal, build emotional stability, and reduce the stresses of imprisoned, rehabilitative, post-traumatic, or transitional living circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga for Trauma and Addiction â Teacher Training From Transformation Yoga Project|url=http://www.phillyareayoga.com/event/yoga-for-trauma-and-addiction-teacher-training-from-transformation-yoga-project/|website=phillyareayoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformation Yoga Project encourages the yoga teachers it trains to embrace [[Selfless service|seva]], the religious concept of serving selflessly. The goals of Transformation Yoga Project include curbing recidivism rates by enabling inmates to heal, develop greater maturity, and create positive growth for themselves. Many within prison administrations embrace yoga and mindfulness programs because of the benefits to the inmate populations during and after incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga for Trauma and Addiction â Teacher Training From Transformation Yoga Project|url=http://www.phillyareayoga.com/event/yoga-for-trauma-and-addiction-teacher-training-from-transformation-yoga-project/|website=phillyareayoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schware|first1=Rob|title=Transforming Yoga: Healing Through Empowerment In Prisons And Drug Rehabilitation Facilities|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rob-schware/transforming-yoga-healing_b_6141496.html|website=huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke-Fields|first1=Hunter|title=Prison Yoga Transformation with Mike Huggins|url=http://www.hunteryoga.com/blog/024-prison-yoga/|website=hunteryoga.com|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transformation Yoga Project runs programs in numerous facilities including at the [[State Correctional Institution â Graterford|State Correctional Institute at Graterford]], the [[Philadelphia Prison System|Philadelphia Prison Systemâs Cambria Community Center]], the Montgomery County Youth Detention Center, the Montgomery County Youth Shelter, the Delaware County Juvenile Detention Center, the [[Federal Detention Center, Philadelphia|Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia]], the [[Institute of the Pennsylvania Hospital|Kirkbride Center for recovery]], [[State Correctional Institution â Chester|Gaudenzia house]], the Divine Light Recovery House, the ODDAT Synergy House, and at the Veterans Hospital in Coatesville, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoga for Recovery|url=http://www.transformationyogaproject.org/who-we-serve-1#yoga-for-recovery|website=transformationyogaproject.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other ==
Huggins works with several non-profit organizations in a variety of capacities, including sharing yoga with at-risk and traumatized populations throughout the country. He has partnered with Prison Yoga Project to train yoga teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philadelphia Training|url=http://prisonyoga.org/trainings/philadelphia-training/|website=prisonyoga.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sits on the Board of Directors of Liberation Prison Yoga, a non-profit organization founded by [[Anneke Lucas]], to prepare yoga teachers with trauma-conscious methods for incarcerated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://www.liberationprisonyoga.com/who-we-are/|website=liberationprisonyoga.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also volunteered with the [[United Way]] of Chester County and Open Hearth where he taught career development workshops for the underprivileged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chester County Leadership Connection Alumni Directory|url=http://www.leadershipchestercounty.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2010_cclc_directory.pdf|website=leadershipchestercounty.org|accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7084">In mathematics, '''monus''' is an operator on certain [[commutative property|commutative]] [[monoid#Commutative monoid|monoid]]s that are not [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. A commutative monoid on which a monus operator is defined is called a '''commutative monoid with monus''', or '''CMM'''. The monus operator may be denoted with the '''&amp;minus;''' symbol because the [[natural number]]s are a CMM under [[subtraction]]; it is also denoted with the '''â¸''' symbol to distinguish it from the standard subtraction operator.

|}

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;(M, +, 0)&lt;/math&gt; be a commutative [[monoid]]. Define a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; on this monoid as follows: for any two elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, we set &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists another element &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a + c = b&lt;/math&gt;. It is easy to check that &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] (taking &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; to be the [[neutral element]] of the monoid) and that it is [[transitive relation|transitive]] (if &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; with witness &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \leq c&lt;/math&gt; with witness &lt;math&gt;d'&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;d + d'&lt;/math&gt; witnesses that &lt;math&gt;a \leq c&lt;/math&gt;). We call &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; ''naturally ordered'' if the &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; relation is additionally [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], so that &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial order]]. Further, if for each pair of elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique smallest element &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \leq b + c&lt;/math&gt;, then we call {{math|''M''}} a ''commutative monoid with monus''&lt;ref name="Amer"&gt;
  {{citation
    |last=Amer
    |first=K.
    |title=Equationally complete classes of commutative monoids with monus
    |journal=Algebra Universalis
    |year=1984
    |doi=10.1007/BF01182254
    |volume=18
    |pages=129&amp;ndash;131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}}
and we can then define the ''monus'' {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;â¸&amp;nbsp;''b''}} of any two elements &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; as this unique smallest element &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a \leq b + c&lt;/math&gt;.

An example of a commutative monoid which is not naturally ordered is &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}, +, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, the commutative monoid of the [[integer]]s with usual [[addition]], as for any &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; there exists &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a + c = b&lt;/math&gt;, so we have &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;a, b \in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is not a partial order. There are also examples of monoids which are naturally ordered but are not semirings with monus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1968090 math.SE answer]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other structures ==

Beyond monoids, the notion of monus can be applied to other structures. For instance, a '''naturally ordered semiring''' (sometimes called a '''dioid'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://marcpouly.ch/pdf/internal_100712.pdf Semirings for breakfast], slide 17&lt;/ref&gt;) is a semiring where the commutative monoid induced by the addition operator is naturally ordered. When this monoid is a commutative monoid with monus, the semiring is called a '''semiring with monus''', or '''m-semiring'''.

== Examples ==
If {{math|''M''}} is an [[Semigroup#Subsemigroups and ideals|ideal]] in a [[Boolean algebra]], then {{math|''M''}} is a commutative monoid with monus under {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#61;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;â¨&amp;nbsp;''b''}} and {{math|''a''&amp;nbsp;â¸&amp;nbsp;b&amp;nbsp;&amp;#61;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;â§&amp;nbsp;Â¬''b''}}.&lt;ref name="Amer" /&gt;{{rp|129}}

=== Natural numbers ===
The [[natural number]]s including 0 form a commutative monoid with monus, with their ordering being the usual order of natural numbers and the monus operator being a [[Saturation arithmetic|saturating]] variant of standard subtraction, variously referred to as '''truncated subtraction''',&lt;ref name="Computable Functions"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Truncated subtraction is usually defined as&lt;ref name="Computable Functions" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a \mathop {\dot -} b =
\begin{cases}
0 &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; b \\
a - b &amp; \mbox{if } a \ge b,
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &amp;minus; denotes standard [[subtraction]]. For example, 5 &amp;minus; 3 = 2 and 3 &amp;minus; 5 = &amp;minus;2 in regular subtraction, whereas in truncated subtraction 3 â¸ 5 = 0. Truncated subtraction may also be defined as&lt;ref name="Wirsing" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a \mathop {\dot -} b = \max(a - b, 0).&lt;/math&gt;

In [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]], truncated subtraction is defined in terms of the predecessor function {{math|''P''}} (the inverse of the [[successor function]]):&lt;ref name="Computable Functions" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P(0)    &amp;= 0 \\
P(S(a)) &amp;= a \\
a \mathop {\dot -} 0 &amp;= a \\
a \mathop {\dot -} S(b) &amp;= P(a \mathop {\dot -} b).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Truncated subtraction is useful in contexts such as [[primitive recursive function]]s, which are not defined over negative numbers.&lt;ref name="Computable Functions" /&gt; Truncated subtraction is also used in the definition of the [[multiset#Multiplicity function|multiset]] [[set difference|difference]] operator.

== Properties ==
The class of all commutative monoids with monus form a [[algebraic variety|variety]].&lt;ref name="Amer" /&gt;{{rp|129}} The equational basis for the variety of all CMMs consists of the axioms for [[monoid#Commutative monoid|commutative monoids]], as well as the following axioms:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a + (b \dot - a) &amp;= b + (a \dot - b) \\
(a \dot - b) \dot - c &amp;= a \dot - (b + c) \\
(a \dot - a) &amp;= 0 \\
(0 \dot - a) &amp;= 0. \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

In [[object-oriented programming]], the '''open/closed principle''' states "''software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification''";&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its [[source code]].

The name ''open/closed principle'' has been used in two ways. Both ways use generalizations (for instance, [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] or delegate functions) to resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.

==Meyer's open/closed principle==
[[Bertrand Meyer]] is generally credited for having originated the term ''open/closed principle'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Martin]] [http://docs.google.com/a/cleancoder.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0BwhCYaYDn8EgN2M5MTkwM2EtNWFkZC00ZTI3LWFjZTUtNTFhZGZiYmUzODc1&amp;hl=en "The Open-Closed Principle", &lt;cite&gt;C++ Report&lt;/cite&gt;, January 1996, pp. 1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822033314/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in his 1988 book &lt;cite&gt;''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction|Object Oriented Software Construction]]''&lt;/cite&gt;. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
* A module will be said to be open if it is still available for extension. For example, it should be possible to add fields to the data structures it contains, or new elements to the set of functions it performs.
* A module will be said to be closed if [it] is available for use by other modules. This assumes that the module has been given a well-defined, stable description (the interface in the sense of information hiding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Object-oriented software construction|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0136290493|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

At the time Meyer was writing, adding fields or functions to a library inevitably required changes to any programs depending on that library. Meyer's proposed solution to this dilemma relied on the notion of object-oriented [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] (specifically [[implementation inheritance]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
A class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined, and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Object-oriented software construction|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0136290493|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Polymorphic open/closed principle==
During the 1990s, the open/closed principle became popularly redefined to refer to the use of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstracted]] interfaces, where the implementations can be changed and multiple implementations could be created and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphically]] substituted for each other.

In contrast to Meyer's usage, this definition advocates inheritance from [[abstract base class]]es. Interface specifications can be reused through inheritance but implementation need not be. The existing interface is closed to modifications and new implementations must, at a minimum, implement that interface.

[[Robert C. Martin]]'s 1996 article "The Open-Closed Principle"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Martin]] [http://docs.google.com/a/cleancoder.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0BwhCYaYDn8EgN2M5MTkwM2EtNWFkZC00ZTI3LWFjZTUtNTFhZGZiYmUzODc1&amp;hl=en "The Open-Closed Principle", &lt;cite&gt;C++ Report&lt;/cite&gt;, January 1996] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822033314/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the seminal writings to take this approach. In 2001 [[Craig Larman]] related the open/closed principle to the pattern by [[Alistair Cockburn]] called ''Protected Variations'', and to the [[David Parnas]] discussion of ''[[information hiding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Larman, "Protected Variation: The Importance of Being Closed", &lt;cite&gt;IEEE Software&lt;/cite&gt; May/June 2001, pp. 89-91 ''[http://codecourse.sourceforge.net/materials/The-Importance-of-Being-Closed.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polak Model''' is a [[Monetarism|monetary]] approach to the balance of payment published by [[Jacques J. Polak|J. J. Polak]] in 1957. It seeks to model a small, open economy operating under [[Fixed exchange-rate system|fixed nominal exchange rate]]. Polak suggest explicit links between the monetary and external sectors. Polak results continue to form the theoretical bases on which the IMF Financial Programming are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Tarp, F. (1994)  Chapter 3 âFinancial Programming and Stabilizationâ, from Stabilization and Structural Adjustment: Macroeconomic Frameworks for Analyzing the Crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. p. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polak Model is based on the following four equations:

M&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;v = Y

Z = mY

âM&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; =âR + âDC

âR = X - Z + âF

Where Md is the demand for money, v is the [[velocity of money]] (here considered constant), Y is the [[GDP|output]], Z is the [[imports]], m is the [[marginal propensity to import]], Ms is the [[money supply]], R is the amount of [[foreign reserves]], DC is the Domestic Credit, X is [[exports]] and F are other net [[foreign currency]] flows.

In the model the following variables are seen as [[exogenous]]:&lt;ref&gt;Tarp, F. (1994)  Chapter 3 âFinancial Programming and Stabilizationâ, from Stabilization and Structural Adjustment: Macroeconomic Frameworks for Analyzing the Crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Real GDP|Real Output]] (y), [[Exports]] (X), other [[foreign currency]] inflows (âF)
âF = NTR - INT - âNFA

They have to be projected during the IMF Financial Programming exercise in order to set the desired levels for the target variables which are:

[[International reserves|Level of International Reserves]] (R)
[[Inflation]], of change in price for the [[Domestic market|domestic sector]] (âP&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) and,
[[Credit (finance)|Credit]] extended to the privet sector (âDC&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;)

The model also assumes that sooner or later the market will clear meaning that [[Money demand|demand]] and [[supply of money]] will equal, or:

âM&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = âM&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

'''Postural Integration''' is a process-oriented [[Body psychotherapy|body-based therapy]] originally developed in the late 1960s by Jack Painter&lt;ref&gt;Ziehl, Silke: [http://icpit.org/jack-w-painter/ Recalling Jack Painter]&lt;/ref&gt; (1933â2010) in California, US, after exploration in the fields of [[humanistic psychology]] and the [[Human Potential Movement|human potential movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Erken, Rita and Schlage, Bernhard: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' with Bodymind Integration'' &lt;br&gt;Postural Integration â Energetic Integration â Psychotherapeutic Postural Integration; &lt;br&gt;Articles by 14 international authors; Hubert W. Holzinger Verlag, Berlin (2012)  {{ISBN|978-3-926396-67-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method aims to support [[Self-efficacy|personal change]] and [[Personal Development|self development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icpit.info/articles/J_Painter_PosturalIntegration 1985_.pdf Painter, Jack: ''Postural Integration, Transformation of the Whole Self'' (1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Deep Bodywork and Personal Development: Harmonizing Our Bodies, Emotions, and Thoughts;'' Bodymind Books, Mill Valley, Calif., {{ISBN|0938405012}} (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Technical Manual of Deep Wholistic Bodywork'', Postural Integration; published by &lt;br&gt;The International Centre for Release and Integration, Mill Valley, Calif. US (1984) (2nd edit. 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
During his time as Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Miami]], Painter became interested in working with the body and personally explored many different approaches â [[massage]], [[acupuncture]], [[Zen]], [[yoga]], the work of [[Ida Rolf]] and her [[Rolfing]] method,&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar&gt;Ben-Shahar, Asaf Rolef: ''Touching the Relational Edge; Body Psychotherapy'' A Roadmap to Body Psychotherapy modalities, &lt;br&gt; \PI defined: pp.43-44, Karnac Books Ltd., London (2014) {{ISBN|978-1-7822009-4-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gestalt therapy]] developed by [[Fritz Perls]], and the theories of [[Wilhelm Reich]] in the form of [[Vegetotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cascone, Raffaele in: Erken &amp; Schlage: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' ''; ''Biology, psychotherapy &amp; somatic ecology'' p.68. &lt;/ref&gt;

By the seventies he was calling his form of holistic [[bodymind]] bodywork 'Postural Integration'.&lt;ref&gt;Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erken, Rita and Schlage, Bernhard: Editors: ''Transformation of '''the Self''' with Bodymind Integration''&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighties and nineties Painter then went on to develop two further methods, Energetic Integration&lt;ref&gt;[http://icpit.org/energetic-integration/ Energetic Integration]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Deborah Anapol#Pelvic-Heart Integration|Pelvic-Heart Integration]].

==In practise==
In the course of a twelve-session series&lt;ref name= "Knaster"/&gt; modeled loosely on [[Rolfing|Rolfing Structural Integration]], the Postural Integration process integrates [[Gestalt therapy]] with [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]],&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar/&gt; as well as [[Breathwork|breath work]], [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|fine energy]] work and elements from the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Jack: ''Technical Manual of Deep Wholistic Bodywork'' (1984), 'Five Element Associations' pp.54-57 &lt;/ref&gt; The initial seven sessions address specific body areas and focus on releasing defensive armoring habits, characterized as "letting go of the old self".&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Press|Bantam]] |pages= 205â6 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt; During sessions, spontaneous [[emotional expression]] is encouraged. Additional tools include [[drama therapy]], attention to [[body language]]&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Shahar, Asaf Rolef: Ch.VII The Language of the Body pp.151-187&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Self-awareness#In psychology|self-awareness]].&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar/&gt;

Since Postural Integration works simultaneously with the physical, mental and emotional aspects of the whole person, &lt;ref&gt;The Free Dictionary: ''Segen's Medical Dictionary'', ''Postural Integration'': [https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/postural+integration the technique works simultaneously with the physical, mental and emotional aspects of the whole person.] [http://www.farlex.com Farlex, Inc Â© 2012] &lt;/ref&gt; it contains elements of both psychotherapy and bodywork, some practitioners qualified in psychotherapy focus more on the therapy aspect while others use it primarily as a form of bodywork with psychotherapy-based awareness and insights.&lt;ref name = Ben-Shahar/&gt;

Postural Integration is taught and practised mainly in Europe, and also in US, Mexico &lt;ref&gt;Sevilla, Rosa MarÃ­a (IntegraciÃ³n Postural): p.114 in Lachica, Fernando Ortiz: ''Psicoterapia corporal'' Bases teÃ³ricas de la prÃ¡ctica, Painter, Jack (Postural Integration) pp. 3, 17, 62, 92, 114, 115, 138, 169, Universidad AutÃ³noma Metropolitana, Mexico (2016), {{ISBN|978-607-9472-27-6}}. &lt;/ref&gt; and South Africa. 

Postural Integration trainings are organized by the International Council of PsychoCorporal (Bodymind) Integration Trainers (ICPIT).

In the 1990s Postural Integrational Psychotherapy (PIP) developed in Europe out of Postural Integration with the inclusion of [[Analytical psychology|Jungian psychology]], and was acknowledged by the [[European Association for Body Psychotherapy]] as a method of [[Body psychotherapy]] provided the practitioner is also a qualified [[psychotherapist]].

'''Pratyaksha''' is one of the three principal means of knowledge, it means that which is present before the eyes clear, distinct and evident.

==Meaning==
'''PRATYKSHA &amp; Pratyaksha Both are different Meaning (à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯à¤à¥à¤·à¤¾ &amp;  à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯à¤à¥à¤·)'''

'''Pratyaksha''' ([[Sanskrit]]: à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯à¤à¥à¤· [[IAST]]: pratyaká¹£a) literally means that which is perceptible to the eye or visible, in general usage it refers to being present, present before the eye i.e. within the range of sight, cognizable by any sense organ, distinct, evident, clear, direct, immediate, explicit, express, corporeal; it is a Pramana, mode of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=185|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.238764}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyaya]] School recognizes ''Pratyaksha'' (perception) as a kind of ''[[pramana]]'' along with ''[[Anumana]]'' (inference), ''Upamana'' (comparison) and [[Shabda]] (verbal testimony); this school recognizes these four kinds only. The [[Sankhya]] School does not recognize ''Upamana'' as a ''pramana''.  To these four auxiliaries which help illuminate things the [[Vedantins]] and the Mimamsakas also add ''[[Anupalabdhi]]'' (non-apprehension) and ''Arthapatti'' (presumption)as valid ''pramanas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=The Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Means of knowledge==

''Pratyaksha'' is one of the three principal means of knowledge. The three principal means of knowledge are â 1) ''Anumana'', inference from data, which depends for its value on the possession of the right data, on the right observation of the data including the drawing of the right analogies, the unerring perception of true identity and rejection of false identity, the just estimate of difference and contrast, and on the power of right reasoning from the right data; 2) ''Pratyaksha'' which is the process of collecting and knowing the data, and 3) ''Aptavakya'' which is evidence, the testimony of men in possession of the sought after knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publications|page=337|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=f4XsuPPjQlIC&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VhfGU_CONZK2uASs-YEI&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

''Pratyaksha'' refers to the faculties of perception with which are connected thoughts (''[[Chinta (mentation)|Chinta]]''), imagination (''Kalpana'') and volition (''Praytna''), which four together as ''Chetas'' illuminate the ''[[Mind|Manas]]'', the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, and give awareness or consciousness (''Chetna'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Encyclopaedia|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publications|page=5839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SDh2WjvLo7gC&amp;pg=PA5839&amp;dq=chinta+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wtRHU6LbFMaxrgfM94HAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=chinta%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are four types of valid perceptions â a) ''Indriya pratyaksha'' or sense perception, b) ''Manas pratyaksha'' or mental perception, c) ''Svavedana pratyaksha'' or self-consciousness, and d) ''Yoga pratyaksha'' or super normal intuition. In sense perception, which is an indeterminate perception the ''chittashakti'' (intelligence-energy) acts as the substratum of the senses. Mental perception arises when ''chittashakti'', with the aid of ''[[Buddhi]]'', reflects upon objects of senses, and is a determinate perception. Self-consciousness arises when, directed by the ''[[tattvas]]'' or ''panchakoshas'', ''raga'' (attachment), ''vidya'' (knowledge), ''niyati'' (order of things), ''kala'' (time) and ''kalpa'' (the elements) along with pleasure and pain become objects of knowledge to chit, the intelligence of the self. Super normal intuition is gained after removal of impurities cover the intelligent-self through practice of the eight-fold yogic-discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|author=Mohan Lal|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|pages=3957â3958|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KnPoYxrRfc0C&amp;pg=PA3958&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4vXFU8zQFYSGuATJ0YD4BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pratyaksha'' knowledge can be gained through a) Worldly pratyaksha, externally through the five senses and internally through mind, and b) Transcendental ''pratyaksha'' which is divided into ''Samanya'', ''Lakshana'', ''Gyana lakshana'' and ''Yogaja''. ''Pratyaksha''  (apparent  or obvious) is divided into ''[[Savikalpa]]'', ''[[Nirvikalpa]]'' and ''Pratibhigya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Indology|author=Vishnulok Bihari Shrivastava|publisher=Pustak Mahal|page=209|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eaCbv1NcbHwC&amp;pg=PT209&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4vXFU8zQFYSGuATJ0YD4BA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pratyaksha'' knowledge is intuitive in nature and in [[Yoga]] and [[Vedanta]] is also known as [[Aparokshanubhuti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology in India Vol.3|author=Girishwar Misra|publisher=Pearson Education India|page=107|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fXQzo7LGfuIC&amp;pg=PA107&amp;dq=pratyaksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lgHGU6XVC9OMuATrn4CYCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=pratyaksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{canon law}}
'''Presumption in the [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' of the Catholic Church is a term signifying a reasonable conjecture concerning something doubtful,&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; drawn from arguments and appearances, which by the force of circumstances can be accepted as a proof. It is on this presumption our common adage is based: "Possession is nine points of the law". Presumption has its place in canon law only when positive proofs are wanting, and yet the formulation of some judgment is necessary. It is never in itself an absolute proof, as it only presumes that something is true. Canonists divide presumption into:
#presumption of law (''juris''), or that which is deduced from some legal precept or authority expressed in law or based upon precedents or similarities, and
#presumption of a judge or man (''judicis'' or ''hominis''), when the law is silent on the subject and an opinion must be formed according to the way that circumstances and indications would affect a prudent man or judge.

==Canon 1584==
{{main|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
Canon 1584 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] defines the current [[canonical jurisprudence]] around presumption:
{{quote|A presumption is a probable conjecture about an uncertain matter; one is a presumption of law, which is established by the law itself; another is human, which is formulated by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;Coriden, ''The Code of Canon Law'', canon 1584 (pg. 988).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This canon of the 1983 Code removes the distinction between relative and absolute legal presumption that was present in the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;

==Varieties of presumption==
There are several sub-varieties of presumption of law. The foundation of these legal presumptions is to be sought in the natural conclusions drawn from the ordinary happenings of common life and the consideration of the motives that usually sway men in given circumstances. The general rules are thus formulated: "What is natural is presumed to be in the person or case in question"; "Change is not to be presumed"; "Presumption is to be formed from the favourable side". As to effects, when there is question of presumption ''juris,'' it abstracts from the necessity of proof; not so presumption ''hominis.'' A judge can follow the first in civil cases even when doubt remains, not so the second. The former places the burden of proof on the adversary, but the latter does not. Finally, the first is considered of itself equivalent to proof, while the second needs corroboration from something extraneous to itself.

==''Presumptio juris''==
A legal presumption (''presumptio juris''&lt;ref name=Manual395&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 395.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a presumption that is stated in the positive canon law (''ab ipsa lege''&lt;ref name=Coriden988&gt;Coriden, ''The Code of Canon Law'', pg. 988 (commentary on canon 1584).&lt;/ref&gt;). Under the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]],&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; legal presumption was divided into two kinds:&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; ''juris tantum'' "which is relative and vincible by both direct and indirect proof to the contrary",&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; and ''juris et de jure'' or absolute presumption which can only be refuted by indirect proof (undermining the fact(s) upon which the presumption is based).&lt;ref name=Manual395/&gt; This distinction between the subdivisions of legal presumption, the relative (''juris simpliciter''&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;) and the absolute&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; (''juris et de jure'') was not continued into the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]] and was dropped.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;

===''Juris tantum''===
Thus, it is called presumption of law alone (''juris tantum'') when a thing is judged to be so until the contrary is proved. Hence the legal formulÃ¦: [[Presumption of innocence|"Everyone is presumed innocent until his guilt is proved"]]; "Once bad always bad" (i. e. in the same species of ill-doing, if amendment is not certain); "What is known in a remote place is known in a neighbouring place", and others similar.

===''Juris et de jure''===
It is denominated presumption ''juris et de jure,'' when the law so strongly supports the presumption that it is held to be certain in judicial proceedings. Against such a presumption no proofs are admitted except the evident truth. Thus, goods described in the inventory made by a guardian are presumed to belong to the possessions of the deceased, nor would the later testimony of the guardian himself to the contrary ordinarily be admitted.

==''Presumptio juris naturalis''==
Natural presumptions (''presumptiones juris naturales'') fall under the definition of ''presumptio hominis''. According to a generally held opinion of canonists, "presumptions ''hominis'' and ''naturae'' are, in as far as they are moral, in contrast to presumptions ''juris'' or legal presumptions."&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 396,&lt;br&gt;citing Augustine, ''A Commentary on the New Code of Canon Law, Vol. VII'' (St. Louis: 1923), pg. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumptions of the [[natural law]] are those presumptions that are not stated in the positive canon law, and as such do not constitute ''legal'' presumptions.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; Some presumptions of the natural law have been incorporated into the ''[[RegulÃ¦ Juris|Rules of Law]]''.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt; Sometimes judges use natural law presumptions as their basis for judicial presumptions.&lt;ref name=Coriden988/&gt;

===''Judicis'' or ''hominis''===
As to the presumption ''judicis'' or ''hominis'', it is denoted by the following:
#It is called ''vehement,'' when the probability is very strongly supported by most urgent conjectures. Thus, a birth would be held illegitimate, which took place eleven months after a husband's decease. A vehement presumption is considered equivalent to a full proof in civil causes of not too great importance. As to whether it should have sufficient effect in criminal causes to produce the condemnation of an accused person, canonists do not agree.
#It is termed ''probable,'' when it arises from less urgent and only less probable conjectures and indications. Such presumption is looked on as merely a semi-proof, unless it be sustained by public rumour, in which case it is held as sufficient proof. 
#Finally, it is denominated ''rash,'' or ''temerarious,'' if it rests on insufficient conjectures or scarcely probable arguments. Such presumption is to be entirely rejected as a proof.

The '''Queen Charlotte Islands caribou''' or '''Dawson's caribou''' (''Rangifer tarandus dawsoni'') is an [[extinct]] [[subspecies]] of the [[Reindeer|reindeer]] (or the caribou in [[North America]]) that once lived on [[Graham Island]], the largest of the [[Haida Gwaii]] islands in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Possible causes of extinction include [[habitat destruction]], introduced disease and [[hunting|overhunting]]. It was gray in appearance. The last three caribou were killed in 1908 and can be seen at the [[Royal British Columbia Museum]], where their pelts and bones are preserved and displayed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speciesatrisk.bc.ca/node/7955 Dawson Caribou] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407124051/http://www.speciesatrisk.bc.ca/node/7955 |date=2014-04-07 }}, Species at Risk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/nd07/indepth/peary_caribou.asp|title=Caribou in Canada|publisher=Canadian Geographic|date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent analysis of [[mtDNA]] suggests that the Queen Charlotte Islands caribou was not genetically distinct from the subspecies from the Canadian mainland.&lt;ref&gt;Byun, S.A.; B.F.

The '''race to the bottom''' is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] phrase which is used to describe government [[deregulation]] of the business environment, or reduction in tax rates, in order to attract or retain economic activity in their jurisdictions. An outcome of [[globalization]] and [[free trade]], the phenomenon may occur when competition increases between geographic areas over a particular sector of trade and production.&lt;ref name="Economist 2013"&gt;{{cite news|author1=C.W.|title=Racing to the bottom |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/11/labour-standards |accessdate=15 March 2016|work=[[The Economist]] |date=27 November 2013 |quote=But the race to the bottom operates more subtly than most people suppose. The regressions suggest that while countries do compete with each other by instituting laws that are unfriendly to workers, such competition is not that pronounced. The real problem is that countries compete by enforcing labour laws less vigorously than they mightâleading to increases in violations of labour rights prescribed in local laws. Competition between countries to attract investment is less in rules than in their practical application.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principal effect and intent of these actions is to make labor rates "more competitive" (i.e. lower), the principal cost of business, together with other factors (pensions, environmental protection and other [[externalities]]),  and thus the metaphor where the bottom is the lowest wage that can be paid for that labor.

==History and usage==
The concept of a regulatory "race to the bottom" emerged in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th century, when there was charter competition among states to attract corporations to domicile in their jurisdiction. Some described the concept as the "race to efficiency", and others, such as Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], as the "race to the bottom".&lt;ref name = "coined" /&gt;

In the late 19th century, [[joint-stock company]] control was being liberalised in Europe, where countries were engaged in competitive liberal legislation to allow local companies to compete. This liberalization reached Spain in 1869, Germany in 1870, Belgium in 1873, and Italy in 1883. In 1890, [[New Jersey]] enacted a liberal corporation charter, which charged low fees for company registration and lower [[franchise tax]]es than other states. [[Delaware]] attempted to [[Delaware corporation|copy the law to attract companies]] to its own state. This competition ended when Governor [[Woodrow Wilson]] tightened New Jersey's laws through a series of seven statutes.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg NJ Del."&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robert E. Wright|title=How Delaware Became the King of U.S. Corporate Charters|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2012-06-08/how-delaware-became-the-king-of-u-s-corporate-charters|accessdate=15 March 2016| work=Bloomberg View |date=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In academic literature, the phenomenon of regulatory competition reducing standards overall was argued for by A.A. Berle and G.C. Means in ''[[The Modern Corporation and Private Property]]'' (1932), while the concept received formal recognition by the [[US Supreme Court]] in a decision of Justice [[Louis Brandeis]] in the 1933 case ''[[Ligget Co. v. Lee]]'' (288 U.S. 517, 558â559).&lt;ref name = "coined"&gt;{{cite book| last =Meisel| first =Nicolas| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2004| title =Governance Culture and Development: A Different Perspective on Corporate Governance | publisher =Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development| location =| isbn = 92-64-01727-5 }} p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ind"&gt;{{cite book| last =Kelly| first =John E.| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2002| title =Industrial Relations: critical perspectives on business and management | publisher =Routledge| location =UK| isbn = 0-415-22986-3 }} p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "sch"&gt;{{cite book| last =Schram| first =Sanford F.| authorlink =| coauthors =| year =2000| title =After Welfare: The Culture of Postindustrial Social Policy | publisher =NYU Press| location =| isbn = 0-8147-9755-5 }} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandeis's "race to the bottom" metaphor was updated in 1974 by [[William L. Cary|William Cary]], in an article in the [[Yale Law Journal]], "Federalism and Corporate Law: Reflections Upon Delaware," in which Carey argued for the imposition of national standards for [[corporate governance]].

Sanford F. Schram explained in 2000 that the term "race to the bottom":

{{cquote|...has for some time served as an important metaphor to illustrate that the United States federal systemâand every federal system for that matterâis vulnerable to interstate competition. The "race to the bottom" implies that the states compete with each other as each tries to underbid the others in lowering taxes, spending, regulation...so as to make itself more attractive to outside financial interests or unattractive to unwanted outsiders. It can be opposed to the alternative metaphor of "[[Laboratories of democracy|Laboratories of Democracy]]". The laboratory metaphor implies a more sanguine federalism in which [states] use their authority and discretion to develop innovative and creative solutions to common problems which can be then adopted by other states.&lt;ref name = "sch" /&gt;}}

The term has also been used to describe a similar type of competition between corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.popularresistance.org/walmart-creates-a-race-to-the-bottom-throughout-the-supplyline/ |work=Popular Resistance |author=Charles Fishman |date=November 27, 2013 |title=Walmart Creates A Race To The Bottom Throughout The Economy}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/24/taskrabbit-uber-economy_n_6538540.html |work=Huffington Post |author=Alexis Kleinman |date=Jan 24, 2015 |title=How The Uber Economy Can Become A Race To The Bottom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, in response to reports that British supermarkets had cut the price of [[banana]]s, and by implication had squeezed revenues of banana-growing developing nations, Alistair Smith, international co-coordinator of Banana Link, said "The British supermarkets are leading a race to the bottom. Jobs are being lost and producers are having to pay less attention to social and environmental agreements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=N/A |newspaper=[[The Times]] |department=Business Section |date=7 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Another example is the cruise industry, which registers its ship with flags of convenience, circumventing wage requirements, and other expenses required by developed countries, thus providing the business model for the industry.&lt;ref name="Cruise Ships"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Elizabeth Becker|title=Destination Nowhere: The Dark Side of the Cruise Industry|url=http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2014/04/17/health-and-family/travel/the-dark-side-of-the-cruise-ship-industry.html|accessdate=15 March 2016 |work=The Saturday Evening Post |date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has also been used in the context of a trend for some European states to seize refugees' assets.&lt;ref name="Newsweek Refugees"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Josh Lowe|title=U.N. Slams 'Race To The Bottom' On Refugee Cash |url=http://www.newsweek.com/un-slams-race-bottom-refugee-cash-denmark-germany-switzerland-418278 |accessdate=15 March 2016| work=Newsweek |date=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental policy ==
The race to the bottom has been a tactic widely used among states within the United States of America. The race to the bottom in environmental policy involves both scaling back policies already in place and passing new policies that encourage less environmentally friendly behavior. Some states use this as an economic development strategy, especially in times of financial hardship.  For example, in Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker decreased state environmental staffâs capacity in order to accelerate the approval time for a proposed development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Environmental policy : new directions for the twenty-first century |last1=Vig |first1=Norman J. |last2=Kraft |first2=Michael E. |isbn=9781506383460 |edition=10th |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=CQ Press, an imprint of SAGE Publications, Inc. |year=2019 |oclc=1005057455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuing a race to the bottom philosophy in environmental politics allows states to foster economic growth, but has great consequences for the environment of that state. Conversely, some states have begun to pursue a race to the top strategy, which stresses innovative environmental policies at the state level, with the hopes that these policies will later be adopted by other states.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When a state pursues either a race to the bottom or a race to the top strategy, it speaks to its overall environmental agenda.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">In mathematics, a '''rational monoid''' is a [[monoid]], an algebraic structure, for which each element can be represented in a "normal form" which can be computed by a [[finite state transducer|finite transducer]]: multiplication in such a monoid is "easy", in the sense that it can be described by a [[rational function (monoid)|rational function]].

==Definition==
Consider a monoid ''M''.  Consider a pair (''A'',''L'') where ''A'' is a finite subset of ''M'' that generates ''M'' as a monoid, and ''L'' is a language on ''A'' (that is, a subset of the set of all strings ''A''&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;).  Let Ï be the map from the [[free monoid]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; to ''M'' given by evaluating a string as a product in ''M''.  We say that ''L'' is a ''rational cross-section'' if Ï induces a bijection between ''L'' and ''M''.  We say that (''A'',''L'') is a ''rational structure'' for ''M'' if in addition the [[Kernel (algebra)#Monoid homomorphisms|kernel]] of Ï, viewed as a subset of the product monoid ''A''&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt;Ã''A''&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[rational set]].

A '''quasi-rational monoid''' is one for which ''L'' is a [[rational relation]]: a '''rational monoid''' is one for which there is also a [[rational function (monoid)|rational function]] cross-section of ''L''.  Since ''L'' is a subset of a free monoid, [[Kleene's theorem]] holds and a rational function is just one that can be instantiated by a finite state transducer.

==Examples==
* A finite monoid is rational.
* A group is a rational monoid if and only if it is finite.
* A finitely generated free monoid is rational.
* The monoid M4 generated by the set {0,''e'', ''a'',''b'', ''x'',''y''} subject to relations in which ''e'' is the identity, 0 is an [[absorbing element]], each of ''a'' and ''b'' commutes with each of ''x'' and ''y'' and ''ax'' = ''bx'', ''ay'' = ''by'' = ''bby'', ''xx'' = ''xy'' = ''yx'' = ''yy'' = 0 is rational but not automatic.
* The '''Fibonacci monoid''', the quotient of the free monoid on two generators {''a'',''b''}&lt;sup&gt;â&lt;/sup&gt; by the congruence ''aab'' = ''bba''.

==Green's relations==
The [[Green's relations]] for a rational monoid satisfy ''D'' = ''J''.&lt;ref name=Sak87&gt;Sakarovitch (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Kleene's theorem holds for rational monoids: that is, a subset is a recognisable set if and only if it is a rational set.

A rational monoid is not necessarily [[Automatic semigroup|automatic]], and vice versa.  However, a rational monoid is asynchronously automatic and [[Hyperbolic monoid|hyperbolic]].

A rational monoid is a [[regulator monoid]] and a [[quasi-rational monoid]]: each of these implies that it is a [[Kleene monoid]], that is, a monoid in which Kleene's theorem holds.

It is one of the four [[self-evaluation motives]] along with ''[[self-assessment]]'' (the drive for an accurate self-concept), ''[[self-verification]]'' (the drive for a self-concept congruent with one's identity) and ''[[self-improvement]]'' (the act of bettering one's self-concept).
Self-evaluation motives drive the process of self-regulation, that is, how people control and direct their own actions.

There are a variety of strategies that people can use to enhance their sense of personal worth. For example, they can downplay skills that they lack or they can criticise others to seem better by comparison. These strategies are successful, in that people tend to think of themselves as having more positive qualities and fewer negative qualities than others.&lt;ref name=kunda485&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda|1999|pp=485â486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although self-enhancement is seen in people with low self-esteem as well as with high self-esteem, these two groups tend to use different strategies. People who already have high esteem enhance their self-concept directly, by processing new information in a biased way. People with low self-esteem use more indirect strategies, for example by avoiding situations in which their negative qualities will be noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Kunda|1999|pp=465â466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are controversies over whether or not self-enhancement is beneficial to the individual, and over whether self-enhancement is culturally universal or specific to Western individualism.

==Levels==
Self-enhancement can occur in many different situations and under many different guises. The general motive of self-enhancement can have many differing underlying explanations, each of which becomes more or less dominant depending on the situation.

The explanations of the self-enhancement motive can occur in different combinations. Self-enhancement can occur as an underlying motive or personality trait without occurring as an observed effect.

|header1 =
|label1  =   Observed Effect
|data1   = Self-enhancement at the level of an observed effect describes the product of the motive. For example, self-enhancement can produce inflated self-ratings (positive illusions). Such ratings would be self-enhancement manifested as an observed effect. It is an observable instance of the motive.
|header2 =
|label2  =   Ongoing Process
|data2   = Self-enhancement at the level of an ongoing process describes the actual operation of the motive. For example, self-enhancement can result in attributing favourable outcomes to the self and unfavourable outcomes to others (self-serving attribution bias). The actual act of attributing such ratings would be self-enhancement manifested as an ongoing process. It is the motive in operation.
|header3 =
|label3  =   Personality Trait
|data3   = Self-enhancement at the level of a personality trait describes habitual or inadvertent self-enhancement. For example, self-enhancement can cause situations to be created to ease the pain of failure (self-handicapping). The fabrication of such situations or excuses frequently and without awareness would be self-enhancement manifested as a personality trait. It is the repetitive inclination to demonstrate the motive.
|header4 =
|label4  =   Underlying Motive
|data4   = Self-enhancement at the level of an underlying motive describes the conscious desire to self-enhance. For example, self-enhancement can cause the comparison of the self to a worse other, making the self seem greater in comparison (strategic social comparisons). The act of comparing intentionally to achieve superiority would be self-enhancement manifested as an underlying motive. It is the genuine desire to see the self as superior.

==Dimensions==
Both the extent and the type of self-enhancement vary across a number of dimensions.&lt;ref name=SedikidesGregg2008 /&gt;

===Self-advancement vs. self-protection===
Self-enhancement can occur by either self-advancing or self-protecting, that is either by enhancing the positivity of one's self-concept, or by reducing the negativity of one's self-concept.&lt;ref name=Arkin1981&gt;{{Citation |last=Arkin |first=R. M.  | year = 1981 | title= Self-presentation styles. In J. Tedeschi (Ed.),'' Impression management theory and research'' (pp. 311-333). New York: Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-protection appears to be the stronger of the two motives, given that avoiding negativity is of greater importance than encouraging positivity.&lt;ref name=BaumeisterBratslavskyFinenauerVohs2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Baumeister |first=R. F.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 2001 | title= Bad is stronger than good| journal =  Review of General Psychology | volume = 5 | pages= 323â370 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.5.4.323 |last2=Bratslavsky |first2=Ellen |last3=Finkenauer |first3=Catrin |last4=Vohs |first4=Kathleen D. |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with all motivations, there are differences between individuals. For example, people with higher self-esteem appear to favour self-advancement, whereas people with lower self-esteem tend to self-protect.&lt;ref name=Tice1991&gt;{{Citation|last1=Tice|first1=Dianne M.|title=Esteem protection or enhancement?

People high in self-esteem tend to be greater risk takers and therefore opt for the more risky strategy of self-advancement, whereas those low in self-esteem and risk-taking hedge their bets with self-protection.&lt;ref name=JosephsLarrickSteeleNIsbett1992&gt;{{Citation |last=Josephs |first=R.

===Candid vs. tactical===
Self-enhancement can occur either candidly or tactically.&lt;ref name=SedikidesStrube1997&gt;{{Citation|last1=Sedikides|first1=C|last2=Strube|first2=M|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology Volume 29|volume=29|year=1997|pages=209â269|issn=0065-2601|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60018-0|chapter=Self-Evaluation: To Thine Own Self Be Good, To Thine Own Self Be Sure, To Thine Own Self Be True, and To Thine Own Self be Better|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152292|postscript=.}} In M.

==Types==
Self-enhancement does not just occur at random. Its incidence is often highly systematic and can occur in any number of ways in order to achieve its goal of inflating perceptions of the self. Importantly, we are typically unaware that we are self-enhancing. Awareness of self-enhancing processes would highlight the facade we are trying to create, revealing that the self we perceive is in fact an enhanced version of our actual self.

===Self-serving attribution bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
Self-enhancement can also affect the causal explanations people generate for social outcomes. People have a tendency to exhibit a self-serving attribution bias, that is to attribute positive outcomes to one's internal disposition but negative outcomes to factors beyond one's control e.g. others, chance or circumstance.&lt;ref name=MezulisAbramsonHydeHankin2004&gt;{{Citation|last1=Mezulis|first1=Amy H.|last2=Abramson|first2=Lyn Y.|last3=Hyde|first3=Janet S.|last4=Hankin|first4=Benjamin L.|title=Is There a Universal Positivity Bias in Attributions?

People sometimes self-enhance by selectively remembering their strengths rather than weaknesses. This pattern of selective forgetting has been described as [[mnemic neglect]]. Mnemic neglect may reflect biases in the processing of information at either encoding, retrieval or retention.
*Biases at encoding occur via selective attention and selective exposure.
*Biases at retrieval and retention occur via selective recall.
The role of mnemic neglect can be emphasised or reduced by the characteristics of a certain behaviour or trait. For example, after receiving false feedback pertaining to a variety of behaviours, participants recalled more positive behaviours than negative ones, but only when the behaviours exemplified central not peripheral traits and only when feedback pertained to the self and not to others.&lt;ref name=SedikidesGreen2000&gt;{{Citation |last=Sedikides |first=C. |lastauthoramp=y | year = 2000 | title= On the self-protective nature of inconsistency/negativity management: Using the person memory paradigm to examine self-referent memory| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | pages= 906â922 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.906 |pmid=11138760 |last2=Green |first2=JD |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings emerge when the to-be-recalled information is personality traits,&lt;ref name=MischelEbbesenZeiss1976&gt;{{Citation |last=Mischel |first=W.|lastauthoramp=y  | year = 1976 | title= Determinants of selective memory about the self| journal =  Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 44 | pages= 92â103 |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.44.1.92 |pmid=1245637 |last2=Ebbesen |first2=EB |last3=Zeis |first3=AM |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; relationship promoting or undermining behaviours,&lt;ref name=vanLangeRusbultSemin-GoossensGoertsStalpers1999&gt;{{Citation |last=van Lange |first=P.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1999 | title= Being better than others but otherwise perfectly normal: Perceptions of uniqueness and similarity in close relationships| journal =  Personal Relationships | volume = 6 | pages= 269â289 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1999.tb00192.x |last2=Rusbult |first2=Caryl E. |last3=Semin-Goossens |first3=Astrid |last4=Gorts |first4=Carien A. |last5=Stalpers |first5=Mirjam |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequencies of social acts,&lt;ref name=GoslingJohnCraikRobins1998&gt;{{Citation|last1=Gosling|first1=Samuel D.|last2=John|first2=Oliver P.|last3=Craik|first3=Kenneth H.|last4=Robins|first4=Richard W.|title=Do people know how they behave?

====Selective acceptance and refutation====
Selective acceptance involves taking as fact self-flattering or ego-enhancing information with little regard for its validity. Selective refutation involves searching for plausible theories that enable criticism to be discredited. A good example of selective acceptance and refutation in action would be: Selective acceptance is the act of accepting as valid an examination on which one has performed well without consideration of alternatives, whereas selective refutation would be mindfully searching for reasons to reject as invalid an examination on which one has performed poorly.&lt;ref name=ArkinMaruyama1979&gt;{{Citation |last=Arkin |first=R.

Concordant with selective acceptance and refutation is the observation that people hold a more critical attitude towards blame placed upon them, but a more lenient attitude to praise that they receive.&lt;ref name=DittoBoardman1995 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PyszczynskiGreenberg1987&gt;{{Citation |last=Pyszczynski |first=T.|lastauthoramp=y  | year = 1987 | title= toward an integration of cognitive and motivational perspectives on social inference: A biased hypothesis-testing model| journal =  Advances in Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 20 | pages= 297â341 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60417-7 |series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |last2=Greenberg |first2=Jeff |isbn=9780120152209}}&lt;/ref&gt; People will strongly contest uncongenial information but readily accept at without question congenial information&lt;ref name=DittoLopez1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DittoScepanskyMunroApanovitchLockhart1998&gt;{{Citation |last=Ditto |first=P.

===Strategies===

====Strategic social comparisons====
[[File:Social Comparison Diagram.JPG|thumb|200px|The potential directions for strategic social comparisons.]]
The social nature of the world we live in means that self-evaluation cannot take place in an absolute nature â comparison to other social beings is inevitable. Many social comparisons occur automatically as a consequence of circumstance, for example within an exam sitting social comparisons of intellect may occur to those sitting the same exam. However, the strength of the self-enhancement motive can cause the subjective exploitation of scenarios in order to give a more favourable outcome to the self in comparisons between the self and others. Such involuntary social comparisons prompt self-regulatory strategies.

Self-esteem moderates the beneficial, evaluative consequences of comparisons to both inferior and superior others. People with higher self-esteem are more optimistic about both evading the failures and misfortunes of their inferiors and about securing the successes and good fortunes of their superiors.&lt;ref name=BuunkCollinsTaylorVanYperenDakof1990&gt;{{Citation |last=Buunk |first=B. P.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1990 | title= The affective consequences of social comparisons: Either directions has its ups and downs| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | pages= 1238â1249 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.6.1238 |pmid=2283590 |last2=Collins |first2=RL |last3=Taylor |first3=SE |last4=Vanyperen |first4=NW |last5=Dakof |first5=GA |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Upward social comparisons=====
An upwards social comparison involves comparing oneself to an individual perceived to be superior to or better than oneself. Upwards social comparison towards someone felt to be similar to oneself can induce self-enhancement through assimilation of the self and other's characteristics,&lt;ref name=Collins1996&gt;{{Citation |last=Collins |first=R. L.  | year = 1996 | title= For better for worse: The impact of upwards social comparison on self-evaluation| journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 119 | pages=51â69 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this only occurs when:
*The gap between the self and the comparison target is not too large;&lt;ref name=Wheeler1966&gt;{{Citation |last=Wheeler |first=L.  | year = 1966 | title= Motivation as a determinant of upwards social comparison| journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 2 | pages=27â31 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(66)90062-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The skill or success being compared is attainable;&lt;ref name=LockwoodKunda1997&gt;{{Citation |last=Lockwood |first=P.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1997 | title= Superstars and me: Predicting the impact of role models on self| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 73 | pages=91â103 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.1.91 |last2=Kunda |first2=Ziva}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The comparison target is perceived as a competitor.&lt;ref name=Wood1989&gt;{{Citation |last=Wood |first=J. V.  | year = 1989 | title= Theory and research concerning social comparison of personality attributes| journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 106 | pages=231â248 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.106.2.231 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Where assimilation does not occur as a result of a social comparison, contrast can instead occur which can lead to upwards social comparisons providing inspiration.&lt;ref name=Collins2000&gt;{{Citation |last=Collins |first=R. L. |lastauthoramp=y | year = 2000 | contribution= Among the better ones: Upward assimilation in social comparison|editor1=J. Suls|editor2=L. Wheeler|title=Handbook of social comparison'' |pages=159â172|location=New York|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Downward social comparisons=====
Even though upwards social comparisons are the most common social comparisons,&lt;ref name=Gruder1971&gt;{{Citation |last=Gruder |first=C. L.  | year = 1971 | title= Determinants of social comparison choices| journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 1 | pages=473â489 |doi=10.1016/0022-1031(71)90010-2 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MillerTrunbullMcFarland1988&gt;{{Citation |last=Miller |first=D.

Downwards social comparisons involve comparing oneself to an individual perceived to be inferior to or less skilled than the self. Downwards social comparisons serve as a form of ego-defence whereby the ego is inflated due to the sense of superiority gained from such downwards social comparisons.&lt;ref name=BiernatBillings2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Biernat |first=M.|author2=Billings, L.

A.|year=1991|title=Social comparison: Contemporary theory and research|location=Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Lateral social comparisons=====
Lateral social comparisons, comparisons against those perceived as equal to the self, can also be self-enhancing. Comparisons with members of one's in-group can lead be protective against low self-esteem, especially when the in-group are disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=CrockerVoelklTestaMajor1991&gt;{{Citation |last=Crocker |first=J., Voelkl, K.|author2=Testa, M.|author3=Major, B.|lastauthoramp=y   | year = 1991 | title= Social stigma and self-esteem: The self-protective properties of stigma| journal = Psychological Review | volume = 96 | pages=803â808 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.96.4.608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Self-evaluation maintenance theory=====
{{Main|Self-evaluation maintenance theory}}
Self-enhancement waxes and wanes as a function of one's ability level in the context of interpersonal relationships, and this, in turn influences interpersonal attitudes and behaviours. Three factors influence the self-evaluations people make:&lt;ref name=Tesser1988&gt;{{Citation |last=Tesser |first=A.  | year = 1988 | title= Towards a self-evaluation maintenance model of social behaviour. In L. Berkowitz (Ed.),'' Advances in experimental social psychology'' (vol. 21, pp. 181-227). New York: Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Closeness of a relationship:'' comparison of one's own performance with that of another is more likely to occur, and when it does is more consequential when others are close rather than distant.
*''Personal relevance of a particular ability:'' when the domain is not relevant to oneself reflection will occur and when the domain is relevant comparison will occur.
**''Reflection:'' one will undergo self-enhancement (pride) when the other does well, but self-derogation (shame) when the other does poorly.
**''Comparison:'' one will undergo self-derogation (humiliation) if others perform well, but self-enhancement (triumph) if the other performs poorly.
*Level of performance in that ability domain.

People adopt a variety of coping strategies to deal with the pressures of self-evaluation:
*Choose friends and partners who excel, but not in the same domains as they do;&lt;ref name=BeachTesser1993&gt;{{Citation |last=Beach |first=S. R.

*Strategic construals can also be more subtle. People make self-aggrandizing interpretations not only of their own attributes, but also of others in order to appear greater by comparison.

Self-esteem level appears to moderate the use of strategic construals. As well as operating as a function of self-esteem level, strategic construals also appear to protect self-esteem levels. For example, members of minority groups who perform poorly in academic settings due to negative cultural attitudes towards them, subsequently disengage psychologically from, and dissidentify with academic pursuits in general. Whilst buffering their self-esteem level they jeopardise their future socioeconomic prospects.&lt;ref name=CrockerMajorSteele1998&gt;{{Citation |last=Crocker |first=J.|author2=Major, B.|author3=Steele, C. |lastauthoramp=y | year = 1998 | contribution= Social stigma|editor1=D.

Regardless of the causes of self-handicapping the self-defeating end result remains the same â the integrity and quality of a task outcome or evaluation is compromised in order that the meaning of that outcome appears more agreeable. Behavioural self-handicapping is a good demonstration of active self-deception.&lt;ref name=Giannetti2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Giannetti |first=E.  | year = 2001 | title='' Lies we live by: The art of self-deception.''

Whilst task performance is important to people, they do sometimes act in ways so as to paradoxically impair task performance,&lt;ref name=JonesBerglas1978 /&gt; either to protect against the shame of performing poorly by creating a convenient excuse (discounting), or to enhance themselves by succeeding despite adversity by creating grounds for conceit (augmenting).&lt;ref name=RhodewaltMorfHazlettFairfield1991 /&gt; Furthermore, self-handicapping can have unintentional adverse consequences.

====Above-average effect====
{{Main|Illusory superiority}}
The [[Illusory superiority|better-than-average-effect]] is the most common demonstration of an above-average effect. It is a highly robust effect, as evidenced by the fact that even when the criteria on which the self and others are judged are identical the self is still perceived more favourably.&lt;ref name=AlickeVredenburgHiattGovorun2001 /&gt; Things close to the self also take on the perceived superiority of the above-average effect.

However, where an outcome is perceived as highly skilled, people often err on the side of caution and display a [[worse-than-average effect]]. The majority of people would rate themselves as below average in unicycling ability, for example.
[[File:Self-Enhancing Triad.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The three related divisions of the self-enhancing triad.]]

The illusory nature of the above-average effect comes from the fact that not everyone can be above-average â otherwise the average would not be the average! The majority of people rating themselves as being better than the majority of people does not quite seem plausible, and in some situations is 100% impossible. Where a distribution is symmetrical i.e. mean = median = mode, it is statistically impossible for the majority of people to be above average, as whichever of the three averages is taken, all are equal to the 50th percentile.&lt;ref name=Brown1998&gt;{{Citation |last=Brown |first=J.  | year = 1998 | title='' The self.'' New York: McGraw-Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a non-symmetrical distribution i.e. mean &lt; median &lt; mode or mode &lt; median &lt; mean, it is statistically impossible for the majority of people to be above average when the average is taken to be the median, as the median represents the 50th percentile, or the midpoint of the data.&lt;ref name=Brown1998 /&gt; However, in a non-symmetrical distribution where the average is taken to be either the mean or the mode, the above-average effect can be statistically plausible. In some situations the majority of people can be above-average!

People show self-enhancement in the form of the above-average effect in many different ways. It is typical for people to profess to be above-average at a task yielding positive or desirable outcomes, and below average at a task yielding negative or undesirable outcomes.

Some of the wide variety of documented examples of the above-average effect include observations that:

==Constraints==

===Plausibility===
Self-enhancement thrives upon the vagueness or ambiguity of evidence. Where criteria are rigidly defined, self-enhancement typically reduces. For example, the above-average effect decreases as clarity and definition of the defined trait increases.&lt;ref name=vanLangeSedikides1998&gt;{{Citation |last=van Lange |first=P. A. M.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1998 | title= Being more honest but not necessarily more intelligent than others: Generality and explanations for the Muhammad Ali effect| journal =  European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 28 | pages= 675â680 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199807/08)28:4&lt;675::AID-EJSP883&gt;3.0.CO;2-5 |last2=Sedikides |first2=Constantine |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The easier it is to verify a behaviour or trait, the less that trait will be subject to self-enhancement. The plausibility of a trait or characteristic given real world evidence moderates the degree to which the self-enhancement of that trait occurs. Selectively recalling instances of desirable traits is moderated by one's actual standing on those traits in reality.&lt;ref name=SanitiosoKundaFong1990&gt;{{Citation |last=Sanitioso |first=R.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 1990 | title= Motivated recruitment of autobiographical memories| journal =  Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | pages= 229â241 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.229 |pmid=2213492 |last2=Kunda |first2=Z |last3=Fong |first3=GT |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When plausibility reduces the impact of self-enhancement, undesirable evidence often has to be accepted, albeit reluctantly. This typically occurs when all possible interpretations of the evidence in question have been made.&lt;ref name=DoosjeSpearsKoomen1995/&gt; The reason for this unwilling acceptance is to maintain effective social functioning, where unqualified self-aggrandizement would otherwise prevent it.&lt;ref name=MorfRhodewalt2001&gt;{{Citation |last=Morf, C.

The constraint of plausibility on self enhancement exists because self-enhancing biases cannot be exploited. Self-enhancement works only under the assumption of rationality â to admit to self-enhancing totally undermines any conclusions one can draw and any possibility of believing its facade, since according to legit rational processes it functions as a genuinely verifiable and accredited improvement.&lt;ref name=GilbertPinelWilsonBlumbergWheatley1998&gt;{{Citation |last=Gilbert |first=D.

===Mood===
Both positive and negative moods can reduce the presence of the self-enhancement motive. The effects of mood on self-enhancement can be explained by a negative mood making the use self-enhancing tactics harder, and a positive mood making their use less necessary in the first place.

The onset of a positive mood can make people more receptive to negative diagnostic feedback. Past successes are reviewed with expectation of receiving such positive feedback, presumably to buffer their mood.&lt;ref name=TropeNeter1994&gt;{{Citation |last=Trope |first=Y. |lastauthoramp=y  | year = 1994 | title= Reconciling competing motives in self-evaluation: The role of self-control in feedback seeking| journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | pages=646â657 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.4.646 |pmid=8189345 |last2=Neter |first2=E |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social context and relationships===
The presence of the motive to self-enhance is dependent on many social situations, and the relationships shared with the people in them. Many different materialisations of self-enhancement can occur depending on such social contexts:
*The self-enhancement motive is weaker during interactions with close and significant others.
*When friends (or previous strangers whose intimacy levels have been enhanced) cooperate on a task, they do not exhibit a self-serving attribution bias.
**Casual acquaintances and true strangers however do exhibit a self-serving attribution bias.&lt;ref name=SedikidesHerbstHardinDardis2002/&gt;
**Where no self-serving bias is exhibited in a relationship, a betrayal of trust in the relationship will reinstate the self-serving bias. This corresponds to findings that relationship satisfaction is inversely correlated with the betrayal of trust.&lt;ref name=FinchamBradbury1989&gt;{{Citation |last=Fincham |first=F.

Self-enhancement appears to be a phenomenon largely limited to Western cultures, where social ties are looser than in the East. This is concordant with empirical evidence highlighting relationship closeness as a constraint on self-enhancement.&lt;ref name=SedikidesCampbellReederElliot2002&gt;{{Citation |last=Sedikides |first=C.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 2002 | title= The self in relationships: Whether, how and when close others put the self "in its place"|editor1= W.

There are nevertheless signs that self-enhancement is not completely absent in interdependent cultures.

One possible explanation for the observed differences in self-enhancement between cultures is that they may occur through differences in how candidly of tactically the motive to self-enhance is acted upon, and not due to variations in the strength of motive.&lt;ref name=SedikidesStrube1997/&gt; Alternatively, self-enhancement may be represented only in terms of the characteristics that are deemed important by individuals as they strive to fulfil their culturally prescribed roles.

The issue over whether self-enhancement is universal or specific to Western cultures has been contested within modern literature by two researchers â [[Constantine Sedikides]] and [[Steven Heine (psychologist)|Steven Heine]]. Sedikides argues that self-enhancement is universal, and that different cultures self-enhance in domains important in their culture. Heine on the other hand describes self-enhancement as a predominantly Western motive.&lt;ref name=SedikidesGaertnerToguchi2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GaertnerSedikidesChang2008&gt;{{Citation |last=Gaertner |first=L.|lastauthoramp=y | year = 2008 | title= On pancultural self-enhancement: Well-adjusted Taiwanese self-enhance on personally valued traits| journal =  Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology | volume = 39 | pages= 463â477 |doi=10.1177/0022022108318431 |last2=Sedikides |first2=C. |last3=Chang |first3=K. |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HeineKitayamaHamamura2007a&gt;{{Citation |last=Heine |first=S.

===Other motives===
It is an exaggeration to say that self-enhancement is the dominant [[self-evaluation motives|self-evaluation motive]]. Many controversies exist regarding the distinction between the self-evaluation motives, and there are situations in which motives asides from self-enhancement assume priority.
#The [[self-assessment]] motive is often contrasted with the self-enhancement motive due to the relative adaptiveness of each approach within social interactions.
#The [[self-verification]] motive is often challenged by supporters of the self-enhancement as being unfeasible as it often appears implausible.
#The [[self-improvement]] motive is often taken to be the physical manifestation of the self-enhancement motive i.e. the act of attaining desired positive self views.
Where the truth about oneself worsens or varies it gradually becomes less feasible to satisfy all motives simultaneously.

In an attempt to compare the self-evaluation motives (excluding self-improvement) a self-reflection task was employed. Participants were asked to choose the question they would most likely ask themselves in order to determine whether they possessed a certain [[Personality type|personality]] trait. On the whole, people self-enhanced more than they self-assessed or self-verified. People chose higher diagnosticity questions concerning central, positive traits than central, negative ones, and answered yes more often to central, positive than negative questions. Also, people self-verified more than the self-assessed, and chose more questions overall concerning relatively certain central traits than relatively uncertain peripheral traits.&lt;ref name=Sedikides1993&gt;{{Citation|last1=Sedikides|first1=Constantine|title=Assessment, enhancement, and verification determinants of the self-evaluation process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=65|issue=2|year=1993|pages=317â338|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.2.317|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goetia_seals.jpg|thumb|right|Goetic seals from [[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]]]

A '''sigil''' ({{IPAc-en|Ë|s|Éª|dÊ|Él}}; pl. ''sigilla'' or ''sigils'') is a symbol used in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. The term has usually referred to a type of pictorial signature of a [[demon]] or other entity; in modern usage, especially in the context of [[chaos magic]], it refers to a symbolic representation of the magician's desired outcome.

==History==

The term ''sigil'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''sigillum'', meaning "[[Seal (emblem)|seal]]".&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;[[#refWeschcke|Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn &amp; Slate, Joe H. ''The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval [[ceremonial magic]], the term ''sigil'' was commonly used to refer to occult signs which represented various [[angels]] and [[demons]] which the magician might summon.&lt;ref name=Weschcke&gt;[[#refWeschcke|Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn &amp; Slate, Joe H. ''The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment'']]&lt;/ref&gt; The magical training books called [[grimoire]]s often listed pages of such sigils. A particularly well-known list is in ''[[The Lesser Key of Solomon]]'', in which the sigils of the 72 princes of the hierarchy of hell are given for the magician's use. Such sigils were considered to be the equivalent of the [[true name]] of the spirit and thus granted the magician a measure of control over the beings.&lt;ref name="Peterson-intro"&gt;''Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis: The Lesser Key of Solomon, Detailing the Ceremonial Art of Commanding Spirits Both Good and Evil''; ed. Joseph H. Peterson; Weiser Books, Maine; 2001. p.''xi''-''xvii''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sefer raziel segulot.png|thumb|250px|right|An excerpt from ''[[Sefer Raziel HaMalakh]]'' featuring various magical sigils (or ×¡×××××ª, ''segulot'', in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]).]]

A common method of creating the sigils of certain spirits was to use ''[[Magic square#Europe|kameas]]'' ([[magic square]]s) â the names of the spirits were converted to numbers, which were then located on the magic square. The locations were then connected by lines, forming an abstract figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Encyclopedia of The Occult |author=Greer, John Michael |publisher=[[Llewellyn Worldwide]] |year=2003 |isbn=1-56718-336-0 |page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The word sigil... has a long history in [[Magic_(paranormal)|Western magic]]. The members of [[Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn|the Golden Dawn]] were perfectly familiar with it("combining the letters, the colours, the attributions and their Synthesis, thou mayest build up a [[talisman|telesmatic Image]] of a Force. The Sigil shall then serve thee for the tracing of a Current which shall call into action a certain Elemental Force") and it was used in the making of talismans. The sigil was like a signature or sign of an occult entity.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The use of symbols for magical or cultic purposes has been widespread since at least the [[Neolithic]] era. Some examples from other cultures include the ''[[yantra]]'' from  [[Hindu]] [[tantra]], historical [[runic magic]] among the [[Germanic peoples]], or the use of ''[[veve]]s'' in [[Voudon]].

==Austin Osman Spare==

The artist and occultist [[Austin Osman Spare]] developed his own unique method of creating and using sigils, which has had a huge effect on modern occultism. Essentially, Spare turned the Medieval practice of using sigils to evoke entities on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply [[Complex_(psychology)|complexes]] in the unconscious, and could be actively ''created'' through the process of sigilisation. &lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The big difference with Spare's method was that he dispensed with pre-existing esoterica and external beliefs, so the sigils were no longer for controlling traditional demons, angels and what-have-you, but instead for controlling forces in the unconscious psyche of the individual operator.&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;[[#refBaker|Baker, Phil. ''Austin Osman Spare'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Spare's technique became a cornerstone of [[chaos magic]].&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt; It also influenced the artist [[Brion Gysin]], who experimented with combinining Spare's sigil method with the traditional form of magic squares:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Calligraphic magick squares were one of the techniques most commonly applied by Gysin. He would reduce a name or an idea to a "glyph" and then write across the paper from right to left, turn the paper and do the same again, and so on, turning the paper around and around to create a multi-dimensional grid... The same techniques and consciously driven functional intention also permeated his paintings. In a very real sense, everything he created was an act of sorcery.&lt;ref name=P-Orridge2&gt;[[#refP-Orridge2|P-Orridge, Genesis. ''Magick Squares and Future Beats'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chaos magic==
{{main|Chaos magic#sigils}}
[[File:Sigil shoal.svg|thumb|A shoal of sigils]]


In [[chaos magic]], following Spare, sigils are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of [[monogram]]. The chaos magician then uses the [[gnosis_(chaos_magic)|gnostic state]] to "launch" or "charge" the sigil â essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;[[#refSherwin1|Sherwin, Ray. ''The Book of Results'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt; To quote [[Ray Sherwin]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by desire.&lt;ref name=Sherwin1&gt;[[#refSherwin1|Sherwin, Ray. ''The Book of Results'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: in the words of Spare, there should be "a deliberate striving to forget it".&lt;ref name=Spare1&gt;[[#refSpare1|Spare, Austin Osman. ''The Book of Pleasure'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a [[Servitor (chaos magic)|servitor]].&lt;ref name=Hine2&gt;[[#refHine2|Hine, Phil. ''Prime Chaos'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marik2&gt;[[#refMarik2|Marik. ''Servitors'']]&lt;/ref&gt; When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of "group mind", then it is referred to as an [[egregore]].&lt;ref name=Rysen&gt;[[#refRysen|Rysen, Fenwick ''The Fluid Continuum'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Emerson&gt;[[#refEmerson|Emerson, Gabriel. ''Egregore Definition Compilation'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilisation technique. [[Grant Morrison]] coined the term ''hypersigil'' to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His [[comic book]] series ''[[The Invisibles]]'' was intended as such a hypersigil.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison has also argued that modern [[Logo|corporate logos]] like "the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph" are a form of viral sigil:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Corporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.&lt;ref name=Morrison&gt;[[#refMorrison|Morrison, Grant. ''Pop Magic!'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gordon White developed the technique of ''shoaling'', which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilising for "money", sigilising for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc. â all of which help "shift the probability" towards the overall aim.&lt;ref name=White4&gt;[[#refWhite4|White, Gordon ''Sigils Reboot'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=White2&gt;[[#refWhite2|White, Gordon. ''Shoaling'']]&lt;/ref&gt; White also developed the technique of the ''robofish'', which consists of including a sigil for something that the chaos magician knows will definitely happen, to "lead" the rest of the shoal.&lt;ref name=White3&gt;[[#refWhite3|White, Gordon. ''Magic Secrets as Taught by Robot Fish'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faras Saint Anne (detail).jpg|thumb|[[Copts|Coptic]], 8th century, [[National Museum in Warsaw]]]]
'''Silence''' is the absence of ambient [[hearing (sense)|audible]] [[sound]], the emission of sounds of such low [[sound intensity|intensity]] that they do not draw attention to themselves, or the state of having ceased to produce sounds; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of [[communication]], whether through [[speech]] or other medium.&lt;ref name=Dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/silence |title=Silence &amp;#124; Define Silence at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Sometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves. [[Discourse analysis]] shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of [[prosodic unit]]s, in [[turn-taking]], or as
reactive tokens, e.g., as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like.  Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in [[ritual]]s; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation. 

==Social Uses of Silence==
===In danger===
[[Joseph Jordania]] has suggested that in [[social animals]] (including [[humans]]), silence can be a sign of danger. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard sounds which are known as [[contact calls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macedonia |first1=Joseph M. |title=Individuality in a contact call of the ringtailed lemur (Lemur catta) |journal=American Journal of Primatology |date=1986 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=163â179 |doi=10.1002/ajp.1350110208}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are a mixture of various sounds, accompanying the group's everyday business (for example, [[foraging]], [[feeding]]), and they are used to maintain [[Sound|audio]] contact with the members of the group. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls and freezing, without the use of [[alarm calls]], through silence. [[Charles Darwin]] wrote about this in relation with wild horse and cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]] | author = Charles Darwin |year = 2004 | publisher = Penguin Books. pg. 123 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordania has further suggested that human [[humming]] could have been a contact method that early humans used to avoid silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordania|first1= Joseph|date= 2009|title= Times to Fight and Times to Relax: Singing and Humming at the Beginnings of Human Evolutionary History|journal= Kadmos|volume= 1|pages= 272â277|url=http://www.josephjordania.com/files/57-Times-to-fight-and-times-to-relax-Kadmos.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his suggestion, humans find prolonged silence distressing (suggesting danger to them). This may help explain why lone humans in relative sonic isolation feel a sense of comfort from humming, whistling, talking to themselves, or having the TV or radio on.

===In spirituality===
{{See also|Vow of silence|Monastic silence}}
"Silence" in spirituality is often a metaphor for inner stillness. A silent mind, freed from the onslaught of thoughts and thought patterns, is both a goal and an important step in spiritual development. Such "inner silence" is not about the absence of sound; instead, it is understood to bring one in contact with the divine, the ultimate reality, or one's own true self, one's divine nature.&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/tp4 ''Ontology and the Wonder of Silence'', Part Four of The Tree of Philosophy] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 2000). See also "[http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/srp/arts/SFPQ.htm Silence as the Ultimate Fulfillment of the Philosophical Quest]", ''Journal Hekmat Va Falsafeh'', (''Journal of Wisdom and Philosophy''), Issue 6 (August 2006), pp.67â76.&lt;/ref&gt; Many religious traditions imply the importance of being quiet and still in mind and spirit for transformative and integral spiritual growth to occur. In Christianity, there is the silence of [[contemplative prayer]] such as [[centering prayer]] and [[Christian meditation]]; in Islam, there are the wisdom writings of the [[Sufis]] who insist on the importance of finding silence within. In [[Buddhism]], the descriptions of silence and allowing the mind to become silent are implied as a feature of spiritual [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. In Hinduism, including the teachings of [[Advaita Vedanta]] and the many paths of yoga, teachers insist on the importance of silence, ''[[Mauna (silence)|Mauna]]'', for inner growth. Perkey Avot, the Jewish Sages guide for living, states that, "Tradition is a safety fence to Torah, tithing a safety fence to wealth, vows a safety fence for abstinence; a safety fence for wisdom&amp;nbsp;... is silence." In some traditions of [[Quakerism]], communal silence is the usual context of worship meetings, in patient expectancy for the divine to speak in the heart and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Britain Yearly Meeting, "Quaker Faith and Practice"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quakerweb.org.uk/qfp/ Third Edition, 2005 (?), sections 2.01, 2.12â17 etc., The Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in Britain, London], {{ISBN|0-85245-375-2}} / {{ISBN|0-85245-374-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eckhart Tolle]] says that silence can be seen either as the absence of noise, or as the space in which sound exists, just as inner stillness can be seen as the absence of thought, or the space in which thoughts are perceived.

===Commemorative silence===
{{Main|Moment of silence}}
[[File:US_Army_51759_Soldiers_bow_their_heads_during_a_moment_of_silence_before_going_on_a_commemorative_march_on_Forward_Operating_Base_Warrior,_Kirkuk,_Iraq,_Sept._11._The_march_gave_Soldiers_the_opportunity_to_reflect.jpg|thumb|Soldiers bow their heads during a moment of silence before going on a commemorative march on ''[[Forward operating base|Forward Operating Base Warrior]]'', [[Kirkuk]], [[Iraq]], Sept. 11. The march gave Soldiers the opportunity to reflect on the tragedy that happened eight years prior.]]
A common way to remember a tragic incident and to remember the victims or casualties of such an event is a commemorative [[moment of silence]].

===In debate===
Argumentative silence is the [[rhetoric]]al practice of saying nothing when an opponent in a [[debate]] expects something to be said. Poorly executed, it can be offensive, like refusing to answer a direct question. However, well-timed silence can throw an opponent off and give the debater the upper hand.

An [[argument from silence]] ({{lang-la|argumentum ex silentio}}) is an argument based on the assumption that someone's silence on a matter suggests (an [[informal fallacy]]) that person's ignorance of the matter. In general, ''ex silentio'' refers to the claim that the absence of something demonstrates the proof of a proposition.

===In law===
The [[right to silence]] is a legal protection enjoyed by people undergoing police interrogation or trial in certain countries. The law is either explicit or recognized in many legal systems.

==In art, entertainment, and media==
===Film===
The documentary film ''[[In Pursuit of Silence]]'' (2016) portrays the spiritual and physical benefits of silence, as well as the price paid individually and collectively for a noisy world.&lt;ref name=HuffPost20160308/&gt; It is narrated by authors Helen Lees (''Silence in Schools''), [[Pico Iyer]] (''The Art of Stillness''), [[Susan Cain]] (''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|Quiet]]''), [[Martha Reeves (anchorite)|Maggie Ross]] (''Silence: A Userâs Guide''), and George Prochnik (''In Pursuit of Silence'').&lt;ref name=HuffPost20160308&gt;{{cite news |last1=McColman |first1=Carl |title=In Pursuit of Silence: A Quiet Movie With Much to Say |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-mccolman/in-pursuit-of-silence-a-q_1_b_9396596.html |work=The Huffington Post|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312171246/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-mccolman/in-pursuit-of-silence-a-q_1_b_9396596.html |archivedate=March 12, 2016 |date=March 8, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Rest (music)}}
Music inherently depends on silence, in some form or another, to distinguish other periods of sound and allow [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Melody|melodies]], and [[Rhythm|rhythms]] to have greater impact. For example, most music scores feature ''[[rest (music)|rest]]s'', which denote periods of silence. In addition, silence in music can be seen as a time for contemplation. The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and melodies, and can intentionally reflect on what they have heard. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within a given [[musical composition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cox |first1=Christoph |last2=Warner |first2=Daniel  |year=2004 |title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music}}:&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Sound and Silence'' (1970), the composer [[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]] says, "the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers." He gives as an example "the general pause in the middle of the chorus âHave lightnings and thunders â¦â in [[Johan Sebastian Bach|Bach]]âs ''[[St Matthew Passion|St. Matthew Passion]]''":&lt;ref name="Paynter, J. 1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paynter, J.|author2=Aston, P.|last-author-amp=yes |date=1970|title=Sound and Silence|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bach from St Matthew Passion.png|thumb|center|500px|"Sind Blitze, sind Donner" (chorus) from the ''St. Matthew Passion''.]]
After the pause, the music continues to the words: "Open up the fiery bottomless pit, O hell!" The silence is intended to communicate a momentary sensation of terror, of staring into unfathomable darkness. Another example of a dramatic silence comes in the "rest full of tension" at the climactic ending of the [[Messiah Part II|''Hallelujah'' chorus]] in [[Handel]]âs [[Messiah (Handel)|''Messiah'']]:
{{Listen|type=music|filename=Handel - messiah - 44 hallelujah.ogg|title=''Hallelujah'' (3:47)|description=Performed by MIT Concert Choir, directed by William C. Cutter}}
[[File:Hallelujah Chorus (conclusion).png|thumb|center|500px|The closing bars of the famous ''Hallelujah'' chorus from Handel's 1741 [[oratorio]] ''Messiah'']]

Musical silences may also convey humour. [[Haydn]]'s Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 was nicknamed "The Joke", because of the [[comic timing]] of the pauses at the end of the last movement:
[[File:Haydn op 33 No 2 ending.png|thumb|center|500px|The closing bars of String Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 by Haydn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmoA5fy_kvQ&amp;t=2m45s|title=Endellion String Quartet play Haydn's "The Joke" Presto|first=|last=sanmiguelmusica|date=6 August 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Taruskin (2010, p.&amp;nbsp;552) says, "whenever this ending is performed, it takes the audience an extra second or so to recover its wits and realize that the piece is indeed over. The result is an inevitable giggleâthe same giggle that overtakes a [[prestidigitator]]âs audience when it realizes that it has been âhadâ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.oxfordwesternmusic.com/|last=Taruskin|first= Richard|authorlink=Richard Taruskin| |date=2010|title=Spotlight On|work=The Oxford History of Western Music|volume= 2|publisher= Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry Cooper (2011, p.38) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Barry|title= Beethoven's Uses of Silence|journal=The Musical Times|volume=  152|issue= 1914 |date=Spring 2011|pages=25-43 |jstor=23039954}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes extensively of [[Beethoven]]'s many uses of silence for contemplation, for dramatic effect and especially for driving the rhythmic impetus of the music. He cites the start of the second movement of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]], where the silences contribute to a powerful sense of propulsion: "The rhythm of bar 1 is incomplete and demands a note at the beginning of bar 2. The substitution of such a note by a whole-bar rest therefore gives the effect of a suppressed sound, as if one were about to speak but then refrains at the last moment. The 'suppressed sound' is then repeated in bar 4, and 'developed' (by being doubled) in bars 7 and 8." {{harvtxt|Grove|1898|p=355}} writes of the "strange irregularity of rhythm in the sixth bar" of this movement.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, G. (1898, p.355) ''Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies''.  London, Novello.  Reprinted by Dover (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Beethoven 9 scherzo.png|thumb|center|500px|The opening bars of the ''[[scherzo]]'' from Beethoven's ninth symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTdQECUTDu8|title=Ludwig van Beethoven - Molto Vivace (SinfonÃ­a NÂº9, Op. 125)|first=|last=Jedioberon|date=27 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Much has been said about the [[Tristan chord|harmony]] of the opening to [[Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'', which Taruskin (2010, p.540) calls "perhaps the most famous, surely the most commented-on, single phrase of music ever written."  However, Wagnerâs strategic use of silences between phrases intensifies the troubled ambiguity of the music: "The chord that fills the ensuing silence in the listenerâs inner earâ¦ is the unstated â indeed never to be stated, and ultimately needless to be stated â tonic of that key."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Taruskin|Taruskin, Richard]] (2010) The Oxford History of Western Music, Volume 3. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{listen|type=music|filename=Wagner Tristan opening (orchestral).ogg|title=''Tristan und Isolde'' (opening bars)|description=Performed by the [[Fulda Symphonic Orchestra]]}}[[File:Tristan opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Wagner, Prelude to ''Tristan and Isolde'', opening bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAULLxcWSpM|title=[HD] Richard Wagner - Tristan Und Isolde - Prelude - Daniel Barenboim, Bayreuth Festival|first=|last=Above the Mists|date=9 December 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Some of the most effective musical silences are very short, lasting barely a fraction of a second. In the spirited and energetic finale of his [[Brahms Symphony No. 2|Symphony No. 2]], [[Brahms]] uses silences at several points to powerfully disrupt the rhythmic momentum that has been building. (See also [[syncopation]].)

During the 20th century, composers explored further the expressive potential of silence in their music.&lt;ref&gt;Lossef, N. and Doctor, J. (eds.) (2007) Silence, Music, Silent Music. London, Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; The contemplative concluding bars of Anton [[Webern]]âs ''Symphony''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVrCpylDGS8&amp;t=2m32s|title=Anton Webern: Simfonija op. 21., 2. stavak: Variationen|first=|last=dorotea1997|date=26 November 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1928) and [[Stravinsky]]âs ''[[Les Noces]]'' The Wedding, 1923)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNBDJNHeZmo&amp;t=24m05s|title=Igor Stravinsky - Les Noces (1923)|first=|last=Bartje Bartmans|date=1 August 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; make telling and atmospheric use of pauses. Eric Walter White (1947, p.74) describes the ending of ''[[Les Noces]]'' as follows: "As the voices cease singing, pools of silence come flooding in between the measured strokes of the bell chord, and the music dies away in a miraculously fresh and radiant close."&lt;ref&gt;White, E.W. (1947) ''Stravinsky: a Critical Survey''.  London, John Lehmann.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Paynter (composer)|John Paynter]] (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;24) vividly conveys how silence contributes to the titanic impact of the third section&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f4qdJHatNM&amp;t=12m20s|title=Messiaen - Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum|first=|last=orangejamtw|date=16 October 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Messiaen]]âs orchestral work ''[[Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum]]'' (1964):&lt;blockquote&gt;Woodwinds jump, growl and shriek. Silence. Eight solemn bell strokes echo and die. Again silence. Suddenly the brasses blare, and out of the trombonesâ awesome processional grows a steady roar â¦ the big gongs the tam-tam beaten in a long and powerful resonance, shattering and echoing across mountains and along valleys. This is music of the high hills, music for vast spaces: âThe hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of Godâ. We can feel the awe and the majesty of the High Alps and the great churches. The instrumental sounds are vast the silences are deep. The words of St John are alive in the music, and through these sounds Messiaen reveals himself and his vision.&lt;ref name="Paynter, J. 1970" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;An extreme example from 1952 is ''[[4â²33â³]]'', an [[experimental music]]al work by [[avant-garde composer]] [[John Cage]], incorporating ambient sounds not foreseeable by the composer. Though first performed on the [[piano]], the piece was composed for any instrument or instruments and is structured in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s. The length of each movement is not fixed by the composer, but the total length of the combination of three movements is. The score instructs the performer(s) to remain silent throughout the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTEFKFiXSx4|title=John Cage's 4'33"|first=|last=Joel Hochberg|date=15 December 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cage, J.(1952),  4â33", Published by Edition Peters (PE.P06777)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are telling examples of the use of silence in jazz. A frequently used effect, known as "[[stop-time]]", places silences at moments where listeners or dancers might expect a strong beat, contributing to the [[syncopation]]. [[Scott Joplin]]'s ''[[The Ragtime Dance|Rag-Time Dance]]'' (1902) features stop-time silences:
[[File:Rag-Time Dance.png|thumb|center|500px|Scott Joplin, ''Rag-Time Dance'' (1902)]]

Early recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unGmMmD8kPQ&amp;t=2m13s|title=The Ragtime Dance - SCOTT JOPLIN (1906)|first=|last=RagtimeDorianHenry|date=27 June 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the ''Rag Time Dance'' follow Joplinâs instructions as follows: "To get the desired effect of 'Stop Time', the pianist will please stamp the heel of one foot heavily upon the floor."&lt;ref&gt;Joplin, S. (1971) ''Collected Piano Works: Rags, Waltzes and Marches''. New York Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, later recordings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImJ1jqLYfGk&amp;t=7m22s|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; disregard this direction â the regular beat is implied rather than stated and the silences are more palpable. Keith Swanwick (1979, p.70) is enchanted by the "playfulness and humour" engendered by the stop-time effects in [[Jelly Roll Morton]]'s solo piano recording of ''The Crave'' (1939):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k8QokoPPrU&amp;t=1m24s|title=THE CRAVE by Jelly Roll Morton - NEW ORLEANS MEMORIES 1939|first=|last=cdbpdx|date=5 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; "If we listen to this, tapping or clicking along with the beat, we shalt find ourselves surprised by two patches of silence near the end. The beat goes on but the sound stops. The effect is something like being thrown forward when a car stops suddenly. It is the biggest surprise in an engaging piece of music full of little deviations ([[syncopation]]s) from the repeated beat."&lt;ref&gt;Swanwick, K. (1979) A Basis for Music Education.  London, Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include the closing bars of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s recording of ''Struttin' with Some Barbecue'' (1928)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yl-2R_Pb7dk&amp;t=2m46s|title=Louis Armstrong - Struttin' With Some Barbecue|first=|last=Praguedive|date=20 June 2009|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the hair's-breadth pause at the end of pianist [[Bill Evans]]' solo on [[Miles Davis]]' recording of [[On Green Dolphin Street (song)|''On Green Dolphin Street'']] (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGVdAlxlp18&amp;t=8m20s|title=Miles Davis - On Green Dolphin Street (Audio)|first=|last=MilesDavisVEVO|date=14 May 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Duke Ellington]]'s "Madness in Great Ones", from his Shakespearean Suite ''[[Such Sweet Thunder]]'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhpqIMor2P8|title=Duke Ellington - Such Sweet Thunder - Madness in Great Ones.|first=|last=bill K|date=21 October 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; conveys the feigned madness of Prince Hamlet through abrupt and unpredictable pauses that interrupt the flow of the music. The [[reggae]] band [[Black Slate]] had a hit in 1980 with the song ''Amigo''. The instrumental introduction features sudden silences before the voice enters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux7O3wufbQY|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1444">In mathematics, Weinstein's '''symplectic category''' is (roughly) a [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are [[symplectic manifold]]s and whose morphisms are '''canonical relations''', inclusions of [[Lagrangian submanifold]]s ''L'' into &lt;math&gt;M \times N^{-}&lt;/math&gt;, where the superscript minus means minus the given symplectic form (for example, the graph of a [[symplectomorphism]]; hence, minus). The notion was introduced by [[Alan Weinstein]], according to whom "Quantization problems&lt;ref&gt;He means [[geometric quantization]].&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that the category of symplectic manifolds and symplectomorphisms be augmented by the inclusion of canonical relations as morphisms." The composition of canonical relations is given by a [[fiber product]].

Strictly speaking, the symplectic category is not a well-defined category (since the composition may not be well-defined) without some transversality conditions.

The '''Three Ages of Buddhism''', also known as the Three Ages of the Dharma, ({{zh|s=ä¸æ¶|t=ä¸æ|p=SÄn ShÃ­}}) are three divisions of time following Buddha's passing in [[East Asian Buddhism]]. '''MappÅ''' or '''Mofa''' ({{zh|s=æ«æ³|t=æ«æ³||p=MÃ² FÇ}}, Japanese: ''MappÅ''), which is also translated as the ''Age of Dharma Decline'', is the "degenerate" Third Age of Buddhism, also known as The Latter Day of the Law.

# Middle Day of the Law â also known as the Age of Semblance Dharma ({{zh|s=åæ³|t=åæ³|p=XiÃ ng FÇ}}; Jp: zÅhÅ), the second thousand years (or 500 years), which only resembles the right Dharma; 
# Latter Day of the Law â also known as the Degenerate Age ({{zh|s=æ«æ³|t=æ«æ³|p=MÃ² FÇ}}; mÃ²fÇ; Jp: mappÅ), which is to last for 10,000 years during which the Dharma declines.

The three periods are significant to [[Mahayana]] adherents, particularly those who hold the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' in high regard, namely the [[Tiantai]] and [[Tendai]] and [[Nichiren Buddhism]], who believe that different Buddhist teachings are valid (i.e., able to lead practitioners to enlightenment) in each period due to the different capacity to accept a teaching (æ©æ ¹ Cn: jÄ«gÄn; Jp: kikon) of the people born in each respective period.

Further, in the ''[[Mahasamnipata Sutra|MahÄsaá¹nipÄta Sutra]]'', the three periods are further divided into five five-hundred year periods (äºäºç¾æ­³ Cn: wÇ wÇ bÇi sÃ¹i; Jp: go no gohyaku sai), the fifth and last of which was prophesied to be when the Buddhism of Sakyamuni would lose all power of salvation and a new Buddha would appear to save the people. This time period would be characterized by unrest, strife, famine, and natural disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Marra, Michele (1988).

==Latter Day of the Law==

===Degeneration===
Traditionally, this age is supposed to begin 2000 years after [[Gautama Buddha]]'s passing and last for "10,000 years". The first two ages are the ''Age of Right Dharma'' (æ­£æ³ Cn: zhÃ¨ngfÇ; Jp: shÅbÅ), followed by the ''Age of Semblance Dharma'' ({{cjkv|c=åæ³|p=xiÃ ngfÇ}}, Japanese: ''zÅbÅ'').{{harv|Hattori|2000|pp=15, 16}} During this degenerate third age, it is believed that people will be unable to attain enlightenment through the word of Sakyamuni Buddha, and society will become morally corrupt. In Buddhist thought, during the Age of Dharma Decline the teachings of the Buddha will still be correct, but people will no longer be capable of following them.

===Maitreya===
Buddhist temporal cosmology assumes a cyclical pattern of ages, and even when the current Buddha's teachings fall into disregard, a new Buddha will at some point (usually considered to be millions of years in the future) be born to ensure the continuity of Buddhism. In the ''Lotus Sutra'', [[Visistacaritra]] is entrusted to spread Buddhist law in this age and save mankind and the earth. He and countless other Bodhisattvas, specifically called Bodhisattvas of the Earth (of which he is the leader), vow to be reborn in a latter day to re-create Buddhist law, thus turning the degenerate age into a flourishing paradise. Shakyamuni entrusts them instead of his more commonly known major disciples with this task since the Bodhisattvas of the Earth have had a karmic connection with Shakyamuni since the beginning of time, meaning that they are aware of the Superior Practice which is the essence of Buddhism or the Dharma in its original, pure form. [[Ksitigarbha]] is also known for his vow to take responsibility for the instruction of all beings in the six worlds, in the era between the death of Gautama and the rise of [[Maitreya]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cttbusa.org/ess/earthstore_contents.htm The Earth Store (Treasury) Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|info="Is this sentence about something that happens in 3rd age?

[[Theravada]] Buddhists taught that Buddhism would decline in five thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dicks |first1=Andrew |date=May 2015 |title=Enlightening the Bats: Sound and Place Making in Burmese Buddhist Practice |pages=25-26 and 32-33 |quote=pp 25-26:Many of the Burmese Buddhists I spoke with referenced a five thousand year period of decline noting that the current sÄsana of the Buddha Sakyamuni who lived in India during the 5th century BCE, is already half way towards its complete disintegration. As time passes after the death of a Buddha, the sÄsana becomes increasingly opaque until it finally disappears. There may be a period with no Buddha, and then a future Buddha descends from the celestial abodes, is born, and restores the sÄsana on earth once again. Burmese Buddhist historian, Alicia Turner, has identified multiple chronologies for the decline of the sÄsana that range from one hundred to five thousand years (2014). In the time of decay, also known as the Kaliyuga, all traces of the Tipitaka and their supporting practices eventually vanish destabilizing the sÄsana and triggering its dissolution. pp 32-33:The Angata vamsa (dating to roughly 13th century) specifically depicts five stages in the decline of the sÄsana. The first stage articulates the loss of the ability for monks to reach the four stages of enlightenment: sotapanna (stream-enterer), sakadagami (once-returner), anagami (non-returner), and arahant (fully awakened). The second stage relates the loss of patipatti (practice). In this stage, monks lose the ability to meditate and maintain their precepts. The loss of pariyatti (textual study) is the third stage and depicts the disappearance of the Tipitaka. The fourth stage illustrates the loss of maintaining even appearances of piousness i.e. respectful speech, attire, work, and morals. In this stage, monks no longer behave as monks. They are illustrated as married and working people. The final stage illustrates the disappearance of the Buddhaâs relics as they are returned to the location of the Buddhaâs enlightenment and engulfed in flames (ibid.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By contrast, refer to Bhikku Bodhi : {{cite book |translator-last=Bhikkhu Bodhi |date=2012 |title=The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha - A Translation of the Anguttara Nikaya |pages=1805 |quote=cf Note 1747- And this expression 'a thousand years' is said with reference to arahants who have attained the analytic knowledges.  Following this, for another thousand years, there appear dry-insight arahants; for another thousand years, non-returners; for another thousand years, once-returners; for another thousand years, stream-enterers.  Thus the good Dhamma of penetration will last five thousand years.  The Dhamma of learning will also last this long.  For without learning, there is no penetration, and as long as there is learning, there is penetration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some monks such as [[DÅgen]] and [[Hsu Yun]] had alternative views regarding dharma decline. DÅgen believed that there is no MÃ² FÇ while Hsu Yun thought MÃ² FÇ is not inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china2551.org/Article/fjll/l19/200807/7129.html ä½ææ«æ³è§çç°ä»£æä¹]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cttbusa.org/dharmatalks/properdharma.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15229">[[File:Schizophrenia PET scan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The relevant question: what will research discover? Can "types" of mental states be meaningfully described by "types" of physical events ('''type physicalism'''), or is there some other problem with this pursuit?]]
'''Type physicalism''' (also known as '''reductive materialism''', '''type identity theory''',  '''mindâbrain identity theory''' and '''identity theory of mind''') is a [[physicalism|physicalist]] theory, in the [[philosophy of mind]]. It asserts that [[mental event]]s can be grouped into types, and can then be [[correlation|correlated]] with types of physical events in the brain. For example, one type of mental event, such as "mental pains" will, presumably, turn out to be describing one type of physical event (like [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fiber]] firings).

Type physicalism is contrasted by [[anomalous monism|token identity]] physicalism, which argues that mental events are unlikely to have "steady" or categorical biological correlates. These positions make use of the philosophical [[typeâtoken distinction]] (e.g., Two persons having the same "type" of car need not mean that they share a "token", a single vehicle). Type physicalism can now be understood to argue that there is identicalness between types, whereas token identity physicalism says one can only describe a particular, unique, brain event.

There are other ways a physicalist might criticize type physicalism; [[eliminative materialism]] and [[revisionary materialism]] question whether science is currently using the best categorisations. In the same way talk of [[demonic possession]] was questioned with scientific advance, categorisations like "pain" may need to be revised.

==Background==
According to [[Ullin Place|U. T. Place]],&lt;ref&gt;Place, Ullin (1956).&lt;/ref&gt; one of the popularizers of the idea of type-identity in the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of type-identity physicalism originated in the 1930s with the psychologist [[E. G. Boring]] and took nearly a quarter of a century to gain acceptance from the philosophical community. Boring, in a book entitled ''The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness'' (1933) wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To the author a perfect correlation is identity. Two events that always occur together at the same time in the same place, without any temporal or spatial differentiation at all, are not two events but the same event. The mind-body correlations as formulated at present, do not admit of spatial correlation, so they reduce to matters of simple correlation in time. The need for identification is no less urgent in this case (p. 16, quoted in Place [unpublished]).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The barrier to the acceptance of any such vision of the mind, according to Place, was that philosophers and logicians had not yet taken a substantial interest in questions of identity and referential identification in general. The dominant [[epistemology]] of the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] at that time was [[phenomenalism]], in the guise of the theory of sense-data. Indeed, Boring himself subscribed to the phenomenalist creed, attempting to reconcile it with an identity theory and this resulted in a ''reductio ad absurdum'' of the identity theory, since brain states would have turned out, on this analysis, to be identical to colors, shapes, tones and other sensory experiences.

The revival of interest in the work of [[Gottlob Frege]] and his ideas of [[sense]] and [[reference]] on the part of [[Herbert Feigl]] and [[J.J.C. Smart]], along with the discrediting of phenomenalism through the influence of the later [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[J.L. Austin]], led to a more tolerant climate toward physicalistic and realist ideas. [[Behaviorism|Logical behaviorism]] emerged as a serious contender to take the place of the Cartesian "[[ghost in the machine]]" and, although not lasting very long as a dominant position on the mind/body problem, its elimination of the whole realm of internal mental events was strongly influential in the formation and acceptance of the thesis of type identity.

==Versions of type identity theory==
There were actually subtle but interesting differences between the three most widely credited formulations of the type-identity thesis, those of Place, Feigl and Smart which were published in several articles in the late 1950s. However, all of the versions share the central idea that the mind is identical to something physical.

===U. T. Place===
{{main|Ullin Place}}
U. T. Place's (1956) notion of the relation of identity was derived from [[Bertrand Russell]]'s distinction among several types of ''is'' statements:{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} the ''is'' of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]], the ''is'' of equality and the ''is'' of composition. Place's version of the relation of identity is more accurately described as a relation of composition. For Place, higher-level mental events are composed out of lower-level physical events and will eventually be analytically reduced to these. So, to the objection that "sensations" do not mean the same thing as "mental processes", Place could simply reply with the example that "lightning" does not mean the same thing as "electrical discharge" since we determine that something is lightning by looking and seeing it, whereas we determine that something is an electrical discharge through experimentation and testing. Nevertheless, "lightning is an electrical discharge" is true since the one is composed of the other.

===Feigl and Smart===
For [[Herbert Feigl|Feigl]] (1957) and [[J. J. C. Smart|Smart]] (1959), on the other hand, the identity was to be interpreted as the identity between the referents of two descriptions (senses) which referred to the same thing, as in "the morning star" and "the evening star" both referring to Venus, a necessary identity. So to the objection about the lack of equality of meaning between "sensation" and "brain process", their response was to invoke this Fregean distinction: "sensations" and "brain" processes do indeed ''mean'' different things but they refer to the same physical phenomenon. Moreover, "sensations are brain processes" is a contingent, not a necessary, identity.

==Criticism and replies==

===Multiple realizability===
{{main|Multiple realizability}}
One of the most influential and common objections to the type identity theory is the argument from [[multiple realizability]]. The multiple realizability thesis asserts that mental states can be realized in multiple kinds of systems, not just brains, for example.  Since the identity theory identifies mental events with certain brain states, it does not allow for mental states to be realized in organisms or computational systems that do not have a brain. This is in effect an argument that the identity theory is too narrow because it does not allow for organisms without brains to have mental states. However, ''token identity'' (where only particular tokens of mental states are identical with particular tokens of physical events) and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] both account for multiple realizability.

The response of type identity theorists, such as Smart, to this objection is that, while it may be true that mental events are multiply realizable, this does not demonstrate the falsity of type identity. As Smart states:

:"The functionalist second order [causal] state is a state of having some first order state or other which ''causes'' or is ''caused by'' the behavior to which the functionalist alludes. In this way we have a second order type theory."&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;Smart, J. J. C., 2007, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mind-identity/ "The Mind/Brain Identity Theory"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental point is that it is extremely difficult to determine where, on the continuum of first order processes, type identity ends and merely token identities begin. Take Quine's example of English country gardens. In such gardens, the tops of hedges are cut into various shapes, for example the shape of an elf. We can make generalizations over the type ''elf-shaped hedge'' only if we abstract away from the concrete details of the individual twigs and branches of each hedge. So, whether we say that two things are of the same type or are tokens of the same type because of subtle differences is just a matter of descriptive abstraction. The type-token distinction is not all or nothing.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]]&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary, 1967. "Psychological Predicates," in W. H. Capitan and D. D. Merrill (eds.), ''Art, Mind, and Religion'', Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, pp. 37â48; Putnam, Hilary. ''Representation and Reality''. 1988. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiple-realizability/ "Multiple Realizability" entry at Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by John Bickle].&lt;/ref&gt; essentially rejects functionalism because, he believes, it is indeed a second-order type identity theory. Putnam uses multiple realizability against functionalism itself, suggesting that mental events (or kinds, in Putnam's terminology) may be diversely implemented by diverse functional/computational kinds; there may be only a token identification between particular mental kinds and particular functional kinds. Putnam, and many others who have followed him, now tend to identify themselves as generically [[Physicalism#Non-reductive physicalism|non-reductive physicalists]].  Putnam's invocation of multiple realizability does not, of course, directly answer the problem raised by Smart with respect to useful generalizations over types and the flexible nature of the type-token distinction in relation to causal taxonomies in science.

===Qualia===
{{main|Qualia}}
Another frequent objection is that type identity theories fail to account for phenomenal mental states (or [[qualia]]), such as having a pain, feeling sad, experiencing nausea. (Qualia are merely the subjective qualities of [[consciousness|conscious experience]]. An example is the way the pain of jarring ones elbow ''feels'' to the individual.) Arguments can be found in Saul Kripke (1972) and David Chalmers (1996), for example, according to which the identity theorist cannot identify phenomenal mental states with brain states (or any other physical state for that matter) because one has a sort of direct awareness of the nature of such qualitative mental states, and their nature is qualitative in a way that brain states are not.

A famous formulation of the qualia objection comes from [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] (1982) in the form of the [[Knowledge argument|Mary's room]] thought experiment. Let us suppose, Jackson suggests, that a particularly brilliant super-scientist named Mary has been locked away in a completely black-and-white room her entire life. Over the years in her colour-deprived world she has studied (via black-and-white books and television) the sciences of neurophysiology, vision and electromagnetics to their fullest extent; eventually Mary comes to know all the physical facts there are to know about experiencing colour. When Mary is released from her room and experiences colour for the first time, does she learn something new? If we answer "yes" (as Jackson suggests we do) to this question, then we have supposedly denied the truth of type physicalism, for if Mary has exhausted all the physical facts about experiencing colour prior to her release, then her subsequently acquiring some new piece of information about colour upon experiencing its [[quale]] reveals that there must be something about the experience of colour which is not captured by the physicalist picture. (See [[Mary's room]] page for full discussion).

The type identity theorist, such as Smart, attempts to explain away such phenomena by insisting that the experiential properties of mental events are ''topic-neutral''. The concept of topic-neutral terms and expressions goes back to [[Gilbert Ryle]], who identified such topic-neutral terms as "if", "or", "not", "because" and "and." If one were to hear these terms alone in the course of a conversation, it would be impossible to tell whether the topic under discussion concerned geology, physics, history, gardening, or selling pizza. For the identity theorist, sense-data and qualia are not real things in the brain (or the physical world in general) but are more like "the average electrician." The average electrician can be further analyzed and explained in terms of real electricians but is not itself a real electrician.

'''Universal mind''' or '''universal consciousness''' is a concept that tries to address the underlying essence of all being and becoming in the universe. It includes the being and becoming that occurred in the universe prior to the arising of the concept of "Mind", a term that more appropriately refers to the organic, human, aspect of universal consciousness. It addresses inorganic being and becoming and the interactions that occur in that process without specific reference to the physical and chemical laws that try to describe those interactions. Those interactions have occurred, do occur, and continue to occur. Universal consciousness is the source, ground, basis, that underlies those interactions and the awareness and knowledge they imply.

==Introduction==

The concept of universal mind was presented by [[Anaxagoras]], a [[Pre-Socratic philosopher]] who arrived in Athens some time after 480 BC. He taught that the growth of living things depends on the power of mind within the organisms that enables them to extract nourishment from surrounding substances. For this concept of mind, Anaxagoras was commended by [[Aristotle]]. Both [[Plato]] and Aristotle, however, objected that his notion of mind did not include a view that mind acts ethically, i.e. acts for the âbest interestsâ of the universe.[1]

The most original aspect of Anaxagoras's system was his doctrine of ''[[nous]]'' ("mind" or "reason"). [2] A different Greek word, ''gnÃ³Ì±siÌ±'' (awareness), better reflects what is observed in the wider world of organic and inorganic being than just the human world. A worm, an amoeba, a bacteria, a raindrop, appears to act with "awareness" (''gnÃ³Ì±siÌ±'') rather than "reason" (''nous''). Also, these actions would not commonly be referred to as being "reasonable" or "ethical".

In "The Huang Po Doctrine of Universal Mind", originated in around 857 CE, the idea of mind was disconnected from soul in this Buddhist school of thought.

[[Chu Châan]] says, âUniversal mind, therefore, is something to which nothing can be attributed. Being absolute, it is beyond attributes. If for example, it were to be described as infinite, that would exclude from it whatever is finite, but the whole argument of the book is that universal mind is the only reality and that everything we apprehend through our senses, is nothing else but this mind. Even to think of it in terms of existence or non-existence is to misapprehend it entirely.â pp.&amp;nbsp;8â9â[3]

The term surfaced again in later philosophy, as in the writings of Hegel. - Hegel writes:
{{quote|Â¤ 377  The knowledge of Mind is the highest and hardest, just because it is the most 'concrete' of sciences. The significance of that 'absolute' commandment, Know thyself â whether we look at it in itself or under the historical circumstances of its first utterance â is not  to promote mere selfâknowledge in respect of the particular capacities, character, propensities, and foibles of the single self. The knowledge it commands means that of man's genuine reality â of what is  essentially and ultimately true and real â of mind as the true and  essential being.â [4]}}

==Definitions==
[[Ernest Holmes]], the founder of the [[Science of Mind]] movement, described the universal mind as follows: 
{{quote|The Universal Mind contains all knowledge. It is the potential ultimate of all things. To It all things are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Ernest|title=The Science of Mind|date=1953|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[New Thought]] author [[Charles F. Haanel|Charles Haanel]] said of the universal mind and its relationship to humans:
{{quote|The Universal Mind, being infinite and omnipotent, has unlimited resources at its command, and when we remember that it is also omnipresent, we cannot escape the conclusion that we must be an expression or manifestation of that Mind. A recognition and understanding of the resources of the subconscious mind will indicate that the only difference between the subconscious and the Universal is one of degree. They differ only as a drop of water differs from the ocean. They are the same in kind and quality, the difference is one of degree only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haanel|first1=Charles|title=The Master Key System, chapter 14, section 20.|date=1912|isbn=978-1-61720-383-1|page=101|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/haanel-charles/Master-Key-System/audioEbook/master-key-systemRAW.pdf|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The nature of the universal mind is said to be [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnipresence|omnipresent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''The Master Key System'', by Charles Haanel, Chapter 1, section 30|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/haanel-charles/Master-Key-System/audioEbook/master-key-systemRAW.pdf|publisher=The New Thought Library|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological interpretation==
Universal mind may be viewed from a scientific perspective as [[:wikt:nonlocal|non-local]] consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu H, Wu M |date=2013 |title=Human Consciousness as Limited Version of Universal Consciousness |url=http://jcer.com/index.php/jcj/article/viewFile/281/309 |journal=Journal of Consciousness Exploration &amp; Research |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=52â68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable fringe source|date=January 2017}} [[Michael Persinger]] wrote on non-local consciousness:
{{Quote|text=[a]s a human being, I am concerned about the illusionary explanations for human consciousness and the future of human existence. Consequently after writing the Neuropsychological Base of God Beliefs (1987), I began the systematic application of complex electromagnetic fields to discern the patterns that will induce experiences (sensed presence) that are attributed to the myriad of ego-alien intrusions which range from gods to aliens. The research is not to demean anyone's religious/mystical experience but instead to determine which portions of the brain or its electromagnetic patterns generate the experience|sign=[[Michael Persinger]]|source=''in Huping Hu &amp; Maoxin Wu ''}}{{Unreliable fringe source|date=January 2017}}

The atemporal nature of consciousness{{clarify|date=January 2017}} is explored by Mansoor Malik and Maria Hipolito.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Malik Monsoor |author2=Hipolito Maria |date=2010 |title=Time and its Relationship to Consciousness An Overview

{{Quote|text=Freud emphasized the timelessness of unconscious processes. He showed how unconscious ignores time and temporal progression. For example, in dreams and fantasy where past, present, and future are united in one representation, he showed that certain aspects of psychopathology are also essentially atemporal.}}

{{Quote|text=Hameroff (1996) conceptualizes consciousness as successive quantum superposition of the tubulin protein conformations in the brain. He proposes that with each conscious moment, âa new organization of Planck scale geometry is selected irreversiblyâ. This leads to apparent illusion of time. Thus without consciousness, there would be no time.}}

The '''utility monster''' is a [[thought experiment]] in the study of [[ethics]] created by [[philosopher]] [[Robert Nozick]] in 1974 as a criticism of [[utilitarianism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science &amp; Mathematics|date=March 20, 2015|publisher=AMF|isbn=9781329003422|edition=First|page=322|last1=Kennard|first1=Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The thought experiment==
A hypothetical being, which Nozick calls the ''utility monster,'' receives much more [[utility]] from each unit of a resource they consume than anyone else does. For instance, eating a [[cookie]] might bring only one unit of pleasure to an ordinary person but could bring 100 units of pleasure to a utility monster. If the utility monster can get so much pleasure from each unit of resources, it follows from utilitarianism that the distribution of resources should acknowledge this. If the utility monster existed, it would justify the mistreatment and perhaps annihilation of everyone else, according to the mandates of utilitarianism, because, for the utility monster, the pleasure they receive outweighs the suffering they may cause.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nozick writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Utilitarian theory is embarrassed by the possibility of utility monsters who get enormously greater sums of utility from any sacrifice of others than these others lose ... the theory seems to require that we all be sacrificed in the monster's maw, in order to increase total utility.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anarchy, State, and Utopia|last=Nozick|first=Robert|publisher=|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=41|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;This thought experiment attempts to show that utilitarianism is not actually [[egalitarian]], even though it appears to be at first glance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The experiment contends that there is no way of aggregating utility which can circumvent the conclusion that all units should be given to a utility monster, because every different system has a monster and defeating one utility monster creates another. For example, in [[Minimax#Maximin in philosophy|Rawls' maximin]] or [[Justice as Fairness#The Difference Principle|difference principle]], maximin sets a group's aggregate utility as that of the being with least utility. Thus, giving units to the utility monster fails to change the group's utility unless the utility monster has the least utility.{{Clarify|Which utility monster?|date=May 2014}} Even if the utility monster has the least utility, maximin would only prefer allocating units to the monster until it catches up with the member that has next-to-least utility. This would defeat the "happy" utility monster of average utility. But if the person who has the least utility gains only a tiny amount of utility from each unit of resources, they may never catch up with the next person, so they can similarly consume all of the resources in the world. It can be shown that all consequentialist systems based on maximizing a global function are subject to utility monsters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
Robert Nozick, a twentieth century American philosopher, coined the term "utility monster" in response to Jeremy Bentham's philosophy of [[utilitarianism]]. Nozick proposed that accepting the theory of utilitarianism causes the necessary acceptance of the condition that some people would use this to justify exploitation of others. An individual (or specific group) would claim their entitlement to more "happy units" than they claim others deserve, and the others would consequently be left to receive fewer "happy units".

Nozick deems these exploiters "utility monsters" (and for ease of understanding, they might also be thought of as happiness hogs). Nozick poses utility monsters justify their greediness with the notion that, compared to others, they experience greater inequality or sadness in the world, and deserve more happy units to bridge this gap. People not part of the utility monster group (or not the utility monster individual themselves) are left with less happy units to be split among the members. Utility monsters state that the others are happier in the world to begin with, so they would not need those extra happy units to which they lay claim anyway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Social implications==

===Free speech===
The utility monster has been invoked in debates about [[free speech]]. Advocates for laws against [[hate speech]], [[flag-burning]], and [[blasphemy]] have been accused of becoming utility monsters in order to increase society's willingness to support their policies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa652.pdf|title=Attack of the Utility Monsters: The New Threats to Free Speech|last=Kuznicki|first=Jason|date=November 16, 2009|website=Cato Institute|publisher=Cato Institute|access-date=October 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population===
The utility monster has been invoked in debates about population. [[Derek Parfit]]'s [[mere addition paradox]] suggests that additional humans would add to total happiness, even if expanding population decreases average happiness. Opposite reasoning yields the "[[repugnant conclusion]]" that the world would be better off with one extremely happy person. Parfit suggests that Nozick's utility monster is misleading because it appeals to our intuitions about a being which experiences more than a million times the utility of a very well-off ordinary person, which is, he thinks, inconceivable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Derek Parfit]], "[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/PHIL4260/Parfit%20-%20'Overpopulation%20and%20the%20Quality%20of%20Life'.pdf Overpopulation and the quality of life]", in ''The Repugnant Conclusion'', J. Ryberg and T. TÃ¤nnsjÃ¶, eds., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is a more common-sense continuous scale of happiness change, from great to nil, based on scarcity of units, the happiness increasing from an additional unit of resource only inversely proportional to the existing pool of units.

=== Relevance ===
The reason this can come to be, and the reason the utility monster is a condition of utilitarianism in effect, is because the philosophy necessarily begs the question of how to measure happiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A person can be in much grief, but there is no physical way to measure the lack of happiness they experience, and whether this is greater or less than a person who is enduring a different pain, like physical torture. Rephrased, this brings to light the question of which person is more deserving and which person is less deserving of happiness units based on life experiences. Individuals must take other's word regarding how much happiness they each possess, and the happiness they should therefore be able to lay claim.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is a common idea among people that hurt individuals deserve compensation for their pain. Yet Nozick's utility monster would take advantage of this reward process, by proclaiming their pain is the greatest and most deserving of reward.

Jason Kuznicki argues the reverse is true. According to Kuznicki, this proposed justification negatively affects society, because people's demand for equal payment for life's pain creates these utility monsters. One such group he suggests comes in the form of people who seek political correctness. He states that these folks butcher other people's right to free speech, under the pretense that it causes their group (or their individual) pain. He states that it is unjustifiable that pain one causes another is greater than someone else's. He thus provides the example of censorship, where if one person finds a certain censorship offensive, while others do not, who's to say that the offended person's hurt is worthy of a law of censorship of that material to be created?&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Specifically, "''If 'feelings of upset' are to be taken into account in shaping our laws, why do my feelings, and the feelings of other libertarians, always count for nothing?''"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''''Way to Go''''' (French: '''''Jusqu'ici''''') is a 2015 Canada/France [[interactive film]] and [[virtual reality]] web-based experience created by the [[Montreal]] digital studio AATOAA ({{Interlanguage link multi|Vincent Morisset|fr}}, Philippe Lambert, Ãdouard LanctÃ´t-Benoit and Caroline Robert) and produced by [[National Film Board of Canada]] ([[Hugues Sweeney]]) and [[France TÃ©lÃ©visions]]. The production lets users take a virtual walk in the woods, through a combination of animation and [[immersive video]].&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/arts/vincent-morisset-will-convince-you-that-websites-are-works-of-art-1.3453962|title=Vincent Morisset will convince you that websites are works of art|last=Collins|first=Leah|date=19 February 2016|work=CBC Arts|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==User experience==
In February 2016, ''[[Animation World Network]]'''s Jennifer Wolfe described the user experience as follows:
{{Quote|Users pilot a block-headed, hand-drawn avatar through the experience, they can pause to examine the world around them, sometimes triggering a strange tunnel vision effect that shifts the perspective to a first-person POV. During the seemingly endless journey, the world oscillates between black-and-white live action and a colored, lo-res digital mode. Eighty-three custom shaders change lights, grain and visual effects in real time while thousands of sounds are live mixed and synced to user interaction. The music score itself, composed by Philippe Lambert, is generative, responding to the viewerâs pace as they amble (or fly) through the forest.&lt;ref name=Wolfe&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/news/nfb-releases-vincent-morisset-s-way-go-online|title=NFB Releases Vincent Morissetâs âWay to Goâ Online|last=Wolfe|first=Jennifer|date=16 February 2016|work=Animation World Network|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
