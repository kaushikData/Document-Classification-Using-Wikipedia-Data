[[File:ATAF.svg|thumb|right|200px|Map of Africa, with members of the African Tax Administration Forum highlighted in green.]]
The '''African Tax Administration Forum''' (ATAF) is an international organisation which provides a platform for cooperation among African tax authorities. First conceived during a meeting of 30 African tax commissioners with representatives of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] in August 2008, it was launched in November 2009 in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African Economic Outlook 2010|year=2010|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-08652-4|authors=African Development Bank,  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development: Development Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aid under pressure: support for development assistance in a global economic downturn|year=2009|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-53051-6|page=143|authors=International Development Committee, House of Commons, UK Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through mutual cooperation between member states, ATAF works towards increasing the level of voluntary tax compliance whilst combating [[tax evasion]] and avoidance. ATAF is supported by a group of donors including the UK's [[Department for International Development]], the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]], the [[African Development Bank]], the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit]], [[Irish Aid]], the [[Ministry for Foreign Affairs (Finland)]], the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Netherlands)]], the [[OECD]], and the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title=Donors |publisher= ATAF |url=http://www.ataftax.org/en/InternationalCo-Operation/Pages/Donors.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; It collaborates with African regional economic organisations, the Commonwealth Association of Tax Administrations, the [[Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations]], the Centre de Rencontres et d'Etudes des Dirigeants des Administrations Fiscales, the [[Intra-European Organisation of Tax Administrations]], and the [[International Centre for Tax and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title=Development Partners |publisher= ATAF |url=http://www.ataftax.org/en/InternationalCo-Operation/Pages/Development-Partners.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member nations ==
As of October 2015, there are 37 member nations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATAF Member Countries|url=http://crm.ataftax.org/member_countries_pub.php|publisher=African Tax Administration Forum|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capacity building==

ATAF offers an online course in tax treaties as well as an executive master's in taxation, in partnership with two Senegalese schools and the [[Mauritius Revenue Authority]]. It also offers short courses on taxation and development in partnership with the [[International Centre for Tax and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= Tax and Development Short Course|publisher= [[Institute of Development Studies]]|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/events/tax-and-development-short-course-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ATAF launched the African Tax Research Network (ATRN), which will hold an annual congress for researchers to share their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= African Tax Research Network Set Up|publisher= The Chronicle |url=http://www.chronicle.co.zw/african-tax-research-network-set-up/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with the [[International Centre for Tax and Development]], it will also offer research methods training and dissemination workshops to members of the ATRN.

==Technical working groups==

ATAF hosts technical working groups on [[Base Erosion and Profit Shifting]], Indirect Taxes, Exchange of Information, and [[Transfer pricing]]. In April 2015 it held a consultative conference on [[BEPS]], and provided feedback from its members to the [[OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= New rules, same old paradigm|publisher= [[The Economist]] |url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21672207-plan-curb-multinationals-tax-avoidance-opportunity-missed-new-rules-same-old}}&lt;/ref&gt; On exchange of information, ATAF has begun a three-year pilot program which aims to help African countries meet the standards to join the [[Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= Exchange of Information|publisher= ATAF|url=http://www.ataftax.org/en/TaxPrograms/Pages/EOI.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conferences==

In October 2015, ATAF held its second international conference on tax in Africa, with the theme "Tax Compliance and Limiting [[Illicit financial flows]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|year=2015 |title= Illicit Financial Flows Grab Limelight at 2nd International Conference on Tax in Africa |publisher= GNN Liberia|url=http://www.ataftax.org/en/TaxPrograms/Pages/EOI.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other members of the group were [[Donato Bellini]] and [[Marco Manzi]]. They achieved a fair amount of success with the single "Fly To Me" in 1985, which reached the Top Ten in several countries. They released two LPs, "Black Out" in 1988 and "Take My Life" in 1989, both originally released on Time Records. The group later released three songs in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.daverodgers.it/SiteNew/html/bio.htm |title=Dave Rodgers - Official Web Site |access-date=2007-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928080828/http://www.daverodgers.it/SiteNew/html/bio.htm |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Aleph Aleph discography at Discogs]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alérion.svg|thumb|right|Heraldic representation]]
An '''avalerion''' or '''alerion''' is a [[mythology|mythological]] bird. It was "rather small, yet larger than an eagle" and  lived near the [[Hydaspes]] and the [[Indus]] according to European medieval geographers and [[bestiaries]], which were possibly based on a description by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Only two of the birds were said to exist at a time. A pair of eggs was laid every 60 years; after hatching, the parents drowned themselves.&lt;ref name="bevan"&gt;Bevan &amp; Phillott, pp. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Blason Lorraine.svg|thumb|left|95px|3 alerions on [[Lorraine]]'s [[arms (heraldry)|arms]]]]
Some [[coats of arms]] include alerions. In [[heraldry]], an alerion is most often depicted as a bird with no beak and feathered stumps in place of legs, or no legs at all.
Notably, the {{Interlanguage link multi|coat of arms of Lorraine|fr|3=Blason de la Lorraine}} features three alerions, because ''alerion'' is a partial [[anagram]] of ''[[Lorraine]]''.

The word's ultimate origin is unclear, possibly adapted from the German ''{{lang|de|{{linktext|Adler}}}}'' (‘eagle’) or ''{{lang|de|{{linktext|Adelar}}}}'' (‘noble eagle’). And it is found in 12th-century French as ''{{lang|fr|alérion}}'' and in [[medieval Latin]] as ''{{lang|la|alariōnem}}'' (a large eagle-like bird).&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|alerion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alerion is also the name of a classicly designed sailboat made in Rhode Island,  which comes in lengths of 20 to 41 feet.  It was the name given by Nathanael Herreshoff (a well known yacht designer at the end of the 19th century) to his personal daysailer; the boats are inspired by his designs.

The '''Bafia languages''' are a clade of [[Bantu language]]s coded Zone A.50 in Guthrie's classification. According to Nurse &amp; Philippson (2003), the languages form a valid node. They are:
:[[Fa’ language|Fa’]] (Lefa), [[Kaalong language|Kaalong]] (Dimbong), [[Kpa language|Kpa]] (Bafia), [[Ngayaba language|Ngayaba]] (Tibea)
[[Hijuk language|Hijuk]] was listed as unclassified A.50 in Guthrie, but according to ''Ethnologue'' it is quite similar to [[Basaa language|Basaa]].

'''Delft Jewelry''' is the generic name for [[jewelry]] featuring Dutch (Netherlands) miniature [[Delftware]] medallions or brooch panels in a silver setting.&lt;ref name=verwoerdceramics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verwoerdceramics.com/delft|title=Verwoerd Ceramics Online|author=Verwoerd Ceramics Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delft jewelry includes necklaces, pendants, earrings, brooches, bracelets, rings, and cufflinks. The Delft panels are usually made of pottery and decorated with a blue and white windmill landscape. The silver setting often has the form of silver [[filigree]]. Delft jewelry has been made in the Netherlands since c.1879.&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, Rick - Royal Delft: a guide to De Porceleyne Fles, p.167 - Schiffer Publishing 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It flourished especially in the decades after WW2 as a result of demand from the Dutch tourist industry. That era saw the emergence of three specialist producers of Delft medallions. For most other Delftware factories however, brooch panels have been a relatively small side product.

The main producers of Delft brooch panels as a side product have been:&lt;ref name=verwoerdceramics/&gt;
* [[De Koninklijke Porceleyne Fles]], Delft

The main specialist producers of Delft brooch panels have been:
*Atelier Van Katwijk, Gouda - established in 1946 by Frans van Katwijk&lt;ref&gt;De Jonge, Leendert - Frans van Katwijk, pp 66-75, p 100 - Zwolle 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*Keramiekatelier C.Verwoerd, Gouda - established in 1949 by [[Cornelis Verwoerd]]
*Kunstatelier Porceletti, Gouda - established in c.1955 by Dick Olthuysen

Delft brooch panels are usually set in silver. The emergence of specialist producers of Delft jewelry in Gouda, Netherlands, was greatly helped by the presence of an important silversmithing community in the nearby town of [[Schoonhoven]]. Zenith Gouda and Goedewaagen Gouda have been suppliers of Delft medallions to silversmith H. Hooykaas of Schoonhoven. Van Katwijk, Verwoerd, and Porceletti have been suppliers of Delft brooch panels to silversmith G.J. Van den Bergh Jr. Several other Schoonhoven silversmiths have been involved in the production of Delft jewelry as well.&lt;ref name=verwoerdceramics/&gt;

'''Sør-Hålogaland''' is a [[diocese]] in the [[Church of Norway]]. The Diocese covers the Lutheran [[Church of Norway]] churches located within [[Nordland]] county in [[Norway]].  The diocese is headquartered in the [[Bodø (town)|town of Bodø]] at [[Bodø Cathedral]], the seat of the presiding Bishop [[Ann-Helen Fjeldstad Jusnes]] (since 2015).  The diocese is divided into eight [[deanery|deaneries]] {{lang|no|(prosti)}}.

==History==
In 1952, the old [[Diocese of Hålogaland]] (which covered all of [[Northern Norway]]) was split into two: the Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland (Nordland county) and the [[Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland]] ([[Troms]], [[Finnmark]], and [[Svalbard]]).

==Bishops==
The bishops of Sør-Hålogaland since its creation in 1952:

*1952–1959: [[Wollert Krohn-Hansen]] 
*1959–1969: [[Hans Edvard Wisløff]]
*1969–1982: [[Bjarne Odd Weider]] 
*1982–1992: [[Fredrik Grønningsæter]] 
*1992–2006: [[Øystein Ingar Larsen]] 
*2007-2015: [[Tor Berger Jørgensen]] 
*Since 2015: [[Ann-Helen Fjeldstad Jusnes]] 

==Cathedral==
{{main|Bodø Cathedral}}
The old church in Bodø was destroyed during [[World War II]], and after the war plans were made to replace the church and make it the cathedral for the new diocese. The foundation stone was laid in 1954 and was consecrated by Bishop [[Wollert Krohn-Hansen]] in 1956. There is also a memorial to those who died in Bodø during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.uit.no/baser/arkinord/categories.php?cat_id=180&amp;l=norwegian|title=Bodø Cathedral|publisher=Arkitekturguide Nordnorge og Svalbard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The Diocese of Sør-Hålogaland is divided into eight [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|prosti}}).  Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese. Each municipality is further divided into one or more [[parish]]es which each contain one or more congregations. See each municipality below for lists of churches and parishes within them.

'''ERT World''' (formerly '''ERT SAT''') is an internationally broadcast Greek-language channel run by [[Greece]]'s national broadcaster [[Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ERT). Programming includes a mix of news, discussion-based programmes, drama, documentaries, entertainment shows as well as sports coverage including live games from Greece's top soccer league, [[Superleague Greece]].

As of June 12, 2013, was disestablished under an order of the Greek Government, as part of austerity measures, along with all of ERT's former TV and radio channels; ET1, NET, ET3, ERT World and the radios ceased to operate from the morning of Wednesday 12 June. As of 3 May 2016, ERT world broadcasts again on Europe.

ERT World created a special program consisting of the best programmes from the three national channels, ERT1, ERT2 and ERT3, and its own specialized programs targeted at the global promotion of Greece. It also used to air programs from [[Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]] (the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] public broadcaster) but discontinued the practice.

Programming is split into two zones - weekday and weekend. On weekdays one can find standard news and information as well as some entertainment shows. On the weekend the focus is mainly on entertainment and sports.

In early 2006, the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation revealed that ERT SAT would be undergoing a major overhaul to allow it to better meet the needs of Greeks abroad. Among the changes are new programmes designed specifically for the ''Omogeneia'' (Greek [[expatriate]]s) and a localized schedule to serve each of the newly designated program 'zones' - North America, Europe/Africa and Asia/Australia. The new program zones were to be launched in the fall of 2006 but as of March 2013 had yet to materialize as the channel still aired programs according to local time in Greece ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]+2).

In August 2010, ERT announced that they had initiated a public bidding process to award the worldwide distribution rights for ERT World. The current rights holder, Comart Telecom declined to renew their agreement with ERT and on August 30, 2010 it was announced that PCCW Global would be awarded the distribution rights temporarily for 1 year until the bidding process was completed and a decision made on the rights holder.

As of March 2013, the distribution rights are held by KBI Implus Hellas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbihellas.com/ KBI Implus Hellas]&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 June 2013, the channel and all the channels of the ERT group were brutally cut shortly before 11 pm (local time). If the terrestrial channels (ERT1, ERT2 and ERT3) resume their broadcasts on 11 June 2015, it is still almost a year before the satellite version of Greek public television resumes broadcasting on the Hot Bird satellite on 3 May 2016 in Europe.

'''Erato''' was a [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] duo consisting of Aida Jašarević and [[Dalal Midhat]]. The band began with five girls but after three members quit due to lack of singing ability, the band became a duo with Jašarević and Midhat continuing on. The band has released two albums; Backstage (2003) and Make Up (2005).&lt;ref name=xkslv&gt;{{cite web|title=Erato (duo) |url=http://www.xklsv.org/viewwiki.php?title=Erato%20(duo) |publisher=xklsv.org |accessdate=3 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103215755/http://www.xklsv.org/viewwiki.php?title=Erato%20(duo) |archivedate=January 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=youtube&gt;{{cite web|title=Erato - Ni jedna suza |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWp11vgG3iI |publisher=youtube.com |accessdate=3 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620071239/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWp11vgG3iI |archivedate=June 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=ovguide&gt;{{cite web|title=Erato Music Videos|url=http://www.ovguide.com/erato-9202a8c04000641f8000000000dedbd5|publisher=ovguide.com|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geopolitical imaginations''' are constructed views of the world that reflect the vision of a place’s, a country’s or a society’s role within world politics. &lt;ref&gt;Güney, Aylin &amp; Gökcan Fulya, [“Greater Middle East as a ‘Modern’ Geopolitical Imagination in the American Foreign Policy”], ''Geopolitics'', 2010. 15 (1): 22-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Geopolitical imaginations are constituted by shared assumptions and representations of power relations and conflicts in world politics within a certain geographical territory. &lt;ref&gt;Latham, Andrew A., [“China in the Contemporary American Geopolitical Imagination”], ''Asian Affairs: An American Review.'', 2001.  28(3): 138-145.&lt;/ref&gt; By critically analyzing how and why these imaginations are constructed, it is possible to reveal underlying power relations and to get a better understanding of various conflicts. Therefore, geopolitical imaginations are closely connected to the academic field of critical geopolitics. &lt;ref&gt;Toal, Gerard, [“Critical geopolitics: The politics of writing global space. Vol. 6”], '' University of Minnesota Press'', 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
Geopolitical imaginations are composed of the representation of a country’s territorial limits and its geopolitical code which is “[...] a set of strategic assumptions that a government makes about other states”. &lt;ref&gt;Güney, Aylin &amp; Gökcan Fulya, [“Greater Middle East as a ‘Modern’ Geopolitical Imagination in the American Foreign Policy”], ''Geopolitics'', 2010. 15 (1): 22-38.&lt;/ref&gt; These so-called geopolitical codes are based on [[national identity]] (particularly in ‘them’ and ‘us’ distinctions), emotional attachment to a place as well as [[National myth|national myths]]. &lt;ref&gt;Güney, Aylin &amp; Gökcan Fulya, [“Greater Middle East as a ‘Modern’ Geopolitical Imagination in the American Foreign Policy”], ''Geopolitics'', 2010. 15 (1): 22-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Geopolitical imaginations provide the legitimisation for geopolitical actions or certain positions in foreign and domestic policy. &lt;ref&gt;Latham, Andrew A., [“China in the Contemporary American Geopolitical Imagination”], ''Asian Affairs: An American Review.'', 2001.  28(3): 138-145.&lt;/ref&gt;
Geopolitical imaginations are reflections of current discourses and therefore they are not fixed but rather vary over time and in different societies. Research has primarily analyzed geopolitical imaginations of European and North American countries, ignoring the fact that in other socio-political contexts there exist different ‘non-western’ geopolitical imaginations. &lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne, ["”A subaltern critical geopolitics of the war on terror: Postcolonial security in Tanzania”"], ''Geoforum'', 2011. 42: 297–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hegemonic geopolitical imaginations in history ==
The view of the world as two polarizing ideological blocs ([[Western Bloc|western]] and [[eastern bloc]]) is a geopolitical imagination which was dominant during time of the [[Cold War]]. Designations such as the [[Iron Curtain]] (the boundary between the bipolar powers) helped to justify certain politics and policies, e.g. in the United States in foreign policy by [[containment]] (a military strategy to stop the expansion of the ‘enemy’) or in domestic policy with the expansion of [[homeland security]] which enforced technologies of control and disciplining. &lt;ref&gt;Reuber, Paul, ["Politische Geographie"], ''Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöning'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Samuel P. Huntington]] made a draft of a fragmented conflicted world order. In his popular hypothesis called ”[[The Clash of Civilizations]]” (1996), he divided the world map geographically into rigid cultural entities, such as the Western bloc, the Islamic bloc or the African bloc, and proclaimed that the next major conflict will occur between these different cultures. &lt;ref&gt;Reuber, Paul, ["Politische Geographie"], ''Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöning'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 21st century, “hegemonic geographical imaginations are dominated by the affective geopolitics of the [[War on Terror]]”. &lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Joanne, ["”A subaltern critical geopolitics of the war on terror: Postcolonial security in Tanzania”"], ''Geoforum'', 2011. 42: 297–305.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been a consequence of the synthesis between the Clash of Civilizations, the terror attacks of 9/11 and the following designations of [[rogue states]] (states which have been blamed for threatening the world peace) and the [[axis of evil]] (states which have been accused of supporting terrorism and aspiring to weapons of mass destruction). &lt;ref&gt;Reuber, Paul, ["Politische Geographie"], ''Paderborn: Ferdinand Schöning'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Juwa Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti Juwa}}, PJ) is a political party in the [[Comoros]].

==History==
The party was established on 30 October 2013 by former President [[Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=281151212&amp;Country=Comoros&amp;topic=Politics&amp;subtopic=Forecast&amp;subsubtopic=Political+stability&amp;u=1&amp;pid=902261274&amp;oid=902261274&amp;uid=1 Former president to stand again in 2016 election] The Economist, 7 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; "Juwa" is the [[Comorian language|Comorian]] word for "Sun"&lt;ref&gt;Tom Lansford (2015) ''Political Handbook of the World 2015'', CQ Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Comorian legislative election, 2015|2015 parliamentary elections]] the Juwa Party emerged as the second-largest faction in the [[Assembly of the Union of the Comoros|Assembly of the Union]], winning seven of the 24 directly-elected seats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comores-actualites.com/non-classe/comores-elections-resultats-de-la-ceni-pour-le-2eme-tour/ Comorian elections: CENI results for the second round!] Comores Actualités, 26 February 2015 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Karzełek''' (diminutive of ''karzeł'' &amp;ndash; a small one, used for describing non-fantasy [[dwarfism|dwarf]]s) or '''Skarbnik, Kladenets''' (Russian: Скарбник, Кладенец) (the Treasurer) or '''[[Dzedka]]''' (Belarusian: Дзедка) in [[Slavic mythology]] live in mines and underground workings and are the guardians of gems, crystals, and precious metals. It is said that they will protect miners from danger and lead them back when they are lost. They will also lead them to veins of ore. To people who are evil or insult them they are deadly; pushing them into dark chasms or send tunnels crashing down upon them. Hurling rocks, whistling or covering one’s head are actions that are offensive to Skarbnik, who will warn the offender with handfuls of pelted soil in their direction before taking serious action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wielka Księga Demonów Polskich.

As in many other countries with a [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] heritage, '''[[law enforcement]] in [[Benin]]''' is a responsibility primarily shared by a [[gendarmerie]] and a [[police]] force.

==Police==
The '''Police of the Republic of Benin''' ({{lang-fr|Police Republicaine du Bénin}}) is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior, Public Security and Religious Affairs (MISPC, {{lang-fr|Ministère de l’Intérieur, de la Sécurité publique et des Cultes}}).&lt;ref name=interpolbenin&gt;{{cite web|title=Bénin|url=http://www.interpol.int/fr/Pays-membres/Afrique/B%C3%A9nin|website=INTERPOL|publisher=INTERPOL|accessdate=19 June 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is divided into six '''directions départementales'''. Police training is conducted at the national police school in [[Cotonou]].

==Gendarmerie==
The '''Gendarmerie nationale béninoise''' has both military and police roles. Due to its military status, the gendarmerie answers to the Ministry of Defence. It is headquartered in [[Porto-Novo]]. As a police force, it has administrative and judiciary police powers. It operates both in territorial units, responsible for defined areas, and mobile units, which can be dispatched. Overall, it has jurisdiction in nearly 90% of the country's territory.

==Other forces==
In addition to the police and gendarmerie, law enforcement is provided by several forces, including [[customs]] (''les Douanes''), [[game warden]]s (''les Eaux et forêts'') and the ''Unité mixte de contrôle des conteneurs'' (UMCC).

==Joint container inspection unit==
The '''Unité mixte de contrôle des conteneurs'' includes staff from the ''Police'', ''Gendarmerie'', ''Douanes'', and ''Eaux et forêts''. Stationed in the harbour of Cotonou, it inspects [[Shipping container|containers]] in order to prevent the shipping of prohibited items such as drugs, weapons and counterfeit goods.&lt;ref name=interpolbenin /&gt;

The '''Makua''' or '''Makhuwa''' languages are a branch of [[Bantu languages]] spoken primarily in [[Mozambique]].

==Name==
The name ''Makua (Macua)'', more precisely ''Makhuwa'', is used on three levels. Some sources distinguish these with differences in spelling 'Makua' vs. 'Makhuwa', but they are not consistent.
#Central Makhuwa, or "Makhuwa-Makhuwana", the [[prestige dialect]] and the basis of the national language of [[Mozambique]]
#The [[Makhuwa language]], including various dialects which also go by the name ''Makhuwa''; sometimes called 'core' or 'nuclear' Makua, but this is not consistent
#Closely related languages which often have their own names, such as [[Lomwe language|Lomwe]] (also known as Western Makua)

==Classification==
Makhuwa is assigned to Zone P of the [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages]]. With the classification of the other Zone-P languages as [[Rufiji–Ruvuma languages|Rufiji–Ruvuma]], Makhuwa becomes essentially synonymous with Zone P. However, the zones are geographic rather than genealogical clades. The closest relatives of the Makhuwa branch are not clear, but some classifications place them with the [[Nyasa languages|Nyasa]] and [[Southern Bantu languages]].
*[[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]] (Core Makhuwa, including dialects Makhuwa-Meetto, Makhuwa-Shirima, Makhuwa-Marrevone, etc.)
*[[Koti language|Koti]]
*[[Sakati language|Sakati]]
*[[Lomwe language|Lomwe]] (including Ngulu dialect)
*[[Chuwabu language|Chuwabu]]
*[[Moniga language|Moniga]]

The core languages, and beyond, have minimal [[mutual intelligibility]].

The current '''one leu''' banknote is the smallest circulating denomination of the [[Romanian leu]]. It is the same size as the [[Euro banknotes|5 Euro banknote]].

The main color of the current banknote is green. It pictures, on the obverse [[Prime minister of Romania|Prime-minister]] and historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], and on the reverse the [[Curtea de Argeş Cathedral]], which suffered a massive restoration under his Government, and a crossed eagle, the [[Wallachia]]n traditional heraldic element.

== History ==

* banknote issue: 1915 (re-issues: 1920, 1937, 1938), ''1917 (issued by the Romanian General Bank and circulated in the German occupation area between 1917-1918)''
* coin issue: 1924
* banknote re-issue: 1938 (re-issue of the 1915 design)
* coin issue: 1938 (re-issues: 1939, 1940, 1941)

'''Fourth leu - RON (since 2005)'''
* banknote issue: 2005 (redesigned issue of the former 10.000 lei banknote, whereas 10.000 third lei = 1 fourth leu)

The '''Path of the Mani''' is an ancient high-road from [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]], to the [[mountain pass]] of [[Langtang]] between the valleys of Nepal and the dry highlands of the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The pass is characterised by [[cairn]]s and aligned stones and slabs at the sides often with a form of [[mandala]] or inscription on them. The path played an important role in trade between [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]] where beasts of burden such as [[mule]]s, [[yak]]s and [[donkey]]s would carry furs, hides, yak tails, [[borax]], [[salt]], [[musk]] and medicinal herbs for trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Willis, Michael|year=1999|title=Tibet:Life, Myth and Art|publisher=Duncan Baird Publishers Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Langtan a [[mantra]] guards the entrance to Tibet with a holy invocation of [[Avalokiteshvara]].

The '''Salviati Planisphere''' is a [[world map]] showing the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] view of the Earth's surface at the time of its creation {{circa}} 1525, and includes the eastern coasts of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] and the [[Strait of Magellan|Straits of Magellan]]. Rather than include imagined material in unexplored areas—as was customary—it is content to leave them blank, inviting future exploration.

It is believed to have been drawn by [[Nuno Garcia de Toreno]], the head of the [[Casa de Contratación|Casa de la Contratacion]],  in [[Seville]]. It takes its name from Cardinal [[Giovanni Salviati]], the [[Nuncio|papal nuncio]] to Spain from 1525-30, who was given it by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]], also [[King of Spain]] at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Mapping of the Entradas Into the Greater Southwest|last = Reinhartz|first = Dennis (editor)|publisher = University of Oklahoma Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0806130474|location = |pages = 62|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PX-WcAL_RQcC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=salviati+planisphere&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mceBJFrDGS&amp;sig=S70YXogz1RTBCc5Vk3f4lKPO7mM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCWoVChMI4Nqxl7-8yAIVhbQUCh13HAL6#v=onepage&amp;q=salviati%20planisphere&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Padrón2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ricardo Padrón|title=The Spacious Word: Cartography, Literature, and Empire in Early Modern Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxCv8jUEIsAC&amp;pg=PA131|year=2004|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-64433-2|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WolffColin1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hans Wolff|author2=Susi Colin|title=America: early maps of the New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m44OAQAAMAAJ|year=1992|publisher=Prestel|isbn=978-3-7913-1232-3|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Union Makes the Nation''' ({{lang-fr|L'Union fait la Nation}}, abbreviated UN or the Union) is an alliance of opposition political parties in [[Benin]]. It is composed of the [[Democratic Renewal Party (Benin)|PRD]], [[African Movement for Development and Progress|MADEP]], [[Social Democratic Party (Benin)|PSD]], [[Benin Rebirth Party|RB]], [[Key Force]], [[Movement for Development and Solidarity|MDS]], [[National Union for Democracy and Progress (Benin)|UNDP]], MARCHE, [[Party for Democracy and Social Progress|PDPS]] and [[Rally of Liberal Democrats for National Reconstruction|RDL VIVOTEN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lunionfaitlanation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=54&amp;Itemid=99|title=Partis membres|publisher=Union fait la Nation|language=French|accessdate=2011-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore represents an expansion of the [[Alliance for a Democratic Dynamic]] to embrace most of the significant Beninese parties opposed to the government of President [[Yayi Boni]]. The Union contested the [[Beninese presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential]] and [[Beninese parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary elections]]. Their presidential candidate, [[Adrien Houngbédji]], was credited with 35.7% of the vote; he issued a statement rejecting the validity of the election results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lunionfaitlanation.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=69:actualites&amp;id=247:declaration-de-houngbedji-suite-aux-resultats&amp;format=pdf|title=Déclaration de Houngbédji suite aux résultats|accessdate=2011-11-06|date=2011-03-11|author=Adrien Houngbédji|publisher=Union fait la Nation|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the parliamentary elections, the Union took 30 seats out of 83&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telecommunication.ivoire-blog.com/archive/2011/05/13/benin-proclamation-par-la-cour-constitutionnelle-des-resulta.html|title=BENIN: Proclamation par la cour constitutionnelle des résultats définitifs des législatives du 30 avril|accessdate=2011-11-06|date=2011-05-13|language=French|author=Emmanuel Gbeto}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become by far the largest opposition party.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British diplomat, consul at [[Massawa]] on the [[Red Sea]] coast from 1848 to his death. He played a role in [[Ethiopia|Ethiopian]] politics in the mid 19th-century: during his tenure he cultivated the friendship of first ''[[Ras (title)|Ras]]'' [[Ali II of Yejju|Ali]], and later the Ethiopian emperor [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros II]]. 

J. R. Hooker remarks that "as a political agent, Plowden was valuable; as a writer of travel literature he was engaging and intelligent; but as a consul he was useless, his commercial reports being limited to three in 1852. He was never at his post after 1855."&lt;ref&gt;Hooker, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/180000 "The Foreign Office and the 'Abyssinian Captives'", ''Journal of African History''], '''2''' (1961), p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1860, Plowden was murdered during a journey between [[Gondar]] and the [[Red Sea]] by a follower of [[Agew Niguse]], a warlord hostile to Tewodros. Plowden was interred in the [[Royal Enclosure (Gondar)|Royal Enclosure]], next to the Gemjabet Mariyam church. His writings were published as ''Travels in Abyssinia and the Galla Country, with an account of a mission to Ras Ali in 1848'' by his brother in London in 1868.&lt;ref name=travels&gt;{{cite book
