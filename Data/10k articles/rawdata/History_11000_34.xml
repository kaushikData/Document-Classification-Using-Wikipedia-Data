In 1946 the government of [[Canada]] conducted the fifth of a series of special [[census]]es covering the rapidly expanding Northwest Provinces of [[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]], and [[Manitoba]]. These censuses were conducted every ten years from 1906 to 1946. This census was conducted as at June 1, 1946.

The entire population of Canada for 1946 was estimated at 12,292,000, an increase of 1.8% over the previous year.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

Canada's ''[[Statistics Act]]'' legislation does not permit the release of personal information until 92 years have elapsed. Detailed information from this census is not due for release until 2038.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After 1921|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/census/Pages/census.aspx#after_1921|website=Library and Archives Canada|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annazid Rulers==
'''Abul-Fath Mohammad bin Annaz (r. 990–1011)''' was the founder of the Annazid dynasty and ruled in [[Hulwan, Iran|Hulwan]]. Political conflicts during his twenty-year rule led to clashes in the west with the [[Arab]] clans ''Banu Oqayl'' (from whom he temporarily seized ''[[Daquq]]'' in 998) and the ''Banu Mazyad'', as well as a campaign against ''Zahman bin Hendi'', lord of [[Khanaqin]], whose family he destroyed in 999. In the east, there was fierce competition between him and the ''Hasanwayhid'' [[Kurds]] (his relatives through marriage). In 1006, ''Badr bin Hasanuya'' aided by ''Abul-Hassan Ali bin Mazyad'', sent an army of 10,000 men against ''Abul-Fath'', who was compelled to seek refuge with the [[Buyid]] [[vizier]], ''Amid-al-Joyus Abu Ali Hassan bin Abi Jafar'' in [[Baghdad]]. In a treaty concluded that year between the two [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] dynasties, ''Abul-Fath'' declared himself a ''Hasanwayhid'' [[vassal]].

'''Hosam-al-Dawla Abul-Shawk (r. 1011–1046)''' was son of ''Abul-Fath Annaz''. His thirty-six-year rule was filled with internecine strife as well as external conflict. As a result, the extent of his authority grew a great deal, sometimes reaching as far as [[Hilla]] and at other times contracting to a narrow region in present-day western [[Iran]]. He inaugurated his reign by checking an attack by the forces of the new [[Buyid]] vizier, ''Fakhr-al-molk'', but he was compelled to retreat to [[Hulwan, Iran|Hulwan]] until a reconciliation was achieved. In 1029, he managed to defeat ''Shams-al-Dawla'' and stop the [[Seljuk Turks]], after they seized [[Hamadan]] and attacked ''Dinawar'' and ''Asadabad''. In 1029, ''Abul-Shawk'' defeated the ''Oqayl'' and took ''Daquq''. In the period 1038–1039, he seized [[Kermanshah]](''Qarmisin'') and captured its ruler (a Quhid [[Kurd]]). In 1040, his son ''Abul-Fath Abul-Shawk'' tried to capture territories belonging to  ''Mohalhel'' but was defeated and captured. ''Mohalhel'' secured assistance from ''Ala-al-Dawla bin Kakuya'', the ruler of [[Hamadan]], and then he seized ''Dinawar'', [[Kermanshah]], and other regions. 
Relations between ''Abul-Shawk'' and ''Mohalhel'' improved following the intervention of ''Jalal-al-Dawla'', but Mohalhel's refusal to release ''Abul-Fath bin Shawk'' led to renewed hostilities in 1040 and 1042, but he failed to release his son, who died in captivity. During the second campaign in 1042, Mohalhel caused great damage in ''Sanda'' ([[Sanandaj]]).

In 1045, [[Toghrul Beg]] sought to capture Annazid territories. During the campaign, the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] governor of [[Hamadan]] fled, and ''Abul-Shawk'' retreated from Dinawar to Kermanshah and then to the citadel of [[Sirwan, Iran|Sirwan]].
on the [[Diyala River|Diyala]] river, where a large number of Kurds rallied around him. ''Annazids'' where unable to stop the march of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], which captured [[Hulwan, Iran|Hulwan]] and ''Mahidasht'' and attacked [[Khanaqin]]. ''Abul-Shawk'' died in the citadel of Sirwan in April 1046. His followers rallied around Mohalhel.

==Mohalhel==
The strife between the Annazid chiefs continued during Mohalhel regime, especially when Sa'di bin Abul-Shawk sided with Yenal (he was the half-brother of [[Toghrul Beg]]) against his uncle. Yenal seized [[Hulwan, Iran|Hulwan]] in 1046 in the name of Hasanwayhid ''Badr bin Taher bin Helal''. After four years of reconciliation between the Annazids and the [[Seljuk Turks|Seljuk]], Mohalhel met [[Toghrul Beg]] in 1050, who confirmed his rule over [[Sirwan, Iran|Sirwan]], ''Daquq'', ''Sharazor'' and ''Samagan'' and released his brother ''Sokrab''.

==Decline of Annazids==
A declining Annazid rule can be traced for several generations. The last mention occurs in the second half of 12th century, when Surkhab III ibn Annaz became one of the rulers of [[Lorestan]]. According to the Kurdish historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]] and Sharafnama, the Annazid era lasted 130 years.

'''Arthur Le Moyne de La Borderie''', (5 October 1827, [[Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine]] – 17 February 1901, Vitré) was a Breton historian, regarded as a father of Brittany's historiography.

==Life==
He came from ''La Borderie'', which was an estate in the commune of [[Étrelles]].&lt;ref name="REN"&gt;Archives départementales d'Ille-et-Vilaine, Bibliothèque municipale de [[Rennes]], ''Arthur de La Borderie, 1827-1901'', Rennes, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

After studying law, he entered the [[École des Chartes]]. He left it in 1852 and from 1853 to 1859 worked in the archives of [[Loire-Atlantique|Loire-Inférieure]]. He was a founder member of the ''Société archéologique et historique d'[[Ille-et-Vilaine]]'', of which he was president from 1863 to 1890.

Gaining recognition for his innumerable works on the [[history of Brittany]], he enlivened research in many areas and inspired many historians by his influence and example. He was the director of the historic review ''Revue de Bretagne et Vendée'' (published from 1867 to 1900) that he founded aged 25.

He had been elected conseiller général of [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] from 1864 to 1871 then, the same year, député for [[Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine|Vitré]], until 1876. In this role he was reporter of the ''Commission d'enquête sur les actes du gouvernement de la défense nationale'' (Commission of Inquiry into the Acts of the Government of National Defence). In particular he led the investigation into events at [[Camp Conlie]] where 50,000 Breton soldiers were held and supposedly mistreated in 1871. His report was overwhelmingly critical of the French army, which demonstrated a total lack of organization.

In the years after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] he re-formed the ''Association bretonne'' which had been dissolved as suspect by the government of [[Napoléon III]]. A large part of his library is now in the town library of [[Rennes]], while the huge collection of original documents which he amassed is now housed in the departmental archives of Ille-et-Vilaine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7009">'''Ballet d’action''' is a hybrid genre of expressive and symbolic ballet that emerged during the 18th century. Retroactively coined in 1855 by theater critic [[Théophile Gautier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sabee|first=Olivia|date=2016|title=Théophile Gautier's Ballet d'Action: Rewriting Dance History through Criticism|url=|journal=Dance Chronicle|volume=39|pages=153–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of its chief aims was to liberate the conveyance of a story from dialogue, relying simply on quality of movement to communicate actions, motives, and emotions. The expression of dancers was highlighted in many of the influential works as a vital aspect of the ballet d’action. To become an embodiment of emotion or passion through free expression, movement, and realistic choreography was one chief aim of this dance.&lt;ref&gt;Noverre, Jean-Georges. “Letter 1”. ''Letters on Dancing and Ballets''. 1760, rev. 1803. In ''What is Dance? Readings in Theory and Criticism,'' Roger Copeland and Marshall Cohen. Oxford University Press, 1983. Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the mimetic aspect of dance was used to convey what the lack of dialogue could not. Certainly, there may have been codified gestures; however, a main tenant of the ballet d’action was to free dance from unrealistic symbolism, so this remains an elusive question. Often, props and costume object were involved in the performance to help clarify character interaction and passions. An example would be the scarf from ''[[La fille mal gardée|La Fille Mal Gardee]]'', which represents the love of the male character and which the female character accepts after a coy moment. Props were thus used in harmony with dancer movement and expression. Programs for plays were also a place to explain the onstage action; however, overt clarifications were sometimes criticized for sullying the art of the ballet d’action.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nye, Edward. ''Mime, Music and Drama on the Eighteenth-Century Stage: The Ballet d'Action'', Cambridge University Press, 2011. Cambridge, UK, pp. 1–6, 140–154, 170–177, 229–232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[French people|French]] [[Choreography|choreographer]] [[Jean-Georges Noverre]] is often credited with the original ideas and definitions of what he termed “ballet en action”, there were various other influences that contributed to the development of the genre. While Noverre’s 'Letter 1' provides a clear outline of his ideas of ballet d’action, he was not the first nor the last to develop a theory of a ballet in action.

== Influencers ==
* In the early 1700s, the [[grotesque]] genre of dancing was influential in that it inspired two very different outcomes: Gennaro Magri's style of rigid, mechanized dancing and body position, and [[John Weaver (dancer)|'''John Weaver''']]’s idea of passion and expression in dance. In his “Essay Towards a History of Modern Dancing”, Weaver writes that “modern dancing” (or the grotesque character) should include the mimetic qualities in harmony with choreography and movement. He encourages the idea that an audience should be able to recognize the emotions of a character and the story-line of a dance simply through the expression and movements of the dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, John. “Essay Towards a History of Dancing”. Shakespeare’s Head, 1712. London, Britain, pp. 157–169.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Marie Sallé|'''Marie Salle''']] was not only a major influence on the development of ballet d’action, but an exemplary dancer, choreographer, and teacher in her own right. Her background as a carnival performer most likely contributed to her fame as a skilled mime. An evolution from the grotesque dance into the pantomime ballet created the stores by action that so inspired Noverre. As her student, he was exposed to her modern, expressive dancing and the conveyance of passions onstage. She danced with costume innovations that are clearly the parent of the ballet d’action; instead of heavy, cumbersome costumes and masks, she performed in simple outfits with her hair and face free to the audience. Her dance partners, too, were affected by her expressive dances, as written by none other than Noverre. Her free and passionate mimetic theatrical dances clearly inspired, at least in part, Noverre’s treatise. One could say that they were the first instances of the ‘classic’ ballet d’action.&lt;ref&gt;McCleave, Sarah. “Marie Sallé, a Wise Professional Woman of Influence”. ''Women's Work: Making Dance in Europe before 1800,'' edited by Lynn Matluck Brooks, University of Wisconsin Press, 2007. Madison, Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In 1760 '''[[Jean-Georges Noverre]]''' wrote ''Letters on Dancing and Ballets'', a widely published and highly popular dance manual. Dissatisfied with the outdated ideals of ballet, Noverre called for severe reforms to the art form. These reforms presented the concept of dance drama, or ''ballet  en action''. Noverre's manifesto explored the following:
** Logical plots: No more illogical or insane plots. Ballets should be rationally constructed. Stage action should be coherent, with each scene consistent in tone. Variety and contrast can be displayed throughout the ballet as a whole.
** Truth over nature: Noverre did away with the symbolism and abstractions present in the court ballet. Mythological figures could only be used in ballets if motivated by human emotions.
** No to the use of masks: Noverre did away with the use of masks. The dancer's face should be seen. It is expressive and reinforces the emotion they are trying to communicate with their audience.
** Costume Reform: Dancers should be dressed in light fabrics that show off their figures and allow for mobility. No more cumbersome costumes such as panniers or tonnelets. Costumes should be timely and represent the character the dancer is portraying.
** Artistic Collaboration: Noverre called for better communication between artistic collaborators. It had been common practice (until this point) for the choreographer, composer, the designers, and the machinists to work independently until late in the production process. Noverre felt that a more cohesive creative process was integral to the success of a ballet.
** Noverre was also a proponent of education. He recommended that choreographers educate themselves in additional subjects to better assist in their ability to create truthful ballets. For example, a choreographer should study painting so he can compose stage pictures (formations) as a painter would. He should also observe people in all walks of life, so he can apply realistic and appropriate gestures to the characters created in ballets.
* Other contributors include the choreographers Jean-Baptiste de Hesse (1705–1779) and Franz Anton Hilverding (1710–1768), as well as critic [[Gasparo Angiolini]] (1731–1803) and [[Louis de Cahusac]] (1700–1759), a French librettist and dance historian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9129">[[File:Bisamweste.jpg|thumb|A mannequin with a coonskin cap]]
A '''coonskin cap''' is a [[hat]] fashioned from the skin and [[fur]] of a [[raccoon]]. The original coonskin cap consisted of the entire skin of the raccoon including its head and tail. Beginning as traditional Native American headgear, coonskin caps became associated with American and Canadian [[frontiersmen]] of the 18th and 19th centuries, and were highly popular among boys in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="OCWeekly"&gt;{{cite news|last=Change|first=Vickie|title=Coonskin Hats: Fur Real?|newspaper =OC Weekly|date =15 April 2010|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-04-15/culture/trendzilla-coonskin-hats/full/|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Coonskin caps were originally a traditional [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] article of clothing.&lt;ref name="OCWeekly"/&gt; When Europeans began colonizing the [[Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky]] areas, the colonists started wearing them as [[hunting]] caps.

The coonskin cap eventually became a part of the [[iconic|iconic image]] associated with American [[frontiersmen]] such as [[Daniel Boone]] and [[Davy Crockett]]. Boone did not actually wear coonskin caps, which he disliked, and instead wore [[felt hats]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Truman|first=Cheryl|title=Dan’l Unadorned: Author Knocks Coonskin Cap off a Legend | newspaper =Lexington Herald-Leader|date=24 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[explorer]] [[Meriwether Lewis]] wore a coonskin cap during the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. [[Joseph L. Meek]] wore the coonskin cap in the mountains.

An account of actor Noah Ludlow introducing the popular song "[[The Hunters of Kentucky]]" while wearing a coonskin cap is shown to be spurious in Ludlow's [[autobiography]].  Ludlow recounted that initial performance of 1822: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;As soon as the comedy of the night was over, I dressed myself in a [[Buckskin (leather)|buckskin]] hunting-shirt and leggins, which I borrowed off a river man, and with [[moccasin (footwear)|moccasin]]s on my feet and an old slouched hat on my head, and a [[rifle]] on my shoulder, I presented myself before the audience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==20th century popularity==
===Estes Kefauver===
Politician [[Estes Kefauver]] of Tennessee adopted the coonskin cap as a personal [[trademark]] during his successful 1948 [[political campaign|campaign]] for election to the [[United States Senate]]. Tennessee [[political boss]] [[E. H. Crump]] had published advertisements accusing Kefauver of being a raccoon-like [[Communist]] puppet. In response, Kefauver put on a coonskin cap during a speech in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], proclaiming: "I may be a [[pet]] coon, but I'm not Boss Crump's pet coon."&lt;ref name=TNencEK&gt;Theodore Brown, Jr., [http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entry.php?rec=733 Carey Estes Kefauver, 1903-1963], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to use the coonskin cap as a trademark throughout his political career, which included unsuccessful campaigns for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nomination in 1952 and 1956, an unsuccessful campaign for the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidency]] as [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]'s running mate in 1956, and successful Senatorial re-election campaigns in 1954 and 1960.&lt;ref name=TNencEK/&gt;

===1950s fad===
In the 20th century, the iconic association was in large part due to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s television program ''[[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]]'' and the first three [[Davy Crockett (TV miniseries)|"Davy Crockett"]] episodes starring [[Fess Parker]], which aired from December 1954 to February 1955. In the episodes, which once again made Crockett into one of the most popular men in the country, the frontier hero was portrayed wearing a coonskin cap. The show spawned several ''Disneyland'' Davy Crockett sequels as well as other similar shows and movies, with many of them featuring Parker as the lead actor. Parker went on to star in a ''[[Daniel Boone (1964 TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' television series (1964-1970), again wearing a coonskin cap. 

Crockett's new popularity initiated a [[fad]] among boys all over the United States as well as a [[The Ballad of Davy Crockett|Davy Crockett craze]] in the United Kingdom. The look of the cap that was marketed to young boys was typically simplified; it was usually a [[faux fur]] lined skull cap with a raccoon tail attached. A variation was marketed to young girls as the Polly Crockett hat. It was similar in style to the boys' cap, including the long tail, but was made of all-white fur (faux or possibly rabbit). At the peak of the fad, coonskin caps sold at a rate of 5,000 caps a day.&lt;ref&gt;John Johnson, [http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/23/local/me-fess23 Coonskin Cap Clings to ‘Crockett’], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 23, 2002, page A-1&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1950s, Crockett's popularity waned and the fad slowly died out. The fad is recalled by numerous cultural references, such as the wearing of coonskin caps as part of [[The Junior Woodchucks]] uniform in Disney's [[Donald Duck comics]]. Novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]] referenced both the hat and the fashion in his novel [[V.]], where he refers to the hat as a "bushy Freudian [[hermaphrodite]] symbol".

===Other uses===
Coonskin caps are powerful cultural symbols that continued to be seen in [[film]], [[television]], and other contexts in the latter decades of the 20th century.

* In the 1964 ABC-TV series ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'', [[Uncle Fester]] occasionally wore a coonskin cap dyed black with a white strip running down the middle of both the crown and the tail, suggesting that it was made from the skin of a [[skunk]].
* The 1983 film ''[[A Christmas Story]]'', which features various cultural artifacts of American childhood from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, depicts a boy wearing a coonskin cap.
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' depicts [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Jebediah Springfield|Jebediah Springfield]], the early 19th-century founder of the fictional [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|town of Springfield]], in a coonskin cap.
* [[Florida]] politician [[Lawton Chiles]] put on a coonskin cap while celebrating his 1994 [[Governor of Florida|gubernatorial]] re-election victory over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Jeb Bush]], recalling a campaign statement in which Chiles had predicted victory by saying "the old he-coon walks just before the light of day."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/State/121398/Chiles_leaves_footpri.html Chiles leaves footprints in many parts of Florida], ''St. Petersburg Times'', December 13, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Great Brain]]'' series features Parley Benson, a person who wears a coonskin cap.
* In [[Walt Disney]]'s stories, the [[Junior Woodchucks]] [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]] also wear coonskin caps.
* In the American History cartoon ''Histeria!'', Kip Ling, the bow-haired girl, Froggo and Aka Pelly are seen wearing coonskin caps when they sing a song about Philo Farnsworth. Toast has been seen wearing one on a bus with the Kid Chorus.
* Ferb from the American cartoon ''Phineas and Ferb'' is seen wearing a coonskin cap when he saws a log with Phineas (episode:She's the Mayor)
* Senator Jack S. Phogbound of ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' comic strip wears a coonskin cap
* Sam Shakusky. a lead character of [[Wes Anderson]]'s 2012 film ''[[Moonrise Kingdom]]'', is frequently seen wearing a coonskin cap. The film is set in 1965 and incorporates many elements of 1950s and 1960s youth culture.
* In the acclaimed Disney channel cartoon ''[[Gravity Falls]]'', various characters can be seen wearing coonskin caps in the series, most notably Pacifica Northwest in the episode "Irrational Treasure".
* The Volunteer, one of the costumed mascots for the sports teams of the [[University of Tennessee]], wears a coonskin cap and fringed [[buckskins]], inspired by the frontier attire of many of Tennessee's volunteers in the [[War of 1812]], the inspiration for the state and university's [[List of U.S. state and territory nicknames|nickname]].

'''Demilitarisation''' or '''demilitarization''' may mean the reduction of state armed forces. For instance, the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland entailed the reduction of British security and military apparatuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of Loyalism in Northern Ireland|last=Spencer|first=Graham|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2008|isbn=9781349542246|location=New York|pages=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Demilitarisation in this sense is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. The principle is distinguished from [[demobilization]], which refers to the drastic voluntary reduction in the size of a victorious army. 

== Definitions ==
Demilitarisation was a policy in a number of countries after both world wars. In the [[aftermath of World War I]], the [[United Kingdom]] greatly reduced its military strength, which is also referred to as [[disarmament]]. The resulting position of British military weakness during the rise of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in Germany was among the causes that led to the policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lloyd George and the Appeasement of Germany, 1919-1945|last=Rudman|first=Stella|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781443826570|location=Newcastle upon Tyne|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conversion of a military or paramilitary force into a civilian one is also called demilitarisation. For example, the Italian [[Polizia di Stato]] demilitarised in 1981, and the [[Austrian Gendarmerie]] merged with the national police, making up a new civilian body. Demilitarisation can also refer to the policies employed by Allied forces during the [[occupation of Japan]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|Germany]] after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Haller"&gt;Haller, Oliver, ''[http://archiv.ub.uni-marburg.de/diss/z2007/0126/pdf/doh.pdf Destroying Weapons of Coal, Air and Water: A Critical Evaluation of the American Policy of German Industrial Demilitarization 1945 - 1952]'' (Philipps-Universität Marburg: Marburg, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face the new [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] threat that had become evident as World War 2 ended, and the [[Cold War]] began.

Demilitarisation can also refer to the reduction of one or more types of weapons or weapons systems ''(See [[Arms Control]])'' or the removal of combat equipment from a [[warship]] ''(See [[Japanese battleship Hiei]])''.

A [[demilitarised zone]] is a specific area, such as a buffer zone between nations previously engaged in armed conflict, where military persons, equipment or activities are forbidden. This can also include areas designated during conflicts in which nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. The demilitarised zone is also free from all activities that assist the war efforts of any of the belligerents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to International Humanitarian Law|last=Djukić|first=Dražan|last2=Pons|first2=Niccolò|publisher=BRILL Nijhoff|year=2018|isbn=9789004342002|location=Leiden|pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, this zone is protected from attack and many countries forbid their troops from targeting because it would constitute a grave breach or a serious war crime that would likely warrant the institution of criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Customary International Humanitarian Law|last=Henckaerts|first=Jean-Marie|last2=Doswald-Beck|first2=Louise|last3=Alvermann|first3=Carolin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=9780521839372|location=Cambridge|pages=691}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, however, of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|Korean Demilitarised Zone]], of the areas beyond the demilitarized strip that separates both sides, are heavily militarized.

Examples of demilitarisation include:

* The [[Treaty of Versailles]] barred post–World War I Germany from having an air force, armoured vehicles, and certain types of naval vessels. In addition, it established a demilitarised zone in the [[Rhineland]].
* The massive reductions of military personnel in the Allied countries, following World War I.
** The [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after World War II]]
* The [[Washington Naval Treaty]]
* The [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]

"'''From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs'''" is a [[slogan]] popularised by [[Karl Marx]] in his 1875 ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''.&lt;ref name="CGP P1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marx |first=Karl |title=Critique of the Gotha Program |year=1875 |accessdate=2008-07-15 |chapter=Part I |chapterurl=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm|title-link=Critique of the Gotha Program }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle refers to free access and distribution of goods, capital and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Busky|first= Donald F.|title= Democratic Socialism: A Global Survey|publisher= Praeger|date=July 20, 2000|isbn= 978-0275968861|page = 4|quote=Communism would mean free distribution of goods and services.

==Origin of the phrase==

The complete paragraph containing Marx's statement of the creed in the ''Critique of the Gotha Program'' is as follows:
{{quote frame|In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly—only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners:'' From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!&lt;ref name="CGP P1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WA"/&gt;}}

Although Marx is popularly thought of as the originator of the phrase, the slogan was common within the socialist movement. For example, it was used by [[August Becker (socialist)|August Becker]] in 1844&lt;ref&gt;''Was wollen die Kommunisten'', 1844, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FUg9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=&amp;#x22;Jeder+nach+seinen+Fähigkeiten,+jedem+nach+seinen+Bedürfnissen!&amp;#x22;&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi126Ps1ObPAhXLLo8KHcJ2D80Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;#x22;Jeder&amp;#x20;nach&amp;#x20;seinen&amp;#x20;Fähigkeiten%2C&amp;#x20;jedem&amp;#x20;nach&amp;#x20;seinen&amp;#x20;Bedürfnissen!&amp;#x22; p. 34].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Louis Blanc]] in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Blanc, ''Plus de Girondins'', 1851, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KFc9AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA92#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 92].&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this phrasing has also been attributed to the French utopian [[Étienne-Gabriel Morelly]],&lt;ref name="graeber"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Democracy Project: A History, a Crisis, a Movement|last=Graeber|first=David|publisher=[[Spiegel &amp; Grau]]|year=2013|isbn=9780812993561|location=New York|pages=293–294|oclc=810859541|authorlink=David Graeber|title-link=The Democracy Project: A History, a Crisis, a Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E. Bowie, ''Towards a new theory of distributive justice'' (1971), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed in his 1755 ''Code of Nature'' "Sacred and Fundamental Laws that would tear out the roots of vice and of all the evils of a society", including:&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Titelman, ''Random House dictionary of popular proverbs &amp; sayings'' (1996), p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote frame|I. Nothing in society will belong to anyone, either as a personal possession or as capital goods, except the things for which the person has immediate use, for either his needs, his pleasures, or his daily work.&lt;br/&gt;II. Every citizen will be a public man, sustained by, supported by, and occupied at the public expense.&lt;br/&gt;III. Every citizen will make his particular contribution to the activities of the community according to his capacity, his talent and his age; it is on this basis that his duties will be determined, in conformity with the distributive laws.}}

A similar phrase can be found in the [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]] Covenant in 1639:
{{quote frame|We whose names are here underwritten, intending by God's gracious permission to plant ourselves in New England, and if it may be, in the southerly part about Quinnipiack, do faithfully promise each, for ourselves and our families and those that belong to us, that we will, the Lord assisting us, sit down and join ourselves together in one entire plantation, and be helpful each to the other in any common work, '''according to every man's ability, and as need shall require,''' and we promise not to desert or leave each other or the plantation, but with the consent of the rest, or the greater part of the company who have entered into this engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bushnellhomestead.org/covenant.html The Guilford Covenant]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars trace the origin of the phrase to the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Arthur Baird, ''The Greed Syndrome: An Ethical Sickness in American Capitalism'' (1989), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Berman]], ''Adventures in Marxism'' (2000), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Acts of the Apostles]] the lifestyle of the community of believers in Jerusalem is described as communal (without individual possession), and uses the phrase "''distribution was made unto every man according as he had need''" ({{lang|grc|διεδίδετο δὲ ἑκάστῳ καθότι ἄν τις χρείαν εἶχεν}}):
{{quote frame|Acts 4:32–35: 32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common. 33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all. 34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 35 And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.}}

However, other scholars disagree with this, and claim that the phrase 'from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs' has a non-religious origin, in 'the Roman legal concept of obligation in solidum' &lt;ref&gt; James Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill 2018, p. 113. &lt;/ref&gt; The Roman legal concept of obligation in solidum is that 'everyone assumes responsibility for anyone who cannot pay his debt, and he is conversely responsible for everyone else'. &lt;ref&gt; Hauke Brunkhorst, Solidarity: From Civic Friendship to a Global Legal Community, MIT Press 2005, p. 2 &lt;/ref&gt; James Furner then argues:

'If x = a disadvantage, and y = action to redress that disadvantage, the principle of solidarity is: if any member of a group acquires x, each member has a duty to perform y (if they can assist). All we then need to add, to get to the fundamental principle of developed communism, is to assume that non-satisfaction of a need is a disadvantage. The corresponding principle of solidarity in respect of need says: if any member of society has an unsatisfied need, each member has a duty to produce its object (if they can). But that is precisely what the principle ‘from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs!’ dictates. In Marx’s vision, the basic principle of developed communism is a principle of solidarity in respect of need.' &lt;ref&gt; James Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill 2018, p. 113 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates on the idea==

Marx delineated the specific conditions under which such a creed would be applicable—a society where technology and social organization had substantially eliminated the need for physical labor in the production of things, where "labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm Part 1], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Critique of the Gotha Programme], http://www.marxists.org, quoting Marx/Engels Selected Works, Volume Three, p. 13-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx explained his belief that, in such a society, each person would be motivated to work for the good of society despite the absence of a social mechanism ''compelling''  them to work, because work would have become a pleasurable and creative activity. Marx intended the initial part of his slogan, "from each according to his ability" to suggest not merely that each person should work as hard as they can, but that each person should best develop their particular talents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bli︠a︡khman |first1=Leonid Solomonovich |last2=Shkaratan |first2=Ovseĭ Irmovich |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tu_TAAAAMAAJ&amp;q |title=Man at Work: The Scientific and Technological Revolution, the Soviet Working Class and Intelligentsia |publisher=Progress |year=1977 |page=155 |accessdate=2014-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first1=Hewlett |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xh9YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q |title=Searching for light: an autobiography |publisher=Joseph |year=1968 |accessdate=2014-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Claiming themselves to be at a "lower stage of communism" (i.e. "socialism", in line with Marx's terminology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ken Post|author2=Phil Wright|title=Socialism and underdevelopment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Od8NAAAAQAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-01628-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Od8NAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Soviet Union]] adapted the formula as: "From each according to his ability, [[to each according to his contribution|to each according to his work]] (labour investment)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Jukes|title=The Soviet Union in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqXgTC4XgSEC|year=1973|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02393-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqXgTC4XgSEC&amp;pg=PA225 225]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[liberation theology]] has sought to interpret the Christian call for justice in a way that is in harmony with this Marxist dictum, many have noted that Jesus' teaching in the ''[[Parable of the talents or minas|Parable of the Talents]]'' ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 25:14–30) affirms only "TO each according to his ability" (Matt. 25:15), and not "FROM each according to his ability".&lt;ref name=Finley&gt;{{cite web |last=Finley |first=Tom|title= The Parable of the Talents and the Parable of the Minas (Matt. 25:14-30 and Lk. 19:11-27)|url=http://www.seekersofchrist.org/TALENTS/talents.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018|reason=Points to a paper on a random religious web site; no information about where this was originally published}}

'''[[Globalization]]''' allowed interaction between countries and the global market and has grown economies to higher levels. It is a highly debated subject and there is a great deal to be discussed about it. One perspective on this worldwide movement is the Christian (religious) point of view. First of all, Christians believe in a higher authority, and aim to model their lives in obedience to their God. That being said, they value community and ultimately care for all the people their God has created. That is on a global scale, not only local. They feel a responsibility to the poor, and encourage globalization as it provides more opportunities for countries with weak economies that struggle with poverty. Work is valuable and there is importance in working in a global economy.

There are three main approaches to this topic from this perspective. There is the Evangelical Approach, Catholic Social teaching, and the Non-Evangelical Perspective.

==Evangelical approach==
The evangelical approach focuses on the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ through globalization. Globalization opens many doors to many countries, and this perspective looks at that as an opportunity. It is an opportunity to spread the Christian teaching through the doors that have been opened. In this context globalization is seen as a tool, a stepping stone towards achieving the evangelical goal.

==Catholic social teaching==
The Catholic social teaching looks at globalization with the aim of improving it. Improving it in the sense that they desire to shift the focus to a more humanitarian goal. Thomas Friedman wrote that, "the more I observed the system of globalization at work, the more obvious it was that it had unleashed forest-crushing forces of development and Disney-round-the-clock homogenization which, if left unchecked, had the potential to destroy the environment and uproot cultures at a pace never before seen in human history." in his book ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree'' In this perspective, globalization is not viewed as a positive development, but can be seen as a way to reach more people and create a more socially conscious global environment.

==Non-evangelical perspective==
The non-evangelical perspective highlights the benefits of globalisation through reach. It emphasizes the number of people now more easily contacted and the cultures more easily understood. In this view the focus is not the spread of the gospel but the connecting of the "body of Christ" on a global level. It is basically the universal church being more easily unified through the barriers broken down by globalization.

Amongst his works are ''Sosialismin tulo Suomeen'' (1961), which is about the coming of [[socialism]] to Finland, ''Kunnallinen itsehallinto kansanvallan perusteena'' (1966), about the [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]]s, ''Kansalaissota dokumentteina'' (1967–69), a selection of sources to the [[Finnish civil war]] 1918, ''Luovutetun Karjalan työväenliikkeen historia'' (1970), about the [[Karelia]]n working class movement and ''Kohti kansanvaltaa 1-3'' (1975–91), which treats the social democratic party's history up to 1952. He has also published local historical works such as ''[[Varkaus|Varkauden]] historia'' (1963) and ''[[Sulkava]]n historia II'' (2002, with Paavo Seppänen).

'''Helicopter hieroglyphs''' refer to an [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] carving from the [[Abydos, Egypt#Temple of Seti I|Temple of Seti I]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].

The "helicopter" image is the result of carved stone being re-used over time.  The initial carving was made during the reign of [[Seti I]] and translates to "He who repulses the nine [enemies of Egypt]".  This carving was later filled in with plaster and re-carved during the reign of [[Ramesses II]] with the title "He who protects Egypt and overthrows the foreign countries".  Over time, the plaster has eroded away, leaving both inscriptions partially visible and creating a [[palimpsest]]-like effect of overlapping hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finart.be/UfocomHq/usabydos.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050728103638/http://www.finart.be/UfocomHq/usabydos.htm|title=The Abydos temple "helicopter"|archivedate=28 July 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raincool.blogspot.nl/2010/05/helicopter-hieroglyphs-explained.html|title=Helicopter Hieroglyphs Explained|work=raincool.blogspot.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This claim is dismissed by [[Egyptology|Egyptologists]] who highlight this [[pareidolia]] is partly based on widely distributed [[retouched]] images that removed key details from the actual carvings.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

{{History of Ecuador}}
This article is about the '''history of Ecuador ''' from 1990 to the present.

==Ballén presidency==
In 1992, [[Sixto Durán Ballén]] won his third run for the presidency. His tough [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] adjustment measures were unpopular, but he succeeded in pushing a limited number of modernization initiatives through Congress. Durán Ballén's vice president, [[Alberto Dahik]], was the architect of the administration's economic policies, but in 1995, Dahik fled the country to avoid prosecution on [[political corruption|corruption]] charges following a heated political battle with the opposition. A war with Peru (named [[Cenepa War|the Cenepa War]], after a river located in the area) erupted in January–February 1995 in a small, remote region, where the boundary prescribed by the 1942 [[Rio Protocol]] was in dispute. The Durán-Ballén Administration can be credited with beginning the negotiations that would end in a final settlement of the territorial dispute.

==Bucaram presidency==
In 1996, [[Abdalá Bucaram]], from the populist [[Ecuadorian Roldosist Party|Ecuadorian Roldosista Party]], won the presidency on a platform that promised populist economic and social reforms. Almost from the start, Bucaram's administration languished amidst widespread allegations of corruption. Empowered by the president's unpopularity with organized labor, business, and professional organizations alike, Congress unseated Bucaram in February 1997 on grounds of mental incompetence. The Congress replaced Bucaram with Interim President [[Fabián Alarcón]].

==Constitutional reform==
In May 1997, following the demonstrations that led to the ousting of Bucaram and appointment of Alarcón, the people of Ecuador called for a National Assembly to reform the Constitution and the country's political structure. After a little more than a year, the National Assembly produced a new Constitution.

Congressional and first-round presidential elections were held on May 31, 1998. No presidential candidate obtained a majority, so a run-off election between the top two candidates - Quito Mayor [[Jamil Mahuad]] of the DP and the Right Wing [[Álvaro Noboa]] - was held on July 12, 1998. Mahuad won by a narrow margin. He took office on August 10, 1998. On the same day, Ecuador's new constitution came into effect.

==Mahuad's presidency==
Mahuad concluded a well-received peace with [[Peru]] on October 26, 1998, but increasing economic, fiscal, and financial difficulties drove his popularity steadily lower. However, the coup de grace for Mahuad's administration was Mahuad's decision to make the local currency, the [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucre]] (named after [[Antonio José de Sucre]]), obsolete and replace it with the [[U.S. dollar]] (a policy called [[dollarization]]). This caused massive unrest as the lower classes struggled to convert their now useless sucres to U.S. dollars and lost wealth, while the upper classes (whose members already had their wealth invested in U.S. dollars) gained wealth in turn. Under Mahuad's recession-plagued term, the economy shrank significantly and inflation reached levels of up to 60 percent.

The Republic of '''[[Kabardino-Balkaria]]''' is a [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (a [[Republics of Russia|republic]]), located in the [[Caucasus]] region.

==Early history==
As with other parts of the Caucasus, the area that is now known as Kabardino-Balkaria has been inhabited for thousands of years. The origins of its inhabitants are somewhat obscure.

It is known that proto-[[Kabardians]] called [[Kassogs]] were inhabiting that area already in the 9th century, as the [[Arab]] traveler [[Al Masudi]] speaks of them. 
[[Balkars]] were part of [[Alania]] and one of the [[Vainakh]] tribes, who were influenced by Turkic culture after the [[Mongol]] invasion's split of the lowlands of [[Nakh]] tribes and adopted the language. Also genetically they are closely related to [[Chechens]] and [[Ingush people|Ingush]].&lt;ref&gt;http://genofond.binec.ru/default2.aspx?s=0&amp;p=239&lt;/ref&gt;

The region came under the control of the [[Mongols]] between 1242-1295. It passed into the hands of the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]ns from 1295 to 1505 before falling, briefly, into the orbit of the [[Persian Empire]] between 1502-1516. It was then ruled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1516-1557. From 1557, it became a protectorate of the expanding Russian state &amp;ndash; first [[Muscovy]], then the [[Russian Empire]]. See [[Kabardia]].

==Russian and Soviet rule==
Kabardia gained independence briefly between 1739–1774, before being annexed by Russia under the terms of the [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]]. Balkaria was annexed in 1827. The Russians established a number of forts in the region, notably at [[Nalchik]] (the republic's present-day capital), to secure their control over it. A significant number of Russians &amp;ndash; many of [[Cossack]] descent &amp;ndash; also settled there.

During the [[Russian Civil War]], the region became part of the anti-communist South-Eastern League (1917–1918), then joined the Mountain Peoples’ Autonomous Republic in 1921. On September 1, 1921, with the emergence of the [[Soviet Union]], the territories were organized into the [[Kabardin Autonomous Oblast]]. The region's name was changed to the [[Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Oblast]] the following year, and on December 5, 1936 it was elevated in status and named [[Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]].

In 1944, Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] falsely accused the Balkars of collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and deported the entire population. Their name was deleted from the territory, which was renamed the [[Kabardin ASSR]]. The Balkar population was only allowed to return in 1957 at which point its pre-war name was restored.

==Post-Soviet history==
[[File:Kabardino Balkaria Republic map.png|thumb|250px|Modern Kabardino-Balkaria]]
Kabardino-Balkaria became a full republic in 1991 and in March 1992 became one of the constituent republics of the [[Russian Federation]].

The republic's economy was very hard hit by the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and the outbreak of war in neighboring [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and nearby [[Chechnya]]. The instability produced by the conflicts led to a collapse in tourism in the region and produced an unemployment level estimated to be as high as 90%. The republic's mainly Muslim population has become increasingly radicalised by the region's instability. In October 2005, Kabardino-Balkaria's capital Nalchik was the site of fighting after an [[October 2005 Nalchik attack|attack on the city]] by Chechen militants.

The '''history of the Székely people''' (a subgroup of the [[Hungarians]] in [[Romania]]) can be documented from the 12th century. According to medieval chronicles, the [[Székelys]] were descended from the [[Huns]] who settled in the [[Carpathian Basin]] in the 5th century. This theory was refuted by modern scholars, but no consensual view about the origin of the Székelys exists. They fought in the vanguard of the Hungarian army, implying that they had been a separate ethnic group, but their tongue does not show any trace of a [[language shift]].

Scattered communities of light-armored Székely warriors lived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], especially along the western frontier till the 14th century. Their migration to [[Transylvania]] began in the 11th or 12th century. They first settled in southern Transylvania, but they moved to present-day [[Székely Land]] after the arrival of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] in the late 12th century. They were subjected to a royal official, the [[Count of the Székelys]], from the 1220s. Their military role enabled them to preserve their privileged status. They did not pay tax and the [[King of Hungary|kings of Hungary]] could not grant landed property in Székely Land. Their basic administrative units, known as [[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|seats]] from the 14th century, were headed by elected lieutenants and seat judges. They formed one of the "[[Three Nations of Transylvania]]" after a "brotherly union" was formed by the noblemen, Székelys and Saxons against the rebellious Transylvanian peasants in 1437.

The existence of three groups within the Székely society became evident in the 15th century. The commoners (or ''pixidarii'') held small parcels of land and fought as foot soldiers. The wealthier ''primipili'' were mounted warriors. The high-ranking ''[[Primor|primores]]'', who often also owned estates outside Székely Land, began to expand their authority over the commoners. Royal judges, appointed by the counts of the Székelys, supervised the elected officials of the seats from the 1460s. Being unable to serve in the army, the commoners lost their tax exemption in the 1550s. Many of them were reduced to serfdom after their rebellion was suppressed in 1562. The position of the royal judges was also strengthened, limiting the autonomy of the seats. On the other hand, the liberties of the Székely towns were confirmed. Although most Székelys remained Roman Catholic, significant groups adhered to [[Calvinism]], [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarianism]] or [[Szekler Sabbatarians|Sabbatarianism]] in the 16th century. The Székelys' privileges were restored in the 17th century, but many commoners (who did not want to serve in the army) voluntarily entered into serfdom. After Transylvania became part of the [[Habsburg Empire]] in the 1690s, the central government made attempts to limit the Székelys' liberties. Hundreds of villages were integrated into the [[Military Frontier]] after the ''[[Siculicidium]]'' (or Massacre of Székelys) at [[Madéfalva]] in 1764, but thousands of Székelys migrated to [[Moldavia]] to avoid military service. The Székely border guards lived under strict military rules.

Medieval chronicles unanimously stated that the Székelys were descended from the 5th-century [[Huns]].{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=178}} The ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'' and [[Simon of Kéza]] were the first to mention this information.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=23}} The Székelys' own tradition of their Hunnic origin is well-documented, but it is impossible to decide whether it is a genuine part of their folklore or an adoption of the medieval chroniclers' invention.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} Most modern historians refute the Székelys' association with the Huns.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=10-11}}

[[Bálint Hóman]] was the first to propose that the Székelys were a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] group that joined the Magyars in the [[Pontic steppes]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=11}} [[György Györffy]] likewise said, the Székelys were obviously a separate ethnic group, because they fought in the [[vanguard]] of the Hungarian army.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=11}} Györffy and [[Gyula Kristó]] associated the Székelys with the [[Esegel|Eskils]] (a tribe in [[Volga Bulgaria]] in the 9th century).{{sfn|Kristó|1996|pp=10-11}} Kristó proposed that the Eskils was one of the three tribes of the [[Kabars]] who joined the Magyars after their secession from the [[Khazar Empire]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996|pp=33-34, 137}} Gyula Németh and other linguists refuted the two peoples' identification, stating that their ethnonyms are not connected.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=12}}

According to most linguists and several historians, the Székelys did not [[language shift|change their language]], because they speak the [[Hungarian language]] "without any trace of a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[Stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]]".{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=116}}{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=13}} Linguist Lóránd Benkő asserted that the Székely dialects are closely connected to [[Hungarian dialects]] spoken along the borders of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1301)|medieval Kingdom of Hungary]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=12}} Consequently, he proposed that the Székelys were descended from the military guardians of the frontiers.{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} Their military role secured their special privileges, contributing to the development of their own consciousness.{{sfn|Sedlar|1994|p=406}}{{sfn|Hermann|2004|p=1}} [[Gyula László]] and [[Pál Engel]] proposed that the Székelys were descended from the (supposedly Hungarian-speaking) "[[Late Avar]]" (or [[Onogurs|Onogur]]) population of the Carpathian Basin.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=12-13}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=116}} The theory of the "double conquest" of the Carpathian Basin by the Hungarians has never been widely accepted.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=13}}

Royal charters indicate that scattered Székely groups lived in many regions of the Kingdom of Hungary.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=66}} A charter mentioned a military unit called ''Sceculzaz centurionatus'' ("Székelyszáz hundred") in [[Bihar County]] in 1217.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=130}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=161}} A 1256 diploma referred to a forest at [[Boleráz]] in [[Pozsony County]] (now in [[Slovakia]]) which was located "towards the Székelys".{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=66}} The Székely warriors of [[Nagyváty]] in [[Baranya County (former)|Baranya County]] were mentioned in 1272.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=66}} A 1314 royal charter stated that long time before Székelys had lived in an estate in [[Sopron County]].{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=66}} The Székelys of Sásvár in [[Ugocsa County]] (present-day Trosnik in Ukraine) were mentioned in 1323.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=66}}

The three main dialects of their tongue indicate that the Székelys' ancestors lived along the western frontiers.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=128}} The Székelys who now live along the rivers [[Nyárád (River)|Nyárád]] and [[Târnava Mică River|Kis-Küküllő]] (Niraj and Târnava Mică, respectively in Romania) speak a dialect similar to the tongue of the Hungarian communities near [[Pressburg]] (now Bratislava in Slovakia).{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=128}} The dialect of [[Udvarhelyszék]] is closely related to the Hungarian variant spoken in [[Burgenland]] (now in [[Austria]]).{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=128}} The third Hungarian variant of the [[Székely Land]] is similar to the Hungarian dialect of Baranya County.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=128}}

Székely and [[Pechenegs|Pecheneg]] warriors fought side by side in the army of [[Stephen II of Hungary]] in the [[Battle of Olšava]] in 1116, according to the 14th-century ''[[Illuminated Chronicle]]''.{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=161}}{{sfn|Kordé|2001|p=35}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003b|pp=96-97}} The author of the chronicle blamed the Székelys and Pechenegs for the king's defeat, calling them as "the most wretched poltroons"&lt;ref&gt;''The Hungarian Illuminated Chronicle'' (ch. 153), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; because of their unexpected retreat from the battlefield.{{sfn|Kordé|2001|p=35}} Györffy argues, thir flight from the battlefield was actually a [[feigned retreat]] which was an element of nomadic military tactics.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=12}} The same source recorded that the "wretched" Pechenges and the "worthless" Székelys "as usual went before the Hungarian army" in the [[Battle of the Fischa]] in 1146, evidencing that they fought in the vanguard.{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=161}}{{sfn|Kordé|2001|p=35}}{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=37}} The derogatory adjectives show that the Székelys were lightly armored archers.{{sfn|Kristó|2003b|p=97}}

The Székelys were divided into six "kindreds";&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Halom, Örlőcz, Jenő, Meggyes, Adorján and Ábrán.&lt;/ref&gt; and each "kindred" was composed of four "lineages".{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=51}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=179}} All kindreds were documented in each district in Székely Land, implying that the kindreds had come into being by the time the Székelys settled in the territory.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=51}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=179}} The names of two kindreds&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Adorján and Ábrán.&lt;/ref&gt; and five lineages&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Balázs, Gyerő, György, Karácson and Péter.&lt;/ref&gt; had their roots in Christian names.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=51}}

The exact date of the settlement of the Székelys in [[Transylvania]] cannot be determined.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=117}}{{sfn|Kordé|2001|p=64}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|pp=161-162}} Simon of Kéza wrote that the Székelys "acquired part of the country ... not in the plains of Pannonia but in the mountains, which they shared with the [[Vlachs]], mingling with them, it is said".&lt;ref name=Simon_of_Keza_ch21_p71&gt;''Simon of Kéza: The Deeds of the Hungarians'' (ch. 21.), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=9}} [[Gyula Kristó]] says that the increase of the military role of the eastern borderlands caused their movement, because skirmishes along the western frontier became rare during the 12th century.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=128}} [[Pál Engel]], [[Zoltán Kordé]] and [[Tudor Sălăgean]] argue that the [[kings of Hungary]] settled the Székelys in Transylvania in several stages.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=117}}{{sfn|Kordé|2001|p=64}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|pp=161-162}} Kristó adds, several Székely border guards voluntarily left for Transylvania, because the disintegration of the ''marchias'' (or border counties) threatened their freedom.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=128}}

The first groups allegedly settled in southern Transylvania,{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|pp=161-162}} along the rivers [[Saschiz River|Kézd]], [[Gârbova River (Secaș)|Orbó]], and [[Sebeș (river)|Sebes]] (now Saschiz, Gârbova and Sebeș in Romania), because three administrative units in Székely Land{{mdash}}[[Kézdiszék]], [[Orbaiszék]] and [[Sepsiszék]]{{mdash}}were named after these rivers.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=131}} Early 12th-century cemeteries unearthed at [[Szászsebes]] and [[Homoróddaróc]] (now Sebeș and Drăuşeni in Romania) evidence that the region had been inhabited before the arrival of the ancestors of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]].{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=352-353}} The Székelys who lived around [[Tileagd|Telegd]] in Bihar County (now Tileagd in Romania) also moved to Transylvania, because a group of the Székelys was known as the Székelys of Telegd in the 13th century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=15}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=130}}

[[Joachim Türje|Joachim]], [[Count of Hermannstadt]], led an army of Saxons, Vlachs, Székelys and Pechenegs across the Carpathian Mountains to fight for [[Boril of Bulgaria]] around 1210, according to a royal charter issued in 1250.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=17}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=385}} The record suggests that the four ethnic groups were subjected to the Counts of Hermannstadt in the early 13th century.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=132}} 
William, [[Bishop of Transylvania]], granted the [[tithe]] in [[Burzenland]] to the [[Teutonic Knights]] in 1213, but preserved the right to collect the tithe from the Székelys (and Hungarians) who would settle in the region.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=132}} The grant shows that significant Székely groups were on the move in the early 13th century.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=132}} The "land of the Székelys" was located to the north and northeast of the domain of the Knights in 1222.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=405}} Two years later, Andrew II granted the land of the Székelys of Sebes to the west of the [[Olt River]] to the Transylvanian Saxons, thus uniting the territories where Saxons had settled in southern Transylvania under the jurisdiction of the Count of Hermannstadt.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=132}}

The adoption of more than a dozen place names of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Including, [[Cașin River (Râul Negru)|Kászon]] ("sour"), [[Kálnok]] ("muddy"), and [[Bölön]] ("[[henbane]]").&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that scattered Slavic-speaking communities inhabited present-day Székely Land at the time of the Székelys' arrival.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|pp=38, 132}} More than a dozen place names representing the oldest layer of Hungarian place names (personal names in the [[nominative case]]),&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, [[Dârjiu|Székely'''derzs''']] and [[Tărceşti|'''Tarcsa'''falva]].&lt;/ref&gt; implies that other Hungarian-speaking groups had also preceded the Székelys.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=14}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|pp=58-59, 134-135}} The same conclusion can be drawn from the existence of the enclaves of [[Fehér County (former)|Fehér County]] in Székely Land which survived until the 19th century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=14}}

=== High Middle Ages ===

[[File:Székely Land.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|right|alt=Székely Land in medieval Transylvania|Székely Land (in blue) in [[Transylvania]] within the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]]]]

The Székelys were put under the jurisdiction of a new royal official, the [[Count of the Székelys]], in the early 13th century.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=133}} The first known count, [[Bogomer Ludány|Bogomer, son of Szoboszló]], was captured during a campaign that [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla]], [[Duke of Transylvania]], launched against [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] in 1228.{{sfn|Kristó|2003b|pp=141-142}} The monarchs always appointed the counts from among the [[Hungarian nobility|Hungarian noblemen]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=22}} The main administrative units of Székely Land were initially known as ''"terra"'' (or land).{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=24}} The ''[[Diploma Andreanum]]'' contained the first reference to such a territory, mentioning ''terra Sebes'' ("the land of the Székelys of Sebes") in 1224.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=24}}

The [[Mongol invasion of the Kingdom of Hungary]] obviously caused less destruction in Székely Land than in other regions of Hungary.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=16-17}} Only two years after the withdrawal of the Mongols, Székely troops accompanied [[Lawrence of Transylvania|Lawrence]], [[Voivode of Transylvania]], to the [[Principality of Halych-Volhynia]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=17}} Székely warriors fought in the royal army against the Czechs and Austrians in the [[Battle of Kressenbrunn]] in 1260.{{sfn|Kristó|2003b|pp=178-179}} [[Stephen V of Hungary]] granted the royal domains along the [[Arieș River (Mureș)|Aranyos River]] (now Arieș in Romania) to the Székelys of Kézd, who established 18 villages in two decades.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=17}} The Mongols [[Second Mongol invasion of Hungary|again invaded the Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1285.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=135}} The Székelys, Vlachs and Saxons resisted the invaders at the border, hindering their sudden attack.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=137}} The Székelys of Aranyos successfully defended [[Torockó]] (now Rimetea in Romania), forcing the invaders to set hundreds of captives free.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=136}}
 
The Székelys did not receive a royal diploma summarizing their liberties, but royal charters evidence that they had a special legal status.{{sfn|Kristó|2003|p=133}}{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=46}} The Székelys were not subjected to the authority of the voivodes and the ''[[ispán]]s'' (or heads) of the [[County (Kingdom of Hungary)|counties]].{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=136}} Their landed property could not be confiscated in favor of the royal treasury.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=46}} Neither could the monarchs grant estates in Székely Land.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=46}}{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=137}} Béla IV, who wanted to reward one ''Comes'' Vincent for his services, donated him an estate in Fehér County (outside Székely Land) in 1252.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=18, 46}} Vincent was obviously the head of a Székely kindred, because four families&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Mikó, [[Mikes family|Mikes]], Nemes and Kálnoky families.&lt;/ref&gt; which descended from him gave the highest officials of [[Sepsiszék]] for centuries.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=18, 51}} The Székelys prevented two noblemen from taking possession of an estate (Lok) that [[Charles I of Hungary]] had granted them in [[Csíkszék|Csík]] in 1324.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=137}}

Instead of individuals, the community owned most lands in Székely Land.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=41, 46}} [[Stephen V of Hungary]] had to instruct the ''universitas'' (or community) of the Székelys of Telegd in the early 1270s to receive two men into their society, allowing them to hold their estates "without borders, like the Székelys".{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=136}} Parcels of the communal lands were time to time divided through "drawing arrows".{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=41, 46}} Communal property diminished through [[deforestation]] and the draining of marshlands, because such territories were seized by the individuals who had transformed the land.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=50}} The Székelys did not pay taxes, but the owners of landed property in Székely Land were required to serve in the royal army.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=46-47}} Daughters could only inherit landed property if they had no brothers.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=46}} A daughter who inherited an estate (known as a "boy-daughter") had to equip a warrior to fight on her behalf.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=46}} The Székelys gave 80 horses to [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary]] in the late 13th century.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=136}}{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=46}} Later, each Székely household was required to give an ox to the king on the occasions of his marriage and the birth of his eldest son.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=47}}

The Székelys' collective privileges strengthened in the 1290s.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=137}} Their representatives attained the general assembly that [[Andrew III of Hungary]] held at [[Gyulafehérvár]] (now Alba Iulia in Romania) in 1291.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=154}} Ehelleus Ákos, Vice-Voivode of Transylvania, granted the fortress on Székelykő at Torockó (now Piatra Secuiului in Romania) to the Székelys of Aranyos.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=182}} The Székelys were also represented at the [[Diet of Hungary]] in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in 1298.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=137}}{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=156}}

Taking advantage of the collapse of the royal authority, [[Ladislaus III Kán]] took control of Transylvania in the 1290s.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=84}} In 1296, he held a general assembly near Torda (now [[Turda]] in Romania) where the head of the Székelys of Aranyos were also present.{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=195}} However, the Székelys did not support his sons' rebellion against Charles I of Hungary in the late 1310s.{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=231}}{{sfn|Sălăgean|2016|p=195}}

[[File:Székely Seats.PNG|thumb|upright=1.5|right|alt=Székely seats|Székely [[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|seats]] in Transylvania ([[Aranyosszék]] is not presented)]]

The register of the papal tithe (the tenth part of each clergyman's revenues which was to be paid to the pope) between 1330 and 1337 is the first document to provide detailed information of the [[Parish (Catholic Church)|Roman Catholic parishes]] in Székely Land.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=18}} At least 150 parishes were mentioned in the document, showing that a church had been built in at least 80% of the villages (this ratio did not exceed 40% in other regions of the kingdom).{{sfn|Kristó|2003a|p=135}} The parishes were divided among four [[Deanery|archdeaneries]]&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Deaneries of Telegd, Gyulafehérvár, Kézd and Torda.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Transylvania]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=19}} The presence of Orthodox communities in this period has not been demonstrated.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=21}}

The Székely administrative units were known as ''széks'' (or [[Seat (territorial-administrative unit)|seats]]) from the middle of the 14th century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=24}} There were initially seven seats,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Aranyosszék, Csíkszék, Kézdiszék, [[Marosszék]], Orbaiszék, Sepsiszék and Udvarhelyszék.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Stibor of Stiboricz]], Voivode of Transylvania, authorized the community of [[Miklósvár]] (now Micloșoara in Romania) to set up its own court of justice around 1395. The other seats only acknowledged the establishment of [[Miklósvárszék]] in 1459.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=30-32}} Each seat was headed by two elected officials, the lieutenant ''(maior exercitus)'' and the seat judge ''(iudex terrestris)''.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=40}}{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=13}} Theoretically, lieutenants were responsible for the military affairs and seat judges administered justice, but lieutenants also heard legal disputes.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=40}} Both seat judges and lieutenants heard disputes together with twelve jurors.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=48}}

Only Székelys who owned landed property known as "Székely inheritance" could be elected lieutenants or seat judges.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=17}} Such property almost always included a mill, increasing the revenues of its owner.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=17}} "Székely inheritances" were divided among the lineages, because the right to nominate and elect the officials of a seat moved from lineage to lineage in each year.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=17}} Consequently, members of the families who owned more than one "Székely inheritance" held the offices more frequently than others.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=17}}

Most Székely villages were named either after a lineage,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, [[Udvarfalva]] and [[Meggyesfalva]] (now Curteni and Mureșeni, respectively in Romania).&lt;/ref&gt; or after individuals,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, [[Erdőszentgyörgy]] (now Sângeorgiu de Pădure in Romania) bears the name of one ''"Erdew"'' from the Meggyes lineage of the Meggyes kindred, who lived in the mid-14th century.&lt;/ref&gt; known from 13th- and 14th-century charters.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|pp=12, 18}} Unlike the villages in the counties, the Székely villages preserved their autonomous status.{{sfn|Sedlar|1994|p=93}}{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=40}} Ten families made up the basic administrative units (known as "tenth") of Székely Land.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=40}} Tenths supervised the regular division of the communal lands.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=40}}

[[File:Cristuru Secuiesc Catholic Church.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A small church with a tower and a nearby small wooden building|Medieval Roman Catholic church in [[Székelykeresztúr]] (present-day Cristuru Secuiesc, Romania)]]

Tenths were also responsible for the mobilization of the Székely warriors.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=40}} The Székelys' military obligations did not diminish in the 14th century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=40}} [[Andrew Lackfi]], Count of the Székelys, launched a campaign against the [[Golden Horde]] in 1345.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=166}} His victory enabled the expansion of Hungary across the Carpathian Mountains and contributed to the [[Founding of Moldavia|establishment of Moldavia]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=166}} Székely troops also participated in the campaigns of [[Louis I of Hungary]] in Italy, Lithuania, Serbia and Bulgaria.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=58}} [[Stephen Kanizsai]] commanded the Székely warriors in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]],{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=58}} which ended with the catastrophic defeat of the Christian army by the Ottomans in 1396.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=166}}

The Székelys primarily grew grain, [[onion]], [[cabbage]], [[hops]], [[hemp]] and [[flax]] in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=75}} [[Apple]], [[pear]], [[plum]], [[walnut]] and [[hazelnut]] were the characteristic fruits of Székely Land.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=75}} The breeding of horses and cattle was also important segment of the local economy.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=75}} The Székelys also traded in skins of wolves, foxes, squirrels, martens and other wild animals.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=75}} The [[staple right]]{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} of the Saxon town of Brassó hindered the development of the nearby Székely towns, especially that of [[Sepsiszentgyörgy]] (now Sfântu Gheorghe in Romania).{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=43}} A royal charter recorded that a town was located in each seat in 1427, but most towns received privileges only during the following century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=43}}

The existence of legally distinct groups of the Székely society was first documented in the early 15th century, but the origin of the three main groups can be traced back to the previous centuries.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=50-51}} Archaeologist Elek Benkő proposes that the tripartite Székely community (consisting of the high-ranking ''primores'' and ''primipili'', and the commoners) preserved the features of the 11th-century Hungarian society.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=12}} The number of Székelys who could not secure their living increased due to the divisions of landed property through inheritance in the 15th century.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}} The poor entered the service of wealthy landowners.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|pp=236-237}} On the other hand, Székelys who participated in military campaigns had the opportunity to receive land grants outside Székely Land.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=14}} Hungarian noblemen could seize a "Székely inheritance" through marriage or purchase.{{sfn|Benkő|Székely|2008|p=18, 24}} Consequently, the wealthiest landowners held offices in both the seats and the counties.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|pp=209, 236}} For their estates in the counties were cultivated by dependent peasants, they also wanted to reduce the freedom of the commoners who worked on their estates in Székely Land.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}}

The Hungarian and Vlach peasants rose up in the Transylvanian counties in spring 1437.{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=258}} Roland Lépes, Vice-Voivode of Transylvania, sought assistance from the Székelys and Saxons against them.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|pp=226}} The representatives of the counties and the Székely and Saxon seats assembled at Bábolna (now [[Bobâlna]] in Romania).{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=277}} They signed a "brotherly union" on 16 September, pledging that they would assist each other against all but the monarch.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=277}}{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=110}} After their united army defeated the peasants, they confirmed their alliance on 2 February 1438, which gave rise to the concept of the "[[Three Nations of Transylvania]]".{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=277}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|pp=226}}

Ottoman marauders made regulars incursions in Transylvania from the early 15th century.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=224}} Ottoman raiders routed an army of Székelys and Saxons at Brassó (now [[Brașov]] in Romania) in 1421; Ottoman, Wallachian and Moldavian troops made an incursion in Székely Land in 1432; Ottomans broke into Székely Land in 1438.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=224}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=259}} [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of Hungary, had already in 1419 ordered that a third of the Transylvanian noblemen and a tenth of the peasants had to take up arms in case of an Ottoman invasion to assist the Székelys and Saxons in defending the borders.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=224}} The churches of Székely Land reflected a "frontier-guard mentality".{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=240}} Churches in Csíkszék were fortified in the 15th century.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=242}} Frescoes on the walls of many churches represented [[Ladislaus I of Hungary|King St Ladislaus's]] legendary fight with a "Cuman" warrior.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|pp=240-241}} Episodes of the life of [[Saint Margaret of Antioch]] were also depicted on the walls of at least 8 churches.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=241}} Most frescoes were painted in Byzantine style.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=241}} The first references to Székely primary schools were recorded in the 15th century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=141}} A schoolmaster lived in [[Hídvég]] (now Hăghig in Romania), and a teacher in [[Előpatak]] (now Vâlcele) in 1419.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=141}}

To secure the unified command of the borders, [[Vladislaus I of Hungary]] made [[John Hunyadi]], [[Ban of Szörény]], and [[Nicholas Újlaki]], [[Ban of Macsó]], the joint voivodes of Transylvania and counts of the Székelys in 1441.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=227}} Székely warriors accompanied Hunyadi during his campaigns in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=61}} At Hunyadi's order, Nicholas Vízaknai, Vice-Voivode of Transylvania, and John Geréb of Vingárt, Castellan of [[Gurghiu, Mureș|Görgény]] (now Gurghiu in Romania), held an assembly for 24 Székely jurors in Marosvásárhely in 1451 to record customary laws.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=61}} This first known legislative assembly of the Székelys decreed that those who possessed landed property for 32 years [[adverse possession|acquired the title to it]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=61}}

Hunyadi's son, [[Matthias Corvinus]], was elected king in 1458.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=298}} He confirmed the right of the Székelys of Kászon region to freely elect a lieutenant and a seat judge in 1462.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=62}} The offices of voivode of Transylvania and count of the Székelys were in practise united in the 1460s, because thereafter the kings always appointed the same noblemen to both offices.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=115}} To secure the military potential of the Székely community, Matthias ordered the collection of the liberties of the commoners in 1466.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}} The joint assembly of the Transylvanian noblemen and the Székely elders decreed that a Székely could not be forced to work on a landowner's estate.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}} The assembly also ruled that two-thirds of the jurors were to be elected from among the commoners.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}} Thereafter, the counts of the Székelys appointed a "[[royal judge]]" (or ''iudex regius'') to supervise the administration of justice in each seat.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}}

Impoverished Székely commoners, however, could not fight as mounted warriors, forcing Matthias to revise his policy.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}} In 1473, he issued a new decree which distinguished the military obligations of the three main Székely groups.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}} The ''pimores'', who owned an estate with a territory of at least three "bowshots", were thereafter required to equip three mounted warriors.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=236}} The ''primipili'', who owned an estate with a territory of two "bowshots", continued to fight as mounted soldiers in person.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=237}} The Székely commoners, or ''pixidarii'', were obliged to fight only as foot-soldiers.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=50}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=237}}

[[Stephen V Báthory|Stephen Báthory]], Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys, made several attempts to reduce the autonomy of the seats in the early 1490s.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=66}} Accusing many ''primores'' of high treason, he confiscated their estates and forced Székely heiresses to marry his retainers.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=66-67}} At the Székelys' demand, [[Vladislaus II of Hungary]] replaced Báthory with [[Bertalan Drágffy, Count of the Székelys|Bartholomew Drágffy]] and Stephen Losonczy in 1493.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=67}} However, Drágffy, Losonczy and their successors neglected the administration of justice.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=68}} János Bögözi, Lieutenant of Udvarhelyszék, convoked the general assembly, which set up an [[appellate court]] in 1505.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=68}}

The Székelys' self-consciousness strengthened after their identifications as Huns was published in printed books in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=237}} They regarded themselves as the representatives of the Huns' military virtues and began demanding the recognition of their privileged status.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=237}} After King Vladislaus II's only son, Louis, was born on 1 July 1506, royal officials came to Székely Land to collect the oxen which had traditionally been given to the monarchs on similar occasions.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=237}} However, the custom had been forgotten, because the kings had not fathered sons during the previous century.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=70}} Stating that they were noblemen (who did not pay taxes), the Székelys refused to give oxen to the royal officials.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=237}} The commander of the royal army, [[Pál Tomori]], could only suppress the riot with the assistance of Saxon troops.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=238}} András Lázár convoked a new general assembly to [[Agyagfalva]] (now Lutiţa in Romania), which banished those who had conspired against the monarch and confiscated their landed property.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=72}}

The leader of the great uprising of the Hungarian peasants in 1514, [[György Dózsa]], was of Székely origin, but the Székely commoners did not support the rebels.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=238}} [[John Zápolya]], who had been count of the Székelys since 1510,{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=238}} played a preeminent role in the victory of the noblemen over the peasants.{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=363-364}} He also suppressed a revolt of the Székely commoners in 1519.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=238}} He ignored the special status of landed property in Székely Land and confiscated the rioters' estates in favor of the royal treasury.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=238}}

In 1538, John recognized Ferdinand's right to reunite Hungary after his death.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=140}} However, John's supporters proclaimed his infant son, [[John Sigismund Zápolya|John Sigismund]], king after he died in 1540.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=142}} Taking advantage of the new civil war, Suleiman occupied central Hungary, but allowed John Sigismund to retain the lands to the east of the [[Tisza River]].{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=142}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=281}} The minor king and his mother, [[Isabella Jagiellon]], settled in Transylvania in 1542.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=253}}

[[Johannes Honter]], the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] priest of Brassó, sent preachers to Székely Land in the 1540s.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=96-97}} The wealthy Pál Daczó, who renovated the old church of Sepsiszentgyörgy (now Sfântu Gheorghe in Romania) "for the glory of God" in 1547, was the first Székely to certainly adopt Lutheranism.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=97}} Most villages in Miklósvárszék adhered to Lutheranism by the early 1550s,{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=97}} but the majority of the Székelys remained Roman Catholic.{{sfn|Keul|2009|p=102}} The Reformation also contributed to the development of education.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=141}} New schools were opened in dozens of settlements, including [[Székelykál]] and [[Gidófalva]] (now Căluşeri and Ghidfalău in Romania).{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=141}} The high schools at Marosvásárhely and Székelyudvarhely became the first institutions of secondary education.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=143}}

Transylvania sank into political anarchy during the following years.{{sfn|Keul|2009|p=142}} Rudolph's general, [[Giorgio Basta]], expelled Michael from Transylvania and abolished the Székelys' liberties.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=296}} [[Moses Székely]] (the only prince of Székely origin) took up arms against Basta in 1603.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=297}} Most Székelys of Udvarhelyszék, Marosszék and Aranyosszék supported him, but the majority of the Székelys from other seats joined his opponent, [[Radu Șerban]], Voivode of Wallachia.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=105-106}} János Petki, Captain of Udvarhelyszék, convoked the general assembly of the Székelys shortly after Stephen Bocskai had risen up against Rudolph in October 1604.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=111}} The Székely noblemen and commoners unanimously decided to support Bocskai if he was willing to confirm their liberties and to grant a general amnesty for the crimes committed during the anarchy.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=111}} Bocskai confirmed the Székelys' liberties in a charter on 16 February 1606.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=112}} Five days later, the delegates of the counties and the Székelys proclaimed him prince.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=112}}

The army of Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] occupied Transylvania in late 1687.{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=354}} He restored civil government in 1690, by issuing the ''[[Diploma Leopoldinum]]'' which confirmed the privileges of the Three Nations.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=371}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|pp=354-355}} However, five years later, the imperial army again occupied the principality.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=372}} The new government increased the taxes and strengthened the position of the Roman Catholic Church, which stirred up discontent.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=374}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=356}} The increase of the taxes especially aggrieved the Székely villages, but the commander of the imperial army, Jean-Louis Rabutin de Bussy, suppressed all riots, imprisoning many Székelys.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=377}}

[[Francis II Rákóczi]] (a descendant of the [[Rákóczi]] princes of Transylvania) became the leader of the opposition against Leopold.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=185-186}} After taking control of [[Upper Hungary]] (now Slovakia) and large territories to the east of the Tisza in autumn 1703, he sent letters to the Three Nations (and also to the Romanians), urging them to support his war for independence.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=377}} The Székelys of Háromszék and Csíkszék were among the first to join him.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=158}} Rákóczi's supporters took control of Székely Land by early 1704.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=158}}

The Diet proclaimed Rákóczi prince,{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=187}} but he could not enter Transylvania after the imperial army defeated his supporters in the [[Battle of Zsibó]] on 11 November 1705.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=159-160}} Székely Land was put under military administration and hundreds of Székelys left the principality.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=160}} The authorities limited free movement and began collecting all weapons.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=160}} The Székely soldiers returned under the command of Lőrinc Pekry in summer 1706.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=160}} Rákóczi, who was again elected prince, confirmed the Székelys' privileges in 1707.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=160}}

Leopold's successor, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], promised a general amnesty to those who would capitulate.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=381}} After Rákóczi left Hungary for Poland to seek assistance, the representatives of the rebels signed the [[Treaty of Szatmár]] in 1711, acknowledging the rule of the Habsburgs.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=189}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=359}} The Székely [[Kelemen Mikes]] was one of the few noblemen who followed Rákóczi into exile.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=160}} Mikes's ''[[Letters from Turkey]]'' demonstrate both his education in France and his Transylvanian heritage.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=411}}

=== Towards absolutism ===

The integration of Transylvania into the [[Habsburg Empire]] accelerated after the Treaty of Szatmár.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=415}} The Gubernium (which was composed of 12 members appointed by the monarchs) became the supreme body of administration, but the most important decisions were made in Vienna.{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=413}} The Diet enacted the decisions of the Gubernium without opposition.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=430}} The command of the imperial and local troops was unified in 1713.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=415}}{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=413}} Appeals against the decisions of the seat courts were heard at the Royal Table.{{sfn|Pop|Bolovan|2006|p=414}} Since the monarchs supported the ideas of [[Counter-Reformation]], many Székely noble families&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, the Apors and Kálnokys.&lt;/ref&gt; converted to Catholicism.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=164}} The Unitarians and Sabbatarians were especially exposed to persecution in the 1720s.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=415}} The Diet was last summoned in 1761.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=431}}

Around 20% of the Transylvanian population perished because of a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] between 1717 and 1720.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=417}} Migration of serfs to Moldavia and Wallachia continued, but most migrants returned to Transylvania.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=418}} The Székely commoners and ''primipili'' made attempts to regain their tax exempt status, but their movements were suppressed.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=164}} Their largest rebellion broke out after [[Adolf Nikolaus Buccow]], the military commander, decided to introduce the system of the [[Military Frontier]] in Székely Land in 1762, without consulting with the Diet or the seats.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=166}}

[[File:Siculicidium emlékmű.jpg|thumb|left|Monument to the ''[[Siculicidium]]'' (or Massacre of Székelys) at [[Madéfalva]] (now Siculeni in Romania)]]

Buccow ordered the conscription of the commoners and ''primipili'' to set up new border guard troops, appointing German officers to complete the task.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=166}} Referring to their traditional privileges, most Székelys declared that they would only serve under the command of their own officers.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=167}} However, some commoners were ready to accept the new system and the imperial officials also promised freedom to the serfs who joined the new army.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=418}} They turned against those who resisted, attacking their houses and villages.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=433}}

Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] appointed a new official, [[József Siskovics]], to complete the organization of the Military Frontier.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=433}} Siskovics sent 10-20 soldiers to each villages, declaring that he would confiscated the landed property of those who resisted.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=169}} Most Székelys in [[Gyergyó]] yielded, but the men from [[Madéfalva]] (now Siculeni in Romania) and the nearby villages fled to the mountains.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=169}} After Siskovics ordered the expulsion of their wives and children from their houses, more than 2,700 armed Székelys came to Madéfalva from Háromszék and Csíkszék.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=170}} The imperial army attacked the village, slaughtering more than 200 Székelys on 7 January 1764.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=170}}

The ''[[Siculicidium]]'' (or Massacre of Székelys) at Madéfalva broke the Székelys' resistance.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=433}} The organization of the Székely border guard was completed before the end of March.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=433}} Two infantry regiments were set up in Csíkszék and Háromszék, and one ''[[hussar]]'' regiment in Csíkszék, Háromszék and Aranyosszék.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=176}} Romanian peasants from Aranyosszék made up more than a fifth of the ''hussar'' regiment.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=176}} Thousands of Székelys fled to Moldavia instead of joining the army.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=170}}

== Grand Principality of Transylvania ==

=== Enlightment and absolutism ===
{{See also|Székelys of Bukovina}}

Maria Theresa declared Transylvania to be a grand principality on 2 November 1765.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=755}} The partial integration of Székely Land in the Military Frontier divided the society into a military and a civil part.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=176}} In the Military Frontier, most commoners and ''primipili'' joined the regiments.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=178}} In addition to the defence of the frontier, the border guards were obliged to chase robbers and smugglers.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=172}} The military commanders supervised the election of the magistrates, which diminished the autonomy of the Székely villages.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=433}} Many aspects of everyday life were also controlled by the officers: the border guards could only marry with the consent of their commanders and the officers were authorized to ban smoking and dancing.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=434}}

More than 44% of the inhabitants of Székely Land were commoners and ''primipili'' in the late 1760s, but the ratio of serfs and landless cotters exceeded 38%.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=177}} The settlement of Romanian peasants in Csíkszék, Háromszék and Aranyosszék contributed to the increase of their number.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=177}} [[Romani people|Romani]] (or Gypsy) cotters were also mentioned in the 1760s.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=177}} Many of them were employed as blacksmiths and musicians in the noblemen's manors.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=182}} To regulate the obligations of the peasantry, the Gubernium issued a decree (the so-called ''Certain Points'') in 1769, prescribing that they were to work four or three days a week on the estates of the noblemen.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=434}} Nevertheless, the peasants in Székely Land enjoyed more freedom than the serfs in the counties.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=181}} For instance, Székely serfs run taverns and butcheries together with the noblemen, while it was the noblemen's monopoly in the counties.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=181}}

The ideas of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] spread in Transylvania from the 1770s.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=435}} The [[polymath]] [[József Benkő]] (who was a Calvinist priest) wrote a trilingual botanical dictionary and a manual of caves.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=436}} He also promoted tobaccoo growing and the use of [[sumac]] in the leather industry.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=436}}

Maria Theresa's son and successor, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], wanted to transform the Habsburg Empire into a unitary state.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=212}} He abolished the seats and divided Transylvania into eleven counties in 1784.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=446}} He made German the official language of the central government and the towns.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=447}} The representatives of the noblemen and the Székelys wrote a joint memorandum to perusade him to withdraw his reforms in 1787, but he revoked most of his decrees only on his deathbed in 1790.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|pp=447-448}} At the Diet that Joseph's successor, [[Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold II]], convoked in December 1790, the Székely [[György Aranka]] proposed the establishment of the [[Transylvanian Hungarian Philological Society]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=190-191}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=449}} On the other hand, the Székely delegates did not support the proposed union of Transylvania with Hungary, because they feared that it would jeopardize their traditional liberties.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=450}}

Transylvanian culture flourished in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=454}} [[Farkas Bolyai]] improved the teaching of natural sciences at the college of Marosvásárhely.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=190}} [[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma]], who left Székely Land for Central Asia to search for the Hungarians' ancient homeland, compiled the first Tibetan-English dictionary.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=190-191}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=456}} [[Sándor Farkas Bölöni]] published a book about his journeys in England and the United States, describing the latter as the country of "common sense".{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=190-191}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=462}} Székely noblemen&lt;ref group="note"&gt;For instance, Baron Zsigmond Szentkereszti, László Berzenczey and Mihály Mikó.&lt;/ref&gt; and scholars&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Including, Mózes Berde and Dániel Fábián.&lt;/ref&gt; who adopted the ideas of [[Liberalism]] demanded the unification of Hungary and Transylvania.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=193}} However, [[Conservatism|Conservative]] noblemen&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Baron Lázár Apor, Lajos Matskási and Ferenc Tholdalagi.&lt;/ref&gt; headed the seats.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=193}}

=== Revolution ===

{{Further information|Hungarian Revolution of 1848}}

[[File:Háromszék székház.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of the Háromszék Assembly in [[Sepsiszentgyörgy]] ({{lang-ro|[[Sfântu Gheorghe]]}}) in the 19th century]]

A group of young artists and scholars published the [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|reform program of the radical delegates]] of the [[Diet of Hungary]] without official authorization in [[Buda]] (the capital of Hungary) on 15 March 1848.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|pp=247-248}} Six days later the radical burghers and students of Kolozsvár accepted a similar program, in which they also demanded a remedy to the grievances of the Székely people.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=195}} Before long, the assemblies of the Székely seats replaced the Conservative royal judges with Liberal politicians.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=195}}

The Diet of Transylvania, which was dominated by ethnic Hungarian delegates, voted for the union of Transylvania and Hungary on 30 May.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=99}} The Diet also abolished serfdom on 6 June.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=496}} The new law secured a plot of land even for the cotters, with the exception of those who had settled in a "Székey inheritance", because the division of the properties of free Székelys would have created thousands of smallholders living below the level of subsistence.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=199}} The population of Székely Land had doubled between 1767 and 1846,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The 1767 census recorded 37,145 families, suggesting that more than 185,000 people lived in Székely Land. According to the 1846 census, 379,500 people lived in the seats.&lt;/ref&gt; but the territory of arable lands could not be increased.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=184, 203}} [[Zsigmond Perényi (1783–1849)|Zsigmond Perényi]] (whom the Diet of Hungary appointed to study the problem) proposed that the landless Székely peasants should be settled in [[Banat]].{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=203}}

[[Lajos Batthyány]], [[Prime Minister of Hungary]], urged the Székelys to take up arms for the revolutionary government.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=200}} Before long, three Székely battalions joined the Hungarian army and fought against [[Josip Jelačić]], [[Ban of Croatia]], who had turned against the Hungarian government.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=200}} The government dissolved the Military Frontier to abolish the authority of the imperial officials over the Székely regiments.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=508}} Most Romanians and Saxons, who opposed the union of Transylvania and Hungary, sided with the royal court, which caused a civil war.{{sfn|Hitchins|2014|p=99}}{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|pp=501, 506-508}} Before long, hundreds of Hungarians were massacred in the counties.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=510}}

Batthyány's commissioner, László Berzenczey convoked the general assembly of the Székelys to Agyagfalva, threatening those who would not attend with capital punishment in accordance with customary law.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=508}} On 18 October, the assembly declared that all Székelys were equal before the law.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=208}} An army of 30,000 strong was set up.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=208}} The Székely troops pillaged the Saxon town of [[Szászrégen]] (now Reghin in Romania), but the canons of the imperial army forced them to flee from the battlefield at Marosvásárhely.{{sfn|Barta|Bóna|Köpeczi|Makkai|1994|p=512}} Before long, imperial troops occupied Marosszék and Udvarhelyszék, but the Székelys of Háromszék resisted till the end of 1848, preventing General Anton Puchner from assisting the imperial army in Hungary.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|pp=209-211}} The dozens of canons that [[Áron Gábor]] (a former artillery officer) produced during the fights contributed to the success of the resistance.{{sfn|Egyed|2013|p=210-211}}

By the end of 1848 - beginning of 1849, Székelys joined the army set up by General [[Józef Bem]] and took part in his successful campaigns driving out Habsburg troops from Transylvania. The successful campaign was finally crushed when the imperial Russian army intervened in Transylvania following a request from the Habsburg Empire.

==Union with Hungary==
[[File:Hungarians in Hungary (1890).png|thumb|230px|Proportion of Hungarians in Hungary, 1890 census based on the most commonly spoken languages]]
In 1867, an agreement ([[Ausgleich|Compromise]]) was made between Austria and Hungary about the creation of the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy]]. According to the Compromise, Transylvania was united with the Kingdom of Hungary. A decade later, a [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|new county system]] was introduced in the Kingdom, which put an end to the long tradition of Székely Seats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5427">'''Homersham Cox''' (1821–1897) was an English lawyer and judge, mathematician and historian.&lt;ref name="Venn"&gt;{{acad|CS839H|Cox, Homersham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born at [[Newington, Surrey]], the fourth son of Edward Treslove, and was educated at [[Tonbridge School]]. He entered [[Jesus College, Cambridge]] in 1839,  graduating B.A. in 1844, and M.A. 1852. He was admitted to the [[Inner Temple]] in 1845, and was [[called to the Bar]] 1851.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt;

Made a [[County Court]] judge in Wales, Cox caused a furore by saying that [[perjury]] was endemic in Welsh courts. He was shortly moved to [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Polden|title=A History of the County Court, 1846-1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pTSc60VV1b0C&amp;pg=PA255|accessdate=8 March 2013|date=4 November 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43126-2|page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cox died on 10 March 1897, at Marl Field House, Tonbridge.&lt;ref name="Venn"/&gt;

==Works==
In the late 1840s Cox did theoretical work on the strength and elasticity of materials, following up experimental work of [[Eaton Hodgkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. M. Charlton|title=A History of the Theory of Structures in the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-R4d1ROpPoC&amp;pg=PA161|accessdate=8 March 2013|date=4 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52482-7|pages=161–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Eberhard|title=IUTAM Symposium on Multiscale Problems in Multibody System Contacts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ibzNd68T3egC&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=8 March 2013|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-5981-0|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter O.

In ''The Institutions of the English Government'' (1863), Cox argued in terms of a constitutional "balance of powers", at variance with the contemporary theorists [[Walter Bagehot]] and [[A. V. Dicey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H. J.

It was brought out in time for the [[1868 United Kingdom General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Saunders|title=Democracy and the Vote in British Politics, 1848-1867: The Making of the Second Reform Act|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAvicemh3-gC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=8 March 2013|date=1 February 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-1795-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a critic of the cross-party co-operation seen in passing the [[Reform Bill of 1867]], arguing that democracy was being undermined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Asa Briggs]]|title=Victorian People: A Reassessment of Persons and Themes, 1851-67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meMxXouCi5wC&amp;pg=PA280-IA2|accessdate=8 March 2013|year=1955|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-07488-7|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works were:

*''The British Commonwealth, Or, A Commentary on the Institutions and Principles of British Government'' (1854). In it Cox argued that the [[Norman Conquest]] led to attempt to break down the local Anglo-Saxon political institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Tristram Hunt]]|title=Building Jerusalem: The Rise and Fall of the Victorian City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RppyA6KB9fAC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=8 March 2013|date=30 December 2010|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-0-297-86594-0|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1424">'''Institut Jeanne Gatineau''' was a [[French people|French]] cosmetics business which emphasized products for the face and body. The company maintained a ''technologically advanced treatment line.''
Institut Jeanne Gatineau was acquired by [[Revlon]] in February 1980 with the approval of the [[French government]].

The French concern trained professionals and consumers in the techniques of beauty care and makeup. A stock market analyst described the Revlon purchase of Institut Jeanne Gatineau as a positive move in its transition from a cosmetics retailer which emphasized treatment rather than merely a seller of shaded cosmetics and fragrances.&lt;ref&gt;''Revlon Inc. Purchases French Cosmetics Concern'', [[Wall Street Journal]], February 12, 1980, pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institut Jeanne Gatineau salon offered half-hour French facial consultations at its [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] location in February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;''The Half-Hour Lunch Facial:Jeanne Gatineau'', [[New York Times]], February 4, 1990, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia''' ('''INAH''', ''National Institute of Anthropology and History'') is a [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|Mexican federal government]] bureau established in 1939 to guarantee the research, preservation, protection, and promotion of the prehistoric, [[Archaeology|archaeological]], [[Anthropology|anthropological]], [[History|historical]], and [[Paleontology|paleontological]] heritage of [[Mexico]]. Its creation has played a key role in preserving the [[Culture of Mexico|Mexican cultural]] heritage. Its current national headquarters are housed in the [[Palace of the Marqués del Apartado]].

INAH and the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura]] are tasked with cataloging and protecting monuments and buildings regarded as cultural patrimony.&lt;ref name="SEP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comprasep.sep.gob.mx/marco_J/Reglamentos/rmonufram.htm |title=LEY FEDERAL SOBRE MONUMENTOS Y ZONAS ARQUEOLOGICAS, ARTISTICOS E HISTORICOS |publisher=Secretariat of Public Education |accessdate= November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; INAH is entrusted with 'archaeological' (pre-Hispanic and paleontological) and 'historical' (post-Conquest 16th to 19th centuries) structures, zones and remnants, while INBAL is entrusted with 'artistic' buildings and monuments (properties that are of significant aesthetic value as deemed by a commission).&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt; Worthy edifices are catalogued in the ''Registro Público de Monumentos y Zonas Arqueológicos e Históricos'' (Public Register of Archeological and Historic Monuments and Zones).&lt;ref name="SEP"/&gt;

Currently, the INAH carries out its work through a Technical Secretariat which supervises the performance of its main duties and whose tasks are distributed among its seven National Coordination Offices and 31 Regional Centers throughout the [[States of Mexico|states]] of the Mexico.

This bureau is responsible for the over 110,000 historical monuments, built between the 16th and 19th centuries, and for 29,000 of Mexico's estimated 200,000 [[pre-Columbian]] archeological zones found throughout the country. One hundred and fifty of the archeological sites are open to the public.

The INAH also supervises over a hundred museums. These are found across the country and are categorized according to the extension and quality of their collections, geographical locations, and number of visitors. Over 500 [[Teotihuacan]] murals are in storage at the INAH.

'''Joe Dawson''' is a [[fictional character]] from the fictional universe of the [[Highlander (franchise)|''Highlander'' franchise]]. A [[Wikt:mortal|mortal]] [[Watcher (Highlander)|Watcher]], he is portrayed by actor [[Jim Byrnes (actor)|Jim Byrnes]].

== Appearances ==
=== Series ===
Dawson is first introduced in the first episode of season two, "[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep01|The Watchers]]" (1993), as a middle-aged, scholarly man working as a clerk in a bookshop owned by [[James Horton (Highlander)|James Horton]] in [[Seacouver]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States. [[Duncan MacLeod|MacLeod]] has been led there by a clue written by [[Darius (Highlander)|Darius]] on the Fifth chronicle, an old book MacLeod found in Darius' rectory after his death. MacLeod does not know at first that Dawson is his Watcher, but Dawson tells him the truth after MacLeod knocks out two Hunters: "I probably know more about you than you know about yourself. (…) I could tell you the time and place you became Immortal, the name of your first love, but that's not important. What is important, is that you care about mortals, and you don't kill for pleasure."&lt;ref name="TW"&gt;Episode "The Watchers", in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 1.&lt;/ref&gt; When MacLeod doubts his story, Dawson tells him with a smile, "You've been around for four hundred years. You'd feel it if I were lying to you. You can always kill me. But between you and me, I hope you don't have to."&lt;ref name="TW" /&gt; This episode also introduces Dawson's family, his brother-in-law James Horton and his niece, Horton's daughter Lynn. Dawson is stunned to learn that Darius was probably killed by Watchers. Dawson reports this to Horton and has to witness MacLeod's confrontation with Horton. MacLeod finally convinces Dawson he is telling the truth. Dawson and his niece Lynn confront Horton, who is finally injured by MacLeod. Dawson and the Watchers disappear from the bookshop.

In "[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep03|Turnabout]]" (1993), Dawson asks MacLeod to stop Immortal Quenten Barnes. MacLeod agrees because Barnes is threatening his friend Michael Moore. No one realizes that Barnes and Moore are the same person. Conversely, when MacLeod asks him to break the rules of the Watchers to get information, Dawson hesitates before accepting.

In "[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep06|The Zone]]" (1993), Dawson asks MacLeod for help again, to check if the leader of the Zone is Immortal but tells him, "Be careful around Canaan, alright ? I would hate to lose another friend", to which MacLeod retorts, "Since when did we become friends ?"&lt;ref name="TZ"&gt;Episode "The Zone", in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 2.&lt;/ref&gt; When MacLeod tells Dawson Canaan is not immortal, but he still wants more help from Dawson to stop him, MacLeod tells, "There are people that watch and there are people that do."&lt;ref name="TZ" /&gt;

In "[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep12|Under Color of Authority]]" (1994), Dawson mentions bird-watching is a "lot less dangerous than keeping an eye on [MacLeod]" and adds, "You know, maybe we should both stick to watching the birds, MacLeod. That'd be much safer all around."&lt;ref&gt;Episode "The Zone", in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep14|Unholy Alliance]]" (1994), Dawson tells MacLeod two Immortals have been shot by mortals and then beheaded by an Immortal and adds, "You watch yourself, MacLeod."&lt;ref name="UAI"&gt;Episode "Unholy Alliance", in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 5.&lt;/ref&gt; When Dawson learns that the mysterious Immortal is Xavier St. Cloud, he decides to help MacLeod despite MacLeod's warnings. Dawson introduces MacLeod to Barton, Xavier's Watcher, ignoring that Barton is a renegade Watcher helping Xavier and James Horton to behead Immortals. After Horton shots Charlie DeSalvo, Dawson pretends not to know that Horton is still alive. MacLeod meets Horton in the Dawson family crypt and Horton hints that Dawson knew he was alive. MacLeod follows Dawson to a wharf when Dawson meets Horton and see them together. Later, Dawson tells MacLeod, "After you fought with Horton, I had to take him to the hospital. He was dying. (…) He surprised us all. But I made sure he was through with the Watchers, MacLeod."&lt;ref name="UAI" /&gt; When MacLeod angrily asks why Dawson failed to tell him this, Dawson answers, "Because I knew you'd kill him. (…) I've known the man for twenty-five years, he's my sister's husband. I couldn't just let him die. (…) I didn't even know he was here, until you said you saw him... I had to find out why he came back."&lt;ref name="UAI" /&gt; When MacLeod angrily asks what Dawson would have done if he had known what Horton was really doing, Dawson cannot answer. MacLeod is hurt by this breach of trust and answers, "Next time I see you will be the last."&lt;ref name="UAI" /&gt;

In "[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep15|Unholy Alliance Part Two]]" (1994), Dawson tries to regain MacLeod's trust by giving him the address of Xavier and Horton's hiding, telling him, "What's done is done, MacLeod. I can't take it back. (…) Maybe we weren't friends, but we did trust one another once, based on nothing more than a feeling. I just hope you can trust me now. (…) Whether you believe me or not is up to you. But it's the truth."&lt;ref name="UAII"&gt;Episode "Unholy Alliance Part Two", in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 5.&lt;/ref&gt; MacLeod actually finds Xavier and Horton where Dawson told him they were. Later in Paris, Dawson finds Horton as Horton is about to flee in a boat and aims a gun at him. Despite Horton's claim that "we're family,"&lt;ref name="UAII" /&gt; Dawson shoots him. When MacLeod hears the sound of the shot and joins him, Dawson tells him, "We make mistakes... we clean them up."&lt;ref name="UAII" /&gt; The script remarks, "A debt has been repaid."&lt;ref&gt;Episode "Unholy Alliance Part Two", Final Shooting Script, p. 46, in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep22|Counterfeit Part Two]]" (1994), Dawson meets MacLeod and [[Richie Ryan (Highlander)|Richie]] to warn them that Horton might have resurfaced. After MacLeod meets Lisa Milon, a perfect lookalike of his deceased lover Tessa sent by Horton, Richie turns to Dawson for help. Dawson agrees to investigate Lisa. As Horton tries to shoot Dawson, Richie throws himself in front of Dawson and saves his life. Dawson finds extraordinary to witness Richie's death and revival and asks him what it is like to come back. Then he tells Richie, "I owe you one."&lt;ref name="CFII"&gt;Episode "Counterfeit Part Two", in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Dawson prevents Horton from shooting MacLeod in the cemetery where Tessa is buried. After MacLeod kills Horton, Dawson says he will take care of the body.

Dawson eventually opens his own jazz club and bar called Joe's where Dawson himself and several bands perform. Music, indeed jazz music, is a love of Joe's as he is seen performing songs in a few instances. The bar, apart from providing Dawson with an income also acted as a cover for his activities with the Watchers. The bar also acts as a meeting place for other Watchers who may be in the area as Dawson is seen hosting a card game in the bar with other Watchers in attendance. The extent to which the staff of the bar know about the Watchers in never disclosed.

Joe Dawson served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] in [[Vietnam]] under Immortal Andrew Cord. In 1968, after seeing Cord shot, Dawson accidentally stepped on a landmine, blowing him up. He was saved by the resurrected Cord, who carried him on his back the sixteen miles to the nearest field hospital. There he tried to tell the psychiatrist that it had been Cord who had saved him, but was told that Cord was dead. Later, he was told that he had his legs amputated.

Not being able to cope with the loss of his legs, he tried to commit suicide by shooting himself. Before he was able to do that, he was visited by a [[Watcher (Highlander)|Watcher]] named Ian Bancroft, who told him about immortality. Dawson found a new meaning to his life and became a Watcher, owing it, in his perspective, to Andrew Cord. Bancroft would become Dawson's mentor within the Watchers and a close friend. That year, he begun his Watcher career as an historian. He later became a field Watcher, observing Immortals like Roy Ferrer (1971–1974) and Liza Grant (1975–1978), later being assigned to Duncan MacLeod in 1979.

The Watcher oath states that they can only observe and record, but never interfere. Because of the developing friendship between Duncan MacLeod and Dawson, he has been forced to break that oath, almost leading to his execution by his fellow Watchers. Dawson, himself, is shown to be conflicted about breaching his oath; especially during the beginning of his friendship with Duncan. Over the long term however, Dawson forms a strong friendship with Duncan which brings him into conflict with his fellow Watchers. Dawson uses his access to Watcher resources to assist Duncan on several occasions. Dawson, even came to [[Amanda (Highlander)|Amanda]]'s aid when she asked for his help when she worked with Nick Wolfe; demonstrating that he had a certain affection for her. The Watchers expel Dawson from the organization for a brief period following the revelations about his breaking his Watcher's oath and the subsequent events. At Duncan's insistence, however, Dawson apparently used his contacts in the organization to be able to re-enter it.

Dawson met his untimely demise in ''[[Highlander: The Source]]'', trying to rescue immortal Reggie Weller from the Guardian, who responded by running him through with the shattered blade of Duncan MacLeod's sword.  However, the events of ''The Source'' have been acknowledged by the actors and Series head writer David Abramowitz as having been nothing more than a bad dream, and are not part of the overall continuity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

It is revealed in the 2008 short film ''Highlander: Reunion'', said to take place a decade after the end of Series, that Dawson has begrudgingly been retired from the Watchers, just shy of 40 years of service. Dawson tells his long-time friend and former Watcher [[Methos]] that a new, 28-year-old Watcher has been assigned to Duncan MacLeod. His replacement is a [[Princeton University]] graduate and member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and is not physically handicapped as he is.

== Characterization ==
Byrnes says of his character, "Joe's been through the wringer. (…) It would be hard for people to be around him too much, I think. He's kind of a loner, because at some point he's got to have some serious demons. These people have witnessed this crazy stuff; how do you deal with it ? It's hard to be ordinary. Joe is extra ordinary [sic], he's really ordinary. I mean that in a good way."&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt;

== Character development ==
=== Creation ===
The script of "The Watchers" describes Dawson as a middle-aged or older man called Ian Dawson, saying, "There is a sense of power and mystery behind the man's scholarly appearance."&lt;ref name="TWS7"&gt;Episode "The Watchers", Final Shooting Script, p.7, in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Actor Jim Byrnes precises, "he was either North American or English, somewhere between forty and sixty. (…) Immediately, I said, 'No, I'm not an Ian.' So we changed the name to Joe."&lt;ref name="CWGJB"&gt;Jim Byrnes, in Maureen Russell, ''Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide'', Warner Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-446-67435-4}}, p. 97-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Byrnes was hired on a tight schedule and says, "Originally, I knew I was doing this one episode [''"The Watchers"''] where we were going to introduce the character and then we were going to take it from there. And they promised me ''x'' number more episodes just to kind of sweeten the pot to get me to do the show on short notice."&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt;

According to Executive Producer [[Bill Panzer]] and Creative Consultant David Abramowitz, actors [[Michael York (actor)|Michael York]] and [[David McCallum]] wanted to play the part.&lt;ref name="TWBD"&gt;Episode "The Watchers", Bonus Material, Bill Panzer and David Abramovitz's interview, in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 1.&lt;/ref&gt; They were looked at because initially Joe was meant as a character "more studious, [with a] much tighter personality"&lt;ref name="TWBD" /&gt; than he eventually became. Abramovitz says, "In the beginning with Joe, the Dawson we wrote was a totally different character and it didn't work as well as it could."&lt;ref name="CWGDA" /&gt; Byrnes was finally chosen because, according to Abramowitz, he had "a certain quality that was just more real, more earthly than the other two (…) he had his own trials to live through his life, being handicapped, and he was a wonderful actor, but more than an actor he's got presence on a screen."&lt;ref name="TWBD" /&gt; Abramowitz adds, "He's a human guy, he's a real mensch, Jim. There are no illusions. There is strength but not a tremendous amount of vanity."&lt;ref name="CWGDA" /&gt; Bill Panzer says, "he was a real [[mensch]]."&lt;ref name="TWBD" /&gt;

=== Development ===
Dawson's function as a character is mostly one of exposition. Byrnes says, "So many times, it's the nature of the game, I end up saying, 'Well, you know, in 1865 they found this guy' and just do exposition. You got to tell the story some way. You're like the narrator because of the nature of the show; it's not about me."&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt; Dawson also had to face conflicts of his own. Abramowitz thinks, "Look at the stories that Joe opened up because of the character of Joe and the conflicts that Joe faces. And coming to terms with being somewhat of a hypocrite, which is, 'We observe; we don't act.' And then you see Joe act. Which happens because he is human and because it's a classic case of 'Do what I say, not what I do.' And that's the way life is and that's the way people are. (…) So, those things are always very difficult, and those are the things that he plays with. In "Indiscretions", it is Joe and Methos, and the issue of interference comes to the fore."&lt;ref name="CWGDA" /&gt;

In "The Watchers", Dawson is working in a bookstore the script of the episode describes as "like Book Soup in [[Los Angeles]], cluttered".&lt;ref name="TWS7" /&gt; Later, Dawson moves from the bookstore to the blues bar. Abramowitz explains, "Jim Byrnes as a bookstore owner just doesn't make it for me. The best thing we ever did was, later on, move him into the bar, which is where he lives and where his soul plays."&lt;ref&gt;David Abramowitz, in {{cite web|url=http://www.highlandercatalog.com/s2ep23.shtml |title=The Watchers (Season 2 Episode 23) |accessdate=2008-06-16 |publisher=Davis/Panzer Merchandising Corp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830100542/http://www.highlandercatalog.com/s2ep23.shtml |archivedate=2003-08-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Abramowitz says, "We came up with the idea of the blues bar, which was a perfect place for him and gave us opportunities to hear his music."&lt;ref name="CWGDA" /&gt; Byrnes says, "I wanted to get into a milieu that I enjoyed and that Joe enjoyed, just as the character. And it happened because everybody has discovered that it doesn't just say on my résumé that I'm a professional singer and guitarist. I actually am. Everybody came out to hear the band play and then thought, 'How can we incorporate this into the show ?' And we found a way and it's been great. It really helps you as an actor because it broadens Joe's scope immediately. It gives him a wider palette."&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt; Byrnes thinks, "Music is Joe's form of meditation, where he would go; it's Joe's martial art."&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt; Some of Byrnes's music compositions were used in "Archangel" and "Avatar".&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt; Another song by Byrnes, "Jack of Diamonds", was used in "Run For Your Life". Panzer recollects, "That song was so cool that we lengthened the scene fifty percent, because we wanted to hear more of his music as the whole thing works so wonderfully together." Panzer further adds, "That was the first time he ever sang on the show, and was kind of the trigger that led us to build Joe's place so that we could showcase his blues singing and his playing."&lt;ref&gt;Episode "Run For Your Life", Bonus Material, Bill Panzer and David Abramovitz's interview, in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Creative Consultant Donna Lettow says, "For "The Cross of St. Antoine", we had just built Joe's a couple of episodes before, and a memo had gone out, saying, 'Use Joe's; we love it, it's beautiful, and we spent a lot of money on it.'"&lt;ref name="CWGDL"&gt;Donna Lettow, in Maureen Russell, ''Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide'', Warner Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-446-67435-4}}, p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Lettow further recalls how they arranged a breakaway window for Dawson, who in this episode tries to rescue his girlfriend. The window broke on its way to the set and Byrnes is actually trying to break a tempered window with his cane. Eventually one of the grips painted a crowbar to match Byrnes' cane and Byrnes managed to break the window.&lt;ref name="CWGDL" /&gt; Lettow also recalls, "There's an episode, "Indiscretions", where we find out that Joe has a daughter, Amy Brennan. And in the version that we sent to the set, she never knows. It's an affair Joe had in his Watcher Academy days, and he and the girl's mother decided it was best, as Joe says, 'To ruin one life instead of four.' And [Director] Dennis Berry called after the script went up and said, 'Don't you think a fiery scene between Joe and Amy about it and then Amy gets kidnapped? Now Joe has unfinished business. They've had a fight; he really has to get her back. Wouldn't that be dramatically better?' And indeed, in this case, it was, and we went ahead and made the changes. "Indiscretions" is all about things that Joe and Methos did in their past that have come back to haunt them. (…) Methos has a longer track record, of course. But at the heart, I think they're very similar."&lt;ref name="CWGDL" /&gt;

Dawson has a complicated relationship with Duncan MacLeod. Executive Producer Bill Panzer says about "Turnabout", "this episode was the beginning of the relationship, well the expansion of the relationship between Joe Dawson and Duncan MacLeod. For Joe to help MacLeod by getting him a file, was for him a very big step in what became a major character arc as the two of them grew closer and closer."&lt;ref&gt;Episode "Turnabout", Bonus Material, Bill Panzer's interview, in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Abramowitz thinks of "Unholy Alliance", "It created tension between Joe Dawson and Mac, which was a very good thing, so that Joe just wasn't a sidekick, wasn't a helper, that he had his own agenda, that he had his own view of the world, and it really solidified in some ways what the perspective of the Watchers were."&lt;ref&gt;Episode "Unholy Alliance", Bonus Material, David Abramowitz's interview, in ''Highlander: The Series'' (season 2) (DVD, Davis-Panzer Productions and Gétévé, 2003), disk 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Panzer further says that Dawson "was (…) the first Watcher, that we know of who (…) started step over the line a little bit. There was that separation between the Watchers and the Immortals, and he didn't just observe, didn't just record, but occasionally chose a side, (…) started to help."&lt;ref name="TWBD" /&gt; Abramowitz further observes, "I think that Joe believes that there is something singular and special about Duncan MacLeod, that there may be a destiny MacLeod has to fulfill, which is even greater than the Watchers'. (…) Why in our universe does Joe think Duncan is special ? Because he has seen signs, "Avatar", "Armageddon", "Something Wicked", "Deliverance", "Prophecy", that separate MacLeod from everyone else, that there is a prophecy that MacLeod is the anointed one. We hint at it, and obviously Joe feels this, plus he feels a tremendous admiration for MacLeod. He loves Duncan MacLeod. This is as deep as one man can feel for another. And I think it's returned."&lt;ref name="CWGDA" /&gt;

Tynan thinks of the relationship between Dawson and James Horton, "Horton would not die. Of course, his brother-in-law, Joe Dawson, was the shakiest gun in the West. He seemed to not be able to hit the guy in any part of the body that would actually kill him. Horton kept surviving."&lt;ref&gt;David Tynan, in Maureen Russell, ''Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide'', Warner Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-446-67435-4}}, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reception ===
The audience reaction was favorable. Abramowitz recalls, "he was one of the fans' favorites all over the years that we made the show."&lt;ref name="TWBD" /&gt; He explains, "the audience actually took part, they could identify with the Watchers. (…) It's hard to identify with someone who is Immortal. Sometimes they live for eight hundred or a thousand or five hundred years, but a Watcher's just a normal human being. And so the audience could find themselves thinking, 'I could be that guy'. And I think Joe became every man of the show. He became the audience in a big way."&lt;ref name="TWBD" /&gt; Byrnes says similarly, "I think [the Watchers are] part of the reason that the character caught on. We are all Watchers, everybody that's a fan of the show. We are all members of the same organization, so I think that puts me, an ordinary guy, in extraordinary circumstances, and that gives everybody something to hang on to. I think that's why the character has worked. We all get older and have our aches and pains and we look different every day, you know, a couple extra miles, so it gives that sense of continuity. I just put everybody, all the viewers, I think, a little bit closer to the picture. Because they see me, and some days I don't look so hot and some days I look all right. It's the human element. Joe's just an ordinary person witnessing extraordinary events."&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt; Executive Script Consultant David Tynan says, "I like writing for Jim Byrnes. Joe Dawson is an interesting character because he is human. While MacLeod is human in many ways, he's Immortal. Joe is a human like I am or like you are or anyone else is. So he's very accessible."&lt;ref name="CWGDT" /&gt; Abramowitz thinks, "Jim's soul plays through Joe Dawson."&lt;ref name="CWGDA" /&gt; Byrnes says of his work, "I had a good rapport with the crew, with Adrian [Paul], with the writers, the producers, etcetera. Obviously, I didn't get in the way, and what I did didn't hurt anybody. And people seemed to enjoy the character, so it's continued."&lt;ref name="CWGJB" /&gt;

=== "Brother in Arms" and "Armageddon" ===
In "Brother in Arms" Dawson is seen losing his legs and in "Armageddon"  Dawson is tempted into having his legs again. Executive Script Consultant David Tynan says, "There have been a couple of shows where Jim, the actor, has had to deal with Joe, the character, facing the loss of his legs. ["Brother in Arms"] In the scene where Joe wakes up to find his legs gone, I had to ask Jim what it was like. Jim said, 'Well, the fact is you don't wake up and scream in terror, you wake up and go "Whoa", and fall back to sleep, because you're so shot up with morphine, you have no idea what they're telling you.' So we adjusted the script accordingly. And certainly we were very concerned how Jim would feel, as we would be concerned about how any actor would feel about something that approached his personal life in such a way. And Jim was okay with it. I think that's a tribute to him as an actor and as a person, that he's not afraid to explore those areas. Or they are areas that he has in some part explored and he's not afraid to put on the screen. The temptation scene in "Armageddon" was a very unusual scene. It's hard to watch in some way, probably hard to do."&lt;ref name="CWGDT"&gt;David Tynan, in Maureen Russell, ''Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide'', Warner Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-446-67435-4}}, p. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Abramowitz says, "I loved "Armageddon" because Jim Byrnes gave an incredible performance, which was heartbreaking."&lt;ref name="CWGDA"&gt;David Abramovitz, in Maureen Russell, ''Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide'', Warner Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-446-67435-4}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He says further, "I called him before and I said, 'Jim, how do you feel about this?' Because I would never do anything that would make him uncomfortable as a human being. But he was actually excited to do it. He was really into it, up for it, going for it. He's come to terms with his life and who he is. (…) Joe is pretty much the human factor, but he's the heroic human factor."&lt;ref name="CWGDA" /&gt; Associate Creative Consultant [[Gillian Horvath]] says, "It's big stuff for him. It's issues from his own life, but it's not about him; it's about Joe, but they obviously share some certain traits. That he's willing to bare his own life, his own feelings, in order to give Joe something that strong. That he cares enough about the character to say, 'Yeah, let's give him this big scene and in order to do it I will use myself, part of me will be offered up.'"&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Horvath, in Maureen Russell, ''Highlander: The Complete Watcher's Guide'', Warner Books, 1998, {{ISBN|0-446-67435-4}}, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Lettow recalls that when the producers viewed the dailies of Armageddon, in which [[Ahriman (Highlander)|Ahriman]] looking like James Horton offers his legs to Dawson, there was "not a dry eye in the room. And we watched those over and over and just marveled at Jim Byrnes' ability. And sat here saying, 'Oh my God, what have we done to him?'"&lt;ref name="CWGDL" /&gt;

'''John Bale''' (21 November 1495 – November 1563) was an English churchman, historian and controversialist, and [[Bishop of Ossory]]. He wrote the oldest known historical [[verse drama]] in English (on the subject of [[King John of England|King John]]), and developed and published a very extensive list of the works of British authors down to his own time, just as the monastic libraries were being dispersed. His unhappy disposition and habit of quarrelling earned him the nickname "bilious Bale".

== Outline of his life ==
He was born at [[Cove Hithe|Cove]], near [[Dunwich]] in [[Suffolk]].&lt;ref&gt;The core of this article is taken from the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' of 1911 (see {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bale, John}}). A short biographical outline is in [[Alfred W. Pollard]] (Ed.), ''English Miracle Plays, Moralities and Interludes'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1914), 218-219. See also ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of twelve he joined the [[Carmelite]] [[friars]] at [[Norwich]], removing later to the house of "Holme", (possibly the [[Carmelite]] [[priory]] at [[Hulne]] near [[Alnwick]]). Later he entered [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], and took his degree of B.D. in 1529.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=BL528J|name=Bale, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became the last Prior of the [[Ipswich Whitefriars|Ipswich Carmelite]] house, elected in 1533.&lt;ref&gt;B. Zimmerman, 1899, '[[Ipswich Whitefriars|The White Friars at Ipswich]],' ''Proc. Suffolk Institute of Archaeology'' 10 Part 2, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned his monastic vocation, and got married, saying, "that I might never more serve so execrable a beast, I took to wife the faithful Dorothy." He obtained the living of [[Thorndon, Suffolk]], but in 1534 was summoned before the [[Archbishop of York]] for a sermon against the invocation of saints preached at [[Doncaster]], and afterwards before [[John Stokesley]], [[Bishop of London]], but he escaped through the powerful protection of [[Thomas Cromwell]], whose notice he is said to have attracted by his [[miracle play]]s.

In these plays Bale denounced the monastic system and its supporters in unrestrained language and coarse imagery. The prayer of ''Infidelitas'' which opens the second act of his ''Three Laws'' is an example of his profane parody. These somewhat brutal productions were intended to impress popular feeling, and Cromwell found in him an invaluable instrument. When Cromwell fell from favour in 1540, Bale fled with his wife and children to [[Antwerp]]. He returned on the accession of King [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], and received the living of [[Bishopstoke]], [[Hampshire]], being promoted in 1552 to the Irish see of [[Bishop of Ossory|Ossory]]. He refused to be consecrated by the [[Roman Catholic]] rites of the Irish church, and won his point, though the Dean of [[Dublin]] made a protest against the revised office during the ceremony. He also quarrelled bitterly with the aged and respected judge [[Thomas St. Lawrence]], who travelled to [[Kilkenny]] to urge the people to reject his innovations.

When the accession of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] inaugurated a violent reaction in matters of religion, he was forced to get out of the country again. He tried to escape to Scotland, but on the voyage was captured by a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] man-of-war, which was driven by bad weather into [[St Ives, Cornwall]]. Bale was arrested on suspicion of [[treason]], but soon released. At [[Dover, England|Dover]] he had another narrow escape, but he eventually made his way to the Netherlands and thence to [[Frankfurt]] and [[Basel]]. During his exile he devoted himself to writing. After his return, on the accession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]], he received (1560) a [[prebendal stall]] at [[Canterbury]], where he died and was buried in the cathedral.

== Mysteries, Miracle Plays, ''Kynge Johan'' ==
John Bale attacked his enemies with vehemence and scurrility, much of which was directed strongly and forcibly against the [[Roman Catholic]] Church and its writers: but this cavill does not significantly diminish the value of his contributions to literature. (The Roman Catholic sympathiser and antiquary [[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony Wood]], a man of "uncouth manners" and a condemned libeller, described him as "foul-mouthed Bale" a century afterwards.) Of his mysteries and [[miracle plays]] only five have been preserved, but the titles of the others, quoted by himself in his ''Catalogus'', show that they were animated by the same political and religious aims. The ''Three Laws of [[Nature]], [[Moses]] and Christ, corrupted by the [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodomytes]], [[Pharisees]] and [[Papist|Papystes]] most wicked''&lt;ref&gt;Printed in ''Anglia'', Bd. v.: source cited in Pollard 1914, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; (produced in 1538 and again in 1562) was a [[morality play]]. The direction for the dressing of the parts is instructive: "Let [[Idolatry]] be decked like an old witch, [[Sodomy]] like a monk of all sects, Ambition like a bishop, [[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Covetousness]] like a Pharisee or spiritual lawyer, False Doctrine like a popish doctor, and [[Hypocrisy]] like a gray friar." ''A Tragedye; or enterlude manifesting the chief promyses of God unto Man'',&lt;ref&gt;Printed in [[Robert Dodsley]], ''Select Collection of Old Plays'' (12 vols., 1744; 2nd edition with notes by [[Isaac Reed]], 12 vols., 1780; 4th edition, by [[William Carew Hazlitt]], 1874–1876, 15 vols.), volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Temptacyon of our Lorde'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Balloch Grosart|A. B. Grosart]] (Ed.), 1870, ''Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library'', vol. i.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A brefe Comedy or Enterlude of [[John the Baptist|Johan Baptystes]] preachynge in the Wyldernesse, etc.''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harleian Miscellany]]'' volume i.&lt;/ref&gt; were all written in 1538.

===''Kynge Johan''===
{{main|King Johan}}
Bale is a figure of some literary-dramatic importance as the author of ''Kynge Johan'' (c.1538),&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Collier (Ed.), ''John Bale's "The Tragycall Historie of Kynge Johan"'', ([[Camden Society]], 1838). See a long extract in Pollard 1914, 146-154.&lt;/ref&gt; which marks the transition between the old [[morality play]] and the English [[historical drama]]. It does not appear to have directly influenced the creators of the chronicle histories (such as ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'' (1591)), but it is remarkable that such a developed attempt at historical drama should have been made fourteen years before the production of ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]''. ''Kynge Johan'' is itself a polemic against the Roman Catholic Church. [[John I of England|King John]] is represented as the champion of English church rites against the [[Papal authority|Roman see]].

== Summary of the Writers of Britain ==
Some view Bale's most important work as being ''Illustrium majoris Britanniae scriptorum, hoc est, Angliae, Cambriae, ac Scotiae Summarium...'' ("A Summary of the Famous Writers of Great Britain, that is, of England, Wales and Scotland") published at [[Ipswich]] and [[Wesel]] for John Overton in  1548, and 1549.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dWFUAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false First edition] at Googlebooks.&lt;/ref&gt; This contained authors through five centuries: however, another edition, almost entirely rewritten and containing fourteen centuries, was printed at [[Basel]] with the title ''Scriptorum illustrium majoris Britanniae...Catalogus'' ("Catalogue of the Famous Writers of Great Britain") in 1557–1559.

This chronological catalogue of British authors and their works was partly founded on the ''De uiris illustribus'' of [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]. Bale was an indefatigable collector and worker, and personally examined many of the valuable libraries of the [[Augustinian]] and [[Carmelite]] houses before their [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]]. His work contains much information that would otherwise have been hopelessly lost. His autograph note-book is preserved in the [[John Selden|Selden Collection]] of the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Oxford]]. It contains the materials collected for his two published catalogues arranged alphabetically, without enlargement on them nor the personal remarks which colour the completed work. He includes the sources for his information.&lt;ref&gt;Critical annotated edition: [[Reginald Lane Poole]] and Mary Bateson, ''Index Britanniae Scriptorum quos... collegit Ioannes Baleus'' ([[Clarendon Press]], 1902), ''Anecdota Oxoniensia'', Part IX.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted: "I have bene also at Norwyche, our second citye of name, and there all the library monuments are turned to the use of their grossers, candelmakers, sopesellers, and other worldly occupyers...

[[John Pitts (Catholic scholar)|John Pitts]] or Pitseus (1560–1616), an English [[Roman Catholic]] exile, founded on Bale's work his ''Relationum historicarum de rebus anglicis tomus primus'' (Paris, 1619), better known by its running title of ''De Illustribus Angliae scriptoribus''. This is really the fourth book of a more extensive work. He omits the [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffite]] and [[Protestant]] divines mentioned by Bale, and the most valuable section is the ''lives'' of the Roman Catholic exiles resident in [[Douai]] and other French towns. He asserts (''Nota de Joanne Bale'') that Bale's ''Catalogus'' was a misrepresentation of [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]'s work, though in all likelihood he only knew Leland's work through his reading of Bale.

===The Image of Both Churches===

'''''The Image of Both Churches''''' was published by John Bale in 1547, and is a detailed commentary on the book of Revelation, the last book in the Christian Bible. Bale proceeded by taking short passages and following with a detailed paraphrase to explain the meaning and significance of such things as the opening of the seven seals, the first beast, the second beast with two horns, the blowing of the trumpets, and the going forth of the horsemen. Of central concern was the correct identification of [[Antichrist]].

Bale’s central thesis is that the book of Revelation is a prophecy of how God’s word and those who love it (the “saints”) would fare at the hands of men and a false Church during the last age, meaning the time between the [[ascension of Jesus]] and the end of the world.

Bale identified two types of churches. First there was a false church, or Church of Antichrist, which persecutes those who do not bow to its dictates. He did not entirely limit his criticism to the Roman Church but, typical of the Puritans, accused also the young [[Church of England]]. By contrast, the "true Church" loves and teaches God's word truly. He also speaks critically of the Church of Mohammed (“Mahomet”): its tyranny over the people (the “Turks”) and persecution of the saints.  

==In  popular culture==
He is the central figure in the 1988, novel ''Books of Bale'' by the novelist and playwright [[John Arden]].

The '''Kalkadoon''' (properly '''Kalkatungu''') are descendants of an [[Indigenous Australian]] tribe living in the [[Mount Isa, Queensland|Mount Isa]] region of Queensland. Their forefather tribe has been called 'the elite of the Aboriginal warriors of Queensland'.{{sfn|Lack|1959|p=187}} In 1884 they were massacred at "Battle Mountain" by settlers and police.

==Language==
[[Kalkatungu language|Kalkatung]] belonged to the [[Kalkatungic languages|Kalkatungic branch]] of the [[Pama-Nyungan languages|Pama-Nyungan language family]], the other being [[Yalarnnga language|Yalarnnga]] which was spoken to its south in the area of [[Dajarra, Queensland|Djarra]], in Queensland. Kalkatungu was spoken around Mount Isa, Queensland. Nothing is known of a third language [[Wakabunga language|Wakabunga]] sometimes thought to have had a genetic relation to the other two.

Remnants of the language collected from the last native speakers by Barry Blake allowed the rudiments of the grammar and the language to be reconstructed.{{sfn|Blake|1979}} According to [[Robert M. W. Dixon]] there is a 43% overlap in vocabulary existed with Yalarnnga but with a different grammar and only 10% percent of verbs cognate. Both have bounded pronouns or traces of them unlike all other languages in the surrounding areas suggesting they represented, until their extinction, a larger block of distinctive languages.{{sfn|Dixon|2004|p=670}}

Like many other Aboriginal societies, the Kalkatungu had a [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages|sign language]].{{sfn|Kendon|1988|pp=381–382}} The idea of a large kangaroo, for example, was indicated by joining the tip of the forefinger to the thumb, with all other fingers remaining extended, while flicking the wrist forward (suggestive of the hopping motion). A land snake was indicated by pointing the forefinger, while rotating the wrist and extending one's arm outwards.{{sfn|Roth|1897|p=77}}

==Ecology and material/artistic culture==
The Kalkatungu's traditional lands began at the heads of the Cloncurry river across the heads of the [[Leichhardt River|Leichhardt]] and [[Gregory River]]s, including the [[Barkly Tableland]], the [[Selwyn Range (Australia)|Selwyn ranges]] and extending south to the boundaries around Chatsworth, Mount Merlin and Buckingham Downs. To their east and north, were the [[Mayabic languages|Mayi-Thakurti (Mitakoodi)]] of the Cloncurry district,{{sfn|Roth|1897|p=42}} and next to the [[Mayabic languages|Maigudung]] tribe, according to Palmer.{{sfn|Palmer|1884|p=3}}

[[Walter Roth]] documented in some detail the intensity of indigenous trading passing through the [[Selwyn Range (Australia)|Selwyn Range]] and Kalkatungu lands from Boulia to Cloncurry, which formed a transit point for exchanges everything from the native medical anaesthetic and narcotic stimulant, [[pituri]],{{sfn|Johnston|Cleland|1933|pp=201–223}} and ochre to stone knives and axes.{{sfn|Davidson|2016|pp=124–125}} Over 800,000 stone axe blanks remain strewn over the 2.4 sq.km [[Amphibolite|metabasalt]] quarry at [[Lake Moondarra]] near Mt Isa, attesting to the intensity of aboriginal manufacturing for trade goods in this Kalkatungu area, some of the axes being traded as far away as 1,000&amp;nbsp;kilometres.{{sfn|McNiven|2015|pp=603–630}}

The Kalkatungu were an early transmission group for the diffusion of the ''Mudlunga'' (Molonga) ritual dance from the [[Georgina River]]. A photo exists of their men in full ceremonial raiment, dated 1895, prepared to perform their version of the dance that, within a few decades, would reach across Australia.{{sfn|Davidson|2016|p=125}}{{sfn|Mulvaney|1976|pp=90–92}}

Extensive rock art, with examples of anthropomorphic paintings, has been recorded in the Kalkatungu's Selwyn Range homeland.{{sfn|Davidson|2016|pp=127–128}}

==Social structure==
The nearby Mayi-Thakurti tribe occasionally reported that the Kalkatungu were split into two major divisions, respectively the ''Muntaba'' (southern) and the ''Roongkari''(western) peoples.{{sfn|Roth|1897|p=42}}

==Mythology==
Frederic Urquart who played a part as a trooper in a massacre of Kalkadoon warriors, recounted their myth regarding the origins of fire. It started with a thunderbolt that set the plains on fire, as the tribe were preparing to eat raw meat. The flames swept over the camp site, and the charred meat was found to be tastier. An old woman was sent to track the fire and fetch in back, and brought back a blazing stick. Charged with being the fire-keeper, she loyally watched over it for years, until a flood washed out the camp-fire. She was exiled until she could retrieve the secret of fire and, failing to do so, in rage rubbed two sticks together, and a flame kindled, and she won back entry to the tribe.{{sfn|Urquhart|1885|pp=87–88}}

==History==
The first Europeans to visit the area were explorers [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]] who crossed the [[Cloncurry River]] in 1861.{{sfn|Palmer|1903}} Though their journals make no mention of the tribe, their passing through is said to have been recorded in Kalkatungu oral history,{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=68}} and in their language they coined the term ''walpala'' (from 'white feller') to denote Europeans.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006|p=43}}{{efn|Henry Reynolds p.43, adduces such coinages in native language as evidence that, contrary to many reports regarding coastal peoples, for the aboridgines of the hinterland, such a domesticated foreign terminology suggests the presence of whites there was not considered as representing ancestors, ghosts or spirits}} Three parties sent out to search for Burke and Wills, led respectively by [[John McKinlay]], [[William Landsborough]], and [[Frederick Walker (native police commandant)|Frederick Walker]] passed through the general area, and Walker, former commander of the [[Dawson River (Queensland)|Dawson native police]], shot 12 natives dead, while wounding several more, just to the north east of Kalkatungu territory.{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=68}}

[[Edward Palmer (Australian politician)|Edward Palmer]], described by [[George Phillips (Australian politician)|George Phillips]] as 'one of that brave band of pioneer squatters who in the early sixties swept across North Queensland with their flocks and herds, settling, as if by magic, great tracts of hitherto unoccupied country,'{{sfn|Palmer|1903|p=xi}} settled on the edge of Kalkatungu country in 1864, at [[Canobie Station|Conobie]], on the western bank of the [[Cloncurry River]].{{sfn|Palmer|1903|p=xi}} Decades later, he described them as a peculiar people of which little was known.{{sfn|Palmer|1884|p=3}} Palmer was critical of the use of native police, and interested in indigenous tribes. His station lands did not cover any Kalkatungu sacred sites, he did not object to their presence in the vicinity, and found no problem in his relations with the Kalkatungu.{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=69}} He tried to learn their language.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} [[Ernest Henry (explorer)|Ernest Henry]] arrived in 1866, discovering, with the assistance of Kalkatungu guides, copper deposits the following year,{{sfn|Davidson|2016|p=122}} and founded the Great Australia Mine. He successfully enlisted some Kalkatungu people to work one of these mines.{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=69}} A short attempt at settlement by W. and T. Brown at Bridgewater in 1874 experienced, like Palmer, no difficulties with the indigenous owners of the land.{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=69}}

The Scottish settler Alexander Kennedy then took up land in the area in 1877. He had managed, since his arrival in 1861, to accumulate land holdings of some 4,800 sq-miles, holding 60,000 cattle, and established himself in a residence he built, called ''Buckingham Downs.'' Kennedy is thought to have begun the troubles with the native peoples of the area by instigating murderous assaults on the Kalkatung.{{sfn|Furniss|2006|p=177}}{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=69}} Iain Davidson describes him as 'the man who led the destruction of the tribes of North West Central Queensland.'{{sfn|Davidson|2016|p=127}}

The traditional white heroic narrative version of what then occurred drew on the account provided by [[Hudson Fysh|Sir Wilmot Hudson Fysh]] in 1933. According to this version, the Kalkatungu were by nature a hostile and bellicose tribe, exceptionally brave with 'primitive' military cunning and guerilla-like tactics of strategic withdrawals to the mountains to evade reprisals for their savagery, who were vanquished and broken after a last stand against men like Kennedy who triumphed heroically in pursuing the moral and economic progress of Queensland.{{sfn|Furniss|2006|p=177}}

==The massacre at Battle Hill==
In December 1878, a settler called Molvo, with three of his men, were killed near Cloncurry, at the important Wonomo watering hole{{sfn|Davidson|2016|p=122}} on Suleiman Creek{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=69}} near Cloncurry, as they camped with their herd. This was the starting point, in indigenous history, for Kennedy and other settlers in the district joining forces with native troops under Inspector Eglinton stationed at [[Boulia, Queensland|Boulia]] to war down the native tribes of the region.{{sfn|Davidson|2016|p=122}} Subsequent to this incident, scores of Kalkatungu in the surrounding hills were shot down.{{sfn|Lack|1959|p=187}}{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=69}}

Over the following years, the Kalkatungu gained a reputation among graziers for tactical wiliness both in resisting police and settler forays against them, and in harvesting the cattle game they found on their lands. Kennedy pulled strings in Brisbane to get reinforcements that might guarantee greater immunity for people and property in the area, and the first Queensland [[Commissioner of Police]] [[David Thompson Seymour|D. T. Seymour]] is said to have given Kennedy a blank cheque to war down the tribe and to have dispatched the aristocratic Marcus de la Poer Beresford, a nephew of the [[Marquess of Waterford]], as new head of the Cloncurry [[Australian native police|native police unit]] to that end.

On 24 January 1883, Beresford camped with four of his troopers at {{ill|Fullarton River|de}} in the [[McKinlay, Queensland|McKinlay Range]]. After skirmishing with a group of Kalkatungu, they managed to corral a number, who appeared to give no resistance, into a gully nearby and post a guard over them for the night. Queensland historian Arthur Laurie suggests Beresford's error lay in 'stupidly treat(ing) them like cattle'.{{sfn|Laurie|1958}} It is presumed that they had a stash of arms prepared for the occasion, and rose up, and killed Beresford and 3 of his men. One, though speared in his side, managed to escape and cover the distance, some 20&amp;nbsp;miles, to ''Farleigh'' station the following day.{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=70}} For a year, the Kalkatung managed to hold sway over their tribal lands, as both settlers and the police felt intimidated by their unbeaten territorial ascendancy. According to an anonymous person writing for the [[Queensland Figaro and Punch|''Queensland Figaro'']], nonetheless, sometime towards the end of 1883, the native police 'willfully murdered eight blackfellows and several gins' in the area.{{sfn|Richards|2008|p=37}}

In March 1884,{{sfn|Laurie|1958}} [[Sir Thomas McIlwraith]] sent [[Frederic Urquhart]], a Sussex immigrant, employed in the Queensland Native Mounted Police Force to handle the crisis.{{sfn|Drake|2012|pp=70–71}} The Kalkatungu are said to have directly challenged him to fight, via a messenger called ''Mahoni''. Urquhart, though based in Cloncurry, set up a forward camp 25&amp;nbsp;miles outside of the town, on the {{ill|Corella River|de}}.

Urquhart was galvanized into action in August on hearing from a native boy, ''Jackie'', who came in and reported that his employer James White Powell of Calton Hills, some 60&amp;nbsp;miles west of Cloncurry, at Mistake Creek, had been speared to death.{{sfn|Laurie|1958}} Powell was a partner of Kennedy's, and the latter, together with Urquhart A.F. Mossman from White Hills station buried Powell, with Urqhart composing a poem vowing vengeance:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Grimly the troopers stood around
that newly made forest grave
and to their eyes that fresh heap mound
for vengeance seemed to crave.

And one spoke out in deep stern tones
and raised his hand on high
For every one of these poor bones
a Kalkadoon shall die.{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=171}}{{efn|The article, 'Native Police', citing this poem 'Powell's Revenge', appeared in the ''Queensland Figaro'' 15 November 1884 and continued: 'it is bad enough to know that such a cursed stain on the country exists as a Native Police force; but it is diabolical to have it's unhallowed work chronicled in idiotic rhyme' that 'clothe brutalilty and cowardice with a mantle of glory and heroism'.}}{{sfn|Richards|2008|pp=36–37}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The group responsible was tracked down to a gorge, where they were feasting on the cattle, and most were mowed down.{{sfn|Towner|1962|p=802}} Over the next 9&amp;nbsp;weeks, settlers and Urquhart's police tracked the Kalkadoons relentlessly in a war of retaliation, killing many.{{sfn|Drake|2012|p=171}} In September, a Chinese shepherd from H.Hopkins's ''Granada Station''{{sfn|Towner|1962|p=802}} on the {{ill|Dugald River|de}} was speared to death in the foothills of the Argylla Ranges, and it was rumoured he had been eaten by 'cannibals'. Soon afterwards, an estimated 600 Kalkatungu warriors gathered on a rocky outlook to fend off the parties of well-armed settlers, the local constabulary and native troopers. At one point the attackers under Urquhart tried a flanking movement, which caused the assembled aborigines to charge straight down on them, only to fall in waves under the withering fire of the muskets,{{sfn|Drake|2012|pp=171–172}} called ''makini'' by the Kalkatungu.{{sfn|Reynolds|2006|p=24}} 200 are said to have died in this battle. Urqhart himself was knocked out, and this broke the back of organized resistance at a tribal level, and it was often touted that the Kalkatungu had been wiped out. The estimated numbers they lost over 6&amp;nbsp;years, from 1878 to 1884, in counter-attacking incursions and the exercise of expropriation over their lands, runs to 900.

==Memorial==
In 1984 on the centenary of the massacre a plaque commemorating the Kalkatungu was unveiled by [[Charles Perkins (Aboriginal activist)|Charles Perkins]] and George Thorpe a Kalkatung elder, at the Kajabbi bush pub north of Cloncurry. It reads in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This obelisk is in memorial to the Kalkatungu tribes, who during September 1884 fought one of Australia's historic battles of resistance against a para-military force of European settlers and the Queensland native Mounted Police at a place known today as Battle Mountain - 20klms [sic] south west of [[Kajabbi]].{{sfn|Gibson|Besley|2004|pp=51–53}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Kalkadoon have been commemorated in the name of the [[Kalkadoon grasswren]], a bird with as small territorial range confined to the slopes of the Mt Isa region.{{sfn|Campbell|Woods|Leseberg|2014|p=240}}

'''Kekionga''' (meaning "blackberry bush")&lt;ref&gt;According to J. Dunn, Jr., the name "usually said to mean "blackberry patch," or "blackberry bush," this plant being considered an emblem of antiquity because it sprang up on the sites of old villages. This theory rests on the testimony of Barron, a longtime an old French trader on the Wabash. It is more probable that Kekioqa is a corruption or dialect form of Kiskakon, or Kikakon, which was the original name of the place." J. P. Dunn, &lt;cite&gt;INDIANA: A REDEMPTION FROM SLAVERY&lt;/cite&gt; New York: HOUGHTON, MIFFLIN AND COMPANY, 1888, 48, Note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael McCafferty, an Algonquian and Uto-Aztecan linguist professor at Indiana University, exhaustively examined the etymology of 'Kekionga' and dismissed Dunn's explanation and several others. See the chapter "Trails to Kekionga" in the relevantly titled 'Native American Place Names of Indiana' (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 2008), esp. p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Kiskakon&lt;ref name="Pointsatte"&gt;Charles R. Poinsatte, ''Fort Wayne During the Canal Era 1828-1855,'' Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Bureau, 1969, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kiskakon, meaning "cut tail," was the principal tribe of the [[Odawa people|Odawa]] nation. At a very early time, they had a village on the Maumee River. Poinsatte, pg 23, fn 1&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Pacanne|Pacan's]] Village,&lt;ref&gt;Andrew R. L. Cayton, ''Frontier Indiana'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1996; {{ISBN|0-253-33048-3}}), 86.&lt;/ref&gt; was the capital of the [[Miami tribe]]. It was located at the confluence of the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|Saint Joseph]], [[St. Marys River (Indiana)|Saint Marys]] and [[Maumee River|Maumee river]]s on the western edge of the [[Great Black Swamp]] in present-day [[Indiana]]. Over their respective decades of influence from colonial times to after the [[American Revolution]] and [[Northwest Indian Wars]], the [[France|French]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and Americans all established trading posts and forts at the large village, as it was located on an important portage connecting [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] rivers. The European-American town of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]] started as a settlement around the American [[Fort Wayne  (fort)|Fort Wayne]] stockade after the [[War of 1812]].

== History ==
Long occupied by successive cultures of [[indigenous peoples]], Kekionga was a large village of the [[Miami people]] at the time of European encounter. It became an important trading post for Europeans because it was on the six-mile portage between the [[Maumee River|Maumee]] and the [[Little River (Indiana)|Little]] rivers, which connected [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Wabash River]] and [[Mississippi River]]. Due to the mid-17th century [[French and Iroquois Wars]]  over the fur trade, most traders believed the route was too dangerous.  Following the wars, however, the portage proved to be the shortest route between the French colonies of [[Canada, New France|New France]] (Canada) and [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]].&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;Poinsatte, 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The area was full of wildlife as it had not been densely inhabited for years.&lt;ref&gt;Poinsatte, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Miami at first benefited from trade with the Europeans, who were primarily [[Canadiens]] from Quebec. Under [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes]], the Canadiens established a trading post and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana|fort]], first at the [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph River]], and later at Kekionga. Vincennes and the Miami developed a strong and enduring friendship.&lt;ref name="Vincennes1"&gt;"Vincennes, Sieur de (Jean Baptiste Bissot)," ''The Encyclopedia Americana'' (Danbury, CT: Grolier, 1990), 28:130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kekionga remained a central site for the Miami for several decades; their other villages were more temporary. The large meeting house hosted official tribal councils. However, a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]] struck Kekionga in 1733 and people evacuated the village for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, 66&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the [[Treaty of Greenville]] (1795), [[Little Turtle]] called Kekionga "that glorious gate ... through which all the good words of our chiefs had to pass from the north to the south, and from the east to the west."&lt;ref name="P1" /&gt; 
 
=== Colonial period ===
British merchants, seeking to expand their economic base, convinced some Miami to travel East for trade, in violation of the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. In 1749, the pro-British [[La Demoiselle]] left Kekionga to establish the English trading village of [[Pickawillany]], which grew rapidly. Fighting between pro-French and pro-British villages broke out among the Miami in 1751, as tensions rose in the region. French officials tried to persuade the Miami to return to Kekionga, which was nearer their stronghold of [[Detroit]] and harder for the British to reach. Lieutenant Louis Coulon de Villiers was sent to the dilapidated Fort Miamis and given authority to commandeer French [[Coureur des bois|voyageurs]] to construct a new fort, which was finished in 1752.&lt;ref&gt;Barnhart, 100-111&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the pro-French chief [[Cold Foot (Miami)|Cold Foot]] died at Kekionga in another smallpox epidemic. When the French-allied [[Three Fires Confederacy]] destroyed Pickawillany, most of the surviving Miami returned to Kekionga, which stopped assisting the French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gbl.indiana.edu/archives/dockett_317a/317a_3f.html Wheeler-Voegelin, Pg 73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315061856/http://www.gbl.indiana.edu/archives/dockett_317a/317a_3f.html |date=2008-03-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French and Indian War]] (1756-1763) ended with the French defeated, France ceded Canada to the British Empire. The Miami of Kekionga became involved in [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in the spring of 1763, capturing the British garrison and killing the two ranking officers. The following year, [[Pacanne]] emerged as the village chief when he spared the life of the captive Captain [[Thomas Morris (British Army officer)|Thomas Morris]] and returned him to Detroit. By 1765, Kekionga had accepted the British. Deputy commissioner [[George Croghan]] described Kekionga:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Twightwee Village is situated on both Sides of a River called St. Joseph's ... The Indian Village Consists of about 40 or 50 Cabins besides nine or ten French Houses.&lt;ref&gt;Rafert, 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== As part of the Northwest Territory ===
In 1780 during the [[American Revolutionary War]], Kekionga was sacked by a force of French Americans led by Colonel [[Augustin de la Balme]], who planned to take Detroit from the British. A Miami force led by Chief [[Little Turtle]] destroyed the French force. The Miami and the European-American traders of Kekionga remained economically tied to the British-held [[Fort Detroit]], even after the British ceded all claims of the [[Northwest Territory]] to the new United States following the war in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]].

In 1790, the Canadian Governor [[Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester|Guy Carleton]] warned the government in London that the loss of Kekionga would result in grave economic hardships to Detroit. He estimated that Kekionga annually produced 2000 packs of pelts, worth about £24,000 sterling. This was twice the value of the next most important trade area, between Detroit and Lake Huron.&lt;ref&gt;Poinsatte, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

During the winter of 1789/1790, the traders Henry Hay and [[John Kinzie]] stayed in Kekionga.  Hay kept a daily journal, which recorded their regular routines of drinking, dancing, and parties, as well as weekly [[Mass]]. Hay played the flute and Kinzie played the fiddle, which made them popular with the inhabitants of Kekionga. Although Hay and Kinzie stayed primarily in the French-speaking village in Kekionga, they also described some of the Miami villages. They frequently talked with the chiefs [[Pacanne]], Little Turtle, [[Blue Jacket]], and [[Le Gris]], as well as brothers James, George, and [[Simon Girty]], who lived only three miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Poinsatte, 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Kekionga.jpg|thumb|Map of Kekionga]]
Later that year during the [[Northwest Indian Wars]], the United States General [[Josiah Harmar]] led an [[Harmar Campaign|invasion]] of Kekionga. His army counted seven distinct villages in the vicinity of Kekionga, known collectively as "the Miami Towns" or '''Miamitown'''.&lt;ref&gt;Poinsatte, 14&lt;/ref&gt; The collected villages of Kekionga had advance knowledge of the army, and most of the people evacuated the area, carrying as many of their food stores as possible.  The traders took their trade goods to Fort Detroit, after giving out all their arms and ammunition to the Miami defenders.&lt;ref name="P22"&gt;Poinsatte, 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Major [[Ebenezer Denny]], an officer with the US, drew a map of Kekionga in 1790, which showed a collection of eight distinct villages, surrounded by 500 acres of cornfields.&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Denny |first=Ebenezer |title=Military Journal of Major Ebenezer Denny, an Officer in the Revolutionary and Indian Wars |year=1859 |publisher=J.B. Lippincott &amp; Co |location=Philadelphia |url=http://deila.dickinson.edu/theirownwords/title/0043.htm |accessdate=11 December 2011}}See map, between pages 146 and 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States army burned some villages and food stores, but was forced to retreat after suffering high casualties in a series of battles with forces led by [[Little Turtle]].

The Miami victories over General Harmar's army encouraged anti-U.S. sentiment in Kekionga, and Secretary of War [[Henry Knox]] decided that a United States fort needed to be built in the area.  He ordered the territorial Governor [[Arthur St. Clair]]- who had recommended such a fort to Knox in 1790- to attack Kekionga and maintain a presence in the area.  That campaign was intercepted long before they reached their destination in what became the Native Americans' [[St. Clair's Defeat|greatest victory]] over United States forces.&lt;ref name="P22" /&gt;

In 1794, the American General [[Anthony Wayne]] led his well-trained [[Legion of the United States]] toward Kekionga, but turned and marched toward the British-held [[Fort Miami (Ohio)|Fort Miami]] near modern-day [[Toledo, Ohio]].  Following General Wayne's victory at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]], Kekionga's prominence began to diminish among the Miami.  The Legion arrived at Kekionga on 17 September 1794, and Wayne personally selected the site for the new [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana|U.S. fort]], which was named for him.&lt;ref&gt;Poinsatte, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  It was finished by 17 October, and was capable of withstanding 24-pound cannons.&lt;ref&gt;Poinsatte, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite their objections, the Miami lost control of the long portage by the [[Treaty of Greenville]] (1795), since the  [[Northwest Ordinance]] passed by Congress guaranteed free use of important portages in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Poinsatte, 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
[[File:Seal of the City of Fort Wayne, Indiana.png|thumb|right|Seal of Fort Wayne]]

After the construction of Fort Wayne, Kekionga's importance to the Miami slowly declined.  The Miami village at the [[The Forks Of The Wabash|Forks of the Wabash]] (modern [[Huntington, Indiana]]) became more prominent.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the strong U.S. presence and loss of portage revenue, however, the Miami maintained sovereignty in Kekionga through the [[Indiana in the War of 1812|War of 1812]].  Under the [[Treaty of Ghent]] in 1814, they were forced to cede this and other central Indiana land in punishment for their not having supported the United States in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Birzer&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was redeveloped as the city of [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].

The old name was used for one of the first professional [[baseball]] teams, the [[Fort Wayne Kekiongas]]. It also appears on Fort Wayne's city seal.

'''Lucius Cassius Hemina''', [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[annalist]], composed his annals in the period between the death of [[Terence]] and the revolution of the [[Gracchi]].  

He wrote in [[Latin]] up to 146 BC, including the earliest account concerning the bravery of [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]. Hemina also discusses the arrival in Rome of the Greek physician Archagathus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fragments of the Roman Historians: Introduction.

The fragments of his works have been edited by Peter in ''Historicorum Romanorum Fragmenta'', and more recently in a separate edition with commentary by Carlo Santini in ''I Frammenti di L. Cassio Emina: Introduzione, Testo, Traduzione e Commento'' (Testi e Studi di Cultura Classica, 13), Pisa: Edizioni ETS, 1995, {{ISBN|88-7741-850-8}}.

'''Léon Heuzey''' (1 December 1831, [[Rouen]] – 8 February 1922, Paris) was a noted French archaeologist and historian.

==Life and career==
In 1855 Heuzey went to Greece as a member of the [[École française d'Athènes]], and for the next two years traveled extensively in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Akarnania]]. The record he kept of his journey, "Le Mont Olympe et l'Acarnanie", was published in Paris in 1860. On this expedition he realised the importance of the site of present-day [[Vergina]]. He began excavations there in 1861, later extending his archaeological ventures to [[Philippi]], western [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Illyria]] and [[Thessaly]].

He discovered many sites of considerable importance. In 1855 and 1861 he explored [[Dion, Greece|Dion]], located at the foot of [[Mount Olympus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KXZMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Heuzey++Dion+1855+1861&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OVNeaJYC67&amp;sig=If3gMYFhFsRwp4rikZS4S_SOGqc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi59Zqw5ofKAhWD6SYKHbzMAQ0Q6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Heuzey%20%20Dion%201855%201861&amp;f=false Ancient Economies of the Northern Aegean: Fifth to First Centuries BC] by Zosia Halina Archibald&lt;/ref&gt; Near by Dion he detected the place where ancient [[Leivithra]] is located. In Thessaly, he found the [[The Exaltation of the Flower|stele of Pharsalos]].&lt;ref&gt;Musée du Louvre.. (1989). ''The Louvre, 7 Faces of a Museum''. Paris : Ministère de la culture et de la communication, Editions de la Réunion des musée. {{ISBN|271182005X}}. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893 he discovered the site of [[Delphi]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} which led to its excavation and appreciation of its significance.

He was also an expert on historic costumes of the Ancient Greek, Byzantine, Egyptian and Roman eras and author of ''Histoire du costume antique d'après des études sur le modèle vivant''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Histoire_du_costume_antique_d_apr%C3%A8s_des.html?id=f1nQAAAAMAAJ Histoire du costume antique d'après des études sur le modèle vivant] Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; Another one of his books is ''Mythes chaldéens''.

==Life==
Marceli Handelsman was born on 8 July 1882, in [[Warsaw]], to a family of distant Jewish ancestry. After graduating in law at the Russian-language [[Warsaw University|Imperial Warsaw University]], he moved to [[Berlin]], where he began studies in the history department of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Unter den Linden University]]. In 1906, however, he was dismissed from the school because of his involvement in [[socialism|socialist]] organizations. Afterwards Handelsman continued his studies at various European universities including [[Paris]], [[Zürich]] (where he received his [[doctorate]] in 1908), [[Rapperswil]], [[Vienna]] and finally [[London]].

During [[World War I]], in 1915, he returned to [[Warsaw]] and joined [[Warsaw University]] as a professor of [[modern history]]. He was also appointed a member of the [[Polish Academy of Learning]]. One of the most prominent historians of the age, between 1918 and 1939 he was also the editor-in-chief of the ''Historical Review'' and the head of a Commission for the Atlas of History of Polish Lands (1920–35).  He was also a member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in [[Paris]] and the [[London]]-based [[Royal Society]].

Initially a medievalist, in the [[Interbellum]] Handelsman devoted much study to 19th-century Polish political history, including the works of Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]] and the [[Hôtel Lambert]] circle.

After the outbreak of [[World War II]] Marceli Handelsman hid from the Germans because of his [[Jew]]ish roots. Nevertheless, he took an active part in [[underground education in Poland during World War II]] and served as a professor in the underground Warsaw University. After 1942, under the ''[[nom de guerre|noms de guerre]]'' "Maciej Romański" and "Maciej Targowski," he worked with the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Headquarters of the [[Home Army]].

{{morefootnotes|date=April 2018}}
The '''Mierzanowice culture''' appeared in the area of the upper and middle basin of the Vistula, during the Early Bronze Age. It evolved from the so-called Protomierzanowice cultural unit.  The name of the culture comes from an eponymous site in [[Mierzanowice]], where the cemetery was located. This entity was part of the precarpathian sphere epicorded cultures and it has been divided into three local groups: samborzecka, iwanowicka and pleszowska.&lt;ref name="lce.lublin.pl"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lce.lublin.pl/archeo/eneolit/eneo_2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115215143/http://www.lce.lublin.pl/archeo/eneolit/eneo_2.html |title=Kultura mierzanowicka |archivedate=15 January 2012 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial phases of functioning of the mentioned culture are characterized by a small number of burials, seasonal settlements and single artifacts. The area of the Mierzanowice culture spread over from western Slovakia, through south - eastern Poland, reaching in the east the areas of the Volhynian Upland.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 142"&gt;Kaczanowski and Kozłowski, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
Based on relative dating, Mierzanowice culture appeared in the Early Bronze Age. According to the archaeologist Jan Machnik, we distinguish the older and younger phase of this cultural unit. The discovery in Szarbia Zwierzyniecka allowed for a certain "rejuvenation" of the Mierzanowice culture as a result of the distinction of its late phase called ''szarbiańska''.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 142"/&gt; The younger phase of the Mierzanowice culture was expended at the end of bronze A1 and the beginning of bronze A2 according to Paul Reinecke chronology. 

== Burial ==
Cemeteries of the Mierzanowice cultural population were established near the settlements. The largest cemeteries were from 150 to 300 burials.&lt;ref name="lce.lublin.pl"/&gt; The burial occurred mainly in skeletal form. Human remains were put into oval or rectangular burial pits or in coffins made of wooden logs. There were two systems for arranging human corpses: in the shrunken position and in straight position. The bodies of men were buried on the right side while corpses of women on the left side. The results of investigations conducted at the cemeteries of the Mierzanowice culture, showed a little advantage of men's graves over women's graves,&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 144"/&gt; which had slightly poorer grave inventory. 




== Settlement ==
Settlements of the Mierzanowice culture in most cases are represented by small and seasonal camps. Settlements with a larger area were founded on the hills with a naturally defensive character, near water reservoirs. A relatively large part of the archaeological sites of this culture are found on loess uplands. The best – known settlement of the Mierzanowice culture is archaeological site called Iwanowice. In the classical phase of the Mierzanowice culture, the settlements were mostly accompanied by cemeteries. 

== Artifacts ==
One of the most common objects discovered in archaeological sites in the Mierzanowice culture are axes and sickles.&lt;ref name="kaczanowski 144"&gt;Kaczanowski and Kozłowski, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of artifacts are neklaces made of faience and bones. The Mierzanowice culture is well known for its earrings in the shape of a willow leaf, often produced in local workshops. Military objects discovered in the settlements are primarily arrowheads on the shape of leaves. The faience beads are an extremely common element of the funeral inventory. The next category is pottery. In vascular ceramics the influences of the Corded Ware culture are visible. Pottery of the late phase of Mierzanowice culture is characterized by a huge variety of forms and ornamentation

"Lew" Rockwell, Jr.]] and [[Burton Blumert]] in 1982 to establish the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] in [[Alabama]].

==Life and work==
===Education===
Rothbard's parents were David and Rae Rothbard, Jewish immigrants to the United States from Poland and Russia, respectively. David Rothbard was a chemist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/etexts/hhhonmnr.asp |title=Murray N.

Holcombe.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray attended [[Birch Wathen Lenox School|Birch Wathen]], a private school in New York City.&lt;ref name="Raimondo2000-34"&gt;{{cite book|last=Raimondo|first=Justin|title=An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N.

Rothbard wrote of having grown up as a "right-winger" (adherent of the "[[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]]") among friends and neighbors who were "communists or fellow-travelers". Rothbard characterized his immigrant father as an individualist who embraced the American values of minimal government, free enterprise, private property and "a determination to rise by one's own merits [...] "[A]ll socialism seemed to me monstrously coercive and abhorrent".&lt;ref name=OldRight/&gt;

[[File:Murray Rothbard.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rothbard in the mid-1950s]]
He attended [[Columbia University]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in mathematics in 1945 and eleven years later his [[PhD]] in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was due in part to conflict with his advisor Joseph Dorfman and in part to [[Arthur Burns]] rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's [[Council of Economic Advisors]] that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate.&lt;ref name="Enemy"/&gt;{{rp|pages=43–44}}&lt;ref name=French&gt;French, Doug (December 27, 2010) [https://mises.org/daily/4919/Burns-Diary-Exposes-the-Myth-of-Fed-Independence Burns Diary Exposes the Myth of Fed Independence], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and that he was one of only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.&lt;ref name="Enemy"/&gt;{{rp|page=4}}

During the 1940s, Rothbard became acquainted with [[Frank Chodorov]] and read widely in libertarian-oriented works by [[Albert Jay Nock]], [[Garet Garrett]], [[Isabel Paterson]], [[H. L. Mencken]] and others as well as [[Austrian School|Austrian economist]] [[Ludwig von Mises]].&lt;ref name="Enemy"/&gt;{{rp|page=46}} In the early 1950s, when Mises was teaching at the [[New York University Stern School of Business|Wall Street division]] of [[New York University]] [[Business School]], Rothbard attended Mises' unofficial seminar. Rothbard was greatly influenced by Mises' book, ''[[Human Action]]''. Rothbard attracted the attention of the [[William Volker Fund]], a group that provided financial backing to promote various right-wing ideologies in the 1950s and early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon, (editor), ''Strictly Confidential: The Private Volker Fund Memos of Murray N. Rothbard'', 2010; [https://mises.org/document/5777/Strictly-Confidential-The-Private-Volker-Fund-Memos-of-Murray-N-Rothbard Full text reprint] Quote from Rothbard: "The Volker Fund concept was to find and grant research funds to hosts of libertarian and right-wing scholars and to draw these scholars together via seminars, conferences, etc."&lt;/ref&gt; The Volker Fund paid Rothbard to write a textbook to explain ''Human Action'' in a form which could be used to introduce college undergraduates to Mises' views; a sample chapter he wrote on money and credit won Mises's approval. For ten years, Rothbard was paid a retainer by the Volker Fund, which designated him a "senior analyst".&lt;ref name="Enemy"/&gt;{{rp|page=54}} As Rothbard continued his work, he enlarged the project. The result was Rothbard's book ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'', published in 1962. Upon its publication, Mises praised Rothbard's work effusively.&lt;ref name="Essential"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordon |first=David |authorlink=David Gordon (philosopher) |title=The Essential Rothbard |publisher=[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] |location=Auburn, Alabama |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-933550-10-7 |oclc=123960448 |url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/David%20Gordon/The%20Essential%20Rothbard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=14}}

===Marriage, employment, and activism===
In 1953, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928–99) – whom he called Joey – in New York City.&lt;ref name="Essential" /&gt;{{rp |page=124}} JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser as well as hostess of his Rothbard Salon. They enjoyed a loving marriage and Rothbard often called her "the indispensable framework" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Sublett, "Libertarians' Storied Guru," ''Washington Times'', July 30, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; The Volker Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966 at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors and Rothbard derided its social science department as "Marxist". However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics.&lt;ref name= "Enemy"/&gt;

Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years until 1986.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klein&gt;Peter G. Klein, Editor, F. A.

Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman.&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, Llewellyn H (May 31, 2007).

[[File:Murray&amp;Joey.jpg|left|thumb|Rothbard with his wife Joey]]
After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit, saying that "he managed to make a living for 40&amp;nbsp;years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him".  She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague [[Lew Rockwell]]: "Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other.

===Conflict with Ayn Rand===
In 1954, Rothbard, along with several other attendees of Mises' seminar, joined the circle of novelist [[Ayn Rand]], the founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. He soon parted from her, writing among other things that her ideas were not as original as she proclaimed, but similar to those of [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name="Enemy" /&gt;{{rp|pages=109–14}} In 1958, after the publication of Rand's novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', Rothbard wrote a "[[Fan mail|fan letter]]" to her, calling the book "an infinite treasure house" and "not merely the greatest novel ever written, [but] one of the very greatest books ever written, fiction or nonfiction". He also wrote: "[Y]ou introduced me to the whole field of natural rights and natural law philosophy", prompting him to learn "the glorious natural rights tradition".&lt;ref name="Enemy" /&gt;{{rp|pages=121, 132–34}}&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;{{cite book|last=Burns|first=Jennifer|title=[[Goddess of the Market|Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]]|year=2009|publisher=Oxford Univ.

Later, Rothbard satirized Rand's [[acolyte]]s in his unpublished [[one-act play]] ''Mozart Was a Red''&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]],

===Austrian economics===
Rothbard was an advocate and practitioner of the [[Austrian School]] tradition of his teacher [[Ludwig von Mises]]. Like Mises, Rothbard rejected the application of the scientific method to economics and dismissed econometrics, empirical and statistical analysis and other tools of mainstream social science as useless for the study of economics.&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1976). [https://mises.org/rothbard/praxeology.pdf ''Praxeology:  The Methodology of Austrian Economics'']. Mises.org&lt;/ref&gt; He instead embraced [[praxeology]], the strictly ''a priori'' methodology of Mises. Praxeology conceives of economic laws as akin to geometric or mathematical axioms: fixed, unchanging, objective and discernible through logical reasoning without the use of any evidence.&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; On the account of Misesian economist [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]], eschewing the scientific method and empirical evidence distinguishes the Misesian approach "from all other current economic schools". [[Mark Skousen]] of [[Grantham University]] and the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], a critic of mainstream economics,&lt;ref name="mises"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/media/2938/Where-Modern-Economics-Went-Wrong|website=mises.org|title=Where Modern Economics Went Wrong|accessdate=August 28, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916033639/http://mises.org/media/2938/Where-Modern-Economics-Went-Wrong|archive-date=September 16, 2014|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; praises Rothbard as brilliant, his writing style persuasive, his economic arguments nuanced and logically rigorous and his Misesian methodology sound.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Mark Skousen. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6sisXMv_AecC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA390#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Making of Modern Economics]'' (M. E. Sharpe, 2009, p. 390). Skousen writes that Rothbard "refused to write for the academic journals."&lt;/ref&gt; However, citing Rothbard's absence of academic publications, Skousen concedes that Rothbard was effectively "outside the discipline" of mainstream economics and that his work "fell on deaf ears" outside his ideological circles. Paralleling Skousen's remarks, Hoppe laments the fact that all non-Misesian economists dismiss as "dogmatic and unscientific" the Misesian approach, which both he and Rothbard embraced.

Rothbard wrote extensively on [[Austrian business cycle theory]] and as part of this approach strongly opposed [[central banking]], [[fiat money]] and [[fractional-reserve banking]] and advocated a [[gold standard]] and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.&lt;ref name="Mystery" /&gt;{{rp|pages=89–94, 96–97}}&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="golddollar"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/1829 |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |title=The Case for a 100 Percent Gold Dollar |year=1991 |origyear=1962 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/north/north769.html |title=What Is Money?

====Polemics against mainstream economics====
Rothbard authored a series of scathing polemics against modern mainstream economics. He was critical of [[Adam Smith]], calling him a "shameless plagiarist" who set economics off-track, ultimately leading to the rise of [[Marxism]]. Instead, Rothbard praised Smith's contemporaries' works, including [[Richard Cantillon]], [[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot]] and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] for developing the [[subjective theory of value]]. In response to Rothbard's charge that Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' was largely plagiarized, [[David D. Friedman]] castigated Rothbard's scholarship and character, saying that he "was [either] deliberately dishonest or never really read the book he was criticizing".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerard Casey (philosopher)|Casey, Gerard]] (2010). ''Murray Rothbard''. New York, NY: The Continuum International Publishing Group. p. 112. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-4209-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tony Endres called Rothbard's treatment of Adam Smith a "travesty".&lt;ref&gt;Tony Endres, review of ''Classical Economics: An Austrian Perspective'', History of Economics Review, http://www.hetsa.org.au/pdf-back/23-RA-7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard was equally scathing in his criticism of [[John Maynard Keynes]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/resources/5223/Keynes-the-Man Keynes the Man], originally published in ''Dissent on Keynes: A Critical Appraisal of Keynesian Economics'', Edited by Mark Skousen. New York: Praeger, 1992, pp. 171–98; Online edition at The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; labeling Keynes weak on economic theory and a shallow political opportunist. Rothbard also wrote more generally that Keynesian-style governmental regulation of [[money]] and credit created a "dismal monetary and banking situation". He demeaned [[John Stuart Mill]] as a "wooly man of mush" and speculated that Mill's "soft" personality led his economic thought astray.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, David (1999). [https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=151&amp;sortorder=issue "John Stuart Mill on Liberty and Control."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914004452/https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=151&amp;sortorder=issue |date=September 14, 2014 }} The Mises Review&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard was critical of monetarist economist [[Milton Friedman]]. In a polemic entitled "Milton Friedman Unraveled", he maligned Friedman as a "statist", a "favorite of the establishment", a friend of and "apologist" for [[Richard Nixon]] and a "pernicious influence" on public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ruger, William (2013). Meadowcroft, John, ed. Milton Friedman. Major Conservative and Libertarian Thinkers. New York, NY: Bloomsbury. p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1971). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard43.html "Milton Friedman Unraveled."] LewRockwell.com&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard said that libertarians should scorn rather than celebrate Friedman's academic prestige and political influence. Noting that Rothbard has "been nasty to me and my work", Friedman responded to Rothbard's criticism by calling him a "cult builder and a dogmatist".&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Brian (1995). [http://reason.com/archives/1995/06/01/best-of-both-worlds/3 "Best of Both Worlds."] ''Reason''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a memorial volume published by the Mises Institute, Rothbard's protégé and libertarian theorist [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] wrote that the work ''[[Man, Economy, and State]]'' "presented a blistering refutation of all variants of mathematical economics" and included it among Rothbard's "almost mind-boggling achievements". Hoppe lamented that like his own mentor Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard died without winning the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] that Hoppe says Rothbard deserved "twice over". Though Hoppe acknowledged that Rothbard and his work were largely ignored by academia, he called Rothbard an "intellectual giant" comparable to [[Aristotle]], [[John Locke]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="Murray Memoriam"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn|title=Murray N. Rothbard In Memoriam|year=1995|publisher=Mises Institute|location=Auburn, Alabama|pages=33–37|url=http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/memoriam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reception of Rothbard's work====
Though he self-identified as an Austrian economist, Rothbard's methodology was at odds with many other Austrians. In 1956, Rothbard deprecated the views of Austrian economist [[Fritz Machlup]], stating that Machlup was no praxeologist and calling him instead a "positivist" who failed to represent the views of Ludwig von Mises. Rothbard stated that in fact Machlup shared the opposing positivist view associated with economist [[Milton Friedman]].&lt;ref&gt;In Defense of "Extreme Apriorism" Murray N. Rothbard Southern Economic Journal, January 1957, pp. 314–20&lt;/ref&gt; Mises and Machlup had been colleagues in 1920s Vienna before each relocated to the United States and Mises later urged his American protege [[Israel Kirzner]] to pursue his PhD studies with Machlup at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kirzner|first=Israel|title=Interview of Israel Kirzner|url=https://www.mises.org/journals/aen/aen17_1_1.asp|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to libertarian economists Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink,&lt;ref name=ERE&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler Cowen and Richard Fink|title=Inconsistent Equilibrium Constructs: The Evenly Rotating Equilibrium Economy of Mises and Rothbard|journal=American Economic Review|year=1985|page=866|jstor=1821365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard wrote that the term evenly rotating economy (ERE) can be used to analyze complexity in a world of change. The words ERE had been introduced by Mises as an alternative nomenclature for the mainstream economic method of [[static equilibrium]] and [[general equilibrium]] analysis. Cowen and Fink found "serious inconsistencies in both the nature of the ERE and its suggested uses". With the sole exception of Rothbard, no other economist adopted Mises' term and the concept continued to be called "equilibrium analysis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunning|first=Patrick|title=Mises on the Evenly Rotating Economy|journal=Journal of Austrian Economics|volume=3|issue=3|url=https://mises.org/periodical.aspx?Id=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 article critical of Rothbard's "reflexive opposition" to inflation, ''[[The Economist]]'' noted that his views are increasingly gaining influence among politicians and laypeople on the right. The article contrasted Rothbard's categorical rejection of inflationary policies with the monetary views of "sophisticated Austrian-school monetary economists such as [[George Selgin]] and Larry White, [who] follow Hayek in treating stability of nominal spending as a monetary ideal—a position not all that different from [[Scott Sumner|Mr Sumner]]'s".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/07/free-marketeers-and-inflation "free marketeers and inflation."] ''The Economist''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economist Peter Boettke, Rothbard is better described as a property rights economist than as an Austrian economist. In 1988, Boettke noted that Rothbard "vehemently attacked all of the books of the younger Austrians".&lt;ref name="Boettke Nomos"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boettke|first=Peter|title=Economists and Liberty: Murray N. Rothbard|journal=Nomos|year=1988|pages=29ff.|url=https://www.academia.edu/2800511/Economists_and_Liberty_Murray_N._Rothbard|accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Although Rothbard adopted Ludwig von Mises' [[deductive]] methodology for his social theory and economics,&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, Curtis M.; Hunn, Lee; Smith, Ken G. ''Strategy as Action: Competitive Dynamics and Competitive Advantage''. New York: Oxford University Press. 2006. p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; he parted with Mises on the question of ethics. Specifically, he rejected Mises conviction that ethical values remain subjective and opposed [[utilitarianism]] in favor of principle-based, [[natural law]] reasoning. In defense of his free market views, Mises employed utilitarian economic arguments aimed at demonstrating that interventionist policies made all of society worse off. On the other hand, Rothbard concluded that interventionist policies do in fact benefit some people, including certain government employees and beneficiaries of social programs. Therefore, unlike Mises, Rothbard attempted to assert an objective, natural law basis for the free market.&lt;ref name="Essential" /&gt;{{rp|pages=87–89}} He called this principle "[[self-ownership]]", loosely basing the idea on the writings of [[John Locke]]&lt;ref&gt;Olsaretti, Serena. 2004. ''Liberty, Desert and the Market''. Cambridge University Press. p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and also borrowing concepts from [[classical liberalism]] and the anti-imperialism of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]].&lt;ref name="Enemy"/&gt;{{rp|page=134}}

Rothbard accepted the [[labor theory of property]], but rejected the [[Lockean proviso]], arguing that if an individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by trade or gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1536-7150.2004.00298.x|title=31 Reckoning with Rothbard|year=2004|last1=Kyriazi|first1=Harold|journal=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|volume=63|issue=2|pages=451–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Regarding pronoun usage in this sentence, what pronouns did Harold Kyriazi use?--&gt;

Rothbard was a strong critic of [[egalitarianism]]. The title essay of Rothbard's 1974 book ''[[Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays]]'' held: "Equality is not in the natural order of things, and the crusade to make everyone equal in every respect (except before the law) is certain to have disastrous consequences".&lt;ref&gt;George C. Leef, [http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/egalitarianism-as-a-revolt-against-nature-and-other-essays-by-murray-rothbard-edited-by-david-gordon#axzz2i8c6D5oO "Book Review of ''Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays'' by Murray Rothbard", edited by David Gordon (2000 edition)], ''[[The Freeman]]'', July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Rothbard wrote: "At the heart of the egalitarian left is the pathological belief that there is no structure of reality; that all the world is a tabula rasa that can be changed at any moment in any desired direction by the mere exercise of human will".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (2003).

===Anarcho-capitalism===
Various theorists have espoused legal philosophies similar to "[[anarcho-capitalism]]". However, Rothbard was the first person to use the term as in the mid-20th century he synthesized elements from the Austrian School of economics, [[classical liberalism]] and 19th-century American [[individualist anarchist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', 1987, {{ISBN|978-0-631-17944-3}}, p. 290; quote: "A student and disciple of the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard combined the laissez-faire economics of his teacher with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Lew Rockwell]], Rothbard is the "conscience" of all the various strains of libertarian anarchism, whose contemporary advocates are former "colleagues" of Rothbard personally inspired by his example.&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, Llewellyn (1995).  [http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/memoriam.pdf "Murray N. Rothbard: In Memoriam."] p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

During his years at graduate school in the late 1940s, Rothbard considered whether a strict ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policy would require that private police agencies replace government protective services. He visited [[Baldy Harper]], a founder of the [[Foundation for Economic Education]],&lt;ref name="The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism by Hamowy"&gt;{{cite book | editor = [[Ronald Hamowy]] |title=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism|year=Aug 15, 2008|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-6580-4|page=623|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC&amp;dq=libertarian+encyclopedia}}{{Cite news | last = Rothbard | first = Murray N | title = Floyd Arthur 'Baldy' Harper, RIP | work = Mises Daily | date = August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who doubted the need for any government whatsoever. During this period, Rothbard was influenced by 19th-century [[American individualist anarchists]] like [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Benjamin Tucker]] and the Belgian economist [[Gustave de Molinari]] who wrote about how such a system could work.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;{{rp|pages=12–13}} Thus, he "combined the ''laissez-faire'' economics of Mises with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state" from individualist anarchists.&lt;ref name=Miller /&gt; In an unpublished memo written around 1949, Rothbard concluded that in order to believe in ''laissez-faire'' one must also embrace anarchism.&lt;ref name="Essential"/&gt;{{rp|pages=12–13}}

Rothbard began to consider himself a private property anarchist in 1950 and later began to use "anarcho-capitalist" to describe his political ideology.&lt;ref name="Crocetta"&gt;Roberta Modugno Crocetta, [https://mises.org/journals/scholar/roberta.pdf Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism in the contemporary debate. A critical defense], [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Exclusive Interview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Michael|title=Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard|journal=The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal|date=February 25, 1972|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html |quote=Capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his anarcho-capitalist model, a system of protection agencies compete in a free market and are voluntarily supported by consumers who choose to use their protective and judicial services. Anarcho-capitalism would mean the end of the state [[monopoly on force]].&lt;ref name="Crocetta"/&gt;

In ''Man, Economy, and State'', Rothbard divides the various kinds of state intervention in three categories: "autistic intervention", which is interference with private non-economic activities; "binary intervention", which is forced exchange between individuals and the state; and "triangular intervention", which is state-mandated exchange between individuals. According to Sanford Ikeda, Rothbard's typology "eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that appear in Mises's original formulation".&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, Sanford, ''Dynamics of the Mixed Economy: Toward a Theory of Interventionism'', Routledge UK, 1997, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. [https://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap14.asp Chapter 2 "Fundamentals of Intervention"] from ''Man, Economy and State'', [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard writes in ''[[Power and Market]]'' that the role of the economist in a free market is limited, but it is much larger in a government that solicits economic policy recommendations. Rothbard argues that self-interest therefore prejudices the views of many economists in favor of increased government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Peter G. Klein, [https://www.mises.org/story/2318 "Why Intellectuals Still Support Socialism"], [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], November 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap19.asp ''Man, Economy, and State'', Chapter 7 – Conclusion: Economics and Public Policy], [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race, gender and civil rights===
Michael O'Malley, Associate Professor of History at [[George Mason University]], characterizes Rothbard's "overall tone regard[ing]" the [[civil rights movement]] and the women's suffrage movement to be "contemptuous and hostile".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;O'Malley, Michael (2012). ''Face Value: The Entwined Histories of Money and Race in America.'' Chicago, Illinois: University of Chicago Press. pp. 205–07&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard vilified women's rights activists, attributing the growth of the welfare state to politically active spinsters "whose busybody inclinations were not fettered by the responsibilities of health and heart". Rothbard had pointed out in his ''Origins of the Welfare State'' that progressives had evolved from elitist Gilded Age pietist Protestants that wanted to bring a secularized version of millennialism under a welfare state, which was spearheaded by a "shock troop of Yankee protestant and Jewish women and lesbian spinsters".&lt;ref&gt;Murray N. Rothbard (August 11, 2006). [https://mises.org/daily/2225 "Origins of the Welfare State in America"]. ''mises.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard called for the elimination of "the entire 'civil rights' structure" stating that it "tramples on the property rights of every American". He consistently favored repeal of the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]], including Title VII regarded employment discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch69.html|title=The Great Thomas &amp; Hill Show: Stopping the Monstrous Regiment|website=archive.lewrockwell.com|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418134336/https://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch69.html|archive-date=April 18, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for overturning the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision on the grounds that forced integration of schools was aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2015/11/lew-rockwell/open-borders-assault-private-property/|title=Open Borders Are an Assault on Private Property – LewRockwell LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an essay called "Right-wing Populism", Rothbard proposed a set of measures to "reach out" to the "middle and working classes", which included urging the police to crack down on "street criminals", writing that "cops must be unleashed" and "allowed to administer instant punishment, subject of course to liability when they are in error". He also advocated that the police "clear the streets of bums and vagrants" and quipped "who cares?" in response to the question of where these people would go after being removed from public property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html|title=Right-Wing Populism|website=archive.lewrockwell.com|accessdate=July 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524131828/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html|archive-date=May 24, 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard held strong opinions about many leaders of the civil rights movement. He considered black separatist [[Malcolm X]] to be a "great black leader" and integrationist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] to be favored by whites because he "was the major restraining force on the developing Negro revolution".&lt;ref name="Enemy" /&gt;{{rp|page=167}} Rothbard praised Malcolm X for "acting white" through use of his intellect and wit and contrasted him favorably with the "fraudulent intellectual with a rococo Black Baptist minister style, "Dr." King". However, while he compared Malcolm X's black nationalism favorably to King's integrationism and for a time praised black nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_3/3_3_2.pdf|title=The Black Revolution|last=Clay|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=July 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993 he rejected the vision of a "separate black nation", asking "does anyone really believe that [...] New Africa would be content to strike out on its own, with no massive "foreign aid" from the U.S.A.?".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray N. (February 1993). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/murray-n-rothbard/their-malcolm-and-mine/ "Their Malcolm ... and Mine."] LewRockwell.com&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard also suggested that opposition to King, whom he demeaned as a "coercive integrationist", should be a litmus test for members of his "[[paleolibertarian]]" political movement.&lt;ref&gt;Pendelton, Arthur (May 14, 2008). [http://www.vdare.com/articles/lew-rockwell-and-the-strange-death-or-at-least-suspended-animation-of-paleolibertarianism "Lew Rockwell And The Strange Death (Or At Least Suspended Animation) Of Paleolibertarianism."] VDARE.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (November 1994). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch16.html "Big-Government Libertarians."] ''LewRockwell.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist [[Jean Hardisty]] commented on Rothbard's "praise" of the argument, made in [[Richard Herrnstein]] and [[Charles Murray (political scientist)|Charles Murray]]'s book ''[[The Bell Curve]]'', that blacks tend to score on average lower than whites on IQ tests.&lt;ref&gt;Hardisty, Jean (1999). ''Mobilizing Resentment, Conservative Resurgence from the John Birch Society to the Promise Keepers''. Boston, MA: Beacon Press. pp. 165–67&lt;/ref&gt; Hardisty noted that Rothbard's remark on intellectual and "temperamental" differences between races are "self-evident".

===Opposition to war===
Like [[Randolph Bourne]], Rothbard believed that "war is the health of the state". According to David Gordon, this was the reason for Rothbard's opposition to aggressive [[foreign policy]].&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; Rothbard believed that stopping new wars was necessary and that knowledge of how government had led citizens into earlier wars was important. Two essays expanded on these views "War, Peace, and the State" and "The Anatomy of the State". Rothbard used insights of [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Gaetano Mosca]] and [[Robert Michels]] to build a model of state personnel, goals and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joseph R. |last=Stromberg |url=http://antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4296 |title=Murray Rothbard on States, War, and Peace: Part I |date=January 10, 2005 |publisher=[[Antiwar.com]] |origyear=first published June 12, 2000}} Also see [http://www.antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4420 Part II], originally published June 20, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See both essays: Rothbard, Murray.

Rothbard's colleague Joseph Stromberg notes that Rothbard made two exceptions to his general condemnation of war: "the [[American Revolution]] and the [[War for Southern Independence]], as viewed from the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] side".&lt;ref&gt;Stromberg, Joseph (June 12, 2000). [http://antiwar.com/stromberg/?articleid=4296 "Murray N. Rothbard on States, War, and Peace: Part I."] Antiwar.com&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard condemned the "Northern war against slavery", saying it was inspired by "fanatical" religious faith and characterized by "a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions, to commit mayhem and mass murder, to plunder and loot and destroy, all in the name of high moral principle".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1991).

===Middle East conflict===
Rothbard's ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'' blamed the Middle East conflict on Israeli aggression "fueled by American arms and money". Rothbard warned that the Middle East conflict would draw the United States into a world war. He was [[anti-Zionist]] and opposed United States involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard criticized the [[Camp David Accords]] for having betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed [[1982 Lebanon War|Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Ronald |editor1-last=Lora |editor2-first=William Henry (eds.) |editor2-last=Longton |title=The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America |chapter=''Libertarian Forum'' 1969–1986 |first=Marvin |last=Perry |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ioakmq8yxA4C&amp;pg=PA372 372] |isbn=0-313-21390-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, "War Guilt in the Middle East", Rothbard states that Israel refused "to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |date=Autumn 1967 |url=https://mises.org/journals/lar/pdfs/3_3/3_3_4.pdf |title=War Guilt in the Middle East |journal=Left and Right |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=20–30}} Reprinted in {{cite book |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought (The Complete Edition, 1965–1968) |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |location=Auburn, Alabama |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-61016-040-7 |oclc=741754456}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took negative views of the [[two state solution]] for the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who come from all over the world, and who claim the entire land area as "given" to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no "peace" in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy no one. That is the harsh reality of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rothbard |first1=Murray N. |title=The Vital Importance of Separation |url=https://www.unz.com/print/RothbardRockwellReport-1994apr-00001/ |publisher=The Rothbard-Rockwell Report |accessdate=5 November 2018 |date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Historical revisionism===
Rothbard embraced "historical revisionism" as an antidote to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt "court intellectuals" over mainstream historical narratives.&lt;ref name="Enemy"/&gt;{{rp|pages=15, 62, 141}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rothbard, Murray (February 1976). [https://mises.org/daily/1541/ "The Case for Revisionism."] Mises.org&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of "the state" in exchange for "wealth, power, and prestige" from the state.&lt;ref name="Enemy" /&gt;{{rp|page=15}} Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as "penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was influenced by and called a champion of the historian [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], a [[Holocaust denier]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Badie, Dirk Berg-Schlosser, Leonardo Morlino, Editors, ''International Encyclopedia of Political Science, Volume 1,'' "Revisionism" entry, SAGE, 2011 [https://books.google.com/books?id=t0JZp-jrotQC&amp;pg=PA2310&amp;dq=Murray+rothbard+historical+revisionism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qmH8UdTYFNS34APin4B4&amp;ved=0CHcQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Murray%20rothbard%20historical%20revisionism&amp;f=false p. 2310], {{ISBN|1412959632}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Raimondo |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Raimondo |title=An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N.

In addition to broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1968). [https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/murray-n-rothbard/cold-war-myths/ "Harry Elmer Barnes as Revisionist of the Cold War."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard's endorsing of World War II revisionism and his association with Barnes and other Holocaust deniers have drawn criticism from within the political right. [[Kevin D. Williamson]] wrote an opinion piece published by ''[[National Review]]'' which condemned Rothbard for "making common cause with the 'revisionist' historians of the Third Reich", a term he used to describe American Holocaust deniers associated with Rothbard, such as [[James J. Martin]] of the [[Institute for Historical Review]]. The piece also characterized "Rothbard and his faction" as being "culpably indulgent" of Holocaust denial, the view which "specifically denies that the Holocaust actually happened or holds that it was in some way exaggerated".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin D. Williamson|Williamson, Kevin D]]. (January 23, 2012). [http://www.nationalreview.com/nrd/articles/293707/courting-cranks/page/0/3?cb=1 "Courting the Cranks."] ''[[National Review]]'', January 2013 edition. p. 4 {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for Rothbard's 50th birthday, Rothbard's friend and [[Buffalo State College]] historian [[Ralph Raico]] stated that Rothbard "is the main reason that revisionism has become a crucial part of the whole libertarian position".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raico|first=Ralph|title=Rothbard at his Semi-Centennial|url=https://mises.org/daily/4436/Murray-Rothbard-at-His-Semicentennial|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=November 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's rights and parental obligations===
In the ''Ethics of Liberty'', Rothbard explores issues regarding [[children's rights]] in terms of self-ownership and contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.l4l.org/library/chilroth.html |title=Children's Rights versus Murray Rothbard's ''The Ethics of Liberty'' |first=John |last=Walker |year=1991 |publisher=[[Libertarians for Life]] |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include support for a woman's right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children have the right to [[Runaway (dependent)|run away]] from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He asserted that parents have the right to put a child out for [[adoption]] or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a "flourishing free market in children". He believes that [[Child-selling|selling children]] as consumer goods in accord with market forces—while "superficially monstrous"—will benefit "everyone" involved in the market: "the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing".&lt;ref name="Children and Rights"&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray N Rothbard|title=The Ethics of Liberty|chapter=14 "Children and Rights"| isbn=9780814775592|year=1982| publisher=LvMI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Ronald Hamowy|Hamowy, Ronald]] (editor) (2008). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC ''The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism''], [[Cato Institute]], SAGE, pp. 59–61, {{ISBN|1-4129-6580-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6580-4}} {{OCLC|233969448}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rothbard's view of parenthood, "the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights".&lt;ref name="Children and Rights"/&gt; Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation and should be free to engage in other forms of [[child neglect]]. However, according to Rothbard, "the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, "the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum".&lt;ref name="Children and Rights"/&gt;

Economist Gene Callahan of [[Cardiff University]], formerly a scholar at the Rothbard-affiliated Mises Institute, observes that Rothbard allows "the logical elegance of his legal theory" to "trump any arguments based on the moral reprehensibility of a parent idly watching her six-month-old child slowly starve to death in its crib".&lt;ref name="Callahan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Callahan |first=Gene |date=February 2013 |url=http://ppe.sagepub.com/content/12/1/48.full.pdf+html |title=Liberty versus Libertarianism |journal=[[Politics, Philosophy &amp; Economics (journal)|Politics, Philosophy &amp; Economics]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=48–67 |doi=10.1177/1470594X11433739 |issn=1470-594X |oclc=828009007 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties===
Rothbard consistently advocated for abolition of the subpoena power, court attendance, contempt of court powers, coerced testimony of witnesses, compulsory jury duty and the bail system, arguing that all these functions of the judiciary were violations of natural rights and American common law. He instead advocated that until a defendant is convicted, he or she should not be held in prison or jails, writing that "except in those cases where the criminal has been caught red-handed and where a certain presumption of guilt therefore exists, it is impossible to justify any imprisonment before conviction, let alone before trial. And even when someone is caught red-handed, there is an important reform that needs to be instituted to keep the system honest: subjecting the police and the other authorities to the same law as everyone else. If everyone is supposed to be subject to the same criminal law, then exempting the authorities from that law gives them a legal license to commit continual aggression. The policeman who apprehends a criminal and arrests him, and the judicial and penal authorities who incarcerate him before trial and conviction—all should be subject to the universal law". Rothbard argued that police who make wrongful arrests or indictments should be charged with kidnapping.&lt;ref name="mises2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/tyranny-government-courts-and-prisons|title=The Tyranny of Government Courts and Prisons &amp;#124; Mises Institute|website=mises.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retributive theory of criminal justice===
In ''The Ethics of Liberty'', Rothbard advocates for a "frankly retributive theory of punishment" or a system of "a tooth (or two teeth) for a tooth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/thirteen.asp |chapter=Punishment and Proportionality |pages=85–97 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8147-7506-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard emphasizes that all punishment must be proportional, stating that "the criminal, or invader, loses his rights to the extent that he deprived another man of his".&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Morimura, Susumu (1999). "Libertarian theories of punishment." In P. Smith &amp; P. Comanducci (Eds.), ''Legal Philosophy: General Aspects: Theoretical Examinations and Practical Application'' (pp. 135–38). New York, NY: Franz Steiner Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying his retributive theory, Rothbard states that a thief "must pay double the extent of theft". Rothbard gives the example of a thief who stole $15,000 and says he not only would have to return the stolen money, but also provide the victim an additional $15,000, money to which the thief has forfeited his right. The thief would be "put in a [temporary] state of enslavement to his victim" if he is unable to pay him immediately. Rothbard also applies his theory to justify beating and torturing violent criminals, although the beatings are required to be proportional to the crimes for which they are being punished.

====Torture of criminal suspects====
In chapter twelve of ''Ethics'',&lt;ref name=SelfDefense&gt;{{cite book |url=https://mises.org/rothbard/ethics/twelve.asp |chapter=Self-Defense |pages=77–84 |author=Rothbard, Murray |title=The Ethics of Liberty |publisher=New York University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-8147-7506-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police.&lt;ref name="Callahan" /&gt; He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime. Writes Rothbard: "Suppose [...] police beat and torture a suspected murderer to find information (not to wring a confession, since obviously a coerced confession could never be considered valid). If the suspect turns out to be guilty, then the police should be exonerated, for then they have only ladled out to the murderer a parcel of what he deserves in return; his rights had already been forfeited by more than that extent. But if the suspect is not convicted, then that means that the police have beaten and tortured an innocent man, and that they in turn must be put into the dock for criminal assault".&lt;ref name=SelfDefense/&gt; Gene Callahan examines this position and concludes that Rothbard rejects the widely held belief that torture is inherently wrong, no matter who the victim. Callahan goes on to state that Rothbard's scheme gives the police a strong motive to [[Frameup|frame]] the suspect after having tortured him or her.&lt;ref name="Callahan" /&gt;

===Science and scientism===
In an essay condemning "[[scientism]] in the study of man", Rothbard rejected the application of [[causal determinism]] to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings—as opposed to those of everything else in nature—are not determined by prior causes, but by "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|free will]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1960). [https://mises.org/rothbard/mantle.asp "The Mantle of Science."] Reprinted from ''Scientism and Values'', Helmut Schoeck and James W. Wiggins, eds. (Princeton, N.J.: D. Van Nostrand), 1960, pp. 159–80, {{ISBN|978-0405004360}} ; ''The Logic of Action One: Method, Money, and the Austrian School'' (Cheltenham UK: Edward Elgar, 1997), pp. 3–23. {{ISBN|978-1858980157}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will". Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics and political science to create a "science of liberty". Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: ''[[For a New Liberty]]'', published in 1973; and ''[[The Ethics of Liberty]]'', published in 1982. In his ''[[Power and Market]]'' (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.

==Political activism==
As a young man, Rothbard considered himself part of the [[Old Right (United States)|Old Right]], an [[Anti-statism|anti-statist]] and anti-[[economic interventionism|interventionist]] branch of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], Rothbard, "as a Jewish student at Columbia, horrified his peers by organizing a Students for [[Strom Thurmond]] chapter, so staunchly did he believe in [[states' rights]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Daniel |date=March 12, 2007 |url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/mar/12/00027/ |title=Enemies of the State |publisher=''[[The American Conservative]]'' |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, Rothbard's "long and winding yet somehow consistent road had taken him from anti-[[New Deal]] and anti-interventionist [[Robert Taft Jr.|Robert Taft]] supporter into friendship with the quasi-pacifist [[Nebraska]] Republican Congressman [[Howard Buffett]] (father of [[Warren Buffett]]) then over to the League of (Adlai) Stevensonian Democrats and, by 1968, into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kauffman |first=Bill |authorlink=Bill Kauffman |date=May 19, 2008 |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/when-the-left-was-right/ |title=When the Left Was Right |publisher=''[[The American Conservative]]'' |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard advocated an alliance with the [[New Left]] anti-war movement on the grounds that the conservative movement had been completely subsumed by the statist establishment. However, Rothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a "[[People's Republic]]" style [[Conscription|draft]]. It was during this phase that he associated with [[Karl Hess]] and founded ''[[Left and Right: A Journal of Libertarian Thought]]'' with [[Leonard Liggio]] and George Resch, which existed from 1965 to 1968.

From 1969 to 1984, he edited ''[[The Libertarian Forum]]'', also initially with Hess (although Hess's involvement ended in 1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/daily/4330 |title=Karl Hess and the Death of Politics |first=Jeff |last=Riggenbach |date=May 13, 2010 |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Libertarian Forum'' provided a platform for Rothbard's writing. Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the ''[[National Review]]'' in nationwide debate. Rothbard rejected the view that [[Ronald Reagan]]'s 1980 election as President was a victory for libertarian principles and he attacked Reagan's economic program in a series of ''Libertarian Forum'' articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan's claims of spending cuts a "fraud" and a "hoax" and accused Reaganites of doctoring the economic statistics in order to give the false impression that their policies were successfully reducing inflation and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Lora, William Henry Longton, editors, ''The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America'', Chapter "The Libertarian Forum", Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ioakmq8yxA4C&amp;pg=PA372&amp;dq=Murray+Rothbard+nonintervention+foreign+policy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0HT4UbrPAsKCyAHn44HIAg&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Murray%20Rothbard%20nonintervention%20foreign%20policy&amp;f=false p. 372], {{ISBN|0313213909}},&lt;/ref&gt; He further criticized the "myths of Reaganomics" in 1987.&lt;ref name="mises3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/myths-reaganomics|title=The Myths of Reaganomics &amp;#124; Mises Institute|website=mises.org|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard criticized the "frenzied nihilism" of left-wing libertarians, but also criticized right-wing libertarians who were content to rely only on education to bring down the state; he believed that libertarians should adopt any moral tactic available to them in order to bring about liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Marvin |last=Perry |chapter=Libertarian Forum 1969–1986 |editor1-last=Lora |editor1-first=Ronald |editor2-last=Henry |editor2-first=William Longton (eds.) |title=The Conservative Press in Twentieth-Century America |location=Westport, Connecticut |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=0-313-21390-9 |oclc=40481045 |page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lewrockwell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Lew Rockwell]]]]
Imbibing Randolph Bourne's idea that "war is the health of the state", Rothbard opposed all wars in his lifetime and engaged in anti-war activism.&lt;ref name="Gordon"/&gt; During the 1970s and 1980s, Rothbard was active in the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. He was frequently involved in the party's internal politics. He was one of the founders of the [[Cato Institute]] and "came up with the idea of naming this libertarian think tank after ''[[Cato's Letters]]'', a powerful series of British newspaper essays by John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon which played a decisive influence upon America's Founding Fathers in fomenting the Revolution".&lt;ref name="Burris"&gt;{{cite web |last=Burris |first=Charles |date=February 4, 2011 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/lrc-blog/kochs-v-soros-a-partial-backstory/ |title=Kochs v. Soros: A Partial Backstory |publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]] |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/papers/25th_annual_report.pdf |title=25 years at the Cato Institute: The 2001 Annual Report |pages=11, 12 |accessdate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1978 to 1983, he was associated with the [[LPRadicals|Libertarian Party Radical Caucus]], allying himself with [[Justin Raimondo]], [[Eric Garris]] and [[Williamson Evers]]. He opposed the "low-tax liberalism" espoused by 1980 Libertarian Party presidential candidate [[Ed Clark]] and Cato Institute president [[Ed Crane (Libertarian)|Edward H Crane III]]. According to Charles Burris, "Rothbard and Crane became bitter rivals after disputes emerging from the 1980 LP presidential campaign of Ed Clark carried over to strategic direction and management of Cato".&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt;

Rothbard split with the Radical Caucus at the 1983 national convention over cultural issues and aligned himself with what he called the "[[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist]]" wing of the party, notably Lew Rockwell and [[Ron Paul]], who [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 1988|ran for President on the Libertarian Party ticket in 1988]]. Rothbard "worked closely with Lew Rockwell (joined later by his long-time friend [[Burton Blumert]]) in nurturing the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], and the publication, ''The Rothbard-Rockwell Report''; which after Rothbard's 1995 death evolved into the website, ''LewRockwell.com''".&lt;ref name=Burris/&gt;

===Paleolibertarianism===
In 1989, Rothbard left the Libertarian Party and began building bridges to the post-[[Cold War]] anti-interventionist right, calling himself a [[paleolibertarian]], a conservative reaction against the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism.&lt;ref name="Paul Newsletters"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sanchez |first1=Julian |last2=Weigel |first2=David |title=Who Wrote Ron Paul's Newsletters? |journal=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |date=January 16, 2008 |url=http://reason.com/archives/2008/01/16/who-wrote-ron-pauls-newsletter/singlepage |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (November 1994). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch16.html "Big Government Libertarianism"], LewRockwell.com&lt;/ref&gt; Paleolibertarianism sought to appeal to disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics. According to [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']], Rothbard advocated right-wing populism in part because he was frustrated that mainstream thinkers were not adopting the libertarian view and suggested that former KKK Grand Wizard [[David Duke]] and Wisconsin Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] were models for an "Outreach to the Rednecks" effort that could be used by a broad libertarian/paleoconservative coalition. Working together, the coalition would expose the "unholy alliance of 'corporate liberal' Big Business and media elites, who, through big government, have privileged and caused to rise up a parasitic Underclass". Rothbard blamed this "Underclass" for "looting and oppressing the bulk of the middle and working classes in America".&lt;ref name="Paul Newsletters" /&gt; Rothbard noted that Duke's substantive political program in a Louisiana governor's race had "nothing" in it that "could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleo-libertarians; lower taxes, dismantling the bureaucracy, slashing the welfare system, attacking affirmative action and racial set-asides, calling for equal rights for all Americans, including whites".&lt;ref name="lewrockwell"&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html |title=Right-wing Populism |publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]] |date=January 1992 |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160524131828/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/ir/Ch5.html |archive-date=May 24, 2016 |dead-url=yes  }} Originally published in the [http://www.unz.org/Pub/RothbardRockwellReport-1992jan-00005 January 1992] Rothbard-Rockwell Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothbard supported the presidential campaign of [[Pat Buchanan]] in 1992 and wrote that "with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray|last=Rothbard |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard219.html |title=Strategy for the Right |publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]] |accessdate=August 14, 2013}} First published in ''The Rothbard-Rockwell Report'', January 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; When Buchanan dropped out of the Republican primary race, Rothbard then shifted his interest and support to [[Ross Perot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rockwell, Jr. |first=Llewellyn H. |title=Still the State's Greatest Living Enemy |url=https://mises.org/daily/1788 |work=Mises Daily |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |authorlink=Lew Rockwell |date=April 8, 2005 |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who Rothbard wrote had "brought an excitement, a verve, a sense of dynamics and of open possibilities to what had threatened to be a dreary race".&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (June 1, 1992) [http://articles.latimes.com/1992-06-01/local/me-286_1_ross-perot "Little Texan Connects Big With Masses: Perot is a populist in the content of his views and in the manner of his candidacy"], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbard ultimately supported [[George H. W. Bush]] over [[Bill Clinton]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rothbard |first=Murray |title=Hold Back the Hordes for 4 More Years: Any sensible American has one real choice – George Bush |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-07-30/local/me-4460_1_george-bush |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=July 30, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Raimondo |first=Justin |authorlink=Justin Raimondo |date=October 1, 2012 |url=http://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/09/30/race-for-the-white-house-2012-whom-to-root-for/ |title=Race for the White House, 2012: Whom to Root For? |publisher=[[Antiwar.com]] |accessdate=August 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Buchanan, Rothbard opposed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charley Reese|Reese, Charley]] (October 14, 1993) [http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-10-14/news/9310130757_1_nafta-mexico-illegal-immigration "The U.S. Standard Of Living Will Decline If Nafta Is Approved"], ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1995 he had become disillusioned with Buchanan, believing that the latter's "commitment to protectionism was mutating into an all-round faith in economic planning and the nation state".&lt;ref&gt;Lew Rockwell, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html "What I Learned From Paleoism"], [[LewRockwell.com]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rothbard's death in 1995, Lew Rockwell, president of the Mises Institute, told ''The New York Times'' that Rothbard was "the founder of right-wing anarchism".&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] wrote a critical obituary in the ''National Review'', criticizing Rothbard's "defective judgment" and views on the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name="Casey"/&gt;{{rp|pages=3–4}} The Mises Institute published ''Murray N. Rothbard, In Memoriam'' which included memorials from 31 individuals, including libertarians and academics.&lt;ref name="Murray N. Rothbard, In Memoriam"&gt;''[http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Murray%20N%20Rothbard/memoriam.pdf Murray N. Rothbard, In Memoriam]'', Preface by JoAnn Rothbard, edited by Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr, published by Ludwig von Mises Institute,1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Brian Doherty summarizes Buckley's obituary as follows: "[W]hen Rothbard died in 1995, his old pal William Buckley took pen in hand to piss on his grave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Jonah|title=Idealists vs. Empiricists|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/194277/idealists-v-empiricists/jonah-goldberg|publisher=New Republic|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoppe, Rockwell and Rothbard's colleagues at the Mises Institute took a different view, arguing that he was one of the most important philosophers in history.&lt;ref name="Murray N.

'''Mária Wittner''' (''Gazdagh-Wittner;'' born 9 June 1937)&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.hu/kepv/eletrajz/hu/g036.pdf |title=''Biography'' |publisher=[[National Assembly of Hungary|Országgyűlés]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Hungarian revolutionary and politician who participated in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]].

==Early life==
Wittner was born in [[Budapest]] on 9 June 1937. She did not know her father and her mother sent her to nurses. At the age of two she was sent to a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] cloister. In 1948, she met with her mother, who after a short period of time sent her to state care. She discontinued her secondary school studies and began to work as a typist and shorthand writer in Szolnok and for the Council of Kiskunhegyes district. She gave birth to a son in 1955 and after a half year moved to Budapest. She undertook odd jobs at that time.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

==1956 revolution and aftermath==
She participated in the demonstration on October 23, 1956 and joined the revolutionaries during the siege of the [[Magyar Rádió]] building. She met Katalin Havrila and on the following days they together helped the provision of the wounded. Later she became a member of the Vajdahunyad Street resistance group and with her companion they occupied the Police station of the tenth district to find weapons on October 30, 1956. She was wounded by shrapnel in [[Üllői út]] on 4 November during the Soviet invasion.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

She was treated in Péterfy Sándor State Hospital. She tried to escape from the occupied country but she was arrested. After questioning she was set free and tried to flee the country once again and spent a few weeks in [[Austria]]. Then she came back to Hungary and began to work as an unskilled worker. She was arrested on July 16, 1957 and was sentenced to death on 23 July 1958. The sentence was modified to life imprisonment by the second appeal court on February 24, 1959. She was released from prison on March 25, 1970.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

Firstly she worked in a dressmaker's room and later as a cleaner. From 1980 onwards, she has been a disability pensioner. After the [[End of Communism in Hungary (1989)|change of the political system in Hungary]] she has been actively involved in the work of different veteran organisations of the 1956 revolution. She was awarded with the Grand Cross [[Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;

==Political career==
Wittner was elected Member of Parliament from the [[Fidesz]] National List in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2006|2006]] and [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary elections]]. She was a member of the Committee on Employment and Labour between May 30, 2006 and May 13, 2010. She was appointed a member of the Committee on Human Rights, Minority, Civic and Religious Affairs on 14 May 2010.&lt;ref name="Register"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.hu/internet/plsql/ogy_kpv.kepv_adat?p_azon=g036&amp;p_ckl=39 |title=''Register'' |publisher=[[National Assembly of Hungary|Országgyűlés]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

]] in [[Munich]]'s Old Town. Here is a large number of [[retail]] shops and restaurants to be found.

== Location and direction ==
The road runs almost straight ahead in the southeast-northwest direction out of town, from the intersection Färbergraben, or Augustinerstraße, to [[Karlsplatz (Stachus)]]. It has a length of about 350 meters. In the direction of [[Marienplatz]], Neuhauser Straße becomes [[Kaufingerstraße]]. Below the Neuhauser Straße and the Kaufingerstraße are the main lines of the [[Munich S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] that runs between the stops Marienplatz and Karlsplatz.

== History ==
[[File:Neuhauser 1900 6.jpg|thumb|left|Neuhauser Straße (partial view, 1900)]]
The street exists since at least 1293 (first mention) and was called Karlstraße from 1815 to 1828,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Dollinger | first=Hans | date= | title=Die Münchner Staßennahmen | language=German | location=Munich | publisher=Suedwest Verlag | page=209 | isbn=3-7787-2143-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then Neuhausergasse. It was rebuilt in 1972 from a main traffic connection with two tram-rails into a pedestrian zone; the reason for this was the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] with a huge influx of additional traffic to be expected. The street is named after the former village and today's [[Neuhausen-Nymphenburg|Neuhausen]] district, where the road leads out of town. South along the road is the ''Angerviertel'' (Angers quarter) and north the ''Hackenviertel'' (Hacken quarter).

== Buildings (selection) ==
[[File:2271 - München - Michaelskirche am Neuhauser Straße.JPG|thumb|left|Neuhauser Straße with [[St Michael's Church (Neuhauser Straße, Munich)|St. Michael's]] and the [[Monastery]] church of [[Augustinian Church, Munich|St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist of the Augustinian Hermits]]]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2253">'''Paul Einhorn''' (born in [[Iecava]], [[Latvia]], the exact birth date is not known, died in 1655 in [[Jelgava]]) was a famous historian of the Latvians and a [[Lutheran]] pastor.&lt;ref name="vilis"/&gt;

In 1615 Paul Einhorn studied at the [[university of Rostock]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://purl.uni-rostock.de/matrikel/100023067 entry of Paul Einhorn] in the [[Rostock Matrikelportal]]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was a pastor from 1621 and [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] of [[Courland]] from 1636. He is described as an ardent Lutheran, and he spent much effort fighting against [[superstition]].  He received a good classical education which is also seen in his works, which gained its importance because of their description of Latvian pre-[[Christian]] beliefs, which he tried to exterminate.

He has published number of books:

* 1627 — "Wiederlegunge der Abgötterey..."
* 1636 — "Reformatio gentis Letticae..."

But he is mostly known because of his historical book about Latvians published in 1649 — "[[Historia Lettica]]" (das ist Beschreibung der Lettischen Nation in welcher von der Letten als alten Einwohner und Besitzer des Lieflandes, Curlandes und Semgallen Namen, Uhrsprung oder Ankunfft ihrem Gottes-Dienst, ihrer Republica oder Regimente so sie in der Heydenschafft gehabt, auch ihren Sitten, Geberden, Gewonheiten, Natur und Eigenschaften etc. gruendlich und uembstaendig Meldung geschickt.

Dorpt in Liefland Gedruckt durch Johann Vogeln, der Koenigl. Acad. Buchdruker, im Jahr 1649).

'''Rennes-le-Château''' ({{lang-oc|Rènnas del Castèl}}) is a small [[Communes of France|commune]] approximately 5&amp;nbsp;km (3 miles) south of [[Couiza]], in the [[Aude]] [[Departments of France|department]] in [[Languedoc]] in southern [[France]].

This small French hilltop village is known internationally, and receives tens of thousands of visitors per year, because of various [[conspiracy theories]], about an alleged buried [[treasure]] discovered by its 19th-century priest [[Bérenger Saunière]], the precise nature of which is disputed by those who believe in its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Article by Christiane Amiel entitled "L’abîme au trésor, ou l’or fantôme de Rennes-le-Château" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), ''Imaginaires archéologiques'', pages 61-86 (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: Éditions de la Maison des sciences de l’homme, 2008). {{ISBN|978-2-7351-1210-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mountains frame both ends of the region—the [[Cevennes]] to the northeast and the [[Pyrenees]] to the south. The area is known for beautiful scenery, with jagged ridges, deep river canyons and rocky limestone plateaus, with large caves underneath.

Rennes-le-Château was the site of a prehistoric encampment, and later a [[Roman empire|Roman colony]], or at least Roman villa or temple, such as is confirmed to have been built at [[Fa, Aude|Fa]], {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Couiza]], part of the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Narbonensis]], the wealthiest part of Roman [[Gaul]].

Rennes-le-Château was part of [[Septimania]] in the 6th and 7th centuries. It has been claimed that it was once an important Visigothic town, with some 30,000 people living in the city around 500-600&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tree of Life and the Holy Grail: Ancient and Modern Spiritual Paths and the Mystery of Rennes-le-Château|author=Francke, S.|date=2007|publisher=Temple Lodge|isbn=9781902636870|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=2X-fqVYhxfQC|page=4|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Holy Blood And The Holy Grail|author1=Lincoln, H.|author2=Baigent, M.|author3=Leigh, R.|date=2013|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781448183425|url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=o96yxrxEMOAC|page=35|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="beyond"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyond.fr/villages/rennes-le-chateau-provence-france.html|title=Rennes-le-Château visit, photos, travel info and hotels, by Provence Beyond|publisher=beyond.fr|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, British archaeologist Bill Putnam and British physicist John Edwin Wood argued that while there may have been a Visigothic town on the site of the present village, it would have had "a population closer to 300 than 30,000".&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam &amp; John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-Le-Château: A Mystery Solved'', Sutton Publishing, page 87, Revised Edition, 2005. {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1050 the [[Counts of Toulouse]] held control over the area, building a castle in Rennes-le-Château around 1002,&lt;ref&gt;Abbé Sabarthès, ''Dictionnaire topographique du Département de l'Aude, comprenant les noms de lieux anciens et modernes'' (1912).&lt;/ref&gt; though nothing remains above ground of this medieval structure—the present ruin is from the 17th or 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood. ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château: A Mystery Solved'', page 88 (Sutton Publishing Limited, revised paperback edition, 2005). {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several castles in the surrounding Languedoc region were central to the battle between the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Cathars]] at the beginning of the 13th century. Other castles guarded the volatile border with [[Spain]]. Whole communities were wiped out in the campaigns of the Catholic authorities to rid the area of the Cathar [[heretics]], the [[Albigensian Crusades]], and again when [[Huguenot|French Protestants]] fought against the [[French monarchy]] two centuries before the [[French Revolution]].

==Church of Saint Mary Magdalene==

[[File:Rennes-le-Château-Sainte-Marie-Madeleine-Interieur-Autel.jpg|thumb|left|Altar of Saint Mary Magdalene, it features a [[bas-relief]] of Mary Magdalene. At the bottom of the altar a Latin inscription (once lost, now restored), reads: ''Jesu medela vulnerum Spes una poenitentium Per Magdalenae lacrymas Peccata nostra diluas'', that translates as "Jesus, remedy against all our pains, The only hope for the penitent, Through the tears of Magdalen Thou washest away our sins"]]

The village church dedicated to Saint [[Mary Magdalene]] has been rebuilt several times. The earliest church of which there is any evidence on the site may date to the 8th century. However, this original church was almost certainly in ruins by the 10th or 11th century, when another church was built upon the site—remnants of which can be seen in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] pillared arcades on the north side of the [[apse]]. This survived in poor repair until the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;An architectural report of 1845 reporting that it required extensive repairs.&lt;/ref&gt; when it was renovated by the local priest, [[Bérenger Saunière]]. Surviving receipts and existing account books belonging to Saunière reveal that the renovation of the church, including works on the presbytery and cemetery, cost 11,605 Francs over a ten-year period between 1887 and 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, ''Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', page 130 (Editions Belisane, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St.Madeleine Inschrift.JPG|thumb|left|Latin inscription ''Terribilis est locus iste'' above church entrance]]

One of the new elements was the Latin inscription ''Terribilis est locus iste'' above the front doors, taken from the Common Dedication of a Church, which translates as: "This is a place of awe"; the rest of the dedication reads "this is God's house, the gate of heaven, and it shall be called the royal court of God." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ballyroanparish.ie/parish-information/parish-history Ballyroan Parish History, reference to the Entrance Antiphon from the Common of a Dedication of a Church&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the dedication is above the front doors—the rest inscribed on the arches over the two front doors of the church.

[[File:Asmodis Rennes.JPG|thumb|right|The figure of a Devil supporting the Holy Water Stoup.]]

Inside the church, one of the added figures was of a [[devil]] holding up the [[stoup|holy water stoup]]. Its original head was stolen in 1996 and has never been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Midi Libre]]'', 23 April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; A devil like figure holding up the holy water stoup is a rare and unusual choice for the interior decoration of a Church but not exclusive to the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene; a similar subject matter can be seen in the Saint Vincent [[Collegiate church]] in [[Montréal, Aude|Montréal]], a short distance from Rennes-le-Château.

The new figures and statues were not made especially for this church,&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam &amp; John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, a Mystery Solved'', page 167, new revised paperback edition 2005 {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but were chosen by Saunière from a catalogue published by Giscard, sculptor and painter in [[Toulouse]] who, among other things, offered statues and sculptures for church refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;Marie de Saint-Gély, ''Bérenger Saunière, prêtre Rennes-le-Château 1885–1917'' (Bélisane, 1989; 2005), p. XLII, XLIV and XLV, which has reproduced pages from the Giscard catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rennes-le-chateau-archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rennes-le-chateau-archive.com/images/giscard_catalogue/large/catalogue_giscard_1914.pdf |title=Downloadable Giscard &amp; Co catalogue from 1914 |publisher=rennes-le-chateau-archive.com|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunière also funded the construction of the Tour Magdala, a tower-like structure originally named the Tour de L'horloge and later renamed after Saint Mary Magdalene. Saunière used it as his library. The structure includes a circular [[turret]] with twelve [[crenellation]]s, on a [[belvedere (structure)|belvedere]] that connected it to an [[orangery]]. The tower has a promenade linking it to the [[Villa Bethania]], which was not actually used by the priest. He stated at his trial that it was intended as a home for retired priests.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, ''Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', Editions Belisane (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving receipts and existing account books belonging to Saunière reveal that the construction of his estate (including the purchases of land) between 1898 and 1905 cost 26,417 Francs.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, ''Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', page 175 (Editions Belisane, 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sauniere's renovations and redecoratations, the church was re-dedicated in 1897 by his bishop, [[Monsignor Billard]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Rivière, Le Fabuleux trésor de Rennes-le-Château, Editions Belisane (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Cahiers de Rennes-le-Château'' N°11, Abbé Bruno De Monts, "Le Vrai Trésor" (Editions Bélisane, 1996 {{ISBN|2-910730-12-3}}), p. 14; 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910–1911, Bérenger Saunière was summoned by the bishopric to appear before an ecclesiastical trial to face charges of [[simony|trafficking in masses]]. He was found guilty and suspended of the priesthood. When asked to produce his account books, he refused to attend his trial.

Believers in the enigma have suggested that Saunière's estate was set up on a large-scale checkerboard,&lt;ref&gt;Alain Féral, editor, ''Rennes-le-Château: Clef du Royaume des Morts'', Éditions Bélisane, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; while others have claimed that Saunière produced a [[Mirror image]] of selected architectural features of his property. They also allege that [[Maurice Barrès]]'s novels [[Roman à clef]] and [[The Sacred Hill]]&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, ''L'Or de Rennes'', page 57 (René Julliard, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; are largely based on the Rennes-le-Château story involving Bérenger Saunière (while novels by [[Jules Verne]] are cited to show that the enigma predates Abbé Saunière).&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lamy, ''The Secret Message of Jules Verne, Decoding His Masonic, Rosicrucian, and Occult Writings'', pages 137-138, Inner Traditions, 2007. {{ISBN|9781594771613}}. Translation from the French first published 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern fame==
The village received up to around 100,000 tourists each year at the height of popularity of [[Dan Brown]]'s bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref name="Brown 2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Dan|title=The da Vinci Code|date=2004|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=0385513755|edition=Special Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern reputation of Rennes-le-Château rises mainly from claims and stories dating from the mid-1950s concerning the local 19th-century priest Father Bérenger Saunière. These stories influenced the authors of the worldwide bestseller ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' in 1982, and that work in turn influenced Dan Brown when he wrote ''The Da Vinci Code'', published in 2003.

The first known popular article about Father Bérenger Saunière was written by Roger Crouquet in the Belgian magazine ''Le Soir illustré'', published in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Crouquet, ''Visite a une ville morte: Rennes-le-Château, autrefois Capitale du Comte de Razès, Aujourd'hui bourgade abandonne'' ("Visit to a dead village: Rennes-le-Château, former capital of the [[county of Razès]], now an abandoned village"), in ''Le Soir illustré'', pages 16-22 (number 819; March, 1948).&lt;/ref&gt;  The author was visiting the Aude to meet his friend Monsieur Jean Mauhin, who originated from Belgium and had moved to [[Quillan]] to open a factory making bells and hats, and at his suggestion decided it would be a good idea to visit Rennes-le-Château. There Crouquet collected the testimonies of the villagers about Saunière. One person told how the priest "preferred wine and women to practising the priesthood. At the end of the last century he had a rather original idea. He placed in foreign newspapers, especially in the United States, an advertisement announcing that the poor priest of Rennes-le-Château lived among heretics and had only the most meagre of resources. He moved the Christians of the whole world to such pity by announcing that the old church, an architectural gem, was heading for unavoidable destruction if urgent restoration work was not undertaken as soon as possible." Crouquet also added: "The stoup which decorates the entrance to the chapel is carried by a horned devil with cloven hooves. An old woman remarked to us: 'It's the old priest, changed  into a devil'."

Crouquet's article faded into obscurity and it was left to [[Noël Corbu]], a local man who had opened a restaurant in Saunière's former estate (called ''L'Hotel de la Tour'') in the mid-1950s, to turn the village into a household name. Corbu began circulating stories that Father Saunière had discovered "parchments" while renovating his church in 1892 that were to do with the treasure of [[Blanche of Castile]], and which "according to the archives" consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche de Castile to pay the ransom of [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis IX]], a prisoner of the infidels, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Château. Saunière had only found one part of it, so it was necessary to continue his investigations.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Salamon, ''D'un coup de pioche dans un pilier du maître-autel, l'abbé Saunière met à jour le trésor de Blanche de Castille'' ("With one blow of the pick-axe in a pillar of the main altar Abbé Saunière uncovered the treasure of Blanche de Castile"), in ''La Dépêche du Midi'' dated 12, 13, 14 January 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corbu also claimed that Rennes-le-Château was the capital of the Visigoths called ''Rhedae'', but this was another exaggeration: it was [[Narbonne]] that held that position. His claim can be traced back to a book by Louis Fédié entitled ''Le comté de Razès et le diocèse d'Alet'' (1880), that contained a chapter on the history of Rennes-le-Château; published as a booklet in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Fédié, ''Rhedae, la Cité des Chariots'' (Rennes-le-Château: Terre de Rhedae, 1994). {{ISBN|2-9506938-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noël Corbu incorporated this story into his essay ''L'histoire de Rennes-le-Château'' that was deposited at the Departmental Archives at [[Carcassonne]] on 14 June 1962. Fédié's assertions concerning the population and importance of Rennes-le-Château have since been contradicted by archaeology and the work of more recent historians.&lt;ref name="PutnamWood-p88"&gt;Bill Putnam &amp; John Edwin Wood, ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, a Mystery Solved'', page 88, new revised paperback edition 2005 {{ISBN|0-7509-4216-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Fourié, ''Rennes-le-Château: L’Histoire de Rennes-le-Château antérieure à 1789, Notes Historiques'', Editions Jean Bardou, Esperaza, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corbu's story was published in the book by Robert Charroux ''Trésors du monde'' in 1962,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charroux, ''Trésors du monde: enterrés, emmurés, engloutis'' (Paris: Fayard, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; that caught the attention of [[Pierre Plantard]], who decided to use and adapt Corbu's story for his own gain involving the mythological history of the [[Priory of Sion]], that inspired the 1967 book ''L'Or de Rennes'' by author [[Gérard de Sède]].&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, '' L'Or de Rennes, ou La Vie insolite de Bérenger Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château'' (René Julliard, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Sède's book contained reproductions of "parchments" allegedly discovered by the priest Bérenger Saunière alluding to the survival of the line of [[Dagobert II]], from which Plantard claimed to descent. Plantard and Sède fell out over book royalties and [[Philippe de Chérisey]], Plantard's friend, revealed to have forged the parchments as part of the plot. At the same time, Plantard and Chérisey were also involved in planting fabricated documents in France's [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]] that dealt with the secret history of the Priory of Sion.&lt;ref name="PutnamWood-p88" /&gt;

Corbu's story inspired author [[Robert Charroux]] to develop an active interest, and in 1958, with his wife Yvette and other members of The Treasure Seekers' Club that he founded in 1951, scanned the village and its church looking for treasure using a [[metal detector]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Charroux described his activities in Rennes-le-Château in his 1962 book ''Trésors du Monde enterrées, emmurés, engloutis'' (Fayard), that was published in English in 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, [[Henry Lincoln]], a British [[supporting actor]] and screenwriter for the [[BBC]], read Gérard de Sède's book while on holiday in the [[Cévennes]].He produced three [[BBC2]] [[Chronicle (UK TV series)|Chronicle]] documentaries between 1972 and 1979 and worked some of its material into the 1982 non-fictional bestseller, ''[[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]]'', that he co-wrote with [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]].&lt;ref name="Baigent Leigh Lincoln 1982"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baigent|first1=Michael|last2=Leigh|first2=Richard|last3=Lincoln|first3=Henry|title=Holy Blood, Holy Grail|date=1982|publisher=Delacorte Press &amp; Jonathan Cape|location=New York &amp; London|isbn=0440036623}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book alleged that the Priory of Sion guarded the [[Merovingian dynasty]]'s bloodline, that the dynasty descended from a supposed marriage of [[Jesus Christ]] and [[Mary Magdalene]] and that Pierre Plantard was a modern-day descendant; Bérenger Saunière allegedly discovered that secret and amasses his wealth by  blackmailing of the [[Holy See]].

The blood-line hypotheses of Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh were later picked up in 2003 by Dan Brown's bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''. Brown's novel never specifically mentioned Rennes-le-Château, but some key characters in the book had related names, such as Saunière, named after the priest, and "Leigh Teabing", whose name was derived from Richard Leigh and Michael Baigent. The two authors brought (and lost) a plagiarism suit against Brown in 2006. The extraordinary popularity of ''The Da Vinci Code'' reignited the interest of tourists, who come to the village to see sites associated with Saunière and Rennes-le-Château.

==Excavations==
The sudden interest in Saunière's church generated by the stories circulated by Noël Corbu in the 1950s inspired two excavations of the church of St Mary Magdalene. The first was conducted by Dr André Malacan in May 1956, who, after excavating the subsoil of the church at the depth of approximately one metre, discovered some bones that included a skull bearing an incision, but they failed to discover "anything of any interest".&lt;ref&gt;Descadeillas, ''Mythologie du Trésor de Rennes'', 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Malacan died in 1997, and the skull remained in the possession of his family until May 2014, when it was finally handed back to the village following several years of legal wrangling&lt;ref&gt;''L'Indépendant'', 31 May 2010; ''La Dépêche du Midi'', 19 May 2010; 4 June 2010; 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;(carbon-dating of the skull has dated it to between 1281 and 1396).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/07/06/2138918-le-crane-perce-livre-son-mystere.html ''La Dépêche du Midi'', 6 July 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1959 and 1963, Jacques Cholet, an engineer from Paris, also conducted several digs in the church, and also failed to discover anything of interest.&lt;ref name="renneslechateau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renneslechateau.com/anglais/rapport-cholet.htm |title=Rennes-le-Château, The Cholet Report (a translation of his Report dated 25 April 1967) |author=Atelier Empreinte 1997-2005|publisher=renneslechateau.com|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1956, Monsieur Cotte of the ''Société des arts et des sciences de Carcassonne'' asked the membership during its monthly session about the treasure of Rennes-le-Château, which led to an investigation of the subject matter. Two members conducted on-the-spot research in March 1957 that lasted for one year. Local historian René Descadeillas commented: "They found no evidence anywhere to support the assertion that, down the ages, any individual, family, group or clan could have accumulated a precious treasure-hoard at Rennes and then concealed it in the locality or its environs. What is more, the activities of the Abbé Saunière were undoubtedly eloquent of the sort of stratagems that he was accustomed to using in order to enrich himself."&lt;ref&gt;René Descadeillas, ''Mythologie du Trésor de Rennes'', pages 57-58 (Éditions Collot, 1991 reprint of the 1974 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, a much-publicised 2003 excavation of the floor of the Tour Magdala by the Mayor of the village produced a stone, and not any anticipated treasure,&lt;ref name="ladepeche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2003/08/21/142616-Il-n-y-a-rien-sous-la-tour-Magdala.html |title=''La Dépêche'' 21 August 2003 |publisher=ladepeche.fr|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  following-up claims made by a Canadian who said he was related to one of the foremen who supervised Saunière's works. Another request, at the same time, was also made to excavate the church, but permission was refused by the ''[[Direction régionale des affaires culturelles|Directions Régionales des Affaires Culturelles]]'' (or DRAC), the archaeological body of France.

==Conspiracy theories==
The entire area around Rennes-le-Château became the focus of sensational claims in the 1950s and 1960s involving Blanche of Castile, the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]],&lt;ref name="Gardner 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Laurence|title=The Grail enigma|date=2008|publisher=Harper Element|location=London|isbn=0 00 726694 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Knights Templar]], the [[Catharism|Cathars]], the treasures of the [[Temple of Solomon]] that was the booty of the [[Visigoths]] that included the [[Ark of the Covenant]] and the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] (the seven-branched candlestick from the Temple of Jerusalem). From the 1970s onwards claims have extended to the [[Priory of Sion]], the [[Rex Deus]], the [[Holy Grail]],&lt;ref name="Phillips 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Graham|title=The search for the Grail|date=1995|publisher=Century|location=London|isbn=0 7126 7533 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ley line]]s, [[sacred geometry]] alignments, the remains of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref name="A&amp;S 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andrews|first1=Richard|last2=Schellenberger|first2=Paul|title=The Tomb of God|date=1996|publisher=Little, Brown &amp; Co|location=Boston, New York, Toronto, London|isbn=0-316-04275-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged references to Mary Magdalene settling in the south of France,&lt;ref name="Phillips 2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phillips|first1=Graham|title=The Marian conspiracy|date=2000|publisher=Sidgwick &amp; Jackson|location=London|isbn=0 283 06341 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even [[flying saucer]]s. Well-known French authors like [[Jules Verne]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Lamy, ''Jules Verne, initié et initiateur: la clé du secret de Rennes-le-Château et le trésor des rois de France'' (Paris: Payot, 1984). {{ISBN|2-228-85020-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Leblanc]]&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Ferté, '' Arsène Lupin, supérieur inconnu: arcanes, filigranes et cryptogrammes, la clé de l'oeuvre codée de Maurice Leblanc'' (Paris: Éditions Guy Trédaniel, 1992). {{ISBN|2-85707-463-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; are suspected of leaving clues in their novels about their knowledge of the "mystery" of Rennes-le-Château.

Christiane Amiel has commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No new theory has ever succeeded in entirely replacing any of the previous ones and, as the researches have intensified, so the various lines of investigation have accumulated and crossed in a system of ramifications in which criticism of one line of approach simply gives rise to others&lt;ref name=Amiel&gt;Christiane Amiel, "L’abîme au trésor, ou l’or fantôme de Rennes-le-Château" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), ''Imaginaires archéologiques'' (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: Éditions de la Maison des sciences de l’homme, 2008). {{ISBN|978-2-7351-1210-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today the vogue is for analysing and checking the most minute details, for comparing and contrasting rival theories, for reviving old and unexplored lines of enquiry in a new guise, and for an unbridled pluralism which mixes together erudition and extrapolation, and makes recourse to geology, history, prehistory, esotericism, religious history, mysticism, the paranormal, ufology and other fields.&lt;ref name=Amiel/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rennes-le-Château conspiracy theories continue to be a popular ingredient in a publishing industry that is growing exponentially, and is the subject of press articles, radio and television  programmes and films. Websites and blogs devoted to the alleged 'mysteries' exist in many different countries and authors' interviews can be accessed on [[podcast]]s.

===Criticism===
Archaeologist [[Paul Bahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artandmind.org/pages/Biog/BahnPaul.htm |title=Bahn, Dr. Paul |last1=Kennard |first1=Garry |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |website=Art and Mind |publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406143149/http://www.artandmind.org/pages/Biog/BahnPaul.htm|archivedate=6 April 2012 |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered the various claims surrounding the village of Rennes-le-Château as pure myth "so beloved of occultists and 'aficionados' of the Unexplained". He ranks the stories among those of the [[Bermuda Triangle]], [[Atlantis]] and [[ancient astronauts]] as a source of "ill-informed and lunatic books".&lt;ref&gt;Paul G Bahn, "The ruins of a mystery" (''Times Literary Supplement'', 29 March 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise another archaeologist Bill Putnam, co-author with John Edwin Wood of ''The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château, A Mystery Solved'' (2003, 2005) has dismissed all of the popular allegations as [[pseudo-history]].

Laura Miller, contributor to ''[[The New York Times]]'' books section, commented how the village of Rennes-le-Château had become "a town that had become the French equivalent of [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]] or [[Loch Ness]] as a result of popular books by Gérard de Sède."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/22/books/the-last-word-the-da-vinci-con.html |title=THE LAST WORD; The Da Vinci Con |last1=Miller |first1=Laura |last2= |first2= |date=22 February 2004 |website=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christiane Amiel commented in 2008 that the treasure of Rennes-le-Château "seems to elude all the investigations that people make into it. Like the fairy gold which, in the popular fables, turns into manure as soon as a human being touches it, it remains impalpable. It can only exist as long as it remains on the distinctive level of the dream, between the real and the imaginary."&lt;ref&gt;Article by Christiane Amiel entitled "L’abîme au trésor, ou l’or fantôme de Rennes-le-Château" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), ''Imaginaires archéologiques,'' page 84 (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: Éditions de la Maison des sciences de l’homme, 2008). {{ISBN|978-2-7351-1210-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sounds of the 20th Century''''' is a [[BBC Radio 2]] documentary series originally broadcast in the UK between April 2011 and April 2012. Each 60-minute programme is dedicated to one year from 1951 to 2000 and features a montage of audio relating to that year. Featuring nothing that wasn’t heard, seen or read at the time, other than brief introduction to each episode by [[Jeremy Vine]], the series does not feature any explanations, reminiscenses or reflections upon the clips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sounds of the Twentieth Century|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0103r3t|work=BBC|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the series' website provided a list and description of the audio items, which was also supplied in real time by the show's [[Twitter]] feed. 

It is described as an 'audio journey through five decades of triumph, tragedy and trivia.'&lt;ref name="BBC Press Office"&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Press Office|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/2011/wk14/thu.shtml#thu_radio2|work=BBC Press|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first part of the series was first broadcast at 10pm on Thursday 7 April. Focussing upon 1951, it featured the real [[The King's Speech|King's Speech]] (as he opens the [[Festival of Britain]]), a [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|General Election]] victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and their [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] allies, the first hit single with [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]] ([[Les Paul]]’s "[[How High The Moon]]"), the first rock ’n’ roll record ([[Jackie Brentson]]’s "[[Rocket 88]]"), screen heroes from [[Marlon Brando]] to [[The Lone Ranger]].

The series was produced by [[Trevor Dann]]'s Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trevor Dann's Company: Current Projects|url=https://trevordannscompany.wordpress.com/current-projects/|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a series blog available at [http://sottc.wordpress.com sottc.wordpress.com].

The critical reception was generally positive. Comparing the show to BBC One's ''[[The Rock 'n' Roll Years]]'', ''[[The Independent]]''{{'}}s Chris Maume asked if "commissioning ''Sounds of the 20th Century'' [was] the first thing the 6 Music/Radio 2 controller [[Bob Shennan]] has got right in his short but deeply unsatisfactory tenure?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Maume |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/sounds-of-the-20th-century-radio-2-thursdaybrthe-4-oclock-show-radio-4-extra-monday-to-friday-2265612.html |work=The Independent |title=Sounds of the 20th Century, Radio 2 |date= 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; More critically, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Elisabeth Mahoney identified parallels between the archive clips and the contemporary world, but was frustrated at the lack of a narrative, arguing that "the jaunty mix is frustratingly hard-going."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Radio review: Sounds of the Twentieth Century|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/08/radio-review-sounds-of-twentieth-century  |first=Elisabeth |last=Mahoney |work=The Guardian |date=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{SpanishMissions}}
{{History of New Spain}}
The '''Spanish Missions in the Americas''' were Catholic [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] established by the [[Spanish Empire]] during the 16th to 19th centuries in areas extending from [[Mexico]] and southwestern portions of current-day United States to as far south as [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]].

== Introduction ==
At the start of the [[Age of Discovery]], European governments sent explorers to find trade routes to facilitate economic relations with Asia and Europe. During this time, these men found the new lands that could be used for the economic benefit of their home countries. In order to understand these new lands and the resources that might be available, explorers fostered relationships with the native people. This led to the colonization of the Americas. The [[Catholic Church]] was an essential part of both the Spanish and Portuguese Empires so as the empires spread to new lands, it was the duty of the King to be sure Christianity was spread into the New World.

Often these empires used missions to teach indigenous people about Christian values that were practised in Europe at this time.  These values did not only include religious teachings but cultural aspects of life such as dress and behavior. Missions were formed in different ways across the Americas that have had a lasting impact on the culture of these areas. Catholicism is still a prevalent religion in both North and South America. The formation and implementation of the missions across the New World reflected the beliefs of the Catholic clerics who created and implemented the missions. In the Catholic church, monks, priests and other clerics take vows and are affiliated with a certain order. These orders, their ideologies, and era can be linked to the way of life and teaching in the missions.

Despite extensive efforts and even successes in recovering the cultural history of the cultures colonized in the Americas, much of the evidence currently available comes from the colonizers themselves. Many of the cultures impacted by missionaries had no written language and were thus robbed of much of their oral history when the populations were decimated by [[Old World]] illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/impact-european-diseases-native-americans|title=The Impact of European Diseases on Native Americans – Dictionary definition of The Impact of European Diseases on Native Americans {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultures that did possess written language, such as the [[Mayan languages|Maya]], often had their artifacts deemed sacrilegious and burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4136621|title=Yucatan before and after the conquest|last=1524–1579.|first=Landa, Diego de,|date=1978|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=9780486236223|location=New York|oclc=4136621}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, much of the evidence of these events comes from accounts of missionaries and—to a much smaller extent—archaeological investigation, and should be handled with care. Therefore, readers should consider the ethnocentric and theocratic context in which accounts recorded by missionaries are presented.

== Spanish colonialism ==

=== Practices ===
Catholic missions were installed throughout the Americas in an effort to establish European order in the pursuit of gold, silver, and other resources. The missionaries' goal was to convert natives to Christianity and ease the transition into a colonial system and minimize the friction required to establish European dominance in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://missions.arizona.edu/en/history|title=History of Spanish Colonial Missions {{!}} Mission Initiative|website=missions.arizona.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; One symbolic example of this was the practice of constructing churches and cathedrals, such as [[Santo Domingo Church|Santa Domingo]] and [[Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption, Cusco|Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of the Assumption]], on top of demolished native temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.qosqo.com/catedral.shtml|title=Cathedral of Cusco City|website=www.qosqo.com|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishment of missions was often followed by the implementation of [[Encomienda]] systems, which forced native labor onto land granted to Europeans by the Spanish Crown and led to systematic oppression.

==Spanish Missionaries==
[[Pedro de Gante]] was a European missionary who desired assimilation of Native American communities in order to further educational discourse amongst indigenous communities. He was so influential in his work, he became known as "The first teacher of the Americas" (Campos, 89). Originally, Peeter Van der Moere, Pedro de Gante, came to [[New Spain]], in 1523 also known as Mexico. A missionary, Pedro de Gante, wanted to spread the Christian faith to his native brothers and sisters. During this time, the mentality of the Spanish people was to not empower the indigenous people with knowledge because it would give them motivation to retaliate over their Spanish rulers. Nevertheless, Pedro de Gante saw the ritualistic practices being made by the indigenous, sacrificing animals, and as a missionary, saw the need for a change in faith. He decided in order to best approach theses indigenous communities he had to adapt to their way of life. He learned their native tongue and participated in their conversations and games (Lipp, 194). Despite having a stutter, he was a successful translator of Nahuatl and Spanish (Campos, 89). Additionally, Pedro de Gante was a big advocate of education of the youth, where he established schools throughout Mexico to cater to the indigenous communities (Britannica, 1998). His influence spanned so wide, others like him followed by example. Of the future missionaries to come to America, at least three of his compatriots came (Proano, 1972).

=== Native revolts ===
In addition to the encomienda system, the aggressive implementation of missions and their forcible establishment of reductions and congregations led to resistance and sometimes revolt in the native populations being colonized. Many natives agreed to join the reductions and congregations out of fear, but many were initially still allowed to quietly continue some of their religious practices. However, as treatment of natives grew worse and suppression of native customs increased, so did the resistance of the natives.

The most notable example of rebellion against colonization is the [[Pueblo Revolt]] in 1680, in which the [[Zuni]], [[Hopi]], as well as [[Tiwa Puebloans|Tiwa]], [[Tewa]], [[Jemez language|Towa]], [[Potou–Tano languages|Tano]], and [[Keresan languages|Keres]]-speaking Pueblos took control of Santa Fe and drove the Spanish colonial presence out of New Mexico with heavy casualties on the Spanish side, including 21 of the 33 Franciscan missionaries in New Mexico. The region remained autonomous under native control despite multiple non-violent attempts at peace treaties and trade agreements until 1692.

The [[Tepehuán Revolt|Tepehuan Revolt]] was likewise stirred by hostilities against the missionaries, which arose due to the concurrent and explosive rise in disease that accompanied their arrival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44964404|title=The Tepehuan Revolt of 1616 : militarism, evangelism and colonialism in seventeenth century Nueva Vizcaya|last=May)|first=Gradie, Charlotte M. (Charlotte|date=2000|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=|isbn=0874806224|location=Salt Lake City|pages=26|oclc=44964404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tepehuán people|Tepehuan]] associated the rise in death directly with these missionaries and their reductions, which spread disease and facilitated exploitative labor to [[Encomienda|encomanderos]] and miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44964404|title=The Tepehuan Revolt of 1616 : militarism, evangelism and colonialism in seventeenth century Nueva Vizcaya|last=May)|first=Gradie, Charlotte M. (Charlotte|date=2000|publisher=University of Utah Press|year=|isbn=0874806224|location=Salt Lake City|pages=121|oclc=44964404}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt lasted from 1616 to 1620 with heavy casualties on both sides, during which time the Spanish abandoned their policy of "peace by purchase (tribute)" in favor of "war of fire and blood".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Soldiers, Indians, and Silver: The Northward Advance of New Spain, 1550–1600|last=Powell|first=Phillip W.|publisher=Berkeley: University of California Press|year=1952|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epidemics in Missions ===
With resistance and revolts, the native population dropped drastically with the introduction of Spanish missions. However, the main factor for the overwhelming losses were due to epidemics in the missions. Despite being affected before the introduction of missions, the buildings allowed rodents to infiltrate living areas and spread disease more rapidly. Many natives were living in cramped spaces with poor hygiene and poor nutrition. This led not only to high mortality rate, but to low fertility rates as well. It is estimated that every 20 years or so, a new epidemic would wipe out the adult population of natives in many missions, giving no chance for recovery. (Newson, 2005)

=== Cultural Changes ===
In converting natives, missionaries had to find various ways of implementing sacramental practices among them. Some [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]], like [[Baptism]], were already similar to the Nahuatl rituals during birth, usually performed by a midwife. Many missionaries even allowed for natives to keep some aspects of their original ritual in place, like giving the child or newborn a small arrowhead or broom to represent their future roles in society, as long as it complied with Catholic beliefs. Other sacraments, like [[Marriage|Matrimony]], were fairly different from native practices. Many natives were polygamous and to perform the sacrament of marriage, Franciscan monks would have a husband bring his many wives to the church, having them all state their reasons for being the one true wife. The monks would then decide based on the testimony who was his wife and perform the sacrament. (Reilly, 2016)

In addition to religious changes, Spanish missionaries also brought about secular changes. With each generation of natives, there was a gradual shift in what they ate, wore and how the economy within the missions worked. Missionaries introduced [[Adobe|adobe style houses]] for nomadic natives and domesticated animals for meat rather than wild game. The Spanish colonists also brought more foods and plants from Europe and South American to regions that initially had no contact with nations there. Natives began to dress in European-style clothing and adopted the Spanish language, often morphing it with Nahuatl and other native languages. (Jackson,1995)

== Catholic Orders ==

=== Franciscan ===

[[Franciscans|Franciscan]] missionaries were the first to arrive in New Spain, in 1523, following the Cortes expeditions in Mexico, and soon after began establishing missions across the continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53177965|title=Colonialism : an international social, cultural, and political encyclopedia|last=Page|first=Melvin E|date=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|others=Sonnenburg, Penny M.|year=|isbn=1576073351|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|pages=418|oclc=53177965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higham|first=Carol L.|date=9 May 2016|title=Christian Missions to American Indians|url=http://americanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-323|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-323}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their primary goal of spreading Christianity, the missionaries studied the native languages, taught children to read and write, and taught adults trades such as carpentry and ceramics. The first missionaries to arrive in the New World were Franciscan monks from the observant faction which believed in a strict and limited way of practicing religion. Because the monks believed teaching and practicing can only be done through "meditation and contemplation", Franciscans were not able to convert as many people as quickly as the Spanish would have liked. This caused strain between colonial governments and Franciscan friars, which eventually led to several of the friars fleeing to present day western Mexico and the dissolution of Franciscan parishes. Other issues also contributed to the dissolution of Franciscan parishes including the vow of poverty and accusations made by the colonial governments. However, Spanish missions often used money provided by the King to fund missions. Having monks taking money proved to be a controversial issue within the church. In addition, the colonial government claimed missionaries were mistreating indigenous people who were working on the missions. On the other hand, the Franciscan missionaries claimed that the Spanish government enslaved and mistreated indigenous people. Present day efforts are to show where Franciscan missionaries protected the indigenous people from Spanish cruelties and supported empowering the native peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwaller|first=John F.|date=October 2016|title=Franciscan Spirituality and Mission in New Spain, 1524–1599: Conflict Beneath the Sycamore Tree (Luke 19:1–10) by Steven E. Turley (review)|url=|journal=The Americas|volume=73:4|pages=520–522|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jesuits ===

The [[Jesuit]]s had a wide-spread impact between their arrival in the New World about 1570 until their expulsion in 1767. The Jesuits, especially in the southeastern part of South America, followed a widespread Spanish practice of creating settlements called "[[reductions]]" to concentrate the widespread native populations in order to better rule, Christianize, and protect the native populace.&lt;ref&gt;Caraman, Philip (1976), ''The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America'', New York: Seabury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuit Reductions were socialist societies in which each family would receive a house and field, and individuals were clothed and fed in return for work. Additionally, the communities would include schools, churches, and hospitals as well as native leaders and governing councils to be overseen by two Jesuit missionaries in each reduction. Like the Franciscans, the Jesuit missionaries learned the local languages and trained the adults in European methods of construction, manufacturing, and, to a certain extent, agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12688b.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Reductions of Paraguay|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish settlers were prohibited from living or working in reductions. This led to a strained relationship between Jesuit missionaries and the Spanish because in surrounding Spanish settlements people were not guaranteed food, shelter, and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bartolome-de-Las-Casas|title=Bartolome de Las Casas {{!}} Biography, Quotes, &amp; Significance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major Jesuit effort was that of [[Eusebio Kino]] [[Society of Jesus|S.J.]], in the region then known as the [[Pimería Alta]] – modern-day [[Sonora]] in [[Mexico]] and southern [[Arizona]] in the [[United States]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitaker|first=Arthur P.|date=1982|title=Rim of Christendom: A Biography of Eusebio Francisco Kino, Pacific Coast Pioneer Herbert Eugene Bolton Eusebio Francisco Kino|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3633889|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=6|issue=4|pages=381–383|doi=10.2307/3633889|issn=0030-8684|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominicans ===

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were centralized in the Caribbean and Mexico and, despite a much smaller representation in the Americas, had one of the most notable histories of native rights activism. [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] was the first Dominican bishop in Mexico and played a pivotal role in dismantling the practice of "encomenderos",these laws were intended to prevent the exploitation and mistreatment of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by the ''[[Encomienda|encomenderos]]'', by strictly limiting their power and dominion over groups of natives, with the establishment of the [[New Laws|New Laws in 1542]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bartolome-de-Las-Casas|title=Bartolome de Las Casas {{!}} Biography, Quotes, &amp; Significance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6582">'''Stan Steiner''' (1925–1987) was an [[United States|American]] [[historian]] and [[teacher]] who authored works generally focusing on American [[Minority group|minority communities]] and their relationship to the broader [[Society of the United States|U.S. society]] as well as the [[mythology]] of the [[American frontier]]. Born in the [[Coney Island]] area of [[New York, New York]], he wrote a number of books touching upon various subjects from the 1960s to 1980s. He expressed particular interest in [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American peoples]] and their [[History of Native Americans in the United States|complex history]] into the 20th century. As an instructor, he lectured at a variety of U.S. institutions, including the [[University of New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="Dead"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vanishing"/&gt;

==Life and career==
Although his writings became strongly associated with the American heartland, Steiner was born in the [[Coney Island]] area of [[New York, New York]]. After moving around in his early years, he underwent studies at the [[University of Wisconsin]].&lt;ref name="Dead"/&gt; His parents had [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated to the U.S.]] from the nation of [[Austria]].

Specific works by Steiner include ''The New Indians'' (1968), ''La Raza: The Mexican Americans'' (1970), ''The Vanishing White Man'' (1976), and ''The Ranchers: A Book of Generations'' (1980). As a professor, he notably taught at the [[University of New Mexico]]. He lectured at various other U.S. institutions as well.&lt;ref name="Dead"&gt;{{citenews|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/15/obituaries/stan-steiner-is-dead-at-62-author-consultant-teacher.html|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|title=Stan Steiner Is Dead at 62; Author, Consultant, Teacher|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1976 article on his then latest book by ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' remarked that it was "to Steiner's credit that he includes the testimony of other Western voices" regular readers studying the [[American frontier|U.S. frontier]] don't often hear, including "a Hopi elder, a thoughtful young Indian activist, a white Montana rancher, Senator Abourezk of South Dakota, Black Elk's granddaughter, and others." The analysis of ''The Vanishing White Man'', looking into the [[Culture|cultural contrast]] argument about modern U.S. citizens breaking the 'circle of life' cycle and connection to the land held by prior generations of [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous American peoples]], followed-up from similar observations made in his 1968 book that he titled ''The New Indians''.&lt;ref name="Vanishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/stan-steiner/the-vanishing-white-man/|title=The Vanishing White Man - By Stan Steiner|website=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same publication praised his later work ''The Ranchers: A Book of Generations''. In it, Steiner detailed the lives of a group of ranchers living in traditional fashion within several rural areas, the author going into the [[Individualism|individualist approaches]] aiming at maintaining self-sufficiency that the men and women had struggled with. Finding the "not sentimental" work still "sometimes moving", ''Kirkus Reviews'' declared, "As a composite picture of the vanishing rancher, the volume is [an] informative... [and] historically valuable antidote to the TV cowboy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/stan-steiner-3/the-ranchers-a-book-of-generations/|title=The Ranchers: A Book of Generations - By Stan Steiner|website=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner died of a [[heart attack]] in 1987 inside his home in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[New Mexico]]. He was 62 years old.&lt;ref name="Dead"/&gt; A collection of his essays was later put together in 1991 under the title ''The Waning of the West'', receiving acclaim from publications such as ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''. Writer [[John Nichols (novelist)|John Nichols]] composed the book's forward.&lt;ref name="Waning"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-03000-1|title=Nonfiction Book Review: ''The Waning of the West'' by Stan Steiner|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viewpoints==
Several years after the historian's death, ''Publishers Weekly'' remarked,
{{Quote|Concerned with the varied ethnic groups that contributed to the spirit of individualism, freedom and expansiveness... of the area, Steiner... [wrote] about Anglos, Hispanics, Navajos and the Chinese, who built many of the railroads. With the decline of the family farm and the virtual abandonment of many small towns, he saw the spirit of the West fading, although he believed that the legend of the region might live on.&lt;ref name="Waning"/&gt;}}

Earlier in his life, Steiner had been a caustic critic of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]], arguing that the administration had sold out national interests in the West to private efforts by [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref name="Vanishing"/&gt;

'''''The 300 Spartans''''' is a 1962 [[CinemaScope]] [[epic film]]&lt;ref&gt;Halliwell, Leslie, ''Halliwell’s Film Guide'', second edition, Granada, London, 1977 p. 881&lt;/ref&gt; depicting the [[Battle of Thermopylae]]. Made with the cooperation of the Greek government, it was shot in the village of [[Perachora]] in the [[Peloponnese]]. The [[working title]] was ''Lion of Sparta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/93100/The-300-Spartans/notes.html |title=The 300 Spartans (1962): Notes |publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] as the [[Sparta]]n king [[Leonidas I|Leonidas]],  [[Sir Ralph Richardson]] as [[Themistocles]] of [[Athens]] and [[David Farrar (actor)|David Farrar]] as [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] king [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], with [[Diane Baker]] as Ellas and [[Barry Coe]] as Phylon providing the requisite romantic element in the film.  Greek warriors, led by 300 Spartans, fight against a Persian army of almost limitless size.  Despite the odds, the Spartans will not flee or surrender, even if it means their deaths.

When it was released in 1962, critics saw the movie as a commentary on the [[Cold War]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Beam  | first = Alex | title=Meanwhile: Hot times at the 'Hot Gates'
| date=8 March 2007| publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/03/08/opinion/edbeam.php| accessdate = 2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  referring to the independent Greek states as "the only stronghold of freedom remaining in the then known world", holding out against the Persian "slave empire".

==Plot==
[[Xerxes I]] of Persia leads a vast army of soldiers into [[Europe]] to defeat the small city-states of [[Greece]], not only to fulfill the idea of "[[Autocracy|one world ruled by one master]]", but also to avenge the defeat of [[Darius I of Persia|his father]] at the [[Battle of Marathon]] ten years before. Accompanying him are [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]], the Queen of [[Halicarnassus]], who beguiles Xerxes with her feminine charm, and [[Demaratus]], an exiled king of [[Sparta]], to whose warnings Xerxes pays little heed.

In [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], [[Themistocles]] of [[Athens]] wins the support of the Greek allies and convinces both the delegates and the Spartan representative, [[Leonidas I]], to grant Sparta leadership of their forces. Outside the hall, Leonidas and Themistocles agree to fortify the pass at [[Thermopylae]] until the rest of the army arrives. After this, Leonidas learns of the Persian advance and travels to Sparta to spread the news.

In Sparta, his fellow king [[Leotychidas]] is fighting a losing battle with the [[Ephor]]s over the religious festival of [[Carnea]] that is due to take place, with members of the council arguing that the army should wait until after the festival is over before it marches, while Leotychidas fears that by that time the Persians may have conquered Greece. Leonidas decides to march north immediately with his personal bodyguard of 300 men, who are exempt from the decisions of the [[Ephor]]s and the [[Gerousia]]. They are subsequently reinforced by [[Thespiae|Thespians]] led by [[Demophilus of Thespiae|Demophilus]] and other Greek allies.

After several days of fighting, Xerxes grows angry as his army is repeatedly routed by the Greeks, with the Spartans in the forefront. Leonidas receives word that, by decision of the Ephors, the remainder of the Spartan army, rather than joining him as he had expected, will only fortify the [[Isthmus of Corinth|isthmus]] in the [[Peloponnese]] and will advance no further. The Greeks constantly beat back the Persians, and following the defeat of his [[Immortals (Persian Empire)|personal bodyguard]] in battle against the Spartans, Xerxes begins to consider withdrawing to [[Sardis]] until he can equip a larger force at a later date. As he prepares to withdraw, however, Xerxes receives word from the treacherous and avaricious [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] of a goat-track through the mountains that will enable his forces to attack the Greeks from the rear. Promising to reward Ephialtes for his betrayal, Xerxes sends his army onward.

Once Leonidas realizes he will be surrounded, he sends away the Greek allies to alert the cities to the south. Being too few to hold the pass, the Spartans instead attack the Persian front, where Xerxes is nearby. Leonidas is killed in the melée. Meanwhile, the Thespians, who had refused to leave, are overwhelmed (offscreen) while defending the rear. Surrounded, the surviving Spartans refuse Xerxes's demand to give up Leonidas' body. They are then annihilated by arrowfire.

After this, narration states that the [[Battle of Salamis]] and the [[Battle of Plataea]] end the Persian invasion, which could not have been organized without the time bought by the 300 Spartans who defied the tyranny of Xerxes at Thermopylae. One of the final images of the film is the memorial bearing the [[Battle of Thermopylae#Epitaph of Simonides|epigram of]] [[Simonides of Ceos]], which is recited.

==Production==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
The battle scenes were shot near the village of [[Perachora]], on the mainland side of the [[Corinth Canal]], as it was impossible to shoot at the actual location in [[Thermopylae]] where 2,500 years of [[silt]] has shrunk the [[Malian Gulf]] drastically since the battle in 480 B.C., turning the strait where the battle was fought into a broad coastal plain. The [[Ministry of National Defence (Greece)|Greek Ministry of National Defence]] agreed to make available to the producers up to 5,000 members of the [[Hellenic Army]] for a pre-negotiated fee. However, the film's budgetary constraints reduced the numbers drawn to only two battalions (approximately 1,100 men). For the largest establishing scenes—the Persian Army entering Greece—many of these soldiers, together with a combined total of several hundred civilian extras, horses, cattle, ox carts and chariots were utilized. For the wider establishing scenes of the battle, one battalion was retained to play both Greeks and Persians. For closer compositions of the fighting and encampments, military extras were called (call-sheeted) by company-size or smaller units, in meeting the specific needs of the day's shooting schedule. Director of Photography, Geoffrey Unsworth, made good use of the tree groves, which lined the coastal plain aside the ''Limni Vouliagmeni'' lagoon, to cover for the obvious deficiency in the number of troops that would have been amassed on the Persian-side of the battle line.

Originally developed as an Italian sword-and-sandal project, the cooperation and blessing of the [[Hellenic Armed Forces|Greek military]] and the [[Greek royal family|Hellenic Royal Family]] allowed producer, George St. George, to both finance and complete the production on a budget of 500,000 GBP (approximately, $1,350,000), roughly twice what most Italian peplum films were being made for at the time. ''The 300 Spartans'' was the last film of Richard Egan's seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. It was also the last film appearance of David Farrar, who then chose to retire from acting.

==Release==
Despite Cold War connotations the film was dubbed in Russian and it was shown in the USSR in 1970. The film was very popular there—27.1 million of viewers had seen it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinopoisk.ru/top/lists/184/film/64043/page/6/#film64043 Kinopoisk.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Myth of the Machine''''' is a two-volume book taking an in-depth look at the forces that have shaped modern [[technology]] since prehistoric times. The first volume, ''Technics and Human Development'', was published in 1967, followed by the second volume, ''The Pentagon of Power'', in 1970.  The author, [[Lewis Mumford]], shows the parallel developments between human tools and social organization mainly through language and rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Mumford (1970, 12).&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a synthesis of many theories Mumford developed throughout his prolific writing career. Volume 2 was a [[Book-of-the-Month Club]] selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~immer/books1970s | title=The Books of the Century, 1970-1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Megamachine==
"In ''The Myth of the Machine'', Mumford insisted upon the reality of the megamachine: the convergence of science, economy, technics and political power as a unified community of interpretation rendering useless and eccentric life-enhancing values. Subversion of this authoritarian kingdom begins with that area of human contact with the world that cannot be successfully repressed - one's feelings about one's self."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Freid, ''Makers of the City'', Univ Massachusetts Press, 1990. p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Prologue, Mumford defines his purpose here as "to question both the assumptions and the predictions upon which our commitment to the present forms of scientific and technical progress, treated as ends in themselves, have been based."

Mumford dates the emergence of the "Machine" from the pyramid age (primarily with reference to Egypt, but also acknowledging other ancient cultures in that era which produced massive and precisely engineered structures). He uses the term 'Megamachine'  to describe the social and bureaucratic structure that enabled a ruler to coordinate a huge workforce to undertake vast and complex projects. Where the projects were public works such as irrigation systems and canals or the construction of cities, Mumford referred to the "labour machine", and where they involved conquest he used the expression "military machine". The term "Megamachine" connoted the social structure in its entirety.

William Manson writes that Mumford differed from other major critics of technology in that "[Mumford] emphasized that the ultimate function of social structures ("society") should be to enhance individual development and mutually beneficial patterns of social cooperation.  Living in such conducive, humanly-scaled communities, individuals could develop their many-sided capacities (moral/empathic, cognitive, aesthetic, etc.).  Technical means, if limited to these human purposes and values, could enhance such growth and social well-being." &lt;ref&gt;Footnote: Manson writes that "this is a humanist vision shared also by such previous thinkers as [[W. von Humboldt]], [[J. S. Mill]], and even [[Karl Marx|Marx]] &amp; [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] ("the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all")."&lt;/ref&gt; Manson describes the dystopian vision of the future that Mumford warned of:
:"The beleaguered– even 'obsolete'–individual would be entirely de-skilled, reduced to a passive, inert, 'trivial accessory to the machine.'  Technical surveillance and limitless data-collection—'an all-seeing eye' (Panopticon)—would monitor every 'individual on the planet.  Ultimately, the totalitarian technocracy, centralizing and augmenting its 'power-complex,' ignoring the real needs and values of human life, might produce a world 'fit only for machines to live in'"&lt;ref name=CounterPunch-2014-03-21&gt;William Manson, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/03/21/homo-technomorphis/  Homo Technomorphis - The Relevance of Lewis Mumford], ''[[CounterPunch]]'', 2014.03.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume I, Technics and Human Development==
In this volume Mumford discusses the progress of terrestrial exploration, and scientific discovery; and traces the interplay of ideological interests, inventions and subjective drives in the evolution of human society. It expands upon the arguments he earlier promoted in ''[[Technics and Civilization]]'' (1934), and brings them up to date in the light of social developments in the intervening three decades. In the Preface he writes: "...I have been driven, by the wholesale miscarriage of megatechnics, to deal with the collective obsessions and compulsions that have misdirected our energies, and undermined our abilities to live full and spiritually satisfying lives."

==Volume II, The Pentagon of Power==
The "pentagon" refers to:
*Politics
*Power (in the sense of physical energy)
*Productivity
*Profit
*Publicity
There was clearly also an oblique reference to [[the Pentagon]], regarding which he commented: "...the concrete form of the Pentagon in Washington serves even better than its Soviet counterpart, the [[Kremlin]], as a symbol of totalitarian absolutism."

Although much of the volume explores the negative influence of centralised power and exploitative behaviour on the human condition, it finishes on a positive and optimistic note in the closing chapters. His final remark is:
:"But for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine, the next move is ours: for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically, despite their rusty ancient hinges, as soon as we choose to walk out."

William Manson writes that "Ultimately, Mumford advocated a negative revolt — resistance, refusal, withdrawal – whereby individuals may reclaim their autonomy and humanly-derived desires and choices."&lt;ref name=CounterPunch-2014-03-21/&gt;

'''Vasily Nikitich Tatishchev''' ({{lang-ru|Васи́лий Ники́тич Тати́щев}}) (April 19, 1686 – July 15, 1750) was a prominent [[Russia]]n statesman, and [[ethnographer]], best remembered as the author of the first full-scale Russian history and founder of three Russian cities: [[Tolyatti|Stavropol-on-Volga (now Tolyatti)]], [[Yekaterinburg]], and [[Perm]]. Throughout this work, he advocates the idea that [[autocracy]] is the perfect form of government for Russia.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Life==
A male-line descendant of the 9th-century prince [[Rurik]], Tatischev was born near [[Pskov]] on April 19, 1686. Having graduated from the Engineering school in [[Moscow]], he took part in the 1700-1721 [[Great Northern War]] with [[Sweden]]. In the service of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] he gained a prominent post in the [[Foreign Office]], which he used to oppose the policies of the [[Supreme Privy Council]] and support [[Anna of Russia|Anna]]'s ascension to the Russian throne in 1730. 

He was entrusted by Anna with a lucrative office of the management of [[Ural (region)|Ural]] factories. At that post he founded the cities of [[Perm]] and [[Yekaterinburg]], which have since grown into the veritable capitals of the Urals. A monument to him was opened in Perm in 2003. During the [[Bashkirs|Bashkir War of 1735-40]] he was in command of Siberian operations from the winter of 1736-37 and head of the whole operation from the spring of 1737.  He was removed from command after March 1739, nominally on charges of corruption, but mainly because he had made too many enemies. Tatischev finished his official career as a governor of [[Astrakhan]] (1741-44). He died at the Boldino estate near Moscow on July 15, 1750.

==Work==
Having retired from active service, the elderly statesman dedicated himself to scholarly pursuits. Feeling that the Russian [[historiography]] had been neglected, he discovered and published several legal monuments of great interest, e.g., [[Russkaya Pravda]] and [[Sudebnik]] of 1550. His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] was the first sketch of Russian history, entitled ''Russian History Dating Back to the Most Ancient Times'' and published in 5 volumes after his death. He also compiled the first encyclopedic [[dictionary]] of the [[Russian language]]. 

The scientific merits of Tatischev's work were disputed even in the 18th century. It is true that he used some chronicles that have since been lost, leading Iakov Lur'e to write of "Tatishchev Information," which he defined as "data unique to that historian,"&lt;ref&gt;Ia. S. Lur'e, "The Problem of Source Criticism (With Reference to Medieval Russian Documents)," ''Slavic Review'' Vol. 27, No. 1. (Mar., 1968), pp. 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; but most of them (notably the [[Ioachim Chronicle]]) were of dubious authenticity. It is also true that he could never tell a genuine work from a fake, and some incidents inserted in his history could have been products of his own fancy. Only recently some prominent historians have demonstrated that Tatischev's lost sources may actually be relied on.{{dubious|date=October 2014}}

==Memorialization==
A settlement and a [[Tatishchevsky District|district]] in [[Saratov Oblast]] are named after Tatishchev. There are monuments to Tatishchev in Perm and Yekaterinburg and in 1998 a [[Tatishchev Monument (Tolyatti)|large equestrian statue]] of Tatishchev was estasblished in Tolyatti.

'''William P. Leahy''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Society of Jesus|S.J.]]}} (born 1948) is the 25th [[list of Presidents of Boston College|President]] of [[Boston College]], a post he has held since 1996. He was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and raised in [[Imogene, Iowa]]. He joined the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1967, and is a member of the Jesuits' Wisconsin province. Leahy earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy and a master's degree in United States history at [[Saint Louis University]] in 1972 and 1975, respectively. He then began studies at the [[Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley]] in Berkeley, California, where he earned degrees in theology (1978) and historical theology (1980). He was ordained a priest in 1978. He received a doctoral degree in U.S. history from [[Stanford University]] in 1986.

He began his academic career as a teacher at [[Campion High School]] in Wisconsin from 1973 to 1975. He served as a teaching assistant at Stanford in 1981 before joining the [[Marquette University]] faculty as an instructor of history in 1985. He became an associate professor with tenure in 1991, and in that same year became Marquette's executive vice president.&lt;ref&gt;Boston College [http://www.bc.edu/about/message/s-message.html?_r=1&amp;hp "Father William P. Leahy, S.J. twenty-fifth president of boston college"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leahy's memberships include the [[American Catholic Historical Association]], the [[American Historical Association]], the History of Education Society, and the [[Organization of American Historians]].

==Boston College presidency==
===Achievements===
Since becoming Boston College president, Leahy has accelerated the growth and development of the university initiated by his predecessor [[J. Donald Monan]]. Boston College's [[financial endowment|endowment]] has continued to increase rapidly to more than $2 billion, making BC one of the 50 wealthiest universities in the nation. During the years after the global recession of 2008, Leahy's effective fiscal governance has enabled BC to emerge in a position of strength. BC had the fastest growing endowment of many high-ranking universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The 100 Richest Universities: Their Generosity and Commitment to Research| url = http://www.thebestschools.org/features/richest-universities-endowments-generosity-research/| accessdate =18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Leahy's presidency, the campus has expanded by almost 150&amp;nbsp;[[acre]]s (607,000&amp;nbsp;m²), and undergraduate applications have surpassed 30,000. At the same time, its students, faculty and athletic teams have seen unprecedented success — winning record numbers of [[Truman Scholarships|Truman]], [[Marshall Scholarships|Marshall]], [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]], [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes]] scholarships as well as other academic awards and research grants.

In 2006, after a two-year self-study involving more than 200 BC faculty, administrators, students and alumni, Leahy announced a $1.6-billion strategic plan that called for hiring 100 new faculty, adding a dozen new academic centers and spending $1 billion in construction and renovation projects to elevate Boston College to the highest echelon of premier national universities. The Plan set seven strategic directions for the University:  To become a national leader in liberal arts education and student formation; to enhance its research initiatives in select natural sciences and in areas that address urgent society problems; to support leadership initiatives in BC’s graduate and professional schools; to expand international programs and partnerships. Leahy's stated goal was to establish Boston College as "the world's leading Catholic university."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Boston College unveils 10-year, $1.6B expansion plan | url = http://www.southcoasttoday.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071204/NEWS/712040382/-1/rss36|date=4 December 2007 |website=SouthCoast Today| accessdate =18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this direction, the Weston Jesuit School of Theology re-affiliated with Boston College in 2008 to form the new [[Boston College School of Theology and Ministry|School of Theology and Ministry]]. During the same year, Leahy started the construction of Stokes Hall, a {{convert|183,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} administrative and classroom building for BC's humanities departments, which opened in 2012. Already in 2002, Leahy initiated the Church in the 21st Century program to examine issues facing the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in light of the clergy [[Catholic sex abuse cases|sexual abuse scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =BC is leading the way on Church reform | url =https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/126831701.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Jun%2019,%202002|last=Lehigh |first=Scot |date=19 June 2002 |website=Boston Globe Archives| accessdate = 18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In athletics, Boston College won conference and national titles during Leahy's presidency: for example four national [[Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey]] championships. In 2005, it left the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|Big East Conference]] and joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].

===Controversy===

Leahy's presidency has not been without controversy. He has fallen under much criticism for his inconsistent coherence to Boston College's Jesuit mission.

His Dean of Students declined to permit a dance sponsored by the BC gay and lesbian group, an event sponsored by the Boston College Woman's Health Initiative (pro-choice organization that is currently unrecognized by the university), and he has remained stalwart in his resistance to substantive changes to the university's policy toward groups that are contrary to Catholic teachings.

The move from the Big East to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] resulted in a lawsuit and editorializing by some Boston sports writers, though eventually BC won the lawsuits and membership in the ACC resulted in greater financial reward and national exposure for the athletic department. (ACC schools received an average of [[United States dollar|USD]] 10.85 million for the tax year ending June 30, 2006, Big East full members averaged a little more than half that at US $5,842,599.)&lt;ref&gt;Vingle, Mitch (27 May 2007). "Big East finances reveal rocky times of late". ''The Charleston Gazette''. {{cite web |url=http://sundaygazettemail.com/webtools/print/Sports/Mitch+Vingle/2007052621 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202617/http://sundaygazettemail.com/webtools/print/Sports/Mitch+Vingle/2007052621 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invitation of [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] to receive an honorary degree and deliver the 2006 Commencement Address evoked protest from a small number of the faculty members. While Rice received a standing ovation accompanied by extended applause at the 2006 Commencement Exercises, a small subset of faculty did turn their backs toward the stage as she was presented an honorary degree.
