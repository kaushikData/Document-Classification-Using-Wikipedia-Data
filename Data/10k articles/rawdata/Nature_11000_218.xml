'''{{mp|2017 YZ|1}}''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]] on an eccentric orbit, classified as [[near-Earth object]] and [[potentially hazardous asteroid]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]], approximately {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=off|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in diameter. It was first observed on 20 December 2017, by astronomers of the [[Mount Lemmon Survey]] at [[Mount Lemmon Observatory]] near Tucson, Arizona, in the United States.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;&lt;ref name=summary /&gt; On 29 January 2018, it passed Earth at 125 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

{{mp|2017 YZ|1}} is a member of the [[Apollo asteroid]]s, which [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|cross the orbit of Earth]]. Apollo's are the largest group of [[near-Earth objects]] with nearly 10 thousand known objects.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.88–1.77&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 18 months (559 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 1.33&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.33 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 21[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt;

== Risk assessment ==

The 9 January 2018 solution with a 15-day observation arc was listed at [[Torino scale]] 1 with a 1:21,000 chance of impacting Earth on 30 June 2047. By 9 January 2018, the geocentric 30 June 2047 uncertainty region had shrunk to ±50 million km. With a longer 20 day observation arc, it dropped to Torino scale 0 and had a 1:670,000 chance of impacting Earth on 30 June 2047.&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; On 18 January 2018 it was removed from the [[Sentry Risk Table]]. With a 28-day observation arc, the [[Curve fitting|nominal]] solution suggests it will be about {{cvt|0.25|AU|km}} from Earth on 30 June 2047. The [[3-sigma]] uncertainty in the 2047 close approach distance is about ±13 million km.

== Numbering and naming ==

This [[minor planet]] has neither been numbered nor [[List of named minor planets (alphabetical)|named]].&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;

'''Alfred de Grazia'''  (December 29, 1919 – July 13, 2014), born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], was a [[political scientist]] and author. He developed techniques of computer-based social network analysis in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;de Grazia, Alfred; Deutschmann, Paul; and Hunter, Floyd. [http://www.grazian-archive.com/governing/Elite/Table%20of%20Contents.html "Manual of Elite Target Analysis"] on the Alfred de Grazia website&lt;/ref&gt; developed new ideas about personal digital archives in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;de Grazia, Alfred de. [http://www.grazian-archive.com/projects/archvpt.html "The Personal Archive: On Retrieving Valuable Cultural Resources"] on the Alfred de Grazia website&lt;/ref&gt; and defended the [[catastrophism]] thesis of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]].

==Origins==
His father, Joseph Alfred de Grazia, was born in [[Licodia]], province of [[Catania]], in Sicily and was politically active in a troubled period in the history of the island. He emigrated to the United States at the age of twenty, after having hit the mayor of Licodia with his clarinet during a political scuffle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/walker/Documents/deGraziaNancy/DeGrazia_Nan_4FNL_RED.pdf |title="Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, oral history, interview of Nancy Shlaes de Grazia" |access-date=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010213239/https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/walker/Documents/deGraziaNancy/DeGrazia_Nan_4FNL_RED.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a bandmaster, music teacher, in and out of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/walker/Documents/deGraziaNancy/DeGrazia_Nan_4FNL_RED.pdf |title="Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library, oral history, interview of Nancy de Grazia" |access-date=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010213239/https://www.illinois.gov/alplm/library/collections/oralhistory/illinoisstatecraft/walker/Documents/deGraziaNancy/DeGrazia_Nan_4FNL_RED.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a musical union leader &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grazian-archive.com/autobiography/babe/BABE_09.htm "The Dad and his Music," in "The Babe," autobiography]&lt;/ref&gt; in Chicago. In 1916, he married Chicago-born Katherine Lupo Cardinale whose parents had emigrated from Sicily.

==Education==
De Grazia attended the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] there in 1939, attended law school at [[Columbia University]] from 1940–1941, and in 1948 earned a PhD in political science from the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt; His thesis was published in 1951 as ''Public and Republic: Political Representation in America''.  When reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]'' it was called  "A thoroughgoing examination of the meaning of representation, the fundamental element in any definition of republic."&lt;ref&gt;Binkley, W. E. ''[[The New York Times]]'' (August 26, 1951) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; and [[August Heckscher II|August Heckscher]] in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' said it was "A sober scholarly volume, authoritative in its field."&lt;ref&gt;[[August Heckscher II|Heckscher, August]] ''[[New York Herald Tribune|New York Herald Tribune Book Review]]'' (March 18, 1951) p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles E. Merriam]], founder of the behavioristic approach in political science, wrote: "All scholars in the field of political science and particularly those in the area of representation are under lasting obligation to the writer of this volume for a learned and helpful treatment of one of the major problems of our times. The book will enrich the literature on this very important subject."&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2717&amp;context=uclrev University of Chicago Law Review, Volume 18, Issue 4 (1951)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II, de Grazia served in the [[United States Army]], rising from private to captain.  He specialized in mechanized warfare, intelligence and [[psychological warfare]]. He received training in this then new field in Washington D.C. and the newly established Camp Ritchie in Maryland.&lt;ref name=propergander&gt;[https://docs.com/1DVHR ''The Proper Gander''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218134407/https://docs.com/1DVHR |date=February 18, 2015 }} magazine of the Psychological Operations Regiment at Fort Bragg, NC, Vol. 1, No. 1.

==Academic career==
De Grazia was [[assistant professor]] of [[political science]] at the [[University of Minnesota, Minneapolis]] from 1948 to 1950, before becoming [[associate professor]] of political science at [[Brown University]].&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt; In 1952, he was appointed to be Director of the Committee for Research in the Social Sciences at [[Stanford University]], supported by a [[Ford Foundation]] grant. He wrote the textbook ''The Elements of Political Science'' in two volumes: ''Political Behavior'' and ''Political Organization'' (1952).&lt;ref&gt;[http://prq.sagepub.com/content/5/3/539.extract# Ranking 47th of 161 in 2014, Journal Citation Reports (Thomson Reuters, 2015, 62 years after publication]&lt;/ref&gt;  One reviewer of it wrote: "Mr. De Grazia has undertaken to dissect the whole body of political science... He achieves his purpose with unfailing clarity, and his readers will learn from him the range, the goals, and the techniques of the study of politics..."&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Steven (Spring 1954) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3031442?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Review by Steven Muller], ''American Quarterly'' Vol. 6, No. 1, pp.88, 90-91)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, he was turned down for [[academic tenure]] at Stanford after doing a study of "the origins and present restrictions on the political activities of workers" for a foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lowen | first = Rebecca S. | title = Creating the Cold War university: the transformation of Stanford | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780520917903 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1959, he was professor of government and social theory at [[New York University]].&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;{{cite web | title = Contemporary Authors Online | url = http://gdc.gale.com/gale-literature-collections/contemporary-authors/# | publisher = Gale | date = 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Reproduced in {{cite web | title = Biography Resource Center | url = http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/BioRC | publisher = Gale | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | date = 2009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 de Grazia founded ''PROD: Political Research: Organization and Design'', which was described as "probably...the authentic spokesman for the newest currents among the ''avant-garde'' of political behavior".&lt;ref&gt;Dahl, Robert A. (December 1961) [http://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/PS671/Dahl_APSR1961.pdf "The Behavioral Approach in Political Science: Epitaph for a Monument to a Successful Protest"] in ''The American Political Science Review,'' Vol. 55, No. 4, pp.763-772.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later renamed ''The American Behavioral Scientist'', an academic journal devoted to the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] of [[behaviorist]] [[sociology]]. In 1965, he began the ''Universal Reference System,'' the first computerized reference system in the [[social science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Clifton | first = Brock | title = Political science | journal = [[Library Trends]] | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 628–647 | publisher = Illinois Digital Environment for Access for Learning and Scholarship (IDEALS), special issue: Bibliography: Current State and Future Trends, Part 2 | date = April 1967 | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2142/6341 | quote = | ref = harv }} [https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/6341/librarytrendsv15i4d_opt.pdf?sequence=1 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Grazia was a staunch supporter of the power of Congress against the encroachments of the Presidency, which he called the "Executive Force"&lt;ref&gt;Alfred de Grazia, ''Republic in Crisis: Congress against the Executive Force'' Federal Legal Publications, Inc. (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review by Cornelius Cotter, ''American Political Science Review'' Vol 60, Issue 03, September 1966 p723-724 [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8971939&amp;fileId=S0003055400130837]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raymond Tatalovich and [[Steven Schier]]:

{{quote|The thesis developed by Alfred de Grazia, coming in 1965 at the high-water mark of the Great Society, is that "the executive of the national government represents and leads the national movement towards a society of order. Congress ... expresses the national urge to liberty. ... Challenging the liberalism of academia, de Grazia doubts that the president can be the tribune of the people, and to call him the "custodian of the public interest or of the national interest is presumptuous," because he is custodian of ''a'' public interest, his own, and that may be popular or not, shared by Congress or not. When de Grazia speaks of the "problem of dictatorship," he is citing the growth of the executive apparatus. That is to say, "there is a dictator only because the bureaucratic state must have a face."{{parabr}}The civil service is viewed by de Grazia as "the great engine of the Executive Force," not Congress, because "Congress… is an institution deeply imbedded in federalism, the free enterprise system, and decentralization of society and politics. In represents basically these values." ...{{parabr}}Concerning both the "ends" and the "means" of government, Alfred de Grazia is a conservative. ... He is not troubled ... about "oligarchy and seniority" wielding disproportionate influence within the legislative process, because Congress operates principally through "the decision system of successive majorities." By that, de Grazia means that different majorities rule in subcommittees, committees, and the floor of each house of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Tatalovich, Raymond and [[Steven Schier|Schier, Steven]] (2014) ''The Presidency and political science: paradigms of presidential power from the founding to the present'' Routledge. p.130&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[American Enterprise Institute]] published several of his books on the subject, including ''Congress and the Presidency: their Role in Modern Times'', a debate with [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], who defended the case for a strong Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.|Schlesinger, Arthur M.]] and de Grazia, Alfred. (1967) ''Congress and the Presidency: their Role in Modern Times'' [[American Enterprise Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for Velikovsky==
[[File:Velikovsky and de Grazia.jpg|thumb|right|237px|de Grazia (right) and [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] in 1964]]

De Grazia became interested in [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]'s [[catastrophism|catastrophist]] theories. Following considerable criticism of Velikovsky's claims by the [[scientific community]], de Grazia dedicated the entire September 1963 issue of ''American Behavioral Scientist'' to the issue.&lt;ref name=Polanyi&gt;[[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi, Michael]] [http://www.polanyi.bme.hu/folyoirat/2006/2006_09_lecture4.pdf "Lecture 4: Myths, ancient and modern"], Lecture at University of Chicago Spring 1969. Polanyi archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Imre; [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend, Paul]] and [[Matteo Motterlini|Motterlini, Matteo]]. ''For and against method: including Lakatos's lectures on scientific method and the Lakatos-Feyerabend correspondence''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-46774-0}} {{ISBN|0-226-46775-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also self-published two books on it, ''The Velikovsky Affair: The Warfare of Science and Scientism'' and ''Cosmic Heretics: A Personal History of Attempts to Establish and Resist Theories of Quantavolution and Catastrophe in the Natural and Human Sciences''.

[[Michael Polanyi]] stated:

{{quote|A number of sociologists actually supported the popular view against the scientists. They came out first in ''The American Behavioral Scientist'' (September, 1963) and then again in a book (de Grazia 1966), which angrily attacked the whole community of natural scientists for paying no attention to Velikovsky. For my part I believe that the scientists were quite right in refusing to pay serious attention to Velikovsky's writings, and that the sociologists' attack on them was totally unfounded.&lt;ref name=Polanyi/&gt;}}

In a review of the second book, [[Henry Bauer]] suggests that de Grazia's efforts may be responsible for Velikovsky's continuing notability.&lt;ref name=skeptical&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Bauer| first = Henry H.| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Inside the Velikovsky Affair| journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]]| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 284–288| publisher = | location = | year = 1985| url = http://www.henryhbauer.homestead.com/DeGraziaReviewSI1985.pdf| issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both books de Grazia subscribes to the thesis that, in the words of Henry Bauer, "the affair revealed something seriously rotten in the state of science". The review however suggests that the rejection came about…

{{quote|because Velikovsky wanted instant recognition as ''the'' authority on science when he had no standing in any science, no qualifications, had not paid his dues through recognized achievements and presented his ideas in the form of a popularly published book rather than through technical articles.}}

The review further suggests that "de Grazia does not understand how the content of science is generated" and that his "understanding of science as a social activity is ambiguous."&lt;ref name=skeptical/&gt;

In the second book, de Grazia upholds Velikovsky's most general claim, that geologically recent (in the last 15,000 years) extraterrestrially-caused catastrophes occurred, and had a significant impact on the Earth and its inhabitants. De Grazia terms this belief "Quantavolution".&lt;ref name=skeptical/&gt;

==Later career==
In the early 1970s, de Grazia founded the "University of the New World" in [[Haute-Nendaz]] [[Switzerland]], as an unstructured alternative to American universities. He invited [[Beat generation|Beat]] author [[William S. Burroughs]] to teach at it. In his biography of Burroughs, [[Ted Morgan (writer)|Ted Morgan]] described the students that it attracted as "drifters and dropouts on the international hippie circuit"; he suggested that this resulted in a culture clash with the "prim Swiss", and that the university lacked adequate facilities or a sound business model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Morgan | first = Ted | authorlink= Ted Morgan (writer)| title = Literary Outlaw | publisher = Avon | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8050-0901-9 |pages= 453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, de Grazia was appointed visiting professor in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, Computing and Applications of the [[University of Bergamo]] in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unibg.it/struttura/en_struttura.asp?rubrica=1&amp;persona=1508&amp;nome=Alfred&amp;cognome=De%20Grazia&amp;titolo=Prof. unibg.it Staff entry]&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been a visiting lecturer at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], the [[University of Bombay]], the [[University of Istanbul]], and the [[University of Gothenburg]] in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt;

==Personal life==
Alfred de Grazia was married to Jill Oppenheim (d. 1996) from 1942 to 1971, to Nina Mavridis from 1972 to 1973,&lt;ref name=Gale/&gt; and from 1982 to his death to Anne-Marie (Ami) Hueber - de Grazia, a French writer &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grazian-archive.com/governing/bhopal/Publishers%20Note.html "Publisher's Note"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826042312/http://www.grazian-archive.com/governing/bhopal/Publishers%20Note.html |date=2009-08-26 }} on the Alfred de Grazia website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Grazia, Alfred (1984).

He had seven children with Jill Oppenheim. One of them, Carl, a musician, died in 2000. One of his daughters, Victoria de Grazia, a Professor of Contemporary History at [[Columbia University]], is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences|American Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2005/0511/0511new3.cfm "Ten Historians are elected to the American Academy"]  [[American Historical Association]] (November 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Aquaman''''' is a 2018 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Aquaman|of the same name]], distributed by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]]. It is the sixth installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU). Directed by [[James Wan]], with a screenplay by [[David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick]] and [[Will Beall]], from a story by [[Geoff Johns]], Wan and Beall, it stars [[Jason Momoa]] as the title character, with [[Amber Heard]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] in supporting roles. It is the third live-action theatrical film featuring the title character, following ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) and ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]'' (2017) and the first full-length feature film centered around the character. In ''Aquaman'', Arthur Curry, the heir to the underwater kingdom of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]], must step forward to lead his people against his half-brother, [[Ocean Master|Orm]], who seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms against the surface world.

Development of an Aquaman film began in 2004, with several plans falling through over the years. In August 2014, Beall and [[Kurt Johnstad]] were hired to write two competing scripts and the film was officially announced in October 2014. Wan signed on as director in April 2015 and in July 2016 it was announced the film would move forward with Beall's screenplay, although Wan, Johnstad, Johns and Johnson-McGoldrick all performed various rewrites. The main cast was confirmed throughout 2016 and early 2017. [[Principal photography]] began in Australia on May 2, 2017. Most of the film was shot at [[Village Roadshow Studios]] in [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], with production also held in [[Canada]], [[Italy]] and [[Morocco]], and wrapped on October 21, 2017.

''Aquaman'' had its world premiere in London on November 26, 2018, and is scheduled to be released in the United States by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in [[Real D 3D]], [[Dolby Cinema]], [[IMAX]] and [[IMAX 3D]] on December 21, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2018-11-13|title='Aquaman' Red Carpet London Premiere Date Revealed|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/10/29/aquaman-movie-london-red-carpet-premiere/|newspaper=DC|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029175200/https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/10/29/aquaman-movie-london-red-carpet-premiere/#|archive-date=2018-10-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Pierce established an agricultural college and attracted ''remittance men'' as students for £100 a year.  The intention of the college was to instruct these bachelor sons of wealthy families to farm and homestead in the last best west.  The brothers Ernest, Billy and Bertie Beckton constructed "Didsbury", ranch house within Cannington Manor colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The cultural and recreational life emulated English upper class society. Thoroughbred racing, polo matches, theatrical plays, [[fox hunting]], billiards, soccer and tennis were all enjoyed by the colony students and settlers.  This was a contrast to the neighbouring homesteaders who were barely eking out a living proving their land and making improvements to earn land title grants from the Dominion Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Demise of Colony==

Captain Pierce, the founder of the community died on June 20, 1888. C.E. Phipps established the land titles office here in 1889 and moved to [[Oxbow, Saskatchewan|Oxbow]] in 1891. Spencer Page was the colony's first teacher in 1889 before turning to politics in 1894. Louis Kent the second teacher in Cannington Manor started his duties in 1894 and passed on in 1896.  Robert Bird the Moose Mountain trading company store keeper moved to B.C. in 1898.   Ernest Maltby postmaster and his wife Mary arrived in 1892 moved in 1901 to B.C. 

In 1901 - 1902 the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] regional branch line was constructed {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the village rather than through the village.  During a time of travel by horseback this distance was detrimental to the growth of the community.  The passing of the founder, a few years earlier, a drought and low grain prices soon made it unfeasible for settlers to continue the lifestyle at Cannington Manor.&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;

[[File: Alter Peter &amp; Christkindlmarkt.jpg|thumb|upright| Seen from the Rathausturm]]
The '''Christkindlmarkt at Marienplatz''' is a [[Christmas market]] at [[Marienplatz]] in [[Munich]].

== History ==
The largest and oldest Christmas market in Munich was first documented as a Nikolaimarkt ([[Saint Nicholas|Nikolausmarkt]]) in 1310, making it one of the oldest Christmas markets in the German-speaking world. In 1806, the Nikolaimarkt was renamed the Christmarkt. Since 1972, the market has found its place of business on the Marienplatz after several changes of location. Over the last few years, the exhibition area has been extended considerably (e.g. Rindermarkt). The organizer is the cultural office of the city administration. 

== Description ==
[[File: Krippermarkt_München_2016.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kripperlmarkt]]
With around 140 market stands, it now has around three million visitors every year from all over the world. In addition to the extensive musical-cultural accompanying program, the almost 30-meter-high [[Christmas tree]] in front of the [[New Town Hall (Munich)|town hall]], with around 2,500 lights, is donated every year to the citizens of Munich by a different town from [[Austria]] or [[Italy]]. As a reward for the gift, the municipality can present itself in the inner courtyard of the town hall and operate a [[Mulled wine|Glühwein]] stand. The high interest of non-municipal communities for this in this self-presentation position, forced the organizers to create a multi-faceted waiting list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ganz-muenchen.de/freizeitfitness/weihnachten/2009/tanne_aus_samerberg.html | title=Ein Tanne für den Münchner Christkindlmarkt: Der Christbaum 2009 für den Marienplatz kommt aus Samerberg | author= | date=16 November 2009 | website=ganz-muenchen.de | publisher= | language=German | accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market is usually open daily from the Friday before the first [[Advent]] Sunday, until [[Christmas Eve]].

To the west of the Marienplatz, in the direction of [[Karlsplatz (Stachus)|Stachus]], is the so-called [[Nativity scene|Kripperlmarkt]]. More than ten stands around the Richard Strauss fountain in the Neuhauserstraße offer only Nativity scenes, figures, and other accessories. There are also some market stands offering food and drinks.
The Kripperlmarkt in the Munich pedestrian zone is open daily and also closes on 24 December (Christmas Eve) at 2 pm.

Five descriptive terms describe the progressive interactions that can occur in a clay-water system, such as a water mud.

(1) [[Mineral hydration|Hydration]] occurs as clay packets absorb water and swell.

(2) [[Dispersion (chemistry)|Dispersion]] (or disaggregation) causes clay platelets to break apart and disperse into the water due to loss of attractive forces as water forces the platelets farther apart.

(3) [[Flocculation]] begins when mechanical shearing stops and platelets previously dispersed come together due to the attractive force of surface charges on the platelets.

(4) [[Peptization|Deflocculation]], the opposite effect, occurs by addition of chemical deflocculant to flocculated mud; the positive edge charges are covered and attraction forces are greatly reduced.

(5) [[Particle aggregation|Aggregation]], a result of ionic or thermal conditions, alters the hydrational layer around clay platelets, removes the deflocculant from positive edge charges and allows platelets to assume a face-to-face structure.

'''Clinton Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] located on the coastline at the north end of [[Gulf St Vincent]] in [[South Australia]]. The conservation park consists of two parts with the first extending from [[Clinton, South Australia|Clinton]] on [[Yorke Peninsula]] on the west side of Gulf St Vincent to [[Port Wakefield, South Australia|Port Wakefield]] on the east side of the gulf and the second extending south of Port Wakefield to Sandy Point. The conservation park which was originally proclaimed in 1970, was re-proclaimed under the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]''.  The area contained within the conservation park including the ‘head of gulf wetland and Wakefield River estuary’ is considered to be ‘important as a fish nursery and a significant site for migratory wading birds’.  The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category III — Natural Monument or Feature|Category III protected area]].&lt;ref name=gazateer&gt;{{Gazetteer of Australia|name= Clinton Conservation Park |feature= SA0014407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainland Conservation Parks of Yorke Peninsula Management Plan 2009|url=http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/40ccb65e-c97a-4f04-af74-9e4f00b16e48/mainland-cps-of-yp-mp.pdf|publisher=Department for Environment and Heritage|accessdate=15 July 2014|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum&gt;{{cite web|title=CAPAD 2012 South Australia Summary (see 'DETAIL' tab)|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/pages/0f927a4e-336a-490c-a896-ec37874a5c73/files/capad2012sa.xlsx|work=CAPAD 2012|publisher=Australian Government - Department of the Environment|accessdate=6 February 2014|date=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cob wall mud construction.jpg|upright|thumb|Building a wall out of cob.]]
'''Cob''',  '''cobb''' or '''clom''' (in Wales) is a [[natural building]] material made from [[subsoil]], water, fibrous [[organic material]] (typically [[straw]]), and sometimes [[Lime (material)|lime]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Joseph. "COB(B, sb3. 1.", ''The English Dialect Dictionary, Being the Complete Vocabulary of All Dialect Words Still in Use, or Known to Have Been in Use during the Last Two Hundred Years''. London: H. Frowde;, 1898. 676-677. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The contents of subsoil naturally vary, and if it does not contain the right mixture it can be modified with sand or clay. Cob is fireproof, resistant to seismic activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goodnow|first=Cecelia|title=Thinking of building a cob home?|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/article/Thinking-of-building-a-cob-home-1251753.php|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inexpensive.  It can be used to create artistic, sculptural forms, and its use has been revived in recent years by the natural building and [[sustainability]] movements.

In technical building and engineering documents such as the [[Uniform Building Code]], cob may be referred to as an "unburned clay masonry" when used in a structural context. It might also be referred to as an "aggregate" in non-structural contexts, such as a "clay and sand aggregate" or more simply an "organic aggregate," such as where the cob is an insulating filler between [[Timber framing|post and beam]] construction.

==History and usage==
[[File:Cob stitch copy.jpg|thumb|'Cob stitch' repair on old traditional cob cottage in [[Devon]], England]]
''Cob'' is an English term attested to around the year 1600&lt;ref&gt;"cob, n2. 1." ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-rom.&lt;/ref&gt; for an ancient building material that has been used for building since prehistoric times. The etymology of ''cob'' and ''cobbing'' is unclear, but in several senses means to ''beat'' or ''strike'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cob|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cob|website=Collins English Dictionary|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=13 January 2017|quote=verb: ''(transitive) British informal'' to beat, esp on the buttocks}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is how cob material is applied to a wall.

Some of the oldest man-made structures in Afghanistan are composed of [[rammed earth]] and cob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McArdle |first=Patricia |title=Afghanistan’s Last Locavores |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/20/opinion/20mcardle.html?_r=2 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobwork (''tabya'') was used in the [[Maghreb]] and [[al-Andalus]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, and was described in detail by [[Ibn Khaldun]] in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Routledge Hill |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Routledge Hill |editor1-last=Rashed |editor1-first=Roshdi |editor2-last=Morelon |editor2-first=Régis |year=1996 |chapter=Engineering |title=Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science |volume=3 |isbn=0-415-02063-8 |page=766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cob material is known by many names including ''[[adobe]]'',&lt;ref name=Rapp&gt;Rapp, George Robert. "Unbaked clay or mud", ''Archaeomineralogy''. 2nd ed. Berlin: Springer, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; ''lump clay'',&lt;ref name=Rapp/&gt; ''[[Puddling (engineering)|puddled]] clay'', ''chalk mud'',&lt;ref name=Rapp/&gt; ''[[wichert]]'',&lt;ref name=Rapp/&gt; ''clay daubins'',&lt;ref name=Rapp/&gt; ''swish'' ([[Asante Twi]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Paul|last2=Hess|first2=Janet B.|title=African architecture|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/African-architecture#ref519949|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=13 January 2017|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''torchis'' (French),&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Edwards, Jay Dearborn, and Nicolas Verton.

Cob structures can be found in a variety of climates across the globe. European examples include:

* in England, notably in the counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in the [[West Country]], and in [[East Anglia]] (where it is referred to as ''clay lump'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bouwens|first1=Dirk|title=Earth Buildings and Their Repair|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com|website=www.buildingconservation.com|publisher=Cathedral Publications Ltd.|accessdate=13 January 2017}} ''[reproduced from The Building Conservation Directory, 1997]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]] and [[Gower Peninsula]] in Wales{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* in [[Donegal Bay]] in [[Ulster]] and in Munster, South-West [[Ireland]]{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}
* in [[Finistère|Finisterre]] in [[Brittany]], where many homes have survived over 500 years and are still inhabited{{citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Many old cob buildings can be found in [[Africa]], the Middle East, and many parts of the southwestern United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} A number of cob cottages survive from mid-19th-century New Zealand.&lt;ref name=NZHPT&gt;Dozens of cob cottages are [http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/SearchResults.aspx?s=s&amp;NameOrID=cob listed on the Register] of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, e.g. {{cite web|title=Ferrymead Cob Cottage|url=http://www.historic.org.nz/TheRegister/RegisterSearch/RegisterResults.aspx?RID=3101|work=Rarangi Taonga: the Register of Historic Places, Historic Areas, Wahi Tapu and Wahi Tapu Areas|publisher=New Zealand Historic Places Trust Pouhere Taonga|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, English cob was made by mixing the clay-based subsoil with sand, straw and water using [[oxen]] to trample it. English soils contain varying amounts of [[chalk]], and cob made with significant amounts of chalk are called ''chalk cob'' or ''[[wychert]]''. The earthen mixture was then ladled onto a stone [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] in [[Course (architecture)|courses]] and trodden onto the wall by workers in a process known as ''cobbing''. The construction would progress according to the time required for the prior course to dry. After drying, the walls would be trimmed and the next course built, with lintels for later openings such as doors and windows being placed as the wall takes shape.&lt;ref name="SnellCallahan2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=Snell |last2=Tim |first2=Callahan |title=Building Green: A Complete How-to Guide to Alternative Building Methods : Earth Plaster, Straw Bale, Cordwood, Cob, Living Roofs |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=gGEbRyok6f0C&amp;pg=PA276 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |isbn=978-1-60059-534-9 |pages=276–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The walls of a cob house are generally about {{convert|24|in|cm}} thick, and windows were correspondingly deep-set, giving the homes a characteristic internal appearance. The thick walls provided excellent thermal mass which was easy to keep warm in winter and cool in summer. Walls with a high thermal mass value act as a thermal buffer inside the home.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Goodhew |first1=Steven |last2=Griffiths |first2=Richard

&lt;/ref&gt;
The material has a long life-span even in rainy and/or humid climates, provided a tall foundation and large roof overhang are present.

Cob is fireproof, while "fire cob" (cob without straw or fiber) is a refractory material (the same material, essentially, as unfired common red brick), and historically, has been used to make chimneys, fireplaces, forges and crucibles. Without fiber, however, cob loses most of its tensile strength.

[[File:Beautifying cob oven.jpg|thumb|250px|Decorating a cob oven]]When Kevin McCabe constructed a two-story, four bedroom cob house in [[England]], [[UK]] in 1994, it was reputedly the first cob residence built in the country in 70 years. His techniques remained very traditional; the only innovations he made were using a [[tractor]] to mix the cob and adding sand or shillet, a gravel of crushed [[shale]], to reduce shrinkage.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

[[File:The Cob House - Cadhay.jpg|thumb|left|A modern cob house near [[Ottery St Mary]], [[United Kingdom]]]] From 2002 to 2004, sustainability enthusiast [[Rob Hopkins]] initiated the construction of a cob house for his family, the first new one in [[Ireland]] in circa one hundred years. It was a community project, but an unidentified [[arsonist]] destroyed it shortly before completion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transitionculture.org/about/ Practical Sustainability: About]&lt;/ref&gt; The house, located at The Hollies Centre for Practical Sustainability in [[County Cork]], was being rebuilt as of 2010. There are a number of other completed modern cob houses and more are planned, including a public education centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Welcome to The Hollies |url=http://thehollies.ie |title=The Hollies |publisher=thehollies.ie |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000-01, a modern, four bedroom cob house in [[Worcestershire]], [[England]], [[UK]], designed by Associated Architects, was sold for [[Pound sterling|£]]999,000. Cobtun House was erected in 2001 and won the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' Sustainable Building of the Year award in 2005. The total construction cost was £300,000, but the metre-thick outer cob wall cost only £20,000.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In the Pacific Northwest of the [[United States]] there has been a resurgence of cob construction, both as an alternative building practice and one desired for its form, function, and cost effectiveness. Pat Hennebery, Tracy Calvert, Elke Cole, and the Cobworks workshops erected more than ten cob houses in the Southern [[Gulf Islands]] of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In 2010, Sota Construction Services in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]] completed construction on its new 7,500 square foot corporate headquarters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sotaconstruction.com/project_details.asp?id=42 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017204416/http://www.sotaconstruction.com/project_details.asp?id=42 |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured exterior cob walls along with other energy saving features like radiant heat flooring, a rooftop solar panel array, and [[daylighting]]. The cob walls, in conjunction with the other sustainable features, enabled the edifice to earn a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Platinum rating in 2012, and it also received one of the highest scores by percentage of total points earned in any LEED category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usgbc.org/projects/sota-construction-office-expansion&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Ann and Gord Baird began constructing a two-storey cob house in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] for an estimated $210,000 CDN.  The home of 2,150 square feet includes heated floors, solar panels, and a southern exposure to enable [[passive solar heating]].&lt;ref name="Indy2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/a-dream-home-made-of-mud/article1079750/|title=A Dream Home Made of Mud|last=Barton|first=Adriana|date=3 August 2007|work=|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|via=|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welsh architect [[Ianto Evans]] and researcher Linda Smiley refined the construction technique known as "Oregon Cob" in the 1980s and 1990s. Oregon Cob integrates the variation of wall layup technique which uses loaves of mud mixed with sand and straw with a rounded architectural stylism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkearth.org/naturalbuilding/history.html The History of Cob]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternativesmagazine.com/17/kemery.html Building with Oregon Cob]&lt;/ref&gt; They are experimenting with a mixture of cob and straw bale denominated "[[balecob]]".

== Themes ==
{{Original research|date=October 2012}}
In ''Das Kapital'' (1867), Marx proposes that the motivating force of [[capitalism]] is in the [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of [[labour (economics)|labor]], whose unpaid work is the ultimate source of [[surplus value]]. The [[employer|owner of the means of production]] is able to claim the right to this surplus value because he or she is legally protected by the [[capitalist state|ruling regime]] through [[property rights]] and the legally established distribution of [[Share (finance)|shares]] which are by law only to be distributed to company owners and their board members. The historical section shows how these rights were acquired in the first place chiefly through plunder and conquest and the activity of the merchant and "middle-man". In producing [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (produced goods), the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour. ''Capital'' proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the capitalist economic system, from its origins to its future, by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, the growth of [[wage labour]], the transformation of the workplace, the concentration of capital, commercial competition, the [[banking]] system, the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|decline of the profit rate]], land-rents, ''et cetera''.

The critique of the political economy of capitalism proposes that:
* Wage-labour is the basic "cell-form" (trade unit) of a capitalist society. Moreover, because commerce as a human activity implied no [[Ethics|morality]] beyond that required to buy and sell goods and services, the growth of the market system made discrete entities of the economic, the moral and the legal spheres of human activity in society; hence, subjective [[moral value]] is separate from objective economic value. Subsequently, [[political economy]]—the just [[distribution of wealth]] and "political arithmetick" about taxes—became three discrete fields of human activity: [[economics]], [[law]] and [[ethics]], politics and economics divorced.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}
* "The economic formation of society [is] a process of natural history". It is thus possible for a [[Political economy|political economist]] to objectively study the scientific laws of capitalism, given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had [[Objectification|objectified]] human economic relations; the use of [[money]] (cash nexus) voided religious and political illusions about its [[Theory of value (economics)|economic value]] and replaced them with [[commodity fetishism]], the belief that an object (commodity) has inherent economic value. Because societal economic formation is a historical process, no one person could control or direct it, thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The economic formation (individual commerce) of a society thus precedes the human administration of an economy (organised commerce).
* The structural contradictions of a capitalist economy, the ''gegensätzliche Bewegung'', describe the contradictory movement originating from the two-fold character of labour and so the [[class struggle]] between [[Labour (economics)|labour]] and [[capitalism|capital]], the [[wage labour]]er and the [[Bourgeoisie|owner]] of the [[means of production]]. These capitalist economic contradictions operate "behind the backs" of the capitalists and the workers as a result of their activities and yet remain beyond their immediate [[perception]]s as men and women and as [[social class]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl. ''Capital'': The Process of Capitalist Production. 3d German edition (tr.), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The economic crises ([[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], ''et cetera'') that are rooted in the contradictory character of the economic value of the commodity (cell-unit) of a capitalist society are the conditions that propitiate [[Proletariat|proletarian]] [[revolution]]—which ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' (1848) collectively identified as a weapon, forged by the capitalists, which the working class "turned against the [[bourgeoisie]], itself".
* In a capitalist economy, [[technology|technological]] improvement and its consequent increased production augment the amount of [[Wealth|material wealth]] ([[use value]]) in society while simultaneously diminishing the [[Value (economics)|economic value]] of the same wealth, thereby [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|diminishing the rate of profit]]—a [[paradox]] characteristic of economic crisis in a capitalist economy. "Poverty in the midst of plenty" consequent to over-production and under-consumption.

After two decades of economic study and preparatory work (especially regarding the theory of [[surplus value]]), the first volume appeared in 1867 as ''The Production Process of Capital''. After Marx's death in 1883, from manuscripts and the first volume Engels introduced Volume II: ''The Circulation Process of Capital'' in 1885; and Volume III: ''The Overall Process of Capitalist Production'' in 1894. These three volumes are collectively known as ''Das Kapital''.

== Synopsis ==
=== ''Capital. Volume I'' ===
''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (1867) is a critical analysis of political economy, meant to reveal the contradictions of the capitalist mode of production, how it was the precursor of the [[socialist mode of production]] and of the [[class struggle]] rooted in the capitalist social relations of production. The first of three volumes of ''Das Kapital. Kritik der politischen Ökonomie'' (''Capital. Critique of Political Economy'') was published on 14 September 1867, dedicated to [[Wilhelm Wolff]] and was the sole volume published in Marx’s lifetime.

=== ''Capital. Volume II'' ===
''[[Capital, Volume II]]'', subtitled ''The Process of Circulation of Capital'', was prepared by Engels from notes left by Marx and published in 1885. It is divided into three parts: ''The Metamorphoses of Capital and Their Circuits'', ''The Turnover of Capital'' and ''The Reproduction and Circulation of the Aggregate Social Capital''.  In ''Volume II'', the main ideas behind the marketplace are to be found: how value and surplus-value are realized. Its dramatis personae are not so much the worker and the industrialist (as in ''Volume I''), but rather the money owner (and money lender), the wholesale merchant, the trader and the entrepreneur or functioning capitalist. Moreover, workers appear in ''Volume II'', essentially as buyers of consumer goods and therefore as sellers of the commodity labour power, rather than producers of value and surplus-value—though this latter quality, established in ''Volume I'', remains the solid foundation on which the whole of the unfolding analysis is based. Reading ''Volume II'' is of monumental significance to understanding the theoretical construction of Marx's whole argument. Marx himself quite precisely clarified this place in a letter sent to Engels on 30 April 1868: "In Book 1... we content ourselves with the assumption that if in the self-expansion process £100 becomes £110, the latter will find already in existence in the market the elements into which it will change once more. But now we investigate the conditions under which these elements are found at hand, namely the social intertwining of the different capitals, of the component parts of capital and of revenue (= s)". This intertwining, conceived as a movement of commodities and of money, enabled Marx to work out at least the essential elements, if not the definitive form, of a coherent theory of the trade cycle, based upon the inevitability of periodic disequilibrium between supply and demand under the capitalist mode of production (Mandel, 1978, ''Introdution to Volume II of Capital''). ''Volume II'' of ''Capital'' has indeed been not only a sealed book, but also a forgotten one. To a large extent, it remains so to this very day. Part 3 is the point of departure for a [[topic (linguistics)|topic]] given its Marxist treatment later in detail by [[Rosa Luxemburg]], among others.

=== ''Capital. Volume III'' ===
''[[Capital, Volume III]]'', subtitled ''The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole'', was prepared by Friedrich Engels from notes left by Karl Marx and published in 1894. It is in seven parts:
# The conversion of Surplus Value into [[Profit (economics)|Profit]] and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit
# Conversion of Profit into Average Profit
# The Law of the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall]]
# Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital)
# Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital.
# Transformation of Surplus-Profit into Ground [[Economic rent|Rent]].
# Revenues and Their Sources
The work is best known today for Part 3, which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the [[rate of profit]] tends to fall. This result, which [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxists]] believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order, was held by Marx and Engels to—as a result of various contradictions in the capitalist [[mode of production]]—result in [[Crisis theory|crises]] whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new mode of production as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of capitalism from prior forms.

== Intellectual influences ==
The purpose of ''Das Kapital'' (1867) was a scientific foundation for the politics of the modern [[labour movement]]. The analyses were meant "to bring a [[Political economy|science]], by criticism, to the point where it can be [[Dialectics|dialectically]] represented" and so "reveal the law of motion of modern society"{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} to describe how the capitalist mode of production was the precursor of the socialist mode of production. The argument is a critique of the classical economics of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and [[Benjamin Franklin]], drawing on the [[dialectic]]al method that [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]] developed in ''[[Science of Logic]]'' and ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''; other intellectual influences on ''Capital'' were the French socialists [[Charles Fourier]], [[Comte de Saint-Simon]], [[Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]; and the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]], especially [[Aristotle]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

At university, Marx wrote a dissertation comparing the [[philosophy of nature]] in the works of the philosophers [[Democritus]] (circa 460–370 BC) and [[Epicurus]] (341–270 BC). The logical architecture of ''Das Kapital'' is derived in part from the ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' and the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' by Aristotle, including the fundamental distinction between [[use value]] and [[exchange value]],&lt;ref&gt;Marx credits Aristotle for being the "first to analyze... the form of value." In addition, he identifies the categories of use and exchange value with the Aristotlean distinction between the ''Oeconomic'' and the ''Chrematisitic''.  In the ''Politics'', the former is defined as "value in use," while the latter is defined as a practice in which exchange value becomes an end unto itself."Marx, ''Capital'' Vol. 1, trans. Ben Fowkes (New York: Knopf Doubleday, 1977), 68, 253, f. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[syllogisms]]" ([[C-M-C']] and [[M-C-M']]) for simple commodity circulation and the circulation of [[Value (economics)|value]] as [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref&gt;see Meikle, Scott, ''Aristotle's Economic Thought'' (London: Clarendon Press, 1997) and McCarthy, George, ''Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity'' (New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the description of [[machinery]], under capitalist relations of production, as "self-acting [[automata]]" derives from Aristotle’s speculations about inanimate instruments capable of obeying commands as the condition for the abolition of [[slavery]]. In the nineteenth century, Marx’s research of the available politico-economic literature required twelve years, usually in the [[British Library]], London.&lt;ref&gt;''Capital'', Vol. 1, trans. Fowkes (Knopf Doubleday, 1977), 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of his death (1883), Marx had prepared the manuscript for ''Das Kapital, Volume IV'', a critical history of theories of [[surplus value]] of his time, the nineteenth century. The philosopher [[Karl Kautsky]] (1854–1938) published a partial edition of Marx's surplus-value critique and later published a full, three-volume edition as ''Theorien über den Mehrwert'' (''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', 1905–1910). The first volume was published in English as ''A History of Economic Theories'' (1952).&lt;ref&gt;''Columbia Encyclopedia'', Fifth Edition (1994) p. 1707.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (1867) was published in Marx’s lifetime, but he died in 1883 before completing the manuscripts for ''[[Capital, Volume II]]'' (1885) and ''[[Capital, Volume III]]'' (1894), which friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels edited and published as the work of Marx. The first translated publication of ''Das Kapital'' was in [[Russian history, 1892–1917|Imperial Russia]] in March 1872. It was the first foreign publication and the English edition appeared in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Ostler, Nicholas. ''Empires of the Word: A Language History of the World''. HarperCollins: London and New York, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Tsarism|Tsarist]] [[censorship]] proscribing "the harmful doctrines of [[socialism]] and [[communism]]", the Russian censors considered ''Capital'' as a "strictly scientific work" of [[political economy]] the content of which did not apply to [[Absolute monarchy|monarchic]] Russia, where "capitalist [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]]" had never occurred and was officially dismissed, given "that very few people in [[Russian history, 1892–1917|Russia]] will read it, and even fewer will understand it". Nonetheless, Marx acknowledged that Russia was the country where ''Capital'' "was read and valued more than anywhere". The Russian edition was the fastest selling. 3,000 copies were sold in one year while the German edition took five years to sell 1,000, thus the Russian translation sold fifteen times faster than the German original.&lt;ref name="A People's Tragedy 1996 pg. 139"&gt;''A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891-1924'' (London 1996) p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the global economic collapse of 2008–2009, ''Das Kapital'' was reportedly in high demand in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7679758.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Marx popular amid credit crunch|publisher=|date=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Red Quill Books]] released ''Capital: In Manga!'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/capital-manga/| title = Capital: In Manga!| last = Yasko| first = Guy| publisher = [[Red Quill Books]]| year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-926958-19-4| access-date = 25 February 2016| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225150827/http://redquillbooks.com/portfolio-posts/capital-manga/|archive-date = 25 February 2016| dead-url = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a comic book version of Volume I which is an expanded English translation of the wildly successful&lt;ref&gt;Marx's 'Das Kapital' comic finds new fans in Japan.

== Translations ==
The foreign editions of ''Capital. Critique of Political Economy'' (1867) by Karl Marx include a Russian translation by the [[revolution]]ary [[Mikhail Bakunin]] (1814–1876). Eventually Marx's work was translated into all major languages. The English translation by Samuel Moore and Marx's son-in-law [[Edward Aveling]] of book 1, overseen by Engels, was published in 1887 as ''Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production'' by [[William Swan Sonnenschein|Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey, &amp; Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/marx-karl-1818-1883-capital-a-critical-analysis-5809013-details.aspx | title=MARX, Karl (1818-1883). ''Capital: A Critical Analysis of Capitalist Production''. London: Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey, &amp; Co., 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reissued in the 1970s by [[Progress Publishers]] in Moscow while a more recent English translation was made by Ben Fowkes and David Fernbach (the Penguin edition). The definitive critical edition of Marx's works, "MEGA II" (''Marx-Engels Gesamtausgabe''), includes ''Das Kapital'' in German (and French, for the first volume) and shows all the versions and alterations made to the text, plus a very extensive apparatus of footnotes and (cross-)references.

{{Block quote|What is extraordinary about ''Das Kapital'' is that it offers a still-unrivalled picture of the dynamism of capitalism and its transformation of societies on a global scale. It firmly embedded concepts such as commodity and capital in the lexicon. And it highlights some of the vulnerabilities of capitalism, including its unsettling disruption of states and political systems. [...] If ''Das Kapital'' has now emerged as one of the great landmarks of nineteenth-century thought, it is [because it connects] critical analysis of the economy of his time with its historical roots. In doing so, he inaugurated a debate about how best to reform or transform politics and social relations, which has gone on ever since.}}Positive reception also cited the soundness of the methodology used in producing the book, which is called immanent critique. This approach, which starts from simple category and gradually unfolds into complex categories, employed "internal" criticism that finds contradiction within and between categories while discovering aspects of reality that the categories cannot explain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marx's 'Das Kapital' For Beginners|last=Wayne|first=Michael|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|year=2012|isbn=9781934389638|location=Danbury, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Marx had to build his arguments on historical narratives and empirical evidence rather than the arbitrary application of his ideas in his evaluation of capitalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On the other hand, ''Das Kapitalism'' was also criticized for a number of weaknesses. For instance, there are theorists who stressed that this text was unable to reconcile the capitalist exploitation with prices dependent upon subjective wants in exchange relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Rationalist Critique of Deconstruction: Demystifying Poststructuralism and Derrida's Science of the "Non"|last=Brown|first=Morgan|publisher=The Culture &amp; Anarchy Press|year=2017|isbn=9781365481901|location=|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also those who argued that Marx's so-called "increasing misery" doctrine, which is presumed to mean that the proletariat is absolutely immiserated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Blacks and Social Justice|last=Boxill|first=Bernard|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=1992|isbn=978-0847677573|location=Lanham, MD|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sowell|first=Thomas|date=March 1960|title=Marx's "Increasing Misery" Doctrine|url=|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=50|pages=111–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8295">[[Digital image correlation]] analyses have applications in [[material property]] characterization, displacement measurement, and strain mapping. As such, DIC is becoming an increasingly popular tool when evaluating the thermo-mechanical behavior of electronic components and systems.

== CTE measurements and glass transition temperature identification ==
The most common application of DIC in the electronics industry is the measurement of [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (CTE). Because it is a non-contact, full-field surface technique, DIC is ideal for measuring the effective CTE of [[printed circuit board]]s (PCB) and individual surfaces of electronic components.&lt;ref name=JABlog&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akman|first1=Josh|title=The Value of Digital Image Correlation in Electronic Design and Root Cause Analysis|url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/blog/value-of-digital-image-correlation-in-electronic-design-and-root-cause-analysis|publisher=DfR Solutions|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially useful for characterizing the properties of complex [[integrated circuit]]s, as the combined thermal expansion effects of the substrate, molding compound, and die make effective CTE difficult to estimate at the substrate surface with other experimental methods. DIC techniques can be used to calculate average in-plane strain as a function of temperature over an area of interest during a thermal profile. Linear curve-fitting and slope calculation can then be used to estimate an effective CTE for the observed area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flament|first1=C.|last2=Salvia|first2=M.|last3=Berthel|first3=B.|last4=Crosland|first4=G.|title=Digital Image Correlation Applied to Thermal Expansion of Composites|journal=19th International Conference on Composite Materials (ICCM-19)|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the driving factor in [[solder fatigue]] is most often the CTE mismatch between a component and the PCB it is soldered to, accurate CTE measurements are vital for calculating printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) reliability metrics.&lt;ref name=JABlog/&gt;

DIC is also useful for characterizing the thermal properties of [[polymers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diaz|first1=Jairo A.|last2=Moon|first2=Robert J.|last3=Youngblood|first3=Jeffrey P.|title=Contrast Enhanced Microscopy Digital Image Correlation: A General Method to Contact-Free Coefficient of Thermal Expansion Measurement of Polymer Films|journal=ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces|date=2014|volume=6|pages=4856–4863|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/61632/PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymers are often used in electronic assemblies as potting compounds, [[conformal coating]]s, adhesives, molding compounds, [[dielectric]]s, and underfills. Because the stiffness of such materials can vary widely, accurately determining their thermal characteristics with contact techniques that transfer load to the specimen, such as [[dynamic mechanical analysis]] (DMA) and [[thermomechanical analysis]] (TMA), is difficult to do with consistency. Accurate CTE measurements are important for these materials because, depending on the specific use case, expansion and contraction of these materials can drastically affect solder joint reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caswell|first1=Greg|title=Coatings and Pottings: A Critical Update|url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Webinar%20Slides%20for%20YouTube/Coatings%20and%20Pottings%20-%20Critical%20Update.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillman|first1=Craig|last2=Blattau|first2=Nathan|title=Designing and Qualifying Chip-Scale Packages|journal=Chip Scale Review|date=November–December 2012|volume=16|issue=6|pages=32–35|url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/DfR_Solutions_Website/Resources-Archived/Publications/2011-2013/DFR_article_ChpScaleRvwMag_11-12.pdf?t=1506107404374}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a stiff conformal coating or other polymeric encapsulation is allowed to flow under a [[QFN]], its expansion and contraction during thermal cycling can add tensile stress to the solder joints and expedite fatigue failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Serebreni|first1=Maxim|last2=Blattau|first2=Nathan|last3=Sharon|first3=Gilad|last4=Hillman|first4=Craig|title=Effect of Encapsulation Materials on Tensile Stress during Thermo-Mechanical Cycling of Pb-Free Solder Joints|url=http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Effect-of-Encapsulation-Materials-on-Tensile-Stress-Paper.pdf?t=1503583170559|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DIC techniques will also allow the detection of [[glass transition]] temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;). At a glass transition temperature, the strain vs. temperature plot will exhibit a change in slope.

Determining the T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; is very important for polymeric materials that could have glass transition temperatures within the operating temperature range of the electronics assemblies and components on which they are used. For example, some potting materials can see the [[Elastic Modulus]] of the material change by a factor of 100 or more over the glass transition region. Such changes can have drastic effects on an electronic assembly's reliability if they are not planned for in the design process.

== Out-of-plane component warpage ==
When 3D DIC techniques are employed, out-of-plane motion can be tracked in addition to in-plane motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sutton|first1=Michael A.|last2=Orteu|first2=Jean-Jose|last3=Schreier|first3=Hubert W.|title=Image Correlation for Shape, Motion and Deformation Measurements|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media LLC|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-387-78747-3|pages=1307-137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trilion"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Tim|title=Semiconductor (Microelectronics) Applications Overview|url=https://trilion.com/wp-content/uploads/Microelectronics-Overview-January-2014.pdf|website=Trilion Quality Systems|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-plane warpage is especially of interest at the component level of electronics packaging for solder joint reliability quantification. Excessive warpage during [[reflow]] can contribute to defective solder joints by lifting the edges of the component away from the board and creating [[head-in-pillow defect]]s in [[ball grid array]]s (BGA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niu|first1=Yuling|last2=Wang|first2=Huayan|last3=Shao|first3=Shuai|last4=Park|first4=S.B.|title=In-Situ Warpage Characterization of BGA Packages with Solder Balls Attached During Reflow with 3D Digital Image Correlation (DIC)|journal=IEEE Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warpage can also shorten the fatigue life of adequate joints by adding tensile stresses to edge joints during thermal cycling.

== Thermo-mechanical strain mapping ==
When a PCBA is over-constrained, thermo-mechanical stress brought about during thermal expansion can cause board strains that could negatively affect individual component and overall assembly reliability. The full-field monitoring capabilities of an image correlation technique allow for the measurement of strain magnitude and location on the surface of a specimen during a displacement-causing event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bailey|first1=Daniel|title=Full Field Strain|url=http://www.instron.us/~/media/literature-library/whitepapers/2014/12/full-field-strain.pdf?la=en|publisher=Instron}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as PCBA during a thermal profile. These "strain maps" allow for the comparison of strain levels over full areas of interest. Many traditional discrete methods, like [[extensometer]]s and [[strain gauge]]s, only allow for localized measurements of strain, inhibiting their ability to efficiently measure strain across larger areas of interest. DIC techniques have also been used to generate strain maps from purely mechanical events, such as drop impact tests, on electronic assemblies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheijgrond|first1=P.L.W.|last2=Shi|first2=D.X.Q.|last3=van Driel|first3=W.D.|last4=Zhang|first4=G.Q.|last5=Nijmeijer|first5=H.|title=Digital Image Correlation for Analyzing Portable Electronic Products during Drop Impact Tests|journal=IEEE Electronic Packaging Technology, 2005 6th International Conference|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electricity meter''', '''electric meter''', '''electrical meter''', or '''energy meter''' is a device that measures the amount of [[electric energy]] consumed by a [[House|residence]], a [[business]], or an electrically powered device.

[[Electric utility|Electric utilities]] use electric meters installed at customers' premises for [[electricity pricing|billing purposes]]. They are typically calibrated in billing units, the most common one being the [[kilowatt hour]] (''kWh''). They are usually read once each billing period.

When energy savings during certain periods are desired, some meters may measure demand, the maximum use of power in some interval. "Time of day" metering allows electric rates to be changed during a day, to record usage during peak high-cost periods and off-peak, lower-cost, periods. Also, in some areas meters have relays for [[demand response]] load shedding during peak load periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minnkota.com/Pages/loadmana.html E.g., Minnkota Power's Load Management System], accessed 22 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Direct current ===
[[file:DC Electric Meter.JPG|thumb|An Aron type DC electricity meter showing that the calibration was in charge consumed rather than energy]]

As commercial use of electric energy spread in the 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing [[gas meter]]s, was required to properly bill customers, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month.

DC meters measured [[Electric charge|charge]] in ampere-hours. Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, the reading of the meter was proportional to actual energy consumed. For example, if a meter recorded that 100&amp;nbsp;ampere-hours had been consumed on a 200-volt supply, then 20&amp;nbsp;kilowatt-hours of energy had been supplied.

Many experimental types of meter were developed. [[Thomas Edison]] at first worked on a [[direct current]] (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an [[electrochemical]] metering system, which used an [[electrolytic cell]] to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labour-intensive to read and not well received by customers.

[[file:Reason electricity meter.JPG|thumb|left|A 'Reason' meter]]

An early type of electrochemical meter used in the United Kingdom was the 'Reason' meter. This consisted of a vertically mounted glass structure with a mercury reservoir at the top of the meter. As current was drawn from the supply, electrochemical action transferred the mercury to the bottom of the column. Like all other DC meters, it recorded ampere-hours. Once the mercury pool was exhausted, the meter became an open circuit. It was therefore necessary for the consumer to pay for a further supply of electricity, whereupon, the supplier's agent would unlock the meter from its mounting and invert it restoring the mercury to the reservoir and the supply.

In 1885 [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Ferranti]] offered a mercury motor meter with a register similar to gas meters; this had the advantage that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Gooday ''The morals of measurement: accuracy, irony,and trust in late Victorian electrical practice'', Cambridge University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-43098-4}}, p 232–241&lt;/ref&gt; The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a [[direct current|DC]] meter by [[Hermann Aron|Dr Hermann Aron]], who patented it in 1883. [[Baron Hirst|Hugo Hirst]] of the British [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Company]] introduced it commercially into Great Britain from 1888.&lt;ref name="Whyte, 1930" &gt;{{cite book | title=Forty Years of Electrical Progress | last=Whyte |first=Adam Gowans | year=1930 | publisher=Ernest Benn |location=London | ref=Whyte, 1930 | pages=31,'''159''' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aron's meter recorded the total charge used over time, and showed it on a series of clock dials.

=== Alternating current ===

The first specimen of the [[alternating current|AC]] kilowatt-hour meter produced on the basis of Hungarian [[Ottó Bláthy]]'s patent and named after him was presented by the [[Ganz]] Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction kilowatt-hour meter was already marketed by the factory at the end of the same year. These were the first alternating-current watt-hour meters, known by the name of Bláthy-meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugenii Katz |url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/blathy.html |title=Blathy |publisher=People.clarkson.edu |accessdate=2009-08-04| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625015707/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/blathy.html| archivedate = June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AC kilowatt hour meters used at present operate on the same principle as Bláthy's original invention.&lt;ref name=Ricks1896&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ricks |first=G.W.D. |title=Electricity Supply Meters |journal=Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers |date=March 1896 |volume=25 |number=120 |pages=57–77 |doi=10.1049/jiee-1.1896.0005 |url=https://archive.org/stream/journal06sectgoog#page/n77/mode/1up}} Student paper read on January 24, 1896 at the Students' Meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volume 5. 1890"&gt;The Electrical engineer, Volume 5. (February, 1890)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Volume 5. 1890"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Electrician, Volume 50. 1923&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Official gazette of the United States Patent Office: Volume 50. (1890)&lt;/ref&gt; Also around 1889, [[Elihu Thomson]] of the American [[General Electric]] company developed a recording watt meter (watt-hour meter) based on an ironless commutator motor. This meter overcame the disadvantages of the electrochemical type and could operate on either alternating or direct current.&lt;ref&gt;W. Bernard Carlson, ''Innovation as a Social Process: Elihu Thomson and the Rise of General Electric'', Cambridge University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-53312-0}}, pages 1 and 258&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 [[Oliver Shallenberger]] of the [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] applied the induction principle previously used &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 388003&lt;/ref&gt; only in AC ampere-hour meters to produce a watt-hour meter of the modern electromechanical form, using an induction disk whose rotational speed was made proportional to the power in the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Dyer (ed.) ''Survey of instrumentation and measurement''Wiley-IEEE, 2001 {{ISBN|0-471-39484-X}}, page 875&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://watthourmeters.com/westinghouse/shall-watt.html|title=Shallenberger Integrating Wattmeter|website=watthourmeters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bláthy meter was similar to Shallenberger and Thomson meter in that they are two-phase motor meter.&lt;ref name=Ricks1896/&gt; Although the induction meter would only work on alternating current, it eliminated the delicate and troublesome commutator of the Thomson design. Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.

The most common unit of measurement on the electricity meter is the [[kilowatt hour]] [''kWh''], which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one [[kilowatt]] over a period of one [[hour]], or 3,600,000 [[joule]]s. Some electricity companies use the [[SI]] [[megajoule]] instead.

Demand is normally measured in watts, but averaged over a period, most often a quarter- or half-hour.

[[Reactive power]] is measured in "thousands of [[volt-ampere reactive]]-hours", (kvarh). By convention, a "lagging" or [[Inductance|inductive]] load, such as a motor, will have positive reactive power. A "leading", or [[capacitive]] load, will have negative reactive power.&lt;ref&gt;''[[IEEE]] Recommended practice for industrial and commercial power systems analysis Standard 399-1997'', IEEE, {{ISBN|1-55937-968-5}} page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Volt-amperes measures all power passed through a distribution network, including reactive and actual. This is equal to the product of root-mean-square volts and amperes.

Distortion of the electric current by loads is measured in several ways. [[Power factor]] is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. This can lead to a significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.

In addition to metering based on the amount of energy used, other types of metering are available. Meters which measured the amount of charge ([[coulomb]]s) used, known as [[Ampere-hour|ampere-hour meters]], were used in the early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies. The most common application was in relation to special-purpose meters to monitor charge / discharge status of large batteries. Some meters measured only the length of time for which charge flowed, with no measurement of the magnitude of voltage or current being made. These are only suited for constant-load applications and are rarely used today.

== Operation ==
[[file:ElectricityMeterMechanism.jpg|thumb|Mechanism of [[electromechanical]] [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] meter. 1: Voltage coil: many turns of fine wire encased in plastic, connected in parallel with load. 2: Current coil: three turns of thick wire, connected in series with load. 3: Stator: concentrates and confines magnetic field. 4: Aluminum rotor disc. 5: rotor brake magnets. 6: spindle with worm gear. 7: display dials: the 1/10, 10 and 1000 dials rotate [[clockwise]] while the 1, 100 and 10000 dials rotate counter-clockwise]]

Electricity meters operate by continuously measuring the instantaneous [[voltage]] ([[volt]]s) and [[electric current|current]] ([[ampere]]s) to give [[energy]] used (in [[joules]], kilowatt-hours etc.). Meters for smaller services (such as small residential customers) can be connected directly in-line between source and customer. For larger loads, more than about 200 ampere of load, [[current transformer]]s are used, so that the meter can be located other than in line with the service conductors. The meters fall into two basic categories, electromechanical and electronic.

=== Electromechanical ===

The most common type of electricity meter is the [[electromechanical]] watt-hour meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jehl |first=Francis | title=Menlo Park Reminiscences | year=1941 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkL1Smk4uiAC&amp;dq | isbn=978-0-7661-2648-0 | pp = 841 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Magnets and Electric Currents|last=Fleming|first=J.A. | year=1914 | publisher=Spon &amp; Chamberlain |location=New York | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Atw4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA335 | pp = 335 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] AC supply, the electromechanical induction meter operates through [[electromagnetic induction]] by counting the revolutions of a non-magnetic, but electrically conductive, metal disc which is made to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. The current coil similarly consumes a small amount of power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter.

The disc is acted upon by two sets of [[induction coil]]s, which form, in effect, a two phase [[linear induction motor]]. One coil is connected in such a way that it produces a [[magnetic flux]] in proportion to the [[voltage]] and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the [[electric current|current]]. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/fist/fist3_10/vol3-10.pdf | title=Volume 3-10 | format=PDF | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This produces [[eddy current]]s in the disc and the effect is such that a [[force]] is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle ([[power factor]]) between them. A [[permanent magnet]] acts as an [[eddy current brake]], exerting an opposing force proportional to the [[Angular velocity|speed of rotation]] of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the [[odometer]] in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.

Different [[polyphase system|phase configurations]] use additional voltage and current coils.

[[file:ThreePhaseElectricityMeter.jpg|thumb|[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] electromechanical induction meter, metering 100 A 240/415 V supply. Horizontal aluminium rotor disc is visible in centre of meter]]

The disc is supported by a spindle which has a [[gear#Worm|worm gear]] which drives the register. The register is a series of dials which record the amount of energy used. The dials may be of the ''cyclometer'' type, an odometer-like display that is easy to read where for each dial a single [[Numerical digit|digit]] is shown through a window in the face of the meter, or of the pointer type where a pointer indicates each digit. With the dial pointer type, adjacent pointers generally rotate in opposite directions due to the gearing mechanism.

The amount of energy represented by one revolution of the disc is denoted by the symbol Kh which is given in units of watt-hours per revolution. The value 7.2 is commonly seen. Using the value of Kh one can determine their power consumption at any given time by timing the disc with a stopwatch.

&lt;math&gt;P = {{3600 \cdot Kh } \over t}&lt;/math&gt;.

Where:
::{{math|''t''}} = time in seconds taken by the disc to complete one revolution,
::{{math|''P''}} = power in watts.

For example, if {{math|''Kh''}} = 7.2 as above, and one revolution took place in 14.4 seconds, the power is 1800 watts. This method can be used to determine the power consumption of household devices by switching them on one by one.

Most domestic electricity meters must be read manually, whether by a representative of the [[electricity retailing|power company]] or by the customer. Where the customer reads the meter, the reading may be supplied to the power company by [[telephone]], [[Mail|post]] or over the [[internet]]. The electricity company will normally require a visit by a company representative at least annually in order to verify customer-supplied readings and to make a basic safety check of the meter.

In an induction type meter, creep is a phenomenon that can adversely affect accuracy, that occurs when the meter disc rotates continuously with potential applied and the load terminals open circuited. A test for error due to creep is called a creep test.

Two standards govern meter accuracy, [[ANSI C12.20]] for North America and IEC&amp;nbsp;62053.

=== Electronic ===
[[file:Solid-state-electricity-meter.jpg|thumb|[[Solid state (electronics)|Solid state]] electricity meter used in a home in the [[Netherlands]]]]

Electronic meters display the energy used on an [[LCD]] or LED display, and some can also transmit readings to remote places. In addition to measuring energy used, electronic meters can also record other parameters of the load and supply such as instantaneous and maximum rate of usage demands, [[voltage]]s, [[power factor]] and [[reactive power]] used etc. They can also support time-of-day billing, for example, recording the amount of energy used during on-peak and off-peak hours.

As in the block diagram{{where?|date=December 2017}}, the meter has a power supply, a metering engine, a processing and communication engine (i.e. a [[microcontroller]]), and other add-on modules such as RTC, LCD, communication ports/modules and so on.

The metering engine is given the voltage and current inputs and has a voltage reference, samplers and quantisers followed by an ADC section to yield the digitised equivalents of all the inputs. These inputs are then processed using a [[digital signal processor]] to calculate the various metering parameters.

The largest source of long-term errors in the meter is drift in the preamp, followed by the precision of the voltage reference. Both of these vary with temperature as well, and vary wildly because most meters are outdoors. Characterising and compensating for these is a major part of meter design.

The processing and communication section has the responsibility of calculating the various derived quantities from the digital values generated by the metering engine. This also has the responsibility of communication using various protocols and interface with other addon modules connected as slaves to it.

RTC and other add-on modules are attached as slaves to the processing and communication section for various input/output functions. On a modern meter most if not all of this will be implemented inside the microprocessor, such as the real-time clock ([[Real-time clock|RTC]]), LCD controller, temperature sensor, memory and analogue to digital converters.

=== Communication methods ===

Remote meter reading is a practical example of [[telemetry]]. It saves the cost of a human meter reader and the resulting mistakes, but it also allows more measurements, and remote provisioning. Many smart meters now include a switch to interrupt or restore service.

Historically, rotating meters could report their metered information remotely, using a pair of [[electrical contacts]] attached to a ''KYZ'' line.

A KYZ interface is a [[Electrical contacts|Form C]] contact supplied from the meter. In a KYZ interface, the Y and Z wires are switch contacts, shorted to K for a measured amount of energy. When one contact closes the other contact opens to provide count accuracy security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What are KYZ Pulses?|url=http://www.solidstateinstruments.com/newsletters/newsletter%20pages/Mar11/What%20are%20KYZ%20Pulses.htm|publisher=SolidState Instruments |accessdate=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each contact change of state is considered one pulse. The frequency of pulses indicates the power demand. The number of pulses indicates energy metered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www2.eei.org/products_and_services/descriptions_and_access/handbook_meterng.htm | title=Handbook for Electricity Metering | publisher=EEI | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024063933/http://www.eei.org/products_and_services/descriptions_and_access/handbook_meterng.htm | archivedate=2008-10-24 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''KYZ''' [[relay]] creates pulses. The term KYZ refers to the contact designations: K for common, Y for Normally Open, and Z for Normally Closed. When incorporated into an electrical meter, the relay changes state with each rotation (or half rotation) of the meter disc. Each state change is called a "pulse." When connected to external equipment, rate of use (kW) as well as total usage (kWh) can be determined from the rate and quantity of pulses.

KYZ outputs were historically attached to "totaliser relays" feeding a "totaliser" so that many meters could be read all at once in one place.

KYZ outputs are also the classic way of attaching electricity meters to [[programmable logic controller]]s, [[building automation|HVAC]]s or other control systems. Some modern meters also supply a contact closure that warns when the meter detects a demand near a higher [[electricity tariff]],
to improve [[demand side management]].

Some meters have an [[open collector]] or IR LED output that give 32-100 ms pulses for each metered amount of electrical energy, usually 1000-10000 pulses per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]. Output is limited to max 27 V DC and 27 mA DC. These outputs usually follow the DIN 43864 standard.

Often, meters designed for semi-automated reading have a [[serial port]] on that communicates by [[infrared]] LED through the faceplate of the meter. In some multi-unit buildings, a similar protocol is used, but in a wired bus using a [[serial port|serial]] [[current loop]] to connect all the meters to a single plug. The plug is often near a more easily accessible point.

In the European Union, the most common infrared and protocol is "FLAG", a simplified subset of mode C of [[IEC 61107]]. In the United States and Canada, the favoured infrared protocol is [[ANSI C12.18]]. Some industrial meters use a protocol for [[programmable logic controller]]s ([[Modbus]] or [[DNP3]]).

One protocol proposed for this purpose is [[DLMS/COSEM]] which can operate over any medium, including serial ports. The data can be transmitted by [[Zigbee]], [[WiFi]], [[telephone line]]s or [[Power line communication|over the power lines themselves]]. Some meters can be read over the internet. Other more modern protocols are also becoming widely used, like OSGP (Open Smart Grid Protocol).

Electronic meters now use [[short range device|low-power radio]], [[GSM]], [[GPRS]], [[Bluetooth]], [[IrDA]], as well as [[RS-485]] wired link. The meters can now store the entire usage profiles with time stamps and relay them at a click of a button. The demand readings stored with the profiles accurately indicate the load requirements of the customer. This [[load profile]] data is processed at the utilities for billing and planning purposes.

''AMR'' ([[Automatic Meter Reading]]) and ''RMR'' (Remote Meter Reading) describe various systems that allow meters to be checked without the need to send a meter reader out. An electronic meter can transmit its readings by telephone line or radio to a central billing office. Automatic meter reading can be done with [[GSM]] (Global System for Mobile Communications) modems, one is attached to each meter and the other is placed at the central utility office.

== Monitoring and billing methods ==

=== Commercial uses ===

Large commercial and industrial premises may use electronic meters which record power usage in blocks of half an hour or less. This is because most [[electricity grid]]s have demand surges throughout the day, and the power company may wish to give price incentives to large customers to reduce demand at these times. These demand surges often correspond to meal times or, famously, to advertisements interrupting popular [[television programme]]s.

=== Home energy monitoring ===
{{Main|Home energy monitor}}

A potentially powerful means to [[energy conservation|reduce household energy consumption]] is to provide convenient real-time feedback to users so they can change their energy using behaviour. Recently, low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. A study using a consumer-readable meter in 500 Ontario homes by ''[[Hydro One]]'' showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. ''Hydro One'' subsequently offered free power monitors to 30,000 customers based on the success of the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.energetics.com/madri/pdfs/ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf | title = CBPHydroOneReprint | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-08-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231959/http://www.energetics.com/madri/pdfs/ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as [[Google PowerMeter]], take information from a smart meter and make it more readily available to users to help encourage conservation.&lt;ref name=sfgate &gt;{{cite news | author=Verne Kopytoff | author2=Ryan Kim|title=Google plans meter to detail home energy use | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/10/BULM15RHFH.DTL&amp;type=tech | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2009-02-22 | accessdate=2009-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:P3-Kill-a-watt.jpg|thumb|right|One model of plug-in electricity meter, used to measure consumption of an individual appliance; in this case, Christmas lights.]]
Plug-in electricity meters (or plug load meters) measure energy used by individual appliances. There are a variety of models available on the market today but they all work on the same basic principle. The meter is plugged into an outlet, and the appliance to be measured is plugged into the meter. Such meters can help in [[energy conservation]] by identifying major energy users, or devices that consume excessive [[standby power]]. Web resources can also be used, if an estimate of the power consumption is enough for the research purposes. A power meter can often be borrowed from the local power authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austinutilities.com/pages/residential_audit_watts.asp | title=Residential&amp;nbsp;— Home Energy Audit&amp;nbsp;— Watts Up | publisher=Austin Utilities | accessdate=2009-08-04 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312071207/http://www.austinutilities.com/pages/residential_audit_watts.asp | archivedate=2009-03-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a local public library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mge.com/home/saving/energymeter.htm | title=Portable Energy Meter | publisher=Mge.com | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linkcat.info/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=link%3D1100002%40%212072347%40%211100001%40%211100002&amp;menu=search&amp;profile=dial&amp;index=TL&amp;term=Watts%20up%3F%20%5Benergy%20meter%5D#focus | title=LINKcat | publisher=Linkcat.info | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multiple tariff ===
{{original research|section|date=January 2018}}

[[Electricity retailing|Electricity retailers]] may wish to charge customers different tariffs at different times of the day to better reflect the costs of generation and transmission. Since it is typically not cost effective to store significant amounts of electricity during a period of low demand for use during a period of high demand, costs will vary significantly depending on the time of day. Low cost generation capacity (baseload) such as nuclear can take many hours to start, meaning a surplus in times of low demand, whereas high cost but flexible generating capacity (such as gas turbines) must be kept available to respond at a moment's notice (spinning reserve) to peak demand, perhaps being used for a few minutes per day, which is very expensive.

Some multiple tariff meters use different tariffs for different amounts of demand. These are usually industrial meters.

Domestic variable-rate meters generally permit two to three tariffs ("peak", "off-peak" and "shoulder") and in such installations a simple electromechanical time switch may be used. Historically, these have often been used in conjunction with electrical [[storage heater]]s or [[hot water storage]] systems.

Multiple tariffs are made easier by time of use (TOU) meters which incorporate or are connected to a [[time switch]] and which have multiple registers.

Switching between the tariffs may happen via [[Load management#Ripple control|ripple control]], or via a radio-activated switch. In principle, a sealed time switch can also be used, but is considered more vulnerable to tampering to obtain cheaper electricity. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[file:Economy 7 Meter and Teleswitcher.JPG|thumb|[[Economy 7]] Meter and Teleswitcher]]

[[Radio teleswitch|Radio-activated switching]] is common in the UK, with a nightly data signal sent within the longwave carrier of [[BBC Radio 4]], 198&amp;nbsp;kHz. The time of off-peak charging is usually seven hours between midnight and 7:00am GMT/BST, and this is designed to power [[storage heater]]s and [[immersion heater]]s. In the UK, such tariffs are typically branded ''[[Economy 7]]'', ''White Meter'' or ''Dual-Rate''. The popularity of such tariffs has declined in recent years, at least in the domestic market, because of the (perceived or real) deficiencies of storage heaters and the comparatively much lower cost of [[natural gas]] per kWh (typically a factor of 3-5 times lower). Nevertheless, a sizeable number of properties do not have the option of gas, with many in rural areas being outside the gas supply network, and others being expensive upfront to upgrade to a radiator system.

An [[Economy 10]] meter is also available, which gives 10 hours of cheap off-peak electricity spread out over three timeslots throughout a 24-hour period. This allows multiple top-up boosts to storage heaters, or a good spread of times to run a wet electric heating system on a cheaper electricity rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.electricityprices.org.uk/economy-10 | title=Price comparison website | accessdate=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most meters using ''[[Economy 7]]'' switch the entire electricity supply to the cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uswitch.com/gas-electricity/economy-7/#step2 | title=Uswitch comparison website | accessdate=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; not just the storage heater circuit. The downside of this is that the daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal ("single rate") electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent electricity supplier in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://my.edfenergy.com/gas-electricity/tariff-information-labels/view-label?product=ERC1_CORE&amp;postcode=SW1A%202AA&amp;division=01&amp;tariff=STD&amp;paytype=01 | title=EDF Energy Tariff Information Label checker | accessdate=2017-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent [[Economy 7]] costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://my.edfenergy.com/gas-electricity/tariff-information-labels/view-label?product=ERC2_CORE&amp;postcode=SW1A%202AA&amp;division=01&amp;tariff=EC7&amp;paytype=01 | title=EDF Energy Tariff Information Label checker | accessdate=2017-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timer switches installed on [[washing machine]]s, [[tumble dryer]]s, [[dishwasher]]s and [[immersion heater]]s may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period.

=== Smart meters ===
{{Main|Smart meter}}

Smart meters go a step further than simple AMR ([[automatic meter reading]]). They offer additional functionality including a real-time or near real-time reads, [[power outage]] notification, and power quality monitoring. They allow price setting agencies to introduce different prices for consumption based on the time of day and the season.

Another type of smart meter uses [[nonintrusive load monitoring]] to automatically determine the number and type of appliances in a residence, how much energy each uses and when. This meter is used by electric utilities to do surveys of energy use. It eliminates the need to put timers on all of the appliances in a house to determine how much energy each uses.

=== Prepayment meters ===
[[file:PrepaymentMeter.jpg|thumb|Prepayment meter and [[magnetic stripe]] tokens, from a rented accommodation in the UK.

The button labelled '''B''' activates a small amount of emergency credit should the customer run out]]
[[file:London electricity keymeter key.jpg|thumb|A prepayment key]]

The standard business model of electricity retailing involves the electricity company billing the customer for the amount of energy used in the previous month or quarter. In some countries, if the retailer believes that the customer may not pay the bill, a prepayment meter may be installed. This requires the customer to make advance payment before electricity can be used. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} If the available credit is exhausted then the supply of electricity is cut off by a [[relay]].

In the UK, mechanical prepayment meters used to be common in rented accommodation. Disadvantages of these included the need for regular visits to remove [[cash]], and risk of theft of the cash in the meter.

Modern solid-state electricity meters, in conjunction with [[smart card]]s, have removed these disadvantages and such meters are commonly used for customers considered to be a poor [[credit risk]]. In the UK, customers can use organisations such as the [[Post Office Ltd]] or [[PayPoint]] network, where rechargeable tokens (Quantum cards for natural gas, or plastic "keys" for electricity) can be loaded with whatever money the customer has available.

In [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]] and [[Northern Ireland]] prepaid meters are recharged by entering a unique, encoded twenty digit number using a keypad. This makes the tokens, essentially a slip of paper, very cheap to produce.

Around the world, experiments are going on, especially in developing countries, to test pre-payment systems. In some cases, prepayment meters have not been accepted by customers. There are various groups, such as the Standard Transfer Specification ([[Standard Transfer Specification|STS]]) association, which promote common standards for prepayment metering systems across manufacturers. Prepaid meters using the STS standard are used in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sts.org.za|title=Standard Transfer Specification Association NPC / 95/08496/08 &gt; Home|website=www.sts.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/genus-power-infrastructures-ltd/directorsreport/companyid-7916.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saeec.org.za/members/conlog|title=Conlog | publisher = SAEEC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time of day metering ===

Time of Day metering (TOD), also known as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, month and year into tariff slots and with higher rates at peak load periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this can be used to automatically control usage on the part of the customer (resulting in automatic load control), it is often simply the customer's responsibility to control his own usage, or pay accordingly (voluntary load control). This also allows the [[Electric utility|utilities]] to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately. See also [[Energy demand management|Demand-side Management]] (DSM).

TOD metering normally splits rates into an arrangement of multiple segments including on-peak, off-peak, mid-peak or shoulder, and critical peak. A typical arrangement is a peak occurring during the day (non-holiday days only), such as from 1 pm to 9 pm Monday through Friday during the summer and from 6:30 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm during the winter. More complex arrangements include the use of critical peaks which occur during high demand periods. The times of peak demand/cost will vary in different markets around the world.

Large commercial users can purchase power by the hour using either forecast pricing or real time pricing.
Some utilities allow residential customers to pay hourly rates, such as in Illinois, which uses day ahead pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ameren.com/RetailEnergy/realtimeprices.aspx|title=retail-energy|website=www2.ameren.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thewattspot.com/rtsavings.php | title = Real Time Pricing | publisher = Thewattspot.com | accessdate = 2009-08-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090223194312/http://www.thewattspot.com/rtsavings.php | archivedate = 2009-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power export metering ===
{{See also|Net metering}}

Many electricity customers are installing their own electricity generating equipment, whether for reasons of economy, [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] or [[green power|environmental reasons]]. When a customer is generating more electricity than required for his own use, the surplus may be exported back to the [[power grid]]. Customers that generate back into the "grid" usually must have special equipment and safety devices to protect the grid components (as well as the customer's own) in case of faults (electrical short circuits) or maintenance of the grid (say voltage on a downed line coming from an exporting customers facility).

This exported energy may be accounted for in the simplest case by the meter running backwards during periods of [[Net metering|net export]], thus reducing the customer's recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with a ratchet or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid.

Lately, upload sources typically originate from renewable sources (e.g., [[wind turbine]]s, [[photovoltaic]] cells), or [[gas]] or steam [[turbine]]s, which are often found in [[cogeneration]] systems. Another potential upload source that has been proposed is plug-in hybrid car batteries ([[vehicle-to-grid]] power systems). This requires a "[[smart grid]]," which includes meters that measure electricity via communication networks that require remote control and give customers timing and pricing options. Vehicle-to-grid systems could be installed at workplace [[parking lot]]s and garages and at [[park and ride]]s and could help drivers charge their batteries at home at night when [[Energy demand management|off-peak]] power prices are cheaper, and receive bill crediting for selling excess electricity back to the grid during high-demand hours.

The location of an electricity meter varies with each installation. Possible locations include on a [[utility pole]] serving the property, in a street-side cabinet (meter box) or inside the premises adjacent to the [[consumer unit]] / [[distribution board]]. Electricity companies may prefer external locations as the meter can be read without gaining access to the premises but external meters may be more prone to [[vandalism]].

[[Current transformer]]s permit the meter to be located remotely from the current-carrying conductors. This is common in large installations. For example, a [[Electrical substation|substation]] serving a single large customer may have metering equipment installed in a cabinet, without bringing heavy cables into the cabinet.

=== Customer drop and metering equation ===

Since electrical standards vary in different regions, "customer drops" from the grid to the customer also vary depending on the standards and the type of installation. There are several common types of connections between a grid and a customer. Each type has a different ''metering equation.'' [[Blondel's theorem]] states that for any system with N current-carrying conductors, that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy. This indicates that different metering is needed, for example, for a three-phase three-wire system than for a three-phase four-wire (with neutral) system.

In Europe, Asia, Africa and most other locations, [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] is common for residential and small commercial customers. Single phase distribution is less-expensive, because one set of transformers in a substation normally serve a large area with relatively high voltages (usually 230 V) and no local transformers. These have a simple metering equation: [[Watt]]s = [[volts]] x [[Ampere|amps]], with volts measured from the neutral to the phase wire. In the United States, Canada, and parts of Central and South America similar customers are normally served by [[split phase|three-wire single phase]]. Three-wire single-phase requires local transformers, as few as one per ten residences, but provides lower, safer voltages at the socket (usually 120 V), and provides two voltages to customers: neutral to phase (usually 120 V), and phase to phase (usually 240 V). Additionally, three-wire customers normally have neutral wired to the zero side of the generator's windings, which gives earthing that can be easily measured to be safe. These meters have a metering equation of Watts = 0.5 x volts x (amps of phase A − amps of phase B), with volts measured between the phase wires.

Industrial power is normally supplied as three phase power. There are two forms: three wire, or four wire with a system neutral. In "three wire" or "three wire delta," , there is no neutral but an earth ground is the safety ground. The three phases have voltage only relative to each other. This distribution method has one fewer wire, is less expensive, and is common in Asia, Africa, and many parts of Europe. In regions that mix residences and light industry, it is common for this to be the only distribution method. A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a voltage relative to earth.

In the four-wire three-phase system, sometimes called "four-wire wye", the safety ground is connected to a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. In the United States, the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[National Electrical Code]], a large book, revised yearly, widely available for purchase.&lt;/ref&gt; In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.

In North America, it is common for electricity meters to plug into a standardised socket outdoors, on the side of a building. This allows the meter to be replaced without disturbing the wires to the socket, or the occupant of the building. Some sockets may have a bypass while the meter is removed for service. The amount of electricity used without being recorded during this small time is considered insignificant when compared to the inconvenience which might be caused to the customer by cutting off the electricity supply. Most electronic meters in North America use a serial protocol, [[ANSI C12.18]].

In many other countries the supply and load terminals are in the meter housing itself. Cables are connected directly to the meter. In some areas the meter is outside, often on a utility pole. In others, it is inside the building in a niche. If inside, it may share a data connection with other meters. If it exists, the shared connection is often a small plug near the post box. The connection is often [[EIA-485]] or infra-red with a serial protocol such as [[IEC 62056]].

In 2014, networking to meters is rapidly changing. The most common schemes seem to combine an existing national standard for data (e.g. [[ANSI C12.19]] or [[IEC 62056]]) operating via the [[internet protocol]] with a small circuit board for [[powerline communication]], or a digital radio for a [[mobile phone]] network, or an [[ISM band]].

== Accuracy ==

Electricity meters are required to register the energy consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. Any significant error in the registered energy can represent a loss to the electricity supplier, or the consumer being over billed. The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. Statutory provisions may also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed.

For the United Kingdom, any installed electricity meter is required to accurately record the consumed energy, but it is permitted to under-read by 3.5%, or over-read by 2.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Measuring Instruments (Active Elelectrical Energy Meters) regulations 2006, Schedule 1, Paragraph 15. These errors apply between +5°C to +30°C and a power factor of 0.8 leading to 0.5 lagging. Outside of these limits larger errors are permissible.&lt;/ref&gt; Disputed meters are initially verified with a check meter operating alongside the disputed meter. The final resort is for the disputed meter to be fully tested both in the installed location and at a specialist calibration laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electricity-meter-accuracy-and-disputes Electricity meter accuracy disputes]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 93% of disputed meters are found to be operating satisfactorily. A refund of electricity paid for, but not consumed (but not vice versa) will only be made if the laboratory are able to estimate how long the meter has been misregistering. This contrasts with gas meters where if a meter is found to be under reading, it is assumed that it has under read for as long as the consumer has had a gas supply through it.&lt;ref&gt;the Gas (Meters) Regulations 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tampering and security ==

Meters can be manipulated to make them under-register, effectively allowing power use without paying for it. This theft or fraud can be dangerous as well as dishonest.

Power companies often install remote-reporting meters specifically to enable remote detection of tampering, and specifically to discover energy theft. The change to smart power meters is useful to stop energy theft.

When tampering is detected, the normal tactic, legal in most areas of the United States, is to switch the subscriber to a "tampering" tariff charged at the meter's maximum designed current. At US$0.095/kWh, a standard residential 50&amp;nbsp;A meter causes a legally collectible charge of about US$5,000.00 per month. Meter readers are trained to spot signs of tampering, and with crude mechanical meters, the maximum rate may be charged each billing period until the tamper is removed, or the service is disconnected.

A common method of tampering on mechanical disk meters is to attach magnets to the outside of the meter. Strong magnets saturate the magnetic fields in the meter so that the motor portion of a mechanical meter does not operate. Lower power magnets can add to the drag resistance of the internal disk resistance magnets. Magnets can also saturate current transformers or power-supply transformers in electronic meters, though countermeasures are common.

Some combinations of capacitive and inductive load can interact with the coils and mass of a rotor and cause reduced or reverse motion.

All of these effects can be detected by the electric company, and many modern meters can detect or compensate for them.

The owner of the meter normally secures the meter against tampering. Revenue meters' mechanisms and connections are sealed. Meters may also measure VAR-hours (the reflected load), neutral and DC currents (elevated by most electrical tampering), ambient magnetic fields, etc. Even simple mechanical meters can have mechanical flags that are dropped by magnetic tampering or large DC currents.

Newer computerised meters usually have counter-measures against tampering. AMR (Automated Meter Reading) meters often have sensors that can report opening of the meter cover, magnetic anomalies, extra clock setting, glued buttons, inverted installation, reversed or switched phases etc.

Some tampers bypass the meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers of this type normally increase the neutral current at the meter. Most split-phase residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern tamper-resistant meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.&lt;ref&gt;Teridian Semiconductors Application Note, "Antitamper Features Enabled by the 71M6511" The 71M6511 is a single chip metering device widely used in computerised meters.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disconnecting a meter's neutral connector is unsafe because shorts can then pass through people or equipment rather than a metallic ground to the generator or earth.

A [[phantom loop]] connection via an earth ground is often much higher resistance than the metallic neutral connector. Even if an earth ground is safe, metering at the substation can alert the operator to tampering. Substations, inter-ties, and transformers normally have a high-accuracy meter for the area served. Power companies normally investigate discrepancies between the total billed and the total generated, in order to find and fix power distribution problems. These investigations are an effective method to discover tampering.

Power thefts in the United States are often connected with indoor marijuana [[grow operation]]s. Narcotics detectives associate abnormally high power usage with the lighting such operations require.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=James Bong's Ultimate SpyGuide to Marijuana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8N4DwMb19oC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;dq=meter+bypass+marijuana&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iOB2TqbqKpDB8QP_rdXzDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=234–242|chapter=Theft of power}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indoor marijuana growers aware of this are particularly motivated to steal electricity simply to conceal their usage of it.

== Regulation and legislation ==

Following the [[deregulation]] of electricity supply markets in many countries (e.g., UK), the company responsible for an electricity meter may not be obvious. Depending on the arrangements in place, the meter may be the property of the [[meter Operator]], [[electricity distribution|electricity distributor]], the [[electricity retail|retailer]] or for some large users of electricity the meter may belong to the customer.

The company responsible for reading the meter may not always be the company which owns it. Meter reading is now sometimes subcontracted and in some areas the same person may read [[gas meter|gas]], [[water meter|water]] and electricity meters at the same time.

The introduction of [[Automatic meter reading|advanced meters]] in residential areas has produced additional privacy issues that may affect ordinary customers. These meters are often capable of recording energy usage every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. Some meters have one or two IR LEDs on the front: one used for testing and which acts as the equivalent of the timing mark on the older mechanical meters and the other as part of a two-way IR communications port for reading / programming the meter. These IR LEDs are visible with some night vision viewers and certain video cameras that are capable of sensing IR transmissions. These can be used for surveillance, revealing information about peoples' possessions and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=31557 | title = Residential energy monitoring and computerized surveillance via utility power flows | author = Hart, G.W. | journal = Technology and Society Magazine, IEEE | date=June 1989 | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 12–16 | doi = 10.1109/44.31557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, it can show when the customer is away for extended periods. [[Nonintrusive load monitoring]] gives even more detail about what appliances people have and their living and use patterns.

A more detailed and recent analysis of this issue was performed by the [[Illinois Security Lab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seclab.illinois.edu/trustworthy-cyber-infrastructure-for-power-tcip/attested-metering|title=Attested Metering | publisher = Illinois Computer Security Laboratory }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Elucidate|date=May 2015}}

== Oil ==
In 2009 the largest share of oil production was in the Middle East (24 million barrels daily, or 31 per cent of global production. According to [[Transparency International]] based on BP data regionally the largest share of proved oil reserves is in the [[Middle East]] (754 billion barrels, constituting 51 per cent of global reserves including oil sands and 57 per cent excluding them). According to BP of the world oil reserves were in [[Energy in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]] 18%, [[Energy in Iran|Iran]] 9%, [[Energy in Iraq|Iraq]] 8%, [[Energy in Kuwait|Kuwait]] 7% and [[Energy in the United Arab Emirates|UAE]] 7%.&lt;ref name=TI2011&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/content/download/59374/951162/TI_PRT_2011_report_FINAL_EN.pdf 2011 report on oil and gas companies, Promoting revenue Transparency] Transparency International 2011 pages 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, Jim Hollis, CEO of [[NEOS_GeoSolutions|NEOS]], during “Oil and Gas: Governance and Integration” forum, stated that [[Lebanon]]’s potential offshore natural gas reserves are estimated at 25 trillion cubic feet, according to initial estimates carried out in the country’s exclusive economic zone.

'''Flame maple (tiger maple)''', also known as ''flamed maple'', ''curly maple'', ''ripple maple'', ''fiddleback'' or ''tiger stripe'', is a feature of [[maple]] in which the growth of the wood fibers is distorted in an undulating [[Chatoyancy|chatoyant]] pattern, producing wavy lines known as "flames". This effect is often mistakenly said to be part of the grain of the wood; it is more accurately called "[[figure (wood)|figure]]", as the distortion is perpendicular to the grain direction. Prized for its beautiful appearance, it is used frequently in the manufacturing of [[musical instrument]]s, such as violins and bassoons, and fine furniture. Another well-known use of the material is its use in guitars.

During the westward expansion of early settlers and explorers into the lands west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], curly maple was often used for making the stocks used on [[long rifle|Kentucky rifle]]s.

== Workability ==
As previously mentioned, the structure of flame maple consists of distorted patterns found in the wood of specific maple trees. Although this pattern makes its appearance strikingly different from regular maple, the generally behaves in a very similar way. When woodworking, one must consider the type of wood they are working with. Hard woods like oak require heavy-duty equipment to shape, while softwoods such as Pine can be cut and shaved with much less force and lighter tools. Maple woods fall under the hardwood category, though they are generally lighter and easier to work than stronger hardwoods like oak and mahogany. 

As with most other woods, flame maple does have the potential to crack and splinter. To counter this, carpenters working with flame maple must use sharper, quicker tools over their heavier counterparts. Saw blades for example prove more effective against the flame maple when given a fine row of teeth instead of coarser, large teeth one may find on a blade used for oak. Flame maple, (and maple in general) is known for being stiff due to its tight grain pattern and solid structure, so applying too much stress to one side of the maple stock can result in fragmentation, and catastrophic failure. To prevent this, carpenters open use pre-shaped jigs to hold the maple in place.  

== Usage in Guitars ==
'''Popularization'''  

Flame maple is especially popular in guitars, and has been for decades. Generally, the process includes cutting the maple to shape, forming it if necessary through mold-warping and applying a clear coat or lacquer to protect the finish, and ensure the wood holds its shape. Flame maple is especially popular, due to its inclusion on the Gibson Les Paul, particularly the one used by Slash, the iconic lead guitarist of Guns N Roses. As his fame increased so did the fame and value of this guitar style, prompting many guitar companies to provide similar flame-maple finishes thereafter.  

'''Controversy'''  

Among guitar communities, one debate always present is that of tonality. This is the debate on how much or how little the instrument's material affects its sound. While this is a massive debate in itself, flame maple is a hardwood which is generally regarded to produce a bright, shimmering sound, due to its rigidity and reflection against sound waves. This effect is generally noticeable in acoustic flame-maple guitars, but arguably insignificant in electric guitars. Additionally, the effects of clear-coating or applying nitro to a flame maple finish are also up for debate.

[[File:CO2 emission pie chart.svg|thumb|300px|Global carbon dioxide emissions by country.]]

According to the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), the United States produced 6,587 million metric tonnes of carbon-dioxide equivalent [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions in 2015.  Compared to 2014 levels, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions decreased in 2015.  Compared to levels in 1990, emissions have increased by about 4 percent. From year to year, emissions can rise and fall due to changes in the economy, the price of fuel, and other factors.  The EPA has attributed recent decreases to a reduction in emissions from fossil fuel combustion, which was a result of multiple factors including substitution from coal to natural gas consumption in the electric power sector; warmer winter conditions that reduced demand for heating fuel in the residential and commercial sectors; and a slight decrease in electricity demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions|title=Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OA|date=|website=US EPA|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] opted against [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto-type policies]] to reduce emissions, the [[Obama administration]] and various state, local, and regional governments have attempted to adopt some Kyoto Protocol goals on a local basis. For example, the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI) founded in January 2007 is a state-level emissions capping and trading program by nine northeastern U.S. states. In December 2009 President  Obama set a target for reducing U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020.&lt;ref name="eere"&gt;http://apps1.eere.energy.gov/news/news_detail.cfm/news_id=15650 December 02, 2009 President Obama Sets a Target for Cutting U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. State Department]] offered a nation-level perspective in the Fourth US Climate Action Report ([[US Climate Action Report|USCAR]]) to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], including measures to address [[climate change]]. The report showed that the country was on track to achieve President Bush's goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions per unit of [[gross domestic product]]) by 18% from 2002 to 2012.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}} Over that same period, actual GHG emissions were projected to increase by 11%.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}} The report estimated that in 2006, U.S. GHG emissions decreased 1.5% from 2005 to 7,075.6 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]]. This was an increase of 15.1% from the 1990 levels of 6,146.7 million tonnes (or 0.9% annual increase), and an increase of 1.4% from the 2000 levels of 6,978.4 million tonnes. By 2012 GHG emissions were projected to increase to more than 7,709 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]], which would be 26% above 1990 levels.{{citation needed|date = April 2012}}

==General==
According to a 2016 study U.S. methane emissions were underestimated by the EPA since at least a decade, on the order of 30 to 50 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-03-14/us-methane-emissions-are-drastically-underestimated-new-study-shows|title=US methane emissions are drastically underestimated, a new study shows|year=2016|work=PRI}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===2007===
U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from energy use rose by 1.6% in 2007, according to preliminary estimates by the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA). Electricity generation increased by 2.5%, and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector increased even more, at 3%, indicating that U.S. utilities shifted towards energy sources that emitted more carbon. That shift was partially caused by a 40 billion [[kilowatt-hour]] decrease in hydropower production causing a greater reliance on fossil fuels like [[natural gas]] and [[coal]]. Carbon dioxide emissions from [[power plant]]s fueled with natural gas increased by 10.5%, while coal-burning power plants increased their emissions by 1.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/flash/flash.html|title=EIA - Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the U.S. 2006-Carbon Dioxide Emissions|author=|date=|website=doe.gov|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper is the fourth largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and one of the largest consumers of industrial water among all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Eric|last2=Napier|first2=Pamela|year=2012|title=Connecting Values: Teaching Sustainability to Communication Designers|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The State of the Paper Industry Monitoring the Indicators of Environmental Performance|last=Kinsella|first=S.|date=2007|newspaper=|access-date=|work=Environmental Paper Network|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Environment|last=Mortenson|first=L.|date=2001|newspaper=|access-date=|work=OECD Environmental Outlook|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] stated that the "U.S. and global annual temperatures are now approximately 1.0°F warmer than at the start of the 20th century, and the rate of warming has accelerated over the past 30 years, increasing globally since the mid-1970s at a rate approximately three times faster than the century-scale trend. The past nine years have all been among the 25 warmest years on record for the contiguous U.S., a streak which is unprecedented in the historical record."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechangefacts.info/#Fact|title=Facts about Climate Change Science and Ocean Acidification, truth from consensus and climate change skeptics|author=|date=|website=www.climatechangefacts.info|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carbon emissions by categories ==
A study completed in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbontax.org/carbon-tax-effectiveness/|title=Carbon Tax Effectiveness|author=|date=|website=www.carbontax.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a breakdown of how much {{CO2}} emissions are created by certain parts of the United States economy. The largest group being electricity production accounting for 37% of carbon emissions, followed by personal ground travel at 22%, natural gas not used towards power at 11%, movement of goods by boat, truck, or air at 9%, oil refining at 6%, other uses of petroleum at 6%, jet fuel, specifically for air travel, at 4%, and the last 5% spread among other miscellaneous uses. A large portion of carbon emissions created by the United states is from personal use. The University of Michigan created a detailed list of steps that can be taken to lower personal carbon emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/carbon-footprint-factsheet|title=Carbon Footprint Factsheet - Center for Sustainable Systems|author=|date=|website=css.umich.edu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting requirement==
Since January 1, 2010 the USEPA's Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, requires thousands of companies in the US to monitor their greenhouse gas emissions and begin reporting them in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/downloads09/GHG-MRR-Full+Version.pdf|title=Page being updated.|first=US|last=EPA,OEI|date=|website=www.epa.gov|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A detailed [[Greenhouse gas inventory|inventory]] of fossil fuel {{CO2}} emissions is provided by the [[Project Vulcan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.project.asu.edu/index.php|title=The Vulcan Project - Index|first=Kevin|last=Gurney|date=|website=vulcan.project.asu.edu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reduction target ==
{{update|date=December 2015}}
The White House announced on 25 November 2009 that President [[Barack Obama]] is offering a U.S. target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17% below 2005 levels by 2020. The proposed target agrees with the limit set by climate legislation that has passed the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], but the [[U.S. Senate]] is currently{{when|date = April 2013}} considering a bill that cuts GHG emissions to 20% below 2005 levels by 2020. The White House noted that the final U.S. emissions target will ultimately fall in line with the climate legislation, once that legislation passes both houses of Congress and is approved by the President. In light of the president's goal for an 83% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, the pending legislation also includes a reduction in GHG emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2025 and to 42% below 2005 levels by 2030.&lt;ref name="eere"/&gt; The Waste Prevention Rule which was enacted by the Obama Administration in November 2016 to regulate limits on the amount of methane released while drilling for oil and natural gas on federal land was repealed on September 18, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-18/trump-relaxes-obama-curbs-on-flaring-gas-from-wells-on-u-s-land&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/091818-us-interior-finalizes-changes-to-federal-lands-methane-rule&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transportation====
As of 2011, 71% of petroleum consumed in the USA was used for transportation.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/pdf/sec2_3.pdf Primary energy by source and sector, 2011], PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector:
* CAFE:
:The [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) program requires automobile manufacturers to meet average fuel economy standards for the light-duty vehicle fleet sold in the United States. The passenger car standard has been set by statute at 11.7 kilometers per liter (kpl or km/l) (27.5 miles per gallon (mpg)), but can be amended through rulemaking. In 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) raised the standard for minivans, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and other light trucks from 8.8 kpl (20.7 mpg) to 8.9 kpl (21.0 mpg) for 2005, 9.2 kpl (21.6 mpg) for 2006, and 9.4 kpl (22.2 mpg) for 2007. The action more than doubles the increase in the standard that occurred between 1986 and 2001, a period of more than 15 years. It is predicted that this activity might save approximately 412 trillion Btus ({{convert|3.6|e9USgal|m3}}) of gasoline over the life of model year 2005–07 light-truck fleets and is projected to result in emission reductions of 42 Tg of CO 2 Eq. in 2012 for all light trucks after model year 2005.

:In March 2006, NHTSA issued a new rule for light trucks covering model years 2008–11. The new rule raises required light-truck fuel economy to 24 mpg by model year 2011 and will save nearly 1,259 trillion BTUs ({{convert|11|e9USgal|m3}}) of gasoline (73 Tg of CO 2 Eq.) over the life of the affected vehicles. The new rule includes an innovative reform that varies fuel economy standards according to the size of the vehicle. The regulation has also been extended for the first time to large passenger vans and SUVs.

* [[SmartWay]]
* [[Renewable Fuel Standard]]:
: Under the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] is responsible for promulgating regulations to ensure that gasoline sold in the United States contains a specific volume of [[renewable fuel]]. This national Renewable Fuel Standard will increase the volume of renewable fuel that is blended into gasoline, starting with calendar year 2006. The standard is intended to double the amount of renewable fuel usage by 2012. As of 2011, 4% of the energy consumed by transportation was supplied by renewable fuels.&lt;ref name="eia.gov"/&gt;
* [[FreedomCAR]] and [[Fuel Partnership]] and [[Vehicle Technologies Program]]:
: The program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/vehiclesandfuels/ EERE: Vehicle Technologies Program Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; works jointly with DOE's hydrogen, fuel cell, and infrastructure R&amp;D efforts and the efforts to develop improved technology for [[hybrid electric vehicle]], which include the hybrid electric components (such as [[rechargeable battery|batteries]] and [[electric motor]]s).
: The U.S. government uses six "[[criteria pollutant]]s" as indicators of [[air quality]]: [[ozone]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]]s, [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], and [[lead]] and does not include [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es.
* Clean Cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/ EERE: Clean Cities Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427062313/http://www.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/ |date=2007-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement]] (CMAQ) Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/cmaqpgs/|title=CMAQ - Air Quality - Environment - FHWA|author=|date=|website=www.fhwa.dot.gov|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aircraft Fuel Efficiency]]:
: Aviation yields [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions that have the potential to influence global climate. In the United States, aviation makes up about 3% of the national GHG inventory and about 12% of [[transportation emission]]s. Currently, measuring and tracking [[fuel efficiency]] from aircraft operations provide the data for assessing the improvements in aircraft and engine technology, operational procedures, and the airspace transportation system that reduce aviation's contribution to CO 2 emissions. DOT has a goal to improve aviation fuel efficiency per revenue plane-mile by 1% per year through 2009. In the near term, new technologies to improve air traffic management will help reduce fuel burn and, thus, emissions. In the long term, new engines and aircraft will feature more efficient components and aircraft aerodynamics, enhanced engine cycles, and reduced weight, thereby improving fuel efficiency.

* High-[[Global-warming potential|GWP]] Programs :
: The United States is one of the first nations to develop and implement a national strategy to control emissions of high-GWP gases. The strategy is a combination of industry partnerships and regulatory mechanisms to minimize atmospheric releases of [[hydrofluorocarbon]]s (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)—which are potent GHGs that contribute to [[global warming]]—while ensuring a safe, rapid, and cost-effective transition away from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, and other ozone-depleting substances across multiple industry sectors.
**Environmental Stewardship —The objective of this initiative is to limit emissions of HFCs, PFCs, and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in three industrial applications: semiconductor production,49 electric power distribution,50 and magnesium production.
**HFC-23 —To reduce [[HFC-23]] emissions from the manufacture of the [[ozone-depleting substance]] [[HCFC-22]].
**[[Voluntary Aluminum Industry Partnership]] —To reduce [[CF4|CF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[C2F6|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]].
**[[Significant New Alternatives Program]]  (SNAP)-  To phase down the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), such as CFCs and HCFCs. SNAP has initiated programs with different industry sectors to monitor and minimize emissions of global-warming gases, such as HFCs and PFCs used as substitutes for ozone-depleting chemicals.

The implementation of the rule began at the state level in 1998. Recent data on the rule's impact indicate that increasing its stringency has significantly increased the number of landfills that must collect and combust their [[landfill gas]].

: NGA has announced plans to expand statewide regulations on GHG emissions and clean energy initiatives. In a news conference on September 12, Governors [[Tim Pawlenty]] of Minnesota and [[Kathleen Sebelius]] of Kansas unveiled a [[task force]] they will lead along with six other governors to promote renewable energy, conservation, and a reduction in GHG emissions through statewide policies. The [[US Department of Energy]] will provide $610,000 in support for this initiative.

:As chairman of NGA, Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] (R-MN) said that on energy issues, "We have a federal government that doesn't seem to want to move as fast or as bold as many would like." With states creating their own [[US emission standard|emissions standards]], Pawlenty said, there will be a push for the federal government to come up with a nationwide energy policy to address global warming. If enough states act to reduce GHG emissions, it would "become a de facto national policy".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/12/AR2007091201651.html?tid=informbox ,

[[Image:Indig2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Artwork depicting the first contact with Captain James Cook &amp; crew on the shores of the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]], New South Wales]]
The '''Gweagal''' (also spelt '''Gwiyagal''') were a clan of the [[Eora]] tribe of [[Indigenous Australians]],{{sfn|Tindale|1974|p=128}} who are traditional custodians of the southern geographic areas of [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcguinnessonline.com/australia/aussie_people_aboriginals3.htm Aussie People - Aborigines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828125042/http://www.mcguinnessonline.com/australia/aussie_people_aboriginals3.htm |date=2008-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gweagal lived on the southern shores of [[Botany Bay]] ([[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]]). The tribe territory, although not clearly defined, spanned the areas between the [[Cooks River|Cooks]] and [[Georges River]], south to the [[Port Hacking]] estuary and westwards towards [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]]. They were the northernmost tribe of the Dharawal nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssec.org.au/our_environment/our_bioregion/kurnell/history/origins/firstaust.htm Kurnell - A Pictorial History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[Image:Aboriginal hunting implements and weapons.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aboriginal hunting implements and weapons]]
Each Gweagal tribe consisted of approximately 20 to 50 people who lived in their own territory amongst social and economic units having strong ties to land and sacred sites. They had no written language and each tribe had its own dialect, they also knew how to light fires long before the arrival of [[Europeans]]. They were often seen  by early settlers to be naked but with minimal clothing that consisted of a woven hair [[sash]] in which they used to carry tools and weapons and sometimes the optional possum-skin coat for the winter season. They wore resin in their hair that gave it a mop-like appearance and used native animal hide to make fur coats and ceremonial attire. Tool makers chose to grind axes close to pools or streams, as the water was used as a lubricant for grinding and sharpening. The stone that was used was mainly [[igneous]] or metamorphic rock, and only one of the ends was ground to a blade. [[Flint (tool)|Axe]] grinding grooves used in for this purpose can be found near a stream between River Road and Salt Pan Creek at [[Revesby Heights]]. In 1961 a notice was erected describing the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Gweagal Aborigines were the guardians of the sacred white clay pits in their territory. Members of the tribe walked hundreds of miles to collect the clay, it was considered [[sacred]] amongst the indigenous locals and had many uses. They used it to line the base of their canoes so they could light fires, and also as a white body paint, (as witnessed by Captain [[James Cook]]). Colour was added to the clay using berries, which produced a brightly coloured paint that was used in [[ceremonies]]. It was also eaten as a medicine, an [[antacid]]. [[Geebung]]s and other local berries were mixed in the clay and it was eaten as a dietary supplement with zinc.

GEORGE: Rockdale, Kogarah, Hurstville'' Joan Lawrence, Kingsclear Books, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal rock shelters==
Naturally forming and human-modified caves or hanging rock shelters were regularly utilised by the first Australians during walkabout - seaonally guided maintenance of land and the vast natural gardens routinely tended by the Aboriginal people.
In the [[Royal National Park]] some of the caves were used as burial sites. In tribal lands and Dreamtime places this cultural practice continues. Charles Sturt documented large stone dwellings consisting of four rooms or more, along the banks of the Murray river and the shores of lake Victoria. These buildings were re-purposed by invaders, colonists and settlers in the early years of colonisation, the foundations of many such buildings can be seen in archaeological sites around Australia.

A rock cave collapse at Port Hacking prior to the landing of James Cook claimed many lives of the Gweagal.  This cave was later dynamited, showing many skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watt|first1=Bruce|title=The Shire : A journey through time|date=2014|publisher=Everbest|location=China|isbn=9780646920191|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caves and shelters are located in various places along the George's River, which over the years have eroded into the sandstone cliffs. There is a large cave located in [[Peakhurst, New South Wales|Peakhurst]] with its ceiling blackened from smoke. There are caves located around Evatt Park, [[Lugarno, New South Wales|Lugarno]] with oyster shells ground into the cave floor. A cave has also been discovered near a Baptist church in Lugarno, and another near  Margaret Crescent, Lugarno (now destroyed by development), it was found to contain ochre and a spear head on the floor of the cave when it was excavated. Another cave exists on Mickey's Point, [[Padstow, New South Wales|Padstow]], which was named after a local Aborigine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcguinnessonline.com/australia/aussie_people_aboriginals7.htm Aussie People - Aborigines&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829144205/http://www.mcguinnessonline.com/australia/aussie_people_aboriginals7.htm |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia’s First Nation people decorated their caves and homes with carvings, sculpture, beads, paintings, drawings and etchings using white, red and other colored earth, clay or charcoal. Symbols such as “water well” with a red ochre hand directed newcomers to wells and water storage. Footprints on a line signalled that there were stairs or steps in the area.
The dwellings boasted thermal mass unlike modern day housing, which kept an even temperature year-round. Rugs, furs and woven mats provided further warmth and comfort. Fire was used to cook, produce materials and keep their shelters warm.

==Food source==
The territory of the Gweagal had much to offer. The [[Georges River]] provided fish and oysters. Various small creeks, most of which are now covered drains, provided fresh water. Men and women fished in canoes or from the shore using barbed spears and fishing lines with hooks that were crafted from crescent-shaped pieces of shell. [[Waterfowl]] could be caught in the swamplands near [[Towra Point Nature Reserve|Towra Point]] and the variety of soils supported a variety of edible and medicinal plants. Birds and their eggs, [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], [[Wallaby|wallabies]] and [[goanna]]s were also a part of their staple diet. The abundant food source meant that these natives were less [[nomad]]ic than those of [[Outback|Outback Australia]].

==Middens==
Middens have been found all the way along tidal sections of the [[Georges River]] where shells, fish bones, and other waste products have been thrown into heaps. This, as well as environmental modifications such as dams, building foundations, large earthen excavations and wells, gives evidence of where Aborigines established villages for long periods, and are found where oysters, fresh water, and strategic views come together. Middens have been found in [[Oatley, New South Wales|Oatley]], and Oatley Point was known as a feasting ground. In Lugarno a midden is still existent and may be found in Lime Kiln Bay.

==First contact with Europeans==

The Gweagal Aborigines made first contact with [[James Cook]] and other Europeans, occupying the area which is now 'Captain Cooks Landing Place Reserve’, [[Kurnell, New South Wales|Kurnell]], on the shores of [[Botany Bay]].  It was in this place that the crew of Captain Cook’s first voyage tried to make contact with the indigenous people of Australia.

For eight days between late April and early May 1770, Cook’s ship the '[[HM Bark Endeavour|Endeavour]]' was anchored in the bay. Sir [[Joseph Banks]] stated that some of the Aborigines withdrew into the bushes as the Endeavour came near. Several warriors remained on the rocks, "threatening and menacing with their pikes and swords". When Cook and his crewmen tried to land, two of the tribesmen stood on the rocks, warning them off with spears and sticks. After about 15 minutes there was an exchange of musket fire and spears. One shot wounded a local man in the leg, no harm came upon Cook's crew.

The sailors then proceeded to walk onto the beach and up to an encampment. Both Cook and Banks tried, with great difficulty, to make contact with the local people but without success due to the Aborigines avoiding contact after the first encounter, they simply went about their daily affairs seeming to ignore the strangers; they fished from canoes, cooked shellfish on the shore, walked along the beach, but at the same time, watched Cook’s crew with caution. There were a few cases where, Gweagal men tried to approach members of Cook’s expedition, before shying away. In all of their responses, the locals sought to deal with them in a way that would allow them “to affirm their rights to their land and their resources and defuse any potential conflict or hostility."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/publications/pubs/short-history.pdf A place of encounters - A short history of Botany Bay National Park - Kurnell section&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Once were warriors"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/11/10/1036308574533.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Once were warriors | date=11 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/science/hot_science_topics/Botany_of_Botany_Bay/people/indigenous_people Indigenous people - Botanic Gardens Trust - Sydney, Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901080759/http://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/science/hot_science_topics/Botany_of_Botany_Bay/people/indigenous_people |date=2007-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artefacts from Cook's and Banks' encounter ===
In 1770, after returning to England from their voyage in the South Pacific, Cook and Banks brought with them a large collection of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], along with [[cultural artifact]]s from their most recent venture. The find included a collection of roughly fifty [[Australian]] [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] [[spear]]s that were owned by the Gweagal people.

Banks was convinced the spears were abandoned (on the shores of Kurnell) and "thought it no improper measure to take with them all the [[lance]]s which they could find, somewhere between 40 or 50".

Four of those spears - the only material reminders of the first meeting between Aborigines and Englishmen on the east coast still exist: two bone-tipped three-pronged spears, one bone-tipped four-pronged spear and a shaft with a single hardwood head. Cook gave the spears to his patron, [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|John Montagu]], [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] and Fourth Earl of Sandwich, who then gave them, to his ''alma mater'' [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]]. [[Archaeologist]]s quote them as being priceless, as the spears are among the few remaining artefacts that can be traced back to Cook's first voyage.   Although the spears remain in the ownership of Trinity, they are now on display at the Museum of [[Archaeology]] and [[Anthropology]] of [[Cambridge University]] in [[England]].&lt;ref name="Once were warriors"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20080106110430/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2002/725685.htm Radio National Breakfast - 13 November 2002 - Cook's Spears&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Göksu''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for "blue water" also called ''Geuk Su'', ''Goksu Nehri''; medieval Latin: ''Saleph'', [[Ancient Greek]]: Καλύκαδνος ''Calycadnus'') is a river on the [[Taşeli]] plateau ([[Turkey]]). Both its [[Source (river or stream)|sources]] arise in the [[Taurus Mountains]]—the northern in the [[Geyik Mountains]] and the southern in the [[Haydar Mountains]]. Their [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] is south of [[Mut (District), Mersin|Mut]].

==Course==
The river is 260&amp;nbsp;km long and empties into the [[Mediterranean Sea]] 16&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Silifke]] (in [[Mersin]] province). The [[river delta|delta]] of the Göksu, including [[Akgöl Lake]] and [[Paradeniz|Paradeniz Lagoon]], is one of the most important breeding areas in the [[Near East]]; over 300 bird species have been observed. Among others, [[flamingo]]s, [[heron]]s, [[bee-eater]]s, [[kingfisher]]s, [[gull]]s, [[nightingale]]s and [[Old World warbler|warblers]] breed here. The endangered [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle]] (Caretta caretta) lays eggs here.

Due to demand for summer vacation apartments by the locals, and since necessary precautions are not taken and public attention is minimal in this part of Turkey, the ecosystem around Akgöl Lake and Paradeniz Lagoon is in heavy danger.

==History==
[[File:Barbarossa smrt.jpg|thumb|Barbarossa drowns in the Saleph, ''[[Sächsische Weltchronik]]'' ({{circa|1280}})]]
In 1190, while on the [[Third Crusade]], Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] drowned in the river, then known by its Latin name ''Saleph'' and located within the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. The crusaders had reached [[Asia Minor]] in March, where the emperor continued his campaign to the [[Holy Land]]. Having plundered the city of [[Konya]] and defeated the forces of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] at the [[Battle of Iconium (1190)|Battle of Iconium]], his forces arrived on the banks of the river on June 10. 

Several contradictory statements reflect the circumstances of his sudden death, which have not been conclusively established. According to some sources, the emperor was lost in the current when he tried to cross the water near Silifke; other chronicles report he wished to cool down from the heat of the day and suffered a heart attack while taking a bath. The mortal remains were preserved according to the ''[[Mos Teutonicus]]'' process and transferred to [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]], [[Antioch]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] by his followers.

Once without a leader, his crusader's army dispersed; the remnants later joined the [[Siege of Acre (1189–91)|Siege of Acre]]. A monument in Barbarossa's honor was erected on the road from Silifke to Mut.

[[File:Принципиальная схема установки солнечного теплоснабжения RKraft.svg|thumb|200px|A hot water storage tank where one of the heat sources is [[solar heating]]. Almost the same example as above, but in a domestic habitat.]]
A '''hot water storage tank''' (also called a '''hot water tank''', '''thermal storage tank''', '''hot water thermal storage unit''', '''heat storage tank''' and '''hot water cylinder''') is a [[water tank]] used for storing hot water for space heating or domestic use.

Water is a convenient heat storage medium because it has a high [[specific heat capacity]]. This means, compared to other substances, it can store more heat per unit of weight. Water is non-toxic and low cost.

An efficiently insulated tank can retain stored heat for days, reducing fuel costs.&lt;ref name="sysdhw" /&gt; Hot water tanks may have a built-in gas or oil burner system, electric [[immersion heater]]s. Some types use an external heat exchanger such as a [[Central heating|central heating system]], or heated water from another energy source. The most typical, in the domestic context, is a fossil-fuel burner, electric immersion elements, or a [[district heating]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esru.strath.ac.uk/EandE/Web_sites/11-12/District_heating_from_wind/projectoverview.html | title=District Heating from Wind: Kirkwall | publisher=University of Strathclyde Engineering | accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water heaters for washing, bathing, or laundry have thermostat controls to regulate the temperature, in the range of {{convert|40|to|60|C}}, and are connected to the domestic cold water supply.

Where the local water supply has a [[hard water|high content of dissolved minerals]] such as [[limestone]], heating the water causes the minerals to precipitate in the tank (scaling). A tank may develop leaks due to corrosion after only a few years, a problem exacerbated by dissolved [[oxygen]] in the water which accelerates [[corrosion]] of both tank and fittings.

== Insulation ==
Typically hot water storage tanks are wrapped in [[heat insulation]] to reduce energy consumption, speed up the heating process, and maintain the desired operating temperature. Thicker [[thermal insulation]] reduces standby heat loss. Water heaters are available with various insulation ratings but it is possible to add layers of extra insulation  on the outside of a water heater to reduce heat loss. In extreme conditions, the heater itself might be wholly enclosed in a specially constructed insulated space.

The most commonly available type of water heater insulation is [[fiberglass]], fixed in place with tape or straps or the outer jacket of the water heater. Insulation must not block air flow or combustion gas outflow, where a burner is used. 

In extremely humid locations, adding insulation to an already well-insulated tank may cause [[condensation]] leading to [[rust]], [[mold]], or other operational problems so some air flow must be maintained, usually by [[convection]] caused by waste heat, but in particularly humid conditions such ventilation may be fan-assisted.

Most modern water heaters have applied [[polyurethane]] foam (PUF) insulation. {{cn|date=June 2017}} Where access to the inner tank is a priority (in cases of particularly aggressive minerals or oxygen levels in the local water supply) the PUF can be applied in encapsulated form, allowing the removal of insulation layer for regular integrity checks and if required, repairs to the water tank.

== Solar hot water storage tank ==
In a [[solar water heating]] system, a solar hot water storage tank stores heat from [[solar thermal collector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;.Brian Norton (2011) Solar Water Heaters: A Review of Systems Research and Design Innovation, Green. 1, 189–207, ISSN (Online) 1869-8778&lt;/ref&gt; The tank has a built-in [[heat-exchanger]] to heat domestic cold water. In relatively mild climates, such as the Mediterranean, the (heavily insulated but metal-wrapped) storage tanks are often roof-mounted. All such tanks share the same problems as artificially-heated tanks including limestone deposit and corrosion, and suffer similar reductions in overall efficiency unless scrupulously maintained.

== Water tank leakage ==
Water heater tanks may be made of [[vitreous enamel]]-lined [[carbon steel]], [[stainless steel]], or [[copper]].

While copper and stainless steel domestic hot water tanks are more commonplace in Europe, carbon steel tanks are more common in the United States, where typically the periodic check is neglected, the tank develops a leak whereupon the entire appliance is replaced.&lt;ref name="WHRKills"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schuyler|first=Randy|title=The Basics: What kills water heaters|url=http://www.waterheaterrescue.com/pages/WHRpages/English/Longevity/what-kills-water-heaters.html|work=Water Heater Rescue|publisher=waterheaterrescue.com|accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when neglected, carbon steel tanks tend to last for a few years more than their manufacturer's warranty, which is typically 3 to 12 years in the US.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Vitreous-lined tanks are much lower in initial cost, and often include one or more [[sacrificial anode]] rods designed to protect the tank from perforation caused by [[corrosion]]&lt;ref name="WHRAnode"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schuyler|first=Randy|title=The Basics: Anodes and Longevity|url=http://www.waterheaterrescue.com/pages/WHRpages/English/Longevity/water-heater-anodes.html|work=Water Heater Rescue|publisher=waterheaterrescue.com|accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; made necessary since [[Water chlorination|chlorinated]] water is very corrosive to carbon steel. As it is very nearly impossible to apply any protective coating perfectly (without microscopic cracks or pinhole defects in the protective layer)&lt;ref name="WHRChoose"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schuyler|first=Randy|title=The Basics: Choosing a water heater|url=http://www.waterheaterrescue.com/pages/WHRpages/English/Longevity/the-right-hot-water-heater.html|work=Water Heater Rescue|publisher=waterheaterrescue.com|accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; manufacturers may recommend a periodic check of any sacrificial anode, replacing it when necessary.

Some manufacturers offer an extended warranty kit that includes a replacement anode rod. Because conventional hot water storage tanks can be expected to leak every 5 to 15 years, high-quality installations will include, and most US building/plumbing codes now require, a shallow metal or plastic pan to collect the seepage when it occurs.

== Hot water storage tank with closed water circuit ==
This method stores heat in a tank by using external heat-exchangers (coils) that can be directly tapped or used to power other (external) heat-exchangers.

The chief benefit is that by avoiding drawing-off domestic hot water directly, the tank is not continually fed with cold water, which in 'hard' water areas reduces the deposit of limescale to whatever is dissolved in the original charge of water plus relatively trivial amounts added to replace losses due to seepage.

An added benefit is reduced oxygen levels in such a closed system, which allows for some relaxation in the requirements for materials used in the hot water storage tank and the closed water circuits, external heat exchangers, and associated pipework.

While an external heat exchanger system used for domestic hot water will have mineral deposits, [[descaling agent]]s extend the life of such a system.  

== Stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit ==
:''For an illustration - see reference''&lt;ref name="solvarme"/&gt;
Another method to store heat in a hot water storage tank has many names: '''Stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit''', '''stratified thermal storage''', '''[[thermocline]] tank''' and '''water stratified tank storage''' but in all cases the significant difference is that pains are taken to maintain the vertical [[stratification (water)|stratification]] of the water column, in other words to keep the hot water at the top of the tank while the water at the bottom is at a distinctly lower temperature.

This is desirable in places with a wide climatic range where summer cooling is as important as heating in winter, and entails one or more of the following measures:  
* Different heating and cooling loops must send the heated or cooled water in with as low a velocity as possible. (This necessarily entails heating and cooling loops having velocity controlled pumps and tube ports with the maximum feasible diameter.) 
* For cooling applications, cool water is sent out from the bottom and warm (return) water is fed in at the top.
* Heating applications get hot water out at the top and return cool water to the bottom. 
* "Stratification-enhancing" devices within the hot water storage tank (but if the water inlet velocity is as low as possible this might not be needed). 
* A more advanced [[heat control system]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ta.co.at/en/freely-programmable-universal-controller/ Technische Alternative: Freely programmable universal controller UVR1611], Manuals and firmware in english and german: [http://www.ta.co.at/en/downloads downloads], Programing examples: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090213172312/http://solare-ideen.de/Seiten/UVR-Beispielsammlung.html UVR-Beispielsammlung], Practical examples on [[solar heating system]]s with hot water storage tanks with current measuring date: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090303121724/http://solare-ideen.de/Seiten/Livedaten-Solarthermie.html Livedaten]&lt;/ref&gt; is required.

When a stratified hot water storage tank has closed water circuits, the water temperatures can be up to 90 to 95&amp;nbsp;°C at the top and 20 to 40&amp;nbsp;°C at the bottom. Calm, undisturbed water is a relatively poor [[heat conductor]] when compared to [[glass]], [[brick]]s and [[soil]].

(Illustrated by a still lake, where the surface water can be comfortably warm for swimming but deeper layers be so cold as to represent a danger to swimmers, the same effect as gives rise to notices in London's city docks warning 'Danger Cold Deep Water).

Accordingly, an arbitrary volume of hot water can be stored, as long as the stratification is kept intact. In this case there must not be vertical metal plates or tubes as they would conduct heat through the water layers, defeating the purpose of stratification. When effectively employed this technique can maintain water as high as 95&amp;nbsp;°C (i.e. just below boiling) yielding a higher [[energy density]], and this energy can be stored a long time provided the hot water remains undiluted.

Depending on the purpose of the installations, water exchanges tapping different levels allow water temperatures appropriate to the required use to be selected.&lt;ref name="solvarme"&gt;Solar heating system with ''stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit'' and the possibility of reading many current parameters: [http://solar.webseiten.cc/Anlagen/Holzhausen/Live_Holzhausen/live_holzhausen.html solar.webseiten.cc: Live-Daten Holzhausen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[solar heating system]]s the energy parameters can be read as a function of time, from the 'dwell' time necessary to transform daylight into heat, at its peak the maximum hot water temperature near the top of the tank.&lt;ref name="sysdhw"&gt;[http://www.invest-tools.com/pub/solsys/sys_dhw/graph_day.html invest-tools.com: Graphs], Main page and description: [http://www.invest-tools.com/pub/solsys/sys_dhw/ Overview of the DHW system], [http://www.invest-tools.com/pub/solsys/sys_dhw/tank_details.html The water tank (heat reservoir)] Quote: "...With the tank there came a 10 cm "soft foam" isolation that fulfills the minimum insulation requirements...So after several months, I added another round of 16 cm aluminum coated glass wool, and now the tank stores enough heat for about 7 or 8 days when it is full loaded (temperature range is 95°C down to 40°C)..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dual element electric ==
When flow starts from the uppermost outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom. This drop in temperature causes the thermostat to switch on the electric heating element at the bottom of the tank. When the water at the top of the tank is drawn off the hot water at the top is displaced by relatively cooler water, the top thermostat turns the top element on. When the flow stops, the elements stay on until their settings are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/improvement/interior/1275141|title=How It Works: Water Heater|work=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is common to have the top and bottom thermostats set differently in order to save energy, the fact that hot water rises means the thermostat controlling the upper element should feed the hottest supply, while the lower element the warmest.

If the thermostats in such a system are reversed - warm feed from the top, hot from the center - it may not only affect the energy efficiency of the system, feeding scalding water to a domestic hot water outlet may be dangerous, or if directed to warm-feed washers damage them beyond repair.

==Safety issues==
Hot water can cause painful, dangerous [[scalding]] injuries, especially in children and the elderly. Water at the outlet should not exceed 49 degrees Celsius. Some jurisdictions set a limit of 49 degrees on tank setpoint temperature.  On the other hand, water stored below 60 degrees Celsius can permit the growth of bacteria, such as those that cause [[Legionnaire's disease]], which is a particular danger to those with compromised immune systems. One technical solution would be use of mixing valves at outlets used for sinks, baths or showers, that would automatically mix cold water to maintain a maximum below 49 C. A proposal to add this to the [[building code]] of Canada was unsuccessful. &lt;ref&gt; https://canadasafetycouncil.org/home-safety/heated-debate-about-hot-water &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Igniteteamrockets2010.jpg|thumb|160px|A team making last minute adjustments before launch.]]
IGNITE is a program designed to promote the study of engineering and the development of work force skills. It encourages students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mechanics.

SystemsGo is the program and curriculum provided by IGNITE to be used in classrooms across Texas. It is based in [[Fredericksburg, Texas]]. It allows students to learn more about the past, present, and future of rocket technology, as well as using information learned from independent study to complete hands-on projects.

==Annual Rocket Meet==
Every year for 3 days, usually in April, teams from high schools all over the US gather in [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]], Texas to launch their semester project rockets. The IGNITE program offers high school students three different levels of projects, ranging from a mid-sized rocket traveling to a one mile apogee to rockets weighing several hundred pounds with the potential to reach [[Near space|near-space]] altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.igniteeducation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasingly popular meets attract many residents of the area, including children. Events other than watching the main rockets launch include crafts, science projects, food vendors, and visiting with representatives from various universities who set up a booth at the event. All activities are free. There is, however, a small charge for children wishing to purchase miniature rocket kits, which are actually launched in a separate area. The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] also attends the meeting and assembles an outpost to help monitor the weather in order to ensure safe conditions for flight.
&lt;ref&gt;http://fredericskburgtexas.blogspot.com/2010/03/rockets-2010-422-25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Program Levels==

''Tsiolkovsky Level'' : The first stage of the IGNITE Program, named after the Soviet rocket scientist [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], requires students to propel a research package to an altitude of 5,280 feet (one mile) and to recover it after launch. This project is completed over the Spring semester with launches held in Fredericksburg, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systemsgo.org/documents/STEM%20ENDORSEMENT/11th%20GRADE/AEDP%20Tsiol/AEDP%20-%20Synopsis.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

''Oberth Level'' : The intermediate stage, named after the German physicist [[Hermann Oberth]], gives students the goal of designing and launching a rocket able to reach [[transonic]] velocity while maintaining a maximum altitude of less than 13,000 feet. This project is completed over the Spring semester with launches held in Fredericksburg, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.systemsgo.org/documents/STEM%20ENDORSEMENT/11th%20GRADE/AEDP%20Oberth/AEDP%20Synopsis.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

''Goddard Level'' : The most advanced level of the IGNITE Program, named after the American engineer and rocket scientist [[Robert H. Goddard]], challenges students to create a rocket from scratch that can reach an altitude of 100,000 feet, which is considered to fall within the [[near space]] region of Earth’s atmosphere. Rockets for this level are often several hundred pounds and can reach velocities of Mach 3 or even Mach 4.

ECJ is a freeware [[evolutionary computation]] research system written in Java.  It is a framework that supports a variety of evolutionary computation techniques, such as [[genetic algorithms]], [[genetic programming]], [[evolution strategies]], [[coevolution]], particle swarm optimization, and differential evolution.  The framework models iterative evolutionary processes using a series of pipelines arranged to connect one or more subpopulations of individuals with [[Selection (genetic algorithm)|selection]], breeding (such as [[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]], and [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutation]] operators that produce new individuals.  The framework is open source and is distributed under the [[Academic Free License]].  ECJ was created by [http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~sean/ Sean Luke], a computer science professor at George Mason University, and is maintained by Sean Luke and a variety of contributors.

[[File:Mandragoras 454 Dodoens 1583.png|thumb|upright|The so-called "female" and "male" mandrakes, from a 1583 illustration]]
[[File:Mandragora autumnalis1432.JPG|thumb|The [[flowers]] of a mandrake plant]]
A '''mandrake''' is the root of a plant, historically derived either from plants of the [[genus]] ''[[Mandragora (genus)|Mandragora]]'' found in the Mediterranean region, or from other species, such as ''[[Bryonia alba]]'', the English mandrake, which have similar properties. The plants from which the root is obtained are also called "mandrakes". Mediterranean mandrakes are perennial herbaceous plants with ovate leaves arranged in a rosette, a thick upright root, often branched, and bell-shaped flowers followed by yellow or orange [[Berry (botany)|berries]]. They have been placed in different species by different authors. They are highly variable [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[herbaceous plant]]s with long thick roots (often branched) and almost no stem. The leaves are borne in a basal rosette, and are variable in size and shape, with a maximum length of {{convert|45|cm|in|abbr=on|0}}. They are usually either elliptical in shape or wider towards the end (obovate), with varying degrees of hairiness.&lt;ref name=Ungr98/&gt;

Because mandrakes contain [[deliriant]] [[hallucinogen]]ic [[tropane alkaloid]]s and the shape of their roots often resembles human figures, they have been associated with a variety of superstitious practices throughout history. They have long been used in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] rituals, today also in [[contemporary pagan]] traditions such as [[Wicca]] and [[Odinism]].&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/rare_books/herbalism/gerard.cfm | author=[[John Gerard]]|year=1597|title = Herball, Generall Historie of Plants | publisher = Claude Moore Health Sciences Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English name of the plant derived from [[Latin]] ''mandragora'' through [[French language|French]] ''main-de-gloire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=77|year=1855|issue=6|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
All species of ''[[Mandragora (genus)|Mandragora]]'' contain highly biologically active [[alkaloid]]s, [[tropane alkaloid]]s in particular. The alkaloids make the plant, in particular the root and leaves, poisonous, via [[anticholinergic]], [[hallucinogen]]ic, and [[hypnotic]] effects. Anticholinergic properties can lead to [[asphyxia]]tion. Accidental poisoning is not uncommon. Ingesting mandrake root is likely to have other adverse effects such as vomiting and diarrhea. The alkaloid concentration varies between plant samples.  Clinical reports of the effects of consumption of Mediterranean mandrake include severe symptoms similar to those of [[atropine]] poisoning, including blurred vision, dilation of the pupils ([[mydriasis]]), dryness of the mouth, difficulty in urinating, dizziness, headache, vomiting, blushing and a rapid heart rate ([[tachycardia]]). Hyperactivity and hallucinations also occurred in the majority of patients.&lt;ref name=JimeMontLopeCamp90/&gt;&lt;ref name=PiccMondMoro02/&gt;

==Folklore==

The root is [[hallucinogenic]] and [[narcotic]]. In sufficient quantities, it induces a state of [[unconsciousness]] and was used as an [[anaesthetic]] for [[surgery]] in ancient times.&lt;ref name=Grieve/&gt; In the past, juice from the finely grated root was applied externally to relieve [[rheumatism|rheumatic]] pains.&lt;ref name=Grieve/&gt; It was also used internally to treat [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]], [[convulsion]]s, and [[mania]].&lt;ref name=Grieve/&gt; When taken internally in large doses, however, it is said to excite [[delirium]] and madness.&lt;ref name=Grieve&gt;{{cite book|title=A Modern Herbal, first published in 1931, by Mrs. M. Grieve, contains Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-Lore|url=http://botanical.com/botanical/mgmh/m/mandra10.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, mandrake was often made into [[amulet]]s which were believed to bring good fortune, cure sterility, etc. In one superstition, people who pull up this root will be condemned to [[hell]], and the mandrake root would scream as it was pulled from the ground, killing anyone who heard it.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt; Therefore, in the past, people have tied the roots to the bodies of animals and then used these animals to pull the roots from the soil.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;

===In the Bible===
Two references to {{lang|he|דודאים}} ''(dûdâ'îm'')—literally meaning "love plant"—occur in the Jewish scriptures. The [[Septuagint]] translates {{lang|he|דודאים}} as {{lang|grc|μανδραγόρας}} (''mandragóras''), and the [[Vulgate]] follows the Septuagint. A number of later translations into different languages follow Septuagint (and Vulgate) and use mandrake as the plant as the proper meaning in both the [[Book of Genesis]] 30:14–16 and [[Song of Songs]] 7:12-13. Others follow the example of the [[Luther Bible]] and provide a more literal translation.

In Genesis 30:14, [[Reuben (biblical person)|Reuben]], the eldest son of [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]], finds mandrake in a field. [[Rachel]], Jacob's infertile second wife and Leah's sister, is desirous of the {{lang|he|דודאים}} and barters with Leah for them. The trade offered by Rachel is for Leah to spend that night in Jacob's bed in exchange for Leah's {{lang|he|דודאים}}. Leah gives away the plant to her barren sister, but soon after this (Genesis 30:14–22), Leah, who had previously had four sons but had been infertile for a long while, became pregnant once more and in time gave birth to two more sons, [[Issachar]] and [[Zebulun]], and a daughter, [[Dinah]]. Only years after this episode of her asking for the mandrakes did [[Rachel]] manage to become pregnant.

&lt;sup&gt;'''14'''&lt;/sup&gt; And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.

Sir Thomas Browne, in ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'', ch. VII, suggested the ''dudai'im'' of Genesis 30:14 is the opium poppy, because the word ''duda'im'' may be a reference to a woman's breasts.

The final verses of Chapter 7 of [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Songs 7:12–13), are:

According to the legend, when the root is dug up, it screams and kills all who hear it. Literature includes complex directions for harvesting a mandrake root in relative safety.
For example, [[Josephus]] (''circa'' 37–100 AD) of Jerusalem gives the following directions for pulling it up:
{{quote|A furrow must be dug around the root until its lower part is exposed, then a dog is tied to it, after which the person tying the dog must get away. The dog then endeavours to follow him, and so easily pulls up the root, but dies suddenly instead of his master. After this, the root can be handled without fear.&lt;ref name="Hastings2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Hastings|title=A Dictionary of the Bible: Volume III: (Part I: Kir -- Nympha)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RbvnQEACAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=October 2004|publisher=University Press of the Pacific|isbn=978-1-4102-1726-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Mesozoic–Cenozoic Radiation''' is the third major extended increase in [[biodiversity]] in the [[Phanerozoic]], after the [[Cambrian Explosion]] and the [[Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event]]. The Mesozoic–Cenozoic Radiation began in the mid-[[Mesozoic]] and extends through the [[Cenozoic]], with no indication of having yet ended. It differs from the earlier radiations in that the diversity appears largely in the variety of [[species]] and other [[taxa]] below the level of [[order (biology)|order]]. "The spectacular radiation of the [[angiosperm]]s, [[mammal]]s and certain [[reptile]] groups (such as the snakes) on land is matched by that of the planktonic [[foraminifera]], neo[[gastropods]], heteroconch [[bivalve]]s, [[Cheilostomata|cheilostome]] [[bryozoan]]s, [[Decapoda|decapod]] [[crustacean]]s and [[teleost]] fish in shallow seas."&lt;ref&gt;page 5 in {{cite book|author=Owen AW &amp; Crame JA|chapter=Palaeobiogeography and the Ordovician and Mesozoic-Cenozoic biotic radiations|pages=1–11|editor=Crame JA and Owen AW|series=Geological Society Special Publications|number=194|title=Palaeobiogeography and Biodiversity Change: the Ordovician and Mesozoic-Cenozoic Radiations|location=London|publisher=[[Geological Society of London|The Geological Society]]|year=2002|isbn=1-86239-106-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hallam A|authorlink=Anthony Hallam|title=An Outline of Phanerozoic Biogeography|series=Oxford Biogeography|number=10|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=9780198540618}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marine diversification is largely that represented by the modern [[evolutionary fauna]], and there are also the terrestrial diversifications of the [[bird]]s and among the [[insect]]s.

'''Monsoon''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|s|uː|n}}) is traditionally defined as a seasonal reversing [[wind]] accompanied by corresponding changes in [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramage, C., ''Monsoon Meteorology''. International Geophysics Series, Vol. 15, 296 pp., Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; but is now used to describe seasonal changes in [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] circulation and precipitation associated with the asymmetric heating of land and sea.&lt;ref&gt;Trenberth, .K.E., Stepaniak, D.P., Caron, J.M., 2000, The global monsoon as seen through the divergent atmospheric circulation, ''Journal of Climate'', '''13''', 3969–3993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI4089.1 "On Air–Sea Interaction at the Mouth of the Gulf of California", Paquita Zuidema and Chris Fairall, in ''Journal of Climate'', Volume 20, Issue 9, May 2007, published by the American Meteorological Society]&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually, the term monsoon is used to refer to the [[Wet season |rainy phase]] of a seasonally changing pattern, although technically there is also a dry phase.  The term is sometimes incorrectly used for locally heavy but short-term rains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.weathernationtv.com/2016/06/29/welcome-monsoon-season-probably-using-term-wrong/|title=Welcome to Monsoon Season – Why You Probably Are Using This Term Wrong|date=29 June 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630164316/http://news.weathernationtv.com/2016/06/29/welcome-monsoon-season-probably-using-term-wrong/|archivedate=30 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although these rains meet the dictionary definition of monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monsoon|title=Definition of Monsoon|date=28 July 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719113234/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/monsoon|archivedate=19 July 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, studies of plant fossils in China and new long-duration [[sediment]] records from the [[South China Sea]] led to a timing of the monsoon beginning 15–20 million years ago and linked to early Tibetan uplift.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Then, during ice periods, the sea level fell and the [[Geology of Indonesia#Indonesian Seaway|Indonesian Seaway]] closed. When this happened, cold waters in the Pacific were impeded from flowing into the Indian Ocean. It is believed that the resulting increase in sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean increased the intensity of monsoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. S. Srinivasan |author2=D. K.

Five episodes during the [[Quaternary]] at 2.22 [[Megaannum|Ma]] (PL-1), 1.83 Ma (PL-2), 0.68 Ma (PL-3), 0.45 Ma (PL-4) and 0.04 Ma (PL-5) were identified which showed a weakening of [[Leeuwin Current|Leeuwin Current (LC)]].  The weakening of the LC would have an effect on the [[Sea surface temperature|sea surface temperature (SST) field]] in the Indian Ocean, as the Indonesian through flow generally warms the Indian Ocean. Thus these five intervals could probably be those of considerable lowering of SST in the Indian Ocean and would have influenced Indian monsoon intensity.   During the weak LC, there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the Indian winter monsoon and strong summer monsoon, because of change in the Indian Ocean dipole due to reduction in net heat input to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian through flow.  Thus a better understanding of the possible links between [[El Niño]], Western Pacific Warm Pool, [[Indonesian Throughflow]], wind pattern off western Australia, and ice volume expansion and contraction can be obtained by studying the behaviour of the LC during Quaternary at close stratigraphic intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic history of ODP site 763A (Exmouth Plateau), South-east Indian Ocean: 2.2 Ma record of planktic foraminifera|journal=Current Science|volume=90|issue=10|date=2006-05-25|author1=D.

[[File:Monsoons Wet, Dry, Repeat.webm|thumb|This visualization shows the Asian monsoon and how it develops using observational and modeled data. It also shows some of the impacts.]]

The impact of monsoon on the local weather is different from place to place. In some places there is just a likelihood of having a little more or less rain. In other places, quasi semi-deserts are turned into vivid green grasslands where all sorts of plants and crops can flourish.

The Indian Monsoon turns large parts of India from a kind of semi-desert into green lands. See photos only taken 3 months apart in the Western Ghats. In places like this it is crucial for farmers to have the right timing for putting the seeds on the fields, as it is essential to use all the rain that is available for growing crops.

== Process ==
Monsoons are large-scale [[sea breezes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sea+breeze|title=Sea breeze – definition of sea breeze by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which occur when the temperature on land is significantly warmer or cooler than the temperature of the ocean.  These temperature imbalances happen because oceans and land absorb heat in different ways.  Over oceans, the air temperature remains relatively stable for two reasons: water has a relatively high [[heat capacity]] (3.9 to 4.2 J g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-fluids-d_151.html|title=Liquids and Fluids – Specific Heats|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809075541/http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-fluids-d_151.html|archivedate=2007-08-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because both [[conduction (heat)|conduction]] and [[Convective heat transfer|convection]] will equilibrate a hot or cold surface with deeper water (up to 50 metres).  In contrast, dirt, sand, and rocks have lower heat capacities (0.19 to 0.35 J g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d_154.html|title=Solids – Specific Heats|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922143033/http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-solids-d_154.html|archivedate=2012-09-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they can only transmit heat into the earth by conduction and not by convection.  Therefore, bodies of water stay at a more even temperature, while land temperature are more variable.

During warmer months sunlight heats the surfaces of both land and oceans, but land temperatures rise more quickly.  As the land's surface becomes warmer, the air above it expands and an area of [[thermal low|low pressure]] develops.  Meanwhile, the ocean remains at a lower temperature than the land, and the air above it retains a higher pressure.  This difference in pressure causes [[sea breezes]] to blow from the ocean to the land, bringing moist air inland.  This moist air rises to a higher altitude over land and then it flows back toward the ocean (thus completing the cycle).  However, when the air rises, and while it is still over the land, the air [[Joule–Thomson effect|cools]]. This decreases the air's [[relative humidity|ability to hold water]], and this causes [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] over the land.  This is why summer monsoons cause so much rain over land.

In the colder months, the cycle is reversed.  Then the land cools faster than the oceans and the air over the land has higher pressure than air over the ocean.  This causes the air over the land to flow to the ocean.  When humid air rises over the ocean, it cools, and this causes precipitation over the oceans. (The cool air then flows towards the land to complete the cycle.)

Most summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform from year to year. Winter monsoons, by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Monsoon|work= |publisher= Britannica|date= |url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9053445/monsoon|doi= |accessdate= 2007-05-15|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013114728/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9053445/monsoon|archivedate= 2007-10-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''North American monsoon''' ('''NAM''') occurs from late June or early July into September, originating over Mexico and spreading into the southwest United States by mid-July. It affects Mexico along the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] as well as [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[West Texas]] and [[California]]. It pushes as far west as the [[Peninsular Ranges]] and [[Transverse Ranges]] of [[Southern California]], but rarely reaches the coastal strip (a wall of desert thunderstorms only a half-hour's drive away is a common summer sight from the sunny skies along the coast during the monsoon). The North American monsoon is known to many as the ''Summer'', ''Southwest'', ''Mexican'' or ''Arizona'' monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arizona State University]] Department of Geography.

However, it is debatable whether the [[North American Monsoon|North]] and [[South America]]n weather patterns with incomplete wind reversal should be counted as true monsoons.&lt;ref name=Rohli/&gt;

=== Asia ===
The Asian monsoons may be classified into a few sub-systems, such as the Indian Subcontinental Monsoon which affects the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions including Nepal, and the East Asian Monsoon which affects [[People's Republic of China|southern China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]] and parts of [[Japan]].

==== South Asian monsoon ====
{{Main article|Monsoon of South Asia}}

===== Southwest monsoon =====

[[File:India southwest summer monsoon onset map en.svg|thumb|Onset dates and prevailing wind currents of the southwest summer monsoons in India]]

The southwestern summer monsoons occur from July through September. The [[Thar Desert]] and adjoining areas of the northern and central Indian subcontinent heat up considerably during the hot summers. This causes a low pressure area over the northern and central Indian subcontinent. To fill this void, the moisture-laden winds from the [[Indian Ocean]] rush into the subcontinent. These winds, rich in moisture, are drawn towards the [[Himalaya]]s. The Himalayas act like a high wall, blocking the winds from passing into [[Central Asia]], and forcing them to rise. As the clouds rise their [[temperature]] drops and precipitation occurs. Some areas of the subcontinent receive up to {{convert|10000|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain annually.

The southwest monsoon is generally expected to begin around the beginning of June and fade away by the end of September. The moisture-laden winds on reaching the southernmost point of the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian Peninsula]], due to its topography, become divided into two parts: the ''Arabian Sea Branch'' and the ''Bay of Bengal Branch''.

The ''Arabian Sea Branch'' of the Southwest Monsoon first hits the [[Western Ghats]] of the coastal state of [[Kerala|Kerala, India]], thus making this area the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest Monsoon. This branch of the monsoon moves northwards along the [[Western Ghats]] ([[Konkan]] and [[Goa]]) with precipitation on coastal areas, west of the Western Ghats. The eastern areas of the Western Ghats do not receive much rain from this monsoon as the wind does not cross the Western Ghats.

The ''Bay of Bengal Branch'' of Southwest Monsoon flows over the [[Bay of Bengal]] heading towards [[North-East India]] and [[Bengal]], picking up more moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The winds arrive at the [[Himalaya|Eastern Himalayas]] with large amounts of rain. [[Mawsynram]], situated on the southern slopes of the Khasi Hills in [[Meghalaya|Meghalaya, India]], is one of the wettest places on Earth. After the arrival at the Eastern Himalayas, the winds turns towards the [[west]], travelling over the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] at a rate of roughly 1–2 weeks per state,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pz_xAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=After+the+arrival+at+the+Eastern+Himalayas,+the+winds+turns+towards+the+west,+travelling+over+the+Indo-Gangetic+Plain+at+a+rate+of+roughly+1%E2%80%932+weeks+per+state&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F-GltiyNmv&amp;sig=d186S-p8aOL5A4A8uNXo_95IMm4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiFodyBg6TdAhUOIzQIHad6C04Q6AEwAHoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=After%20the%20arrival%20at%20the%20Eastern%20Himalayas,%20the%20winds%20turns%20towards%20the%20west,%20travelling%20over%20the%20Indo-Gangetic%20Plain%20at%20a%20rate%20of%20roughly%201%E2%80%932%20weeks%20per%20state&amp;f=false|title=Weather and Climate: India in Focus|last=Explore|first=Team|date=2005|publisher=EdPower21 Education Solutions|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; pouring rain all along its way. June 1 is regarded as the date of onset of the monsoon in India, as indicated by the arrival of the monsoon in the southernmost state of Kerala.

The monsoon accounts for nearly 80% of the rainfall in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=vdFBDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=The+monsoon+accounts+for+80%25+of+the+rainfall+in+India&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cm8IDCoYCr&amp;sig=QGjB1wICxT72oKd46NMK3GfPLB8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyx_WHtc_YAhUQTI8KHYpvCscQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20monsoon%20accounts%20for%2080%25%20of%20the%20rainfall%20in%20India&amp;f=false|title=Experimental Agrometeorology: A Practical Manual|last=Ahmad|first=Latief|last2=Kanth|first2=Raihana Habib|last3=Parvaze|first3=Sabah|last4=Mahdi|first4=Syed Sheraz|date=2017-12-05|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319691855|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://weather.com/en-IN/india/monsoon/news/2018-06-27-india-southwest-northeast-monsoon|title=Why India's Twin Monsoons Are Critical To Its Well-Being {{!}} The Weather Channel|work=The Weather Channel|access-date=2018-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian agriculture (which accounts for 25% of the GDP and employs 70% of the population) is heavily dependent on the rains, for growing crops especially like [[cotton]], [[rice]], [[oilseeds]] and coarse grains. A delay of a few days in the arrival of the monsoon can badly affect the economy, as evidenced in the numerous droughts in India in the 1990s.

The monsoon is widely welcomed and appreciated by city-dwellers as well, for it provides relief from the climax of summer heat in June.&lt;ref&gt;Official Web Site of District Sirsa, India.  [http://sirsa.gov.in/htfiles/location.html District Sirsa.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228153903/http://sirsa.gov.in/htfiles/location.html |date=2010-12-28 }} Retrieved on 2008-12-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the roads take a battering every year. Often houses and streets are waterlogged and [[slum]]s are flooded despite drainage systems. A lack of city infrastructure coupled with changing climate patterns causes severe economic loss including damage to property and loss of lives, as evidenced in the [[2005 Maharashtra floods|2005 flooding in Mumbai]] that brought the city to a standstill. [[Bangladesh]] and certain regions of India like [[Assam]] and [[West Bengal]], also frequently experience heavy [[flood]]s during this season. Recently, areas in India that used to receive scanty rainfall throughout the year, like the [[Thar Desert]], have surprisingly ended up receiving floods due to the prolonged monsoon season.

The influence of the Southwest Monsoon is felt as far north as in China's [[Xinjiang]]. It is estimated that about 70% of all precipitation in the central part of the [[Tian Shan|Tian Shan Mountains]] falls during the three summer months, when the region is under the monsoon influence; about 70% of that is directly of "cyclonic" (i.e., monsoon-driven) origin (as opposed to "[[convection rain|local convection]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Felix P.|last=Blumer

===== Northeast monsoon =====
[[File:Heavy clouds over Salt Lake, Calcutta.JPG|thumb|Monsoon clouds in [[Kolkata]]]]

Around September, with the sun fast retreating south, the northern land mass of the Indian subcontinent begins to cool off rapidly. With this air pressure begins to build over northern India, the Indian Ocean and its surrounding atmosphere still holds its heat. This causes cold wind to sweep down from the [[Himalayas]] and [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] towards the vast spans of the Indian Ocean south of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] peninsula. This is known as the Northeast Monsoon or Retreating Monsoon.

While travelling towards the Indian Ocean, the dry cold wind picks up some moisture from the [[Bay of Bengal]] and pours it over peninsular India and parts of [[Sri Lanka]]. Cities like [[Chennai]], which get less rain from the Southwest Monsoon, receive rain from this Monsoon. About 50% to 60% of the rain received by the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] is from the Northeast Monsoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdchennai.gov.in/northeast_monsoon.htm|title=NORTHEAST MONSOON|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229133725/http://www.imdchennai.gov.in/northeast_monsoon.htm|archivedate=2015-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Southern [[Asia]], the northeastern monsoons take place from October to December when the surface [[high-pressure system]] is strongest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zhbqbrg2XswC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=characteristics+of+an+oceanic+climate+koppen|title=Climatology|author1=Robert V.

The subtropical flow directs northeasterly winds to blow across southern Asia, creating dry [[air stream]]s which produce clear skies over India. Meanwhile, a low pressure system known as a [[monsoon trough]] develops over [[South-East Asia]] and [[Australasia]] and winds are directed toward [[Australia]].

==== East Asian Monsoon ====
{{main article|East Asian monsoon}}

The East Asian monsoon affects large parts of [[Indo-China]], [[Philippines]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. It is characterised by a warm, rainy summer monsoon and a cold, dry winter monsoon. The rain occurs in a concentrated belt that stretches east-west except in East China where it is tilted east-northeast over Korea and Japan. The seasonal rain is known as ''Meiyu'' in China, ''Jangma'' in Korea, and ''Bai-u'' in Japan, with the latter two resembling frontal rain.

The onset of the summer monsoon is marked by a period of premonsoonal rain over South China and Taiwan in early May. From May through August, the summer monsoon shifts through a series of dry and rainy phases as the rain belt moves northward, beginning over [[Indochina]] and the [[South China Sea]] (May), to the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze River Basin]] and Japan (June) and finally to [[North China]] and Korea (July). When the monsoon ends in August, the rain belt moves back to [[Northern and southern China|South China]].

=== Australia ===
[[File:Evening monsoonal squall.jpg|thumb|Monsoonal squall nears [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], [[Australia]]]]

Also known as the '''Indo-Australian Monsoon'''. The rainy season occurs from September to February and it is a major source of energy for the Hadley circulation during boreal winter. The ''Maritime Continent Monsoon'' and the ''Australian Monsoon'' may be considered to be the same system, the Indo-Australian Monsoon.

It is associated with the development of the [[Siberian High]] and the movement of the heating maxima from the [[Northern Hemisphere]] to the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. North-easterly winds flow down [[Southeast Asia]], are turned north-westerly/westerly by [[Borneo]] topography towards [[Australia]]. This forms a cyclonic circulation vortex over Borneo, which together with descending cold surges of winter air from higher latitudes, cause significant weather phenomena in the region. Examples are the formation of a rare low-latitude tropical storm in 2001, [[Tropical Storm Vamei]], and the [[2007 Jakarta flood|devastating flood of Jakarta]] in 2007.

The onset of the monsoon over the Maritime Continent tends to follow the heating maxima down [[Vietnam]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]] (September), to [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]] and the [[Philippines]] (October), to [[Java]], [[Sulawesi]] (November), [[Irian Jaya]] and [[Northern Australia]] (December, January). However, the monsoon is not a simple response to heating but a more complex interaction of topography, wind and sea, as demonstrated by its abrupt rather than gradual withdrawal from the region. The Australian monsoon (the "Wet") occurs in the southern summer when the monsoon trough develops over Northern Australia. Over three-quarters of annual rainfall in Northern Australia falls during this time.

=== Europe ===
{{See also|Climate of Europe}}
The '''European Monsoon''' (more commonly known as the '''return of the westerlies''') is the result of a resurgence of westerly winds from the [[Atlantic]], where they become loaded with wind and rain.&lt;ref&gt;Visser, S.W. (1953). Some remarks on the European monsoon. Birkhäuser: Basel.&lt;/ref&gt; These westerly winds are a common phenomenon during the European winter, but they ease as spring approaches in late March and through April and May. The winds pick up again in June, which is why this phenomenon is also referred to as "the return of the westerlies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leo Hickman|publisher=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/09/weather.europe|title=The Question: What is the European monsoon?|accessdate=2009-06-09|date=2008-07-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902125943/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/09/weather.europe|archivedate=2013-09-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rain usually arrives in two waves, at the beginning of June and again in mid- to late June. The European monsoon is not a monsoon in the traditional sense in that it doesn't meet all the requirements to be classified as such. Instead the return of the westerlies is more regarded as a conveyor belt that delivers a series of low pressure centres to [[Western Europe]] where they create unsettled weather. These storms generally feature significantly lower than average temperatures, fierce rain or hail, thunder and strong winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Simons|publisher=The Times|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article6451573.ece|title='European Monsoon' to blame for cold and rainy start to June|accessdate=2009-06-09|date=2009-06-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604174824/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article6451573.ece|archivedate=2011-06-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The return of the westerlies affects Europe's [[Northern Europe|Northern Atlantic]] coastline, more precisely [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], the [[Benelux|Benelux countries]], [[Western Germany]], [[Northern France]] and parts of [[Scandinavia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25230">'''Optical heterodyne detection''' is a method of extracting information encoded as [[modulation]] of the [[Phase modulation|phase]], [[frequency modulation|frequency]] or both of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[wavelength]] band of visible or [[infrared]] light. The light signal is compared with standard or reference light from a "local oscillator" (LO) that would have a fixed offset in frequency and phase from the signal if the latter carried null information. "Heterodyne" signifies more than one frequency, in contrast to the single frequency employed in [[homodyne detection]].&lt;ref name=Renishaw&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Renishaw plc (UK) |url=http://resources.renishaw.com/en/download/white-paper-homodyne-and-heterodyne-interferometry--5653 |title=Optical detection techniques: homodyne versus heterodyne |date=2002 |accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The comparison of the two light signals is typically accomplished by combining them in a [[photodiode]] detector, which has a response that is [[Linearity#Physics|linear]] in [[energy]], and hence [[quadratic function|quadratic]] in [[amplitude]] of [[electromagnetic field]]. Typically, the two light frequencies are similar enough that their difference or [[Beat (acoustics)|beat frequency]] produced by the detector is in the radio or microwave band that can be conveniently processed by electronic means.

This technique became widely applicable to [[topography|topographical]] and [[velocity]]-sensitive [[LIDAR|imaging]] with the invention in the 1990s of synthetic array heterodyne detection.&lt;ref name="SAHD" /&gt; The light reflected from a target scene is focussed on a relatively inexpensive photodetector consisting of a single large physical pixel, while a different LO frequency is also tightly focussed on each virtual pixel of this detector, resulting in an electrical signal from the detector carrying a mixture of beat frequencies that can be electronically isolated and distributed spatially to present an image of the scene.&lt;ref name="SAHD"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1364/OL.19.001609 |pmid=19855597 |title=Synthetic-array heterodyne detection: a single-element detector acts as an array |year=1994 |last1=Strauss|first1=Charlie E. M. |journal=Optics Letters |volume=19 |issue=20 |pages=1609–11 |bibcode = 1994OptL...19.1609S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Optical heterodyne detection began to be studied at least as early as 1962, within two years of the construction of the first [[laser]].&lt;ref name="MIL-TRG"&gt;{{cite report |title=Technical Note on Heterodyne Detection in Optical Communications |last=Jacobs|first=Stephen |publisher=Technical Research Group, Inc. |number=RADC-TDR-62-491 |ref=TRG-168-TDR-1 |location=Syosset, New York |date=30 November 1962 |accessdate=15 February 2017 |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/296362.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrast to conventional radio frequency (RF) heterodyne detection==
It is instructive to contrast the practical aspects of [[optical band]] detection to [[radio frequency|Radio Frequency]] (RF) band [[heterodyne]] detection.

===Energy versus electric field detection===
Unlike RF band detection, optical frequencies oscillate too rapidly to directly measure and process the electric field electronically. Instead optical photons are (usually) detected by absorbing the photon's energy, thus only revealing the magnitude, and not by following the electric field phase.  Hence the primary purpose of [[heterodyne]] mixing is to down shift the signal from the optical band to an electronically tractable frequency range.

In RF band detection, typically, the electromagnetic field drives oscillatory motion of electrons in an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]; the captured [[Electromagnetic field|EMF]] is subsequently electronically mixed with a local oscillator (LO) by any convenient non-linear circuit element with a quadratic term (most commonly a rectifier). In optical detection, the desired non-linearity is inherent in the photon absorption process itself.  Conventional light detectors—so called "Square-law detectors"—respond to the photon energy to free bound electrons, and since the energy flux scales as the square of the electric field, so does the rate at which electrons are freed.  A difference frequency only appears in the detector output current when both the LO and signal illuminate the detector at the same time, causing the square of their combined fields to have a cross term  or "difference" frequency modulating the average rate at which free electrons are generated.

===Wideband local oscillators for coherent detection===
Another point of contrast is the expected bandwidth of the signal and local oscillator. Typically, an RF local oscillator is a pure frequency; pragmatically, "purity" means that a local oscillator's frequency bandwidth is much much less than the difference frequency. With optical signals, even with a laser, it is not simple to produce a reference frequency sufficiently pure to have either an instantaneous bandwidth or long term temporal stability that is less than a typical megahertz or kilohertz scale difference frequency. For this reason, the same source is often used to produce the LO and the signal so that their difference frequency can be kept constant even if the center frequency wanders.

As a result, the mathematics of squaring the sum of two pure tones, normally invoked to explain RF [[heterodyne detection]], is an oversimplified model of optical heterodyne detection. Nevertheless, the intuitive pure-frequency heterodyne concept still holds perfectly for the [[wideband]] case ''provided that the signal and LO  are mutually coherent''. Indeed, one can obtain narrow-band interference from coherent broadband sources: this is the basis for [[White light scanner|white light interferometry]] and [[optical coherence tomography]]. Mutual coherence permits the rainbow in [[Newton's rings]], and [[Rainbow#Supernumerary rainbows|supernumerary rainbows]].

Consequently, optical heterodyne detection is usually performed as [[interferometry]] where the LO and signal share a common origin, rather than, as in radio, a transmitter sending to a remote receiver. The remote receiver geometry is uncommon because generating a local oscillator signal that is coherent with a signal of independent origin is technologically difficult at optical frequencies. However, lasers of sufficiently narrow linewidth to allow the signal and LO to originate from different lasers do exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.23.277|title=Direct Observation of the Lorentzian Line Shape as Limited by Quantum Phase Noise in a Laser above Threshold|year=1969|last1=Hinkley|first1=E.|last2=Freed|first2=Charles|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=23|pages=277|bibcode=1969PhRvL..23..277H|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon Counting===
After optical heterodyne became an established technique, consideration was given to the conceptual basis for operation at such low signal light levels that "only a few, or even fractions of, photons enter the receiver in a characteristic time interval".&lt;ref name="WinzerLeeb1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winzer|first1=Peter J.|last2=Leeb|first2=Walter R.|title=Coherent lidar at low signal powers: Basic considerations on optical heterodyning|journal=Journal of Modern Optics|volume=45|issue=8|year=1998|pages=1549–1555|issn=0950-0340|doi=10.1080/09500349808230651|bibcode=1998JMOp...45.1549W}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was concluded that even when photons of different energies are absorbed at a countable rate by a detector at different (random) times, the detector can still produce a difference frequency. Hence light seems to have wave-like properties not only as it propagates through space, but also when it interacts with matter.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feynman |first1=Richard P. |last2=Leighton |first2=Robert B. |last3=Sands |first3=Matthew |title=[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]: The Definitive and Extended Edition |origyear=1970 |year=2005 |volume=2 |page=111 |publisher=Addison Wesley |edition=2nd |isbn=0-8053-9045-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Progress with photon counting was such that by 2008 it was proposed that, even with larger signal strengths available, it could be advantageous to employ local oscillator power low enough to allow detection of the beat signal by photon counting. This was understood to have a main advantage of imaging with available and rapidly developing large-format multi-pixel counting photodetectors.&lt;ref name="JiangLuu2008"/&gt;

Photon counting was applied with [[Frequency modulation|frequency-modulated]] [[continuous wave]] (FMCW) lasers. [[Numerical analysis|Numerical algorithm]]s were developed to optimize the statistical performance of the analysis of the data from photon counting.&lt;ref name="ErkmenBarber2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erkmen|first1=Baris I. |last2=Barber|first2=Zeb W. |last3=Dahl|first3=Jason| title=Maximum-likelihood estimation for frequency-modulated continuous-wave laser ranging using photon-counting detectors|journal=Applied Optics|volume=52|issue=10|year=2013|pages=2008|issn=0003-6935|doi=10.1364/AO.52.002008|bibcode=2013ApOpt..52.2008E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ErkmenDahl2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erkmen|first1=Baris |last2=Dahl|first2=Jason R. |last3=Barber|first3=Zeb W. |title=Performance Analysis for FMCW Ranging Using Photon-Counting Detectors|year=2013 |pages=CTu1H.7 |doi=10.1364/CLEO_SI.2013.CTu1H.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LiuZhang2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Lisheng |last2=Zhang|first2=Heyong |last3=Guo|first3=Jin |last4=Zhao|first4=Shuai |last5=Wang|first5=Tingfeng |title=Photon time-interval statistics applied to the analysis of laser heterodyne signal with photon counter |journal=Optics Communications|volume=285| issue=18|year=2012| pages=3820–3826| issn=0030-4018| doi=10.1016/j.optcom.2012.05.019|bibcode=2012OptCo.285.3820L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key benefits==

===Gain in the detection===
The amplitude of the down-mixed difference frequency can be larger than the amplitude of the original signal itself. The difference frequency signal is proportional to the product of the ''amplitudes'' of the LO and signal electric fields. Thus the larger the LO amplitude, the larger the difference-frequency amplitude.  Hence there is gain in the photon conversion process itself.
:&lt;math&gt;I\propto \left[ E_\mathrm{sig}\cos(\omega_\mathrm{sig}t+\varphi) + E_\mathrm{LO}\cos(\omega_\mathrm{LO}t) \right]^2 \propto \frac{1}{2}E_\mathrm{sig}^2+\frac{1}{2}E_\mathrm{LO}^2+2E_\mathrm{LO}E_\mathrm{sig}\cos(\omega_\mathrm{sig}t+\varphi)\cos(\omega_\mathrm{LO}t) &lt;/math&gt;
The first two terms are proportional to the average (DC) energy flux absorbed (or, equivalently, the average current in the case of photon counting). The third term is time varying and creates the sum and difference frequencies.  In the optical regime the sum frequency will be too high to pass through the subsequent electronics.  In many applications the signal is weaker than the LO, thus it can be seen that gain occurs because the energy flux  in the difference frequency &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{LO}E_\mathrm{sig}&lt;/math&gt;  is greater than the DC energy flux of the signal by itself &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{sig}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Preservation of optical phase===
By itself, the signal beam's energy flux, &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{sig}^2&lt;/math&gt;, is DC and thus erases the phase associated with its optical frequency; [[Heterodyne detection]] allows this phase to be detected.  If the optical phase of the signal beam shifts by an angle phi, then the phase of the electronic difference frequency shifts by exactly the same angle phi.  More properly, to discuss an optical phase shift one needs to have a common time base reference.  Typically the signal beam is derived from the same laser as the LO but shifted by some modulator in frequency. In other cases, the frequency shift may arise from reflection from a moving object.  As long as the modulation source maintains a constant offset phase between the LO and signal source, any added optical phase shifts over time arising from external modification of the return signal are added to the phase of the difference frequency and thus are measurable.

===Mapping optical frequencies to electronic frequencies allows sensitive measurements===
As noted above,  the difference frequency linewidth can be much smaller than the optical linewidth of the signal and LO signal, provided the two are mutually coherent. Thus small shifts in optical signal center-frequency can be measured: For example, Doppler [[lidar]] systems can discriminate wind velocities with a resolution better than 1 meter per second, which is less than a part in a billion Doppler shift in the optical frequency. Likewise small coherent phase shifts can be measured even for nominally incoherent broadband light, allowing [[optical coherence tomography]] to image micrometer-sized features.  Because of this, an electronic filter can define an effective optical frequency bandpass that is narrower than any realizable wavelength filter operating on the light itself, and thereby enable background light rejection and hence the detection of weak signals.

===Noise reduction to shot noise limit===
As with any small signal amplification, it is most desirable to get gain as close as possible to the initial point of the signal interception: moving the gain ahead of any signal processing reduces the additive contributions of effects like resistor [[Johnson-Nyquist noise]], or electrical noises in active circuits.  In optical heterodyne detection, the mixing-gain happens directly in the physics of the initial photon absorption event, making this ideal.  Additionally, to a first approximation, absorption is perfectly quadratic, in contrast to RF detection by a diode non-linearity.

One of the virtues of heterodyne detection is that the difference frequency is generally far removed [[Frequency spectrum|spectrally]] from the potential noises radiated during the process of generating either the signal or the LO signal, thus  the spectral region near the difference frequency may be relatively quiet. Hence, narrow electronic filtering near the difference frequency is highly effective at removing the remaining, generally broadband, noise sources.

The primary remaining source of noise is photon shot noise from the nominally constant DC level, which is typically dominated by the Local Oscillator (LO). Since the [[Shot noise]] scales as the ''amplitude'' of the LO electric field level, and the heterodyne gain also scales the same way, the ratio of the shot noise to the mixed signal is constant no matter how large the LO.

Thus in practice one increases the LO level, until the gain on the signal raises it above all other additive noise sources, leaving only the shot noise. In this limit, the signal to noise ratio is affected by the shot noise of the ''signal'' only (i.e. there is no noise contribution from the powerful LO because it divided out of the ratio).  At that point there is no change in the signal to noise as the gain is raised further. (Of course, this is a highly idealized description; practical limits on the LO intensity matter in real detectors and an impure LO might carry some noise at the difference frequency)

==Key problems and their solutions==
===Array detection and imaging===
Array detection of light, i.e. detecting light in a large number of independent detector pixels, is common in digital camera [[image sensor]]s. However, it tends to be quite difficult in heterodyne detection, since the signal of interest is oscillating (also called [[Alternating current|AC]] by analogy to circuits), often at millions of cycles per second or more. At the typical frame rates for image sensors, which are much slower, each pixel would integrate the total light received over many oscillation cycles, and this time-integration would destroy the signal of interest. Thus a heterodyne array must usually have parallel direct connections from every sensor pixel to separate electrical amplifiers, filters, and processing systems. This makes large, general purpose, heterodyne imaging systems prohibitively expensive. For example, simply attaching 1 million leads to a megapixel coherent array is a daunting challenge.

To solve this problem, synthetic array heterodyne detection (SAHD) was developed.&lt;ref name="SAHD" /&gt; In SAHD, large imaging arrays can be [[Multiplexing|multiplex]]ed into virtual pixels on a single element detector with single readout lead, single electrical filter, and single recording system. The time domain conjugate of this approach is [[Fourier transform heterodyne detection]],&lt;ref name="Cooke1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cooke|first1=Bradly J. |last2=Galbraith|first2=Amy E. |last3=Laubscher|first3=Bryan E. |last4=Strauss|first4=Charlie E. M. |last5=Olivas|first5=Nicholas L. |last6=Grubler|first6=Andrew C. |title=Laser field imaging through Fourier transform heterodyne |volume=3707 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=390–408 |issn=0277-786X |doi=10.1117/12.351361 |url=http://www.citeulike.org/user/tino/article/1584658}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also has the multiplex advantage and also allows a single element detector to act like an imaging array. SAHD has been implemented as [[Rainbow heterodyne detection]]&lt;ref&gt;Strauss, C.E.M. and Rehse, S.J. "[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=864560&amp;isnumber=18726 Rainbow heterodyne detection]"
Lasers and Electro-Optics, 1996. CLEO Pub Date: 2–7 June 1996 (200) {{isbn|1-55752-443-2}} [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/94587-HpUg8K/webviewable/94587.PDF (See DOE archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Multi-Pixel Synthetic Array Heterodyne Detection Report", 1995, Strauss, C.E.M. and Rehse, S.J. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265384183_multi-pixel_synthetic_array_rainbow_heterodyne_detection_1995]&lt;/ref&gt; in which instead of a single frequency LO, many narrowly spaced frequencies are spread out across the detector element surface like a rainbow. The physical position where each photon arrived is encoded in the resulting difference frequency itself, making a virtual 1D array on a single element detector. If the frequency comb is evenly spaced then, conveniently, the [[Fourier transform]] of the output waveform is the image itself.  Arrays in 2D can be created as well, and since the arrays are virtual, the number of pixels, their size, and their individual gains can be adapted dynamically.  The multiplex disadvantage is that the shot noise from all the pixels combine since they are not physically separated.

===Speckle and diversity reception===
As discussed, the LO and signal must be temporally [[Coherent light|coherent]]. They also need to be spatially coherent across the face of the detector or they will destructively interfere. In many usage scenarios the signal is reflected from optically rough surfaces or passes through optically turbulent media leading to [[wavefront]]s that are spatially incoherent. In laser scattering this is known as [[speckle pattern|speckle]].&lt;ref name="name=Dainty"&gt;Dainty C (Ed), Laser Speckle and Related Phenomena, 1984, Springer Verlag, {{isbn|0-387-13169-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RF detection the antenna is rarely larger than the wavelength so all excited electrons move coherently within the antenna, whereas in optics the detector is usually much larger than the wavelength and thus can intercept a distorted phase front, resulting in destructive interference by out-of-phase photo-generated electrons within the detector.

While destructive interference dramatically reduces the signal level, the summed amplitude of a spatially incoherent mixture does not approach zero but rather the mean amplitude of a single speckle.&lt;ref name="name=Dainty"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the standard deviation of the coherent sum of the speckles is exactly equal to the mean speckle intensity, optical heterodyne detection of scrambled phase fronts can never measure the absolute light level with an error bar less than the size of the signal itself. ''This upper bound signal-to-noise ratio of unity is only for absolute magnitude measurement'': it can have [[signal-to-noise ratio]] better than unity for phase, frequency or time-varying relative-amplitude measurements in a stationary speckle field.

In RF detection, "diversity reception" is often used when the primary antenna is coincidentally located at an interference null point: by having more than one antenna one can adaptively switch to whichever antenna has the strongest signal or even incoherently add all of the antenna signals. Simply adding the antennae coherently can produce destructive interference just as happens in the optical realm.

The analogous diversity reception for optical heterodyne has been demonstrated with arrays of photon-counting detectors.&lt;ref name="JiangLuu2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1364/AO.47.001486|pmid=18382577 |issn=0003-6935 |title=Heterodyne detection with a weak local oscillator |year=2008|last1=Jiang|first1=Leaf A.|last2=Luu|first2=Jane X.|journal=Applied Optics|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1486–503|bibcode = 2008ApOpt..47.1486J }}&lt;/ref&gt; For incoherent addition of the multiple element detectors in a random speckle field, the ratio of the mean to the standard deviation will scale as the square root of the number of independently measured speckles. This improved signal-to-noise ratio makes absolute amplitude measurements feasible in heterodyne detection.

However, as noted above, scaling physical arrays to large element counts is challenging for heterodyne detection due to the oscillating or even multi-frequency nature of the output signal.  Instead, a single-element optical detector can also act like diversity receiver via synthetic array heterodyne detection or Fourier transform heterodyne detection. With a virtual array one can then either adaptively select just one of the LO frequencies, track a slowly moving bright speckle, or add them all in post-processing by the electronics.

===Coherent temporal summation===
One can incoherently add the magnitudes of  a time series of ''N'' independent pulses to obtain a {{radic|''N''}} improvement in the signal to noise on the amplitude, but at the expense of losing the phase information.  Instead coherent addition (adding the complex magnitude and phase) of multiple pulse waveforms would improve the signal to noise by a factor of ''N'', not its square root, and preserve the phase information.  The practical limitation is adjacent pulses from typical lasers have a minute frequency drift that translates to a large random phase shift in any long distance return signal, and thus just like the case for spatially  scrambled-phase pixels, destructively interfere when added coherently. However,  coherent addition of multiple pulses is possible with advanced laser systems that narrow the frequency drift far below the difference frequency (intermediate                          frequency). This technique has been demonstrated in multi-pulse coherent Doppler [[LIDAR]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Lombardi, Jerry Butman, Torrey Lyons, David Terry, and Garrett Piech, "[http://www.phasecoherence.com/other/atmos/paper.pdf Multiple-pulse coherent laser radar waveform]"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22893">The '''''Pacific War''''' is a series of [[alternate history]] novels written by [[Newt Gingrich]] and [[William R. Forstchen]] with Albert S. Hanser. The series deals with the [[Pacific War]] between the [[United States of America]] and the [[Empire of Japan]]. The [[point of divergence]] is the decision of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], commander-in-chief of the Japanese [[Combined Fleet]], to take personal command of the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy|1st Air Fleet]] for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], rather than delegate it to Adm. [[Chūichi Nagumo]].

The first novel, ''Pearl Harbor: A Novel of December 8th'', covers the background up through the attack on the [[United States Navy]] base at [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]]. ("December&amp;nbsp;8th" is the date in Japan, on the west side of the [[International Date Line]]; the local time was December&amp;nbsp;7.)

The novel begins in Japan in 1934 where Lieutenant Commander James Watson of the US Navy and his equally-ranked friend Cecil Stanford of the [[British Royal Navy]] are guests of the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|Etajima Naval Academy]], witnessing the harsh, aggressive training of recruits. They meet friendly young Lieutenant [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the three discuss the growing military strength of Japan and the increasing political tensions across the Pacific.

In 1936, Stanford makes his report of his impressions of Japanese culture and their military &amp; political ambitions to [[Winston Churchill]]. Back in Japan, Fuchida and Commander [[Genda Minoru]] formulate the new naval doctrines in which air-power will supersede the [[battleship]] as the prime weapon of the Imperial Fleet.

In December 1937, Watson is on board the US Navy gunboat [[USS Panay incident|USS ''Panay'']] on the [[Yangtze River]] near [[Shanghai]] when it is strafed and sunk by Japanese aircraft despite the vessel clearly displaying the American flag. A few days later, Stanford, now a journalist, has the misfortune to witness, and narrowly escape (with the assistance of German businessman [[John Rabe]]), the brutal atrocities committed on the Chinese civilian population of [[Rape of Nanking|Nanking]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Fuchida and Stanford meet in China but the latter’s anger &amp; disgust over recent events causes a falling-out between the two friends.

In September 1940, Genda, now a naval attaché in [[London]], watches the [[Battle of Britain]] being fought over the English capital and he later gives his critical appraisal of the Campaign to [[United States Army Air Corps|USAAC]] Colonel [[Carl Spaatz]].

January 1941. Watson, having lost one of his hands when the ''Panay'' sank and now living in [[Hawaii]] as a civilian, is recalled to duty as an [[Intelligence officer]] in the US Navy. He and his new friend and colleague Captain Tom Collingwood are assigned the task of deciphering [[Type B Cipher Machine|Japanese coded communications]]. It proves to be a frustrating and laborious task.

February 1941. [[Admiral Yamamoto]] is advised by Genda on the crucial importance of naval airpower in the coming war with the West that seems inevitable.

June–September 1941. Fuchida strives to develop new techniques in attacking vessels in shallow-water harbors whilst Japanese [[Fumimaro Konoye|Prime-Minister Konoye]], with little authority over his country’s armed forces, reluctantly submits plans for military expansion to the Emperor for approval. Stanford is in Hanoi when he hears the news of the Japanese decision to occupy [[French Indochina]], signalling that the Japanese are prepared to openly provoke the West. The US begins an [[Export Control Act|embargo]] on oil supplies to Japan and Emperor Hirohito secretly approves plans for military action.

October–November 1941. Genda manages to convince Yamamoto to personally command the naval task force assigned to mount a surprise attack on the US naval base at [[Pearl Harbor]] on Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands. Genda and Fuchida both feel that the original choice of commander, [[Chūichi Nagumo|Admiral Nagumo]], a ‘Battleship Admiral’ of the old school, lacks both conviction and a proper understanding of the new carrier tactics. Stanford is reassigned to Singapore by the now Prime-Minister Winston Churchill to report on the growing threat in the East. The Japanese carrier fleet sets sail from Japan on November 26 (Tokyo time), bound for Hawaii. On November 28, the US carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}, Admiral [[William Halsey]] commanding, departs Pearl Harbor, bound for [[Wake Island]] with a cargo of fighter aircraft.

December 7, 1941 (December 8, Tokyo Time). The first and second waves of Japanese aircraft launched from the six fleet carriers of Yamamoto’s Imperial Task Force located north of Hawaii attack Pearl Harbor and US Naval &amp; Army airfields on [[Oahu]]. Watson witnesses at close hand the destruction of Battleship Row on Ford Island including the terrible losses of the battleships [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|''Arizona'']] and [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|''Oklahoma'']]. Fuchida, personally leading the attack, notes, as the second wave departs, that many of the harbor facilities including the main dry dock and the oil storage tanks along with all of the US submarines are still intact. Upon return to the flagship [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']], Fuchida advises Yamamoto to launch a third strike, as does Genda. The Admiral agrees but decides to send only half the available bombers, retaining the rest as a reserve in case the so far un-located US carriers should appear.

Shortly before 3pm local time, the third wave arrives over Pearl Harbor. This time, the defences are on alert, putting up a dense anti-aircraft barrage which inflicts severe losses, the strike force losing a third of its aircraft. But the attackers cause heavy damage nonetheless, destroying No 1 dry-dock, the oil tank farms and the headquarters of the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]], killing the Commander-in-Chief Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel|Kimmel]]. In addition, a number of ships left intact after the earlier attacks are sunk or damaged, including all of the submarines still moored in the harbor. Fuchida, his aircraft badly damaged, barely makes it back to his carrier. 
The novel ends with Admiral Yamamoto grimly resolved to remain in Hawaiian waters until the battle is brought to a decisive conclusion and [[William Halsey Jr.|Admiral Halsey]] on board the [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS ''Enterprise'']], less than a day’s sail from Pearl Hearbor, mounting a search for the enemy fleet that he has vowed vengeance upon.

The novel begins where the previous book left off. 1800hrs on December 7, 1941, the Japanese carrier fleet is still 150 miles north of Oahu. The three air strikes that Yamamoto has despatched to Oahu has cost him over 80 aircraft, leaving the fleet with just under 300 planes still airworthy. Yamamoto is grimly pleased with the results thus far but he is troubled by reports that the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Japanese Foreign Ministry]] failed in their mission to deliver a formal [[declaration of war]] to the US prior to the air attacks, thus allowing the Americans to brand them as ‘sneak attacks’, igniting their anger and righteous indignation.

Yamamoto knows that the US Navy possesses at least three aircraft-carriers in the Pacific theatre. He despatches two of his battleships, the [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']] and the [[Japanese battleship Kirishima|''Kirishima'']], to mount a nocturnal bombardment of Pearl Harbor, hoping to provoke a counter-strike by the US carriers, thus exposing the location of the latter. Chief-of-Staff Rear Admiral [[Ryūnosuke Kusaka|Kusaka]] expresses his grave reservations about the risks of using the battleships as bait.

Midnight, December 8 (local time). James Watson, his arm injured by shrapnel during the earlier attacks, has made his way home to his half-Japanese wife Margaret and his mother-in-law ‘Nan’ who is a [[Nisei]], a first-generation Japanese immigrant to Hawaii of whom there are many thousands living on the islands. Watson has to quickly evacuate his family when the sudden enemy bombardment of Oahu begins, causing severe damage to both the harbor and [[Honolulu]] and provoking confused return fire by US coastal batteries, [[Friendly fire|‘friendly fire]]’ adding to the casualty toll. South-west of Oahu, Admiral Halsey, furious at this latest attack, immediately orders the ''Enterprise'' to move in closer in order to launch a counter-strike.

0100hrs. The US Navy manages to deliver its first return blow when a small force of warships led by Rear-Admiral Draemel on board the destroyer [[USS Ward (DD-139)|USS ''Ward'']], engages the Japanese battleships off the coast of Oahu. The gallant American force suffers heavy losses, including the ''Ward'', taking Draemel with her along with the cruiser [[USS Minneapolis (CA-36)|USS ''Minneapolis'']] but they manage to score a torpedo hit on the ''Hiei'', crippling the large battleship.

0200hrs. Having lost a full squadron of dive-bombers the previous day at Pearl Harbor, Halsey has only 56 aircraft remaining on the ''Enterprise'' with which to engage the entire Japanese fleet. He commits half of his available bombers to a full-out search for the enemy carriers. Meanwhile, Yamamoto has divided his carriers, despatching the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryu'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Soryu|''Soryu'']], commanded by Admiral [[Jisaburō Ozawa|Ozawa]], closer to Oahu to cover the crippled ''Hiei'' and guard against attacks from the south-east whilst the rest of the carriers are north-west of the islands, covering the west flank. The Japanese launch scout-planes to find the US carriers. On Oahu, Watson, Captain Collingwood and assistant Dianne St Clair desperately try to re-organise communications to co-ordinate the groups of US warships that are scattered throughout the Pacific and now converging on Hawaii.

0630hrs. As [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] delivers his famous [[Infamy Speech|Day of Infamy]] speech in Washington, US aircraft from the ''Enterprise'' attack the ''Hiei'', further crippling her. One of Yamamoto’s scout planes locates Halsey’s task-force.

0730hrs. Aircraft from the IJN carriers ''Soryu'' and ''Hiryu'' attack Halsey’s force, sinking the cruiser [[USS Salt Lake City (CA-25)|USS ''Salt Lake City'']] and badly damaging the ''Enterprise'', leaving her still able to launch but not recover her planes. The ''Enterprise'' launches what aircraft she has left-a mere two dozen-in a counter-strike against the Japanese flat-tops.

0945hrs. The ''Enterprise''{{'}}s attack is successful, scoring two hits on the carrier ''Soryu'', leaving her temporarily out of action, but only seven planes survive to head to Oahu, including [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F]] pilot Lieutenant Dellacroce and [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|dive-bomber]] pilot Lieutenant Dan Struble.
 
1100hrs. The ''Enterprise'' is attacked again by a second wave from Ozawa’s force, the Japanese pilots believing it to be a second US carrier as Halsey’s crew had extinguished the fires from the previous strike. Struck by bombs and torpedoes, the US carrier is desperately injured, perhaps mortally. In Washington, President Roosevelt confers with [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Admiral Stark]] and [[George C. Marshall|General Marshall]], deciding that available resources need to be concentrated on defending Hawaii and that it is virtually impossible to relieve the embattled US forces defending the Philippines which have been invaded by the Imperial army.

1400hrs. US Task Force 12, comprising the carrier [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] and her escorts, led by Admiral Newton, now enters the fray, having returned from Midway atoll where she had ferried aircraft prior to the Japanese attack.

1630hrs. A tiny force of sixteen aircraft, consisting of the surviving ''Enterprise'' planes and the last handful of flyable US Army aircraft at Hickam airfield on Oahu, makes a gallant attack on Yamamoto’s main carrier force. Meeting heavy resistance, the motley flight is all but wiped out but Lt Dan Struble, dying and his aircraft afire, crash-dives into Yamamoto’s flagship carrier, the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']]. Lt Dave Dellacroce’s F4F is one of only four planes to escape.

1730hrs. The atmosphere on Oahu is fearful, tense and angry with rumours and mis-information circulating everywhere. The [[Hawaii National Guard|National Guard]] are enforcing [[martial law]]. Groggy with pain and fatigue, Watson is driven home by Dianne who has just learnt her boyfriend, an Army pilot, was killed the previous day. There is a tense episode when Dianne meets Watson’s Japanese wife &amp; mother-in-law.

1750hrs. The crippled ''Hiei'', now 30 miles south-west of Oahu, is torpedoed and sunk by the submarine [[USS Gudgeon (SS-211)|USS ''Gudgeon'']].

1915hrs. The severely damaged ''Enterprise'', thanks to a superhuman effort on the part of her crew, has managed to stay afloat and is commencing a slow, dangerous crawl to the safety of the West Coast of the US mainland.

0550hrs. December 9 (local time).  A Japanese scout plane sights the location of Task Force 12. Shortly afterwards, a US submarine signals the location of Yamamoto’s main force. Both sides launch air-strikes, the groups passing within sight of each other on the way to their respective targets. The ''Lexington'' is sunk, as is the already damaged ''Akagi''. Newton and Yamamoto abandon their respective flagships. Yamamoto orders his fleet to withdraw.

1000hrs. An angry, drunken lynch-mob threaten to execute a young Japanese boy in the street where Watson's family are staying. Margaret is attacked by a would-be rapist but Dianne, armed with a pistol, keeps the mob at bay until National Guardsmen arrive to restore order.

Evening, December 10. Yamamoto receives a summons to appear before the Emperor, most likely to account for the losses his fleet has suffered. Although his fleet has inflicted severe damage on the Americans, the decisive victory that he yearned for has not occurred. Both sides resign themselves to a [[Pacific War|long, bitter conflict]].

==Historical warships==
Although the sinkings of the {{USS|Panay|PR-5|6}}, [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']] and [[USS Oklahoma (BB-37)|USS ''Oklahoma'']] occurred in factual history as described in these alternate history novels, other warships that are damaged or sunk in the Pacific War series had, of course, different careers in real-life.

* [[USS Minneapolis (CA-36)|USS ''Minneapolis'']] — A ''New Orleans''-class heavy cruiser commissioned 1934. Fought at the battles of [[Battle of Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]] &amp; [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]]. She was badly damaged at the [[Battle of Tassafaronga]], November 1942. Survived war, decommissioned in 1947, scrapped in 1959.
* [[USS Salt Lake City (CA-25)|USS ''Salt Lake City'']] — ''Pensacola''-class heavy cruiser commissioned 1929. Escorted the [[Doolittle Raid|Doolittle Mission]] to Tokyo and was involved with the Coral Sea and Midway battles. Fought at the Battles of [[Battle of Cape Esperance|Cape Esperance]] in October 1942 and [[Battle of the Komandorski Islands|Komandorski Islands]] in March 1943 and sustained damage in both. Survived war, decommissioned in 1947, used as a target-hull for gunnery practice and sunk in 1948.
* [[USS Ward (DD-139)|USS ''Ward'']] — ''Wickes''-class destroyer commissioned 1918. Had the distinction of firing the first American shot of the Pacific War when on the early morning of December 7, 1941, she shelled and sank a Japanese midget submarine attempting to enter Pearl Harbor. Converted to a Fast Transport in 1942, she saw active duty as an escort and a transport 1943-44. She was sunk by [[Kamikaze]] attack near [[Leyte Campaign|Omac Bay, Leyte]] on December 7, 1944.
* [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] — Early US aircraft carrier, commissioned in 1927. The ship was despatched on an abortive attempt to relieve the besieged [[Wake Island]] in December 1941. She was employed in mounting air-strikes against Japanese forces in Rabaul and New Guinea in February 1942. She later fought in the Battle of Coral Sea where she was sunk by Japanese aircraft from the IJN carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shōkaku|''Shōkaku'']] on May 8, 1942.
* {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} — The sixth US carrier to be constructed, she was commissioned in 1938. She fought in every major naval battle of the Pacific War involving carriers except Coral Sea. Escorted the [[USS Hornet (CV-8)|USS ''Hornet'']] on the Doolittle mission to Tokyo. Fought at the Battle of Midway in June 1942 where her aircraft sank the IJN carriers ''Akagi'', [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']]. Fought at the Battles of the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons|Eastern Solomons]] in August 1942 and [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Santa Cruz Islands]] in October 1942 and was badly damaged in both. Was involved in the battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf in 1944. Participated in the [[Okinawa invasion]] and was twice damaged by Kamikazes in April &amp; May 1945. Decommissioned in 1947 and, despite efforts to have her preserved as a museum, was scrapped in 1958.
* [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] — Converted from an ''Amagi''-class battlecruiser, the carrier was commissioned in 1927. Was the flagship of the carrier fleet that attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Her aircraft participated in air-strikes against Allied forces in Rabaul, [[Air raids on Darwin, February 19, 1942|northern Australia]] and [[Indian Ocean raid|Ceylon]]. Fought at the Battle of Midway. Attacked and set aflame by dive-bombers from USS ''Enterprise'' on June 4, 1942. Scuttled in the early hours of June 5.
* [[Japanese aircraft carrier Soryu|''Soryu'']] — One of the first Japanese carriers to be designed from the keel up as an aircraft-carrier, she was commissioned in 1937. Participated in the Pearl Harbor operation and later was responsible for air strikes against Wake Island, northern Australia and Ceylon. Fought at the Battle of Midway. She was dive-bombed by aircraft from the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|6}} on the morning of June 4, 1942 and, mortally damaged, was scuttled that evening.
* [[Japanese battleship Hiei|''Hiei'']] — One of the ''Kongō''-class battleships, was commissioned in 1914. After Pearl Harbor, she remained as an escort for the Japanese carrier fleet on the latter’s operations in the first half of 1942. Participated in the Midway campaign and in the early actions of the Solomons campaign. Fought at the First [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]] on November 13, 1942 and was badly damaged. Attempting to withdraw the following day, she was subjected to multiple attacks by both US army and naval aircraft until she was abandoned and sunk on the evening of November 14.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25317">In [[world systems theory]], the '''periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the periphery''') are those that are less developed than the [[semi-periphery countries|semi-periphery]] and [[core countries]].  These countries usually receive [[International inequality|a disproportionately small share of global wealth]]. They have weak state institutions and are dependent on – according to some, exploited by – more developed countries. These countries are usually behind because of obstacles such as lack of technology, unstable government, and poor education and health systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/25642636/_Peripheral_Realism_Revisited_in_Revista_Brasileira_de_Pol%C3%ADtica_Internacional_59_1_1-18|title=Peripheral Realism Revisited|first1=Carlos |last1=Escudé|first2=Luis L|last2=Schenoni|publisher=|journal=Revista Brasileira de Política Internacional|volume=59|issue=1|pp=1-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, the exploitation of periphery countries' agriculture, cheap labor, and natural resources aid core countries in remaining dominant. This is best described by [[dependency theory]],&lt;ref name= Shannon&gt;Thomas Shannon. An Introduction to the World-System Perspective. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; which is one [[theory]] on how [[globalization]] can affect the world and the countries in it. It is, however, possible for periphery countries to rise out of their status and move into semi-periphery or core status. This can be done by doing things such as [[Industrialisation|industrializing]], stabilizing the government and political climate, etc.

Based on the list in Dunn, Kawana, Brewer (2000).{{update-inline|date=May 2018}}]]

==Background==

Periphery countries are those that exist on the outer edges of global trade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} There could be many reasons for a country to be considered peripheral, such as a dysfunctional or inefficient government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} For example, some nations customs and ports are so inefficient that even though they are geographically closer it is cheaper to ship goods from longer distances.&lt;ref name=dollar&gt;Dollar, David, "Globalization, Inequality, and Poverty since 1980" Development Research Group, World Bank. November 2001, Page 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Other reasons such as wars, non-central location, insufficient infrastructure (rail lines, roads and communications) will keep a country in the periphery of global trade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Generally the populations tend to be poor and destitute so the core countries will exploit them for cheap labor and will even purposely interfere with their politics to keep things this way.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Usually a peripheral country will specialize in one particular industry, leaving it vulnerable to economic instability and limiting international investment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Sometimes countries decide to isolate themselves, such as 14th century China.&lt;ref name=Before&gt;Abu-Lughod, Janet L., "Before European Hegemony" Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
There are a variety of reasons that periphery countries remain the way they are. One important factor that keeps countries in the periphery is the lack of development of [[technology]].&lt;ref name = world&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein. The Modern World System : Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. Academic press. 1976.http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Another way periphery countries come to be is either the lack of a central [[government]] or the periphery country is under the control of another country. Periphery countries are known for exporting raw goods to core countries. What tends to happen is the maximum gain a periphery nation could earn is less than needed to maintain an equilibrium between [[cost]]s and [[revenues]]. One thing periphery nations could do is to stop the increase of exports.&lt;ref name = periphery&gt;Raul Prebischb. Commercial Policy in the Underdeveloped Countries. American Economic Association. 1959.https://www.jstor.org/stable/1816120.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 19th century, Asia and Africa were considered periphery and their lack of development enabled the United States and Germany to remain successful core nations.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

Although periphery nations are exploited by core countries, there is a purpose to the unequal exchanges of goods. For instance, the core countries have an incentive to gain a [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and this enables the [[world]] [[Market (economics)|market]] to further grow. At times, there is a change in the balance of trade between the periphery and core countries. This occurs when the prices of [[exports]] from periphery countries decrease at a faster rate than the exports from core nations.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In this case, the [[governments]] of the periphery nation are affected in several ways. For instance, there is an increase in [[unemployment]] as well as a decrease in state income. This type of interaction is unique because the core country involved is somewhat weaker than normal. An example of this occurring is the growth of the industrial capabilities of [[Italy]] and [[Russia]] towards the end of the 19th century. This has also occurred in other periphery nations such as [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name= global&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein. Dependence in an Interdependent World: The Limited Possibilities of Transformation within the Capitalist World Economy. African Studies Association. April 1974.https://www.jstor.org/stable/523574.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===15th century and 16th century===
The world system at this time was much different from the world system of today.  Several areas were beginning to develop into trading powers but none were able to gain total control.  For this reason, a core and periphery developed in each region as opposed to a global scale.  Cities began to become the "core" with the more agricultural countryside becoming a sort of "periphery".  The most underdeveloped region that was still involved in trade at the time was Europe.  It had the weakest core and periphery areas.&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;

Two examples of periphery countries in the late 15th century and early 16th century are [[Poland]] and [[Latin America]]. At this time, Poland was mainly exporting wheat to other areas of [[Europe]] and Poland wanted cheap labor.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; As a result, [[landlord]]s enslaved rural workers on their estate lands. Also, Latin America experienced an enslavement of their natives and imports of [[slaves]] from [[Africa]]. Forced mining labor was placed on the slaves, which enabled Latin America to export cheap goods to Europe.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt; Both Poland and Latin America were similar during this time period because the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] of these areas became more wealthy due to their interactions with the [[world economy]]. These areas of the world were also different from during medieval times in Europe. They are different because during the late 15th century and early 16th century, Poland and Latin America were producing goods and exporting them rather than simply consuming their raw goods.&lt;ref name="world"/&gt;

==Interactions==
The relationship that the periphery countries have with the core countries is one that is defined by the exploitation of the periphery countries by the core countries. As many countries began to [[industrialize]] they looked for cheap goods and products.&lt;ref name=Kardulias&gt;P. Nick Kardulias. World Systems Theory in Practice. https://books.google.com/books?id=fFmBTldqTbsC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=core+periphery+interactions&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I6Jm-uPMEJ&amp;sig=ZhpHKHMd-vKpAB96Ewbv4T_9EEM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=J6gPTN26FIOC8gaDpvj6CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=core%20periphery%20interactions&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; These [[industrialized]] "core" countries would then look to the less developed "periphery" countries for cheap goods.  In most cases it is much easier and inexpensive to get these goods from other countries.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm&gt;Eric Hobsbawm. The Age of Empires. Vintage Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  Core countries realized this and began to use these cheap resources.

For the core countries to remain at the core, it is necessary that the periphery countries keep producing these cheap goods and remain mostly [[agricultural]].&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; The core countries are able to get goods very cheaply from the periphery and then are able to [[manufacture]] products and sell them at a relatively high price.&lt;ref name= Shannon /&gt; The periphery countries are unable to make any gains because of this relationship and it is therefore impossible for them to ever industrialize.  It is argued that if these countries are never able industrialize, they will continue to remain on the periphery.&lt;ref name= Shannon /&gt;

===Imperialism's effect on core-periphery interactions===
The current relationship between core countries and periphery countries was mostly defined in the era of [[imperialism]] that occurred in the late 19th through the early 20th centuries.  It was at this time that the countries with the strongest [[economy|economies]] and militaries began to exploit those countries with weaker states.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm /&gt;  A result of this exploitation was the tendency of underdeveloped states or [[colony|colonies]] to move more towards the production of one type of [[export]] that would then come to  dominate their land, territory and lifestyle economy.  Some examples of the time include Brazil's [[coffee]] production and Cuba's [[cigar]] production.&lt;ref name= Hobsbawm /&gt;

==Economic possibilities==
Periphery countries are continuously exploited by countries due to the exportation of surpluses of raw goods to the more technologically industrialized core countries for manufacturing and distribution.&lt;ref name=Martinez-Vela&gt;Martinez-Vela. [http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf World Systems Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306210823/http://marriottschool.byu.edu/emp/WPW/Class%209%20-%20The%20World%20System%20Perspective.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }}. ESD-83. Fall 20001.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently some of the manufacturing has been moved to periphery countries but it is still controlled and owned by the core countries. There are, however, ways in which periphery countries can rise from their poor status and become semi-periphery countries or even core countries. It is crucial for the core countries to keep exploiting the natural resources of the periphery countries and to keep the governments semi-stable or else it could cause economic unrest for the core countries as a whole.&lt;ref name = Soc&gt;Anderson, Taylor. Sociology, the essentials. Cengage Learning. February 2006. [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7s9hvROWjoC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=sociology+core+countries&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkRctPKLVL&amp;sig=_kKfeGYVSKBSGxFEHJG-s5ypyT4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Olz9S9nlA5TKMeHzzd4H&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sociology%20core%20countries&amp;f=false Sociology, the essentials]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ways to improve===
There are several ways in which periphery countries are able to escape their poor status. Some of these ways are stabilizing their governments, becoming more industrialized and using [[natural resource]]s to benefit themselves rather than core countries, and creating a better [[education system]].&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Developing a banking system that can compete on a global scale is also another way in which periphery countries can help better themselves in the global market.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt;

====Stabilized government====
One main way in which a periphery country can rise to [[semi-periphery]] or core status is through the stabilization of its government. A country with a [[dictatorship]] type government is much easier to exploit and corrupt than one with a well organized, elected government and core countries use this to their advantage.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Political unrest is usually a cause for military action from the core countries in order to protect their interests and keep a cooperative dictator or government in power.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; Once the citizens of these countries become exploited enough, they can stage a coup in order to overthrow their government and put someone who they feel will help the country into power.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt; If this is done successfully and the new leader is stays true to his/her word, the country can take the next necessary step in rising from periphery status and that is to start to industrialize.&lt;ref name = Soc/&gt;

Some [[Neo-Marxists]] believe that it would actually be best for periphery countries to cut all economic and political ties with the core countries.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt; This would, in their opinion, allow the periphery countries to develop and industrialize at their own pace instead of being exploited and driven by core countries demands. Doing this would allow these countries to spend their money on industrializing and bettering themselves, rather than importing goods from core countries. It also would allow these countries to become more independent from the core countries, causing them to move to semi-peripheral status.&lt;ref name = Politics&gt;Duncan, Webster, Switky. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mQIy4FjLEC0C&amp;pg=PA416&amp;dq=%22periphery+countries%22&amp;lr=&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22periphery%20countries%22&amp;f=false World Politics in the 21st Century]. page 416. Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Industrializing====
Most periphery countries rely almost entirely on agriculture and other natural resources such as oil, coal, and diamonds in order to gain some sort of profit, but this also keeps them from growing economically. In order for them to grow they must industrialize in order to produce finished goods for exportation around the world, instead of allowing the core countries to profit from their natural resources. Industrializing and adapting newer technology is one of the major ways in which periphery countries can begin to raise their standard of living and help increase the wealth of their citizens.&lt;ref name = Martinez-Vela/&gt; Becoming industrialized also will help to force trade to come to their cities, if they can produce goods at competitive prices, allowing them to reach out to the global market and take hold.&lt;ref name = Martinez-Vela/&gt; Once a periphery country can industrialize, and use its own resources to its own benefit, it will begin to enter semi-periphery status.

In order for a periphery country to industrialize, it must first undergo [[proto-industrialization]].&lt;ref name = proto/&gt; In this stage, a [[market economy|market-based economy]] begins to form, normally in rural areas, using agricultural products. Proto-industrialization also helps to organize the rural market in these country and allows for them to become more capitalistic. Finally, once these countries develop this style of economy, they can begin to build factories and machines.&lt;ref name = proto&gt;John Hicks. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2117187 A Theory of Economic History]. page 141. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
One of the final steps for a periphery country to rise to semi-periphery or core status is to educate its citizens.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; Raising the [[literacy]] rate allows ideas to spread more quickly through a country and also allows people to better communicate with themselves and the rest of the world. Also once universities are developed a country can begin to research new technology. Researching new technology can help a country to better compete in a global market by becoming more efficient or selling new technology and industrial techniques. If education and industry is allowed to become developed enough it is entirely possible for a periphery country to rise to [[core country]] status and become a leader in the global market.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; Another way in which periphery countries better their education system is by spending money to send university level students and staff abroad to places such as the U.S. and Europe to receive better education.&lt;ref name = Education&gt;Arnove. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1187395 Comparative Education Systems]. page 48. Comparative and International Education Society. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the people in these countries have become educated enough and they realize their place in the world economy, they can also demand help from the core countries. Although unlikely, due to the fact that the core countries rely on the exploitation of the periphery, there have been pushes for core countries to help better the periphery countries. Some of the ideas suggested are to help aid the periphery countries in developing by exploiting them less, help the periphery countries lose some of their debt and raise the prices on goods coming from these countries to allow them to be more profitable.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt; These policies are obviously not beneficial to the core countries and is mostly why they have never been adapted successfully but this is another way in which the periphery could rise to a higher status.&lt;ref name = Politics/&gt;

===Examples===

====Russia====
During the early 20th century the economy of the Russian Empire was a primarily agrarian country with isolated pockets of heavy industries. The Empire fell in 1917; the core of its industrial workers shrank from 3.6 million in 1917 to 1.5 million in 1920.&lt;ref name="R141"&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick (2008). ''The Russian Revolution''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-923767-0}}. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[Russian Civil War]] the Soviet Union was [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)#Industrialization in practice|industrialized]] under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Industrialization peaked in 1929-1932 in a [[first five-year plan|rapid campaign]] described as "a revolution from above".&lt;ref name = R121&gt;Sheila Fitzpatrick (2008). ''The Russian Revolution''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-923767-0}}. p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  Former personal private farms were [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivized]] in the early 1930s and gradually supplied with tractors and other machinery. Mechanization of farm labor, among other factors, contributed to freeing up workers for the newly built factories. In 1928-1932 alone at least ten million peasants migrated to the cities, causing "an unprecedented demographic upheaval".&lt;ref name="R141"/&gt; Industrialization allowed the country to trade in the global trade market. By the 1950s and 60s, only about 30&amp;nbsp;years after it began to industrialize, the Soviet Union was considered by most scholars a core country along with the United States.

===Adaptation===
Once a periphery country rises up to [[core countries status]] it will be more dependent on other periphery countries for natural resources. They may also start to exploit other periphery countries to continue to better themselves. One of the biggest impacts of this rise of status is the effects it has on the people of these countries. [[Health care]] is one of the first major improvements these countries will see, people will no longer die en masse from diseases such as [[malaria]] and will be better treated for [[non-communicable diseases]].&lt;ref name= "Globalization and NC disease"&gt;Beaglehole, Yach. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6T1B-49H6JNK-W&amp;_user=88470&amp;_coverDate=09%2F13%2F2003&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1349324087&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000006998&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=88470&amp;md5=e0d7ec9dbc232f5d0749b718023228d1 Globalisation and the prevention and control of non-communicable disease: the neglected chronic disease of adults].  Elsevier Ltd. 13 September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Education]] is also another way in which the citizens will benefit.&lt;ref name = Education/&gt; As a [[country]] becomes richer, it is able to build more [[schools]] and better fund the schools already built. This was seen in Russia after the [[October Revolution]]. A better educated public leads to a more efficient [[workforce]], and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in [[industry]] and [[manufacturing]]. These countries will also experience much less severe famine now that they are able to trade successfully on a [[world|global]] scale.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1266">'''Radappertization''' is a form of [[food irradiation]] which applies a dose of [[ionizing radiation]] sufficient to reduce the number and activity of viable [[microorganism]]s to such an extent that very few, if any, are detectable in the treated food by any recognized method ([[virus]]es being excepted). No [[Microorganism|microbial]] spoilage or [[toxicity]] should become detectable in a food so treated, regardless of the conditions under which it is stored, provided the packaging remains undamaged. The required dose is usually in the range of 25-45 [[Gray (unit)|kiloGrays]].&lt;ref&gt;J.F. Diehl, ''Safety of Irradiated Foods,'' Marcel Dekker, 1995, p. 99 ff. some interpretation of the meaning of this new terminology is available&lt;/ref&gt;

Radappertized foods packaged correctly will keep indefinitely.

Radappertization is derived from the combination of ''rad''iation and [[Nicolas François Appert|Appert]], the name of the French scientist and engineer who invented [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] food for the troops of [[Napoleon]].

Such overlaps are typically decorative rather than structurally supportive. Accordingly, they are usually only [[spot welding|spot welded]] and this process results in a closure that is not air or water tight.

Seam sealants are sprayed or [[extrusion|extruded]] over the joined edges of these overlaps, and they then either cure to a flexible waterproof "seal" by drying (dehydrating) in the case of water borne compositions, or thermoset irreversibly to a flexible adherent seam seal by going through an [[oven]] bake in the case of plasticized [[polyvinylchloride]] compositions. Most interior seam seals are not visible after the vehicle is finished, because they are covered by [[carpeting]], interior roof [[headliner]], or decorative trim panels. Exterior seam seals are always painted over and are referred to as "coach joint seals."

The flat-stream application with many special solutions (special nozzles) was increasingly used as the most flexible procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sca-schucker.de/en/products/applications/fad-nad.html ''FAD/NAD - sealing seams''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120909191151/http://www.sca-schucker.de/en/products/applications/fad-nad.html |date=2012-09-09 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7152">The '''Society of Wetland Scientists, Inc.''' (SWS) is an international, professional non-profit organization devoted to promoting understanding, conservation, protection, restoration, science-based management, and sustainability of [[Wetland|wetlands]].&lt;ref name=Home/&gt; SWS has members in governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations, academia and private consulting. However, Society membership is open to anyone with an interest in wetlands. SWS has always been known for being a forum for scientists and managers to meet and work together. Based in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin]], [[United States]], it has 3000+ members, worldwide.

SWS has sixteen regional [http://sws.org/Membership/chapter-membership.html chapters] around the world that provide a local resource for networking, education and other wetland-related events: Alaska, Asia, Canada, Central, China, Europe, International, Mid-Atlantic, New England, North Central, Oceania, Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain, South Atlantic, South Central, Western. SWS has nine [http://sws.org/Membership/section-membership.html sections] that work to enhance the SWS Annual Meeting by organizing symposia and workshops: [[Biogeochemistry]], Education, Global Change Ecology, [[Peatland]]s, Public Policy and Regulation, [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]], Wildlife, Wetland Restoration, and Women in Wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sws.org/sections/|title=Welcome to SWS Interest Sections|publisher=Society of Wetland Scientists|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaJ4zCsa|archivedate=February 20, 2013|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

SWS has been managed by an [[association management company]], AMPED Association Management, since 2010. SWS is associated with the SWS Professional Certification Program, which works "to identify qualified individuals to assess and manage the Nation’s resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Society of Wetland Scientists Professional Certification Program |publisher=Society of Wetland Scientists |url=http://www.wetlandcert.org/ |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaIIGucg |archivedate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certification program is run by a separate office and collects separate membership dues.

SWS was founded in March 1980 by Richard Macomber, a biologist with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] Board of Rivers and Harbors. That same year, the first SWS Annual Meeting was held in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. The first president of SWS was James F. Parnell from the [[University of North Carolina Wilmington]].&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; The first issue of ''Wetlands'', the Society's premier, international journal, was published in 1981 as proceedings for the Annual Meeting. Since that time, ''Wetlands'' has evolved into a quarterly journal, communicating research to an expanding community of international and interdisciplinary wetland professionals. It is currently published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] on behalf of the SWS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SWS Journal WETLANDS |publisher=Society of Wetland Scientists |url=http://www.sws.org/wetlands/ |accessdate=February 20, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6EaIP5a5d |archivedate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8442">'''Glacial surges''' are short-lived events where a [[glacier]] can advance substantially, moving at velocities up to 100 times faster than normal.  Surging glaciers cluster around a few areas. High concentrations of surging glaciers occur in [[Svalbard]], the [[Canadian Arctic islands]], [[Alaska]] and [[Iceland]]. In some glaciers, surges can occur in fairly regular cycles, with 15 to 100 or more surge events per year. In other glaciers, surging remains unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;Summerfield, Michael A., 1991, ''Global Geomorphology, an introduction to the study of landforms,'' Pearson, Prentice Hall. Harlow, England&lt;/ref&gt; In some glaciers, however, the period of stagnation and build-up between two surges typically lasts 10 to 200 years and is called the quiescent phase.&lt;ref name=Dowdeswell&gt;
Dowdeswell, J. A., B. Unwin, A. M. Nuttall and D. J. Wingham. 1999. Velocity structure, flow instability and mass flux on a large Arctic ice cap from satellite radar interferometry. Elsevier Science B.V.
&lt;/ref&gt;
During this period the velocities of the glacier are significantly lower, and the glaciers can [[glacier retreat|retreat]] substantially.

==Types==

Glacier surges have been divided into two categories depending on the character of the surge event. Glaciers in Alaska exhibit surges with a sudden onset, extremely high (tens of meters/day)maximum flow rate and a sudden termination, often with a discharge of stored water. These are called Alaskan-type surges and it is suspected that these surges are hydrologically controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, M., 1988, ''Surging glaciers: geomorphic effects,'' Progress in Physical geography, http://ppg.sagepub.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Surges in Svalbard typically exhibit different behavior. Svalbard surges are typically associated with slower onset with an acceleration phase, rising to a maximum velocity which is typically slower (up to four or five meters per day) than Alaskan surges, and a return to quiessence often taking years.&lt;ref name=JJ&gt;Jiskoot, H. and D. T. Juhlin, 2009, ''Surge of a small East Greenland glacier, 2001–2007, suggests Svalbard-type surge mechanism,'' Journal of Glaciology, Vol. 55, No. 191, pp. 567–570&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, T., T. Strozzi, A. Luckman, H. Jiskoot, and P. Christakos (2003), ''Is there a single surge mechanism? Contrasts in dynamics between glacier surges in Svalbard and other regions,'' J. Geophys. Res., 108(B5), 2237, {{doi|10.1029/2002JB001906}} &lt;/ref&gt;  Features observed during the active or surge phase include [[pothole]]s, known as lacunas&lt;ref&gt;Post, A. 1969, ''Distribution of surging glaciers in western North America,'' J. Glaciol., 8(53), 229-240.&lt;/ref&gt; and medial moraines.&lt;ref&gt;Benn, Douglas I. and David J. A. Evans, ''Glaciers and Glaciation,'' Hodder Arnold, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-340-58431-6}} (verification and page number needed)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of events==
In the Norwegian Arctic, Svalbard is an [[archipelago]] containing hundreds of glaciers. Svalbard is more than 60% covered by glaciers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.hi.is/~oi/svalbard_geology.htm |title=Ingólfsson, Ólafur, '&amp;#39;Outline of the Physical Geography and Geology of Svalbard'&amp;#39; |publisher=.hi.is |date= |accessdate=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of these glaciers, hundreds have been observed to surge.&lt;ref name=Dowdeswell/&gt;

Glacial surges in Karakoram occur in the presence of "extreme uplift and denudation."&lt;ref name=Dowdeswell/&gt;

In 1980, there were several mini-surges of Variegated Glacier in Alaska. Mini surges typically show lag times of [[basal flow]] of 5–10 hours, which correlates to differences between the surging part of a glacier and the output of water and sediment.&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt; When the 1982 surge ended on July 5, there was a large flood event that day, and more flooding in the following days. What Humphrey found in his study is that behind the glacial surge zone, there are predominantly low basal water velocities, and high sliding rates before the rapid release of large quantities of water.&lt;ref name=Humphrey&gt;Humphrey, Neil Frank. Basal Hydrology of a Surge-Type Glacier: Observations and Theory Relating to Variegated Glacier. University of Washington, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There have been many theories of why glacial surges occur.

===Hydrological control===
Surges may be caused by the supply of meltwater to the base of a glacier. Meltwater is important in reducing frictional forces to glacial ice flow. The distribution and pressure of water at the bed modulates the glacier's velocity and therefore mass balance. Meltwater may come from a number of sources, including [[supraglacial lake]]s, geothermal heating of the bed, conduction of heat into the glacier and latent heat transfers. There is a positive feedback between velocity and friction at the bed, high velocities will generate more frictional heat and create more meltwater. [[crevasse|Crevassing]] is also enhanced by greater velocity flow which will provide further rapid transmission paths for meltwater flowing towards the bed. However, Humphrey found no precise correlation between ice-slow down and the release of water inside of a glacier.&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt;

The evolution of the drainage system under the glacier plays a key role in surge cycles.

===Thermal regime===

Glaciers that exhibit surges like those in Svalbard; with slower onset phase, and a longer termination phase may be thermally controlled rather than Hydrologically controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, A. C., Murray, T. and Ng, F.S.L., ''Thermal regulation of glacier surging,'' Journal of Glaciology, 47(159), 527-538, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JJ/&gt; These surges tend to last for longer periods of time than Hydrologically controlled surges.

===Deformable bed hypothesis===
In other cases, the [[geology]] of the underlying country rock may dictate surge frequency.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  For example, poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks are more prone to failure under stress; a sub-glacial "landslip" may permit the glacier to slide.  This explains why surging glaciers tend to cluster in certain areas.

===Critical mass===

Meier and Post&lt;ref&gt;Meier, M.F. and Post, A.S., 1969, ''What are glacier surges?'' Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 6, 807-817&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that once mass accumulates to a critical point, basal melting begins to occur.  This provides a buoyancy force, "lifting" the glacier from the bed and reducing the friction force.

The '''Sutter's Mill meteorite''' is a [[carbonaceous chondrite]] which entered the Earth's [[atmosphere]] and broke up at about 07:51 [[Pacific time]] on April 22, 2012, with fragments landing in the United States.&lt;ref name=discovery/&gt;&lt;ref name="radar"/&gt; The name comes from the [[Sutter's Mill]], a [[California Gold Rush]] site, near which some pieces were recovered.&lt;ref name="MetBull"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marchis"/&gt; This was the largest meteoroid impact over land since asteroid [[2008 TC3]]. Meteor astronomer [[Peter Jenniskens]] assigned SM numbers to each [[meteorite]], with the documented find location preserving information about where a given meteorite was located in the impacting meteoroid. As of May 2014, 79 fragments had been publicly documented with a find location. The largest (SM53) weighs {{convert|205|g}},&lt;ref name="Gilmer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt; and the second largest (SM50) weighs {{convert|42|g}}.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt;

The meteorite was found to contain some of the oldest material in the [[solar system]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/347199/description/California_meteorite_a_scientific_gold_mine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/news/us-meteorite-was-fastest-on-record-1.12095&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/one-of-the-fastest-rarest-meteorites-recovered-in-californias-gold-county-2012-12&lt;/ref&gt; Two 10-micron diamond grains ([[xenolith]]s) were found in the meteorite recovered before the rain fell.&lt;ref name="Ames141110"/&gt; In primitive meteorites like Sutter's Mill, some grains survived from what existed in the cloud of gas, dust and ice that formed the solar system.

==History==
During the 2012 [[Lyrids]] meteor shower, a [[bolide]] and [[sonic boom]] rattled buildings in [[California]] and [[Nevada]] in daylight conditions in the early morning at 07:51 [[Pacific Daylight Time|PDT]] on 22 April 2012.&lt;ref name="RGJ"/&gt; The bolide [[air burst]] was caused by a random [[meteoroid]], not a member of the Lyrids shower.&lt;ref name="EarthSky"/&gt; The bolide was so bright that witnesses were seeing spots afterward.&lt;ref name="RGJ-photo"/&gt;  The falling meteorites were detected by [[weather radar]] over an area centered on the Sutter's Mill site in Coloma, between [[Auburn, California]], and [[Placerville, California]].&lt;ref name="radar"/&gt;

Robert Ward found a small [[CM chondrite]] fragment in the Henningsen Lotus Park just west of [[Coloma, CA]] on 24 April 2012.&lt;ref name="chondrite"/&gt; Later that day, [[Peter Jenniskens]] found a crushed 4&amp;nbsp;g meteorite in the parking lot of that same park and Brien Cook found a 5&amp;nbsp;g meteorite off Petersen Road in Lotus.  These were the only meteorites found before rain hit the area on 25 April.

On 1 May 2012, the James W. [[Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park]]'s [[California Rangers|Ranger]] Suzie Matin discovered two pieces of the meteorite (SM14 @ 11.5 grams) in her front yard. The park contains what is now known as Sutter's Mill (site).&lt;ref name="Suzi"/&gt; On 3 May 2012 scientists with the [[Ames Research Center]] and the [[SETI Institute]] utilized an [[airship]] to search the [[strewn field]] for the impact scars of kg-sized meteorites, but it is now understood that the high entry speed prevented the survival of meteorites as large as found in the [[Murchison meteorite]] fall.&lt;ref name="airship"/&gt; Ground-based searches resulted in the additional recovery of two pristinely collected meteorites (SM12 and SM67) for scientific study.

==Comparisons==
This is the third witnessed [[meteorite fall]] in California, following Red Canyon Lake on 11 August 2007 and San Juan Capistrano on 15 March 1973, while a few months after this event the [[Novato meteorite]] fell on 17 October 2012.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

A consortium of over 50 scientists investigated the circumstances of the impact and the properties of the meteorites.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt; The event was recorded by two [[infrasound]] monitoring stations of the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization]]’s International Monitoring System.&lt;ref name="RGJ-size"/&gt; The preliminary analysis are indicative of energy yield of approximately 4 [[Nuclear weapon yield|kilotons of TNT]] equivalent.&lt;ref name="RGJ-size"/&gt; Hiroshima's "[[Little Boy]]" had a yield of about 16&amp;nbsp;kt.  The air burst had approximate coordinates of {{Coord|37.6|-120.5}}.&lt;ref name="meteorobs"/&gt;

Based on the infrasound signal and the brightness of the fireball in photographs and two video records, the incoming meteoroid was estimated to have been 2–4 meters in diameter, between the size of a [[dish washer]]&lt;ref name="KTVN"/&gt; and a [[mini van]].&lt;ref name="NASA2012-114"/&gt; Before entry in Earth's atmosphere, the meteoroid probably had an [[Absolute magnitude#Solar System bodies (H)|absolute magnitude]] (H) of roughly 31.&lt;ref name="MPC-H"/&gt; The meteoroid entered at a record speed of 28.6 ± 0.7&amp;nbsp;km/s, the fastest fireball on record from which meteorites were later recovered.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt; It broke apart at an altitude of 48&amp;nbsp;km, the highest breakup event on record resulting in meteorites on the ground.

Before entry, the meteoroid moved on an eccentric orbit, stretching from just inside the orbit of Jupiter to the orbit of Mercury. The orbit had a shallow inclination and an orbital period suggesting that this meteoroid originated in the 3:1 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The CM chondrite [[Maribo (chondrite)|Maribo]] moved on a similar orbit, but rotated by 120 degrees in the direction of the line of [[apsis|apsides]]. The asteroid family that is the source region of CM chondrite-type meteorites is now thought to be located close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance, in low-inclined orbits, and may be the [[495 Eulalia|Eulalia]] asteroid family.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt;

The meteorite type is similar to that of the 1969 [[Murchison meteorite]] in Australia. Unlike Muchison, Sutter's Mill shows clear brecciation: fragments of CM lithologies with different aqueous alteration and thermal processing histories are embedded in a fine grained CM matrix material. The Sutter's Mill meteorite originated from near the surface of its parent body. As a whole, Sutter's Mill is harder than Murchison.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt;

The pre-rain collected meteorite SM2 was found to contain the mineral oldhamite (CaS), a mineral that reacts readily with water vapor. This xenolithic material may have come from enstatite chondrites impacting on the surface of the CM chondrite parent body in the past.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt;

The Sutter's Mill meteorite is used to test sample collection and analysis procedures for NASA's [[OSIRIS-REx]] sample return mission.&lt;ref name="sm"/&gt;

[[File:Clou45.jpg |thumb|1820 edition, C. &amp; J. Ollier, London.]]
[[File:Prometheuscover.jpg |thumb|1820 cover of ''Prometheus Unbound'', C. and J. Ollier, London.]]
"'''The Cloud'''" is a major 1820 poem written by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. "The Cloud" was written during late 1819 or early 1820, and submitted for publication on 12 July 1820. The work was published in the 1820 collection ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]], A Lyrical Drama, in Four Acts, With Other Poems'' by [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]] in London in August 1820. The work was proof-read by John Gisborne. There were multiple drafts of the poem. The poem consists of six stanzas in [[anapestic]] or antidactylus meter, a foot with two unaccented syllables followed by an accented syllable.

==Analysis==

The cloud is a metaphor for the unending cycle of nature: "I silently laugh at my own cenotaph/ ... I arise and unbuild it again." As with the wind and the leaves in "[[Ode to the West Wind]]", the skylark in "[[To a Skylark]]", and the plant in "The Sensitive Plant", Shelley endows the cloud with sentient traits that personify the forces of nature.

In "The Cloud", Shelley relies on the imagery of transformation or metamorphosis, a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth: "I change, but I cannot die." [[Mutability (poem)|Mutability]] or change is a fact of physical nature.&lt;ref&gt;MacEachen, Dougald B. "CliffsNotes on Shelley's Poems". ''CliffsNotes''. Retrieved 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lightning]] or [[electricity]] is the "pilot" or guide for the cloud. Lightning is attracted to the "[[Jinn|genii]]" in the earth which results in lightning flashes. The genii symbolize the positive charge of the surface of the earth while the cloud possesses a negative charge.

British scientist and poet [[Erasmus Darwin]], the grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], had written about plant life and science in the poem collection ''[[The Botanic Garden]]'' (1791) and on "spontaneous vitality", that "microscopic animals are said to remain dead for many days or weeks ... and quickly to recover life and motion" when water and heat are added, in ''The Temple of Nature'' (1803).&lt;ref&gt;[http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Darwin/an01.html ''The Temple of Nature'' By Erasmus Darwin. {1} ADDITIONAL NOTES. SPONTANEOUS VITALITY OF MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS. Hence without parent by spontaneous birth/Rise the first specks of animated earth. CANTO I. l. 227.]&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Bysshe Shelley had cited Darwin in his Preface to the anonymously published novel ''[[Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818), explaining how the novel was written and its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780198127482.book.1/actrade-9780198127482-work-17 Preface to ''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1279684 | pmid=11983772 | volume=95 | title=The real Doctor Frankenstein? | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=257–9 | last1 = Goulding | first1 = C | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that imparting life to a corpse "as not of impossible occurrence".

The cloud is a personification and a metaphor for the perpetual cycle of transformation and change in nature. All life and matter are interconnected and undergo unending change and metamorphosis.

==Reception==

A review of the 1820 ''Prometheus Unbound'' collection in the September and October 1821 issues of ''The London Magazine'' noted the originality of "The Cloud": "It is impossible to peruse them without admiring the peculiar property of the author's mind, which can doff in an instant the cumbersome garments of metaphysical speculations, and throw itself naked as it were into the arms of nature and humanity. The beautiful and singularly original poem of 'The Cloud' will evince proofs of our opinion, and show the extreme force and freshness with which the writer can impregnate his poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Barcus 1975 qtd p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 1821 issue of ''Quarterly Review'', W.S. Walker argued that "The Cloud" is related to ''Prometheus Unbound'' in that they are both absurd and "galimatias".&lt;ref&gt;Barcus 1975 qtd p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Todhunter wrote in 1880 that "The Cloud" and "To a Skylark" were "the two most popular of Shelley's lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;Todhunter 1880 pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Francis Thompson asserted that "The Cloud" was the "most typically Shelleyan of all the poems" because it contained "the child's faculty of make-believe raised to the nth power" and that "He is still at play, save only that his play is such as manhood stops to watch, and his playthings are those which the gods give their children. The universe is his box of toys. He dabbles his fingers in the dayfall. He is gold-dusty with tumbling amidst the stars."&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 1909 qtd. p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1919 movie==
On 20 April 1919, a silent black and white movie was released in the US entitled ''The Cloud'' which was "a visual poem featuring clouds and landscapes in accompaniment to the words of Shelley's poem 'The Cloud'." The film was directed by W.A. Van Scoy and produced by the Post Nature Pictures company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010012/ IMDB link to ''The Cloud'' (1919).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]], in particular [[quantum mechanics]], the '''vector model of the atom''' is a [[Mathematical model|model]] of the [[atom]] in terms of [[angular momentum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Quanta: A handbook of concepts'', P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974, {{ISBN|0-19-855493-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered as the extension of the [[Bohr model|Rutherford-Bohr-Sommerfeld atom model]] to multi-electron atoms.

==Introduction==

[[File:Vector model of orbital angular momentum.svg|250px|left|thumb|Illustration of the vector model of orbital angular momentum.]]

The model is a convenient representation of the angular momenta of the electrons in the atom. Angular momentum is always split into orbital '''L''', spin '''S''' and total '''J''':
:&lt;math&gt;\bold{J}=\bold{L}+\bold{S}.&lt;/math&gt;
Given that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized and there is an uncertainty relation for the components of each vector, the representation turns out to be quite simple (although the background mathematics is quite complex). Geometrically it is a discrete set of right-circular cones, without the circular base, in which the axes of all the cones are lined up onto a common axis, conventionally the z-axis for three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates.&lt;ref&gt;''Physical chemistry'', P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1978, {{ISBN|0-19-855148-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following is the background to this construction.

===Mathematical background of angular momenta===

[[File:Spin half angular momentum.svg|260px|thumb|Cones of spin angular momentum, here shown for a spin-1/2 particle]]

The commutator implies that for each of '''L''', '''S''', and '''J''', only one component of any angular momentum vector can be measured at any instant of time; at the same the other two are indeterminate. The commutator of any two angular momentum operators (corresponding to component directions) is non-zero. Following is a summary of the relevant mathematics in constructing the vector model.

The commutation relations are (using the [[Einstein summation convention]]):

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; [\hat{L}_a, \hat{L}_b ] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{abc} \hat{L}_c \\
&amp; [\hat{S}_a, \hat{S}_b ] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{abc} \hat{S}_c \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where 
*'''L''' = (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), '''S''' = (''S''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and '''J''' = (''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) (these correspond to '''L''' = (''L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''L&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''L&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''), '''S''' = (''S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''S&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') and '''J''' = (''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') in Cartesian coordinates),
*''a'', ''b'', ''c'' ∊ {1,2,3} are indices labelling the components of angular momenta
*''ε&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the 3-index [[permutation tensor]] in 3-d.

The magnitudes of '''L''', '''S''' and '''J''' however ''can'' be measured at the same time, since the commutation of the square of an angular momentum operator (full resultant, not components) with any one component is zero, so simultaneous measurement of &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}_a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\hat{L}^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}_a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\hat{S}^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{J}_a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\hat{J}^2&lt;/math&gt; satisfy:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
&amp; [\hat{L}_a, \hat{L}^2] = 0\\
&amp; [\hat{S}_a, \hat{S}^2] = 0\\
&amp; [\hat{J}_a, \hat{J}^2] = 0\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The magnitudes satisfy all of the following, in terms of operators and vector components:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
&amp; \hat{L}^2 = \hat{L}_x^2 + \hat{L}_y^2 +\hat{L}_z^2 \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, \bold{L}\cdot\bold{L}= L^2 = L_x^2 + L_y^2 + L_z^2,\\
&amp; \hat{S}^2 = \hat{S}_x^2 + \hat{S}_y^2 +\hat{S}_z^2 \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, \bold{S}\cdot\bold{S}= S^2 = S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2,\\
&amp; \hat{J}^2 = \hat{J}_x^2 + \hat{J}_y^2 +\hat{J}_z^2 \,\, \rightleftharpoons \,\, \bold{J}\cdot\bold{J}= J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2,\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

and quantum numbers:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; |\bold{L}| = \hbar \sqrt{\ell(\ell+1)}, \quad L_z = m_\ell \hbar, \\
&amp; |\bold{S}| = \hbar \sqrt{s(s+1)}, \quad S_z = m_s \hbar, \\
&amp; |\bold{J}| = \hbar \sqrt{j(j+1)}, \quad J_z = m_j \hbar, \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

where 
*&lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \ell &lt;/math&gt;, is the [[azimuthal quantum number]],
*''s'', is the [[spin quantum number]] intrinsic to the type of particle,
*''j'', is the [[total angular momentum quantum number]],

which respectively take the values:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
&amp; m_\ell \in \{ -\ell, -(\ell-1) \cdots \ell-1, \ell \} , \quad \ell \in \{ 0,1 \cdots n-1 \} \\
&amp; m_s \in \{ -s, -(s-1) \cdots s-1, s \} , \\
&amp; m_j \in \{ -j, -(j-1) \cdots j-1, j  \} , \\
&amp; m_j=m_\ell+m_s, \quad j=|\ell+s|\\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

These mathematical facts suggest the continuum of all possible angular momenta for a corresponding specified quantum number:

#One direction is constant, the other two are variable.
#The magnitude of the vectors must be constant (for a specified state corresponding to the quantum number), so the two indeterminate components of each of the vectors must be confined to a circle, in such a way that the measurable and un-measurable components (at an instant of time) allow the magnitudes to be constructed correctly, for all possible indeterminate components.

The geometrical result is a cone of vectors, the vector starts at the apex of the cone and its tip reaches the circumference of the cone. It is convention to use the z-component for the measurable component of angular momentum, so the axis of the cone must be the z-axis, directed from the apex to the plane defined by the circular base of the cone, perpendicular to the plane. For different quantum numbers, the cones are different. So there are a ''discrete'' number of states the angular momenta can be, ruled by the above possible values for &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \ell&lt;/math&gt;, ''s'', and ''j''. Using the previous set-up of the vector as part of a cone, each state must correspond to a cone. This is for increasing &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \ell&lt;/math&gt;, ''s'', and ''j'', and decreasing &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \ell&lt;/math&gt;, ''s'', and ''j''&gt; Negative quantum numbers correspond to cones reflected in the ''x''-''y'' plane. One of these states, for a quantum number equal to zero, clearly doesn't correspond to a cone, only a circle in the ''x''-''y'' plane.

The number of cones (including the degenerate planar circle) equals the multiplicity of states, &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle 2\ell+1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Bohr model===

It can be considered the extension of the [[Bohr model]] because [[Niels Bohr]] also proposed angular momentum was quantized according to:
:&lt;math&gt; L = m\hbar&lt;/math&gt;
where ''m'' is an integer, produced correct results for the Hydrogen atom. Although the Bohr model doesn't apply to multi-electron atoms, it was the first successful quantization of angular momentum applied to the atom, preceding the vector model of the atom.

==Addition of angular momenta==

For one-electron atoms (i.e. hydrogen), there is only one set of cones for the orbiting electron. For multi-electron atoms, there are many states, due to the increasing number of electrons.

The angular momenta of all electrons in the atom [[Vector calculus#Vector operations|add vectorially]]. Most atomic processes, both [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[Chemical reaction|chemical]] (electronic) – except in the absolutely [[stochastic]] process of [[radioactive decay]] - are determined by [[Angular momentum coupling|spin-pairing and coupling of angular momenta]] due to neighbouring [[nucleon]]s and electrons. The term "coupling" in this context means the vector superposition of angular momenta, that is, magnitudes and directions are added.  

In multi-electron atoms, the vector sum of two angular momenta is:

:&lt;math&gt; \bold{J} = \bold{J}_1 + \bold{J}_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

for the z-component, the projected values are:

:&lt;math&gt; J_z = J_{1z} + J_{2z} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
&amp; \bold{J}_z = m_j \hbar \\
&amp; \bold{J}_{1z} = m_{j_1} \hbar \\
&amp; \bold{J}_{2z} = m_{j_2} \hbar \\
\end{align} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

and the magnitudes are:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
&amp; |\bold{J}| = \hbar\sqrt{j(j+1)} \\
&amp; |\bold{J}_1| = \hbar\sqrt{j_1(j_1+1)} \\
&amp; |\bold{J}_2| = \hbar\sqrt{j_2(j_2+1)} \\
\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;

in which

:&lt;math&gt; j \in \{ |j_1 - j_2|, |j_1 - j_2| - 1 \cdots j_1 + j_2 - 1, j_1 + j_2 \} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

This process may be repeated for a third electron, then the fourth etc. until the total angular momentum has been found.

==LS coupling==
{{main|LS coupling}}

[[File:LS coupling.svg|250px|left|thumb|Illustration of L-S coupling. Total angular momentum '''J''' is purple, orbital '''L''' is blue, and spin '''S''' is green.]]
The process of adding all angular momenta together is a laborious task, since the resultant momenta is not definite, the entire cones of precessing momenta about the z-axis must be incorporated into the calculation. This can be simplified by some developed approximations - such as the ''Russell-Saunders coupling'' scheme in [[Angular momentum coupling#Spin-orbit coupling|L-S coupling]], named after H. N. Russell and F. A. Saunders (1925).&lt;ref&gt;H. N. Russell and F. A. Saunders, New Regularities in the Spectra of the Alkaline Earths, Astrophysical Journal, vol. 61, p. 38 (1925)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''volcano''' is a [[rupture (engineering)|rupture]] in the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of a [[planetary-mass object]], such as [[Earth]], that allows hot [[lava]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[Volcanic gas|gases]] to escape from a [[magma chamber]] below the surface.

Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]] that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enviroliteracy.org/nsfmod/NaturesFury.pdf |title=Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Tsunamis |work=Resources for Environmental Literacy |author=NSTA Press / Archive.Org |date=2007 |accessdate=April 22, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913041924/http://www.enviroliteracy.org/nsfmod/NaturesFury.pdf |archivedate=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are [[Divergent boundary|diverging]] or [[Convergent boundary|converging]], and most are found underwater. For example, a [[mid-oceanic ridge]], such as the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the [[East African Rift]] and the [[Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field]] and [[Rio Grande Rift]] in North America. This type of volcanism falls under the umbrella of "plate hypothesis" volcanism.&lt;ref name=Foulger&gt;{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |last1=Foulger|first1= Gillian R. |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanism away from plate boundaries has also been explained as [[mantle plume]]s. These so-called "[[hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]", for example Hawaii, are postulated to arise from upwelling [[diapir]]s with magma from the [[core–mantle boundary]], 3,000&amp;nbsp;km deep in the Earth.  Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.

Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. One such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with [[jet engine]]s where ash particles can be melted by the high [[operating temperature]]; the melted particles then adhere to the [[turbine]] blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of [[sulfuric acid]] obscure the [[sun]] and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere (or [[troposphere]]); however, they also absorb heat radiated from the Earth, thereby warming the upper atmosphere (or [[stratosphere]]). Historically, [[volcanic winter]]s have caused catastrophic [[famine]]s.

==Etymology==
The word ''volcano'' is derived from the name of [[Vulcano]], a volcanic island in the [[Aeolian Islands]] of Italy whose name in turn comes from [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the god of fire in [[Roman mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7694.html |title=Volcano |work=Mind over Magma: The Story of Igneous Petrology |first1=Davis A.|last1=Young |date=January 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112071530/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7694.html |archivedate=November 12, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of volcanoes is called [[volcanology]], sometimes spelled ''vulcanology''.

==Plate tectonics==
[[File:Spreading ridges volcanoes map-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map showing the divergent plate boundaries (oceanic spreading ridges) and recent sub-aerial volcanoes]]
{{Main|Plate tectonics}}

===Divergent plate boundaries===
{{Main|Divergent boundary}}
At the [[mid-oceanic ridges]], two [[tectonic plate]]s diverge from one another as new [[oceanic crust]] is formed by the cooling and solidifying of hot molten rock. Because the crust is very thin at these ridges due to the pull of the tectonic plates, the release of pressure leads to [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] expansion (without transfer of heat or matter) and the partial melting of the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most [[divergent boundary|divergent plate boundaries]] are at the bottom of the oceans; therefore, most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. [[Black smoker]]s (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea-level, volcanic islands are formed; for example, [[Iceland]].

===Convergent plate boundaries===
{{Main|Convergent boundary}}
[[Subduction]] zones are places where two plates, usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate, collide. In this case, the oceanic plate subducts, or submerges, under the continental plate, forming a deep ocean trench just offshore. In a process called [[flux melting]], water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge, thus creating [[magma]]. This magma tends to be extremely  [[viscous]] because of its high [[silica]] content, so it often does not attain the surface but cools and solidifies at depth.  When it does reach the surface, however, a volcano is formed. Typical examples are [[Mount Etna]] and the volcanoes in the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

===Hotspots===
{{Main|Hotspot (geology)}}
[[Hotspot (geology)|Hotspots]] are volcanic areas believed to be formed by [[mantle plume]]s, which are hypothesized to be columns of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary in a fixed space that causes large-volume melting. Because tectonic plates move across them, each volcano becomes dormant and is eventually re-formed as the plate advances over the postulated plume. The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are said to have been formed in such a manner; so has the [[Snake River Plain]], with the [[Yellowstone Caldera]] being the part of the North American plate above the hot spot. This theory, however, has been doubted.&lt;ref name="Foulger"/&gt;

==Volcanic features==
[[File:Lakagigar Iceland 2004-07-01.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Laki|Lakagigar]] fissure vent in [[Iceland]], the source of the [[Laki#Consequences in Iceland|major world climate alteration of 1783–84]], has a chain of volcanic cones along its length.]]
[[File:Skjaldbreidur Herbst 2004.jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Skjaldbreiður]], a shield volcano whose name means "broad shield"]]
The most common perception of a volcano is of a [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] mountain, spewing [[lava]] and poisonous [[volcanic gas|gases]] from a [[volcanic crater|crater]] at its summit; however, this describes just one of the many types of volcano.  The features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors. Some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by [[lava dome]]s rather than a summit crater while others have [[landscape]] features such as massive [[plateau]]s. Vents that issue volcanic material (including [[lava]] and [[volcanic ash|ash]]) and gases (mainly [[Volcano#Effects of volcanoes|steam and magmatic gases]]) can develop anywhere on the [[landform]] and may give rise to smaller cones such as [[Pu'u 'Ō'ō|Pu{{okina}}u {{okina}}Ō{{okina}}ō]] on a flank of Hawaii's [[Kīlauea]].
Other types of volcano include [[cryovolcano]]es (or ice volcanoes), particularly on some moons of [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and [[Neptune]]; and [[mud volcano]]es, which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity. Active mud volcanoes tend to involve temperatures much lower than those of [[igneous]] volcanoes except when the mud volcano is actually a vent of an igneous volcano.

===Fissure vents===
{{Main|Fissure vent}}
Volcanic '''fissure vents''' are flat, linear fractures through which [[lava]] emerges.

===Shield volcanoes===
{{Main|Shield volcano}}
'''Shield volcanoes''', so named for their broad, shield-like profiles, are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow a great distance from a vent. They generally do not explode catastrophically. Since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica, shield volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings. The Hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of shield cones, and they are common in [[Iceland]], as well.

===Lava domes===
{{Main|Lava dome}}
'''Lava domes''' are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava. They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption, as in the case of [[Mount Saint Helens]], but can also form independently, as in the case of [[Lassen Peak]]. Like stratovolcanoes, they can produce violent, explosive eruptions, but their lava generally does not flow far from the originating vent.

===Cryptodomes===
'''Cryptodomes''' are formed when viscous lava is forced upward causing the surface to bulge. The [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] was an example; lava beneath the surface of the mountain created an upward bulge which slid down the north side of the mountain.

===Volcanic cones (cinder cones)===
{{Main|volcanic cone|Cinder cone}}
[[File:Green Izalco Volcano.JPG|thumb|[[Izalco (volcano)]], located in the [[Cordillera de Apaneca]] volcanic range complex in El Salvador. Only a few generations old, Izalco is the youngest volcano in El Salvador. Izalco erupted almost continuously from 1770 (when it formed) to 1958, earning it the nickname of "Lighthouse of the Pacific".]]

'''Volcanic cones''' or '''cinder cones''' result from eruptions of mostly small pieces of [[scoria]] and [[pyroclastics]] (both resemble cinders, hence the name of this volcano type) that build up around the vent. These can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters high. Most cinder cones erupt only [[monogenetic volcanic field|once]]. Cinder cones may form as [[parasitic cone|flank vents]] on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own.  [[Parícutin]] in Mexico and [[Sunset Crater]] in [[Arizona]] are examples of cinder cones.  In [[New Mexico]], [[Caja del Rio]] is a [[volcanic field]] of over 60 cinder cones.

Based on satellite images it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the Solar system too; on the surface of Mars and the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=C.A.|title=Cindercones on Earth, Moon and Mars|journal=Lunar and Planetary Science |volume=X|date=1979|pages=1370–1372|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1979LPI....10.1370W|bibcode=1979LPI....10.1370W}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Meresse | first1 = S. | last2 = Costard | first2 = F.

{{Main|Stratovolcano}}
'''Stratovolcanoes''' or '''composite volcanoes''' are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and other ejecta in alternate layers, the [[stratum|strata]] that gives rise to the name. Stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions. Strato/composite volcanoes are made of cinders, ash, and lava. Cinders and ash pile on top of each other, lava flows on top of the ash, where it cools and hardens, and then the process repeats. Classic examples include [[Mount Fuji]] in Japan, [[Mayon Volcano]] in the Philippines, and [[Mount Vesuvius]] and [[Stromboli]] in Italy.

Throughout [[recorded history]], [[volcanic ash|ash]] produced by the [[explosive eruption]] of stratovolcanoes has posed the greatest volcanic hazard to civilizations. Not only do stratovolcanoes have greater pressure buildup from the underlying lava flow than shield volcanoes, but their fissure vents and [[monogenetic volcanic field]]s (volcanic cones) also have more powerful eruptions because they are often under [[extension (geology)|extension]]. They are also steeper than shield volcanoes, with slopes of 30–35° compared to slopes of generally 5–10°, and their loose [[tephra]] are material for dangerous [[lahar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=eJopFDVRgYMC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq |title=Volcanoes: Global Perspectives |first=John P. |last=Lockwood |first2=Richard W. |last2=Hazlett |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6250-0 |page=552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pieces of tephra are called [[volcanic bomb]]s. Big bombs can measure more than 4 feet(1.2 meters) across and weigh several tons.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Melvin, Gilda Berger, and Higgins Bond. "Volcanoes-why and how ." Why do volcanoes blow their tops?: Questions and answers about volcanoes and earthquakes. New York: Scholastic, 1999. 7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supervolcanoes===
{{Main|Supervolcano}}
{{see also|List of largest volcanic eruptions}}
A '''supervolcano''' usually has a large [[caldera]] and can produce devastation on an enormous, sometimes continental, scale. Such volcanoes are able to severely cool global temperatures for many years after the eruption due to the huge volumes of [[sulfur]] and ash released into the atmosphere. They are the most dangerous type of volcano. Examples include [[Yellowstone Caldera]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]] and [[Valles Caldera]] in [[New Mexico]] (both western United States); [[Lake Taupo]] in New Zealand; [[Lake Toba]] in [[Sumatra]], Indonesia; and [[Ngorongoro Crater]] in Tanzania. Because of the enormous area they may cover, supervolcanoes are hard to identify centuries after an eruption. Similarly, [[large igneous province]]s are also considered supervolcanoes because of the vast amount of [[basalt]] lava erupted (even though the lava flow is [[effusive eruption|non-explosive]]).

===Underwater volcanoes===
{{Main|Submarine volcano}}
{{See also|Subaqueous volcano}}
'''Submarine volcanoes''' are common features of the ocean floor. In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean's surface. In the ocean's deep, the tremendous weight of the water above prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, they can be detected by [[hydrophone]]s and discoloration of water because of [[volcanic gas]]es. [[Pillow lava]] is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy of water (as compared to air) which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. [[Hydrothermal vent]]s are common near these volcanoes, and [[Black smoker|some support peculiar ecosystems]] based on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating [[pumice raft]]s.

===Subglacial volcanoes===
{{Main|Subglacial volcano}}
'''Subglacial volcanoes''' develop underneath [[ice cap|icecaps]]. They are made up of flat lava which flows at the top of extensive pillow lavas and [[palagonite]]. When the icecap melts, the lava on top collapses, leaving a flat-topped mountain. These volcanoes are also called [[tuya|table mountains]], [[tuya]]s, or (uncommonly) mobergs. Very good examples of this type of volcano can be seen in Iceland, however, there are also tuyas in [[British Columbia]]. The origin of the term comes from [[Tuya Butte]], which is one of the several tuyas in the area of the [[Tuya River]] and [[Tuya Range]] in northern British Columbia. Tuya Butte was the first such [[landform]] analyzed and so its name has entered the geological literature for this kind of volcanic formation. The [[Tuya Mountains Provincial Park]] was recently established to protect this unusual landscape, which lies north of [[Tuya Lake]] and south of the [[Jennings River]] near the boundary with the [[Yukon Territory]].

===Mud volcanoes===
{{Main|Mud volcano}}
'''Mud volcanoes''' or '''mud domes''' are formations created by geo-excreted liquids and gases, although there are several processes which may cause such activity. The largest structures are 10 kilometers in diameter and reach 700 meters high.

==Erupted material==

[[File:DenglerSW-Stromboli-20040928-1230x800.jpg|thumb|The [[Stromboli]] stratovolcano off the coast of [[Sicily]] has erupted continuously for thousands of years, giving rise to the term [[strombolian eruption]].]]

===Lava composition===
Another way of classifying volcanoes is by the ''composition of material erupted'' (lava), since this affects the shape of the volcano. Lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casq|first1=R.A.F.|last2=Wright|first2=J.V.|title=Volcanic Successions|date=1987|publisher=Unwin Hyman Inc|isbn=978-0-04-552022-0|page=528}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the erupted [[magma]] contains a high percentage (&gt;63%) of [[silica]], the lava is called [[felsic]].
**Felsic lavas ([[dacite]]s or [[rhyolite]]s) tend to be highly [[viscous]] (not very fluid) and are erupted as domes or short, stubby flows. Viscous lavas tend to form [[stratovolcano]]es or lava domes. [[Lassen Peak]] in California is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome.
**Because siliceous magmas are so viscous, they tend to trap [[Volatiles#Igneous petrology|volatiles]] (gases) that are present, which cause the magma to erupt catastrophically, eventually forming stratovolcanoes. [[Pyroclastic flow]]s ([[ignimbrite]]s) are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes, since they are composed of molten volcanic ash too heavy to go up into the atmosphere, so they hug the volcano's slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions. Temperatures as high as 1,200&amp;nbsp;°C are known to occur in pyroclastic flows, which will incinerate everything flammable in their path and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down, often up to many meters thick. [[Alaska]]'s [[Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes]], formed by the eruption of [[Novarupta]] near [[Mount Katmai|Katmai]] in 1912, is an example of a thick pyroclastic flow or ignimbrite deposit. Volcanic ash that is light enough to be erupted high into the [[Earth's atmosphere]] may travel many kilometres before it falls back to ground as a [[tuff]].
*If the erupted magma contains 52–63% silica, the lava is of ''intermediate'' composition.
**These "[[Andesite|andesitic]]" volcanoes generally only occur above [[subduction zone]]s (e.g. [[Mount Merapi]] in Indonesia).
**Andesitic lava is typically formed at [[convergent boundary]] margins of [[tectonic plate]]s, by several processes:
***Hydration melting of peridotite and fractional crystallization[[File:Sarychev Peak eruption on 12 June 2009, oblique satellite view.ogv|thumb|right|[[Sarychev Peak]] eruption, [[Matua Island]], oblique satellite view]]
***Melting of subducted [[Slab (geology)|slab]] containing sediments{{citation needed|reason=I believe that full-slab melting has been rejected, and it is more mineral destabiliztion; tag here to incite me or someone else to find a ref. Same comment left at [[Andesite]]. |date=April 2011}}
***Magma mixing between felsic rhyolitic and mafic basaltic magmas in an intermediate reservoir prior to emplacement or lava flow.
*If the erupted magma contains &lt;52% and &gt;45% silica, the lava is called [[mafic]] (because it contains higher percentages of [[magnesium]] (Mg) and iron (Fe)) or [[basalt]]ic. These lavas are usually much less viscous than rhyolitic lavas, depending on their eruption temperature; they also tend to be hotter than felsic lavas. Mafic lavas occur in a wide range of settings:
**At [[mid-ocean ridge]]s, where two oceanic plates are pulling apart, basaltic lava erupts as [[Lava#Pillow lava|pillows]] to fill the gap;
**[[Shield volcanoes]] (e.g. the [[Hawaiian Islands]], including [[Mauna Loa]] and [[Kilauea]]), on both [[oceanic crust|oceanic]] and [[continental crust]];
**As continental [[flood basalt]]s.
*Some erupted magmas contain &lt;=45% silica and produce [[ultramafic]] lava. Ultramafic flows, also known as [[komatiite]]s, are very rare; indeed, very few have been erupted at the Earth's surface since the [[Proterozoic]], when the planet's heat flow was higher. They are (or were) the hottest lavas, and probably more fluid than common mafic lavas.

===Lava texture===
Two types of lava are named according to the surface texture: {{okina}}A{{okina}}a (pronounced {{IPA-haw|ˈʔaʔa|}}) and [[pāhoehoe]] ({{IPA-haw|paːˈho.eˈho.e|}}), both [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] words. {{okina}}A{{okina}}a is characterized by a rough, clinkery surface and is the typical texture of viscous lava flows. However, even basaltic or mafic flows can be erupted as {{okina}}a{{okina}}a flows, particularly if the eruption rate is high and the slope is steep.

Pāhoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows. Usually, only mafic flows will erupt as pāhoehoe, since they often erupt at higher temperatures or have the proper chemical make-up to allow them to flow with greater fluidity.

==Volcanic activity== &lt;!-- [[Dormant volcano]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Pompeii - Casa del Centenario - MAN.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Fresco]] with [[Mount Vesuvius]] behind [[Bacchus]] and [[Agathodaemon]], as seen in [[Pompeii]]'s [[House of the Centenary]]]]

===Popular classification of volcanoes===
A popular way of classifying magmatic volcanoes is by their frequency of [[Types of volcanic eruptions|eruption]]{{according to whom|date=October 2016}}, with those that erupt regularly called '''active''', those that have erupted in historical times but are now quiet called '''dormant''' or '''inactive''', and those that have not erupted in historical times called '''extinct'''. However, these popular classifications—extinct in particular—are practically meaningless to scientists. They use classifications which refer to a particular volcano's formative and eruptive processes and resulting shapes.

====Active====
{{See also|Category:Active volcanoes|Category:Potentially active volcanoes|List of currently erupting volcanoes}}
There is no consensus among volcanologists on how to define an "active" volcano. The lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years, making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations. For example, many of Earth's volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption. Given the long lifespan of such volcanoes, they are very active. By human lifespans, however, they are not.

Scientists usually consider a volcano to be ''erupting'' or ''likely to erupt'' if it is currently erupting, or showing signs of unrest such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions. Most scientists consider a volcano ''active'' if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years ([[Holocene]] times) – the Smithsonian [[Global Volcanism Program]] uses this definition of ''active''.

====Extinct====
{{Redirect|Extinct volcano|the category of extinct volcanoes|Category:Extinct volcanoes}}
[[File:Fourpeaked-fumaroles-cyrus-read1.JPG|thumb|[[Fourpeaked Mountain|Fourpeaked volcano]], [[Alaska]], in September 2006 after being thought extinct for over 10,000 years]]
[[File:Rinjani 1994.jpg|thumb|Mount [[Rinjani]] eruption in 1994, in [[Lombok]], [[Indonesia]]]]
Extinct volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt again because the volcano no longer has a magma supply. Examples of extinct volcanoes are many volcanoes on the [[Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain]] in the Pacific Ocean (although some volcanoes at the eastern end of the chain are active), [[Hohentwiel]] in Germany, [[Shiprock]] in New Mexico, and [[Zuidwal volcano]] in the [[Netherlands]]. [[Edinburgh Castle]] in Scotland is famously located atop an extinct volcano. Otherwise, whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine. Since "supervolcano" [[caldera]]s can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years, a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years is likely to be considered dormant instead of extinct. Some volcanologists refer to extinct volcanoes as inactive, though the term is now more commonly used for dormant volcanoes once thought to be extinct.

====Dormant and reactivated  {{anchor|Dormant}}====
{{See also|Category:Dormant volcanoes|Category:Inactive volcanoes}}
[[File:Narcondam island.jpg|thumb|[[Narcondam Island]], India, is classified as a dormant volcano by the [[Geological Survey of India]]]]
It is difficult to distinguish an extinct volcano from a dormant (inactive) one. Dormant volcanoes are those that have not erupted for thousands of years, but are likely to erupt again in the future.&lt;ref name="Nelson2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/Natural_Disasters/volhaz&amp;pred.htm | title=Volcanic Hazards &amp; Prediction of Volcanic Eruptions | publisher=Tulane University | date=4 October 2016 | accessdate=5 September 2018 | author=Nelson, Stephen A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VolcWorldDormant"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/how-volcano-defined-being-active-dormant-or-extinct | title=How is a volcano defined as being active, dormant, or extinct? | publisher=Oregon State University | work=Volcano World | accessdate=5 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanoes are often considered to be extinct if there are no written records of its activity. Nevertheless, volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time. For example,  [[Yellowstone Caldera|Yellowstone]] has a repose/recharge period of around 700,000 years, and [[Toba Lake|Toba]] of around 380,000 years.&lt;ref name=chesner1991&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1991)019&lt;0200:EHOESL&gt;2.3.CO;2|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/~raman/papers/ChesnerGeology.pdf|last1=Chesner| first1=C.A.|last2=Rose|first2=J.A.|last3=Deino|first3=W.I.|last4=Drake|first4=R.|last5=Westgate|first5=A.|title=Eruptive History of Earth's Largest Quaternary caldera (Toba, Indonesia) Clarified|volume=19|pages=200–203|journal=Geology|date=March 1991|accessdate=January 20, 2010|issue=3|bibcode = 1991Geo....19..200C }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vesuvius]] was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of 79 CE]], which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Before its catastrophic eruption of 1991, [[Pinatubo]] was an inconspicuous volcano, unknown to most people in the surrounding areas. Two other examples are the long-dormant [[Soufrière Hills]] volcano on the island of [[Montserrat]], thought to be extinct before activity resumed in 1995, and [[Fourpeaked Mountain]] in [[Alaska]], which, before its September 2006 eruption, had not erupted since before 8000 BCE and had long been thought to be extinct.

===Technical classification of volcanoes===

====Volcanic-alert level====
The three common popular classifications of volcanoes can be subjective and some volcanoes thought to have been extinct have erupted again. To help prevent people from falsely believing they are not at risk when living on or near a volcano, countries have adopted new classifications to describe the various levels and stages of volcanic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volcanolive.com/alerts.html |title=Volcanic Alert Levels of Various Countries |publisher=Volcanolive.com |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some alert systems use different numbers or colors to designate the different stages.  Other systems use colors and words.  Some systems use a combination of both.

====Volcano warning schemes of the United States====
{{Main|Volcano warning schemes of the United States}}
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted a common system nationwide for characterizing the level of unrest and eruptive activity at volcanoes. The new volcano alert-level system classifies volcanoes now as being in a normal, advisory, watch or warning stage.  Additionally, colors are used to denote the amount of ash produced.

==Decade volcanoes==

The [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]], an initiative of the [[Deep Carbon Observatory]], monitors nine volcanoes, two of which are Decade volcanoes. The focus of the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project is to use [[Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System]] instruments to measure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ratios in real-time and in high-resolution to allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving [[prediction of volcanic activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aiuppa|first1=Alessandro|last2=Moretti|first2=Roberto|last3=Federico|first3=Cinzia|last4=Giudice|first4=Gaetano|last5=Gurrieri|first5=Sergio|last6=Liuzzo|first6=Marco|last7=Papale|first7=Paolo|last8=Shinohara|first8=Hiroshi|last9=Valenza|first9=Mariano|title=Forecasting Etna eruptions by real-time observation of volcanic gas composition|journal=Geology|date=2007|volume=35|issue=12|pages=1115–1118|doi=10.1130/G24149A.1|bibcode=2007Geo....35.1115A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of volcanoes==

[[File:Mauna Loa atmospheric transmission.png|thumb|Solar radiation graph 1958–2008, showing how the radiation is reduced after major volcanic eruptions]]
[[File:SO2 Galapagos 20051101.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sulfur dioxide]] concentration over the [[Sierra Negra (Galápagos)|Sierra Negra Volcano]], [[Galapagos Islands]], during an eruption in October 2005]]

There are many different [[types of volcanic eruptions]] and associated activity: [[phreatic eruptions]] (steam-generated eruptions), explosive eruption of high-[[silica]] lava (e.g., [[rhyolite]]), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., [[basalt]]), [[pyroclastic flow]]s, [[lahar]]s (debris flow) and [[carbon dioxide]] emission. All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. Earthquakes, [[hot spring]]s, [[fumarole]]s, [[mud pot]]s and [[geyser]]s often accompany volcanic activity.

=== Volcanic gases ===

The concentrations of different [[volcanic gas]]es can vary considerably from one volcano to the next. [[Water vapor]] is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by [[carbon dioxide]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last1 = Pedone  | first1 = M. | last2 = Aiuppa | first2 = A.| last3 = Giudice | first3 = G. | last4 = Grassa | first4 = F.| last5 = Francofonte | first5 = V. | last6 = Bergsson | first6 = B.| last7 = Ilyinskaya | first7 = E.| title = Tunable diode laser measurements of hydrothermal/volcanic CO2 and implications for the global CO2 budget| journal = Solid Earth | date = 2014| volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 1209–1221| doi = 10.5194/se-5-1209-2014| url = http://www.solid-earth.net/5/1209/2014/se-5-1209-2014.pdf
| bibcode = 2014SolE....5.1209P }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sulfur dioxide]]. Other principal volcanic gases include [[hydrogen sulfide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], and [[hydrogen fluoride]]. A large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions, for example [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[halocarbon]]s, organic compounds, and volatile metal chlorides.

Large, explosive volcanic eruptions inject water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen chloride (HCl), hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ash (pulverized rock and [[pumice]]) into the [[stratosphere]] to heights of 16–32 kilometres (10–20&amp;nbsp;mi) above the Earth's surface. The most significant impacts from these injections come from the conversion of sulfur dioxide to [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which condenses rapidly in the stratosphere to form fine [[sulfate]] [[aerosols]]. The SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions alone of two different eruptions are sufficient to compare their potential climatic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; The aerosols increase the Earth's [[albedo]]—its reflection of radiation from the [[Sun]] back into space—and thus cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the [[stratosphere]]. Several eruptions during the past century have caused a decline in the average temperature at the Earth's surface of up to half a degree (Fahrenheit scale) for periods of one to three years; sulfur dioxide from the eruption of [[Huaynaputina]] probably caused the [[Russian famine of 1601–1603]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=University of California – Davis  |title=Volcanic Eruption Of 1600 Caused Global Disruption |date=April 25, 2008 |work=ScienceDaily |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080423135236.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Significant consequences ===

==== Prehistory ====

A [[volcanic winter]] is thought to have taken place around 70,000 years ago after the [[supervolcano|supereruption]] of [[Lake Toba]] on Sumatra island in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supervolcano eruption — in Sumatra — deforested India 73,000 years ago|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091123142739.htm|website=ScienceDaily|date=November 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]] to which some anthropologists and archeologists subscribe, it had global consequences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The new batch - 150,000 years ago|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/human/human_evolution/new_batch1.shtml|publisher=BBC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326004611/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/prehistoric_life/human/human_evolution/new_batch1.shtml|archivedate=2006-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; killing most humans then alive and creating a [[population bottleneck]] that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2975862.stm|title=When humans faced extinction|publisher=BBC|date=June 9, 2003|accessdate=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that volcanic activity caused or contributed to the [[Ordovician-Silurian extinction events|End-Ordovician]], [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic]], [[Late Devonian extinction|Late Devonian]] [[mass extinction]]s, and possibly others. The massive eruptive event which formed the [[Siberian Traps]], one of the largest known volcanic events of the last 500&amp;nbsp;million years of [[Earth's geological history]], continued for a million years and is considered to be the likely cause of the "[[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Great Dying]]" about 250 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Hanlon|first1=Larry|title=Yellowstone's Super Sister|url=http://www.discovery.com/convergence/supervolcano/others/others_07.html|website=Discovery Channel|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314025022/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/supervolcano/others/others_07.html|archivedate=2005-03-14|date=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is estimated to have killed 90% of species existing at the time.&lt;ref&gt;

==== Historical ====

The 1815 eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] created global climate anomalies that became known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]" because of the effect on North American and European weather.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ipNcKc0Mv5IC&amp;pg=PA155 Volcanoes in human history: the far-reaching effects of major eruptions]''.

[[Princeton University Press]]. p. 155. {{ISBN|0-691-05081-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural crops failed and livestock died in much of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in one of the worst famines of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oppenheimer |first=Clive |title=Climatic, environmental and human consequences of the largest known historic eruption: Tambora volcano (Indonesia) 1815 |journal=Progress in Physical Geography |volume=27|issue=2|year=2003|pages=230–259|doi=10.1191/0309133303pp379ra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The freezing winter of 1740–41, which led to widespread [[Irish Famine (1740–1741)|famine]] in northern Europe, may also owe its origins to a volcanic eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ó Gráda|first1=Cormac|title=Famine: A Short History|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8857.html|publisher=Princeton University Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112061115/http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8857.html|archivedate=2016-01-12|date=February 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acid rain ===

[[File:Eyjafjallajokull-April-17.JPG|thumb|right|Ash plume rising from [[Eyjafjallajökull]] on April 17, 2010]]
Sulfate aerosols promote complex [[chemical reaction]]s on their surfaces that alter chlorine and [[nitrogen]] chemical species in the stratosphere. This effect, together with increased stratospheric [[chlorine]] levels from [[Haloalkane|chlorofluorocarbon]] pollution, generates chlorine monoxide (ClO), which destroys [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). As the aerosols grow and coagulate, they settle down into the upper troposphere where they serve as nuclei for [[cirrus cloud]]s and further modify the Earth's [[radiation]] balance. Most of the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) are dissolved in water droplets in the [[eruption cloud]] and quickly fall to the ground as [[acid rain]]. The injected ash also falls rapidly from the stratosphere; most of it is removed within several days to a few weeks. Finally, explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of [[carbon]] for biogeochemical cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/of97-262/of97-262.html|title=Impacts of Volcanic Gases on Climate, the Environment, and People|first1=Kenneth A. |last1=McGee |first2=Michael P. |last2=Doukas |first3=Richard |last3=Kessler |first4=Terrence M. |last4=Gerlach|date=May 1997|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=9 August 2014}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas emissions from volcanoes are a natural contributor to acid rain. Volcanic activity releases about 130 to 230 [[Yottagram|teragrams]] (145 million to 255 million [[short ton]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/VolGas/volgas.html|title=Volcanic Gases and Their Effects|accessdate=June 16, 2007|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic eruptions may inject aerosols into the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Large injections may cause visual effects such as unusually colorful sunsets and affect global [[climate]] mainly by cooling it. Volcanic eruptions also provide the benefit of adding nutrients to [[soil]] through the [[weathering]] process of volcanic rocks. These fertile soils assist the growth of plants and various crops. Volcanic eruptions can also create new islands, as the magma cools and solidifies upon contact with the water.

=== Hazards ===
{{Main|Volcanic hazards}}
Ash thrown into the air by eruptions can present a hazard to aircraft, especially [[jet aircraft]] where the particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the [[turbine]] blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine.  Dangerous encounters in 1982 after the eruption of [[Galunggung]] in Indonesia, and 1989 after the eruption of [[Mount Redoubt]] in Alaska raised awareness of this phenomenon.  Nine [[Volcanic Ash Advisory Center]]s were established by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] to monitor ash clouds and advise pilots accordingly.  The [[2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull]] caused major disruptions to air travel in Europe.

The Earth's [[Moon]] has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity, although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wieczorek|first1=Mark A.|last2=Jolliff|first2=Bradley L.|last3=Khan|first3=Amir|last4=Pritchard|first4=Matthew E.|last5=Weiss|first5=Benjamin P.|last6=Williams|first6=James G.|last7=Hood|first7=Lon L.|last8=Righter|first8=Kevin|last9=Neal|first9=Clive R.|last10=Shearer|first10=Charles K.|last11=McCallum|first11=I.

The planet [[Venus]] has a surface that is 90% [[basalt]], indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bindschadler|first1=D. L.|title=Magellan: A new view of Venus' geology and geophysics|journal=Reviews of Geophysics|date=1995|volume=33|pages=459|doi=10.1029/95RG00281|bibcode=1995RvGeS..33..459B}}&lt;/ref&gt; from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano [[Maat Mons]], in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.

These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years,&lt;ref name="ESAmarsvolcanoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMLF6D3M5E_0.html|title=Glacial, volcanic and fluvial activity on Mars: latest images |publisher=[[European Space Agency]]|accessdate=August 17, 2006|date=February 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the European ''[[Mars Express]]'' spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well.&lt;ref name="ESAmarsvolcanoes"/&gt;

[[Jupiter]]'s [[Natural satellite|moon]] [[Io (moon)|Io]] is the most volcanically active object in the solar system because of [[tides|tidal]] interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt [[sulfur]], [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[silicate]] rock, and as a result, [[Io (moon)|Io]] is constantly being resurfaced. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the solar system, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500&amp;nbsp;°C). In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the solar system occurred on Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exceptionally bright eruption on Io rivals largest in solar system|url=http://keckobservatory.org/recent/entry/exceptionally_bright_eruption_on_io_rivals_largest_in_solar_syatem/|website=W. M. Keck Observatory|date=November 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], the smallest of Jupiter's [[Galilean moon]]s, also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as [[cryovolcanism]], and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the [[solar system]].

In 1989 the [[Voyager 2]] spacecraft observed [[cryovolcano]]es (ice volcanoes) on [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], a [[Natural satellite|moon]] of [[Neptune]], and in 2005 the [[Cassini–Huygens]] probe photographed [[Enceladus (moon)#Cryovolcanism|fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus]], a moon of [[Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/enceladus.asp|title=Cassini Finds an Atmosphere on Saturn's Moon Enceladus|date=16 March 2005|work=[[PPARC]]|accessdate=4 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310211512/http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/enceladus.asp|archivedate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- replaced it above&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pparc.ac.uk/Nw/enceladus.asp |title=Cassini Finds an Atmosphere on Saturn's Moon Enceladus' |publisher=Pparc.ac.uk |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2198.html|title=Enceladus, Saturn's Moon|last=Smith|first=Yvette|date=March 15, 2012|work=Image of the Day Gallery|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ejecta may be composed of water, [[liquid nitrogen]], [[ammonia]], dust, or [[methane]] compounds. Cassini–Huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the [[Saturn]]ian moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7489 |title=Hydrocarbon volcano discovered on Titan|date=June 8, 2005 |publisher=Newscientist.com |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the [[Kuiper Belt Object]] [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]].

A 2010 study of the [[exoplanet]] [[COROT-7b]], which was detected by [[transit method|transit]] in 2009, suggested that [[tidal heating]] from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jaggard|first=Victoria|title="Super Earth" May Really Be New Planet Type: Super-Io|work=National Geographic web site daily news|publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]|date=February 5, 2010|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/02/100205-new-type-planet-corot-7b-io/|accessdate=March 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional beliefs about volcanoes==
{{Expand section|date=October 2016}}
{{See also|Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl}}
Many ancient accounts ascribe volcanic eruptions to [[supernatural]] causes, such as the actions of [[deity|god]]s or [[demigod]]s. To the ancient Greeks, volcanoes' capricious power could only be explained as acts of the gods, while 16th/17th-century German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] believed they were ducts for the Earth's tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | first = Micheal
 | last = Williams
 | date = November 2007
 | title = Hearts of fire
 | journal = Morning Calm
 | issue = 11–2007
 | page = 6
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;  One early idea counter to this was proposed by [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Athanasius Kircher]] (1602–1680), who witnessed eruptions of [[Mount Etna]] and [[Stromboli]], then visited the crater of [[Vesuvius]] and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of [[sulfur]], [[bitumen]] and [[coal]].

Various explanations were proposed for volcano behavior before the modern understanding of the Earth's [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] structure as a semisolid material was developed. For decades after awareness that compression and [[radioactive]] materials may be heat sources, their contributions were specifically discounted. Volcanic action was often attributed to [[chemical]] reactions and a thin layer of molten rock near the surface.

The '''West African Power Pool''' ('''WAPP''') is a cooperation of the national electricity companies in Western Africa under the auspecies of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS). The members of WAPP are working for establishing a reliable power grid for the region and a common market for electricity. It was founded in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''West Rapti''' drains [[Rapti Zone]] in [[Mid-Western Region, Nepal]], then [[Awadh]] and [[Purvanchal]] regions of [[Uttar Pradesh]] state, [[India]] before joining the [[Ghaghara]] -- a major left bank tributary of the [[Ganges]] known as the Karnali inside Nepal.

The West Rapti is notable for [[Adivasi|''janajati'']] ethnic groups – [[Kham Magar]] among its highland sources and then [[Tharu people|Tharu]] in [[Inner Terai]] Deukhuri Valley, for its irrigation and hydroelectric potential, and for recurrent floods that led to its nickname "Gorakhpur's Sorrow".

==Geography==
The Rapti rises south of a prominent E-W ridgeline midway between the western [[Dhaulagiri]] Himalaya and the [[Mahabharat Range]].  A {{convert|3500|m}} summit on this ridgeline marks a triple [[Drainage divide|divide]].  North of the triple divide the [[Karnali River|Karnali]] and [[Gandaki River|Gandaki]] basins are adjacent; south of it the Rapti and similar but smaller ''[[Babai River]]'' ({{lang-ne|बबई नदी}}; {{lang|ne-Latn|Babaī Nadī}}) separate the two larger basins. After crossing into India, the Babai and Rapti separately join the Karnali's continuation called ''Ghaghara''.  The Ghaghara ultimately joins the Ganges.

==Sources and course==
The Rapti's headwaters descend south from rugged highlands populated by [[Kham Magar]].  The western tributary ''Mādī Kholā''  ({{lang-ne|माडी खोला}}) rises in northwestern [[Rolpa District|Rolpa]] and is joined by ''Lungrī Kholā'' ({{lang-ne|लुङग्री खोला}}) draining northeastern Rolpa.  The Mardi then crosses into [[Pyuthan District|Pyuthan]].  It is joined by east-flowing Arun Kholā ({{lang-ne|अरुण खोला}}) at Devithān ({{lang-ne|देवीथान}}) where it enters a gorge through the [[Mahabharat Range]].

''Jhimruk Kholā''  ({{lang-ne|झिमरुक खोला}}) -- east of the Mardi—mainly drains [[Pyuthan District|Pyuthan]].  Below the upper highlands, an alluvial valley opens where [[Bahun]] and [[Chhetri]] rice farmers irrigate [[paddy fields]].  At ''Cherneta'', Pyuthan the Jhimruk approaches within 1.5&amp;nbsp;km of the Mardi and a 12 megawatt [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant exploits the Jhimruk being 200 meters higher.

Below Cherneta the Jhimruk loops east, becoming the border between Pyuthan and [[Arghakhanchi District]].  Its valley narrows and steepens as it enters the Mahabharat Range.  Partway through it joins the Mardi and the combined flow is then named the Rapti.  The main river emerges from its gorge into the lower [[Siwalik Hills]] and [[Dang District, Nepal|Dang District]].  At [[Bhalubang|Bhalubang Bazaar]] Nepal's east-west [[Mahendra Highway]] bridges the river.

Below Bhalubang, [[Inner Terai]] ''Deukhuri Valley'' opens between the ''Dang'' and ''[[Dudhwa Range]]s'', both subranges of the Siwaliks. Valley, following the WNW trend of the Siwalik hills for 100&amp;nbsp;km.  Although the land is fertile, before [[DDT#Use against malaria|DDT]] came into use in the 1950s Deukhuri was so [[malaria]]l  that only the [[Tharu people]] who had genetic resistance could be confident of surviving the warmer months.

The river crosses from Dang into [[Banke District]].  Approaching  [[Nepalganj]]—largest town in Nepal's western [[Terai]]—the Dudhwa Hills fall away and the river turns SE, crossing into Uttar Pradesh, India and flowing through districts [[Shravasti district|Shravasti]], [[Siddharthnagar district|Siddharth Nagar]], [[Basti district|Basti]], [[Sant Kabir Nagar district|Sant Kabir Nagar]] and [[Gorakhpur district|Gorakhpur]], passing [[Gorakhpur]] city at about 135 air miles (215&amp;nbsp;km) from Nepal.

Just west of the city it is joined by the smaller [[Rohni River|Rohini]] rising further east in Nepal's [[Nawalparasi District|Nawalparasi]] and [[Rupandehi District]]s, draining 794&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Nepal then 1892&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in India.  60&amp;nbsp;km beyond Gorakhpur the Rapti joins the Ghaghara (Karnali) at Rajpur.  About 120&amp;nbsp;km further on at [[Chhapra]], the Ghaghara reaches the Ganges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.india9.com/i9show/Rapti-River-40183.htm   | title = Rapti River   | work =    | first=  | lāast=  | publisher =india9  |accessdate = 2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://basti.nic.in/basti_nic2/knowchd_general.htm | title =Basti  | work =    | first=  | last=  | publisher = Basti district administration |accessdate = 2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sknagar.nic.in/profile.htm| title =Sant Kabir Nagar district | work =    | first=  | last=  | publisher = Sant Kabir Nagar district administration |accessdate = 2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient city of [[Sravasti]], once capital of [[Kosala Kingdom]], stood on the western bank of the Achirvati. The river was a tributary of the [[Sarayu]].

==History==
{{see also|House of Tulsipur}}


==Development==
The Rapti's flow has great seasonal variation because the river lacks sources in high elevation glaciers and snowfields to buffer pre-monsoon drought.  Average monthly flows at ''[[Jalaun district|Jalkundi]]'' (27°58'N, 82°14'E) in Deukhuri Valley vary from 17.6&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s in pre-monsoon April to 451&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s at the peak of the monsoon in August.  Maximum recorded flood was 7,390&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s on 10 September 1981. [[100-year flood]] flows are predicted at 10,100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s. Over {{convert|700000|acres}} in Uttar Pradesh are at risk of floods every year.

Flood control projects under study include a dam at Jalkundi that would inundate {{convert|71000|acres}} of farmland in Deukhuri Valley. An alternative dam site is upstream at ''Naumure'' on the Pyuthan-Dang district border (27°53'N, 82°48'E). This would be an earthen dam 169&amp;nbsp;m high with 351 million cubic meters live storage capacity, storing excess monsoon flows for irrigation use during the following dry season and generating up to 207 megawatts.  Impoundment would mainly be in gorges through the Mahabharat Range, inundating less farmland than the Jalkundi alternative. Plans are also underway for three irrigation sub-projects – [[Kapilvastu District]] {{convert|30500|ha}} involving interbasin water transfer to the southeast, Deukhuri Valley {{convert|9500|ha}}, and [[Banke District]] {{convert|40000|ha}}.&lt;ref name="disputes"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cgYwDW13ILoC&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=Rapti+river&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bRsSlrtEhG&amp;sig=gPSsuY0WUWH4L3vkdc9puJKGJeg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aWL_S_LjIpK3rAfI0sWEDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&amp;q=Rapti%20river&amp;f=false   | title =  The Nepal-India Water Relationship: Challenges

The '''Winkler Index''', sometimes known as the '''Winkler Scale''' or '''Winkler''' '''Regions''', is a technique for classifying the [[climate]] of [[wine]] [[growing region]]s based on heat summation or [[growing degree-day]]s. In the system, geographical areas are divided into five climate regions based on temperature converted to [[growing degree-day]]s, and is commonly known as '''Regions I–V''' (see below).  The system was developed at the [[University of California, Davis]] by [[A. J. Winkler]] and [[Maynard Amerine]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Amerine|first=M.A.|last2=Winkler|first2=A.J.|year=1944|title=Composition and quality of musts and wines of California grapes|url=|journal=Hilgardia|volume=15|pages=493–675|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=General viticulture|last=Winkler|first=A.J., et al|publisher=University of California Press|year=1974|isbn=0520025911|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The system==
The system is based on both the hypothesis and observations that [[Grapes|grapevines]] do not grow if the temperature is below 50&amp;nbsp;°F (10&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each day during the growing season (assumed under the system to be April 1 through October 31 in the Northern Hemisphere; October 1 through April 30 in the Southern Hemisphere) are assigned [[growing degree-day]]s according to the amount that the day's average temperature exceeds this threshold; one degree day per degree [[Fahrenheit]] over 50&amp;nbsp;°F (or with [[SI]] units, degrees [[Celsius]] over 10&amp;nbsp;°C is used). All days during the growing season are then added up (all negative values are set to zero), with the sum of the growing degree-days used to determine the region's classification in the original '''Winkler index''' as follows:

The system was originally developed for and is used officially in [[Californian wine|California]] and was based on the general ripening capabilities and wine styles&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; that can be achieved in the climate due to heat accumulation (growing degree-days). The general ripening capabilities include hybrid grape varieties through early season, mid-season, and late season ripening ''V. Vinifera'' and even [[table grape]]s in the warmest areas of Region V. The general wine styles include lighter, more subtle wines with lower alcohol and brighter fruit aromas and flavors (including [[Champagne]] and other sparkling wines) found in cooler climates (Regions Ia, Ib, II and lower III) to bolder, bigger wines often with higher alcohol and lush, darker fruit aromas and flavors that are found in warmer climates (Region III, IV and V). Region V was stated as also having a tendency to be more suitable to higher production wines, [[Sherry]] and other [[fortified wine]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One issue with the original work done by Amerine and Winkler&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was that it did not specify a lower class limit for Region I (originally 2500 or less) or an upper class limit for Region V (originally 4000 or greater). Subsequent research&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=G.V., et al.|year=2010|title=Spatial analysis of climate in winegrape growing regions in the western United States|url=|journal=American Journal of Enology and Viticulture|volume=61 |issue=3|pages=313–326|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=A.|last2=Jones|first2=G.V.|date=|year=2010|title=Spatial analysis of climate in winegrape-growing regions in Australia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-0238.2010.00100.x/abstract|journal=Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=389–404|doi=10.1111/j.1755-0238.2010.00100.x|issn=1755-0238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; using high resolution spatial climate data identified these limits for California, Oregon, Washington and Idaho, along with Australia. The results provided a lower bound to Region I of 1500 F° units (850 C° units) and an upper bound to Region V of 4900 F° units (2700 C° units). Furthermore, additional research in other wine regions found that Region I was best divided into a Region Ia (very early ripening varieties, mostly hybrid grapes) and Region Ib (early ripening varieties, mostly [[Vitis vinifera|''V. Vinifera'']]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=J.D.|last2=Jones|first2=G.V.|last3=Tait|first3=A.|last4=Hall|first4=A.|last5=Trought|first5=M.C.T.|date=|year=2012|title=Analysis of viticulture region climate structure and suitability in New Zealand|url=http://oeno-one.eu/article/view/1515|journal=OENO One|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=149–165|doi=10.20870/oeno-one.2012.46.3.1515|issn=2494-1271|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/771916683|title=Climate, Grapes, and Wine: Structure and Suitability in a Variable and Changing Climate, in The geography of wine : regions, terroir and techniques|last=Jones|first=G.V., et al.|publisher=Springer Press|year=2012|isbn=9789400704640|location=Netherlands|pages=109–133|oclc=771916683|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Winkler Index''' is also widely used in many other growing regions in the [[United States wine|United States]], such as [[Oregon wine|Oregon]] and [[Washington wine|Washington]], along with [[Canadian wine|Canada]], South America, [[Australian wine|Australia]], [[New Zealand wine|New Zealand]], [[South African wine|South Africa]], and Europe. However, it is less widely used in Europe where the [[Huglin index]]&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huglin|first=P.|year=1978|title=Nouveau Mode d’Évaluation des Possibilités Héliothermiques d’un Milieu Viticole|url=|journal=C.R. Acad. Agr. France|volume=64|pages=1117–1126|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is favored. The Huglin index uses a similar formula but gives more weight to maximum temperatures and uses an adjustment for longer day lengths found at higher latitudes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It is also functionally similar to growing season average temperatures (simple average of temperatures across the seven month [[Annual growth cycle of grapevines|growing season]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Application==
The table below provides examples of the ripening and wine style concept used in the application of the '''Winkler Index''' for numerous wine regions globally. Region Ia are the coolest areas with known regions including [[Champagne]], [[Central Otago wine region|Central Otago]], and [[Valais]]. Region Ia also includes numerous newer regions growing grapes and making wine including [[southern England]], areas in northern [[Europe]], [[Nova Scotia wine|Nova Scotia]], and southern areas of [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]. Region Ia areas ripen a range of [[hybrid grape]]s and some very early ripening ''[[Vitis vinifera|V. Vinifera]].'' Region Ib is slightly warmer, can ripen early varieties such as [[Chardonnay]], [[Pinot noir]], [[Sauvignon blanc]] or [[Riesling]] with characteristic locations within the [[Rhine]] and [[Mosel (wine region)|Mosel]] valleys, [[Burgundy]] and the [[Loire Valley]], or the [[Willamette Valley AVA|Willamette Valley]] in [[Oregon]] as good examples. Region II includes cooler locations within areas such as [[Bordeaux]], [[Coonawarra wine region|Coonawarra]], and Valle de Curicó in [[Chile]]. Warmer areas in these wine regions fall in a Winkler Region III as do much of the [[Rhône wine|Northern Rhône]], [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]], [[Umbria]], and the [[Margaret River (wine region)|Margaret River]]. Region IV includes portions of the [[Napa Valley AVA|Napa Valley]], [[Stellenbosch]], [[Corsica]], [[Tuscany]], and [[Alentejo]] where the warmer climates allow for the ripening of later varieties such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon|Cabernet sauvignon]], [[Sangiovese]], and [[Syrah]]. The warmest areas are found in Region V and include areas in the [[Central Valley (California)|central valley of California]], inland [[Australia]] and wine producing regions in [[Morocco]], [[Madeira]], [[Apulia]], and [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]].

==Issues and limitations==
There are numerous issues and limitations associated with the use of growing degree-days. First, the Winkler index and its classification of climate regions by growing degree-days only describe one aspect of an area's climate—mean daily temperature. Many other important factors which contribute to a region's suitability for viticulture (and its [[terroir]]) are excluded; among them sun exposure, [[latitude]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], soil conditions, and the risk of extreme weather which might damage grapevines (e.g., winter freezes, spring and fall frosts, hail, etc.).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As originally developed the climates of California were defined for relatively large areas using only one or two climate stations. This macroscale approach will invariably not capture the microscale influences that are an important aspect of growing any crop. To address these issues research has been increasingly using spatial climate data to better depict within region and even within vineyard differences in climate&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and therefore ripening and wine style potential. To create spatially appropriate climate data numerous stations and/or sensors are used to collect data which can then be interpolated over the landscape due to known interactions with elevation, aspect, slope, and distance to the coast or other water bodies using [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=C.|last2=Halbleib|first2=M.|last3=Smith|first3=J.I.|last4=Gibson|first4=W.P.|last5=Doggett|first5=M.K.|last6=Taylor|first6=G.H.|last7=Curtis|first7=J.|last8=Pasteris|first8=P.P.|date=|year=2008|title=Physiographically sensitive mapping of climatological temperature and precipitation across the conterminous United States|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1688/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=28|issue=15|pages=2031–2064|doi=10.1002/joc.1688|issn=1097-0088|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of depicting a region as all one Winkler region ([[Napa Valley AVA]] being a Region III for example), spatial data summaries&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; show the Napa Valley having a full range of Winkler regions, 12% a Region II, 56% a Region III, and 30% a Region IV (whereas the table above shows one station in Napa, St. Helena as being a Region IV).

Other significant differences exist depending on the time period of the data and formula used for calculating growing degree-days. First, to be comparable growing degree-day numbers from various sources need to come from the same time period.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to both a variable climate and [[climate change]], a comparison of a ten-year period from the 1970s and the 2000s would be inappropriate as the variation and trends over time would make them incomparable. Furthermore, a sufficient time period is suggested to allow the averaging to smooth out some of the variability. The standard time period in use is the [[climatological normal]] period of 30 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/grr/climatenormals|title=About Climate Normals|last=National Weather Service|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather|website=www.weather.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; however if 30 years of data is not available then at the minimum five years should be used. However a five-year period is not directly comparable to a 30-year period. How data are averaged (i.e., hourly, daily, or monthly) is also very important. While weather stations today can average data to an hour, a minutes or even seconds, historical data used to calculate growing degree-days has been done mostly on daily or monthly averages (the table above was done using monthly climatological normals). Shorter term averaging to minutes, or more commonly hourly, arguably better reflects the true thermal effects on the crops, but will result in growing degree-day values that are lower than both daily and monthly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battany|first=M.|year=2009|title=Improving degree-day calculations|url=|journal=Practical Winery Vineyard|volume=May/June|pages=25–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monthly averaged data can be very problematic as it can underestimate heat accumulation during the first and last months of the growing season. Therefore, it is paramount that one know the time period that the growing degree-day values are calculated from so as to be comparable.

The Winkler index uses the standard method of calculating growing degree-days in viticulture and is based on using a base temperature of 50&amp;nbsp;°F (10&amp;nbsp;°C) with no upper temperature cut-off. The first issue is that 50&amp;nbsp;°F (10&amp;nbsp;°C) is not likely the best base temperature even though it is the most commonly used value. Even the early research on this topicstressed that the base temperature threshold for accumulation for early versus late budding varieties is likely strongly cultivar specific.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Various research worldwide has pointed to base temperatures ranging from 39 to 45&amp;nbsp;°F (4 to 7&amp;nbsp;°C), but there has been little confirmation of these thresholds across numerous wine regions and for a wider range of varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia de Cortázar-Atauri|first=I.|last2=Brisson|first2=N.|last3=Gaudillere|first3=J.P.|date=|year=2009|title=Performance of several models for predicting budburst date of grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-009-0217-4|journal=International Journal of Biometeorology|language=en|volume=53|issue=4|pages=317–326|doi=10.1007/s00484-009-0217-4|issn=0020-7128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end of the formula, the calculation for growing degree-days used in [[viticulture]] and [[Winemaking|wine production]] does not normally use an upper cut-off. Conceptually an upper cut-off would be applied if the plant system stopped being photosynthetically active at some point due to heat stress from high temperatures. While this may be proven for some crops, there is not a universal number for an upper threshold for grapes so the majority of the published data for comparison purposes in [[viticulture]] and [[wine production]] does not limit maximum temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wine science : principles, practice, perception|last=Jackson|first=R.S.|date=|publisher=Academic Press|year=2000|isbn=012379062X|location=San Diego|pages=|oclc=162129379|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue is problematic because many weather stations today have integrated the corn growing degree-day method in their software. The corn growing degree-day method uses both a base temperature adjustment and an upper threshold,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ndawn.ndsu.nodak.edu/help-corn-growing-degree-days.html|title=NDAWN Corn Growing Degree Days Information|website=ndawn.ndsu.nodak.edu|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither of which are common in [[viticulture]] and wine production use, and can confound any comparison with published data using the simple average method.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Furthermore, more complex climate indices have been introduced to address perceived shortcomings in the Winkler index including the Huglin Index,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; the Biologically Effective Degree-Day Index,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38326786|title=Viticulture and Environment|last=Gladstones|first=J.S.|date=|publisher=Winetitles|year=1992|isbn=9781875130122|location=|pages=|oclc=38326786|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Multicriteria Climatic Classification system (Geoviticulture MCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonietto|first=J.|last2=Carbonneau|first2=A.|date=|year=2004|title=A multicriteria climatic classification system for grape-growing regions worldwide|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192304000115|journal=Agricultural and Forest Meteorology|volume=124|issue=1–2|pages=81–97|doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2003.06.001|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These indices attempt to account for day length and solar, frost, and drought variability that can be found in different locations. Each have been used in various research settings,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but have some limitations to the general user in that some variables needed to calculate the indices are not readily available from all weather/climate stations and/or to the general public.

Overall each of these issues needs to be carefully considered when comparing growing degree-day values from published data in magazines, books, scientific articles, and even from growers in the same region.
